You have been fair and firm to all Members. You have also ensured that order and decorum were observed. I am sure all the Members here will continue to give you our full support so that the business of this House is conducted with dignity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also priviledged to have Mr Eugene Yap as our Deputy Speaker again when he is duly re-elected next week. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been elected by the people to look after their interest. As I have said in this House about six months ago, a high standard of personal integrity and honesty is expected of Members of Parliament. We must perform our duties seriously, and not abuse the privileges conferred upon us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you recall, Sir, in the Fifth and Sixth Parliament, the Committee of Privileges had to be convened on several occasions to discipline a Member who had breached parliamentary privileges. In the Eighth Parliament, the Committee of Privileges had to look into the breach of privileges by some strangers. We hope that no Member or stranger will give us cause to convene the Committee of Privileges in this Ninth Parliament. I have no doubt, Sir, that you will not hesitate to take any Member to task if he abuses parliamentary privileges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on behalf of the senior Members, may I also extend a very warm welcome to the new Members who have just joined this House. They will find this an enriching and rewarding experience. We look forward to their maiden speeches. Indeed, I hope that all Members will participate actively in the proceedings of this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the privilege of first meeting you exactly 20 years ago in May 1977 when I first entered the House as a new Member. I have also observed you, first, as a Backbencher from May 1977, Deputy Speaker for the period March 1985 to January 1989, and the Speaker of this House since 1989. Through these years, I have come to hold you in high regard and respect for the clarity and conciseness of your speeches and your absolute fairness to all. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about the Speaker's eyes which we must catch before we are allowed to speak. They range from selective viewing to myopia and sometimes complete closure. I can assure Members, especially those who are new in this House, that the Speaker's eyes are crystal clear at all times. You have given opportunities to all who wish to address the House, be they Ministers, Frontbenchers, Backbenchers, NCMPs and NMPs. I should, however, add my caution to new Members in this House that the Speaker is deadly serious when he said, \"Speeches should be short and sweet.\" You would not want to test his patience unduly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I add my congratulations to your re-election. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, I wish to congratulate your election again as Speaker of the Ninth Parliament. I have found you to be a fair Speaker at the last Parliament and I believe you will continue to be fair in this Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to seek a clarification. I wrote to Parliament requesting to sit together with my Secretary-General, J.B. Jeyaretnam, and the reply dated 12th May 1997 from Parliament was that the Speaker had not acceded to the request. Would Mr Speaker clarify and explain the rationale for not acceding to my request? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, I do not think this is the appropriate moment to raise such a matter.

Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I join my Parliamentary colleagues to commend you on your re-election as the Speaker. I must say that you are a very passionate as well as a very patient Speaker. For my new Parliamentary colleagues, I hope that they will learn what our Speaker is passionate about so that they will be able to discuss and present topics which are of interest to the House as a whole. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have known you for more than a decade. When I first started, I had been rather long in my speeches but over the years, I have learned to be precise, because I kept watching you and having acquired the art of looking at your eyes now, I manage to be precise and concise. I hope that my new Parliamentary colleagues and others would not hesitate to bring up various topics which are of interest to the House as well as to Singaporeans. I am sure, Mr Speaker, Sir, you will continue to be patient to allow Members to express various viewpoints which will be of interest to Singaporeans. You will have more good years in listening to what we have to present. And I wish you all the best for the sessions you would be chairing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member): Mr Speaker, Sir, as a Member returning to this House after some absence, may I also add my congratulations to your election as Speaker of this House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by your election, you have accepted a responsibility for the people of Singapore. We need to remind ourselves that this is the people's assembly. It is to this House that the people will look for their grievances, for their hopes, for their aspirations to be met and discussed. And I am sure, Mr Speaker, Sir, that you, in the discharge of your responsibility to the people, will give adequate recognition to the need for the people's voice to be heard in this Parliament - their grievances, their complaints, their hopes and their aspirations for Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say, speaking for myself, that I am delighted to be back in this House of the people. And my delight is all the more when I see the joy on the faces of the Frontbench opposite me. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Please allow me to join the other colleagues in congratulating you once again to be elected as the Speaker of Parliament. This is my 13th year and I \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have found no difficulty in catching your eye. Now that I have been moved to the front, I think that task of catching your eye is even much easier. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Honourable Members, it has been a privilege for me to serve as Speaker in the last two Parliaments and you do me a great honour by re-electing me as Speaker of this Ninth Parliament. I am overwhelmed by the generous sentiments expressed by the Leader of the House and the other Members and for their assurances of cooperation. It is this spirit of cooperation that made my task easy in the past and I hope that with your support again I will be able to discharge my duties fully and responsibly and in a manner worthy of the confidence you have placed in me. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House is an august place where Members argue and debate, probe and query, and criticize and defend policies and laws. We bring our collective wisdom and experiences together to lay down policies and legislate laws that reflect the will and meet the aspirations of the people who have elected us. Members should let their conscience be their guide and speak their minds freely, but in doing so we must be aware that we have rules to abide by and we must uphold decorum in the House. Our proceedings are governed by the Standing Orders. Complex these rules may be at times, but the Standing Orders provide an important mechanism for the functioning of the House and ensure that our proceedings are carried out expeditiously and in a fair and orderly manner. Above all, we must always bear in mind that we must conduct ourselves in a manner befitting the dignity of this House and never abuse the privileges accorded to us as Members of Parliament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to extend a warm welcome to the 23 new Members. Like you I was once new in this House but I found my older colleagues more than willing to help me adjust to Parliamentary life. I am sure that you will find your senior colleagues ready to assist you. The staff of Parliament will also be on hand to provide you with the necessary assistance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that you are all raring to partake in the cut and thrust of Parliamentary debate and we look forward to hearing your maiden speeches. Parliamentary debate is serious business and at times it can be tedious. We should not play to the gallery but we can bring some sparkle to our deliberations by adding zest and occasional humour. Speak as much as you need to and as is permitted by the Standing Orders, for that is what our citizens expect you to do. Do remember, however, that good speeches do not necessarily mean long speeches. A long rambling speech, as has been pointed out by some Members already, can be a bane to the Speaker. And as a fellow Speaker once told me, a Member in his Parliament who once made an unnecessarily long speech somehow encountered immense difficulty catching his eye thereafter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, if Members would bear with me, permit me now to tell you a story. This is about Calvin Coolidge who became President of the United States of America when his predecessor died in office in 1923. His political slogan was \"Keeping cool with Coolidge\", which stood for, amongst other things, the fact that he was not easily ruffled. Coolidge was often brief and to the point, in fact, so brief that he was noted for his closed-mouth and was nicknamed `Silent Cal'. Well, the story goes like this. A reporter once asked him, \"Mr President, what do you think about Prohibition?\" \"No comment\", replied Coolidge. \"Will you say something about unemployment?\", asked the reporter again. \"No\", came the reply. \"Will you give us your views of the world situation?\", persuaded the exasperated reporter. \"No\", was the reply from the President. Just as the disappointed reporter started to leave, Coolidge said, \"Wait\". Hopefully the man turned around with earnest anticipation, only to hear Coolidge remind him, \"Please don't quote me.\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another story has it that a lady who sat down next to Coolidge at dinner told him: \"Mr President, I've just made a bet with a friend that I can get you to say more than two words to me by the time this meal is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> over.\". Turning to the lady, Coolidge replied, \"You lose.\" and kept quiet the rest of the evening. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more to the story of Calvin Coolidge. It seems that when he died and the announcement of his death was made to the press, a reporter stood up and asked, \"Are you sure?\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coolidge's disinclination to speak did not hurt him. In fact, so popular was he that in 1924 Coolidge was elected to another term in one of the biggest landslides in US Presidential elections history. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral of the story is this. We need not have the taciturnity of `Silent Cal' but you see, Honourable Members, brevity does have its virtues. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore wish Honourable Members well and look forward to your participation in the business of the House. [Applause.] \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform Honourable Members that the President will be present in the Chamber at 8.30 pm to deliver his Speech at the Opening of Parliament. I therefore suspend the sitting until 8.30 pm this evening. Order. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>at 4.12 pm until 8.30 pm.</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <i>Sitting resumed at 8.30 pm</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President (accompanied by two A.D.C.s) entered the Chamber, accompanied by Mr Speaker, who was preceded by the Serjeant at Arms (without the Mace), the Principal Assistant Clerk (2), the Principal Assistant Clerk (1) and the Clerk. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Clerk announcing \"The President\", the President delivered his Opening Speech. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President: The Asia Pacific region is prospering. Our Asean neighbours are doing well. Asean will soon admit Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar to become an association of ten countries. China continues to grow dramatically. We hope that China-US relations will continue along the path of constructive engagement, and that this policy of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> President Clinton will not be upset by Congress or the US media. Good US-China relations are crucial to the stability of the whole region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our neighbours' progress offers abundant opportunities for Singapore companies and entrepreneurs, to trade, invest, and provide services. But it also means fiercer competition for us. Our neighbours are moving into niches which we recently occupied, seeking high quality investments, launching ambitious strategic projects. They are building up capabilities in areas of our traditional strengths - such as port, airport, and financial services. We welcome fair market competition. It will spur us to improve, and stay ahead. We will also cooperate with our neighbours even as we compete. Economic growth need not be a zero-sum game, as it expands the pie for all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestically, we are doing well. Productivity has been improving steadily. Our economy is upgrading and restructuring, and continues to grow steadily. We have managed to stay competitive despite tougher competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, prospects for Singapore have seldom looked better. We are well placed to seize the opportunities, to transform Singapore and make Singapore our best home. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the last general elections, the PAP Government set out its Singapore 21 programme to achieve this. The programme has five pillars: create wealth, share success, invest in the young, look after the old, and build ties. Singaporeans have given Singapore 21 their full support. We must now work together to create an outstanding living environment for our families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will upgrade our physical environment, and build Singapore into a city of excellence. We will develop a vibrant and interesting city centre, especially along the Singapore River, Fort Canning and the waterfront, and in the new Marina South. New towns like Punggol 21 will integrate high quality HDB and private housing, convenient public transport, and varied recreational amenities. We will revitalise \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> older HDB estates through the Estate Renewal Strategy, and the Main and Interim Upgrading Programmes. No part of Singapore should be left behind as we progress. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will expand and improve the public transport system, by building new MRT and LRT lines. The Electronic Road Pricing system will enable us to make the best use of our road network, and allow more people to own and use cars. With ingenuity, we can overcome the constraints of our small size. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will foster a gracious society. To make Singapore a pleasant place to live, it is not enough just to have handsome buildings and efficient transportation. Singaporeans must be courteous to one another, considerate of one another's needs, and well adapted to living conditions in our dense city. In schools and in society, we must gradually get people to care more for one another, to maintain a healthy balance between material and non-material pursuits, and to cultivate interests in culture and the arts. A gracious society will also attract more talent to live and work in Singapore, and contribute to our economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will build a nation where everyone has a stake in Singapore's success, feels a sense of belonging and ownership, and wants to contribute to make Singapore our best home. The HDB home ownership scheme has been an important means of doing this. The Government's asset enhancement schemes, such as the CPF top ups, share ownership schemes and HDB upgrading programmes, take this idea a step further. Provided we stay competitive and the economy continues to prosper, we will have more such schemes to enable Singaporeans to share in the nation's success. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fair and open meritocratic system offers full and equal opportunities to all. Rewards depend only on each person's ability and performance, regardless of his race, language or religion. We often take meritocracy for granted, and forget how rare and precious it is. Meritocracy is not just an efficient way to organise our economy. It is a core value which we uphold and protect. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these goals, we must develop our talent and educate our people to the maximum. In the information age, prosperity depends less on natural resources and geographical advantage, than on human intelligence and social organisation. They are our strengths. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will therefore invest heavily in education. By international standards, our education system is already very good. Our pupils score high in international achievement tests in science and mathematics. NUS and NTU graduates who continue their studies overseas regularly distinguish themselves. But we can do much better. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers are a key link in our education system. We have reformed the teaching service to make a teaching career more attractive. We are giving schools more resources and autonomy, to help teachers do their job better. We are building new and better schools to replace the older ones. We are investing heavily in a school Information Technology programme, to get teachers and pupils to learn about IT and use IT, a key competence for the future. Every child will have access to computers and the Internet, whether or not his parents can afford a computer at home. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our aim is not just to improve a few schools, but to raise the quality of education across the board. Many students who graduate from schools today will still be working in 50 years' time. We must try to foresee their needs in the next century, when technology will change faster than ever. Lifelong learning, flexibility and creativity will be crucial. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must anticipate the problems of an aging population, and tackle them early while they are still tractable. The number of senior citizens is growing rapidly. Many families already face the problems of looking after aged parents or relatives. Many more will do so. This involves many issues - housing, transport, health, welfare. It involves multiple agencies - the Ministries of Health and Community Development, HDB, CPF Board, NTUC, the National Council of Social Services, to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> name a few. Their actions must be coordinated and practical plans worked out to alleviate the problem. We owe this to the older generation who built today's Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must imbue in our people a sense of history and identity. The transition to a post-independence generation of Singaporeans is well underway. We must pass on to them the same discipline, the same drive to achieve, the same indomitable will to overcome problems that the first generation had, qualities that have brought Singapore so far. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first generation lived through the tumultuous events before and after independence. The post-independence generation grew up in a different environment - peaceful, stable, and prosperous. Their life experiences are different. Nevertheless, they must learn how we became a nation, how we are different from other countries, and why we must always make a special effort, and always stay ahead of others in order to thrive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence our schools will focus more on National Education. We will also get our population who have left school to understand the realities of living in our region, to realise that although our prospects can be bright, failure to stay competitive will dim them. From time to time we must expect rough weather, even in tranquil seasons, and despite the most careful navigation. These squalls are a useful reminder to Singaporeans of the realities of our external environment. If we handle them calmly and steadily, the shared experience of difficulties overcome together will strengthen our solidarity, confidence and sense of identity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans need to bond more closely to become one people. We compete as individuals to get the best out of each person, but we must also work together and care for one another to do well as one country. Our survival depends on the strength of these ties among ourselves, and between Singaporeans and their leaders. If the national consensus on key issues breaks down, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> or if some segments of society feel neglected or alienated, Singapore will start to unravel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all draw upon the opportunities and resources the country has provided us. Some do better, others less well. But all have contributed to Singapore's success, and to the system which has allowed able Singaporeans to do well and get ahead. So the successful ones have a responsibility to come forward and help the less successful. Each of us should contribute back to society more than what we have gained from it. Only then can we foster greater social cohesion and resilience in the next generation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Development Councils are one outlet for this spirit of voluntarism. The Councils will involve successful Singaporeans in social programmes to help the less successful. They will give each community more say over their own programmes, and strengthen the sense of mutual obligation and gratitude between the helpers and the helped. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge before us is formidable, because now the economic competition is tougher, and we are aiming higher. But we have no reason to be daunted. We are much stronger now than in 1965: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We have a well-diversified and globalised economy, with strong and deep \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trading links not only with countries in the region but also with the US and the European Union. We are not over-exposed or vulnerable to problems with any one economic partner. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We have put aside sizeable reserves during our years of high growth to see us through difficult times. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We enjoy political and social stability. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We have built up top class infrastructure, and offer investors an outstanding business environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We have an honest, and competent government, and a well-educated, bilingual workforce, keen and productive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. We have expanded our talent pool, and put our bestpeople into the most crucial posts, in business, government, and the SAF. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are reasons to be confident, not complacent. In 1965, when prospects seemed bleak, we defied the odds, survived and prospered. Domestic and regional conditions are far more favourable now than 32 years ago. We have the will, the resources and the experience to thrive and flourish. We can realise our common vision, and make Singapore the best home for ourselves and our children. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at Eleven\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Minutes to Nine o'clock pm.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADDENDA TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>THE FIRST SESSION OF THE NINTH PARLIAMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>ON MONDAY, 26TH MAY, 1997</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   RAdm Teo Chee Hean\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Education\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Introduction</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We will invest heavily in our young. How well they learn and how they feel about Singapore and their role in society will determine our future. They must acquire the knowledge, skills and values to keep Singapore a cohesive and successful society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. By international standards, we have a very good education system. Our schools educate children according to their abilities, and they graduate with skills which are in demand on the job market. Wastage rates are low. But we must continue improving the system, to ensure that it measures up to the demands of the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will focus on four main areas: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. We will review our curriculum and assessment systems, and introduce IT in every school, in order to develop in pupils the ability to think creatively and learn independently. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. We will strengthen National Education to ensure the next generation remains resilient and cohesive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. We will give schools more resources, and greater authority to use these resources to raise the quality of education. We will strengthen the management and supervisory structures for schools, to support them better, and to obtain timely feedback on how policies are working out in the classroom. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. We will attract more top students into NUS and NTU, both local and foreign, and develop the two universities into world class institutions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Developing Creative, Independent Learners</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We must develop our young to think creatively and apply knowledge in innovative ways, while recognising the wide \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> range of abilities among pupils. We will revise the school curriculum to stretch but not overload our pupils. We will reduce the amount of factual knowledge they must acquire, and do more to build thinking and process skills. We will review the system of assessment of both schools and pupils to meet this objective, while maintaining rigorous standards. MOE will also extend the Thinking Skills Programme to all secondary schools by 2000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will implement an IT Masterplan to provide every school with an integrated IT infrastructure. A comprehensive training programme will give teachers the skills and confidence to use IT effectively. Every child will learn in an IT-enriched school environment, whether or not his parents can afford computers at home. Teachers and pupils will use multi-media and the Internet daily for teaching and learning. Within five years, pupils will spend up to 30% of curriculum time learning through computers so as to develop habits of independent and continuous learning. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>National Education</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Schools must focus more sharply on National Education to instil in our young a strong sense of shared identity and confidence in our future. We will teach every pupil the facts of how we became a nation, why our constraints and vulnerabilities make us different from other countries and why we must continue to work together and outperform others to succeed in future. We will also use the informal curriculum in schools to develop group spirit among pupils and commitment to community and nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Making our schools better</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will give all schools more resources, and authority to use them as they deem fit, for educational, administrative, or staff development purposes. We will also build up the structures for managing and supervising schools, to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> provide them better guidance and support and to gather timely feedback on educational policies and the curriculum. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We can learn useful lessons from the experience of the independent and autonomous schools. Successful innovations will be spread to other schools wherever feasible. We will also set up more autonomous schools. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will make all secondary schools single session by the year 2000 to give them the scope to implement a wider range of programmes for the all-round development of pupils. We will also build new, upgraded primary schools to replace the old ones in the older estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Building a high quality teaching force</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. MOE will build a high quality and motivated teaching force by keeping teaching careers attractive and competitive. The recent radical reforms in the Education Service have boosted recruitment, and helped us to retain good teachers. We will actively promote teachers based on the new framework over the next few years, in order to recognise good work, dedication and ability. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We have set up a talent management scheme to track, groom and test out promising officers with leadership potential, and advance them without delay. Outstanding teachers who prefer to continue teaching in classrooms will also be recognised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will implement a Professional Development Plan to train and develop teachers throughout their careers. We will reach out to all teachers continuously to get feedback and keep them updated on relevant national issues and educational policies. We must get all teachers to recognise the vital importance of their mission. How they mould the young will determine if we stay a cohesive and successful nation beyond the first generation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Helping Underachievers And Special Learners</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We have a pilot programme to identify and help underachievers and slow \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> learners at the lower primary level. These pupils receive special help to overcome their learning deficits. We will extend this programme to all primary schools by 1998. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. We will do more for children with disabilities who can become productive and useful if given corrective help and training, for example the dyslexic, visually handicapped, or deaf. Many of the parents are highly motivated to do something for their children, whether in special schools or integrated into normal classes. Provided they can find volunteers and staff, MOE will help with more resources, in terms of funds, buildings, equipment, and specialist staff. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>World Class Universities</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. NUS and NTU will strive to become world-class universities. They will educate graduates who compare with the best in the world and who will contribute to Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. The universities will attract more top local students and put them through rigorous and well-rounded programmes to produce future leaders in economy and society. They will also attract bright foreign students, who should fill 20% of their intake by 2000. Foreign students will add vibrancy to our campuses and enhance the educational experience of Singapore students. The universities will admit students on a need-blind basis, guaranteeing financial assistance to all students, local or foreign, who meet the entry standards and who need the assistance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. We will raise the intake of students into Engineering and the Sciences to 60% of total intake, to meet the needs of a more technology-intensive economy. NUS and NTU will also double postgraduate intake by the year 2000, as they strive to become research and intellectual hubs in Asia. The universities will attract top faculty and deepen collaboration with outstanding universities and research organisations abroad. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. Singaporeans will have more opportunities for tertiary education. Singapore Institute of Management (SIM) \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will expand their finance and business courses with a view to eventually developing SIM into a private university. LaSalle-SIA College of the Arts (LaSalle) and Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) will upgrade their courses with LaSalle developing as a centre for the Visual and Performing Arts with an emphasis on Western and South-East Asian cultures and NAFA concentrating on developing Fine Arts and Design focusing particularly on Oriental cultures. The Government will assist the three institutions to expand by helping them to improve their administration and by providing finance for the building projects and giving them an annual grant to defray their operating expenses. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>World Class Technical Education</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. We will provide a world-class technical education for the bulk of the future workforce. When the new Nanyang Polytechnic campus is completed in 1998, the four polytechnics will take in 16,000 students a year, or 40% of each age cohort. They will improve their courses to give students a sound grasp of fundamentals, practical skills to meet job requirements, and the flexibility to pick up new skills in future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. The Institute of Technical Education (ITE) will become a post-secondary institution of excellence. With 3 new institutes in place by 2000, it will have modern facilities to provide high quality skills training for 10,000 secondary school leavers. It will also provide continuing education programmes to help adult workers upgrade. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PUBLIC SERVICE DIVISION (PMO)</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   BG Lee Hsien Loong\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Deputy Prime Minister\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Serving Singaporeans - Today, Tomorrow</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Singapore Public Service will work with the elected government to shape Singapore's future, forge a common vision among Singaporeans and transform this vision into reality. The goal is a dynamic, successful and vibrant nation of excellence, with a safe, secure and stable environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. In a world of constant and rapid change, the Public Service cannot just keep up with developments in Singapore and abroad. It must also point and lead the way forward. It must develop and facilitate programmes for national growth, and be a model for efficiency, innovation and service quality. If creativity and enterprise are key elements for Singapore's continuing success, the Public Service must exemplify and promote these attributes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>PS21 - Public Service for the 21st Century</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. PS21 - Public Service for the 21st Century - is the Public Service's programme for meeting the challenges ahead. Our public service must be one of the best in the world. The thrust of PS21 is to make public officers \"activists for change\" - open to continuous improvement, and receptive to continuous learning. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Public Service has to be forward-looking and adaptable. Ministries will use scenario-based planning to help them anticipate the future. The Public Service must go beyond the role of regulator and controller, to also be facilitator and nurturer in building up a thriving private sector, and a citizenry active in community and national life. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Excellence in Service</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Singaporeans have steadily rising expectations for quality and excellence in the delivery of public services. We will harness information technology to the maximum. At the same time we need the human face and personal touch. The Public Service will emphasise customer orientation to serve the public with constantly improving standards of quality and efficiency, courtesy and convenience. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>People the Key</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. How forward-looking, progressive and capable the Public Service can be will depend on the quality of its people. This requires good personnel management practices in recruiting, assessing, training, developing, motivating and rewarding public officers at all levels. We will make \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more use of psychometric instruments in selecting and deploying officers. These will look beyond educational attainments to their other personal qualities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will make the employment structure more flexible, to help us deploy and develop serving officers, and open up flexible work opportunities for housewives, students and retirees. We will develop and refine comprehensive and rigorous systems to assess performance and potential, the key factors in appointing and promoting officers. We must keep terms of service competitive, and pay attention to the personal well being of staff members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. To harness the creativity and ability of every officer requires bold, discerning leadership, open to new ideas and contrary views. The Public Service will do more in management and leadership development, and training on the principles of governance and the practice of policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The Government will continue to offer undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships to keep up a continuing flow of top talent into the public sector. It will adjust scholarship terms as necessary to keep them attractive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will continue to devolve responsibility and authority to autonomous agencies in government. Senior officers will have to spend more time on personnel issues. Ministries will be given more authority in personnel decisions, to respond better to their particular needs and circumstances. The Public Service Division will increasingly take on the role of setting standards and auditing practices. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. The Public Service targets for every officer to receive at least 100 hours of training a year by the Year 2000. Every officer will, working with his supervisor, develop an individual training roadmap to plan his training needs. Every supervisor will be a trainer, spending time to develop his officers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. The training arms of the Civil Service College - the Institute of Policy Development and the Institute of Public \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Administration - play pivotal roles in transforming the Public Service. Both institutes will be staffed with competent instructors, and will be moving into new premises fitted with the latest facilities. The College's Consulting Group will advise and assist ministries in training and developing their staff. The Civil Service College will also house the ASEAN Resource Centre for Management Innovations, a collective effort with the other ASEAN Civil Services to gather and propagate new ideas and practices to improve performance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Mr Yeo Cheow Tong\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Health\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Ministry of Health aims to nurture a healthy nation by promoting good health, by emphasising prevention, and by providing good health care at affordable prices. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Nurturing a Healthy Nation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We will continue to stress personal responsibility in maintaining one's own health, and saving for one's health expenses. We will promote disease prevention programmes, and healthy lifestyles including physical activity and good nutrition. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Ensuring Good and Affordable Health Care</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. As incomes rise, so will demand for medical services and expectations of higher standards of care. We are upgrading our health care system to improve the standard of health care delivered, and to deliver good health care to every segment of the population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We have built a new Institute of Health and National Dental Centre. We have opened 7 new-generation polyclinics and are completing 2 more in Chua Chu Kang and the Central area. New polyclinics are also planned for Yishun and Pasir Ris. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We have built two new hospitals: New Changi Hospital, and the Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital. A third, the new Tan Tock Seng Hospital, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will be ready by 1999. We will build another hospital in the Western part of the island. We will develop these into regional hospitals, and encourage each hospital to excel in 1 or 2 speciality areas, to build up their reputation and get Singa poreans living nearby to use them as their hospital of choice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. At the same time, the Ministry will keep basic medical services affordable. Polyclinics, specialist outpatient services and Class B2 and C hospital beds will continue to be subsidised heavily. We will build enough Class B2 and C beds to meet demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The Medisave, MediShield and Medifund schemes will ensure that health care remains cost-effective and sustainable. We will encourage Singaporeans who have opted out of MediShield to opt in, and persuade all Singaporeans to provide MediShield coverage for their dependants. Medifund will be the safety net for those who cannot afford the subsidised charges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The Ministry will review the progress in implementing the 1993 White Paper on Affordable Health Care. We will examine the need to control balance billing by private specialists and hospitals whose patients use Medisave. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will maintain high professional standards in private hospitals and medical clinics, through licensing, regulation and auditing of healthcare establishments. We will review the Medical Registration Act and set up a Register of Specialists. We will enhance penalties for unauthorised medical practitioners, to protect the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will follow through the implementation of the Advance Medical Directive Act. The AMD Register will be opened this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will review the supply and remuneration of doctors, nurses and paramedical professionals. We must retain and reward talent in the public sector in order to achieve medical excellence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Pursuing Medical Excellence</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will promote medical excellence. Being the regional medical hub will help Singaporeans to enjoy a high standard of medical care without compromising on affordability. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We will strive for excellence in specific speciality areas. We already have 3 national centres specialising in skin, eye and heart diseases. In 1998, the Singapore Cancer Centre will be completed. It will be the tertiary centre for treatment, teaching and research in the field of cancer. The Neuroscience Institute, to be ready by 1999, will play a similar role in neurological diseases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. New medical technologies will generate new demand. The Ministry will ensure proper trade-offs between the potentially high costs of these new techniques and their benefits in terms of better treatment outcomes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. We will help to upgrade the practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Health Services for the Elderly</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. The Ministry will pay special attention to the healthcare needs of the elderly. Two new community hospitals will be built - one at the former site of Toa Payoh Hospital, and the other in Simei. The Ministry is assisting 14 Voluntary Welfare Organisations to plan and construct new nursing homes. By the year 2000, we will have 6,500 nursing home beds, 50% more than at present, and 10 new day centres providing day care and rehabilitation services. Home care services, including home nursing and home help services, will also be expanded to cater to the elderly sick who live at home. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Mr Abdullah Tarmugi\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Community Development\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. MCD will foster a cohesive, compassionate and robust society, strengthening families and promoting maximum community participation. It will work closely with civic, community and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> self-help groups and voluntary welfare organisations to raise the level and variety of community support services. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Enhancing Social Cohesion - Community Development Councils</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We have established two Community Development Councils (CDCs) in March 1997. We will set up more Community Development Councils (CDCs) to foster community bonding. CDCs will give communities more say in developing and managing educational, recreational, child care and senior citizens' facilities, and disbursing financial help to those in need. The CDCs will involve successful Singaporeans in looking after their communities, especially the less successful members, and strengthen the bonds that bind us together. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The People's Association will review the structures and activities of its grassroots organisations, and upgrade facilities in Residents' Committees, Community Centres and Community Clubs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Feedback Unit will reach out to more Singaporeans to obtain varied and representative feedback. It will also inform and explain to opinion makers and grassroots leaders the rationale and details of government policies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>A More Compassionate Society</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. In partnership with the CDCs and other voluntary organisations, the Ministry will provide social services for the needy and disadvantaged. It will reach out to families in distress, low-income families, the elderly, the disabled and children in need. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. The Ministry will work with the National Council of Social Service, voluntary welfare organisations and self-help groups to strengthen the network of community social services. Government will continue to provide grants to help fund the activities of these voluntary groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Strengthening Families</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will continue to promote and strengthen traditional family values and adopt a family approach to problem \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> solving. The Family Life and Parent Education Programme will foster closer family bonds and encourage families to spend meaningful time together. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will build more Child Care Centres for pre-school children. We will fund Before-and-After-School Care centres to help working parents. These centres will keep otherwise unsupervised school-age children away from undesirable influences and enable more parents to combine work with family responsibilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will continue to help low-income families through schemes like the Small Families Improvement Scheme, Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme and Centre-Based Financial Assistance Scheme for Child Care. The focus will be to help children in these families break out of the poverty trap. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Senior Citizens</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Senior citizens should continue to play active and valued roles in the community. Senior citizens clubs, Befriender Service and RC-based Mutual Help Groups will keep elderly people socially active, relieve their loneliness and provide mutual help, particularly in times of illness and distress. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will encourage Singaporeans to prepare early for retirement, and to remain socially and physically active as they become senior citizens. We will promote positive attitudes towards ageing and filial responsibility. Respect for elders should be an integral value in our gracious society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will encourage families to keep elderly members living with them. Those who are frail and cannot be left at home when their family members are at work can attend social day centres which will provide supervision and opportunities for socialising. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Together with HDB, we will continue to implement the Project to Improve Living Conditions of the Elderly. We will set up more senior activity centres to care for the elderly living in selected 1-room rental flats, and build sheltered homes for the aged. Voluntary welfare \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> organisations will provide support to the residents. Thus elderly who are frail, destitute or unable to live with their families can stay together and maintain their links with the community. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>A Fit and Robust Society</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. To foster a healthy and fit population and improve the quality of life, we will provide a wide range of sports programmes for all age groups. We will develop one-stop, integrated sports and recreational complexes in HDB estates. In the Sports For Life Programme, we will set up 15 Regional Sports and Fitness Centres at existing sports complexes. This will bring sports and fitness facilities that cater to the whole family closer to the community. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Youth Participation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Younger Singaporeans are better educated, more qualified and hold better jobs. They bring dynamism, fresh ideas and a can-do attitude to bear on the tasks they undertake. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. The National Youth Council will work with voluntary groups and the private sector to maximise the potential of young Singaporeans, foster social cohesion and national identity, and maximise their contributions to society. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>MUIS</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. The Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS) will work with the community and other Malay/Muslim organisations to strengthen religious values and family units. MUIS will achieve this through mosques and other Muslim organisations to make the best use of resources. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Self-help Groups</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. Community self-help groups will continue to focus on raising educational levels for students and workers' training. They have given the communities confidence, and the less able members hope that they too will be helped to improve and catch up. Every community has made significant gains. Self-help groups have also worked hard at preventive programmes for youths. They will consolidate and expand these programmes over \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the next few years. They will also create more opportunities to share programmes and facilities for the common good. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To make Singapore our best home in the 21st Century, we need a firm foundation of national security. Singaporeans must remain committed to the defence of the country. A strong defence is the best guarantee of peace, stability and prosperity. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Importance of a Strong SAF</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To deter aggressors, the SAF must always be strong and operationally-ready. Today the SAF is a well-integrated, balanced and credible fighting force. We will continue to develop and improve its capabilities to keep Singapore safe in the 21st Century. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. People. The most important determinant of the quality of the SAF is its people. MINDEF will continue to recruit and retain able and committed men and women to lead the SAF. It will constantly find ways to use our limited manpower better, to employ them more effectively and raise their efficiency and productivity. MINDEF will also ensure that an SAF career is attractive and rewarding. Initiatives like the \"Warrant Officer and Specialist 21 Development Masterplan\" will improve the job nature, structure, sponsorship schemes, career paths and career transition for corps personnel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Technology. The SAF will continue to harness technology as a force multiplier, to compensate for our small size and limited resources, and stay ahead. MINDEF will strengthen its strategic technological and industrial capabilities and defence research and development. It will emphasise Total Technological Support for the SAF, and improve cooperation among the SAF, the Defence Technology Group and our local defence industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Training. The SAF needs competent and well-trained manpower. MINDEF will continue to invest in training, to work out \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> effective systems for operational training, and develop each person to his or her potential. MINDEF has revamped its Basic Military and Specialist training packages, and improved the system for selecting officer cadets and specialists, to identify the best and brightest in every cohort to assume positions of leadership and responsibility. National Servicemen are increasingly better educated. MINDEF will continue to modify their training to take advantage of this trend, and entrust them with more responsibilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>MINDEF and Diplomacy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Singapore needs a stable regional environment to thrive. MINDEF will strengthen its network of bilateral relationships and multilateral arrangements with armed forces in ASEAN and other countries, including countries outside the region. We will continue to carry out joint exercises with friendly armed forces, and participate in multilateral arrangements such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the Five Power Defence Arrangements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Because of the severe shortage of training areas in Singapore, the SAF must increasingly train overseas. MINDEF is constantly looking for overseas training opportunities. It will expand the scope of training in countries where the SAF already has facilities, and explore new arrangements in countries which welcome the SAF. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. MINDEF will help Singapore play its role as a responsible member of the international community. To show support for and commitment to the United Nations, SAF personnel will continue to take part in UN peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. Recently Singapore informed the United Nations that we will be contributing troops and equipment to the UN Standby Arrangements. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>The SAF and Society</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The SAF is not just a defence force, but a premier national institution. It plays a major role in strengthening social cohesion. Through National Service, the SAF imparts values, expertise and skills to every male citizen, which strengthen their bonds to Singapore and thereby contribute to nation-building. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. This is the 30th year of National Service. National Servicemen form the backbone of the SAF. MINDEF will strengthen their commitment to National Service, both in Full-Time and Operationally Ready units, and their motivation to defend our nation. MINDEF has implemented many recommendations of the Second Committee to Recognise the Contribution of Operationally Ready National Servicemen in Total Defence (RECORD II). It will continue to explore more ways to recognise NSmen's contributions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Singaporeans and Defence</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Total Defence is the cornerstone of deterrence against external threats. Total Defence involves and unites all sectors of society in the defence of the nation. MINDEF will continue to stress Total Defence, to bring home to all Singaporeans that responsibility for Singapore's security rests not only on the SAF but on every citizen. All have a part to play in the nation's defence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Mr Wong Kan Seng\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Home Affairs\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Ministry will maintain a safe, secure and socially healthy environment for citizens. The Home Team approach unites all departments and statutory boards with a common vision to achieve world class professionalism. The Home Team will work closely with citizens to ensure their continued safety. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i><b>Public Programmes, Policies and Plans</b></i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. MHA will focus on the following areas: \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Working Closely with the Community</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. The Police will revamp the Neighbourhood Policing system to work more effectively with grassroots organisations, community agencies and neighbourhood groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Emergency Management</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. MHA will develop capabilities to counter new forms of terrorist attacks and to manage industrial accidents involving hazardous materials. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Shelter Programme</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. New shelters will be built in underground stations along the North-East MRT line. Legislation will be introduced to make household shelters compulsory in all new residential developments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Drug Abuse</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. We will combat drug abuse by combining preventive education, enforcement and rehabilitation. We will introduce legislation for long term imprisonment of drug addicts who are caught for the third time, to deter hard-core addiction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. The Central Narcotics Bureau will step up enforcement action and preventive education measures to pre-empt the abuse of psychotropic drugs like Ecstasy and Ice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. The National Council Against Drug Abuse will co-ordinate preventive drug education programmes, which will target high-risk groups. Community and voluntary welfare organisations, schools, parents and MUIS will all be actively involved. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Service Quality</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. Immigration Checkpoint operations at the Airport, Woodlands and Tuas (end 1997) will be upgraded to use the latest information technology. Travel by land to Malaysia will be faster with the new Checkpoints at Tuas and Woodlands. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h. NRICs can be issued on-the-spot. Applications for Birth/Death certificate extracts can be made by post and the Internet. There will be more one-stop services when Singapore Immigration and NRD move to new premises in 1997. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Juvenile Delinquency</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. The Police will work closely with the Ministry of Community Development, schools and voluntary welfare organisations to counter incipient juvenile delinquency. Young offenders will be given a choice between prosecution and 6 months of Guidance and Counselling. School disciplinary masters will be appointed honorary Volunteer Special Constabulary Inspectors or Assistant \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superintendents of Police to bolster their authority to manage problematic students. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j. Prisons and the MCD will pilot a project to electronically tag Reformative Trainees under statutory supervision to test its effectiveness in rehabilitating and reintegrating young offenders into society more quickly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i><b>Development and Management Programme</b></i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To be a professional, operational organisation, delivering top quality service to the public, MHA will: \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Develop New Operations Concepts and Capabilities</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. A major Masterplanning exercise will revamp key operational concepts and processes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Work processes are being streamlined, re-designed or even eliminated to improve productivity and service quality. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. MHA will invest heavily in technology, especially information technology, across the board. The Police's Cubicon (Command, Control and Communication System) project will give the Police, SCDF and CNB new joint operations capabilities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. A new Law Enforcement Academy will combine training for Police, SCDF, CNB, Prisons, Immigration and other law enforcement officers, including the Corrupt Practices Investigations Bureau, Customs, and Auxiliary Police Forces. Centralised training will save resources, build the Home Team culture, and foster camaraderie among law enforcement officers nationwide. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Prof S Jayakumar\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Foreign Affairs\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Singapore is a multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-religious country in Southeast Asia. Our ASEAN partners remain central to our foreign policy. We will strengthen these excellent relations through greater economic co-operation and institutional linkages in ASEAN. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singapore looks forward to the challenges and opportunities of an ASEAN 10 with a community of 500 million people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Relations with our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific, including Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea, are also cordial. We will strive to strengthen them, and to weave these bilateral relationships into a co-operative framework to benefit both the region and Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The continued presence of the United States, and a China that has open and constructive relations with the rest of the world, will make the whole region more stable and predictable. Peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific, and in Southeast Asia in particular, provide conducive conditions to economic growth and prosperity for Singapore and other countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. APEC is an important forum to promote economic development and foster a spirit of community in the Asia-Pacific. Singapore will work with our ASEAN partners to strengthen the ASEAN Regional Forum, and encourage major powers in the region to participate constructively in it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Europe should be fully engaged in the economic dynamism of East Asia. Singapore will help to develop the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) as a forum for economic co-operation, political dialogue, and cultural, scientific and technological exchanges. The Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF), located in Singapore, will be an important catalyst for cultural, intellectual and people-to-people exchanges, and help to develop mutual understanding and awareness between Asians and Europeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Singapore will continue to participate actively in the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation, the Commonwealth, the Group of 77, the Non-Aligned Movement and other international organisations. We will play our part in tackling global issues which affect mankind as a whole. We will contribute to on-going efforts to reform the UN to adapt it to the challenges of a new world order, and participate in UN peacekeeping operations in Africa, Asia, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Latin America and the Middle East. Singapore is bidding for a non-permanent seat in the UN Security Council for a two-year term in 2001-2. If elected, we will play a constructive role in global security matters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Singapore will also continue to share its own experience of development with other countries. We have extended the reach of our technical assistance programme by partnering developed countries like Australia, Canada, Germany, Norway, South Korea and the United States, as well as the Commonwealth Secretariat, the United Nations Development Programme, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and other International Organisations. The Singapore Cooperation Programme and our Third Country Training Programmes now sponsor 2,000 trainees from 60 countries each year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We have diplomatic and consular relations with 151 countries. Through our resident and non-resident Ambassadors and Honorary Consuls, MFA strives to provide quality diplomatic services to advance and safeguard Singapore's interests in an increasingly interdependent world; to promote an appreciation of Singapore's policies and social values; to support Singapore's regionalisation efforts; and to provide better consular services to Singaporeans and visitors. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Mr Yeo Cheow Tong\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for the Environment\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Economic growth and rising affluence will pose new environmental challenges. Singaporeans will demand higher standards of public health and cleanliness, and good air and water quality. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We will put in place a first-rate environmental infrastructure for solid and liquid waste disposal. Environmental protection and public health programmes will keep pollution and infectious diseases in check. Our air and water quality will continue to meet international \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> standards, food will be safe to consume, and sources and modes of transmission of infectious diseases will be kept under control. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. High public health standards require surveillance, enforcement, and education. We need the full cooperation of the public. We will pursue public education programmes to nurture an environmentally conscious population that will help keep Singapore clean. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We have to find new ways to overcome the manpower shortage, such as corporatisation, mechanisation of manual tasks and re-design of walkways and drains to reduce the need for cleansing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. As spelt out in the Singapore Green Plan, the Ministry will implement programmes on environmental education, environmental technology, resource conservation, clean technology, and environmental noise. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Environmental Infrastructure and Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will develop new refuse handling and disposal facilities to cope with the increasing amount of refuse generated. An offshore sanitary landfill at Pulau Semakau will be completed by 1999. A fourth refuse incineration plant will be built, and a fifth planned. We will promote the use of the pneumatic refuse collection system in public housing estates and private developments to improve refuse collection services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Given the high cost of these facilities, we will strongly encourage households and industries to generate less waste. We will also promote recycling and waste minimisation programmes where these make economic sense. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will upgrade the six existing sewage treatment works progressively to cope with increasing wastewater volumes. Concurrently, the sewer reticulation system will be upgraded and extended. We are studying a Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS), a multi-billion dollar programme to provide an efficient system \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for collecting, treating and disposing of wastewater as a long-term solution. This will free up valuable land for other uses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will implement drainage schemes for flood prevention ahead of large-scale land developments. Our waterways will be regularly maintained and improved to enhance their recreational value. We will reconstruct the river-walls of the Singapore River. When the barrage across the mouth of Marina Bay is built, the river will have a pleasant waterfront with a placid waterbody to complement and support our riverside development plans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Environmental Management</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will continue to monitor air and water quality, and environmental noise levels, to protect the quality of our environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will cooperate with countries in the region and the international community to reduce transboundary pollution and protect the global environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Public Health</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will continue our enforcement efforts to encourage Singaporeans to be environmentally responsible. Public education programmes will make Singaporeans more aware of public health issues, and motivate them to refrain from anti-social behaviour. We will pay particular attention to the cleanliness of housing estates and public toilets, and littering. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We will maintain vigilance over the infectious disease situation and other environment-related health problems. In particular, we will strive to reduce the incidence of dengue fever. This means eliminating stagnant water in drains and gutters, research to determine reliable entomological indicators which will provide early warning of impending dengue outbreaks, and licensing Environmental Control Officers to check the environmental health aspects of buildings and construction sites. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. We will sell more hawker stalls at a discount to stallholders, so that they can own assets and take a stake in the country. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF INFORMATION AND THE ARTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   BG George Yong-Boon Yeo\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Information and The Arts\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. MITA will continue to help make Singapore a renaissance city for information, culture and the arts in the 21st century. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b><i>Information</i></b> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Broadcasting</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The broadcasting industry is expanding rapidly. New technologies challenge us to find new ways to manage and exploit them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The former SBC was corporatised as TCS and TV12 in 1994. Quality of programming has improved. TV12 was restructured and Prime 12 and Premiere 12 were launched in September 1995. We will start a new arts radio station this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Cable TV was introduced in Tampines in June 1995. By 1999, the whole island will be cabled up. Singaporeans can then subscribe to a wide range of cable TV programmes, and enjoy access to interactive services and high speed Internet. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Internet is growing explosively as a universal facility for mass communication. We will continue to promote the responsible use of the Internet as an exciting medium for information, education, entertainment and commercial applications. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Media Hub</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Singapore is becoming a Media Hub. Financial information services have grown to service expanding Asian markets. International media organisations like Reuters have set up regional offices, uplinking and production facilities here. We welcome them, and will continue to facilitate their operations in the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Library</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Every Singaporean will have a library within easy reach. The National Library Board (NLB) will implement a $1 billion programme to make public libraries more convenient and accessible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Eventually we will have 4 regional libraries, 18 community libraries and 84 neighbourhood children's libraries all over Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. NLB has introduced online services including catalogue searches and loans. Next, NLB will link its libraries electronically with other major libraries in Singapore and elsewhere. Singaporeans will have fast and easy access to library resources worldwide. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b><i>Culture and The Arts</i></b> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>The Arts<br><br></i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will make the arts more accessible to Singaporeans of all ages. The National Arts Council (NAC) has launched the \"Concerts in the Park\" series. NAC will extend the Arts Education Programme to all schools, and work with arts groups and mass organisations to hold more art events in community centres, libraries and HDB town centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The first two auditoriums at The Esplanade -Theatres on the Bay will be completed in the year 2001. They will provide much needed performing space for quality productions and help Singapore become a regional centre for the arts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. From 1999, the Festival of Arts, now held every other year, will become an annual event, absorbing the Festival of Asian Performing Arts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will help the Singapore Chinese Orchestra (SCO) develop into a professional orchestra of high standards. SCO's home will be the Singapore Conference Hall, when renovations are completed by 1999. We will continue to assist the Singapore Symphony Orchestra and help it prepare for the opening of The Esplanade. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We will help to develop the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and LaSalle-SIA College into premier arts institutions with their own characters and traditions. They will conduct tertiary level courses and give artistic young Singaporeans opportunities to realise their potential. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. We will promote community singing, especially of Singapore songs. We will gradually build up a repertoire of Singapore songs and popularise them on radio and television. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Heritage</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. The first wing of the Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM) at the old Tao Nan School was officially opened on 21st April this year. The larger second wing of ACM at the Empress Place Building will be ready in 1999. ACM will showcase the major Asian civilisations which are part of our diverse heritage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. We will continue to bring in exhibitions from all over the world while building up our own collections. ACM at old Tao Nan opened with displays on Chinese civilisation and a Ramayana exhibition. The Singapore Art Museum will hold a Leonardo da Vinci exhibition this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. We will continue to promote knowledge of Singapore history. The National Heritage Board (NHB) will organise travelling exhibitions to schools and community centres. The National Museum Building at Stamford Road will be renovated to house the Singapore History Museum. NHB will also set up a small museum at the old Bukit Timah Ford Factory. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b><i>SINGAPORE KINDNESS MOVEMENT</i></b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. MITA supports the establishment of the Singapore Kindness Movement as a civic movement. Its aim is to inspire Singaporeans from all walks of life to perform acts of kindness, small and not-so-small, in their daily lives. In March, the movement was opened to all secondary one and two students. Other groups will be progressively brought in. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF LABOUR</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Dr Lee Boon Yang\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Labour\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. MOL will, in partnership with workers and employers, foster an efficient and fair labour market and a safe and harmonious work environment, to achieve growth and prosperity for Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Economic Competitiveness</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We must remain competitive in the world market for our workers to enjoy job security, sustainable wage increases and better standard of living. We will work closely with employers and trade unions to formulate sound employment and wage policies, and build a business-friendly environment to attract investments and create more jobs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We must refine our wage system to better reflect the value of the job, and to link performance and rewards more closely. We will promote employer medical benefits schemes which encourage greater individual responsibility for a healthy lifestyle and health care, and thus keep health costs low. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Industrial Relations Climate</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. A harmonious industrial relations climate has been one of our strongest attractions to investors. We will maintain this through tripartite cooperation. We will keep labour laws relevant to the needs of both employers and workers. We will provide a comprehensive and effective conciliation service which balances the interests of both, and resolves issues before they become conflicts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Manpower resources</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Our rapidly ageing population will cause serious economic and social problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Singaporeans must work longer, in order to continue earning regular income and accumulate more savings for their eventual retirement. We will extend the retirement age beyond 60, and simultaneously address structural problems in our wage system which make it difficult for employers to keep our older workers. We will ensure that older workers get a fair deal, but basic changes to the wage structure beyond 60 are unavoidable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will encourage more housewives to work by promoting part-time and flexible work arrangements, which help them balance work and household responsibilities. We will explore ways to train this group of potential workers to help them re-enter the workforce. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Economic upgrading and higher wages means restructuring of companies and industries, and inevitably some retrenchments and redundancies. We will help to retrain retrenched workers, so that they can find new jobs as soon as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Foreign Worker Policy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will always need foreign workers to supplement the domestic workforce. We will maintain a controlled and revolving pool of foreign workers, but we should not become over dependent on them. We will encourage employers to use technology to save manpower, and to recruit more skilled and productive foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will continue to simplify work permit rules and procedures. We will also upgrade the professionalism of employment agencies to provide better service to both employers and foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Industrial Health and Safety</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Workplace accidents are preventable. All workers are entitled to a safe and healthy workplace. We will actively enforce safety and health regulations. Industries and companies which persistently disregard safety rules or have poor safety records will receive special attention. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will update the standards and practice of critical aspects of industrial health and safety. We will promote permit-to-work, safety audit and safety management systems to help employers plan, assess, review, implement and monitor safe work practices, especially in hazardous industries like construction and petro-chemicals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Maintaining health and safety at work requires the combined effort of employers and workers. We need to train and educate all levels of the workforce, workers, supervisors and middle managers, and top management. We will work with vocational and tertiary institutions to introduce students to occupational safety and health, and encourage them to adopt safe work practices as a way of life. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Social Security \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Singaporeans must plan and save for their retirement. The CPF will continue to be the basic saving plan for all employees. The Minimum Sum Scheme ensures that each CPF member sets aside enough savings to meet his basic needs when he eventually retires. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. We have progressively relaxed the restrictions on how CPF members can invest their CPF funds. The consolidation of the Basic and the Enhanced Investment Schemes on 1st January 1997 is but the latest step. CPF members have generally invested prudently. We will continue to widen the scope for CPF members to invest their savings and obtain higher returns, so long as they preserve a minimum amount for old-age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. We will also encourage CPF members to provide greater financial protection for themselves and their families, for example, by buying annuities with their Minimum Sum savings and health insurance like MediShield or MediShield Plus with their Medisave. We will also encourage more self-employed to save beyond what is in their Medisave for their old-age needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Mr Lim Hng Kiang\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for National Development\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. We will continue to enhance Singapore's physical infra structure and environment, to make this a thriving, vibrant metropolis and a gracious, comfortable home. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Planning and Developing a City of Excellence</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. We will develop Singapore into a city comparable to the best in the world. We will review our Concept Plan to incorporate the best features of other cities. The Plan will form the blueprint for our development in the new century. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To support our economy, we will set aside enough land for commerce, industry and infrastructure. We will encourage offices and high-tech industries to set up in regional centres and the fringes of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> towns, to bring jobs closer to homes. HDB will re-develop its industrial properties to use the land more effectively and enable the businesses to modernise. We will also continue to build the infrastructure we need to strengthen our hub status. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will start developing the new downtown in Marina South this year. It will be an exciting and beautiful city hub served by efficient public transport. Pedestrians will be able to move about unimpeded by car traffic in all weather comfort. We will also upgrade the physical environment of the existing CBD to the same standard as our new downtown. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will develop Marina Bay and the Singapore River. A barrage at the Marina Channel will stabilise the water level in Marina Bay, Kallang Basin and Singapore River. This will create a serene and pleasant water body for boating and water leisure activities, and enhance the value of waterside properties. Distinctive landmark buildings will mark prominent sites, and a continuous tree-lined pedestrian mall will let Singaporeans and tourists enjoy the new skyline around the Bay. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will complete environmental improvements to the Singapore River by the Year 2000. The river will become a scenic waterway, with riverside promenades for dining, shopping and entertainment. Restored shophouses and warehouses will provide a sense of history and a refreshing contrast to our modern cityscape. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will create a bright lights entertainment area in the city. More street life and activities will be introduced to the three historic districts of Chinatown, Kampong Glam and Little India. The Civic District will have elegant lighting and pleasant walkways. These will enliven our urban environment, and promote our architectural heritage and cultural identity. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Building the Best Home for Singaporeans</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. To create a better living environment for Singaporeans, we will work to realise the visions set out in Punggol 21 and Pasir Ris 21, and extend the ideas to other towns. These new or redeveloped towns will have well-integrated transport \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> systems, a pedestrian-friendly layout, and an interesting variety of recreational facilities. Schools, parks and sports complexes will be clustered together to share amenities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Under the Estate Renewal Strategy (ERS), we will progressively redevelop and upgrade the older HDB estates, to keep their living environment comparable with the newer estates. Home owners can enjoy a higher standard of housing without leaving their existing neighbourhoods. This will help preserve community ties. The ERS in Toa Payoh is in full swing while those for Ang Mo Kio and Bedok have been launched. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The Main and Interim Upgrading Programmes will improve the quality of life of HDB households, and enhance the value of their flats. By 2002, half of the older HDB precincts will be upgraded either under the MUP or IUP. Suitable precincts will also be redeveloped under the Selective En-bloc Redevelopment Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will review our home ownership schemes: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. To help younger Singaporeans own flats and set up families earlier, these first-time applicants will receive higher priority in the allocation of new HDB flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Many Singaporeans aspire to upgrade to bigger HDB flats. We will review the queue system to allocate new flats to upgraders more equitably. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. We will help the home-owning elderly realise the capital value of their assets. We will study building small apartments with high quality interior finishes in the newer HDB estates, which the elderly can move into to live nearer their children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. We will continue to assist low-income families to own their homes. HDB will buy back more 3-room flats from the open market, to sell at a discount to these families. Rental flats will also be offered for sale to eligible existing tenants of HDB at subsidised rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Our priority must continue to be applicants with the proper family nucleus. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some singles do face difficulty in owning homes. We will study how to help them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. We will continue to release land for Executive Condominiums and private housing to meet rising aspirations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. We will also study ways to enhance the surroundings of private residential estates, for example with better public amenities like children's playgrounds, street lighting and walkways. This will improve the estate ambience and raise the value of the homes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. We will continue to ensure that our buildings are safe and of good quality, by improving the building regulatory process, promoting modern construction technology, and training a more productive and skilled construction workforce. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Enhancing the Quality of Life</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. We will develop Changi Village into a tropical resort with hotels, apartments, waterfront restaurants, recreation clubs, cycle tracks and seaside promenades. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. Singapore will be a home within a garden. Through better planning and design, we will bring parks and green spaces to the doorsteps of our homes and work places. Existing parks will be rejuvenated and interesting new thematic parks and gardens developed. These parks will be linked up through park connectors, to create a matrix of greenery and offer a relief from our urban environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Mr Mah Bow Tan\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Communications\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional boom will fuel growth in the communications sector for our seaport, airport and telecommunications services. On land transport, we will continue to upgrade our road and rail network. As our neighbours in the region advance, we must continue to keep our communications infrastructure effective and efficient to stay competitive. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Telecommunications</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore relies on its excellent telecommunications network to be an attractive business hub. We currently provide a wide range of innovative and reliable services at very competitive prices. But telecommunications technology is advancing rapidly. Regulatory barriers are crumbling. WTO has just concluded a new agreement to liberalise basic telecommunications world-wide. Innovative services are revolutionising telecommunications markets. The Internet and satellite communications are rendering old distinctions and restrictions obsolete. We must not be left behind. \n  <br>\n  <br>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have cut short the period of exclusive licences for Singapore Telecom. We will have competition in mobile communications from this year. TAS will call tenders for new operators for our public basic telecommunications services, including IDD services, this year. Up to two new mobile cellular telephone operators will be licensed in the middle of next year, to provide service from the year 2000. \n  <br>\n  <br>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are rolling out Singapore ONE, an interactive multimedia broadband network. This will provide high speed interactive access from homes and businesses. It could be the start of a new way of accessing and transacting information for business, entertainment and knowledge upgrading. \n  <br>\n  <br>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to develop our telecommunications infrastructure and grow the industry, bringing in new players and introducing value-added services aggressively. This will strengthen Singapore's position as a business hub, and make available the best telecommunications services to Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Air Transport</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air travel will increase as the region booms. We will expand our airport capacity to cater for the increase in air travel. 24.5 million passengers used Changi Airport in 1996. This will increase year by year. Our two passenger terminals at Changi Airport are being expanded. We will build Passenger Terminal 3 to be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> ready by 2004. The MRT extension will reach Changi Airport by 2001. Land for a third runway is being reclaimed. \n  <br>\n  <br>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional countries are building newer and bigger airports to gain market share of the growing traffic. To stay competitive, we will not only upgrade our physical airport infrastructure, but also the quality of service of the airport staff. Changi must remain the best airport in the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to expand Changi Airport's connections with the rest of the world, linking up to new destinations and increasing service frequencies to support Singapore's growing economic links. Visits to and from Singapore for business and leisure will become even more convenient. We have signed an Open Skies agreement with the US. We seek similarly to expand our air services agreements with major trading partners and emerging economies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Sea Transport</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will build on our excellent port services to keep Singa pore an international maritime centre. But competition in the port business is getting fiercer. Major shipping lines are forming large consortia to bargain for favourable terms from port operators. A few hub ports will cover the whole world, each fed by many feeder ports. We must consolidate and enhance our position as a hub port for the whole region, or else become a feeder. \n  <br>\n  <br>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Pasir Panjang Terminal will cater to growth in container traffic. Phase I will be completed in 1998. Hong Kong is still ahead of Singapore in terms of number of container movements, but we have narrowed the gap with Hong Kong. \n  <br>\n  <br>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will corporatise PSA. Then it can respond more aggressively to new business opportunities and changing market trends, and compete more effectively internationally. PSA has invested in port projects in Dalian and Fuzhou, China, as well as Cigading, Indonesia. It will seek more overseas alliances and investment opportunities to complement its operations in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Land Transport</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to work towards a world class land transport system, by better land use and transport planning, expanding the road network, managing the population and usage of vehicles and demand for road space, and improving public transport. \n  <br>\n  <br>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will integrate transport facilities with building developments to make it easier for commuters to get to key places of work, living, leisure and other social activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will expand our road network, and maximise its capacity by upgrading and installing intelligent traffic management systems. We will continue to manage the vehicle population through the COE scheme. To manage vehicle usage, we will extend road pricing to expressways and ring roads, and automate the scheme through the Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system. The better we manage vehicle usage, the more COEs we can release and still keep traffic flowing smoothly, and the more people will be able to own cars. \n  <br>\n  <br>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In urbanised Singapore, most trips will always be by public transport. The public transport system will be accessible, safe, speedy and affordable. The North-East MRT line will be completed by 2002. The Bukit Panjang LRT will be completed in 1999. More LRT lines will be built in new towns like Sengkang. We will progressively free up controls on other public transport modes like taxis and buses, to enable new schemes like Bus-Plus, Express Bus and premium taxi services to take off and meet the varied needs and rising expectations of commuters. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Finance\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i><b>Fiscal Policy</b></i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Fiscal policy will continue to support sustained economic growth. The aim is to strengthen the dynamism of our economy and maintain our international competitiveness. This will underpin Government's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> efforts to help Singaporeans generate wealth and share in the success of the nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Operating and development expenditures of Government will be kept in line with operating revenues, achieving a modest budget surplus over the medium term. The size of the public sector will be contained to free resources for the private sector to generate economic growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Government expenditures will be directed to areas which support growth, enhance quality of life and strengthen social cohesion and community bonding. These include education, healthcare, security, public housing and measures to preserve and protect the environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Management reform of the public sector will continue to achieve a leaner, more responsive and effective public sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Our tax structure is broad-based and equitable. We will continue to tax factors of production as lightly as possible to encourage effort and enterprise. The tax system will encourage Singaporeans to work, save, invest, and to build up their assets. As long as we keep expenditures in check, there should be no reason for any major tax increases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will keep our corporate income tax rate internationally competitive. We will use fiscal incentives to encourage investments in Singapore, to promote selected sectors with high growth potential, and to help Singapore companies to expand overseas. We will also widen our network of double taxation agreements and improving existing ones. This will help our regionalisation drive. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i><b>Monetary Policy</b></i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Our monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to be geared towards price stability and non-inflationary economic growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Singapore as a Financial Centre</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will develop Singapore as a leading international financial and business centre in East Asia. Singapore is the home of the Asian dollar market. We \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will widen the range of financial services available. These currently include the stock and financial futures exchanges, foreign exchange, fund management and other capital market activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will maintain a conducive fiscal and regulatory environment, and stimulate development of new activities with appropriate fiscal incentives, and keep business costs low. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. The soundness of our financial system has been Singapore's hallmark as a financial and business centre. We will uphold the integrity and high standards of our corporate environment, and supervise our banks, financial institutions and other corporations vigilantly. At the same time, we will review rules and regulations to ensure that they do not stifle innovation or impede enterprise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. As international financial markets become increasingly globalised, individual financial centres are facing new systemic risks from closer linkages with other financial centres. We will cooperate more closely with other international regulators to minimise such risks to world financial markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i><b>Privatisation and Asset Enhancement programme</b></i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. The Government will continue to privatise and list suitable statutory boards and Government-owned companies on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Shares in such companies will be offered to Singaporeans at a discount as part of Government's share ownership and asset enhancement programme. This will help Singaporeans build up their assets and give them a bigger stake in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF LAW</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Prof. S Jayakumar\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Law\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Legal Branch</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Ministry of Law and Attorney-General's Chambers will continue to enhance the legal infrastructure of Singapore as a foundation of our social and economic progress. We will promote \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more awareness of applicable legal principles in public administration, and improve the quality and efficiency of legal services for the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Our laws and legal system will continue to reflect the values, traditions and aspirations of our community. Substantive laws must continue to address particular Singaporean needs and problems. We will improve mechanisms for resolving social and community conflicts through mediation and other non-court-based systems. We will uphold and strengthen our justice system to protect our citizens. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We will make publicly available the Electronic Database of Statutes and Subsidiary Legislation currently being developed by the Attorney-General's Chambers. We will draft legislation in plain English to make them more easily understood. We will use information technology to ensure more comprehensive legal research, better documentation, and quicker response to requests for legal advice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. We will set up databases of precedents of legal opinions, strengthen links with legal agencies in other countries, and emphasise the training of legal service officers. We will conduct courses in Constitutional and Administrative Law for senior civil servants. We will ensure that the public service implements policies fairly and firmly in accordance with the laws, and regularly update legislation to keep pace with changing social and economic circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. We will work for greater harmonisation of areas of laws with ASEAN and other countries, where we have common interests, such as trade, investment, commerce, banking, shipping and intellectual property. In the ASEAN Free Trade Area, we will work to harmonise custom regulations governing codes, procedures and valuation. These will benefit our businessmen and help foreign investors. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Land Branch</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We will work closely with planning and economic agencies to safeguard the value of state land, and allocate it efficiently and optimally to end-users. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will update our policies and practices on land allocation, alienation and pricing to keep them relevant, clear and consistent, to meet economic changes and maintain our competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Because land is scarce, we must manage state land and buildings earmarked for interim uses carefully, to maximise returns and preserve planning flexibility. The Land Data Hub will become a central depository of digitised land data. We will use faster, higher band-width Wide Area Networks to build up the Hub into a Land Information Network infrastructure linking all land data, including geographic, cadestral, buildings, roads, drainage, sewerage, utilities and housing data, for sharing and planning across the entire public sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. We will share non-confidential land data with the private sector to enable them to produce innovative products and services, including digitised street directories on CD-ROM, interactive kiosks, in-vehicle digitised road maps, and remote access of integrated graphic and textual information on housing plans and lots. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will also review the Land Titles (Strata) Act in consultation with the relevant agencies and the private sector, to improve the management and administration of strata developments. This will benefit the increasing numbers of Singaporeans who live in strata title housing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Mr Lee Yock Suan\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   Minister for Trade and Industry\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Singapore economy grew strongly by an average of 8.6 per cent per annum in the last 5 years, from 1992 to 1996. For the next decade, we can expect growth to remain robust, between 5 and 7 per cent per annum. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To have resources to implement Singapore 21, we must keep our economy vibrant and resilient. The region will remain the fastest-growing in the world. We must continually upgrade ourselves to stay competitive and relevant to the global \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> economy, and make Singapore a launching pad for our companies and people to venture into the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Education, Training &amp; Productivity</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We must emphasise education and training to raise the quality of Singapore workers. We will create more engineering, science and technical places in universities, polytechnics and technical institutes, to support skill-intensive manufacturing industries and R&amp;D activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. As the economy upgrades, old jobs are lost, and new ones created. We will retrain older workers and help them to acquire new skills, through schemes like the Back-to-Work programme and the Training Voucher Scheme. We aim to train 500,000 workers by the year 2005 through on-the-job programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Raising productivity is the key to sustaining competitiveness. Our skills upgrading and training programmes have helped raise productivity levels over the years. The Productivity and Standards Board (PSB) will continue to develop programmes to help companies reach world-class standards in quality management, best practices and business excellence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Science and Technology</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. We must build up science and technology, and deepen our indigenous capabilities. The National Science and Technology Board (NSTB) will lead this co-ordinated effort, involving the private sector, universities and research institutes. We will encourage more bright students to take up science and engineering courses and pursue careers in R&amp;D. We will also attract foreign research talent to work and live in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Developing Local Enterprises</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. We will help promising local enterprises to ride on the regional boom and grow into regional MNCs. The Economic Development Board (EDB) will help them to source manpower, capital and technology, and to gain market access. PSB \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will help the smaller companies to upgrade through various assistance programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Infrastructural Development</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. We will continue to upgrade our business infrastructure to support an efficient modern economy. We will supply enough industrial land at affordable prices, to meet the long term needs of MNC and local manufacturers, and keep manufacturing a key pillar of our economy. We will intensify use of industrial land, through innovative designs and estate renewal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The Public Utilities Board (PUB) will meet our power and water needs efficiently and effectively. It will develop a competitive market for the electricity industry. It will expand and upgrade our water production and distribution capacities, and build a pilot desalination plant. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Singapore as a Total Business Hub</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. We will continue to attract investment in high value-added manufacturing and service industries by MNCs and local enterprises. The Trade Development Board will nurture local companies with the potential to be mega-traders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. We will promote tourism and tourism-related investments. STPB will work with the industry to develop new thematic attractions, upgrade the local industry, and promote overseas companies to use Singapore as a regional HQ. A mega exhibition centre, to be completed in 1999, will strengthen our status as a top convention and exhibition city in Asia. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>International Economic Fora</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Singapore has been an outspoken champion of global free trade. We have benefited from it, and our future depends on it. We will continue to build upon our existing economic linkages in WTO, ASEAN, APEC and ASEM to advance global and regional free trade. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Regionalisation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Regionalisation has strengthened our ties with our neighbours and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> expanded our economic space. Our flagship projects in Indonesia, China, India and Vietnam are progressing well. The Growth Triangle of Singapore, Johor and Riau province has taken off. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Singapore businessmen have responded enthusiastically to the regionalisation drive. The Government will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> continue to help them by building linkages and opening doors to regional economies. We will promote third-country partnerships and joint-ventures to leverage on the partners' complementary strengths. Where it is helpful, we will form Government-to-Government committees and business groups to facilitate these efforts.   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
