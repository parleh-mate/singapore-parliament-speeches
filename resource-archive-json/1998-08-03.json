The public rate was raised from\r\n\r\n3.58%  to 4.39% in line with the upward revision of CPF interest\r\n\r\nrate.   The  market rate was also increased by 1%  from  between\r\n\r\n5.25% and 5.75%, to between 6.25% and 6.75%.  While the interest\r\n\r\nrate   adjustments   affected  some  440,000   households   with\r\n\r\noutstanding  mortgage loans, the increase in  the  monthly  loan\r\n\r\ninstalment was $40 or less for 60% of the households.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has in place various financial assistance measures to\r\n\r\nhelp  lessees  who have difficulties in servicing their  monthly\r\n\r\nmortgage loan instalments.  These measures are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Allow lessee to pay the mortgage loan arrears by\r\n\r\ninstalments within a reasonable period;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Allow lessee to reschedule the mortgage loan repayment\r\n\r\nperiod up to the maximum repayment period that they are eligible\r\n\r\nfor;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Allow lessee to defer payment of loan instalments for\r\n\r\nan  initial period of six months.  The deferment may be extended\r\n\r\nfor another six months, if necessary;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Allow lessee to convert the loan scheme to an easy\r\n\r\nrepayment scheme.  Under this scheme, the monthly instalment for\r\n\r\nthe  first  five  years  is set at 75%  of  the  normal  monthly\r\n\r\ninstalment.  The monthly instalment will then be recomputed from\r\n\r\nthe sixth year to the end\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  repayment period based on the outstanding loan  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of the sixth year; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Advise lessee to include a working family member as a joint\r\n\r\nowner if the latter meets the eligibility conditions.  This will\r\n\r\nenable the family to use the CPF monies of the new lessee to pay\r\n\r\nfor the arrears.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether the HDB will levy any administrative charge for\r\n\r\nthose who need to restructure their loans?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> If the loans are rescheduled, then the\r\n\r\nwhole loan is recomputed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of\r\n\r\nthe  prevailing  difficult economic situation,  may  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  if  he  would  ask the HDB to consider  deferring  the\r\n\r\ncollection  of the principal element in the payment and  require\r\n\r\nthe  house  owner to only pay for the interest element,  in  the\r\n\r\ncase of families facing financial hardship?  In other words,  of\r\n\r\nall  the  alternatives that the Minister has proposed just  now,\r\n\r\ncan I ask that this alternative be also considered?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The five measures which I outlined\r\n\r\nearlier  have been very effective.  Very few HDB mortgage  cases\r\n\r\nrequire  us to repossess the flats.  As of today, the percentage\r\n\r\nof  arrears  of  mortgage loan instalments  has  increased  only\r\n\r\nslightly from 1.9% in May to 2.1% in June.  So the situation  is\r\n\r\nstill  very  much  under control and HDB takes  a  very  helpful\r\n\r\napproach to the mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  may  I  ask the Minister that if, in spite  of  all  these\r\n\r\nschemes  that the HDB has, the flat owner is unable to meet  his\r\n\r\npayments, how much time does the HDB allow before it decides  to\r\n\r\nrepossess  the apartment under the powers given in  the  Housing\r\n\r\nand Development Act?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Under one of the schemes which I have\r\n\r\noutlined earlier,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  first give them an initial period of six months and then, if\r\n\r\nthey  still face difficulties, we give them a further period  of\r\n\r\nsix months.  And we work very actively with them to see how they\r\n\r\ncould  reschedule  the  loans, how they  can  make  use  of  the\r\n\r\nballooning  scheme,  how  they  can  include  additional  family\r\n\r\nmembers  to help pay for the loan.  So our experience,  both  in\r\n\r\nthe  1985/1986  recession, as well as all these years,  is  that\r\n\r\nservicing the mortgage loans for HDB flat is never really a  big\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister said that very few apartments\r\n\r\nhave  been  repossessed.

But if\r\n\r\nmy memory serves me, probably five or seven last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Further to the\r\n\r\nquestion  by  Mr Jeyaretnam, would the Minister tell  the  House\r\n\r\nwhat is the percentage of increase compared to last year?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I said earlier, the percentage of\r\n\r\nloan arrears has gone up by a very small percentage compared  to\r\n\r\nnearly  half  a million mortgage loans that we administer.   HDB\r\n\r\ntakes  a  very  positive and helpful attitude towards  all  home\r\n\r\nowners.   It is our objective to let them keep their  flat,  own\r\n\r\ntheir  flat,  and we try our best to help each case  that  comes\r\n\r\nbefore us to reschedule and to make the payments, to stretch  it\r\n\r\nover  a longer time.  The number of cases where we actually take\r\n\r\nback the flats is very few.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask the Minister, if a flat owner is willing to downgrade, would\r\n\r\nthe HDB help him?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> This is part of the various measures\r\n\r\nwhich  HDB  has.   If a family has over-extended  themselves  by\r\n\r\nbuying  a  bigger flat than they could really afford, especially\r\n\r\nwith  this  economic downturn, and it is quite clear  that  they\r\n\r\ncannot continue to service the loan, HDB would help them to sell\r\n\r\noff  their flat if they are eligible to sell it off, and  buy  a\r\n\r\nsmaller flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, eviction notices are\r\n\r\nfearful  messages  to receive, especially to  a  person  who  is\r\n\r\nalready  down  in the dumps, enveloped by a sense of  gloom  and\r\n\r\nhelplessness.   Will  the Minister ask  the  HDB  to  thoroughly\r\n\r\ninvestigate  each  case  to assess its  merits  before  eviction\r\n\r\nnotices  are  issued?   Now is the time when  understanding  and\r\n\r\ncompassion  are  appropriate.   Households  will  be   extremely\r\n\r\ngrateful  to  the Board for their support to help them  overcome\r\n\r\ntheir  difficulties.

This  programme is designed  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nemployability of the local workforce by encouraging employers to\r\n\r\nsend their workers for skills upgrading and retraining.  The aim\r\n\r\nis  to  equip the under-educated and lower-skilled workers  with\r\n\r\ncertifiable  skills to enable them to remain employable  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 4,176 workers who have so far benefited from the\r\n\r\nprogramme,  70% have Secondary Two education or  less.   46%  of\r\n\r\nthese  workers are above the age of 40, with another 39% between\r\n\r\nthe ages of 30 and 39.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 80% of the employees who have benefited from the\r\n\r\nSkills   Redevelopment  Programme  are  from  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector,  as this was the first to be adversely affected  by  the\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn.   About  70% of  the  SRP  participants  are\r\n\r\nfemales,  since  there  are  more  women  in  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A requirement of the Skills Redevelopment Programme is that\r\n\r\nthe  courses offered must lead to national certification.   This\r\n\r\nprotects  the  worker and ensures recognition of skills  by  the\r\n\r\nemployer.   The  types  of courses offered  include  preparatory\r\n\r\ncourses   such   as  language  and  numeracy,   Certificate   of\r\n\r\nCompetency, National Technical Certificates (NTC) levels  2  and\r\n\r\n3, and other certificate courses offered by the polytechnics and\r\n\r\nthe  ITE.  These skills are required by jobs in various sectors,\r\n\r\nincluding manufacturing and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current estimate of benefits granted is about $16.7\r\n\r\nmillion, or about $4,000 per worker.  This is based on a funding\r\n\r\nmechanism that subsidises up to 80% of the course fees,  and  up\r\n\r\nto 70% of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworker's  absentee payroll.

The other concern\r\n\r\nwas  of  course whether employers will support such a programme.\r\n\r\nAs  the  economic  crisis  unfolds and as  workers  become  more\r\n\r\nconcerned  and worried about job security, we found  a  matching\r\n\r\nincrease  in interest to undergo retraining and skills upgrading\r\n\r\nby   the   workers  themselves.   So  we  find   that   workers,\r\n\r\nparticularly those who are low-skilled and with lower education,\r\n\r\nas  can  be seen from the figures that I gave earlier  on,  were\r\n\r\nvery   amenable  to  undergo  retraining  and  skills  upgrading\r\n\r\ncourses.

The  complete investigation of  the  ValueJet  DC-9\r\n\r\naccident in Florida, USA in May 1996 took 16 months.  The  China\r\n\r\nAirlines  A300  incident in Nagoya, Japan  in  April  1994  took\r\n\r\nalmost 27 months.  Others took even longer.  In the case of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Airlines B737 crash in Colorado Springs, USA,  in  March\r\n\r\n1991, seven years ago, investigation is still on-going.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the SilkAir case, the investigation is made difficult by\r\n\r\nthe extent of damage of the aircraft and the lack of useful data\r\n\r\nfrom the black boxes.  At this point in time, the team is unable\r\n\r\nto  predict  when  investigations into  the  accident  would  be\r\n\r\ncompleted.  They have, however, informed me that it is  unlikely\r\n\r\nto  be  completed within the next six months.

This is a small\r\n\r\nproportion of more than 100,000 foreign domestic workers who are\r\n\r\ncurrently  working in Singapore.  Most of the  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers  had run away from their employers' homes.   There  were\r\n\r\nvery  few reports of foreign domestic workers running away while\r\n\r\nunder the care of the employment agents.  As such, I do not have\r\n\r\nthe number of such cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employers whose foreign domestic workers have absconded\r\n\r\nare  given one month from the date of cancellation of  the  work\r\n\r\npermit  to  locate and repatriate the worker, failing which  the\r\n\r\nsecurity deposit will be forfeited.  However, we allow employers\r\n\r\nup to six months to locate or help to locate the missing workers\r\n\r\nand a refund of the forfeited money will be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of foreign domestic workers going missing while\r\n\r\nin  the  care of the employment agencies, I would like to remind\r\n\r\nemployers  that they are ultimately responsible for  the  worker\r\n\r\nthe  day  she  comes into Singapore.  The employer cannot  shift\r\n\r\nthis responsibility to an employment agent.  It is therefore not\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  amend the legislation to hold  employment  agents\r\n\r\nliable  for  foreign domestic workers who go  missing  while  in\r\n\r\ntheir care.  However, my Ministry will consider such factors  in\r\n\r\nappeals by employers for refund of the security deposits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister of\r\n\r\nState to reconsider the request.  When an employer applies for a\r\n\r\nmaid through an agency, the agency basically brings the maid  in\r\n\r\nfrom  whatever  country and they make an  arrangement  with  the\r\n\r\nemployer  and  assures the employer that  if  the  maid  is  not\r\n\r\nsatisfactory,  the  employer can  send  the  maid  back  to  the\r\n\r\nemployment agency and some arrangement will be made  to  send  a\r\n\r\nnew  maid to the employer.  Under these circumstances,  I  think\r\n\r\nthere is an understanding between the employer and the agency to\r\n\r\nsend  the maid back to the agency if she is unsatisfactory.   If\r\n\r\nthis  is  the case, is it not right for the maid agency to  take\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for the security of the maid  while  she  is  in\r\n\r\ntheir  custody?  And if the maid were to go missing during  this\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time, does the Ministry not consider it  appropriate\r\n\r\nthat the responsibility should lie with the agency?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, are you making a speech?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> I am sorry. I just want to say this. Will\r\n\r\nthe Ministry reconsider its decision?  The Ministry can help  in\r\n\r\nresolving the issue of helplessness of the employer?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, I have mentioned that the\r\n\r\nemployer  is ultimately responsible for the worker the  day  she\r\n\r\ncomes  into  Singapore.  He employs the worker and therefore  he\r\n\r\nshould  be  responsible for the worker.  However, we  will  take\r\n\r\nthis  into consideration when appeals are made by employers  for\r\n\r\nrefund  of  security deposits when the maid goes  missing  under\r\n\r\nthese  circumstances.  But I repeat again that the  employer  is\r\n\r\nresponsible for the worker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, the employer applies for transfers. While\r\n\r\nthey  wait  for  the transfer, the foreign domestic  worker  can\r\n\r\nstill be under the care of the employer.  So the employer should\r\n\r\nbe responsible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  whether  it  is  fair for the  employer  to  be  held\r\n\r\nresponsible  when the maid is in the custody of  the  employment\r\n\r\nagency.  The agency would say, \"Yes, I will take back\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  maid  and find you a new one.\"  In this case, the  employer\r\n\r\nwould  say to the maid agency, \"I have already passed back  this\r\n\r\nmaid  to  you and she is under your custody.\"  In this instance,\r\n\r\nwould the Ministry consider passing legislation to hold the maid\r\n\r\nagency  responsible?   Because  to  say  that  the  employer  is\r\n\r\nresponsible,  I think it is not fair.  The indifference  of  the\r\n\r\nmaid agency could really frustrate the employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, as I have mentioned, the\r\n\r\nemployer  brings  the  maid  into Singapore  and  he  should  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the maid.  When the maid is given back  to  the\r\n\r\nemployment agency while they wait for certain things to be done,\r\n\r\nI  think  the  employer must recognise that  he  still  has  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  the  maid.  The employer  can  come  to  an\r\n\r\narrangement  with  the employment agency.   That  is  a  private\r\n\r\narrangement.   But  when  the  employer  brings  the  maid  into\r\n\r\nSingapore, our position is that he should be responsible for the\r\n\r\nmaid.  And if the maid goes missing, then he has to abide by the\r\n\r\nterms of the security deposit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INTRODUCTION OF EURO CURRENCY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Impact on Singapore economy)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry whether the introduction of a single Euro currency  and\r\n\r\nthe  eventual formation of a single market in Europe  will  have\r\n\r\nany  implications  for,  and  impact,  direct  or  indirect,  on\r\n\r\ninvestments,  trade  flows  and  inflation  for  the   Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  European Union is a significant  trade  and\r\n\r\ninvestment partner for Singapore.  As a bloc, it was  our  third\r\n\r\nlargest  export  market last year, accounting  for  14%  of  our\r\n\r\nexports.   It  was  the second largest investor  into  Singapore\r\n\r\n(accounting  for about 20 % of our total inward investment)  and\r\n\r\nour  third largest investment destination abroad (accounting for\r\n\r\nabout 12 % of total investment abroad).\r\n\r\n.     The  introduction of the Euro with the target of  monetary\r\n\r\nunion by 2002 is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfundamental  shift.  There are still considerable  uncertainties\r\n\r\nsurrounding the final shape of the European Monetary Union (EMU)\r\n\r\nand  its  effects on EU growth and trade patterns.  Our  current\r\n\r\nassessment of the impact on Singapore is therefore tentative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of a single currency per se should not affect\r\n\r\nthe  volume,  direction and composition of trade and  investment\r\n\r\nflows  significantly.  While a single currency eliminates cross-border  transaction costs and could lead to increase  in  intra-EU(15) trade at the expense of trade with the rest of the world,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no historical evidence that this will necessarily  be\r\n\r\nthe outcome.  For example, the Single European Market was formed\r\n\r\nin  1993  and  yet,  over the period 1990-96, the  trade  growth\r\n\r\nbetween EU (15) and Asia at 9.1 % per annum was faster than  the\r\n\r\nintra-EU (15) trade growth of 3.6 % per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a longer-term perspective, it is widely expected that\r\n\r\nEurope   would  benefit  from  higher  efficiency   and   market\r\n\r\norientation as a result of the EMU.  A stronger EU is likely  to\r\n\r\nincrease  imports  from  Asia and the rest  of  the  world.   To\r\n\r\nqualify for entry into the EMU, according to the criteria of the\r\n\r\nMaastricht  Treaty of 1991, member countries had to  keep  their\r\n\r\ninflation  rates  low,  at not more than 1.5  percentage  points\r\n\r\nabove the average inflation rate of the three countries with the\r\n\r\nlowest  inflation  rates.   Monetary policy  under  the  EMU  is\r\n\r\nexpected  to maintain this price stability and help  keep  price\r\n\r\nincreases at bay.  Given the high import content of our economy,\r\n\r\nthis development should have a small positive effect on imported\r\n\r\ninflation for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, what is the Minister's assessment of\r\n\r\nthe potential use of the Euro as a reserve currency?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I think this question is better\r\n\r\nanswered by MAS or the Finance Ministry.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the number of juvenile\r\n\r\noffenders arrested rose steadily from 1,205 in 1990 to 2,574  in\r\n\r\n1995  before falling to 2,110 in 1996.  Last year, the situation\r\n\r\nstabilised,  with  the  number  of juvenile  offenders  arrested\r\n\r\nrising only slightly by 37 to 2,147.     In the first six months\r\n\r\nof  this year, 1,028 juvenile offenders were arrested, which was\r\n\r\na slight 1.5% increase over the corresponding period last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile delinquents commit mainly property-related\r\n\r\noffences   such  as  shoplifting  and  theft,  and  gang-related\r\n\r\noffences  such as rioting and unlawful assembly.   The  increase\r\n\r\nin  the total number of juvenile offenders in 1997 and the first\r\n\r\nsix  months of 1998 is mainly due to more juveniles arrested for\r\n\r\nshoplifting and other property-related offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile delinquency is a multi-faceted problem. The\r\n\r\nreasons why a juvenile turns to crime are diverse and complex in\r\n\r\nnature.    Studies  on  juvenile problems have  shown  that  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for juvenile delinquency include ineffective parenting,\r\n\r\nparental  neglect,  boredom, undesirable peer influence,  greed,\r\n\r\nthe  desire to do the unconventional, or a combination of  these\r\n\r\nfactors.   We have not detected specific juvenile problems  that\r\n\r\nneed to be urgently addressed so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only with more information can Government, families and the\r\n\r\nsociety  in  general  be  able  to  target  specific  groups  of\r\n\r\njuveniles  that  need assistance most.   This  is  being  looked\r\n\r\ninto.     MCD is chairing an Inter-Agency Work Group, which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  set  up to develop a centralised inter-agency database  on\r\n\r\njuvenile  pre-delinquents and delinquents.  This  database  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the monitoring of juvenile delinquency trends.    It\r\n\r\nwill  also  help to highlight specific juvenile  problems.    In\r\n\r\naddition,  the Inter-Ministry Committee on Juvenile  Delinquency\r\n\r\n(IMJD)  has  also commissioned a study on juvenile  delinquency,\r\n\r\nwhich is expected to be completed by year-end.   This study will\r\n\r\nalso provide further insights on why juveniles turn delinquent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> There seems to be a worrying\r\n\r\ntrend towards a more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nviolent   behaviour  amongst  our  youths,  such   as   rioting,\r\n\r\ngangsterism and street fights.  I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nhow  serious  is  this, and whether we are  meting  more  severe\r\n\r\npunishments towards these offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The courts have taken a tough\r\n\r\nstand,  particularly  against this area of  teens  fighting  and\r\n\r\nrioting.   As  I  have indicated in my speech,  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nrioting  has  been there for some time.  It was  contained  last\r\n\r\nyear.  In fact, in the first six months of this year, as I  have\r\n\r\nindicated,  the  total number of offenders has  been  about  the\r\n\r\nsame,  but  the number of offenders caught for shop-lifting  and\r\n\r\nother  property-related offences has gone up much more.  So  the\r\n\r\nearly indications in the first six months of this year are quite\r\n\r\npositive.  The other matter is that when we talk about  juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency, we are talking about the under-16s.  Of course,  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  youths above 16s also fight.  They are  the  youths.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  have to look at is a more composite picture.  So  IMJD\r\n\r\nwill do that, and not just address the problem from the juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquents' point of view, but even those above 16.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> The Minister of State cited figures for\r\n\r\njuvenile  offenders.  In the Minister of State's assessment,  is\r\n\r\nthis merely the tip of the iceberg?  In other words, is there an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  terms of youth joining youth gangs?  Is  there  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in ill-discipline in schools, for instance?   To  what\r\n\r\nextent are these figures on juvenile offenders which give us  no\r\n\r\ncause  for  concern  really  just something  which  may  not  be\r\n\r\nindicative of a general trend as a whole?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Youths go through phases in their\r\n\r\nlives.  At a certain age, when they are probably in secondary 1,\r\n\r\nsecondary  2,  secondary  3,  I  think  they  are  looking   for\r\n\r\nexcitement.  They are very easily influenced by peers.  So  what\r\n\r\nis  important,  as  I have said in my answer, is  the  parenting\r\n\r\neffect.   The  key  point  which  we  would  have  to  emphasise\r\n\r\ncontinually  and work with the CDCs and other VWOs  is  to  help\r\n\r\nparents  understand  what their teens are  going  through.   The\r\n\r\nimportant thing is that whilst the teens undergo\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthrough  this  phase, which I think all teens will  go  through,\r\n\r\nthey  should  not fall beyond the abyss.

As\r\n\r\nI  have  said  in  my  answer, it is  a  multi-faceted  problem.\r\n\r\nFighting  is  something  that  has  emerged,  but  it  has  been\r\n\r\ncontained.

I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nbegin  by declaring my interests,  as a Deputy Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof  NTUC, the Chairman of the National Computer Board,  a  Board\r\n\r\nMember  of  the  EDB  and  PSB, and a Member  of  Singapore  21,\r\n\r\nManpower 21, and the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1992 when I was working with the EDB, we presented\r\n\r\nthe  economic strategy of Singapore to the Chairman and  CEO  of\r\n\r\none  of  the world's largest corporations.  We were there trying\r\n\r\nto  get  him  to invest more in Singapore.  At the  end  of  our\r\n\r\npresentation, this Chairman, who had just taken over the running\r\n\r\nof  the  corporation  and   gone through  a  major  exercise  of\r\n\r\ndownsizing  and  retrenchment,  commented  that  he   was   very\r\n\r\nimpressed by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  strategy of Singapore.  He said  the way  we  ran  our\r\n\r\neconomy  in Singapore was very much like the way he ran his  big\r\n\r\ncorporation,  a  global  operation.   We  thanked  him  for  his\r\n\r\ncompliment  and  pointed  out to  him  that  there  is  one  big\r\n\r\ndifference  between  running a big  corporation  and  running  a\r\n\r\nnational economy.  We pointed out to him that in the case  of  a\r\n\r\ncorporation, when business is not doing well, when  the  company\r\n\r\nneeds  to  restructure to remain competitive, you can  downsize,\r\n\r\nyou can retrench to be lean and trim again.  But in the case  of\r\n\r\na  national  economy, a country cannot just simply retrench  and\r\n\r\ndownsize the country, the workforce, because at the end  of  the\r\n\r\nday we still have to find jobs for every Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this precisely is the challenge facing us\r\n\r\ntoday.   For  the last 30-over years, in the process of  nation-building,  we have been very conscious about the need to  create\r\n\r\nmore  than  just a competitive economy.  Because we realise  and\r\n\r\nunderstand that at the end of the day, the long-term survival of\r\n\r\nSingapore rests not just with a competitive economy but equally,\r\n\r\nif  not more importantly, on a cohesive society and a strong and\r\n\r\nresilient  nation.  In fact, if you look back the  last  20-over\r\n\r\nyears,  since  the  mid-70s,  the  standard  of  living  of  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   has  improved  tremendously   because   of   full\r\n\r\nemployment.   As a result, there is no widening of  income  gap,\r\n\r\nthere  is no widening of social gap, standard of living, and  so\r\n\r\non.  What  we  have today is both a competitive  economy  and  a\r\n\r\ncohesive society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, full employment in Singapore is likely to come to\r\n\r\nan  end this year.  If you look at the economy today, for  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean who is still having a job, I assume  we have  to  be\r\n\r\nat  least 1% to 2% more productive  than last year, so  that  we\r\n\r\ncan still keep our job.  And yet at the same time, the workforce\r\n\r\nis  growing,  because every year we have 40,000 to 50,000  young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans joining the workforce, maybe 10,000 to 15,000 older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  retiring from the workforce.  So there  is  a  net\r\n\r\ngrowth in the workforce\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  about  1 1/2% to 2%.  In other words, the economy will have  to\r\n\r\ngrow by  about 3% to 4% every year, in order that everyone of us\r\n\r\nwho  is  having a job can continue to keep the  job, and at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  to  create enough jobs for the new entrants  to  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.  So we need to have 3% to 4% growth a year.   But  we\r\n\r\nare  not going to see 3% to 4% growth this year, and not  likely\r\n\r\nnext year.  The Government has projected that GDP this year will\r\n\r\ngrow  at  maybe  between 0.5% and 1.5%.  That will  be  about  2\r\n\r\npercentage points or so less than the 3% to 4% needed to sustain\r\n\r\nthe present level of employment.  Therefore, it is possible that\r\n\r\nunemployment rates in Singapore may reach as high as  4%  before\r\n\r\nthe  end of the year.  And if slow growth were to continue  into\r\n\r\nnext  year,  then by the end of next year, if we do run  into  a\r\n\r\nrecession, unemployment may even reach 5% to 7%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I want to highlight here is this. Looking at\r\n\r\nthe nation, we can talk about unemployment of 4%, 5%, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut  the  workers, who are unemployed, to them  unemployment  is\r\n\r\n100%  when you do not have a job.  It is for this reason that  I\r\n\r\nfelt   it  is very important that the entire nation, whether  we\r\n\r\nare  Government,  unionists or employers, all  Singaporeans,  we\r\n\r\nmust   come  together to rally the support,  work  united,  stay\r\n\r\nunited,  and ask ourselves this question: what are the three  to\r\n\r\nfive  most  important  things  we  have  to  do  together,  work\r\n\r\ntogether, in order to manage and contain  rising unemployment in\r\n\r\nthe near future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, various ways we can try to regain\r\n\r\nfull  employment  or to defer unemployment.   Some  people  have\r\n\r\nsuggested  that since we have a healthy reserve, why  don't   we\r\n\r\nspend  more  money - the consumers be given tax incentives,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  increases the budget.  Then by spending more  money,\r\n\r\nhopefully, we can prop up the economy to the 3% to 4% needed  to\r\n\r\nsustain full employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did a simple calculation. Based on the report I read in\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  about leakage through import,  if  we  were  to\r\n\r\nincrease  consumer spending or government spending  to  increase\r\n\r\nGDP growth from 0.5% to 4%, an increase of 3.5\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npercentage points, we would have to inject an equivalent of   5%\r\n\r\nof GDP of spending for  GDP growth to  go up to 4%.  5% out of a\r\n\r\nGDP  of $143 billion, as at the  end of last year, works out  to\r\n\r\nabout  $7  billion,  meaning that we have to  spend  another  $7\r\n\r\nbillion in the economy to boost the economic growth.   I  called\r\n\r\nup  HDB and asked how many flats they can build with $7 billion.\r\n\r\nThey  said: 61,000 4-room flats.  I called up MOH and asked  how\r\n\r\nmany  hospitals they can build with $7 billion.  They  said:  20\r\n\r\nhospitals with 800 beds each.  I called up the LTA and asked how\r\n\r\nmany  LRTs they can build with $7 billion.  They said: 14  LRTs,\r\n\r\neach one costing $500 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my point here is this. $7 billion is a lot of money.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to talk about spending $7 billion, but by the time we\r\n\r\ntranslate the $7 billion into real goods and services,  then  we\r\n\r\nunderstand.  It is not possible for the Government  or  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  just  throw  $7 billion to building  another  61,000\r\n\r\nflats,  another 14 LRTs, another 20 hospitals, just to keep  the\r\n\r\neconomy  growing, just to defer unemployment.  So  spending  our\r\n\r\nway  out of a slowdown is a no-go solution.  Then somebody said,\r\n\r\nif  that  is  the  case, why don't  we  send  back  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers?  After all, there are about 450,000 foreign workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, which is equivalent to about 25% of our workforce  of\r\n\r\n1.8 million.  Theoretically speaking, if unemployment were to go\r\n\r\nup by 2% to 3% every year, we can just downsize our workforce by\r\n\r\nsending back the equivalent number of foreign workers.   So  25%\r\n\r\nof  the workforce of foreign workers can defer unemployment,  in\r\n\r\ntheory, by 10 years, because every year we send back 2.5% of the\r\n\r\nworkforce.  So we can defer by 10 years.  That sounds very good,\r\n\r\nvery  attractive.  But if you were to look into the  composition\r\n\r\nof the foreign workers, one-third are construction workers; one-third  are  domestic maids; and then how about the  nurses,  how\r\n\r\nabout the workers who work on shift, the skilled workers working\r\n\r\nat wafer fabrication plants and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I come to this guesstimate that if we were to\r\n\r\nlook at the number of jobs taken by the foreign workers which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporean workers are willing to do, are able to do, maybe the\r\n\r\nnumber  is  down to 70,000 or so.  And how long can 70,000  last\r\n\r\nus?   My  guess is one year, maybe two years, and after that  we\r\n\r\nwill  run out of foreign workers to send back.  Then what do  we\r\n\r\ndo?   Unemployment will still be there.  Then some said, if that\r\n\r\nis  the case, it is so difficult to spend the money and to  send\r\n\r\nback foreign workers, how about setting up an unemployment fund?\r\n\r\nSo, again, I did a simple calculation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming unemployment was to rise by 1%, which means 18,000\r\n\r\nworkers out of a base of 1.8 million, assuming we pay them  $500\r\n\r\na  month,  it will cost the Government $100 million a  year,  at\r\n\r\n$500  a  month for each of these retrenched workers.  Then  what\r\n\r\nnext?   Now  you pay $500, two months later they will come  back\r\n\r\nand  say  $500  is not enough, how about $700, how about  $1000?\r\n\r\nAlso,  do  not  forget, if we do not address the real  issue  of\r\n\r\nunemployment, the number will go up, which means over time, what\r\n\r\nis going to happen is that Singapore will become a welfare state\r\n\r\nwhereby  employers say it is okay to retrench because the  State\r\n\r\nwill take care of them.  The workers will say, \"No hurry to find\r\n\r\njobs  because the State will take care of me.\"  If that  is  the\r\n\r\ncase, eventually, we are going to go down the tube.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whether spending money, sending back foreign workers\r\n\r\nor  setting  up an unemployment fund, in my view,  I  feel  very\r\n\r\nstrongly  that this should not be the three to five things  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  be worrying and thinking about at a time like  this.\r\n\r\nAt  a time like this, the most important thing is to think about\r\n\r\nhow  we  can  preserve jobs, how we can upgrade  the  skills  of\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to talk about what are the three to\r\n\r\nfive things I think we can do.  The first thing we need to do is\r\n\r\nto  see  in  what way we can minimise unemployment in the  short\r\n\r\nterm.   There are four ways we can minimise unemployment in  the\r\n\r\nshort   term.    Firstly,  keep  costs   low;   secondly,   keep\r\n\r\nproductivity   high;  thirdly,  retrain  rather  than   retrench\r\n\r\nworkers; and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlastly,  offer job placement services, employment assistance  to\r\n\r\nthe  retrenched workers so that we can help them find jobs.   If\r\n\r\nyou  think  about  it,  this is precisely  what  the  tripartite\r\n\r\npartners  are doing - the Government, the unions and  employers.\r\n\r\nThese are what we have been doing over the last few months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of cost competitiveness, the tripartite\r\n\r\npartners  have agreed to go on a wage restraint.  The Government\r\n\r\nhas  also introduced various cost-cutting measures to reduce the\r\n\r\nnon-wage  costs.  The tripartite panel on retrenched workers  is\r\n\r\nnow  working  on things like retrenchment advisory,  encouraging\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  go  for  retraining of  workers  rather  than  to\r\n\r\nretrench workers, to go for a shorter work week rather  than  to\r\n\r\ndownsize  companies.  And at the same time, through  initiatives\r\n\r\nlike  the Labour Net and Back-to-Work programme, and so  on,  we\r\n\r\nare  helping  retrenched workers to find jobs.  All  in  all,  I\r\n\r\nthink  a lot has been done, and is being done.  However,  if  we\r\n\r\nwere  to look ahead to the future, a lot more needs to be  done,\r\n\r\nbecause the slow growth that is coming our way is likely to be a\r\n\r\nprolonged  one.   And  to  what  extent  we  are  able  to  keep\r\n\r\nunemployment  low, I think, depends on whether we  are  able  to\r\n\r\nchange  our  mindset.  When I said \"we\", I refer  again  to  the\r\n\r\nwhole nation, not just the Government, not just the unions,  but\r\n\r\nalso the employers and the workers.  Let me explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on the part of the workers, it is important for\r\n\r\nour  workers in Singapore to change their mindset towards  jobs.\r\n\r\nWe  should  never  take full employment for granted;  we  should\r\n\r\nnever  take  jobs for granted.  At this moment, even  though  we\r\n\r\ntalk  about  unemployment and slow growth, there are still  many\r\n\r\njobs in Singapore where employers are looking for workers.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  they  are looking for will be workers who are prepared  to\r\n\r\nwork  in  shifts, prepared to travel the distance to the factory\r\n\r\nlocation and be prepared to upgrade to have the skills to do the\r\n\r\njob.   Therefore, for the Singaporean workers, it  is  important\r\n\r\nthat  at  a  time like this, we should learn to value  jobs  and\r\n\r\nlearn to change our mindset.  It is all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nright  to travel a little bit further to the factory; it is  all\r\n\r\nright  to  go  on  a  shift  job; it is  all  right  to  go  for\r\n\r\nretraining.   But  at  the same time, it is  important  for  the\r\n\r\nemployers  to change their mindset too.  We have come to  notice\r\n\r\nthat  many  employers  are still preferring  to  employ  younger\r\n\r\nworkers.   Any Singaporean worker who is more than 40 years  old\r\n\r\nis  considered  as  old.  As a result,  in  the  course  of  job\r\n\r\nplacement,  we  have come across many situations  whereby  older\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are more than 40 years old are not  even  able  to\r\n\r\nsecure interviews.  They are stopped at the factory gates.   The\r\n\r\nsecurity guards say that they have received instructions not  to\r\n\r\nlet  anybody who is more than 40 years old to come  in  for  job\r\n\r\ninterviews,  not  even  to fill up the  job  application  forms,\r\n\r\nbecause the company is not interested in them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, what we are going through is an aging\r\n\r\npopulation. The workforce is aging.  If every employer  were  to\r\n\r\nthink that anybody who is more than 40 years old is too old  for\r\n\r\nemployment,  then  we  are going in for a  very  serious  social\r\n\r\nproblem.    I think it is important for the employers to  change\r\n\r\ntheir mindset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area the employers should also change their\r\n\r\nmindset is the concept of wage versus productivity.  For  a  few\r\n\r\nyears  now, at the National Wages Council, we often debate about\r\n\r\nthis issue of whether wage cost in Singapore is rising too fast.\r\n\r\nThe very favourite line adopted is that, if you look at the real\r\n\r\nwage  of  Singapore  over the last few years,  it  has  exceeded\r\n\r\nproductivity  gain. Therefore, we are becoming less competitive.\r\n\r\nBut  I  think there is another way to look at this.  The problem\r\n\r\nis not because our wage cost is going up too fast but rather our\r\n\r\nproductivity  is not going up fast enough.  For many  years,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  riding the wave of high growth.  When the growth  is\r\n\r\nhigh, it does not matter what we do, just put in more equipment,\r\n\r\nmore  people, we achieve high productivity.  But at a time  like\r\n\r\nthis and looking ahead in the future, I think the challenge  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  how  to be able to produce more  with  less,  ie,\r\n\r\nproduce  more output with less equipment, less technology,  less\r\n\r\nworkers.   The concept is known as the Total Factor Productivity\r\n\r\n(TFP).   It is at a time like this that we must bite the  bullet\r\n\r\nand ask\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nourselves:  have we done enough all these years to  improve  the\r\n\r\nTFP  in  Singapore and, if not, what more can we do?   Deferring\r\n\r\nthe  problem is not the solution because the environment of  the\r\n\r\nfuture will change, and become even more competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the part of the unions, we need to change our\r\n\r\nmindset too.  We have to change our mindset to one of to be pro-worker, we have to be pro-business.  If we are not pro-business,\r\n\r\ncompanies  cannot  grow  and cannot be profitable.   Eventually,\r\n\r\nworkers  will  suffer because either they do not get  good  wage\r\n\r\nincrease or they may even lose their jobs.  In this regard, I am\r\n\r\npleased to say that the labour movement in Singapore takes pride\r\n\r\nin  being  one  of  the  first in the  world  to  adopt  such  a\r\n\r\nprogressive view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the NTUC has formulated NTUC 21 in April 1997, and\r\n\r\nthat was before we were hit by the slow growth.  Under NTUC  21,\r\n\r\nwe  have  made  a  formal declaration that  we  do  take  shared\r\n\r\nresponsibility towards the competitiveness of the companies  and\r\n\r\nenhancing  the  life-long employability of the  workers.   Right\r\n\r\nnow,  the unions affiliated to NTUC are  formulating their Union\r\n\r\n21  plan to see how the labour movement can add value, not  just\r\n\r\nto the workers, but also to the economy and the employers.  This\r\n\r\nis something we will continue to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how about on the part of the Government? The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should also think about changing the mindset  in  at\r\n\r\nleast  two  areas.  The first area is in the area of  employment\r\n\r\nassistance.   For  many years, employment assistance  has  never\r\n\r\nbeen  an issue because we have full employment.  But if you look\r\n\r\nahead  in  the  future, we should not take it for  granted  that\r\n\r\nworkers will always have jobs, not because there are not  enough\r\n\r\njobs  to go around, but because of the mismatch either in  terms\r\n\r\nof  skills, age or location.   I think it is important  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  give  this  whole idea of  employment  placement\r\n\r\nservices  higher  priority  and to think  in  what  way  we  can\r\n\r\nstrengthen and enhance the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area I hope the Government agencies will\r\n\r\nconsider  to change their mindset is an issue which I  discussed\r\n\r\nat  the  last Budget debate.  In the business world, competition\r\n\r\nis  so  keen that companies have changed over the years  from  a\r\n\r\ncost-plus  mentality  to a price-minus  mentality.   Instead  of\r\n\r\nlooking at what is the cost of production of goods and services,\r\n\r\nadd  a   profit  margin and become the selling price,  companies\r\n\r\nbasically look at the market and customers and see what they can\r\n\r\nafford to bear.  From there, they work backwards to see how much\r\n\r\nthey  need to  lower their cost of production so that  they  can\r\n\r\nmeet  the  price  set  by the market and at  the  same  time  be\r\n\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an area I hope the various Government agencies will\r\n\r\nseriously  think  about because, in the  next  few  years,  wage\r\n\r\nincrease  will  be  fairly moderated.  Some workers  may  become\r\n\r\njobless,  and I think they will be concerned about the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving,  and so on.  At the same time, many companies  are  also\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  the  cost  of doing  business.   Sir,  I  hope\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies can think about how they can also  adopt  a\r\n\r\nprice-minus  mentality.   Look  at  the  marketplace   and   the\r\n\r\ncompetition we are facing and ask what kind of prices, what kind\r\n\r\nof  cost  level  can the business community and members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  bear,  and  is  there  any way  the  various  Government\r\n\r\nagencies  can  offer  the service without  compromising  on  the\r\n\r\nquality  of service and, yet, at the same time, be able to  meet\r\n\r\nthe pricing target.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which the Government may want to think about\r\n\r\nis this.  When we talk about the CPF cut being  the last resort,\r\n\r\nthe  question which many people ask is: what does it mean by \"as\r\n\r\na  last  resort\"?  We have asked companies, for example, in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  sector, what are their major  cost  items.   They\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Yes,  wages are important.  But foreign worker  levy  is\r\n\r\nanother major cost item.  Industrial land, factory rentals,  and\r\n\r\nso on, are all major cost items.\"  Sir, is it not possible that,\r\n\r\nbefore  we  talk about the CPF cut, the Government  could  think\r\n\r\nabout\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether there is any way it can lower non-wage  cost in terms of\r\n\r\nforeign  worker levy?  I understand of course that, on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  if we were to lower the foreign worker levy too much,  it\r\n\r\nmay  actually  make  the  Singaporean  workers  less  attractive\r\n\r\ncompared to the foreign workers.  But, yet, at the same time, if\r\n\r\nwe  do not lower the foreign worker levy, employers will keep on\r\n\r\nlooking  at  the  CPF  cut and other wage  cuts  to  make  their\r\n\r\noperations more viable.  Therefore, is it not possible for us to\r\n\r\nthink through this issue ?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we assume that every factory will have some foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  because  of shortage of workers in  Singapore  and,  in\r\n\r\norder not to encourage employers to retrench Singaporean workers\r\n\r\nand  replace them with foreign workers, why can't  we  have, for\r\n\r\nexample, a three-tier foreign worker levy?  For the first  tier,\r\n\r\nanybody who employs less than 20% of the workforce, in terms  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers, will pay a very low foreign worker  levy,  and\r\n\r\nfor  the  next 20%, he has to pay much more, and the  next  10%,\r\n\r\nfrom  40% to 50%, he will have to pay a lot more.  In this  way,\r\n\r\nwe  help to lower the cost for the businesses and, yet,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, we do not encourage companies to replace Singaporean\r\n\r\nworkers with foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of land and buildings, again, we have discussed\r\n\r\nseveral  times before in this House whether it is  possible  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to review land pricing policy and make  it  more\r\n\r\npredictable  because,  today, it is not predictable.   Companies\r\n\r\nare told that their land lease can be revised up to 7.6% a year.\r\n\r\nUp  to  7.6%, it is very difficult for any company to plan their\r\n\r\nbusiness.  They will never know whether they will be charged  1%\r\n\r\nincrease  or  7.6% increase.  So they are asking  for  something\r\n\r\nmore  predictable.  Is it 3%?  Is it 4%?  It should be something\r\n\r\nmore  predictable.   How about something  more  responsive  too?\r\n\r\nTheir  view is that when the market is good, the rental goes  up\r\n\r\nvery  fast.  When the market is down, the rental comes down very\r\n\r\nslowly, because Government agencies say that the rental today is\r\n\r\nstill  below market rate and therefore they are not entitled  to\r\n\r\nany adjustment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, intensive use of industrial land. We talk about\r\n\r\nhow  we  can  encourage  companies  to  intensify  the  use   of\r\n\r\nindustrial lands which are very expensive in Singapore. We  talk\r\n\r\nabout reviewing the differential premiums, and so on, but to the\r\n\r\nbest of my knowledge, nothing has been done.  Sir, my point here\r\n\r\nis  that,  in  the  past, when the economy was doing  well,  the\r\n\r\nbusiness sector could afford to bear some of these higher costs.\r\n\r\nBut  at  a  time like this, and looking to the next  few  years,\r\n\r\nevery  dollar we can help them to save, we should  do  our  very\r\n\r\nbest.   I  hope the Government agencies can really  think  about\r\n\r\nadopting a new mindset like moving away from a cost-plus towards\r\n\r\nthe price-minus mindset, and ask the business community what  it\r\n\r\ncan  bear  and  what they can do to achieve that kind  of  price\r\n\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I talk about all these issues, I look at them in\r\n\r\na  very positive sense.   I believe that we in Singapore are  in\r\n\r\nthe  best  position to contain rising unemployment.  The  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  we are in the best position is that Singapore is not a  low\r\n\r\ncost location.  If today we are a low cost location, how low can\r\n\r\nwe go?  But since we are not a low cost location, there is still\r\n\r\na  lot of room for us to adjust lower the cost of doing business\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  At the end of the day, the extent  to  which  we\r\n\r\nwill  be able to contain unemployment  depends a lot on  whether\r\n\r\nthe workers  are able to change their mindset towards jobs,  the\r\n\r\nemployers towards older workers and  Government towards the cost\r\n\r\nstructure   in   Singapore.   Having  talked  about   minimising\r\n\r\nunemployment in the short term, I think that is only the  short-term measure and that, in itself, will not be sufficient to  see\r\n\r\nSingapore  through this crisis.  Because by the time the  crisis\r\n\r\nis  over,  we  are going to find ourselves in a  very  different\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to highlight five trends which are\r\n\r\nunstoppable.   Like  it or not, they are already  happening  and\r\n\r\nthey  will  continue to evolve.  Of these five trends,  two  are\r\n\r\nwithin the region.  The first is the realignment of the regional\r\n\r\ncurrencies.   Because  of  the crisis,  the  Singapore  currency\r\n\r\ndropped by 15% to 17%, while the regional currencies dropped  by\r\n\r\n35% to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n84%  in the case of Indonesia.  By the time the crisis is  over,\r\n\r\nwe  are  going  to  see a complete realignment of  the  regional\r\n\r\ncurrencies.   What  it  means is that these countries  vis-a-vis\r\n\r\nSingapore will be about two to five times more cost competitive.\r\n\r\nSo  that  is  the first trend we have to accept.  It is  already\r\n\r\nhappening and there is nothing we can do to stop it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second trend is the potential threat of rising\r\n\r\nprotectionism  in the region.  In the last couple  of  years  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  we  are  beginning to see very intense  competition\r\n\r\nwithin  the  region,  within ASEAN, for example.   We  have  our\r\n\r\nairport,  we  have our  seaport.  They also want to  have  their\r\n\r\nairport and seaport.  Ours is big.  They want to be bigger,  and\r\n\r\nso on.  But competition is not what I am talking about.  What  I\r\n\r\nam  talking  about is,  that  the competition is  turning   into\r\n\r\nunhealthy  competition, and unhealthy competition leads  to  all\r\n\r\nkinds of protectionistic measures.  This is something we have to\r\n\r\nbe concerned about.  When the countries in the region forget how\r\n\r\nto think win-win and  start to think win-lose, at the end of the\r\n\r\nday, it is going to end up lose-lose for all of us.  And we have\r\n\r\nto think about what should be our response.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two trends are more global. Firstly, it is the\r\n\r\nwhole  issue of globalisation.  With globalisation of technology\r\n\r\nand  market,  and  so  on, companies are now  moving  towards  a\r\n\r\nhorizontal division of labour, meaning that they will  start  to\r\n\r\ndeploy  their complete value chain all across Europe, US,  North\r\n\r\nAmerica  and Asia.  What this means is that there will  be  more\r\n\r\nopportunities  for us to strengthen our economic strength.   But\r\n\r\nyet, at the same time, it also means that there will be stronger\r\n\r\nand keener competition for these opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other global trend is technology. Technology is\r\n\r\nmoving  faster and faster.  The good news is that,  with  faster\r\n\r\nchange  in technology, it means we have more room to move ahead.\r\n\r\nBut  the bad news is that we can only continue to ride the  wave\r\n\r\nof technology provided we are able to quicken the pace of change\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  as well to be able to learn new knowledge  faster\r\n\r\nand sooner.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last trend is more domestic, the issue of an aging\r\n\r\npopulation.  With  a  longer  lifespan  of  people  and  shorter\r\n\r\nlifespan of technology, the  issue of employability will  become\r\n\r\nmore acute in the future.  So given this new environment that we\r\n\r\nare  already  in which will only get more intense, in  terms  of\r\n\r\ncompetition,  pace  of change, and so on,  there  are  basically\r\n\r\nthree scenarios for Singapore in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first scenario is one of unemployment. The second\r\n\r\nscenario  is  one  of  structural unemployment,  and  the  third\r\n\r\nscenario  is  full  employment.  If we are not  able  to  remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive in this new economic reality, then obviously we will\r\n\r\nbe heading for unemployment forever.  If we are competitive, but\r\n\r\nwe  are not able to upgrade the workforce, retrain the workforce\r\n\r\nfast   enough,   then   we   are  heading   towards   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment.  But if we are able to do both, to be  competitive\r\n\r\nand  at the same time ensure the employability of the workforce,\r\n\r\nthen   of  course  we  have  a  chance  to  head   towards  full\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, before the crisis, I was very sure that we were\r\n\r\nmoving  from full employment to structural unemployment  because\r\n\r\nwe could observe that we were beginning to have many bad habits,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  was in the economy or in the society.  Workers  did\r\n\r\nnot  take training seriously and employers had no time to  worry\r\n\r\nabout how to train the workforce for the future.  Because of all\r\n\r\nthis,  it  was  very  clear to me that many of  our  new  growth\r\n\r\nsectors in Singapore will increasingly depend on foreign skilled\r\n\r\nworkers,  foreign talents.  If you look at the wafer fabrication\r\n\r\nplants,  tomorrow if we were to stop foreign talents and foreign\r\n\r\nworkers from coming in, all our plants would have to close shop.\r\n\r\nIt  is  good  in  a  way.  It is good that we are  hit  by  this\r\n\r\nslowdown.   Because with this slowdown, it gives us a chance  to\r\n\r\nreflect  on what has happened to the Singapore economy over  the\r\n\r\nlast  five  to  10 years and where are the dangers and  pitfalls\r\n\r\nthat  we  may be trapped in and, therefore, what action  we  can\r\n\r\ntake at a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntime  like this  to correct these  mistakes and, hopefully, come\r\n\r\nout of this slowdown stronger and better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are three areas I would like to propose as\r\n\r\nmust-do  for  discussion  - competitiveness,  employability  and\r\n\r\nnational  unity.   The first must-do for the  long  term  is  to\r\n\r\nenhance the competitiveness of Singapore.  We have many domestic\r\n\r\nsectors  that, over the years, have continued to enjoy very  low\r\n\r\nproductivity.  Take, for example, the retail sector.   Everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that  the retail sector is not doing well  and  everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that there is a surplus of players.  Too many players  in\r\n\r\nthe  market which is not growing fast enough.  And, yet, at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, the pace of restructure and upgrading, for  example,\r\n\r\nin the retail sector is way too slow.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to quote an example of New York city.   New  York\r\n\r\ncity  was  in a hard time in 1990/1991 because of the recession.\r\n\r\nIn fact, companies were closing, workers were retrenched and the\r\n\r\nretail  sector almost came to a standstill.  On Christmas  week,\r\n\r\nthe  whole shopping mall was empty.  But today, if you go to New\r\n\r\nYork city, things have changed.  Is it because they have no more\r\n\r\ncompetition?   It is not quite true.  In New York city,  if  you\r\n\r\nare prepared to drive half an hour out of the city to Queens and\r\n\r\nso  on,  you  will  be able to find many factory  outlets.   The\r\n\r\nfactory  outlets sell the same goods that you can  find  in  the\r\n\r\ncity  but  maybe  30-40% cheaper.  That is why  they  call  them\r\n\r\nfactory  outlets.  Yet, many people, whether local or  tourists,\r\n\r\nare  still prepared to pay a premium and shop in the city.   Why\r\n\r\nis  this so?  It is because they have managed to restructure and\r\n\r\nupgrade.  They have managed to change mindsets, from quantity to\r\n\r\nquality.   Macys  used to be the largest shopping  mall  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   They are successful because they are big.   Anything  a\r\n\r\nperson  wants to buy, he can find it there.  But today,  in  New\r\n\r\nYork  city, they cannot operate on the basis of just having more\r\n\r\nstock  items on the shelf.  This does not bring them  customers.\r\n\r\nIt is the value added service that they talk about.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point here is this. When can we start to get some\r\n\r\nof  our domestic retailers  to change their mindset?  Things are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  difficult over the next few years.  Just  to  sit\r\n\r\nthere,  sit  tight and do nothing is not going to  do  them  any\r\n\r\ngood.  Can we find ways of helping the domestic retail sector to\r\n\r\nupgrade  and  to  grow again, help them to shift their  mindset,\r\n\r\nfrom  quantity to quality, from hardware to software?   Hardware\r\n\r\nmeans  just  more  goods and more people and software  is  value\r\n\r\nadded services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area is to create new jobs in new growth\r\n\r\nsectors.   Many of the jobs which we are losing today  will  not\r\n\r\ncome  back  to  Singapore forever.  For  example,  the  consumer\r\n\r\nelectronics  sector has been downsizing and the  jobs  that  are\r\n\r\ngoing away will not come back.  Why should they come back?   Two\r\n\r\nor three years from now when the market is back, if they look at\r\n\r\nthe  cost  structure in Singapore vis-a-vis the region,  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing to be so much more expensive, as I mentioned earlier,  due\r\n\r\nto  the realignment of the regional currencies.  So what we have\r\n\r\nto  do is to look for new growth sectors and areas where we  can\r\n\r\ncompete  based  on our new capabilities.  For example,  analogue\r\n\r\nconsumer electronics is going down.  But that does not  mean  we\r\n\r\nshould  give  up  consumer electronics, because  after  analogue\r\n\r\nconsumer  electronics,  there  is  this  thing  called   digital\r\n\r\nconsumer   electronics.   Since   we  are  not  competitive   in\r\n\r\nanalogue, why  not go for digital?  Why  not start building  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, the capability and go for this new  product  and\r\n\r\nnew services in the future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about building new capabilities? In the 60s and 70s,\r\n\r\nwhen  we went through the process of industrialisation,  we  did\r\n\r\nnot  have  any  market  in  Singapore.   We  did  not  have  any\r\n\r\ntechnology in Singapore.  What did we do?  What we did not have,\r\n\r\nwe  borrowed.  So we went  to the MNCs and we brought  them  in.\r\n\r\nWe  did  not  have a market.  We borrowed their  market.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  MNCs exported out of Singapore.  In a way, we  borrowed\r\n\r\ntheir global market.  We did not have technology.  So we brought\r\n\r\nin their know-how in processes, products and applications into\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore.   So  by borrowing their technology, borrowing  their\r\n\r\nmarket  and by creating a conducive environment for mass  volume\r\n\r\nproduction, we were able to earn a living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question is, in the future, given the five global\r\n\r\ntrends  which  I  mentioned earlier, is it possible  for  us  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to earn a living by borrowing technology and borrowing\r\n\r\nmarkets  from the global players?  I do not think so.   I  think\r\n\r\nwhat we have to do, looking ahead in the future, is to move away\r\n\r\nfrom  a  cost  containment  strategy  to  a  revenue  generation\r\n\r\nstrategy.  Revenue generation means: can we try to create  value\r\n\r\nout  of technology, out of ideas, out of markets, for the global\r\n\r\nplayers?   It means: can we offer a platform in Singapore  which\r\n\r\nwill  have the integrated capabilities in technology development\r\n\r\nthrough R&D, in innovation development, being able to design new\r\n\r\nproducts, new processes, new applications, new services, be able\r\n\r\nto do market development, help them to create markets in Asia or\r\n\r\nin  cyberspace, the new market that we talk about in the future?\r\n\r\nIf  we  are able to do so, then I think the future for Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  continue to be a bright one, because we will  be  able  to\r\n\r\ndifferentiate  ourselves and become an  integrated  hub  in  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy of the future.  This is the second  area\r\n\r\nwhere I think we can do a lot more and a lot faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is to strengthen our position as a global\r\n\r\nhub  in the Asia Pacific.  The idea of a global hub is not  new.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in Singapore, we started off as a global hub in the 60s\r\n\r\nand  70s.   What  we  did was to become  a  global  hub  in  the\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   age,   eg,   airport,   seaport,   for   the\r\n\r\ntransportation  and distribution of goods.  In  that  sense,  we\r\n\r\nhelped  to  link the region (ASEAN) to the global  economy.   We\r\n\r\nbecame  the gateway and, as a result, it was win-win.   But  the\r\n\r\nunfortunate  thing  is this.  After so many  years  of  win-win,\r\n\r\ninstead of thanking us for contributing to this linkage  to  the\r\n\r\nglobal  hub,  we are accused of stealing things  away  from  our\r\n\r\nneighbour.  But it does not matter what other people  say  about\r\n\r\nus.  I think at the end of the day, what we have to continue  to\r\n\r\npursue is the strategy of global linkage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFor  the  simple reason, in the competitive world of the future,\r\n\r\nthe  strength  of any economy is not what you  are  able  to  do\r\n\r\nwithin  a country.  It is not the strength of the location  that\r\n\r\nreally  counts.   In  the  future, what  will  really  make  the\r\n\r\ndifference  to  the  competitiveness of  any  location  is  your\r\n\r\nability to strengthen  the network capability, whether you  have\r\n\r\nthe network of resources, expertise, markets, that will make the\r\n\r\ndifference,  meaning that in the future world, we are  going  to\r\n\r\ncompete on a network basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of Singapore, we have come this far in\r\n\r\nbecoming a global hub in the industrialisation age.  I think our\r\n\r\nnext target, our next challenge, must be to become a global  hub\r\n\r\nin  the information economy of the future.  And how can this  be\r\n\r\ndone?   I  am  optimistic  that this can  be  done.   Take,  for\r\n\r\nexample, in the area of IT.  Today, Singapore is one of the best\r\n\r\ncomputerised  nations  in  the world.  Our  infrastructure  like\r\n\r\nSingapore One, for example, is one of the best in the world, one\r\n\r\nof  the most leading infrastructures in the world.  In terms  of\r\n\r\nour legal framework, we have  the Electronic Transactions Act in\r\n\r\nplace.    What  we  have  to  do  is  to  capitalise   on   this\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, this capability, which we have built   over  the\r\n\r\nlast  17-20 years and then to link ourselves to the rest of  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just think for a moment, if today we can find 10 leading\r\n\r\ncities  of the world which are very advanced in the area of  IT,\r\n\r\nwhether  they are in the US, Europe, Japan or Asia Pacific.   If\r\n\r\neach  one of them were to contribute, let us say, 100,000  users\r\n\r\nof broadband multi-media services, then what can be done will be\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  to link up with these 10 leading cities  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.   And  together, we would have created  what  we  call  a\r\n\r\nglobal   information  infrastructure  (GII),   the   information\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  of the future, to support broadband  multi-media\r\n\r\ninteractive  applications and yet cut across  the  world,  North\r\n\r\nAmerica, Europe, Asia Pacific.  And when that happens, Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  very key node and integral hub in the  GII  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  So by the time the region is ready to go for electronic\r\n\r\ncommerce and so on,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  can  then,  like in the old days, link  through  this  GII\r\n\r\nthrough Singapore.  In this way, we will be able to continue  to\r\n\r\nperform  our role as a global hub in the Asia Pacific by helping\r\n\r\nthe  region  to  link  up with the information  economy  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the area of competitiveness, if I may summarise, I\r\n\r\nam   basically  saying  that we have to move  our  mindset  from\r\n\r\ncompeting on the basis of cost competitiveness to a new basis of\r\n\r\ncapability  competitiveness,  and there  is  a  big  difference.\r\n\r\nBeing cost competitive means that I do not have to be as good as\r\n\r\nyou,  but  as long as I am so much cheaper than you, I am  still\r\n\r\nmore  cost competitive.  But to be capability competitive  means\r\n\r\nthat we must aspire to be as good as the best in the world,  and\r\n\r\nthat is what I am talking about.  At a time like this, we should\r\n\r\nreally  think  about how  we can make use of this  lull  period,\r\n\r\nthis spare capacity that we have in the economy, turn it into an\r\n\r\ninvestment for the future, so that we can come out as  the  best\r\n\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The must-do at a time like this is to maximise\r\n\r\nemployability.  I think enough has been said about the  issue of\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment.  So I do not intend to repeat the whole\r\n\r\nissue again, but all I want to say is that in Singapore, we  are\r\n\r\nin   the  best  position  to  tackle  the  issue  of  structural\r\n\r\nunemployment,   better  than  most  other  countries.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  we have always believed in in-employment training.   We\r\n\r\nset  up the Skills Development Fund way back in 1979, almost  20\r\n\r\nyears  ago.    And because of the SDF mechanism,  we  have  been\r\n\r\nretraining/upgrading our workers all these years and that is the\r\n\r\nreason  why  today  we  have one of the  most  cost  competitive\r\n\r\nworkforce in the world.  What we have to recognise now  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  future will be so different from the past and therefore  we\r\n\r\nhave   to  recognise  that  the  present  system  of  continuing\r\n\r\neducation  through SDF may not be enough for us  to  tackle  the\r\n\r\nissue of structural unemployment.  And what we need is to set up\r\n\r\na new national system for continuing education and training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we need to set up a new national framework for\r\n\r\nskills certification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCompanies  today  are  coming  to  Singapore  to  set   up   new\r\n\r\noperations.  So they want to train their workers.  They want  to\r\n\r\nskill  certify their workers.  But some of them found  out  that\r\n\r\nthe  skill  courses that they want to certify their workers  are\r\n\r\neither  not available in Singapore or the skills system  is  not\r\n\r\nwell  defined in Singapore yet.  As a result, they are not  able\r\n\r\nto  proceed  in a systematic way of training the workforce.   So\r\n\r\nthere  are  gaps  in the skills certification system.   In  that\r\n\r\nregard,  the  Government's announcement on the  national  skills\r\n\r\nrecognition system is a most timely move.  We hope that  quicker\r\n\r\nprogress  can be made and we hope that the Government  will  set\r\n\r\nsome  specific  timeframe  for the expansion  of  this  national\r\n\r\nskills recognition system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a national skills recognition system is not enough\r\n\r\nbecause what we have is a system on paper.  We have to turn this\r\n\r\nsystem  on paper into reality, which means we have to set  up  a\r\n\r\nnation-wide  training infrastructure.  We have  to  upgrade  our\r\n\r\ncapabilities in CET.  We have to expand our capacity in CET.  In\r\n\r\nthis  regard, we are very happy that the Government has  decided\r\n\r\nto  set  up  the first full-time training centre for  continuing\r\n\r\neducation  by converting the ITE at Bukit Merah into a full-time\r\n\r\ntraining centre.  I think this is something very strategic.   It\r\n\r\nis  something that would pave the way for the evolution of a new\r\n\r\nnational training infrastructure for CET.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that we do not stop at the\r\n\r\nInstitute  of  Higher Learning (IHL).  We should  encourage  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector to take on that shared responsibility.  Take, for\r\n\r\nexample,  in the electronic sector, they have a training  centre\r\n\r\nco-funded  by  the  Government and the  industry  known  as  the\r\n\r\nElectronic  Industry Training Centre.  This Training  Centre  is\r\n\r\nperforming  a  very  important role in the  present  process  of\r\n\r\nretraining  our workers, and we believe that the  same  concept,\r\n\r\nthe same idea, can be expanded to all the other sectors, whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  in manufacturing or in services.  And if  we  can  do\r\n\r\nthat,  then  over  time  we may be able to  set  up  a  training\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, a training network, linking up both the  IHL  as\r\n\r\nwell as the training centre in the industry and, in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome  cases, for the larger employers who may even have in-house\r\n\r\ntraining centres.   I hope the Government will consider  setting\r\n\r\nup  a  formal mechanism to co-fund this kind of training centres\r\n\r\nin the industry and in the companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can have the facilities, we can have the\r\n\r\ncertification in place, but at the end of the day,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nmobilise  the workers for this training.  I think the  NTUC  and\r\n\r\nthe  employers' federation can play an important role.  Overall,\r\n\r\nwe  estimated  that  there  are  580,000  unskilled  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It will take quite some time for us to retrain  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  all  of them but, hopefully, as  many  of  them  as\r\n\r\npossible.   As I say, we believe that we, in Singapore,  are  in\r\n\r\nthe  best  position to address this, because  the  direction  is\r\n\r\nclear, the resources are there and the tripartism spirit is very\r\n\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even if we were to strengthen our competitiveness\r\n\r\nand enhance our employability, that still does not mean that  we\r\n\r\ncan  have full employment.  Because, at the end of the  day,  it\r\n\r\nall  depends on how we are able to link up the two efforts,  how\r\n\r\nwe  are  able  to synchronise and derive synergy  from  the  two\r\n\r\nefforts.   In   the  OECD countries, in the  case  of  USA,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  they  discovered  that even  though  the   economy  is\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  even though  they are doing a lot to  retrain  the\r\n\r\nworkers,   yet, they cannot escape from structural unemployment.\r\n\r\nThe  conclusion is that the linkage between the two  efforts  is\r\n\r\nnot strong enough.\r\n\r\nSir,   my  suggestion  is  that the manpower  agencies  and  the\r\n\r\neconomic agencies have to work very closely together.  Take  one\r\n\r\nexample.  Today, we have workers who are now prepared to go  for\r\n\r\nretraining   because   of   the  crisis,   because   of   rising\r\n\r\nunemployment.   They are prepared to go for  three  months,  six\r\n\r\nmonths  or  one  year of retraining in order to secure  new  and\r\n\r\nbetter  jobs  in the new growth sectors.  But our  challenge  is\r\n\r\nthat, if tomorrow, 5,000 workers are prepared to go through  the\r\n\r\nprocess of retraining, do we know in what area do we train  them\r\n\r\nfor?  My point here is that we need the economic agencies to  be\r\n\r\nmore  specific in identifying employment opportunities over  the\r\n\r\nnext\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n1-3  years  and  be able to, as far as possible, give  an  early\r\n\r\nprojection.  This is because retraining of workers  has  a  long\r\n\r\nlead time, at least six months, if not one to two years.  If  we\r\n\r\nare  not  able  to  have early information on  where  these  job\r\n\r\nopportunities are coming from, it is very difficult  for  us  to\r\n\r\nretrain the workers, because by the time we retrain them,  again\r\n\r\nthey are going to miss the boat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my point here is that, as a strategic intent, I should\r\n\r\nsay  it  is  a  national  challenge, to  systematically  migrate\r\n\r\nworkers  from the declining sector into the new growth  sectors.\r\n\r\nIf  we can do that, and do that in sufficient numbers, then I am\r\n\r\nconfident  that Singapore can be one of the first  countries  in\r\n\r\nthe world to avoid structural unemployment.  Again, I am hopeful\r\n\r\nbecause  today we have Manpower 21 and we have the Committee  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's Competitiveness.  What we have to do is to  link  up\r\n\r\nthe two into something more tangible and actionable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, for the long term, besides strengthening\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  and employability, we need  to  strengthen  our\r\n\r\nnational  unity.  The crisis   is something  we  did   not  wish\r\n\r\nfor,   but  it  has  happened.   It  is  actually  a  very  rare\r\n\r\nopportunity if we look at it positively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I talked about competitiveness and employability,\r\n\r\nwhich  basically  is  to  strengthen and  enhance  the  economic\r\n\r\nstakes  of  Singaporeans in the Singapore of  the  future.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  is this:  is this also a great opportunity for  us  to\r\n\r\nenhance  and strengthen the emotional stakes of Singaporeans  in\r\n\r\nthe Singapore of the future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been talking about this in the last one year or so,\r\n\r\nsince  the  launch  of  the Singapore 21  Committee  chaired  by\r\n\r\nMinister Teo Chee Hean.  There is a lot of discussion about  the\r\n\r\npeople  sector.  In fact, Minister Teo coined the  term  \"people\r\n\r\nsector\" as against the private sector and public sector, which I\r\n\r\nthought was a very exciting idea.  The question is: how  can  we\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  this  opportunity as a way for us  to  strengthen\r\n\r\nheartware  and nurture an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nactive  people sector?  Take, for example, between  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  and the public sector.  We often have this public debate\r\n\r\n-   the  private  sector  will say the public  sector  does  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  the  rain is really pouring,  and  the  public\r\n\r\nsector  will  say  the private sector does not  understand  that\r\n\r\ngovernment   cannot bail out companies.  So there is  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ndebate and disagreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own observation is that in a way we have to recognise\r\n\r\nand  accept that different business sectors have different  cost\r\n\r\nstructures.   So  one  solution which may be  relevant  to  some\r\n\r\nsectors may not be relevant to the other sectors.  Up till  now,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  been trying to do is to come out with  a  common\r\n\r\nsolution  which  will be common to all sectors.   As  a  result,\r\n\r\nthere  is  this  mismatch between the solution  and  the  needs.\r\n\r\nMaybe  one  possibility  as a way of strengthening  this  active\r\n\r\npartnership between the public sector and the private sector  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  private  sector  to do a proper  analysis.   Can  they\r\n\r\nanalyse  better what is their cost structure, put out a stronger\r\n\r\ncase  to  explain their position better, and in what way certain\r\n\r\nmeasures  can help them more than what is being done today?   If\r\n\r\nwe  can  go through a process of consultation and collaboration,\r\n\r\nexchange  of  views  and debate the views,  then  hopefully  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector and the private sector can come closer  together.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, how about the people sector?  Again, we  talk\r\n\r\nabout the active citizenship of the people sector.  This can  be\r\n\r\ndone.   At a  time like this, why do we not encourage the people\r\n\r\nof   Singapore   to  come  forward  with  their   creative   and\r\n\r\nconstructive  ideas on how we, as a nation, can go through  this\r\n\r\ncrisis and come out stronger?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to make use of this opportunity in the right\r\n\r\nway,  the  Government  can  make  use  of  this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nencourage  active  citizenship from the people  sector  and  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector, which is what Singapore 21 was set up to do.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  the people sector and the private  sector,  by\r\n\r\nbeing responsible and constructive, can also gain the confidence\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  that  effective participation  of  the  3Ps\r\n\r\n(people, public and private sectors) can actually\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlead  to a greater trust, greater respect and, most importantly,\r\n\r\ngreater  sense  of  ownership of all the national  policies  and\r\n\r\nissues.   At the end of the day, I think it can be done  because\r\n\r\nwe  have Singapore 21, where the message is very clear.  What we\r\n\r\nhave  to do is to quickly seize this opportunity so that we  can\r\n\r\nstay united at a time of crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to say that we have got to\r\n\r\nwhere  we  are  here today since 1965 from a no-hope  situation.\r\n\r\nBut  today, we are getting to Singapore 21, not only not from  a\r\n\r\nno-hope  situation, but actually we are getting there  from  the\r\n\r\nbest-hope  situation.   After  all  these  30  years  of  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding,  now  we  have a competitive economy  and  a  cohesive\r\n\r\nsociety.   Our  challenge is - if we can do it right,  not  only\r\n\r\nwill  we  be  able to minimise unemployment in the  short  term,\r\n\r\nmaximise  our  competitiveness and employability  for  the  long\r\n\r\nterm, but  more importantly, we should be able to strengthen the\r\n\r\nemotional stakes of Singaporeans in Singapore 21.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I beg to move the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  every businessman has been saying time is bad and everyone\r\n\r\nagrees  that  it  will  be worse. Every day  when  we  read  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers and listen to the news, we learn that  more and  more\r\n\r\ncompanies are winding up and many workers are retrenched.  It is\r\n\r\ngetting  from  bad  to worse.  More and more people  are  losing\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs.  We also hear a lot of grumblings from the  people.\r\n\r\nSome companies have simply closed down and the workers lamented,\r\n\r\n\"Retrenched today, no more job for me tomorrow!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen are grumbling, \"The banks are most merciless,\r\n\r\nthey  keep  on  pressing us for payments.\"   In June this  year,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  announced  the  off-Budget  measures  where  $2\r\n\r\nbillion  were  pumped  in to bring forward the  construction  of\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,  and   to  help the businessmen  tide  over  the\r\n\r\ndifficult times.  But they say that the Government is not  doing\r\n\r\nenough.  More rebates should be given.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans who are yet to be retrenched are\r\n\r\nworried  that  they would be retrenched. They are  worried  that\r\n\r\nonce  their CPF contribution is reduced, they will have problems\r\n\r\nservicing  their housing loans.  With all these worries,   their\r\n\r\nconfidence  is lost.  So at this time when we are threatened  by\r\n\r\nthis regional financial crisis we should pull ourselves together\r\n\r\nand  face  the problem together.  In the short term,  we  should\r\n\r\nminimise  unemployment and in the long  term  we  will  have  to\r\n\r\nimprove  our competitiveness.  To attain these targets,  whether\r\n\r\nyou are the employer, employee  or Government, you must first of\r\n\r\nall  have  confidence and the determination to face the problems\r\n\r\nsquarely  and  work out long-term strategies to  strengthen  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall elaborate on the roles of the employers, employees\r\n\r\nand  the  Government.  First, let us talk about  the  employers.\r\n\r\nWhen  this financial crisis came all of a sudden, many companies\r\n\r\nwere caught off-guard.  When business is bad, they try ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  to  cut cost and  resort to downsizing their  operations.\r\n\r\nIn  many  circumstances, our employers still have a heart.  They\r\n\r\nwould discuss with the union representatives and arrange for the\r\n\r\nworkers  to undergo  retraining so that they can cross  over  to\r\n\r\nthe  high-tech   industries and command  higher wages.   We  say\r\n\r\nthat  the bosses do have a heart.  An accountant friend of  mine\r\n\r\nwho  works  in  an advertising company said that this  year  the\r\n\r\ncompany's business was reduced by 70% and most of the  time  the\r\n\r\nstaff  had nothing to do.   The management then  discussed  with\r\n\r\nthe  staff and they all agreed that in order to keep their  jobs\r\n\r\nand  stay  employed, they accepted a  wage cut,  and   they  are\r\n\r\nallowed to take on part-time jobs outside.  So they retain  good\r\n\r\nemployer-employee relationship,  the company could  continue  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  and  they  have employees who have developed  a  strong\r\n\r\nsense of belonging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the unions affiliated to NTUC are working hand in hand\r\n\r\nwith  companies  affected  by this downturn.   The  workers  are\r\n\r\neither on shorter work week or temporarily laid off or attending\r\n\r\nthe Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, employees who are retrenched are not\r\n\r\nconfined to ordinary workers in the manufacturing sector and the\r\n\r\nservice  industry.   Many  managers and company  executives  are\r\n\r\ngiven  the  golden  handshake.  Even CEOs and  General  Managers\r\n\r\ncould be retrenched.  There are, in fact, more and more cases of\r\n\r\nthis nature. These managers and executives are neither here  nor\r\n\r\nthere. It is difficult for them to secure alternative jobs. Some\r\n\r\nof  them  have  to  maintain  their parents  and  support  their\r\n\r\nfamilies, with  housing loans and car loans to service, and lots\r\n\r\nof other financial commitments.  They are prepared to work - any\r\n\r\nkind  of  work! So long as they can get a job, they are prepared\r\n\r\nto  accept any salary.   But the employers  say these people are\r\n\r\nover-qualified,  they are very demanding and will not stay  long\r\n\r\nin  the  job.  So they do not even get a chance to go  into  the\r\n\r\ninterview  room.   A 51 year-old manager told  me  that  he  had\r\n\r\nattended  ten  interviews, and had  written  lots  of   letters.\r\n\r\nEvery  time  he attended an  interview, he could tell  from  the\r\n\r\nexpression of the interviewers that he did not stand  a  chance.\r\n\r\nHe  lamented,  \"If I do not go, I will have no opportunity.  But\r\n\r\nif I go, I do not stand a chance.  It is all the same.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the Government is the biggest employer. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should   take a leading role.   In  some  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments where there are a lot of backlogs to clear, let some\r\n\r\nof these retrenched executives and managers be employed to clear\r\n\r\nthe work.  They have the  management experience and expertise to\r\n\r\ntake on these jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Employees face the reality</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that all good things in life do not last\r\n\r\nforever. If you say this a  few years ago, not many people would\r\n\r\nbelieve in it.  There used to be long queues to buy the million-dollar  apartments  and  long queues to  buy  club  memberships.\r\n\r\nThere were long queues everywhere  because people believed  that\r\n\r\nwhere  there was a queue, there was opportunity to make  profits\r\n\r\nand amass a lot of money.   With\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  trend developing,  many people were using future money  to\r\n\r\nbuy  things that they do not need, just to impress others.  When\r\n\r\nthe  financial crisis hits Singapore, we all realise  that  good\r\n\r\nthings  in life really do not last forever.   We have to tighten\r\n\r\nour belts.  It is a blessing in disguise because it makes people\r\n\r\nmore  realistic  and  they begin to realise  the  importance  of\r\n\r\nupgrading themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so long ago, I participated in a dialogue session on\r\n\r\nforeign  talents and a young lady told me that the  taxi  driver\r\n\r\nwho drove her to the dialogue session spoke very good English.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found out from him that he was working as a manager and\r\n\r\nwas retrenched.  Since he spoke such good English, why should he\r\n\r\nwork  as a taxi driver?  We should find a better job for him.  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Well,  there are many taxi drivers who speak  very  good\r\n\r\nEnglish.  It does not mean that if one speaks good English,  one\r\n\r\nshould not be driving a taxi.\"  I actually admire the courage of\r\n\r\nthis  ex-manager  who dared to   take up  this  job  of  a  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver.   He is being realistic.  He grabs a job first and  then\r\n\r\nlooks  for something better.  Actually driving a taxi is  not  a\r\n\r\nbad  thing.  I know of many taxi drivers who drive taxis in  the\r\n\r\nday  time and at night time they enjoy themselves by singing  in\r\n\r\nthe Teochew opera troupe.  In the day time they work hard but at\r\n\r\nnight  they  go about enjoying themselves by doing  things  they\r\n\r\nenjoy doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, many retrenched workers are working as taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers.   Even  those who are not retrenched as yet,  are  also\r\n\r\nworking as taxi drivers, just in case they are retrenched  later\r\n\r\non. So it is good to have such a sense of crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singaporeans should try to upgrade themselves at\r\n\r\nall  times and get better trained to ensure their employability.\r\n\r\nIn  the  past, we said, \"A skill in hand brings you benefit  the\r\n\r\nwhole  life long.\"  But now with technologies advancing all  the\r\n\r\ntime,  your  skill may soon become obsolete when the  technology\r\n\r\nyou  are  familiar  with is  replaced by new  technologies.   In\r\n\r\norder  to  avoid  unemployment, you will have  to  possess  many\r\n\r\nskills in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhand  so  that  you can be employed all the time.   I  urge  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  have  this  habit  of  lifelong  training  and\r\n\r\nparticipate in the training courses provided by the NTUC and the\r\n\r\nvarious self-help bodies so as to ensure lifelong employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Foreign talents</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about the policy of attracting foreign talents.\r\n\r\nIn  recent years, the Government has been attracting  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nforeign  talents  to help in our economic development.   Foreign\r\n\r\ntalents can be divided into three categories. The first category\r\n\r\nof foreign talents are the specialists like the R&D researchers,\r\n\r\nthe computer experts, the medical specialists, etc. which we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have.   The  second  category of foreign  talents  are  the\r\n\r\nteachers  and nurses, etc., the type of people we are short  of.\r\n\r\nThese professions were very shorthanded in the past and not many\r\n\r\npeople  like  to be nurses, but recently there was a  change  in\r\n\r\nmind.   This  year, for the first time, Nanyang Polytechnic  has\r\n\r\nfull  enrolment  for the nursing course.   I  think  it  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause people change their mindset about being a nurse  but  it\r\n\r\nis because of the changing circumstances.  The third category of\r\n\r\nforeign  talents are those who are recruited to  undertake  jobs\r\n\r\nwhich  Singaporeans  do not wish to do,  such  as  bus  drivers,\r\n\r\nconstruction  workers, etc.  I understand  that  among  our  bus\r\n\r\ndrivers  in Singapore, some 40% are foreign workers.   We  issue\r\n\r\nwork  permits for people to do these jobs which Singaporeans  do\r\n\r\nnot wish to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When discussing the policy of attracting foreign talents\r\n\r\nto  come  to   Singapore, everyone supports the idea of  getting\r\n\r\nthese  foreign  talents here to strengthen our  economy  and  to\r\n\r\nenhance our competitiveness.  But now with the economic slowdown\r\n\r\nwhen  many  people  are  losing  their  jobs,  many  people  are\r\n\r\ncomplaining.   They say, \"Why are we allowing  so  many  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents  to come here?  Why are they called `talents'?   Are  we\r\n\r\nnot  talents ourselves?  Why don't you employ us?\"  In order  to\r\n\r\nimprove  our economy, to increase our competitiveness,  yes,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to employ foreign workers but we must also look after  our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  famous  poet Li Bai of the Tang Dynasty said, \"Everyone  is\r\n\r\nborn  a  talent.   I have my own niche.\"  I must emphasise  here\r\n\r\nthat  everyone is a talent, even a taxi driver is a talent.   So\r\n\r\nwe  must  make  good  use of talents and try  not  to  have  the\r\n\r\nmismatch of talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I suggest that the Government's policy on\r\n\r\nthe attraction of foreign talent be more transparent.  We should\r\n\r\nlet  everybody  know  that in each industry  what  are  the  job\r\n\r\nopportunities  available every year.  How many Singaporeans  can\r\n\r\nwe absorb and how many foreign talents do we need to absorb?  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, employers who are applying for work permits  or\r\n\r\nprofessional passes should consider employing locals, especially\r\n\r\nthe  retrenched  middle management people and executives.   Only\r\n\r\nwhen we run out of these local talents, then can work permits be\r\n\r\nissued  to  foreign workers.  The Government should also give  a\r\n\r\nprojection as to what are the jobs available, what can  be  done\r\n\r\nby  locals  and  what  are the vacancies that  we  need  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents to fill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already had the Retrenchment Advisory\r\n\r\nScheme and the Employment Assistance Scheme.  I suggest that the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower  publish the statistics of  how many people\r\n\r\nhave  applied for jobs and what are the job vacancies available.\r\n\r\nGive  some  illustrations to let our people  know  what  is  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  rate  of  our  job  matching  efforts.   I  suggest  we\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing  the  middle  management  executives  to   be\r\n\r\nregistered  too,  because  nowadays there  are  so  many  middle\r\n\r\nmanagement people or company executives who are retrenched.   At\r\n\r\nthe  moment,  many  employers do not wish to  employ  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers because they  feel that these people are more demanding.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, many people have lowered their expectations.  A friend\r\n\r\nof  mine  was  suddenly retrenched.  He told  me  that  when  he\r\n\r\nreturned  home  with  the  news of his  retrenchment,  he  asked\r\n\r\nmembers  of  his family, \"So, what am I going to do  now?\"   The\r\n\r\nwife replied, \"No problem.  Let us dismiss our foreign maid.  We\r\n\r\ncan save about $700 a month.\"  Then the daughter said, \"Well,  I\r\n\r\nwill give private tuition.\"  The son said, \" I am in  national\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservice.   During  the weekends, I can do some part-time  jobs.\"\r\n\r\nNow,  he  has taken a new job which requires him to  do  typing,\r\n\r\nfiling and all sorts of odd chores, and  he is earning only  one\r\n\r\nquarter of what  he used to earn.  But he said, \"Never mind.   I\r\n\r\nwill  carry on.   I will work hard and I shall survive.\"  So  it\r\n\r\nis  only  in  times of difficulty that you realize how  precious\r\n\r\nyour family is to you.  The family gives him the support he much\r\n\r\nneeded.    For  the time being, he may not be able to  meet  the\r\n\r\npayments such as income tax, PUB charges, housing loans, etc.  I\r\n\r\nthink the Government should be more sympathetic - allow them  to\r\n\r\ndefer payment or even to pay by instalments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the cost of doing business. We all\r\n\r\nknow  that  in  recent  years, our wage cost  has  already  been\r\n\r\nadjusted.   The  Ministers  and top civil  servants  have  their\r\n\r\nsalaries cut.   Civil servants have their bonuses reduced.  Many\r\n\r\nprivate  companies  are implementing the wage restraint  policy.\r\n\r\nSince  the 1990s the property prices have gone up by about 300%.\r\n\r\nThere  is a chain reaction.  For example, in a coffeeshop  which\r\n\r\nis tendered for millions of dollars, a chicken rice stall has to\r\n\r\npay  rental of $3,000 to $4,000 a month.   So let us think about\r\n\r\nit.  How many plates of chicken rice has the stall-keeper got to\r\n\r\nsell  in order to just pay his rent?  I hope that the Government\r\n\r\nwill give these property owners more rebates and we must see  to\r\n\r\nit  that  their tenants share these rebates.  Many  tenants  are\r\n\r\ntelling  me that up to now, they have not enjoyed any  of  these\r\n\r\nrebates that the owners are getting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays we have a lot of open-bidding exercises, for land\r\n\r\nsale,  for  COEs,  etc,  and  all these   tender  exercises  are\r\n\r\nabsolutely transparent.  The policy is correct.  But many people\r\n\r\nfeel that property prices can only go up but cannot go down.  So\r\n\r\neveryone  will start bidding higher and higher.  Now  all  of  a\r\n\r\nsudden, we know that the property price can go down and there is\r\n\r\nnothing  that  they  could  do.  In this  aspect,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should review the policy.  We should do away with the\r\n\r\nspeculative element so that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  will  not commit the same mistake again in future.  When  we\r\n\r\nare reviewing our policy, we should also consider the outcome of\r\n\r\nthe review so that everybody would benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry of Communications reviewed the\r\n\r\npolicy of diesel tax.  The saving of the diesel tax rebate is as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  $109 million.  The Land Transport Authority  makes  it\r\n\r\nclear  that  the taxi drivers should be entitled to a  share  of\r\n\r\nthis   benefit.   Recently,   the  three  major  taxi   operator\r\n\r\nassociations  in Singapore reached an agreement  with  the  taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies,  whereby each principal taxi hirer  shall  have  $750\r\n\r\npaid into his Medisave Account for the next five years.   So  in\r\n\r\nfive  years, every taxi driver would have accumulated $3,500  in\r\n\r\ntheir  Medisave Account.   In all,  $60 million will go to these\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers, which is as much as 55% of the savings  from  the\r\n\r\ndiesel tax.  In the past, whenever the taxi drivers talked about\r\n\r\nthe  diesel tax, they would become angry. They would  scold  and\r\n\r\nabuse. But now, they are happy.  I feel that this diesel tax  is\r\n\r\nno  longer a burden to them and the taxi drivers no longer  have\r\n\r\nto worry about their contributions to  Medisave.  This is a win-win situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this example we can see that the employer does have a\r\n\r\nheart and the workers have the incentives to work hard.  This is\r\n\r\na time for everyone to work together with one heart.  As long as\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  a realistic, pragmatic  policy  to  reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost, I am sure we would be able to overcome all  odds\r\n\r\nand come out of this economic crisis stronger and wiser.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin support of the motion exhorting the Government and the people\r\n\r\nto  rally  together  so  that Singapore will  emerge  from  this\r\n\r\nregional crisis even more competitive and resilient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a strong, able and honest Government in Singapore is\r\n\r\nnecessary  under any circumstance.  But it is not  a  sufficient\r\n\r\ncondition  for the survival of our nation, whether  economically\r\n\r\nor  socially.  A resilient and equally strong population is just\r\n\r\nas important.  During this crisis,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  is  no doubt that the Government's role as a  leader  and\r\n\r\nfacilitator of changes is crucial to Singapore's ability to  not\r\n\r\njust survive the crisis, but also to emerge the stronger for it.\r\n\r\nTo   do   so,   Singaporeans  should  support   the   Government\r\n\r\nconstructively  and  should not despair nor  be  overwhelmed  by\r\n\r\npessimism.  Sir, the Government should rally the people  in  the\r\n\r\nfollowing ways:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, view challenges collectively. Reflecting on our\r\n\r\nown  past, as we struggled through the last three decades, there\r\n\r\ncan  be no denial that both the Government and the people worked\r\n\r\nhand-in-hand  as  there  was a sense of ownership  of  a  common\r\n\r\ndestiny  and  a  common  vision.  There was  mutual  trust  that\r\n\r\neveryone  would strive towards the common good.   This  did  not\r\n\r\nmean that there was no suffering, no pain nor adjustments.   But\r\n\r\nit  did mean that everyone was prepared to work towards a longer\r\n\r\nterm  goal  even  though there was going to be hardship  in  the\r\n\r\ninterim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was again evident as we rode out the downturn in the\r\n\r\nmid-80s.   Painful  decisions were taken.  Singaporeans  rallied\r\n\r\nbehind  this Government and we emerged better able to tap growth\r\n\r\npotential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The financial and economic crisis that we are now\r\n\r\nconfronted  with  has  no  precedent.   It  has  hit  all  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries  with such ferocity that it would be quite  impossible\r\n\r\nto  be spared.  Even though we have a relatively sound financial\r\n\r\nsystem  and  competitive business infrastructure, we  are  still\r\n\r\nadversely affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates on how long this crisis will plague us have not\r\n\r\nbeen  encouraging.   This means that for us  in  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\npain,  particularly from unemployment and extremely  challenging\r\n\r\nbusiness conditions, is likely to intensify over the next  year.\r\n\r\nHow  we  react to this monumental crisis will determine  how  we\r\n\r\nwill fare in the medium, if not, longer term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current crisis resembles a mighty earthquake, which\r\n\r\nunfortunately has many epi-centres within the Asian region, each\r\n\r\ncapable of triggering equally damaging aftershocks.  The role of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment is therefore to help prepare people to cope with  the\r\n\r\ndevastating effects and we have to recognise that there is  very\r\n\r\nlittle,  if at all, that it can do to prevent another aftershock\r\n\r\nfrom happening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we cope with this crisis? Do we begin by\r\n\r\nshifting  blame,  say,  to  our  employees  or  the  Government?\r\n\r\nUnderstandably, this may be a reaction triggered by despair  for\r\n\r\nthose  who have been retrenched, or badly affected by the plunge\r\n\r\nin  property or stock market values, or financially crippled  by\r\n\r\nhigher interest rates.  However, once we start drawing lines  of\r\n\r\ndivision and forming separate camps, we will not be able  to  be\r\n\r\non top of the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaction to the current call to stay employable may be a\r\n\r\ngood   illustration  of  how  we  can  view  these   challenges,\r\n\r\nliterally, as one people or as different parties.  Do we see the\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  constantly  trained and upgraded  as  a  necessary\r\n\r\nsurvival skill for all Singaporeans or is it simply an end  unto\r\n\r\nitself, the road to another job?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we see training as an obligation of employers or the\r\n\r\nGovernment, then the motivation to get trained will not be  high\r\n\r\nnor  sustainable.   However,  if we  see  this  as  a  means  to\r\n\r\nremaining  employable, on account of our continual upgrading  of\r\n\r\nskills,  then we will fully realise the benefits of the  various\r\n\r\nschemes  put  in place by employers, unions and the  Government.\r\n\r\nAs  Mr  Lim  Swee  Say has elaborated, a change  of  mindset  is\r\n\r\ncrucial  at this stage, otherwise those who have been retrenched\r\n\r\nand  who  have  gone  onto training schemes,  will  emerge  more\r\n\r\ndisappointed, when they are still unable to find jobs.   In  the\r\n\r\nfinal  analysis,  our sustainable edge will be knowledge-driven,\r\n\r\nwhich  implies that Singaporeans would always have to be  ahead.\r\n\r\nThis is only possible if we constantly upgrade ourselves for our\r\n\r\nown  sake.   The  Government should help by  constantly  raising\r\n\r\nawareness  amongst the workforce and companies of  the  changing\r\n\r\nskill-sets needed over time.  More incentives for individuals to\r\n\r\nupgrade themselves should also be made available.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, be prepared to make adjustments. We feel\r\n\r\nhelpless or even frustrated when we have just been retrenched or\r\n\r\nhave  failed  to  find a similar-paying job for  the  last  nine\r\n\r\nmonths.   But, we should all ask ourselves the question -  whose\r\n\r\nresponsibility is it to secure jobs for us?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhat, ironically, the very same factor, that is, a\r\n\r\ntight  labour market, which has led to strong income  growth  in\r\n\r\nthe  past decade, is also the cause of our mental unpreparedness\r\n\r\nin  coping  with unemployment during this crisis.   To  a  large\r\n\r\nextent,  this reflects our vulnerability as an economy  with  no\r\n\r\nnatural  resources and one which is so dependent  on  the  human\r\n\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government agencies, such as the Economic Development\r\n\r\nBoard,  slog  hard to garner foreign investments which  will  in\r\n\r\nturn create jobs for us.  This has been accompanied by judicious\r\n\r\nmanpower  planning  for  the  necessary  skills.   So  far,  the\r\n\r\nmatching has worked well, which has made job placement a  fairly\r\n\r\nstraightforward,  if  not easy, task for employees.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  sense of competition for jobs and the need to make  oneself\r\n\r\npresentable,  skill-wise especially, is seldom  felt.   This  is\r\n\r\nperhaps our greatest challenge - to understand the need to  stay\r\n\r\nrelevant and flexible at all times, so that in trying times such\r\n\r\nas  these, we can make the necessary adjustments, both  mentally\r\n\r\nand physically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is therefore not an issue of what else the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should be doing to reduce unemployment.   Certainly,\r\n\r\nthere is no question that the Government should drive retraining\r\n\r\nefforts, with the necessary funding and placement assistance, to\r\n\r\nhelp those who are seeking to stay employable.  But the response\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans  must  be compatible in  order  for  the  whole\r\n\r\nexercise to be a constructive one.  For example, as Mr Lim  Swee\r\n\r\nSay  has  alluded to, Singaporeans have, justifiably, called  on\r\n\r\nthe  Government to reduce reliance on foreign labour and  divert\r\n\r\njobs  to  locals  instead,  in  a  bid  to  lower  unemployment.\r\n\r\nHowever,  will there be enough Singaporeans to fill these  jobs,\r\n\r\nfor example, in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  construction  industry?  So the question  really  is:  will\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   be   prepared  to  make  adjustments   to   their\r\n\r\nexpectations and take on jobs which may not always be ideal  but\r\n\r\nwhich  will  nonetheless  reduce unemployment  and  the  related\r\n\r\nfinancial problems?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, do not allow pessimism to overwhelm us. Daily\r\n\r\nheadlines just do not make for pleasant reading nowadays -  they\r\n\r\nmerely  reinforce  some of our greatest  fears  that  the  whole\r\n\r\nregion  is  plunging into a recession.  Acknowledging how  badly\r\n\r\neven  the  Singapore economy has deteriorated is  necessary  and\r\n\r\npainful, but we should try to look beyond this crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not allow pessimism to drag us down the economic\r\n\r\nspiral.  For we are a small economy and if we continue to wallow\r\n\r\nin   self-pity,  we  will  miss  out  on  the  opportunities  to\r\n\r\nreposition ourselves.  We should try to resist the temptation to\r\n\r\npour  our reserves into repairing depressed sectors per se,  but\r\n\r\nto instead focus on how we can deploy them towards consolidating\r\n\r\nour position economically.  This would have favourable long-term\r\n\r\nimplications and will help ensure that we have sufficient growth\r\n\r\nimpetus beyond this crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there is feedback that many Singaporeans feel\r\n\r\nthat  instead of pledging the $5 billion to Indonesia  as  trade\r\n\r\nfinancing  assistance, the Government should redirect  this  sum\r\n\r\ntowards  helping  Singaporean companies that  are  going  under.\r\n\r\nThis  is perhaps a good example of how difficult it is to strike\r\n\r\na  balance between competing demands.  Ultimately, what  is  the\r\n\r\nswinging  factor  has  to  be  the longer  term  value  of  each\r\n\r\ncompeting  course  of  action, for we  have  limited  resources.\r\n\r\nSeeking  the  Government's assistance to avert bankruptcy  or  a\r\n\r\nshake-out  may  seem  to  be  a  perfectly  reasonable  request.\r\n\r\nDeciding  which  companies  or individuals  to  help,  and  help\r\n\r\nconstructively,   is  however  extremely   difficult.    It   is\r\n\r\ninevitable  that some may drop out of the economy in the  course\r\n\r\nof  this downturn, and this is something which is of course hard\r\n\r\nto accept.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this economic crisis is both a test of political\r\n\r\nleadership  and the robustness of Singaporeans.   It  calls  for\r\n\r\nmutual trust and assurance that all parties, the Government, the\r\n\r\neconomic sector and the population at large, will respond  in  a\r\n\r\nresponsible  manner.  Whilst the Government should  continue  to\r\n\r\nshow empathy, Singaporeans should be prepared to endure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt in my mind that only when Singaporeans\r\n\r\nrally  behind the Government and make the necessary adjustments,\r\n\r\ncan  we  all cope with this crisis, emerge more cohesive, better\r\n\r\nprepared  to  tackle new challenges and realise  further  growth\r\n\r\npotential.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rallying point for\r\n\r\na  country  in times of crisis must be the political leadership.\r\n\r\nThe  Government must lead and must be seen to be leading in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  alleviating the hardship  and  in  the  process  of\r\n\r\nrestructuring.  In the midst of pessimism, the Government  needs\r\n\r\nto  encourage.   Where people are disheartened,  the  Government\r\n\r\nneeds  to  inspire. Where people are suffering,  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould show that it cares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the motion that the Government can act in\r\n\r\nthree  ways.  It can take short-term measures, it can take long-term  measures, and it can rally the people.  First, the  short-term  measures.  I think the Government faces a genuine dilemma.\r\n\r\nNobody, not even our competent Government, can tell how long and\r\n\r\nhow severe the downturn will be.  It depends on a whole host  of\r\n\r\nexternal factors, Japan, China, US, Indonesia, and so  on.   And\r\n\r\non  top  of  that,  the relatively painless  measures  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can take are limited in effectiveness and  in  scope.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the  traditional pump priming measures,  such  as\r\n\r\nincreases in public sector spending and even temporary  cuts  in\r\n\r\nincome  tax  and GST have limited effect because  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  is  so externally driven.  In 1986, for example,  there\r\n\r\nwas  a 25% income tax rebate.  This time around, because 70%  of\r\n\r\nthe people do not pay income tax, the effectiveness of an income\r\n\r\ntax rebate is therefore limited.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about policies to cut business cost? The problem is\r\n\r\nthat  every  levy  or charge has its specific  micro  allocation\r\n\r\nobjective   and  reducing  these  charges  would   disrupt   the\r\n\r\nattainment of these allocated goals.  This applies, for example,\r\n\r\nto  the  foreign worker levy which is used to discourage use  of\r\n\r\nunskilled foreign workers, ERP charges which discourage  use  of\r\n\r\ncertain  roads and utility charges.  Even lowering the corporate\r\n\r\nincome  tax would be useful only for those companies  which  pay\r\n\r\ntax  and is irrelevant for those suffering losses or those  with\r\n\r\npioneer status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Difficult though this message of limited effectiveness is,\r\n\r\nI  think  that  it is important for all sectors,  including  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community, to understand and to accept  this.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant for the business community to expect neither  bailouts\r\n\r\nnor  handouts.   In my view, the $2 billion off-Budget  measures\r\n\r\nannounced  in June are appropriate and sufficient for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing.   However, as the downturn gets worse in  the  future,  a\r\n\r\nfurther  round  of  off-Budget measures would  be  needed.   The\r\n\r\ntiming of the second round is all important.  It should be early\r\n\r\nenough and large enough to have an impact.  The action should be\r\n\r\ndecisive and strong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the second round of measures should include\r\n\r\nsome of the policy options mentioned above.  They may not be  as\r\n\r\neffective as we would like.  However, in times of crisis, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  just the hard and fast numbers which count.  Confidence  is\r\n\r\nall important and signals an impact that can extend beyond their\r\n\r\nactual dollar value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we may have to face the harsh and painful reality that\r\n\r\nwhat would have the most direct impact on business costs is  the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  labour costs.  The variable  component  of  wages\r\n\r\nwhich constituted 16% of total annual wages last year should  be\r\n\r\nthe  first  to  go.  Furthermore, in my view, the public  sector\r\n\r\nshould carefully consider what annual variable component  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  give in December, if any, and announce this early  in\r\n\r\norder  to send a signal to other employers.  And then, there  is\r\n\r\nthe CPF.  Considering that more than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n100,000 households are already withdrawing the maximum allowable\r\n\r\nfrom the CPF for housing loan payment, a CPF cut should only  be\r\n\r\nused  as a last resort and, even then, should be accompanied  by\r\n\r\nmeans to help those with loan repayment difficulties.  And  this\r\n\r\nis where, I believe, a compassionate Government should chip in - the  realisation that a CPF cut, or whatever cut, is  needed  in\r\n\r\norder  to  reduce labour costs would be painful, would be  harsh\r\n\r\nand would affect many.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the long-term measures. As Lim Swee Say has spoken\r\n\r\nat  length and very eloquently on these measures and I think  he\r\n\r\nhas  given us a very good lecture on the economic possibilities,\r\n\r\nI  shall  not elaborate on these measures.  Suffice to say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government can focus its mind and channel resources on  the\r\n\r\nopportunities and that we do not need to wait for full  recovery\r\n\r\nand  once  the region bottoms out, there are going to be  growth\r\n\r\nareas.   We  also  need  to  diversify  and  we  should  prepare\r\n\r\nourselves for these opportunities and be quick on the uptake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third role of the Government is to rally the people. A\r\n\r\nnational crisis calls for all hands to be on deck.  Everyone has\r\n\r\na  role to play.  Allow me to outline what I think should be the\r\n\r\nrole of business, workers and the community.  First, the role of\r\n\r\nbusiness.   I  have consulted a number of business leaders.   Mr\r\n\r\nStephen  Lee,  President  of the Singapore  National  Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation (SNEF) has said that he supports the motion.  He said\r\n\r\nthat  SNEF's stand is to minimise job losses.  In order to  stay\r\n\r\nafloat,  companies can agree to stop hiring, they can  agree  to\r\n\r\nterminate   contract  work,  cut  overtime,  cut  the   variable\r\n\r\ncomponent of wages and redeploy staff.  Retrenchment is the last\r\n\r\nresort.  But it is a legitimate response to save the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the role of workers. Workers must be willing to be\r\n\r\ntrained  and flexible enough to ensure that there is no mismatch\r\n\r\nin  capabilities.  NTUC's effort in promoting retraining through\r\n\r\nthe  SRP  and the Government's support for this effort has  been\r\n\r\ncrucial and timely.  It is also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nencouraging to note from Minister Lee Boon Yang's response  this\r\n\r\nafternoon  that  workers  nowadays  are  more  willing   to   be\r\n\r\nretrained.  Also, if workers are retrenched, they should not  be\r\n\r\nchoosy about job options.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, financial institutions also have a role to play. It\r\n\r\nis  understandable that they are concerned about  non-performing\r\n\r\nloans.   However, banks and financial companies should not  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of this situation to force companies and  individuals\r\n\r\nto  top  up  so  long as they are able to service  their  loans.\r\n\r\nAlso,  while  there is a lot going for the DBS/POSB  merger,  it\r\n\r\ndoes  have  a  negative  side effect on Credit  POSB  home  loan\r\n\r\nrepayments.    It  has  been  said  that,  at  current   levels,\r\n\r\nreadjustment  of Credit POSB interest rates to  the  DBS'  level\r\n\r\nwould,  for  a  20-year  loan, require an  increase  in  monthly\r\n\r\nrepayment of $92 for every $100,000 borrowed.  In other words, a\r\n\r\nperson  who  borrowed half a million dollars on a  20-year  loan\r\n\r\nwould  have his repayment increased by $460 a month, and  not  a\r\n\r\nsmall  sum  indeed.  Considering that Credit POSB housing  loans\r\n\r\namount to an estimated $7-$8 billion, the effect of this on  the\r\n\r\neconomy is not small.  Even though there is a grace period up to\r\n\r\nthe end of 1999, and the adjustment will take place over a three-year  period,  this  is definitely bad news for  the  mortgagees\r\n\r\naffected.   Could not the grace period be extended at  least  by\r\n\r\none  year up to the end of the year 2000 to soften the  blow  on\r\n\r\nthose who have already borrowed money from Credit POSB?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the community also has a role to play. During\r\n\r\ntimes  of economic downturn, there are those in our society  who\r\n\r\nare  genuinely  hit hard, families whose main breadwinners  have\r\n\r\nbeen  retrenched, wage cuts which eat into their already  meagre\r\n\r\nincome  and  so on.  We do not have a social safety net  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  unemployment benefits in Singapore.  But what  can  be\r\n\r\ndone  at  a time like this?  It is for the community to bear  in\r\n\r\nmind that there are those who are worse off than ourselves,  and\r\n\r\nto  continue  to  give.   The Government  should  also  increase\r\n\r\nfunding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor the Government and voluntary welfare organisations precisely\r\n\r\nso that they can continue to help those in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, where there is confidence that the political\r\n\r\nleadership can implement the appropriate policies, convince  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  swallow the bitter medicine and unite society,  half\r\n\r\nthe  battle is already won.  I would like to state that  I,  for\r\n\r\none,  have that confidence in our Government and I am sure  that\r\n\r\nthis  view is shared by many.  This is the time to close  ranks,\r\n\r\nface the crisis together as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise in support of the motion standing in the name of Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nSwee Say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economies of Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia have\r\n\r\nbeen  significantly affected largely because  of  inadequacy  in\r\n\r\ntheir  national policies, their political culture, their  crisis\r\n\r\nmanagement or mismanagement, or for many other reasons that have\r\n\r\nbeen advanced.  Singapore, on the other hand, despite its strong\r\n\r\nfundamentals and an able and honest Government, has nevertheless\r\n\r\ninevitably  been inflicted by this economic flu, or perhaps  the\r\n\r\neconomic bronchitis that has swept the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While other governments are scrambling around trying to\r\n\r\nsolve  their  economic  and political upheavals,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  begun  to  steer  its  course  to  address  the\r\n\r\nworsening  economic  downturn.  Despite its  efforts  to  reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness costs, the Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  come  under  attack  from some  quarters  of  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity.   But as economic analysts, like Dr Jim Walker,  have\r\n\r\npointed out, despite the clamour for more actions to address the\r\n\r\ncrisis,  the  reality  is  that  there  is  not  much  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can do to lift the economy from the downturn  or  the\r\n\r\nrecession that is looming.  The external factors, as Dr Lee Tsao\r\n\r\nYuan  has  pointed out, far outweigh whatever internal  measures\r\n\r\nthat the Government takes in the short term.  But the Government\r\n\r\ncannot simply sit out the recession or downturn but instead must\r\n\r\nplan   for   the   future  and  develop  Singapore's   long-term\r\n\r\npontential.   The crisis mode and environment present  a  silver\r\n\r\nlining for Singapore to strengthen its long-term competitiveness\r\n\r\nand social cohesion.  And by \"Singapore\", I do not mean just the\r\n\r\nGovernment but also the employers, unions and the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government on its part sees skills upgrading as a\r\n\r\nway  to  save  jobs and to restructure the economy  and  prepare\r\n\r\nitself for the knowledge-based economy in the 21st century.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  allocated  some $120  million  for  the  skills\r\n\r\nredevelopment  programme.  But the Government's role  in  skills\r\n\r\nredevelopment  cannot  be  limited  merely  to  the  funding  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  Presently, the NTUC, through its own initiative and\r\n\r\nto  its  credit,  has  taken centre stage  in  skills  upgrading\r\n\r\nthrough the SRP.  But only about 5,000 workers, out of the  more\r\n\r\nthan   700,000   workers   without   a   full   secondary   four\r\n\r\nqualification, have been reached so far.  This is even less than\r\n\r\n1% of those vulnerable workers in our workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NTUC, I believe, has got finite non-financial\r\n\r\nresources.  The strategy of outreach to individual companies,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand from the media, has been refocused to one of outreach\r\n\r\nthrough  the industry, federations and associations, so  that  a\r\n\r\nlarger  number  and  spectrum of workers can  benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nprogramme.   This is where I feel that the Ministry of  Manpower\r\n\r\n(MOM) should play an important role.  From feedback, I hear many\r\n\r\npeople telling me that the Ministry of Manpower is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperceived  as not doing enough and leaving the job of  upgrading\r\n\r\nto the NTUC.  This is certainly a common perception.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MOM must, like the NTUC, take a pre-eminent role\r\n\r\nin  worker upgrading and drive these efforts.  The MOM must move\r\n\r\nswiftly   into  action  supported  by  the  various   Government\r\n\r\nagencies,  the  NTUC,  the unions and the employers  federation.\r\n\r\nSkills  upgrading of the workforce cannot materialise by  merely\r\n\r\nproviding funding.  From NTUC's experience, the workers'  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  is  achieved  through a lot of  marketing,  cajoling,\r\n\r\ncoaxing,  perseverance and sustained effort.  The MOM  must  get\r\n\r\ninto the thick of action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, the Government disburses funds for skills\r\n\r\ntraining through some central funding programmes like the SDF or\r\n\r\nthe  SRP.   I  think  it is very timely for  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider  the much talked about CPF account for skills training,\r\n\r\nor,  as  some  call it, \"trainsave\" or \"skillsave\".  Introducing\r\n\r\nsuch  an  account  for workers now has got two main  advantages.\r\n\r\nOne  is  that it will make available funding directly to workers\r\n\r\nto  embark on training.  It will have the advantage of the  push\r\n\r\neffect  on  workers  to  go for training,  especially  if  their\r\n\r\ncompanies are reluctant to send them for training.  It  is  just\r\n\r\nlike  what  NTUC is now trying to do, instead of  going  to  the\r\n\r\nindividual  companies  it  reaches  out  through  the   industry\r\n\r\nassociations.  But there may be many workers out there who  find\r\n\r\nthat  they  cannot approach their companies to go for  training.\r\n\r\nHaving  an account like this will make it possible for  them  to\r\n\r\ndirectly  join some of these programmes.  It will  certainly  be\r\n\r\nmuch  better to have this push effect than just the pull  effect\r\n\r\nof central funding for the programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why this should be done is that there has\r\n\r\nbeen  much  discussion on the possibilities  of  a  CPF  cut  if\r\n\r\nSingapore goes into a recession.  A CPF training account  top-up\r\n\r\nscheme of sorts will send the right signal on the importance  of\r\n\r\nskills training to workers and help show alternate directions to\r\n\r\nworkers who are facing difficulties, or who would face\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neven  more difficulties if CPF is cut.  So a CPF reduction  will\r\n\r\nbe well buffered by having a CPF training account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this point of time I would also like to ask the\r\n\r\nGovernment or perhaps the Minister for Manpower as to  when  the\r\n\r\nreport  on the CET 21 will be released.  It seems long  overdue,\r\n\r\nalthough  I believe that the Committee might have completed  its\r\n\r\nwork.  The report, I believe, will provide insights as to how we\r\n\r\ncan develop a comprehensive framework and action plan which will\r\n\r\nhelp turn the economic slow- down into an opportunity for growth\r\n\r\nfor Singapore and Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the employers and workers, besides the Government,\r\n\r\nhave  also  an  important  role  in  shaping  and  strengthening\r\n\r\nSingapore's  competitiveness for  future  growth.   Having  just\r\n\r\nreturned to the private sector, after spending nearly five years\r\n\r\nin  the trade union movement, I deeply appreciate the respective\r\n\r\nroles  and responsibilities of employers and workers, especially\r\n\r\nin  difficult times like this. In this regard, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nurge  fellow  employers  not to use the excuse  of  the  looming\r\n\r\nrecession  as  a  first  excuse to shed  their  workers  through\r\n\r\nretrenchment or temporary lay-offs.  This must certainly be  the\r\n\r\nlast resort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies must embark on retraining programmes, such as the\r\n\r\nSRP  instead.  Many employers do not realise that it is  cheaper\r\n\r\nfor them to send their workers for training like the SRP instead\r\n\r\nof  laying  them off, retrenching them or having temporary  lay-offs.  For example, the temporary lay-off very often means  that\r\n\r\nthe  company  bears, say, 50% of their payroll  whereas  sending\r\n\r\nworkers  to SRP means that the company only pays 30% of  salary,\r\n\r\nsince  SRP  pays 70% of absentee payroll.  Therefore,  companies\r\n\r\nmust  approach  the  workforce with  a  medium  to  longer  term\r\n\r\nperspective  and use the downturn to train their  workforce  and\r\n\r\nnurture  in  their workforce a sense of company loyalty.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure this will pay off when the good times return.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the workers must also become more loyal\r\n\r\nand committed to the employers that they work for and do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  part  to  improve their work attitude  which  is  grossly\r\n\r\nlacking, according to BERI's findings, and the workers  must  do\r\n\r\ntheir   part   to  improving  productivity  at  the   workplace.\r\n\r\nProgrammes  like  the  NTUC's Productivity Push  will  certainly\r\n\r\nstrengthen  competitiveness of companies in the medium  to  long\r\n\r\nterm.   I  urge  the  NTUC  and  the  PSB  to  push  ahead  more\r\n\r\naggressively  on such programmes so that more  can  be  done  to\r\n\r\nenhance productivity at the workplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another area that I would like to touch on\r\n\r\nrelating to employers and unions' bipartite relationship at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace.   Generally speaking, the relationship between,  say,\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC  leaders and the top management in most companies,  is\r\n\r\nusually  pretty  good  and  cordial.   Somehow,  from   my   own\r\n\r\nexperience,  it  cannot  be said that the  relationship  between\r\n\r\nmiddle management and many of the branch union officials is just\r\n\r\nas  good.   There are many reasons for it.  But I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant,  at  a time like this, to close ranks and  strengthen\r\n\r\nthat  relationship  because  that relationship  would  become  a\r\n\r\nstrong  pillar  to  strengthen tripartism in Singapore.   So  we\r\n\r\nshould use this difficult period to focus on strengthening  this\r\n\r\nrelationship between the middle management and the branch  union\r\n\r\nofficials  so  that we can come out of it better,  stronger  and\r\n\r\nensure that tripartism will thrive in the beginning of the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions\r\n\r\nof Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TURNING ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN INTO</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OPPORTUNITY FOR FUTURE GROWTH</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  more  than 2,000 years ago,  the  great  Chinese\r\n\r\nphilosopher, Lao Zi, said in his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamous Daode Jing (Moral Canon), \"In calamity lies good fortune,\r\n\r\nand in good fortune lurks calamity.\"  The meaning of this saying\r\n\r\nis  that  good fortune is concealed in calamity and calamity  is\r\n\r\nalso hidden in good fortune. In other words, bad things may turn\r\n\r\ninto good things, and good things can also turn into bad things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past decade, when the leaders and people of many\r\n\r\nAsian   countries  were  complacent  over  their   unprecedented\r\n\r\neconomic  growth, it never crossed their minds that the calamity\r\n\r\nin  the  form  of a financial crisis was lurking   in  the  good\r\n\r\nfortune  of economic prosperity. As such, when this calamity  of\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis surfaced, they appeared to be caught off-guard.\r\n\r\nOf course, such a reaction is perfectly normal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singaporeans, we ought to be happy because we have a\r\n\r\ngood   and  responsible  Government.  The  Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nleaders  have  all  along  possessed a  very  strong   sense  of\r\n\r\nanxiety.   Even  in the good years when we had good  and  strong\r\n\r\neconomic  growth,  the Government has been reminding the  people\r\n\r\nnot  to take economic prosperity for granted, but to look at the\r\n\r\nsuccess as the fruits of our hard work and diligence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew has, on more than one\r\n\r\noccasion,   told  the people of Singapore to  \"be  prepared  for\r\n\r\ndanger  even in times of peace\". Therefore, the arrival of  this\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis  should be looked upon more  positively  as  a\r\n\r\nchallenge  to the Government, the business and the  workers,  to\r\n\r\nsee  whether  they could once again put the advantage  of  their\r\n\r\ntripartite co-operation to full play, pull together in times  of\r\n\r\ntrouble and tide over difficulties, rather than treating it as a\r\n\r\ncrisis per se.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In calamity lies good fortune\". Bad things can be turned\r\n\r\ninto  good things. This is an objective dialectical law  of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  history.   It  cannot  be  diverted  by   man's\r\n\r\nsubjective  will. As such, I strongly believe that  the  current\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis  will  be a  turning point  for   the  further\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Singapore's economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I support the long-term objective of the\r\n\r\nmotion moved by Mr Lim Swee Say and Mr Seng Han Thong, that  is,\r\n\r\nto  suggest  that the Government should make full  use  of  this\r\n\r\neconomic downturn to strengthen our economic competitiveness and\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion,  so  that  Singapore  will  emerge  from  this\r\n\r\nregional crisis even more competitive and resilient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the short-term target as raised by the two hon.\r\n\r\nMembers,   that is, to urge the Government to rally the  support\r\n\r\nof  the entire nation to minimize unemployment, I have no reason\r\n\r\nnot  to  support it, because it concerns not only  the  abstract\r\n\r\nmeaning  of  the standard of living of the people of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  also  the  actual  problem of the  friends,  relatives  and\r\n\r\nneighbours of each and every one of us here.   However,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  while trying its best to rally the entire nation to ensure\r\n\r\nthat   our  unemployment  remains  at  the  lowest  level,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  also make every effort to  ensure  that   the\r\n\r\nimpact  on  the  industrial and commercial sector of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nparticularly the SMEs, would be minimal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to make a rough analysis of the employment\r\n\r\nstructure  in Singapore, we will find that the vast majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  employees of the  five  major  categories  of\r\n\r\nemployers,  namely, the Government and statutory  boards,  MNCs,\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked  companies, local large enterprises,  and  the\r\n\r\nSMEs.   In the current financial crisis, all the five categories\r\n\r\nof employers are affected, without exception. But the \"degree of\r\n\r\ninjury\" varies.  The first four categories have strong financial\r\n\r\nand  resource  capabilities.  As it is said, \"a  lean  camel  is\r\n\r\nstill bigger than a horse\". Their injuries are just superficial.\r\n\r\nAfter  a period of recuperation, they will regain their strength\r\n\r\nand  vitality. As for the last category, that is, the SMEs, they\r\n\r\nare critically injured.  If they are not treated promptly,  they\r\n\r\nwill most probably succumb to their injuries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry conducted two\r\n\r\nsurveys on the SMEs this year.  In the January survey, 73.9%  of\r\n\r\nthe SMEs indicated that they suffered drastic reduction in their\r\n\r\nturnover\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand,   at the same time, 45.1% indicated that they had cash-flow\r\n\r\nproblems.   In the June survey, both figures exceeded  80%.   If\r\n\r\nthe  situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences  would\r\n\r\nbe too ghastly to contemplate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the other countries in this region are recording\r\n\r\nnegative  growth, Singapore managed a 3.8% growth in  the  first\r\n\r\nhalf  of  this year.  This is evidence of our strong and healthy\r\n\r\neconomic  foundation.   Yet, while we  rejoice  in  feeling  how\r\n\r\nprivileged  we  are,  we  must not forget  that  this  financial\r\n\r\nturbulence  has  in fact destroyed a good number of  enterprises\r\n\r\nwhich  could not withstand the impact, with many others  hanging\r\n\r\nby  a  thread  in a precarious position. Since the beginning  of\r\n\r\nthis  year, more than 12,000 employees have been retrenched  due\r\n\r\nto liquidation or down-sizing of their companies. According to a\r\n\r\nreport, by the end of this year, this figure would be more  than\r\n\r\ndoubled,  touching 30,000.  Apparently, we no longer  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nenviable situation of  full employment that we have enjoyed over\r\n\r\nthe last many years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary-General of NTUC and Minister-without-Portfolio, Mr Lim Boon Heng, recently told the media that if the\r\n\r\neconomy further deteriorates, the first thing to do would be  to\r\n\r\nsave  jobs.  And to save jobs, we must ensure that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nmarket  for the type of services and products we supply, and  to\r\n\r\nreduce  cost.  He also said that the Singapore dollar was higher\r\n\r\nthan  the  currencies of our neighbouring countries.  Unless  we\r\n\r\ncan reduce our unit cost, improve our productivity and implement\r\n\r\ncost-saving measures, Singapore may lose out to countries  where\r\n\r\nthe cost is lower.\r\n\r\nAt  another occasion, DPM BG Lee Hsien Loong  raised  a  similar\r\n\r\npoint.  He  said that reducing cost, including wage cost,  would\r\n\r\nnot  only  help  the companies to survive, but also  enable  the\r\n\r\ncompanies to be more competitive, thereby helping the workers to\r\n\r\nsave their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the spirit of the speeches of DPM and the\r\n\r\nMinister-without-Portfolio  happens   to   coincide   with   the\r\n\r\nobjective of this motion before us.  As\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  representative  of  the business sector,  I  agree  that  the\r\n\r\nbusiness sector should also try its best to coordinate  and  put\r\n\r\nto  full play the advantage of our tripartite cooperation.   Let\r\n\r\nus put in a concerted effort to lead all the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nin tiding over the current difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must emphasise that to do this, our imminent\r\n\r\ntask is to help the local large, medium and small enterprises to\r\n\r\nmaintain  their confidence and fighting-spirit to  persevere  in\r\n\r\nexerting themselves in their struggle for survival, for the sake\r\n\r\nof  their  own  business development and the  welfare  of  their\r\n\r\nworkers, so as to tide over the troubled waters and search for a\r\n\r\nbreakthrough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As employers, unless it is of absolute necessity and as a\r\n\r\nlast  resort,  we  do not wish to retrench our  workers.   As  a\r\n\r\nmatter of fact, we are even reluctant to cut the salaries of our\r\n\r\nworkers, including reducing the CPF contributions.  Because,  by\r\n\r\nso  doing,  it will result in reduction in the workers'  income,\r\n\r\nwhich   in  turn  result  in  lower  purchasing  power.    Lower\r\n\r\npurchasing  power will then lead to further contraction  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  The end result is that we, the businessmen, will  stand\r\n\r\nto lose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a vicious cycle. It will make our economic\r\n\r\nsituation turn from bad to worse.  Recently, the Senior Minister\r\n\r\ncalled  upon  Singaporeans to consume more.  I believe  he  made\r\n\r\nthis  call because he was worried that Singapore's economy might\r\n\r\nfall into this strange vicious cycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our local enterprises must reduce their\r\n\r\noperational  cost.  This goes without saying.   However,  labour\r\n\r\ncost  is  only  part  of the cost of doing business.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  if  the local enterprises can further reduce  the  other\r\n\r\nparts  of  their operational cost , such as rentals,  taxes  and\r\n\r\nother  charges, our pressure on labour cost will  be  relatively\r\n\r\nalleviated.   Lowering of labour cost implies that less  workers\r\n\r\nwill be out of job.  Is this not the short-term target that  the\r\n\r\ntwo hon. Members are seeking?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Government has already adopted some measures\r\n\r\nto lighten the burden of the SMEs.  We are not turning a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nblind  eye  to  all  these.  Indeed,  we  are  grateful  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  the various cost-saving measures,  particularly\r\n\r\nthe   series  of  off-Budget  measures  introduced  by   Finance\r\n\r\nMinister, Dr Richard Hu, in  Parliament on 29th June.   However,\r\n\r\nas  a  Nominated MP representing the interest of the  industrial\r\n\r\nand commercial sector, I am duty-bound to accurately reflect the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the  SMEs in this august Chamber, that is,  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has done seems to be not quite enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore entrepreneurs, big or small,\r\n\r\ngenerally  keep  to the excellent tradition of our  forefathers,\r\n\r\nthat is, they all possess the sense of duty and sense of mission\r\n\r\ntowards society and the nation.  With the zeal of \"what is taken\r\n\r\nfrom society to be used in the interests of society\", they often\r\n\r\nshare  the  profits they earned from their business  with  their\r\n\r\nemployees, and even donate generously to national and  community\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations, benefiting Singaporeans  of  all  races,\r\n\r\nreligions  and walks of life.  Of course, we have not  forgotten\r\n\r\nto  pay all the taxes and levies to the country, accumulating  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  surpluses for our national coffers.  Now, these  large,\r\n\r\nmedium  and small enterprises are subjected to the sudden impact\r\n\r\nof  the  financial  turmoil.  Faced with the pressure  from  the\r\n\r\nvarious  cost inflation and credit squeeze, they can be said  to\r\n\r\nbe  burning with anxiety and racking their brains for solutions.\r\n\r\nIn  this  crucial moment, if they are unable to receive  further\r\n\r\nsupport and assistance from the Government and the understanding\r\n\r\nand  cooperation of their employees, then eventually  they  will\r\n\r\ncollapse  and  have  no choice but to wind  up  their  business.\r\n\r\nThen, not only will more workers lose their jobs, the Government\r\n\r\nwill  also  lose tax revenue.  As a result, the entire  national\r\n\r\neconomy will shrink further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry announced the results of the second survey of this year\r\n\r\non 26th June, it recommended to the Government to adopt a series\r\n\r\nof pro-business measures in the areas of taxes, property sector,\r\n\r\nbanking  and  financial  sector, transport  and  communications,\r\n\r\nsupplementary schemes,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\netc. to help the local SMEs tide over this crisis.  In order  to\r\n\r\nsave  time,  I  will  elaborate on just a  number  of  important\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of taxation policy, we hope that the Government\r\n\r\nwould  adjust  the GST, say, from 3% to 1%.  This will  help  to\r\n\r\nreduce some pressure of the small businessmen.  In addition,  we\r\n\r\nalso  hope  that the Government will allow more personal  income\r\n\r\ntax rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the property sector, we hope that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will further revoke the anti-speculation measures for\r\n\r\nthe  property  market,  and to raise  the  CPF  portion  of  the\r\n\r\npurchase price to 90%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the banking and finance sector, we hope that\r\n\r\nthe  Government will relax the credit regulations,  and  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time try to adopt some measures to stabilize the  exchange\r\n\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of transport and communications, we hope that\r\n\r\nthe  Government will consider reducing the duties on diesel  and\r\n\r\npetrol.   At  that time, we also suggested that  the  Government\r\n\r\npostpone  the  implementation  of the  Electronic  Road  Pricing\r\n\r\nsystem.   But the Land Transport Authority has already announced\r\n\r\nthat they are going ahead with it.  It may seem inappropriate if\r\n\r\nI  were  to  raise  this  point again today.   However,  I  must\r\n\r\nemphasise  that if the Government discovers any negative  impact\r\n\r\nwith  the implementation of this system, it should promptly make\r\n\r\nsome adjustment to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of supplementary schemes, we hope that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  establish some special schemes  to  help  those\r\n\r\ncompanies which are facing difficulties in capital turnover.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, assist SMEs to explore new markets, for example,\r\n\r\nhelp  them  to  go to emerging markets in India,  Europe,  South\r\n\r\nAfrica and Latin America to look for business opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we hope that while the enterprises and the\r\n\r\nworkers  are  making substantial sacrifices, the Government  can\r\n\r\nalso make corresponding adjustments in its policies, and lead us\r\n\r\nout of this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"coldest  winter in the history of Singapore\", into a  beautiful\r\n\r\nand warm springtime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  thank  you  for giving me this opportunity   to  speak  in\r\n\r\nsupport of the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent regional financial and economic crisis can be\r\n\r\nsaid  to be the most serious one in 30 years.  Various countries\r\n\r\nin  Southeast  Asia  are  suffering  from  its  serious  impact,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  many  companies closing  down  and  many  workers\r\n\r\nunemployed.   There  was even social unrest  in  some  countries\r\n\r\nwhere properties were destroyed and many lives were lost.   This\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis  which has been  evolved into a  political  and\r\n\r\nsocial  crisis has serious undermining effect on the  prosperity\r\n\r\nof  the societies that have been painstakingly built up over the\r\n\r\nyears.   In order to avoid such incidents from happening  again,\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the  various countries are actively trying  various\r\n\r\nways and means to buffer the deterioration to the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various countries in ASEAN have manifested their\r\n\r\ncooperative spirit to help these countries which are in trouble.\r\n\r\nSingapore has participated in the economic action of the IMF  to\r\n\r\nsave  Thailand.  We have also committed a US$5 billion guarantee\r\n\r\nfor  the  letters  of  credit used in  bilateral  trade  between\r\n\r\nIndonesia and Singapore.  At the same time, we have lobbied  for\r\n\r\nthe  assistance of the United States and the IMF with  the  hope\r\n\r\nthat  with the cooperation of the various quarters, we would  be\r\n\r\nable  to prevent the economy from deterioration, with a view  to\r\n\r\nan early recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the moment, we are most concerned with the stability of\r\n\r\nthe renminbi.  Once the renminbi devalues, there will be another\r\n\r\nround  of  economic crisis for the region.  The economy  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of Asia, even that of Europe and the United States,  will\r\n\r\nbe  affected.  A regional economic crisis is not an easy problem\r\n\r\nto resolve.  It is not something which Singapore can overcome by\r\n\r\nitself.  We have to depend on the cooperation and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nassistance  of our neighbouring countries and the  super  powers\r\n\r\nfor an early recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as the economic crisis does not evolve into a\r\n\r\npolitical or social crisis, the Singapore Government should have\r\n\r\nthe ability to lead us out of the crisis. The economic recession\r\n\r\nin  1985/86  is  a good example of our Government's  capability.\r\n\r\nHowever,  all the people of Singapore must have full  confidence\r\n\r\nin the Government's ability to lead us out of the bad times.  We\r\n\r\nmust  stand united with the Government so that we would be  able\r\n\r\nto  resolve these economic problems together.  At this time when\r\n\r\nwe  are  facing an economic downturn, it is a test on the degree\r\n\r\nof  unity between the Government and the people.  We should also\r\n\r\nmake use of this opportunity to strengthen our social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as we are facing the regional economic crisis, our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries  adopted an uncooperative attitude in our\r\n\r\nremoval of CIQ from Tanjong Pagar to Woodlands.  They have  also\r\n\r\nissued some erroneous statements aimed at undermining the  unity\r\n\r\nbetween  the Government and our people.  This is very dangerous.\r\n\r\nWith  regard  to the background of the removal of our  CIQ  from\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar to Woodlands, the Minister has already given us  a\r\n\r\nvery detailed explanation.  I feel that so long as the policy is\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of the people, we should implement it.  So long\r\n\r\nas  the people and the Government stand untied, we would not  be\r\n\r\naffected by erroneous  arguments coming from outside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the country belongs to us. The Government\r\n\r\nis elected by us.  We should give the Government 100% confidence\r\n\r\nand to give it our full support so that the Government will have\r\n\r\nthe  full authority to deal with its foreign policies.  So  long\r\n\r\nas  our  stand is correct, the principles are right, the matters\r\n\r\nwill be eventually resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the imminent task before the Government is how\r\n\r\nto  implement appropriate measures to help the businessmen  tide\r\n\r\nover  the  difficult  times.  At the same time,  we  should  use\r\n\r\neffective ways to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhelp  the retrenched workers in securing alternative employment.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of  Manpower  (MOM)  has  already  provided  this\r\n\r\nservice.   However, MOM alone is not enough.  I  feel  that  the\r\n\r\nCDCs  and the community centres in all the 83 constituencies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  set up \"Employment Services\"   counters.   We\r\n\r\nshould  combine the resources of the Ministry of  Manpower,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Community Development and the CCs to  establish  a\r\n\r\nNational  Employment Network to help Singaporeans find jobs  and\r\n\r\ntide  over  the difficult times.  If everybody has a  job,  then\r\n\r\nsocially  we  will  have no big problems. We would  be  able  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a peaceful society and to work hard to get us  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  recession.  So long as we stand united as a nation, we will\r\n\r\nbe  able to take one step at a time to get out of this financial\r\n\r\ncrisis,  and position ourselves in better conditions  and  solid\r\n\r\nfoundation for our future economic development.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the motion. Sir, there are a few critical issues that we\r\n\r\nneed to address, especially at this time of our economic crisis.\r\n\r\nThis economic crisis has not been brought upon by ourselves.  It\r\n\r\nis  like  an economic haze because, as you all know, if somebody\r\n\r\nburns  a  forest somewhere, we are affected by it.   So  we  are\r\n\r\nfaced  with  this dilemma and many of these events are  in  fact\r\n\r\nbeyond  our  control.   I  hope that Singaporeans,  workers  and\r\n\r\nothers  would be able to see that these problems are not  really\r\n\r\nbrought  upon  by  us.   Many of these events  are  outside  our\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of this, it is very important therefore for us\r\n\r\nto  mobilise  ourselves and to rally behind the Government,  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions and the employers so that we should begin to  join\r\n\r\nhands and see how we can brace this economic storm.  Unless  and\r\n\r\nuntil  we  get  together  to  think of  effective  and  creative\r\n\r\nsolutions to these problems, I do not think we will be  able  to\r\n\r\nsurge  forward and find new solutions and opportunities to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that, at this stage, it is very important for\r\n\r\nSingaporean  workers, the Government and the  employers  not  to\r\n\r\nblame each other.  It is time that we should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nget  together and see how we can tackle the problems  which  are\r\n\r\nvery critical and crucial for us.  This is essentially necessary\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  time that we should rally and find  a  creative\r\n\r\nsolution  and band together to surge forward to bring  Singapore\r\n\r\nanother economic growth, and to try and find ways to reduce  the\r\n\r\nburdens that we will be facing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a few important issues that we need to\r\n\r\ntackle,  to  try  and  ensure that  we  can  keep  Singapore  as\r\n\r\nattractive  as possible so that people would want  to  come  and\r\n\r\ninvest  in  Singapore.  If we really cannot  make  Singapore  an\r\n\r\nattractive  and  competitive place, then I do not  think  it  is\r\n\r\npossible for us to solve the problems.  So how do we ensure that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  an attractive place for people to  come,  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  foreign  talents, or people who  want  to  invest  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  or  people who want to be educated in Singapore,  or\r\n\r\ntourists who want to come to Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an important issue that we need to address and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   must   examine  this,  that   we   all   have   a\r\n\r\nresponsibility that we all owe to Singapore, to try and see  how\r\n\r\nwe  can  work  at this hard time to find effective and  cohesive\r\n\r\nefforts  to tackle the problems.  Unless we stay together  as  a\r\n\r\nbigger  family,  I  do not think we will be  in  a  position  to\r\n\r\nweather the storm.  We may be in sixes and sevens and this  will\r\n\r\ninevitably  do us in.  So I urge Singaporeans, be they  workers,\r\n\r\nstudents,  families,  retirees  or  others,  to  come  and  work\r\n\r\ntogether  to  solve  this economic crisis that  we  are  facing.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of these problems are beyond our control, when  we\r\n\r\nband together, we are likely to find ways to meet the problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I can see, Sir, is that it is very important to have\r\n\r\npolitical stability, especially at this time.  There are various\r\n\r\npeople  trying to blame us for their problems, particularly  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian politicians, and many of them have recently said  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  doing  them  in or undermining  them.   Being  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry,  we want to live mutually, with good understanding  and\r\n\r\nwith good neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHow  can  a small country, like us, try and create problems  for\r\n\r\nothers?  We want a stable place, we want a stable Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nwant  a stable community, we want to have a stable ASEAN region,\r\n\r\nand we are trying our best to contribute to this.  Therefore, it\r\n\r\nis  important for Singaporeans to realise all these  issues  and\r\n\r\nthe  blames  on Singapore by many politicians outside Singapore.\r\n\r\nRecently,  Members  must  have  read  many  of  these  Malaysian\r\n\r\npoliticians blaming Singapore for their problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this the case? I do not think it is the case. We are a\r\n\r\npeace  loving people.  We are a small nation.  What else can  we\r\n\r\ndo?   We would like to live as peacefully as possible.  As  good\r\n\r\nneighbours,  we will encourage and support the interest  of  the\r\n\r\nwider  majority in the region.  I do not think we should stomach\r\n\r\nall  this bullying and blaming.  As Singaporeans, I am sure,  we\r\n\r\nmust be able to see the broader picture that Singapore wants  to\r\n\r\nbe   mutual,   supportive  and  have  as  good  as  possible   a\r\n\r\nrelationship with anyone who wants to bring progress and provide\r\n\r\na  better  life  for  all  within the region.   So  we  need  to\r\n\r\ncooperate,  and Singapore's belief is this.  All our workers  in\r\n\r\nthe  various  factories  and industries believe  that  the  more\r\n\r\nstable  the  place,  the more prosperous the  region,  the  more\r\n\r\nattractive  it is, the more stable the governments  are  in  the\r\n\r\nregion,  the better for us, be they Singapore workers, Malaysian\r\n\r\nworkers, Indonesian workers or workers in the ASEAN region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would urge Singaporeans to make sure that we do not\r\n\r\nallow foreign politicians to subvert us and bring dissent.  What\r\n\r\nI  am  very  concerned  about  is  the  possible  resurgence  of\r\n\r\nreligious  fanatics,  racial  fanatics,  language  fanatics,  in\r\n\r\ntrying  to  subvert us.  We will have to be aware of  this.   We\r\n\r\nshould ensure that we do not allow this to happen in the context\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's growth and development at this stage, because it\r\n\r\nis very easy to put the blame on racial division for an economic\r\n\r\nproblem.    We  are a multi-racial society and, being  a  multi-racial  society,  there  is always this  danger  that  you  have\r\n\r\nfanatical elements to assign the blame to various racial  groups\r\n\r\nfor their problems and issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that thinking Singaporeans will band together to\r\n\r\nensure  that there is progress, be they Malays, Indians, Chinese\r\n\r\nor  Eurasians.  We all have a stake in Singapore.  We should  in\r\n\r\nfact  try and see how we can work together and we should not  be\r\n\r\nallowed to be made use of by fanatics who are out there to do us\r\n\r\nin.  If we succumb to this whole thing, then Singapore would  be\r\n\r\na  broken  society  and we will never be able  to  put  it  back\r\n\r\nbecause political stability is a very critical issue for all  of\r\n\r\nus.   Without political stability, you can talk about economics,\r\n\r\nbetter  education  and  better housing,  all  these  will  never\r\n\r\nhappen.   If  we  do not manage this carefully and  we  are  not\r\n\r\naware,  we are all gullible Singaporeans, and we allow ourselves\r\n\r\nto  be  subverted and made use of, then we cannot put  Singapore\r\n\r\ntogether.   Because  once the setback happens  and  once  it  is\r\n\r\nexploded  in our hands, then Singapore would never be  the  same\r\n\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all thinking, well meaning Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  be Malays, Indians, Chinese or Eurasians,  should\r\n\r\nband  together to see what we can do to help Singapore  to  move\r\n\r\nahead.  We should not allow religion, race and language to stand\r\n\r\nin  our  way  because these are not the critical  issues.   What\r\n\r\nfaces us is the economic issue and we should see how we can come\r\n\r\nout  with  sound  economic  plans and  policies  to  tackle  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  I think this is very critical and essential for us  to\r\n\r\nmove ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second important issue is to have a proactive\r\n\r\nlabour union, workforce and employers.  It is important for  the\r\n\r\nlabour union, workers and employers to work together.  And here,\r\n\r\nI do not think we can assign blame on any of these quarters.  If\r\n\r\nwe  do so, we will be foolish because we will be doing ourselves\r\n\r\nin.   We  are  in  the same boat, whether you are  an  employer,\r\n\r\nworker  or Government.  Try and puncture the boat, try and  rock\r\n\r\nthe boat, who is to gain at the end?  Employers are not going to\r\n\r\ngain at the end of the day if they are going to retrench workers\r\n\r\nat  the slightest excuse they can find.  Neither can workers say\r\n\r\nthey  would want to have better salaries at this point in  time.\r\n\r\nIt is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvery  important for the three parties to work together and  find\r\n\r\neffective solutions to their problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that there is a need for employers, unions and\r\n\r\nGovernment to come out with strategic plans, particularly unions\r\n\r\nand   employers,  to  deal  with  saving  jobs  and   to   think\r\n\r\nstrategically  in  terms of ensuring that the  workers  are  not\r\n\r\nretrenched because many of these workers have served a long time\r\n\r\nin their companies.  Some have served 15 years while others have\r\n\r\nserved  20  years.  So I think it is important for us to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  workers who have been with these companies are  given  the\r\n\r\nbest.   We should try and see how they can be kept and, if  they\r\n\r\nneed  to be trained, we should find ways in which they could  be\r\n\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, many employers took the slightest excuse to\r\n\r\nretrench older workers.  I am very concerned about this.  I want\r\n\r\nto  find out from the Ministry of Manpower what steps are  being\r\n\r\ntaken  to  ensure that these workers are not retrenched  at  the\r\n\r\nslightest  excuse.  Many of these workers have worked  for  many\r\n\r\nyears  in the company.  When bad times come, instead of  finding\r\n\r\nstrategic solutions to deal with these issues, they find a short\r\n\r\ncut approach through retrenchment which is not a solution to the\r\n\r\nproblem.  Many of these workers have given their lives and  many\r\n\r\nyears  of  service to the company.  It is humanly important  for\r\n\r\nthe  companies to think of ways in which they could  help  these\r\n\r\nworkers  to be reorganised and find ways in which they could  be\r\n\r\nredeployed.\r\n\r\nSir,  there are also the other aspects that we need to  look  at\r\n\r\nand, that is, to see how the Government can also play a part  in\r\n\r\ntrying  to  soften  the  blow by taking a  number  of  measures.\r\n\r\nFirst, many of our workers are paying mortgage loans and we  are\r\n\r\nquite  fortunate that about 85% of them are living in HDB flats.\r\n\r\nI  want  to  find  out  from  the  Minister  whether  there  are\r\n\r\ncontingency measures to help defer payments and other approaches\r\n\r\nto tackle the problems of their housing mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issues that we need to look at are job placements\r\n\r\nand manpower plans;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhat  are the long-term manpower plans and how workers are going\r\n\r\nto  be  trained; whether these are in place and whether we would\r\n\r\nhave  to develop a comprehensive plan that can carry us for  the\r\n\r\nnext  20 years in terms of having an effective manpower plan  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  training and development  of  a  more  educated\r\n\r\nworkforce.   I  would  like to see more training  incentives  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  also incentives to enable  companies  to  begin\r\n\r\nreviewing  what training plans they can implement  at  the  work\r\n\r\nsite.   I  think  there  is  a need for  Government  to  provide\r\n\r\nmatching  grants for companies that are very interested  to  run\r\n\r\ntheir  manpower  retraining plans.   If  many  of  them  can  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to do so and they fit in the overall manpower plan, I\r\n\r\nthink  it is in the interest of Singapore and for Government  to\r\n\r\nsupport these companies to think of how they can participate  in\r\n\r\nthe  retraining of workers.  And that will help  us  to  have  a\r\n\r\nbetter   educated  and  well  trained  workforce  to  meet   the\r\n\r\ncontingency plans of the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also a need to look at how Government could\r\n\r\nsoften the blows of the economic downturn.  We could look at how\r\n\r\nwe  can  cut  costs  in terms of land cost, cost  for  rents  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  sites and other related things.  How can  Government\r\n\r\nreview, besides the current measures that are in place, the off-Budget  measures, whether there are some long-term  measures  to\r\n\r\nreview  how we can reduce business costs in view of the economic\r\n\r\nproblems?  Can we do this?  Can we take a bolder step to try and\r\n\r\nensure that Singapore remains very attractive in terms of  land,\r\n\r\ncapital  and  factory  costs  for the  development  of  our  own\r\n\r\ninfrastructure?   There have always been a lot of  arguments  by\r\n\r\nmany  investors that our land cost is high and, over the  years,\r\n\r\nwe  have become quite expensive and less competitive compared to\r\n\r\nother countries in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last area we need to look at is the training of\r\n\r\nworkers.   I am very concerned that close to 48% or nearly  half\r\n\r\nof our workforce are 40 years and above.  As Mr Lim Swee Say has\r\n\r\nsaid, we are moving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntowards an aging workforce and half of this workforce are  going\r\n\r\nto  be  aged workers of the future.  It has serious implications\r\n\r\nin  terms of productivity, in terms of rejuvenation of what they\r\n\r\ncan  do  and how they can be retrained, in terms of their social\r\n\r\nsecurity and their old age pensions. I think there is a need for\r\n\r\nserious  examination  as  to how we  should  tackle  this  aging\r\n\r\nworkforce and, despite the extension of retirement age, how  can\r\n\r\nwe  utilise this large number of workers who are in the 40s  and\r\n\r\nwho  are  going to be in the 50s.  There is this big  number  of\r\n\r\nthem and I think we should come out with a serious plan in terms\r\n\r\nof what could be done for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us will be in the aging workforce in about 10 years\r\n\r\nfrom  now, me included, Mr Speaker.  I am sure the Minister  for\r\n\r\nManpower  would  agree with me that this would  be  one  of  the\r\n\r\nserious  issues  that we would be confronted with.   How  do  we\r\n\r\nattract younger people into the workforce when families are very\r\n\r\nsmall?  We do not have enough people to come into the workforce.\r\n\r\nWhat  do  we  do and how do we try and ensure that  there  is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing  productive  workforce that will  help  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that, ultimately, it is very important for\r\n\r\nworkers,  for employers and for Government to band  together  in\r\n\r\nthese economic hard times that we are facing and many of us have\r\n\r\nsaid  that recession is going to be deeper in the next few years\r\n\r\nand we need to stay together as a strong family and Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust  find  ways  to  work together despite all  these  external\r\n\r\nproblems  that we are facing.  I think it is important  that  we\r\n\r\nstay  ahead,  we  stay  cool, we stay collected  and  we  remain\r\n\r\ncohesive.   If we are able to do this, then I think  we  have  a\r\n\r\ngood future, we have a good promise to be able to deal with  the\r\n\r\nhard times ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I would like to support the motion standing\r\n\r\nin the name of Mr Lim Swee Say.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch specifically on the issue of social\r\n\r\ncohesion  which  Mr Lim Swee Say and some other  speakers  spoke\r\n\r\nabout.   I  have no doubt that there is enough goodwill,  public\r\n\r\nspiritedness and national pride among Singaporeans that when the\r\n\r\ncrunch  comes, I am confident that Singaporeans would be willing\r\n\r\nto  do  whatever they can to help one another.  But I am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat  we  do it too late and wait for the worst of the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation to hit us before we do something.  We have seen how in\r\n\r\nThailand and Korea, people give up their jewellery and  gold  in\r\n\r\norder  to  save  the country.  And we have seen  starvation  and\r\n\r\nhunger in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in Singapore the situation is not as bad, never have\r\n\r\nI known more people, including my friends and acquaintances, who\r\n\r\nhave either lost their jobs or risk losing one.  I have known of\r\n\r\nfamilies who have to take the painful decision of having to  cut\r\n\r\ntheir children's tuition because they have suffered, because  of\r\n\r\nretrenchment.   This is sad because I fear the implication  that\r\n\r\nwe  have on our children.  That is the reason I think we have to\r\n\r\ndo everything we can to help buffer our children from the impact\r\n\r\nof  this  economic  crisis.  I therefore urge all  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nyoung   and  old,  to  start  doing  something  to  help  fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are in need of help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has stated that retraining of workers and\r\n\r\ncontinuing  education are important aspects in our  strategy  to\r\n\r\nprepare  ourselves  during this difficult  time.   Let  me  just\r\n\r\nhighlight examples of how Singaporeans can help in this  effort.\r\n\r\nThe Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE),\r\n\r\nof  which  I am a board member, recently organised training  for\r\n\r\ninmates  to  prepare  them to work as cooks in  the  hospitality\r\n\r\nindustry.   It  costs more than $50,000 to pay for trainers  and\r\n\r\ntutors  for  the 17 inmates.  Despite the slowdown  in  business\r\n\r\nfaced  by  many  hotels,  SCORE  has,  with  great  success  and\r\n\r\ndifficulty,  managed to secure sponsorship for  these  trainees.\r\n\r\nBut  I think we could have done better and train more people  if\r\n\r\nmore  qualified  Singaporeans are prepared to come  forward  and\r\n\r\ntrain these people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is times like this that we must ensure that every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  counts  and  be  an important  contributor  to  our\r\n\r\nnational economy.  Untrained and unskilled workers would only be\r\n\r\na  national  burden we cannot afford.  Even at the neighbourhood\r\n\r\nlevel,  Singaporeans  can  help  neighbours  to  babysit   their\r\n\r\nneighbour's  children, provide tuition at  the  various  tuition\r\n\r\ncentres  in  the  neighbourhood or even do  simple  things  like\r\n\r\npreparing  a  meal for their neighbours or giving a neighbour  a\r\n\r\nride  to  the office.  Simple things like this take  on  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  and significant meaning in times like this.  Everyone\r\n\r\ncan  help  and must help.  Whether you are a doctor  or  lawyer,\r\n\r\nschool teacher or taxi driver, everyone can play a part if  they\r\n\r\nwant to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that agencies like the Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Councils  and  the  National  Council  for   Social\r\n\r\nServices  set  up registers to match the skills of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nvolunteering their services with the needs of the community.   I\r\n\r\nnote the Minister for Education's call to develop what he called\r\n\r\nthe  people sector.  I really feel that there is no better  time\r\n\r\nand  no greater need than now for each and every Singaporean  to\r\n\r\ndo  something  for  their friends and  neighbours.   I  know  of\r\n\r\nfamilies where both parents with young children have to take  on\r\n\r\nan  additional  job  or  do  shift work,  leaving  behind  their\r\n\r\nchildren at home to look after themselves, to cook and to  wash.\r\n\r\nIn this example, a caring and friendly neighbour does help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current economic difficulty poses the danger of\r\n\r\nweakening  our  social infrastructure when people  become  self-centred, less caring and disinterested in things around them  if\r\n\r\nit  does  not  bring  immediate  benefits.   We  have  seen  how\r\n\r\ncountries   become   more   protectionist   and   nationalistic.\r\n\r\nInternally,  we  must be aware that our people can  become  more\r\n\r\nselfish.  This attitude cannot be allowed to take place  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  On the contrary, we  must rally our people to do  more\r\n\r\nto  help strengthen our social infrastructure and civil society.\r\n\r\nThis  is a calling to all Singaporeans.  We must ensure that  we\r\n\r\nnot  only  recover  from this crisis economically  stronger  but\r\n\r\nequally important is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed  to preserve and enhance social cohesiveness of our people.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  can only be achieved through shared experience,  good\r\n\r\ndeeds and good work amongst all our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion. We have so far been fortunate\r\n\r\nin  that Singapore has been hit by the regional economic  crisis\r\n\r\nrelatively   late  as  compared  to  our  immediate  neighbours.\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  Indonesia and Thailand are going to be in a recession\r\n\r\nand  possibly in deep recession, and Singapore cannot avoid  but\r\n\r\ngo  into  a  recession later this year, in my own opinion.   The\r\n\r\ndownslide should continue for another year or so.  We can either\r\n\r\nget defensive and become conservative in such an environment or,\r\n\r\nalternatively, we can be aggressive and consider  this  downturn\r\n\r\nas  an  era  of  opportunities to invest while preparing  for  a\r\n\r\nbetter future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the call from all the Members who have\r\n\r\nspoken  before me for the public, private and the people sectors\r\n\r\nto  work hand in hand to solve our problems as a team.  I  will,\r\n\r\nhowever,  focus my speech on what I feel we can do to strengthen\r\n\r\nour economy, both in the short and the long-term.  While some of\r\n\r\nthe  suggestions  I  am going to make would  be  appropriate  as\r\n\r\nBudget  proposals,  I feel that we cannot wait  for  the  normal\r\n\r\nBudget  cycle  and  they  should be  addressed  very  early.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore hope that we can take some more off-Budget measures to\r\n\r\nfurther strengthen our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some areas where I feel our fundamentals are\r\n\r\nweak, basically the fundamentals of the Singapore economy and if\r\n\r\nwe  can focus in correcting the problems, we will be able to  do\r\n\r\nmuch  better  than before.  However, if we do not  tackle  these\r\n\r\ninherent  weaknesses in our economic structure, we will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  take  the  full advantage of the next  upturn.   Worse\r\n\r\nstill,  we  may  face even worse problems in the  future  should\r\n\r\nanother downturn hit us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One obvious problem in our economy is the over reliance on\r\n\r\nthe  property  sector.  I refer the House to the Business  Times\r\n\r\nreport  dated  20th  July, titled \"The Perils  of  the  Property\r\n\r\nEconomy\".   I  fully  agree  with the  analysis  made  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economy,  just like those of  our  neighbours',  is\r\n\r\nheavily dependent on the property sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must realise that the property sector also impacts many\r\n\r\nother  sectors of our economy, especially the financial  sector.\r\n\r\nIt  was reported that the banks in Singapore have an exposure to\r\n\r\nthe  property sector of about $49 billion or a whopping  34%  of\r\n\r\nour GDP as of May this year.  And it is believed that this is an\r\n\r\nunder estimation, since the numbers do not take into account the\r\n\r\nloans  that are given to professionals, individuals and  so  on.\r\n\r\nIt  is  likely that the exposure of our banks could be close  to\r\n\r\n50% of our GDP.  By any account, this has to be a very unhealthy\r\n\r\nposition for any country to be in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is one area where all Singaporeans, including the\r\n\r\nGovernment, can learn a very valuable lesson.  We need to reduce\r\n\r\nour  dependence  on  the property sector  drastically.   In  the\r\n\r\nWestern economies, property is nowhere near the top in terms  of\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  economic  growth.   If  we  look  at  our  top\r\n\r\ncompanies  and wealthy people in Singapore, most  of  them  made\r\n\r\ntheir  fortunes through the property sector, while those in  the\r\n\r\nWestern  countries came mainly from value added activities  like\r\n\r\ntechnology and innovation.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, many companies tried to make a quick buck through\r\n\r\nthe property sector.  Even bus companies, food companies and\r\n\r\nothers tried to do so.  Even the Government, through most of its\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies,  too is to be blamed for adding to\r\n\r\nthe perils of our economy by getting involved in the property\r\n\r\nsector in a big way.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel that our solution is to defocus from the\r\n\r\nproperty sector and to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrefocus  on  more technology and innovation based  economy.   In\r\n\r\nSingapore we do not have enough large local companies capable of\r\n\r\ngrowing   in  this  area  other  than  the  likes  of   Creative\r\n\r\nTechnology.   I  urge  the Government to stimulate  the  private\r\n\r\nsector in this direction by creating a conducive environment for\r\n\r\nmore  technology  and  innovation based  economy  which,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  will be better able to weather a downturn if it  comes\r\n\r\nagain  the next round.  I also call on the private sector to  do\r\n\r\nlikewise to be more entrepreneurial in developing their business\r\n\r\nin   this  direction.   This  downturn  provides  us  the   best\r\n\r\nopportunity  to restructure our economy.  Sir, while  we  cannot\r\n\r\nbecome the USA, we could try to become the Silicon Valley of the\r\n\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the effects of the property economy has been asset\r\n\r\nprice  inflation,  particularly the high land rentals,  building\r\n\r\ncost  and  property  cost.  Being involved  in  the  electronics\r\n\r\nsector  and in the high technology area in the last 15 years,  I\r\n\r\nhave  seen  many  examples of new investments  deciding  not  to\r\n\r\nlocate  in Singapore or existing companies who decided  to  move\r\n\r\ntheir investment overseas because of the high cost being one  of\r\n\r\nthe  major issues.  The economic downturn has made this  problem\r\n\r\neven  worse with our neighbouring countries being able to  offer\r\n\r\nmuch cheaper land cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the off-Budget measures did try to address the issue\r\n\r\nby  offering  rental and property tax rebates, I feel  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did  not  do enough to instill  long  term  investor\r\n\r\nconfidence.  Permanent cuts would have been much better, because\r\n\r\ninvestors and businesses would see the rebates go away in one to\r\n\r\ntwo  years  should  the economy recover.  In   my  opinion,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment could take this opportunity to put in place long term\r\n\r\nmeasures,  like very clear policies on strategic  land  pricing,\r\n\r\nwhere a large cross section of companies will be allowed to  pay\r\n\r\nmuch  lower rentals for companies that we would really  like  to\r\n\r\nbring  into  Singapore, which can provide widespread employment.\r\n\r\nOne  other way is to give a 10-year tax rebate in lieu  of  high\r\n\r\nrentals  paid to JTC or HDB so that we can de-couple the  market\r\n\r\nprice of property\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  the  cost of doing business in Singapore.   In  this  way,\r\n\r\ncompanies  will  take  a  longer  term  view  of  investing   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also need to do more to bring in investments by\r\n\r\noffering  innovative incentives.  I must admit that the Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board is doing a good job here.  But there are  many\r\n\r\nmore private sector initiatives that could develop into concrete\r\n\r\ninvestments in Singapore and hence creating jobs.  We  all  know\r\n\r\nthat  our  neighbours are today able to offer exactly  the  same\r\n\r\ninvestment  incentives as we can.  In fact,  their  approach  in\r\n\r\nluring investors is to copy exactly what Singapore can offer and\r\n\r\nthen to offer a little more.  With their cheaper land and labour\r\n\r\ncost, we are definitely in a disadvantaged position and have  in\r\n\r\nfact  lost  a  number of big companies that could have  invested\r\n\r\nhere  in  Singapore  to them.  We  therefore  need  to  be  more\r\n\r\ntransparent and be more innovative in the type of incentives  we\r\n\r\ncan offer to these companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget debate this year, I talked about the need\r\n\r\nfor  us to promote entrepreneurship among Singaporeans.  I  also\r\n\r\nasked  for  a review of the bankruptcy laws, easier  listing  of\r\n\r\nhigh-tech  companies  on the Stock Exchange,  promoting  venture\r\n\r\ncapitalists  and a number of other incentives that can  help  us\r\n\r\nbetter  create an environment of innovation.  In his reply,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Trade and Industry said that his Ministry is in the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  reviewing some of these things.  I  feel  that  the\r\n\r\nprocess  needs to be speeded up so that we could take  advantage\r\n\r\nof the many opportunities that are available in Singapore and in\r\n\r\nthe  region.   We should not wait for the next Budget  cycle  to\r\n\r\nannounce some of these changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we need to do more to encourage our companies to\r\n\r\naccelerate  their regional drive and not to slow  down,  despite\r\n\r\nthe economic crisis.  Banks need to be more proactive in lending\r\n\r\nto  their  strong  clients.  Unfortunately, in this  environment\r\n\r\nwhere  tremendous opportunities to invest are available for  our\r\n\r\ncompanies,  and there are viable companies in the  region,  cash\r\n\r\nflow seems\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto be a problem.  Since our local banks are very conservative, I\r\n\r\nfeel  we  can  do  with  many more venture capitalists  locally.\r\n\r\nHowever, the incentives to some of the small venture capitalists\r\n\r\nare  not  as  attractive  as  those provided  to  the  big  fund\r\n\r\nmanagers.   Most  of these incentives favour the fund  managers,\r\n\r\nfor example, very generous tax cuts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government and the Monetary Authority of\r\n\r\nSingapore to review some of these rules and incentives  to  make\r\n\r\nit  more conducive for such boutique funds to flourish and to do\r\n\r\naway  with the bias favouring the bigger funds.  I feel that  by\r\n\r\ncreating such an environment today we will position ourselves to\r\n\r\nbenefit  the high technology investments that are going to  come\r\n\r\nour  way in a few years to come.  We could learn a lot from Hong\r\n\r\nKong and Taiwan in doing such things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I support the motion and feel that, other\r\n\r\nthan  improving labour cost and productivity, we  can  create  a\r\n\r\nmuch  more vibrant business environment that consists of a  high\r\n\r\nproportion of value-added activities while we try to  move  away\r\n\r\nfrom the low value-added activities like the property sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you,\r\n\r\nMr Deputy Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to support the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take the opportunity to add two proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that the Government should invest in and develop\r\n\r\nsocial  infrastructure.  During economic downturns,  governments\r\n\r\noften  adopt expansionary fiscal policies and invest in physical\r\n\r\ninfrastructure such as roads, schools, MRT lines, and so  forth.\r\n\r\nOur Finance Minister during last Friday's sitting listed out  in\r\n\r\ndetail  the  current and planned infrastructure projects  to  be\r\n\r\naccelerated  to  increase  public  spending.   These  are  hard,\r\n\r\ntangible projects which directly generate jobs and spur economic\r\n\r\ndemand.  The tendency is, however, to cut back on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvestment in social infrastructure, as these are seen to be not\r\n\r\ncontributing directly to economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue the contrary. Not only can investment in\r\n\r\nsocial infrastructure spur employment creation, but it can  also\r\n\r\nachieve   two   further  objectives.   It  can   contribute   to\r\n\r\nGovernment's efforts to retrain retrenched people in new  skills\r\n\r\nwhich 21st century Singapore will need. And, as we prepare for a\r\n\r\nlong  period of slow growth or even no growth, it can contribute\r\n\r\nto  the  social  cohesion which we will need  to  tide  us  over\r\n\r\ndifficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. For the past few months, MOM has taken\r\n\r\nthe  lead to develop numerous re-skilling programmes and to work\r\n\r\nwith  MOE to create a culture of life-long learning for workers.\r\n\r\nThis  focus  on  continual learning, training and  education  to\r\n\r\nenhance workers' existing skills or train them for new skills is\r\n\r\na  significant  long  term  strategic  measure  to  develop  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   I  also note that  DPM  BG  Lee  Hsien  Loong\r\n\r\nrecently identified the service sector as an opportunity  for  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive   infrastructure  to  be  set  up   including   \"a\r\n\r\nregulatory  framework, promotion strategies, and an approach  to\r\n\r\nattracting and developing manpower.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Government to also see the social services\r\n\r\nsector as another opportunity sector for development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social services community has drawn the bulk of its\r\n\r\nmanpower from\r\n\r\nvolunteers.  But while volunteerism remains a bedrock  principle\r\n\r\nin community service, there is a dire need for more professional\r\n\r\nworkers  to  help us deliver a higher level of  service  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   Recession  or not, Singapore  has  all  the  socio-economic and demographic characteristics of a developed society,\r\n\r\nand  if  we  study other developed societies, we can  anticipate\r\n\r\nthat  demand  for social services, and by implication  for  full\r\n\r\ntime  social  service workers, will increase  in  the  next  two\r\n\r\ndecades.  And I see a growing demand for more sophisticated  and\r\n\r\ninformed care which the market can respond by developing a range\r\n\r\nof job types.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for trained therapists, para-medical and social\r\n\r\nservice  workers to cater to the elderly, the chronic  sick  and\r\n\r\nthe  disabled, will grow as our society ages rapidly and medical\r\n\r\ntechnologies  increase longevity.   As a developed  society,  we\r\n\r\nwill  face  the pressure to improve services for the  small  but\r\n\r\ngrowing  part  of  our  population which  is  intellectually  or\r\n\r\nphysically disabled, or blind or deaf.  For the marginalised and\r\n\r\ncriminalised  population,  such  as  drug  offenders  and  young\r\n\r\ncriminals,   we  will  face  pressures  not  to  just   increase\r\n\r\ndeterrence, but improve rehabilitation and aftercare services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is that a lot more jobs at both the\r\n\r\ncommunity preventive and remedial levels are necessary  to  fill\r\n\r\nthe gaps in the continuum of services in this sector.  We should\r\n\r\nstop seeing them as social problem professions.  We need to  see\r\n\r\nthem  as people service professions which we must nurture within\r\n\r\na  comprehensive social infrastructure.  During times of crisis,\r\n\r\nwe  all the more need social engineers who are trained to repair\r\n\r\nand  mend  people's  lives,  and by doing  so,  they  strengthen\r\n\r\nsociety's competitiveness and resilience as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the amount of resources spent on economic solutions,\r\n\r\nsignificant  inputs must equally be spent on  developing  social\r\n\r\nservice infrastructure to reap investment returns not in  dollar\r\n\r\nterms, but in terms of social cohesion.  Social cohesion can  be\r\n\r\nthreatened  even  during economically good  times.   During  bad\r\n\r\ntimes,  the  lack of social cohesion can sabotage  all  credible\r\n\r\neconomic efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the various skills training or retraining\r\n\r\nfunds   be   extended  to  train  some  of  the  retrenched   or\r\n\r\nstructurally  unemployed  to  seek  employment  in  the   social\r\n\r\nservices  sector.   This is consistent with MP  Lim  Swee  Say's\r\n\r\ncall for maximizing employability of our workforce.  Here, I  am\r\n\r\nbroadening   the   call   for  cross  sectoral    employability.\r\n\r\nGovernment's  investment here will be both in the  provision  of\r\n\r\ntraining  funds and also in identifying sectoral needs  and  the\r\n\r\nprovision of social service jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it will be employment-generating, my proposal is\r\n\r\nnot  an ad hoc approach to just mop up the jobless.  In the long\r\n\r\nrun,  we  create new employment, and develop a manpower resource\r\n\r\nfor  staffing  the social service sector to address  our  social\r\n\r\nproblems.   Such  investment in social infrastructure  therefore\r\n\r\nhas  both short term and long term merits.  The workers who  are\r\n\r\npast  40  and who are retrenched are most suited, in my opinion,\r\n\r\nto  these  jobs,  because they are married, they have  families,\r\n\r\nthey  have lived life and they have learnt from the hard  knocks\r\n\r\nof  living.  This proposal is consistent with what Minister  Lee\r\n\r\nBoon  Yang  said  last  Friday that in  lieu  of  setting  up  a\r\n\r\nRetrenchment  Fund for workers, the more lasting measure  is  to\r\n\r\nretrain  workers and help them keep their jobs or  re-enter  the\r\n\r\njob market eventually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second proposal is for the Government to set up a task\r\n\r\nforce  to develop our own misery index as the first step towards\r\n\r\ndeveloping  our  own social security net or social  safety  net.\r\n\r\nWith  full  employment  and double-digit  growth  for  the  past\r\n\r\ndecade,  Asia,  Singapore included, never really pondered  about\r\n\r\nthe  social  consequences  of  unemployment.   Any  able-bodied,\r\n\r\nwilling  worker should be able to find some job, though  perhaps\r\n\r\nat  a  lower pay.  Now, we face the prospect of sustained period\r\n\r\nof  relatively  moderate  unemployment  by  western  terms,  but\r\n\r\nserious by our previous standards.  Government has long promised\r\n\r\nthat  for  the truly destitute, basic services such  as  primary\r\n\r\nhealth care, education and housing will not be denied.  This  is\r\n\r\nindeed a promise which many other societies cannot give, and for\r\n\r\nthat I am proud.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But beyond the truly destitute, there is a broad range of\r\n\r\nthe  poor  and  near-poor  who may be long  term  unemployed  or\r\n\r\nunemployable.  While we as a society do not believe in welfarism\r\n\r\nand its excesses as practised in the west, we do need to ask the\r\n\r\nquestion:  should we create a social safety net  for  the  truly\r\n\r\nneedy?   This, of course, begs another question.   Who  are  the\r\n\r\ntruly needy?  Can we measure this by just one yardstick, such as\r\n\r\nnet income?  My answer is no, because a chronically\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsick,  old  and disabled person with no relatives, who  earns  a\r\n\r\nsubsistence income is to me more needy than a young, able-bodied\r\n\r\nperson  living with relatives but earns zero income.  If  income\r\n\r\nis  not  the sole yardstick, then what are the others,  and  how\r\n\r\nshould  they  be weighted?  By the year 2030, we will  have  two\r\n\r\nactive persons supporting the needs of one elderly person.   How\r\n\r\nare we allocating our funds to meet their needs?  Is it time  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  an  elderly  welfare fund to repay  to  these  older\r\n\r\npersons who had contributed to the making of this nation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly believe that education and employment are the\r\n\r\nbest  welfare policies in the long-run.  But for pockets of  our\r\n\r\npopulation,  there  may not be available opportunities.   School\r\n\r\ndrop-outs,   single  parents,  the  illiterate  older   persons,\r\n\r\ndeserted  homemakers,  the  severely disabled,  the  very  sick.\r\n\r\nAmong  these, some individuals can still contribute  given  some\r\n\r\nlevel  of support.   The questions that follow will be to  whom,\r\n\r\nhow much and for how long.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to develop an appropriate social safety net\r\n\r\nwhich avoids resource wastage and programme duplication, we need\r\n\r\nto  define  a  \"misery index\" as it has sometimes  been  called,\r\n\r\nwhich  takes into account various factors to determine  who  are\r\n\r\nthe  truly  needy in our society, for whom a social  safety  net\r\n\r\nneeds to be constructed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, we get scattered data and signals from the\r\n\r\ncommunity on the extent of the impact of this downturn on family\r\n\r\nsituations.  Some hotlines registered a rise in the  numbers  of\r\n\r\ncalls  related to financial difficulties; a few social  services\r\n\r\nregistered  increasing petitions for financial  support.   These\r\n\r\nare  early  indications of the hardship but  we  cannot  clearly\r\n\r\nestablish  if they are due to the current economic  slowdown  or\r\n\r\nnot.   How bad off are Singaporeans?  Who are the casualties  in\r\n\r\nthis regional crisis?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Soo Sen this afternoon, in response to my question,\r\n\r\nsaid that between the years 1996 and 1997, there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwere only 41 applicants for the Interim Financial Scheme and the\r\n\r\nMinistry only disbursed $11,000.  Are we saying that people  are\r\n\r\nnot   poor  enough?   Or  are  we  saying  that  the  forms  for\r\n\r\napplications are too complicated that they have decided  not  to\r\n\r\nfill  them?   Or are we saying the criteria for the  application\r\n\r\nare too stringent, and maybe it is time to broaden the criteria?\r\n\r\nI do not think we know the answers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a written response to me from MOM, it was reported that\r\n\r\nout  of  80% of job placements for the retrenched workers,  only\r\n\r\n10%  accepted  the referral.  This says to me that  workers  are\r\n\r\nstill choosy and therefore times are not as hard yet.  So I have\r\n\r\nvarying impressions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proposing that we set up a cross-agency fact-finding\r\n\r\ntask   force  comprising  Government  statisticians,  academics,\r\n\r\nsocial  workers, and others, to conduct surveys to identify  the\r\n\r\ndistressed  in  our  midst, and to devise a  Singapore  specific\r\n\r\nmisery index with indices which are socio-economic in nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise that we need to be cautious, not to travel on\r\n\r\nthe  slippery slope of welfarism as practised in some  developed\r\n\r\ncountries,  and we must not determine social policies  based  on\r\n\r\ncompassion and generosity alone, but on principles of efficiency\r\n\r\nand  effectiveness.  We all appreciate the contingency  measures\r\n\r\nrecently  set  up by the various Ministries and  CDCs  to  offer\r\n\r\nassistance to people with financial difficulties.  A question  I\r\n\r\nwould  then  raise  is:  when was the last  time  we  thoroughly\r\n\r\nreviewed  our  social  security  schemes?   Are  these   schemes\r\n\r\nadequate?  As other ASEAN states are now studying ways to create\r\n\r\ntheir  social safety nets, is it time for us too to review  ours\r\n\r\nand  identify  new ways of providing funding and infrastructural\r\n\r\nsupport for the families, in view of the fact that this economic\r\n\r\ndownturn  may  well be the worst that Singapore and  the  region\r\n\r\nhave experienced in 50 years?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A timely and well-considered policy evaluation exercise by\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  in conjunction with social services  agencies,\r\n\r\nregarding  investment in social infrastructure as  well  as  the\r\n\r\ncreation of appropriate safety nets for our most needy, will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontribute both to our short-term economic recovery as  well  as\r\n\r\nlong-term well-being of a society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the motion moved\r\n\r\nby  Mr Lim Swee Say is timely.  It is a time of crisis, although\r\n\r\nI  do  not agree with some of the suggestions.  I think  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  through  an  economic crisis.  It is important  that  the\r\n\r\npeople and the Government rally together and come to grips  with\r\n\r\nthe problem and try to find the solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government can lead but it is equally important\r\n\r\nfor  the  people  to be led in such a way that they  will  reach\r\n\r\ntheir  destiny.  We are fortunate than many other rulers in  the\r\n\r\nregion  are  worried about their political  fortune.   Here  the\r\n\r\nruling  Party does not have to worry about change of power  from\r\n\r\none  man  to another.  There is political stability  here.   The\r\n\r\nbanking system is still sound and this, I think, is a credit  to\r\n\r\nour  political leadership and to the people for working hand-in-hand.  It is important for us, therefore, Sir, to see that  this\r\n\r\ninstitution  is preserved.  Many a time we take it for  granted.\r\n\r\nBut when we look around the region, we realise how fortunate  we\r\n\r\nare  for having a banking system that is sound.  Of course, some\r\n\r\nof  us  feel  that  the bankers are trying to be  a  little  too\r\n\r\ncautious in this period.  I would urge the MAS from time to time\r\n\r\nto  give  the  bankers some indication, that they  should  be  a\r\n\r\nlittle slow in enforcing claims.  Because I have heard from some\r\n\r\nclients  that the bankers are asking for reassessment  of  their\r\n\r\nloans, which they are entitled.  But unless these customers  are\r\n\r\nin  danger  of collapsing, I think we must not pull the  carpet.\r\n\r\nIt is very important for the banking system, the institution, to\r\n\r\ngain  the  confidence of the people.  I know that DPM  had  said\r\n\r\nearlier  that  banking is a private institution, and  we  cannot\r\n\r\ninterfere.   But  I think the Government can take  the  lead  in\r\n\r\ngiving indication as to which way the banking sector should go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Vasoo mentioned very eloquently about the spirit.\r\n\r\nI  think it is very important for us to have the fighting spirit\r\n\r\nin  us.  What I am a little disappointed with some of the people\r\n\r\nis  this.  There is some sector, and I give an example, where we\r\n\r\nsee very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyoung  able-bodied  men in early 30s, 40s, working  as  security\r\n\r\nguards. What is the pay?  $1,000, $1,100.  My work in SINDA  has\r\n\r\nled  me  to meet some of these people and talk to them.   And  I\r\n\r\nasked:  \"Why  can't   you be a driver?\"  He  said,  \"I  have  no\r\n\r\ndriving  licence.\"  I said, \"Why don't you go and take a driving\r\n\r\nlicence?   It  will  take  some time.\"   He  said,  \"Oh,  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult.  I have got a family to support.\"  All he requires is\r\n\r\nhalf  an  hour to one hour, three to four times a week, and  the\r\n\r\njob  is  ready in the market.  Similarly, a restaurant  man  was\r\n\r\ntelling  me  that he is finding difficulty getting workers.   So\r\n\r\nsomething  is  wrong here.  While some people are  losing  jobs,\r\n\r\nthere  are  other people who are happy with their  jobs.   So  I\r\n\r\nshare  the sentiments shown by earlier speakers that we must  at\r\n\r\nall  costs  tell the people that they must upgrade.  And  unless\r\n\r\nthey  upgrade, unless the productivity increases, they  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  succeed.   Here again, Sir, if  I  could  share  with\r\n\r\nMembers  a  classic example of how an institution  went  out  of\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used to have in early 1970s a company called the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction Company.  Who were its  rivals?   More  than\r\n\r\nhalf  a dozen Chinese bus companies.  They started with mosquito\r\n\r\nbuses.  I remember they carried 20 passengers.  But because  STC\r\n\r\ndid  not  know  how  to  change with the  time,  the  small  bus\r\n\r\noperators  merged  together  and took  over  STC.   It  operated\r\n\r\nthrough  a Charter.  It was guaranteed by the British government\r\n\r\nthrough a charter.  But it did not know how to compete and  live\r\n\r\nwith  the  economic  realities of Singapore in  changing  times.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  market was open, they could not compete.   Similarly,\r\n\r\nSir,  as  Mr  Lim  Swee  Say has said earlier,  we  have  to  be\r\n\r\nconscious of not only the cost price but we must be in position,\r\n\r\nas  our neighbours are going to have cheaper cost of production,\r\n\r\nand  we must be seen to be very competitive.  Today, I think the\r\n\r\nonly solution is through productivity and education.  There  are\r\n\r\na  lot  of  Singaporeans who do not even have primary education.\r\n\r\nThe  WISE  and BEST programmes must be worked to such an  extent\r\n\r\nthat they are all gainfully employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move to another related issue. Again, I would like\r\n\r\nto  draw from personal experience.  Over $60 billion is tied  to\r\n\r\nproperty.  Every young Singaporean wants to upgrade from 4- to 5-room  flats  to  Executive flats to terrace  houses.   There  is\r\n\r\nnothing wrong with being ambitious.  But let us have a sense  of\r\n\r\nrealism.   Can  we  afford at the end of  the  day  to  pay  the\r\n\r\ninstalments  in  case  there is a rise in interest  rates?   And\r\n\r\nspecially  so for those who have bought, let us say,  a  terrace\r\n\r\nhouse  in 1995 for $1 million, it is probably now worth $700,000\r\n\r\nto $800,000.  And if the bank suddenly decides to call back just\r\n\r\n$100,000, where are they going to find this money to pay?  So my\r\n\r\nappeal to all these people is to get their priority right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, through the Housing and Development Board,\r\n\r\nhas  built enough houses.  Nobody lives in the streets, save for\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  foreign workers.  We all have a  home.   Get  the\r\n\r\npriority  right  by  having  some  savings.   And  I  am  really\r\n\r\nsurprised  when  I see young people, husband and  wife,  earning\r\n\r\n$9,000 a month jointly, and they straightaway upgrade from a  4-room  flat to a terrace house.  Why must we be so much attracted\r\n\r\nby  this  private  property?  Sir, I  have  a  private  property\r\n\r\nbecause I could not qualify for HDB flat; otherwise, I will  opt\r\n\r\nfor it.  In fact, when I am older in my age, I probably would do\r\n\r\nthat.   There will be homes for the aged, I hope by  then.   HDB\r\n\r\nwill build them.  Sir, the question that we have to ask is:  can\r\n\r\nwe  afford?  I think this is where I would urge members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic to be very careful with these commitments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other matter is this. It is in times of crisis\r\n\r\nthat the community really is being examined, whether we are  one\r\n\r\nsocial cohesive unit.  As has been told by Mdm Claire Chiang and\r\n\r\nDr  Lee Tsao Yuan earlier, we must feel for fellow Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nI  am  not asking that if you have a whole loaf, give the  whole\r\n\r\nthing to him, but share some of the suffering.  Those of us  who\r\n\r\ncould  afford  to  share a bit of our extra, give  it  to  them.\r\n\r\nTalking  about  social cohesiveness, I think the Government  can\r\n\r\nfeel a sense of achievement.  Last Saturday, together with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMr  Inderjit Singh, I attended a function organised by the  Sikh\r\n\r\ncommunity.   Very young Sikh boys and girls, who  are  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  students,  were  singing  in  Punjabi,  songs  based  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's  national values, and I was really touched.   I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand a little bit of Punjabi.  Hindi is my mother  tongue.\r\n\r\nAnd I was really touched by these boys and girls, how they could\r\n\r\nsing  the  core values of Singapore.  Ten years ago,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  they  would  have  done it.   This  is  called  community\r\n\r\nbonding.  The Minister for Community Development was there.   It\r\n\r\nis  an  example of bonding of a community, small it may be.   We\r\n\r\nwere  told by Bhajan Singh, the Chairman of Sikh Advisory Board,\r\n\r\nwho  is  an educationist himself, how Sikhs have welfare schemes\r\n\r\nto help those in need.  I thought it is something we can emulate\r\n\r\nfrom them for the whole of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wanted to say many things but, unfortunately, most\r\n\r\nof the things have been touched and I do not want to prolong the\r\n\r\ndebate longer than necessary.  Sir, this is the disadvantage  of\r\n\r\nbeing the last few speakers.  Everybody has spoken what probably\r\n\r\nyou  wanted to.  But I just want to say one thing.  Whatever  we\r\n\r\ndo, we always must do, the Government and the people, and it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that Government from time to time consult the  people,\r\n\r\nnot  after  it has taken the decision and then get the  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people.   I think that is not correct.   Consult  the\r\n\r\nChambers  of  Commerce and the various professional groups,  get\r\n\r\ntheir  inputs and see how the policy is going to be  implemented\r\n\r\nto  help the community.  And I would say that the Government  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  because  the  Government always  consults,  but  its\r\n\r\nconsultative process must go for some fine-tuning.  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  from  time  to time to consult Chambers  of  Commerce\r\n\r\nbecause they are the most concerned people in this issue  and  I\r\n\r\nshare the sentiments of my fellow NMP Mr Tay Beng Chuan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I have some doubts on this motion.  This motion\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nurges  the Government to rally the support of the entire  nation\r\n\r\nin  this  time of economic downturn to minimise unemployment  in\r\n\r\nthe  short  term  and  strengthen economic  competitiveness  and\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion for the long term so that Singapore will emerge\r\n\r\nfrom this regional crisis even more competitive and resilient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, to unite all the people of the nation and to\r\n\r\nenhance  social cohesion and the competitiveness of the  country\r\n\r\nis something which a responsible government should be doing.  To\r\n\r\nemphasise  that  point  in this time of economic  downturn,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should unite all the people.  In moving this  motion,\r\n\r\nare  the  PAP  Members saying that the Government has  not  been\r\n\r\ndoing enough in this area?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, during the general election last year, in order\r\n\r\nto  win  votes, the PAP Government used the HDB upgrading policy\r\n\r\nwhich undermined the unity of our people and weakened our social\r\n\r\ncohesion.  Now the PAP MPs are raising this motion to rally  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  entire  nation.  Is it  an  admission  of  the\r\n\r\nmistakes committed during the last general election?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the focus of this motion is on unemployment and\r\n\r\nthe  economic  downturn.   Is it because  the  PAP  Government's\r\n\r\nfeeling  that  its economic trump card of urging  the  Singapore\r\n\r\npeople  to submit them in exchange for economic growth, for  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of wealth and for enhancement of assets is losing  its\r\n\r\neffect and it has come to a sudden realisation of the importance\r\n\r\nof  national  unity?  By right, the Government  and  the  people\r\n\r\nshould  work together.  This is something which of course should\r\n\r\nbe  done.   Yet,  during the election, the  PAP  Government  was\r\n\r\nunable  to share the fruits of prosperity with those who opposed\r\n\r\nthem.   And  yet,  at this time of economic downturn,  they  are\r\n\r\nasking  everybody  to  share the sufferings.   It  is  like  the\r\n\r\nEmperor Qian in ancient China who sought company of the ugly but\r\n\r\nresourceful  concubine when he was in trouble but  favoured  the\r\n\r\npretty but ineffective beauty when everything was fine.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all this, I would say that national unity and a\r\n\r\nstrong  sense of identity with the nation is the basis  for  the\r\n\r\nprosperity of the nation.  Although the PAP Government  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  kind to the people, in this time of crisis, I support this\r\n\r\nmotion to rally the support of all the people in the nation.  To\r\n\r\nrally the support of the entire nation and to enhance our social\r\n\r\ncohesion,  I  feel  that the most important  thing  is  to  make\r\n\r\neveryone in Singapore feel that he is a part of the country  and\r\n\r\nhe  is  being  treated fairly.  For the Government  to  get  the\r\n\r\nsupport of all the people, it should treat every citizen fairly,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  the  distribution of the  fruits  of  economic\r\n\r\nsuccess.   We  should look after the people  and  make  everyone\r\n\r\ntruly convinced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the PAP Government is sincere in enhancing social\r\n\r\ncohesion  and achieving the target of national unity,  first  of\r\n\r\nall, it must remove the psychological barrier that prevents  our\r\n\r\npeople  from  being  united together  and  should  consider  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  suggestions.  First, we should remove  the  political\r\n\r\nelements  in  the  conditions  for  HDB  flat  upgrading.   This\r\n\r\npolitical  factor is that when all conditions are the same,  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  support  for the PAP becomes a deciding  factor.   The\r\n\r\nimpression  given by the PAP in the last election was  that  the\r\n\r\nhousing  estates in the opposition constituencies will never  be\r\n\r\nupgraded.   I  think the Government should clarify  this  point.\r\n\r\nPAP  Government should also consider announcing the schedule  of\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  flats in all constituencies in advance  to  prove\r\n\r\nthat its deed matches with its words.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should amend the criterion for application of\r\n\r\nCIPC funds from the Ministry of National Development so that the\r\n\r\nopposition town councils can apply directly to the Ministry  for\r\n\r\nCIPC  assistance  in  improving the facilities  of  the  housing\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to open the MRT station in Potong Pasir. If they\r\n\r\nfeel  that  there is not enough volume of passengers, we  should\r\n\r\ndevelop the nearby areas so that the residents in the opposition\r\n\r\nwards  could  also benefit from that.  This will show  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  makes  use of national resource without  favour  and\r\n\r\ntakes care of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nevery  citizen and in turn expresses the Government's  sincerity\r\n\r\nin uniting the entire nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the Government should remove GST and reduce the\r\n\r\nvarious  charges.   Although  all these  suggestions  have  been\r\n\r\nrejected  by  the Minister, the Government should  consider  the\r\n\r\nfeelings of the people.  At the time when everyone is facing the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  the economic downturn, especially the  lower  income\r\n\r\npopulation  and those who lose their employment, the  Government\r\n\r\nshould respond to help by minimizing the pressure in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, the Ministers should volunteer to take a pay cut,\r\n\r\nalthough I understand that the pay cut by the Ministers will not\r\n\r\nhelp  to  improve our economy.  But when the people  are  facing\r\n\r\neconomic  difficulties, as leaders of the nation  the  Ministers\r\n\r\nvolunteer to take a pay cut, it will have some positive effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, the PAP Government should frankly admit that the\r\n\r\nprosperity and development of the Singapore economy is dependent\r\n\r\non  the  regional and world economy and not just on the economic\r\n\r\npolicies of the PAP Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the PAP will stop blowing its trumpet and\r\n\r\nproclaim to be the saviour of Singapore and assuring the  people\r\n\r\nduring  the  general elections that they will have their  assets\r\n\r\nenhanced  and their incomes will be increased year  by  year  as\r\n\r\nthough  the  PAP Government is omnipotent, they  can  solve  all\r\n\r\nproblems  and  help the people in every way.  This  resulted  in\r\n\r\npeople not seeing the need to be united in order to make use  of\r\n\r\nthe  strength  of  unity to help the nation pull  through  in  a\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier, to enhance our\r\n\r\nsocial cohesion and to unite our people, the important factor is\r\n\r\nto treat every Singapore citizen fairly.  The PAP Government has\r\n\r\nbeen using the national resources to distribute unfairly to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  inducing  and  threatening  people,  such  as  the  HDB\r\n\r\nupgrading programme, CIPC funds and infrastructural measures,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the MRT.  It has created a psychological barrier  that\r\n\r\nprevents our people from being united.  This feeling is not only\r\n\r\nin  the hearts of the people in the opposition wards, but it  is\r\n\r\nalso  something which has been disturbing every Singaporean  who\r\n\r\nhas a conscience.  The PAP should now realise that every citizen\r\n\r\nhas  its  own  contribution to Singapore.   The  PAP  should  be\r\n\r\nmagnanimous  to accommodate those who hold different  views  and\r\n\r\nthe  supporters  of  the  other political  camps.   If  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  such  a heart, I believe that  we  can  enhance\r\n\r\ncohesion, we can make all the people stand united and  create  a\r\n\r\nhome that belongs to us, our Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, on many\r\n\r\noccasions in recent years, I have heard many top executives, top\r\n\r\nbusinessmen,  educationists  and even  politicians,  complaining\r\n\r\nthat the long boom years have led to escalating costs, demanding\r\n\r\nworkers and lower productivity.  We should all somewhat  have  a\r\n\r\nrecession to moderate the untenable cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a tremendous economic slowdown or even a recession\r\n\r\ncoming.  Some people from the very same group complain and  they\r\n\r\ncry  foul  and  ask  for  help.  So are  we  really  hypocrites?\r\n\r\nAlthough this crash in East Asia has come too fast and too great\r\n\r\nfor most people to anticipate and be prepared, why are there  so\r\n\r\nmany  people out there who are affected by the crash?   Perhaps,\r\n\r\nwe  should re-examine ourselves and see whether we are all  part\r\n\r\nof  the reason why the economy has turned sour.  Did we not  try\r\n\r\nto  get  more gains out of the stock market or property  market?\r\n\r\nDid we not try to get more pay to buy a second home or have more\r\n\r\noverseas  holidays, without regard whether we  are  adding  more\r\n\r\nvalue  to our jobs?  Collectively, yes.  Greed in people  drives\r\n\r\nthe market economy.  But that very market economy is sustainable\r\n\r\nonly  if  the  collective decisions or the expectations  of  the\r\n\r\nplayers  are  rational.  When the decisions  become  irrational,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  when the speculative effect overwhelms the investment\r\n\r\neffect or the cost overwhelms\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproductivity,  the market has to correct itself  to  a  truthful\r\n\r\nequilibrium position.  We should not cry now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, as a nation, as a people, we should take stock.\r\n\r\nWe  should  honestly  and  boldly be self-critical.   We  should\r\n\r\nexamine  our  systems for possible weaknesses,  reflect  on  our\r\n\r\nmistakes and then tap on the internal and external resources  to\r\n\r\nformulate  new  strategies to move on.   With  $100  billion  in\r\n\r\nreserves,  our  economic situation is not in a state  of  panic.\r\n\r\nBut  we should not be complacent either.  Rather, we should  see\r\n\r\nwhat  our  huge reserves and our people, that is the only  other\r\n\r\nreserve we have, can serve to procure us a better future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to draw an analogy to a situation faced\r\n\r\nby  a  large and cash-rich corporation like IBM a few years ago,\r\n\r\neven  Microsoft,  two or three years ago,  when  they  faced  an\r\n\r\nattack  on  the  Internet issue, and how  these  companies  with\r\n\r\nbloating cost, with possibly unwise investment or wrong  product\r\n\r\nlines,   had   eroded  their  competitiveness  in   the   global\r\n\r\nmarketplace.   So what would the CEO do?  The immediate task  of\r\n\r\nthe turnaround CEO would be to troubleshoot quickly by examining\r\n\r\ntheir   strengths  and  weaknesses  internally  and  externally,\r\n\r\nbenchmark  its  own company against the best in the  world,  and\r\n\r\nformulate  a  clear  strategy to rally its  employees  from  the\r\n\r\nbottom to the top to work towards a new corporate goal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly believe that, for a nation like Singapore, we\r\n\r\nshould  do  exactly  the same but on an even  larger  and  wider\r\n\r\nscale,  covering  not only the economic issues  but  social  and\r\n\r\npolitical  as well.  Before we can rally the people  round,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should face the economic crisis and take advantage of\r\n\r\nit for future opportunities.  We should carry out a diagnosis to\r\n\r\nfind  out the symptoms and put forward a very clear plan stating\r\n\r\nthe  directions,  the  resources  required,  the  timeframe  and\r\n\r\npossible belt-tightening measures that our people and businesses\r\n\r\nhave  to bear to cope with the economic slowdown and be prepared\r\n\r\nfor a brighter future.  Without the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplan, I do not think people can see the light at the end of  the\r\n\r\ntunnel.  That is what they are feeling now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent economic forecast conducted by various agencies\r\n\r\nshows  that  most  likely Singapore is going  to  have  negative\r\n\r\ngrowth  for  the  third  and  fourth  quarters.   Barring   some\r\n\r\nexceptional  turnaround,  we  are  definitely  heading   for   a\r\n\r\nrecession.   Hence, I think the Government should  not  hesitate\r\n\r\nnow  to  assert its leadership by declaring a very comprehensive\r\n\r\nnational  action plan that will help to mobilise and  unite  the\r\n\r\npeople as a cohesive force to resolve the economic problems.\r\n\r\nThe  citizens  of  Singapore  can lend  better  support  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  if  they  are convinced.  The efforts  are  genuine,\r\n\r\nworkable,  comprehensive,  not  just  piecemeal,  haphazard   or\r\n\r\nsectoral.   When  a person is feeling down, he needs  comforting\r\n\r\nwords.  In this trying moment, it is particularly necessary  for\r\n\r\nthe Government to be more sensitive to the nagging complaints of\r\n\r\nits people.  To cite just a few examples, the typical complaints\r\n\r\nare, as Mr Inderjit Singh has pointed out many times before, the\r\n\r\nencroachment  into private business domain by the GLCs  and  the\r\n\r\nresistance  to changes by Government departments.  For  example,\r\n\r\nMr  Lim Swee Say mentioned about the concept of price-minus  and\r\n\r\ncost-plus, and also the lack of sensitivity or understanding  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  administrators about the  problems  in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.  Another example would be  - of course, everybody  knows\r\n\r\nabout this - the ever rising business costs and, last,  the boom\r\n\r\nand  bust  of  the  property  sector  and  its  related  banking\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first few problems have been very well covered by all\r\n\r\nthe  Members  here earlier and I am not going to  elaborate  any\r\n\r\nfurther.  The last one has been touched on by Mr Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nand Mr Rai, but I think I want to elaborate more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, I think the property sector makes up too big a\r\n\r\nchunk  in our whole economy.  Based on the Straits Times  report\r\n\r\nlast  week,  correct  me  if  I am wrong,  the  people  and  the\r\n\r\ninstitutions in Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommitted  $140 billion to the property sector.  Last  Saturday,\r\n\r\nin  a  Chinese  paper,  there was a report  on  the  Accountant-General's  Report on the Government's net worth.  It  shows  net\r\n\r\nassets  of  $251 billion.  Hence, even a primary school  student\r\n\r\ncan find out that the total commitment to property is equivalent\r\n\r\nto 60% of the total assets of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, concerning the same matter, I understand that the\r\n\r\nvaluation  of  land  by the Government is based  on  the  moving\r\n\r\naverage  of recent land tenders.  Now I am going to give Members\r\n\r\nsome  examples.   Supposing the price of the  last  $10  billion\r\n\r\nworth  of land is bidded up by 10%, that means somebody pays  $1\r\n\r\nbillion  extra  for  the $10 billion.  Then the  remaining  $130\r\n\r\nbillion would correspondingly rise by 10% too.  That is the  way\r\n\r\nwe value our land, and that is a $13 billion increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, all the property owners are euphoric over this and the\r\n\r\nbanks,  of  course, feel very secure and they probably encourage\r\n\r\nmore  borrowing.  With more loans available, what happens?   The\r\n\r\nborrowers  would buy more properties and so they chase  property\r\n\r\nprices up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our financial institutions, whose traditional preferred\r\n\r\nlending  policy  is  to  have property as  collateral,  actually\r\n\r\nencourage the property sector to grow in this unhealthy  manner.\r\n\r\nYou  can imagine if you are an owner of a firm, you invest money\r\n\r\ninto  training your workers.  Would the bank lend you the money?\r\n\r\nBut  I  am  sure  if you use the money to pay  for  a  piece  of\r\n\r\nproperty  and  mortgage it to the bank, the bank  will  be  very\r\n\r\nhappy.   So where is the line drawn?  Are we encouraging  people\r\n\r\nto  buy property or are we encouraging people to put more  money\r\n\r\ninto  something less tangible?  Because of this practice,  as  a\r\n\r\nvery  prominent  foreign  banker  pointed  out,  the  banks   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  probably  have not perfected their  skill  in  making\r\n\r\nloans  in  any  other way but getting a piece of property  as  a\r\n\r\ncollateral.   So  in boom years, because of this lending  policy\r\n\r\nand  because  the way land is being valued, the property  sector\r\n\r\ngrew disproportionately\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto the whole economy.  The banks' performance also exceeded that\r\n\r\nof the GDP, year after year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the economic crisis prevailing in the region,\r\n\r\nthis issue is here to haunt us.  It is beginning to appear, from\r\n\r\nwhat I read in the papers, that the country seems to be held  to\r\n\r\nransom  by  the  property  developers  and  the  banks,  because\r\n\r\neverybody  worries that the bankruptcy of these companies  would\r\n\r\nhave  far-reaching repercussions.  So we have  to  address  this\r\n\r\nissue.   The importance of addressing this issue cannot be  over\r\n\r\nemphasised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an individual, the problem closest to my chest is the\r\n\r\nfear  of not being able to maintain payments of a mortgage  loan\r\n\r\nat   a   time  of  unemployment.   As  a  nation,  our  economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness is also dragged down by the over  investment  in\r\n\r\nlow value added properties.  So I beg to urge the Government  to\r\n\r\nconfront this issue head on and do some clear thinking about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not here to speak against the developers and bankers.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  here to beg the Government to subsidise the property\r\n\r\nsector.  But I think the more sensible way to solve this problem\r\n\r\nnow  is  to  moderate the decline in property prices in  a  very\r\n\r\ngradual way so that there will be a soft landing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should the Government do now? I think the Government\r\n\r\nshould  immediately accelerate the creation  of  new  wealth  in\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy,  as  Mr  Singh  has  pointed  out,  by\r\n\r\ndiverting  more  of our resources to human capital  and  to  the\r\n\r\npromotion of new industries.  In the long run, we should  reduce\r\n\r\nour  overall  exposure  to  properties  and  increase  high-tech\r\n\r\nservices  or,  as  Mr Lim described, the capability  competitive\r\n\r\nsector, significantly.  And in the short term, to alleviate  the\r\n\r\nunemployment problem, the Government should come out and  stress\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  workers to work harder and  smarter,  so  as  to\r\n\r\nincrease  productivity which is in a way translated into  better\r\n\r\nchance  of keeping jobs.  The employers, of course, should  also\r\n\r\nadopt a more positive attitude rather than the kind of pessimism\r\n\r\nthey seem to convey in the press.  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  improve themselves by emphasising on more skill training\r\n\r\nfor  their  workers and also get involved in  more  value  added\r\n\r\nactivities.   And,  of  course, the  Government  can  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to show their concern, to establish rapport with the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  by  helping them to search for new  strategies,  new\r\n\r\ndirections or new markets beyond the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, Sir, I support the motion by sharing Mr Lim's\r\n\r\ncall  on the Government to blur the invisible line drawn between\r\n\r\nme,  Government, and you, the private sector, and work  together\r\n\r\nas a united force to brave the storms ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, we have come to almost the end of\r\n\r\nthe  debate  and  I do not think it would be useful  for  me  to\r\n\r\nsuggest any solutions to our economic problems, because I  think\r\n\r\nmost or nearly all the solutions have already been given in this\r\n\r\nHouse today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like my colleague, Mr Low Thia Khiang, the other Opposition\r\n\r\nMember  in this House, I think we are particularly concerned  in\r\n\r\nthis  issue of social cohesion.  I support what Mr Low has said,\r\n\r\nie,  the Government should be fair to all citizens whether  they\r\n\r\nare  in  the  Opposition  or whether  they  are  supporting  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   In good times, when the economy was  booming,  our\r\n\r\nbanks  were flushed with money, the Government spoke a different\r\n\r\nlanguage.   At the last election, the Government said,  \"If  you\r\n\r\nsupport the opposition, you will be last in the queue.  Probably\r\n\r\nyou  will  never  even see upgrading.\"  That kind  of  a  policy\r\n\r\nalienates one section of the population from the other.  And we,\r\n\r\nin  the  Opposition, have felt the alienation  policies  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   We  have  heard  threats  being  uttered  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  \"that if you vote the Opposition  and  if  you  get\r\n\r\nstuck in the lift, you should be rescued last.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Even now,  presently,\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition is being unfairly treated.  A simple application\r\n\r\nfor  the  use of land to fly kites or to hold a lantern festival\r\n\r\nand  we  would  not get an early reply.  How  are  we  going  to\r\n\r\nprepare  for  the event?  How are we going to send out  notices?\r\n\r\nAnd  every time we ring up and ask about a simple answer to  the\r\n\r\napplication, they say, \"We can't give you an answer now  because\r\n\r\nthe  answer from the top has not come down yet.\"  Sir,  the  way\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition is treated is really shameful.  So I  hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  if it wants a true cohesive society,  I  think\r\n\r\nthey   should  treat  the  Opposition  fairly  like  any   other\r\n\r\nSingaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has spoken about the CIPC funds. Millions of\r\n\r\ndollars  have  been  distributed  to  the  PAP  wards,  but  the\r\n\r\nOpposition wards are not enjoying any of those funds.  Then when\r\n\r\nwe  talk of applications we wish to make, we always seem to  get\r\n\r\nit  rather  slowly, whether it is for a licence to  speak  at  a\r\n\r\npublic dinner or whatever simple applications like that.   Then,\r\n\r\nevery  week,  we  have  to meet in the  void  deck  to  see  our\r\n\r\nresidents and other people from other parts of Singapore in  the\r\n\r\nmeet-the-people  sessions.  We do not have  a  proper  place  to\r\n\r\nmeet,  whereas the PAP MPs have got nice air-conditioned  rooms,\r\n\r\ncomputer sets, everything.  But we, as I have said, are like the\r\n\r\nChinese  medicine sellers with one table and one  chair  at  the\r\n\r\nvoid deck.  So I hope all these can change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, do the Opposition support the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in times of difficulty?  Of course, we do.   We  are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  We want to see Singapore do well.  We want to see\r\n\r\nthat  the economic downturn can go away very quickly.  Dr  Vasoo\r\n\r\nhas  spoken of the fact that we are all in the same boat. I know\r\n\r\nwe  are  all in the same boat, but we are not even in the  third\r\n\r\nclass.   Probably  we are in the bottom or in the  hull  of  the\r\n\r\nship.   Whereas the PAP and others who support them are  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst class.  Nevertheless, if we sink, we all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsink together.  It is true that we are all in the same boat  but\r\n\r\nI hope that there can only be one class and not several classes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards this problem of the economic downturn, how do we\r\n\r\nturn  around?  As the Deputy Prime Minister has said in  public,\r\n\r\nthe problem is external.  This is like a person getting flu.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  go through the full cycle and then we get cured.   But\r\n\r\nmeanwhile, I think what we can do is to try to give a remedy  to\r\n\r\nthe symptoms to lighten the sickness.  I think Mr Tay Beng Chuan\r\n\r\nhas  already said and I think the Government should look at  the\r\n\r\nproblems   and   the  plight  of  the  small   business   people\r\n\r\nsympathetically and if it can, I think it should lower  some  of\r\n\r\nits  levies, its charges and lower the costs of all these  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think in the long term, the important thing is\r\n\r\nproductivity.  Even foreign organisations have pointed out  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  workers  have  got  a  bad  attitude  and  have   low\r\n\r\nproductivity.   I  have seen it with my own eyes.   We  were  in\r\n\r\nCopenhagen once on some kind of a conference and we  were  in  a\r\n\r\nlounge  of  a hotel.  I noticed that only one lady was  managing\r\n\r\neverything,  collecting money, taking orders, being a  waitress,\r\n\r\nserving, taking back all the used plates and crockery. Sometimes\r\n\r\nshe  was  assisted by a man who came out once  or  twice.   But,\r\n\r\nbasically,  it was one lady doing the work.  I have  never  seen\r\n\r\nthat  kind  of productivity in Singapore.  I hope we can  really\r\n\r\nimprove our productivity.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing wrong with our Singapore workers.   They  are\r\n\r\nvery  skilful.   I  think they can work if  they  want  to,  the\r\n\r\nproblem is attitude.  Singaporean workers have got something  in\r\n\r\nthem which is hard to describe.  They seem to be reluctant to be\r\n\r\nas  productive as what they should be.  I think the  genesis  of\r\n\r\nthis attitude problem is our education system.  I think there is\r\n\r\na flaw in our education system.  All this streaming and dividing\r\n\r\nthe  sheep from the goat is bad for the child.  Right  from  the\r\n\r\nearly  age, the motivation of the child has already been killed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is negative motivation on the child.  As the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchild  grows up, he just refuses to be cooperative.  He  refuses\r\n\r\nto  contribute and be socially useful.  So there is  a  negative\r\n\r\nattitude  about this type of children who have been  branded  in\r\n\r\nthe  early days as a failure, as a no-good, as a drop  out.   So\r\n\r\nwhat  do you expect him to be?  If you tell me that I am a drop-out, I am no good, what do you expect me to be?  I think for the\r\n\r\nlong-term of Singapore, not just for quick turn around  in  this\r\n\r\neconomic downturn, the education system of our country has to be\r\n\r\nlooked at hard.  I have spoken against streaming at an early age\r\n\r\nsince 1984 and the problem is always there.  I was in Parliament\r\n\r\nin  1984  and  they  were saying that half  of  our  600,000-odd\r\n\r\nworkers  did  not even have an education.  They were illiterate.\r\n\r\nThey  did not know how to read.  They did not know how to write.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot  recognise  numbers.  How  are  they  going  to  be\r\n\r\nproductive? Today, we still hear the same thing.  700,000 of our\r\n\r\nworkers have got no secondary education.  As for retraining,  it\r\n\r\nis  only  5,000 of them.  That is not good enough.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nrevamp  the education system across the board and only if  their\r\n\r\nproductivity is high, then their wages are justified.   This  is\r\n\r\nthe message that I want to tell the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is attitude. We should give the dignity to\r\n\r\nour  labourers.   There  is dignity in  labour.   That  must  be\r\n\r\nrecognised.  If a person has to work with his hand,  so  be  it.\r\n\r\nBut  he can be proud of it and be good at it.  Whether he  is  a\r\n\r\ncook  or  a  carpenter, if he is good at it, then  society  must\r\n\r\nrespect  him  for  what he can do, and not stress  too  much  on\r\n\r\nacademism, brain work and degrees.  In fact, a former Member  of\r\n\r\nthis  House  has already pointed out that there is too  great  a\r\n\r\ndisparity   of  wages  between  manual  workers  and  university\r\n\r\ngraduates.   If  you  go  to  a western  country,  you  will  be\r\n\r\nsurprised  to note that a carpenter can earn just as much  as  a\r\n\r\nuniversity graduate.  But I am just trying to say that his skill\r\n\r\nis recognised by society and he is paid for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans can be educated to get rid of their negative\r\n\r\nmotivation  and be taught initiative, leadership,  and  work  on\r\n\r\ntheir own instead of always being supervised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  think  one  of the problems of foreign workers -   they  have\r\n\r\nalmost  nil productivity - is because they have to be supervised\r\n\r\nall the time.  I have seen that in the Town Council.  As soon as\r\n\r\nyou leave the foreign workers alone, off they go somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThey  would  not  be  working  anymore.   So  they  have  to  be\r\n\r\nsupervised every minute of the day.  That is the problem.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  we want our workers to be like that.   We  want  our\r\n\r\nworkers to be responsible and to show initiative.  If you  leave\r\n\r\nthem on their own, you pay them a day's wage, they will give you\r\n\r\na day's work.\r\n\r\n<br>5.33 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Second Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, I support the motion standing in the names of Mr\r\n\r\nLim Swee  Say and Mr Seng Han Thong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In discussing the problems of employment and employability,\r\n\r\nit is important to understand the nature of this crisis, because\r\n\r\nwhat  we  do must be in accord with the dynamics of this crisis.\r\n\r\nThis  is the biggest event sweeping Asia since the Second  World\r\n\r\nWar.   It is a big thing.  Already it has brought down a  number\r\n\r\nof   national  leaders,  like  General  Chaovalit  in  Thailand,\r\n\r\nPresident  Suharto  in  Indonesia, Prime Minister  Hashimoto  in\r\n\r\nJapan.  It contributed to the election of Kim Dae Jung in  South\r\n\r\nKorea and President Estrada in the Philippines.  It is not  over\r\n\r\nyet. We know it is not over yet because the fundamental problems\r\n\r\nhave not yet been resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is, of course, the Japanese economy, which is two-thirds of the Asian economy. The old political consensus in\r\n\r\nJapan  has broken down.  Today, it does not matter how brilliant\r\n\r\nyou are as a Minister or as a civil servant.  Within that sticky\r\n\r\nrice  culture,  it is very difficult to effect  change.   Within\r\n\r\nJapan  itself,  there is no great sense of  a  crisis.   Because\r\n\r\nJapan is unable to re-stimulate her economy, the effects of  the\r\n\r\nAsian  crisis  have  not  only  not  been  contained,  they  are\r\n\r\nincreasingly being felt in North America and in Europe.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would have read in yesterday's newspapers President\r\n\r\nClinton using the argument to Congress to persuade them to cough\r\n\r\nup  more  money for the IMF, that if they do not, and the  Asian\r\n\r\ncrisis  is not stabilised, it will in the end drag down  the  US\r\n\r\neconomy.  These are large forces not within our control. We have\r\n\r\nto  observe  them closely and carefully, the way a farmer  would\r\n\r\ntry to estimate the effects of an El Nino.  There is nothing you\r\n\r\ncan  do about an El Nino.   But you can dig reservoirs, you  can\r\n\r\nprotect yourself, and this is the approach that we should  take.\r\n\r\nThis   is  completely  different  from  the  1985/86  recession.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we should not be too quick to apply the  lessons  of\r\n\r\n1985/86  recession  to this current economic downturn,  just  as\r\n\r\ngenerals  have always been advised, never, never  to  fight  the\r\n\r\nlast war.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take, for instance, a big change in the larger situation,\r\n\r\nthe  dollar-yen relationship.  In 1985, the Japanese yen was 250\r\n\r\nyen  to US$1.  The Americans complained that it was too low, and\r\n\r\nthey had this current account deficit.  During the Plaza Accord,\r\n\r\nthey  forced  Japan to revalue the yen, and within three  years,\r\n\r\nfrom the Plaza Accord in 1985 to 1988, the yen rose from 250 yen\r\n\r\nto  US$1, to 130 yen to US$1.  If you look at the graph, that is\r\n\r\njust  one  movement.  But it created a sea change  in  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia,  because  an expensive yen led to an outflow  of  Japanese\r\n\r\ncapital  out  of  Japan  and a lot of  it  found  its  way  into\r\n\r\nSoutheast    Asia.     Malaysia   had    good    infrastructure,\r\n\r\nadministrative  and  physical  infrastructure,   they   were   a\r\n\r\nbeneficiary.   So was Thailand.  The Plaza Accord was  in  1985,\r\n\r\nand by the end of 1986/87, Malaysia and Thailand were on a boom.\r\n\r\nWe  were  coming out of the recession and we were  swept  along.\r\n\r\nIndonesia  had a boom later in 1988/89.  China after  Tiananmen,\r\n\r\nJune 4th 1989, by 1990/91, ethnic Chinese capital from Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia, Taiwan, Hong Kong went in, and that in turn sparked off  a\r\n\r\nChinese boom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese economy is huge. It dominates most of Asia.\r\n\r\nSo  that 50% change in the value of the yen led to an in-rushing\r\n\r\ntide which brought prosperity to all of Southeast Asia.  It  was\r\n\r\nsupplemented by a revaluation of Korean Won and the Taiwan\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNT.   So  in addition to the capital flow from Japan, there  was\r\n\r\nalso  the  capital flow from the NIEs.  Let us now look  at  the\r\n\r\nevents of the last few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of 1995, it was 80 yen to a dollar. Today,\r\n\r\n1998,  it  is about 143, 144, 145 yen to a dollar.   Within  the\r\n\r\nsame  period  of three years, the yen has moved the  other  way,\r\n\r\nabout  50%.   Because  of it, it has an enormous  contractionary\r\n\r\neffect  on  the  economies of all of Southeast Asia.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, what we are talking about are huge tidal flows over which\r\n\r\nwe  have no control because the yen-dollar relationship  is  not\r\n\r\ndependent  upon what happens in Southeast Asia.  It is dependent\r\n\r\nupon  the  complex interaction between the US  economy  and  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  economy.  The key contradiction now is that Japan  has\r\n\r\nno  capacity  to  lead internationally, even though  it  is  the\r\n\r\nworld's  greatest creditor country.  America is the only leading\r\n\r\nsuperpower left in the world but it is also the world's greatest\r\n\r\ndebtor  country.   It  is a complex relationship  suffused  with\r\n\r\npolicy and other implications.  But that relationship plays dice\r\n\r\nwith  our  lives.   The  question now is,  this  tide  which  is\r\n\r\nreceding,  how  long will it recede?  The last tide  brought  10\r\n\r\nyears  of  prosperity to Southeast Asia. This tide, we  hope  it\r\n\r\nwill  turn  around quickly, but I do not see it  turning  around\r\n\r\nyet, and we have to wait, and have to wait anxiously, and in the\r\n\r\nmeantime  take all necessary precautions.  We hope for the  best\r\n\r\nbut prepare for the worst.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of boom in Southeast Asia led to a period of\r\n\r\nexcess.   Suddenly money was easy.  Borrow American  dollars  on\r\n\r\nthe short term.  Institutions were weak and capital markets were\r\n\r\nopened freely before the regulatory structures were in place. So\r\n\r\nthey  became very vulnerable to short term capital flows.   This\r\n\r\nhappened in particular in Thailand and Indonesia.  Worse,  there\r\n\r\ngrew  in Southeast Asia, political structures which were  fueled\r\n\r\nby  easy money.  Politically connected vested interest got rich,\r\n\r\nbecause they were near centres of power.  All that was fine  and\r\n\r\na  wonderful game to play when the tide was coming in.  Now when\r\n\r\nthe tide is receding, all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose  poorly  built structures have either  collapsed  or  have\r\n\r\nbecome very shaky.  During high tide, the water looks very  calm\r\n\r\nand beautiful.  During low tide, all the sins and wreckage show.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we are completely affected. Because we are,\r\n\r\nas  it  were, in the middle of that tidal cross flow.  We cannot\r\n\r\nfight the tide.   If we fight the tide, we are sure to lose.  We\r\n\r\nmust float with the tide.  We are feeling it.  There is a lot of\r\n\r\npessimism  in Singapore, not all of it justified.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nrevise  our growth projections downwards every few months.   And\r\n\r\nas  Mr  Lim  Swee  Say  and  many MPs  have  spoken  about  this\r\n\r\nafternoon, unemployment is growing and will continue to grow for\r\n\r\na  while  yet.  But unlike many of the countries around us,  our\r\n\r\nfundamentals  are  strong.  This is where I profoundly  disagree\r\n\r\nwith Mr Low Thia Khiang who said that when we were successful we\r\n\r\nblew our trumpet.  Now when the tide is down, we should take the\r\n\r\nblame.  We never took liberties with ourselves.  Even when times\r\n\r\nwere  good, we were frugal.  In fact, the PAP Government  had  a\r\n\r\ncertain  reputation  for  being very  careful  with  money,  and\r\n\r\nwatching  the  cents.  We were like Joseph in Egypt.   Years  of\r\n\r\nplenty,  rather  than squandering the money, we carefully  built\r\n\r\nwarehouses, stashed away whatever we could, whatever we did  not\r\n\r\nconsume,   wasting  not  a  grain,  because  we  were  preparing\r\n\r\nourselves  mentally for difficult times.  I hope  the  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes  will not be as long as in the Bible, but still we  cannot\r\n\r\nbe sure.  We should not take liberties with ourselves, as we did\r\n\r\nnot when times were good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, of course, as a number of speakers have pointed out\r\n\r\nthis  afternoon,  there have been a few excesses  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the property market.  Young people  became  very\r\n\r\nambitious, leverage themselves to the eye balls, and are now  in\r\n\r\ntrouble.  It is sad that every generation must learn its lessons\r\n\r\nfor  itself, that whatever their parents may have to tell  them,\r\n\r\nthey must make their own mistakes before an internal balance  is\r\n\r\nfound.   But because our infrastructure is basically strong  and\r\n\r\nour  system  is  basically  sound, I  think  that  lesson  comes\r\n\r\nrelatively cheap.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crucial, as Mr Lim Swee Say and many MPs have\r\n\r\nsaid, that whatever the situation, whether the tide is coming in\r\n\r\nor   going  out,  that  we  maintain  our  relative  competitive\r\n\r\nposition.  Take no chances.  Always assume that things will  get\r\n\r\na  bit worse.  It is like running with lead weights.  If you  do\r\n\r\nnot  have to wear those weights, you fly.  Here, we have got  to\r\n\r\nworry  about not just short term investment conditions  but  the\r\n\r\nlong term, as Mr Inderjit Singh has said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is to convince domestic and international investors\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore runs a tight ship, that our core  philosophy  is\r\n\r\nthat  there is no free lunch in the world.  That if  we  make  a\r\n\r\ngood  living it is because we are of service to others.  No  one\r\n\r\nowes  us a living.  If we have something in the kitchen, we have\r\n\r\nsomething in the living room, it is because we work hard for it.\r\n\r\nWe  must  continue to project this philosophy to  all  potential\r\n\r\ninvestors, foreigners and Singaporeans, that whatever we need to\r\n\r\ndo,  we  will  do.    There are no sacred cows.   There  are  no\r\n\r\nmindsets.  If we have to adjust, we will adjust.  That  is  all.\r\n\r\nBecause  if we do not adjust, if we become paralysed or ossified\r\n\r\nin  our present position, then we will be swept aside.  That  is\r\n\r\nall.   I  think most Singaporeans understand this.   And  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  they understand this that we continue to do  well.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  when  I  listened to the many Members of  Parliament  who\r\n\r\nspoke  today, except for the two Opposition MPs who have to  say\r\n\r\nsomething,  on  the whole, there were really no  sides  to  this\r\n\r\ndebate.   On the fundamentals of competitiveness and  having  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  living  in the world, on education, on  discipline,  on\r\n\r\ncollective  effort, there is no disagreement.  And this  is  the\r\n\r\ngreat strength of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries in Asia today, because of economic\r\n\r\nastringency,  very  quickly  the  economic  problem  becomes   a\r\n\r\npolitical problem, and the fracture quickly finds its way to the\r\n\r\ncore, because powerful vested interests are involved.  I support\r\n\r\nA,  he  wins,  I am millions of dollars richer; he loses,  I  am\r\n\r\nfinished.   If B wins, he wins, and so on.  But in  our  system,\r\n\r\ncomplete   rationality,  complete  objectivity.   If   this   is\r\n\r\nsomething that must\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe done, let us do it.  We can disagree honestly, but not on the\r\n\r\nbasis of your vested interest versus his vested interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You remember last year before the crisis, we established\r\n\r\nthe  CSC,  the Committee to look at Singapore's competitiveness,\r\n\r\nchaired  by  Minister Mr Lee Yock Suan.  And no sooner  had  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  sat for two or three sessions, we were straight  into\r\n\r\nthe  downturn.   At  each  meeting it was  a  different  set  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances than the previous one.  So we have had  to  adjust\r\n\r\nour position.  When we started, a top item on the agenda was job-hopping,  and many papers were written on how to stop  the  job-hopping problem - very creative policy adjustments to stop  that\r\n\r\nproblem.  Today, that problem has completely evaporated.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot   even  talk  about  it.   The  problems  are  unemployment,\r\n\r\nrestructuring, competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has been meeting, its sub-Committees have\r\n\r\nbeen working very hard.  The report will come out at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  year.  And many of the ideas have already been incorporated\r\n\r\nin  the  meantime.  It is economic competitiveness  in  the  end\r\n\r\nwhich will solve the problem of employment and employability  in\r\n\r\nSingapore;   nothing  else.   And  to  maintain   our   economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, there are two things that you have to watch out\r\n\r\nfor, and they never change.  One is our cost structure.  It does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  that we cheapen ourselves.  Cost structure  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that we must be the cheapest in town.  We offer value  for\r\n\r\nmoney, but we must watch the cost structure to make sure that we\r\n\r\nare not out of whack.  Secondly, and this is an endless task, we\r\n\r\nmust continually increase productivity and efficiency.  This  is\r\n\r\nan endless game.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost structure. Lowering business cost was, of course, the\r\n\r\nfocus  of Dr Richard Hu's off-Budget measures which came  to  $2\r\n\r\nbillion.  If you look at the exchange rates, we can be in danger\r\n\r\nof  being  uncompetitive.   Around  us,  Malaysia,  Philippines,\r\n\r\nThailand,  they  have  gone down close to 40%,  Indonesia,  much\r\n\r\nmore.  We have only gone down 15% to 20%.  Of course, Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nhas maintained the peg.  So they are above us.  But\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  any  of us who has travelled in the region will know, things\r\n\r\nlook  incredibly cheap in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines.  So if we are not careful, very quickly investments\r\n\r\ncan  flow out of Singapore into the region around us.   We  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  watch  the  cost  structure, and  make  sure  that  all\r\n\r\ncomponents of costs are kept as low as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want to fiddle with the exchange rate, because\r\n\r\nthe  reason  why the Singapore dollar is viewed with  such  high\r\n\r\nregard  in  the  region  and  why so many  ten  thousand  dollar\r\n\r\nSingapore  notes  are in circulation in the  region  is  because\r\n\r\nthere  is  a deep trust in its value.  And I would say  that  it\r\n\r\nlies  at the core of our financial system.  The easy way a  weak\r\n\r\ngovernment would take is to lower the Singapore dollar,  devalue\r\n\r\nit.   And  then you get a flush, things may appear  better,  but\r\n\r\nlong-term problems are not solved.  And I do not think we should\r\n\r\nuse the Singapore dollar to solve this problem.  Instead, let us\r\n\r\nbe   trim  and  flexible.   If  we  have  to  make  adjustments,\r\n\r\nGovernment, workers, unions, everybody together, we  make  those\r\n\r\nadjustments,  take the decisions, and not toy  around  with  the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land cost, rental cost, because of the boom years, they\r\n\r\nhave  gone out of line.  So they are coming down.  I think  they\r\n\r\nwill have to ease to a lower level.  We want a soft landing.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  a major destabilisation of our financial  system.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  think the market will gradually correct itself,  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  be in a more competitive situation in the coming  years.\r\n\r\nOf  course, when the tide comes in again, then we will float  up\r\n\r\nagain.  But in the meantime, do not take it for granted.  Let us\r\n\r\nease ourselves into the lower position so that rentals are lower\r\n\r\nand business costs are lower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Tay Beng Chuan and other MPs have said, we must also\r\n\r\nwatch Government levies, Government fees and taxes, and whatever\r\n\r\ncauses  problems, and where we can make adjustments, we  should.\r\n\r\nBut  this  is really for the Finance Minister to decide  and  we\r\n\r\nhave to wait till\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnext  March for new measures to be announced, if and when  those\r\n\r\nmeasures are deemed to be necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major component is, of course, wage level,\r\n\r\nespecially  in the service industry where it can  be  more  than\r\n\r\nhalf of total cost.  In many manufacturing sectors, it could  be\r\n\r\nup  to 40%.  We have got to allow wages to adjust.  Mr Lim  Swee\r\n\r\nSay  said  that to be pro-employment is to be pro-business.   In\r\n\r\nthe  old  days,  that would have been considered  a  reactionary\r\n\r\nremark.   Today, that is a very progressive remark.  To be  pro-employment is to be pro-business.  Because if the businesses  do\r\n\r\nnot  survive, where is the employment?  So we have got to  watch\r\n\r\nour  wage  levels,  accept  that  it  varies  from  industry  to\r\n\r\nindustry,  from  company  to  company  but,  at  the  least,  we\r\n\r\nrestrain;  at  the  most, we prepare for adjustments.   We  have\r\n\r\nbuilt up over the years now a variable component of up to 20% in\r\n\r\nthe  public  sector  and maybe 16% in the  private  sector.   We\r\n\r\nshould  be  prepared to go into those before talking  about  the\r\n\r\nCPF.  But even if it means talking about the CPF, so be it.   No\r\n\r\nsacred  cows.  Whatever we need to stay competitive.   And  that\r\n\r\nmust  be  the impression we give to foreign and local investors.\r\n\r\nThis   Government,  this  society,  these  people   called   the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  they  will do everything  necessary  to  stay  in\r\n\r\nbusiness, and we intend to stay in business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should, of course, minimise unemployment. But\r\n\r\nminimising  unemployment  must not mean  stopping  unemployment.\r\n\r\nThat  will be very dangerous.  The Ministry of Manpower has  set\r\n\r\nup  a tripartite retrenchment panel so that companies which have\r\n\r\nto  retrench  would give early warning, and try to  prepare  the\r\n\r\nworkers  for  it.  We have the SRP.  We have various  funds  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes to help retrain them and to get them new jobs so that\r\n\r\nthe  pain  is minimised.  But if that company, if the  industry,\r\n\r\ncannot  sustain that level of employment, their unemployment  is\r\n\r\ninevitable, we should not stop it.  It is part of the process of\r\n\r\nadjusting.   We have got to float with the tide.  If  we  anchor\r\n\r\nourselves when the tide is shifting, we will be in trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan spoke at length about the plight of the\r\n\r\nSMEs  and  how many of them are in pain.  There is  a  liquidity\r\n\r\ncrunch and the LEFS programme which is introduced can only  help\r\n\r\nsome of them.  I think we should do all that we can to make life\r\n\r\neasier  for  them  but we must accept that whatever  we  do,  we\r\n\r\ncannot save everybody.  If we try to save everybody, we will  be\r\n\r\nin  deep  trouble.  But those whom we can save, we should  save.\r\n\r\nThe  LEFS  is being extended in order to allow more to be  taken\r\n\r\nin.   But  at  the  end  of  the day,  the  banks  must  decide.\r\n\r\nGovernment is only co-financing.  The banks must decide who will\r\n\r\nsurvive and who will not.  Yes, if we can raise the level of the\r\n\r\nwater  by  one  inch more, more will be saved;  but  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to freeze things in position.   That will be the  wrong\r\n\r\nstrategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is on the cost side. Then on the productivity and\r\n\r\nefficiency side, there are many things that we have to do.   The\r\n\r\nkey  in  the  end  is  the individual.  We  can  have  the  best\r\n\r\ninfrastructure. We can have all the programmes,  all  the  bells\r\n\r\nand whistles, but if the individual does not make the effort and\r\n\r\ndoes  not try harder, nothing can be done.  And all our  efforts\r\n\r\nare to enable the individual to help himself.  Unless he is sick\r\n\r\nor  an invalid, there should be a way out for him through one of\r\n\r\nour programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SRP was initiated by the NTUC, together with the SNEF\r\n\r\nand  the  Government.   SDF put in $50 million.  The  Government\r\n\r\nthrew in another $50 million.  And recently the Government added\r\n\r\nanother $20 million.  So they set up a skills development centre\r\n\r\nand  introduce a whole range of courses.  In other  words,  when\r\n\r\nthe  economic agencies sense there are areas of potential growth\r\n\r\nwhich   can  take  additional  employment,  we  put  out   these\r\n\r\nindicators, encourage those who might be unemployed  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves and try.  But, of course, as many MPs have  said,  it\r\n\r\nmay  mean  that they have to travel further.  It may  mean  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  to work shifts.  It may mean that they have  got  to\r\n\r\nconvert from white collar to blue collar.  But so what?   I  was\r\n\r\nin  Thailand  two  or  three weeks ago.   There  was  this  Thai\r\n\r\nbusinessman whose company had gone bust, and he now sells\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsandwiches.  The newspapers have been reporting on him.   He  is\r\n\r\nbubbly  and very cheerful about it, and in a very wonderful  way\r\n\r\nhe has given heart to a lot of Thai people.  And if Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmake   that  effort,  I  do  not  think  that  the  problem   of\r\n\r\nunemployment  will get out of hand.  To begin  with,  there  are\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  thousands of work permit holders in Singapore  and\r\n\r\nmany of their jobs can in fact be taken over by Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must educate every individual to the fullest possible.\r\n\r\nMdm  Claire  Chiang has talked about social infrastructure.   We\r\n\r\nare  spending  a  lot  of money on building up  our  educational\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.   Not  just a formal school  system  of  primary\r\n\r\nschools, secondary schools, ITEs, polytechnics and universities,\r\n\r\nbut  also life-long education, so that all of us are used to the\r\n\r\nidea of going back to school to update ourselves, whether it  is\r\n\r\non  Windows,  whether it is on computer-aided manufacturing,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever.   Eventually, what we hope is for all our institutions\r\n\r\nto  become \"one institute, two systems\"  - one system for  those\r\n\r\nwho  come  out from school; the other for those who  are  coming\r\n\r\nback from working life in order to upgrade themselves.  And that\r\n\r\nis  the kind of society that we must become, the kind of culture\r\n\r\nthat  we must have.  Never stop learning.  Always have a  child-like curiosity for what is new, and try.  Fail, never mind;  try\r\n\r\nagain.   Fail again, never mind; try again.  In the  end,  learn\r\n\r\nsomething.   And  if  we cannot master these  skills  ourselves,\r\n\r\nencourage  our  younger  brothers  or  sisters,  encourage   our\r\n\r\nchildren  and grandchildren to master them, because it  is  good\r\n\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are preparing for something which we know will come, in\r\n\r\nthe  21st  century,  when  wealth  is  increasingly  based  upon\r\n\r\nknowledge, not land or raw materials or natural resources but on\r\n\r\nhuman  minds  and the knowledge in those human minds  and  their\r\n\r\nability  to network together.  This is why we have been  pushing\r\n\r\nIT; we have been pushing Singapore One and encouraging our young\r\n\r\nchildren to prepare themselves for that kind of a world.   Then,\r\n\r\nhowever  that  world changes, you will still come up  against  a\r\n\r\ncomputer,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyou  will still come up against Windows; you will still come  up\r\n\r\nagainst  Internet,  and  you  make  the  necessary  adjustments.\r\n\r\nWhether in a restaurant, in a bank, in a shopping centre, in the\r\n\r\nSAF,  whatever,  it  does not matter.  Put  someone  before  the\r\n\r\ncomputer  screen  and he is there hammering away,  no  sense  of\r\n\r\nbeing intimidated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other things that we should do too, like\r\n\r\nencouraging entrepreneurship and so on.  These are all long-term\r\n\r\nefforts.   If we can make 1% improvement a year, we  would  have\r\n\r\ndone  well.  It is not something which will change the situation\r\n\r\nrapidly.  EDB has mounted an Industry 21 programme which targets\r\n\r\nnot  just  manufacturing  but also  manufacturing  services.   I\r\n\r\nannounced some of the details in June this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our corporations will also have to restructure. We must\r\n\r\nhelp them to restructure.  We must not, through threats or moral\r\n\r\npressure,  make  it more difficult for them to restructure.   Dr\r\n\r\nLee  Tsao  Yuan talked about POSB.  Why not we slow the  process\r\n\r\ndown,  make it easier for those who have loans from POSB and  so\r\n\r\non?    Yes,   in  every  case,  it  is  better  to   hold   back\r\n\r\nrestructuring.   But there is also a heavy price  when  we  hold\r\n\r\nback  restructuring. Because every year lost is a year  lost  to\r\n\r\ncompetitors.  And at a time like this, I do not think  that  our\r\n\r\ninstinct  should  be  to  hold things  in  place,  but  to  help\r\n\r\nindividuals, corporations make the adjustments.  But whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  POSB can lengthen by a year the grace period, that  is  for\r\n\r\nPOSB  to decide.  But we must remember that, at the end  of  the\r\n\r\nday, all restructuring is difficult.  It is never easy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important things that we should pay\r\n\r\nattention  to in this period is to fight political  pressure  to\r\n\r\nmake life more difficult for foreign talent and foreign workers.\r\n\r\nAt  a  time  like this, the easiest thing to do and to  say  is,\r\n\r\n\"Let's  keep the foreigners out.  Save the jobs for Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  treat it as a zero sum game.\"  And at the political  rally,\r\n\r\non  a  soapbox, one can make quite a stirring speech.  Our trade\r\n\r\nunionists can make\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquite  a  stirring  speech on this.  Therefore,  at  a  critical\r\n\r\nperiod like this, it is very important that all of us, PAP  MPs,\r\n\r\nOpposition MPs, NMPs, all of us, hold to this position  that  we\r\n\r\nneed foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not have these foreign workers, our economy will\r\n\r\nseize  up.   Let  us  say, for electronics  companies,  40%  are\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  Without that 40%, there will be  no  60%  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  is  it not?  Without foreign  workers,  who  will\r\n\r\nbuild our homes, our MRT line, who will repair our ships?  There\r\n\r\nare  many areas which Singaporeans would not want to do even  if\r\n\r\nthey  are quite hard up.  And we need foreign workers for  those\r\n\r\njobs.   And  at  all  times,  there  are  imbalances.   We  need\r\n\r\nmachinists, we need computer programmers, we need restaurateurs,\r\n\r\nand  so  on,  bring them in.  Of course, where a Singaporean  is\r\n\r\nequal  to  a  foreigner,  prefer  the  Singaporean,  choose  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  We do not have to say this.  Instinctively,  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  employer, for reasons of cultural  affinity,  would\r\n\r\nprefer  a  Singaporean.   If he has to choose  between  whom  to\r\n\r\nretrench,  a  Singaporean or a foreigner, and they are  more  or\r\n\r\nless the same, I have no doubts in my mind that he will retrench\r\n\r\nthe  foreigner, not the Singaporean.  So I do not think this  is\r\n\r\nsuch a serious problem.  But we must not allow this issue to  be\r\n\r\npoliticised or polemicised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we talk about foreign talents, it is even more\r\n\r\nimportant.   Our  universities,  our  research  institutes,  our\r\n\r\nfinancial  sector, in many areas, without foreigners, we  cannot\r\n\r\nmaintain this high level of performance.  In fact, at the higher\r\n\r\nreaches, the majority may have to be foreigners.  If you look at\r\n\r\nthe  economy of London, or the economy of Tokyo, or the  economy\r\n\r\nof  New York, how many are local to London or New York or Tokyo.\r\n\r\nIf  you  tell  the  City  of London that you  can  only  recruit\r\n\r\nLondoners, I think the City of London might as well pack up.  So\r\n\r\nin  the same way, to maintain the kind of economy that we  have,\r\n\r\nwe  have  got  to  have a free flow of talents  coming  in  from\r\n\r\noutside, and this is very important.  But as I said, this  is  a\r\n\r\nsubject  on which it is very easy to make stirring speeches  and\r\n\r\nget the ground worked up in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTherefore  it is incumbent upon all of us who have  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to hold this ground because on  it  depends  our\r\n\r\nlong-term   survival   and   the   long-term   employment    and\r\n\r\nemployability of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS, OCBC, you notice recently, having to restructure and\r\n\r\nadjust  to a new situation, both of them have recruited  foreign\r\n\r\nCEOs.  Should we stop them?  That would be stupid, would it not?\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  I  will go a step further.  All over the region  now,\r\n\r\nbright,  able, dynamic entrepreneurial people have gone bankrupt\r\n\r\nor are without jobs.  Should we not, selectively, encourage some\r\n\r\nof  them  to come into Singapore so that when the tide comes  in\r\n\r\nagain,  we will have a thick layer of entrepreneurs and  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  to take our economy even further into the next  century?\r\n\r\nIf  Hong Kong, in 1949, did not get that outflow of talent  from\r\n\r\nShanghai,  and  Hong  Kong in 1949 was  not  a  very  prosperous\r\n\r\neconomy, would Hong Kong have done as well as it did?  If Taiwan\r\n\r\ndid  not  get  the one million mainlanders, would the  Taiwanese\r\n\r\nhave  achieved  that kind of progress which they achieved?   The\r\n\r\none  million was the cream of a whole continent.  So  we  should\r\n\r\nhave  the instinct and the wisdom at a time like this to welcome\r\n\r\nforeign talent into Singapore so that when times improve  again,\r\n\r\nwe will take off in double quick time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the key to all this is political unity and social\r\n\r\ncohesion, a point raised by almost all MPs this afternoon.  This\r\n\r\ncrisis  will  put  our society under stress.  It  will  put  our\r\n\r\ninstitutions  under  stress,  it  will  put  corporations  under\r\n\r\nstress,  it will put every family under some kind of stress.   I\r\n\r\ndo not think any family is unaffected by it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we have welfare? I listened to Mr Lim Boon Heng\r\n\r\nyesterday  saying  that we should not have a  retrenchment  fund\r\n\r\nbecause  this can impede our long-term competitiveness.   And  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  are  very lucky that, in Singapore, the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement understands this profoundly.  If we have welfarism  and\r\n\r\nget ourselves into the European position, then we are sowing the\r\n\r\nseeds  of  future  problems for years and years  to  come.   The\r\n\r\nEuropean economies are doing quite well now, but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  unemployment levels remain stubbornly at well  over  10%.\r\n\r\nWhy  is this?  Because of overly generous retrenchment benefits.\r\n\r\nThere  is a tremendous moral hazard involved.  So we must  guard\r\n\r\nagainst  this.   We can have welfare, yes.  If a breadwinner  is\r\n\r\nunemployed, children need school books, school fees,  assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  MCD,  yes,  help  him, help him to get  a  job,  help  the\r\n\r\nchildren  remain in school, do his examinations, get jobs  later\r\n\r\non.   And  in  every CDC now, we have a whole slew of programmes\r\n\r\nthrough  various  NGOs and grassroots organisations  to  provide\r\n\r\nhelp.   During  the boom years, I think many of us,  in  various\r\n\r\nconstituencies, had to go around persuading children to take  up\r\n\r\nbursaries  and  scholarships.  Maybe in the coming  years,  they\r\n\r\nwill come on their own.  But I think we have the programmes  and\r\n\r\nif  we  need  many more such programmes, so be it.   But  always\r\n\r\nwatch the moral hazard and do not allow an attitude of welfarism\r\n\r\nto  seep in, then it is by right, and if you do not give  me,  I\r\n\r\nwill  vote  against  you.   Because once  we  settle  into  that\r\n\r\nposition, it is well-nigh impossible to get out of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we done poorly? Mr Low Thia Khiang said that we\r\n\r\ndiscriminated against certain Singaporeans.  Mr Chiam  See  Tong\r\n\r\nsaid that we discriminated against his kite fliers and that  his\r\n\r\nMPS  is  conducted  in  the void deck  instead  of  in  an  air-conditioned  room.    If you look at the bottom  5%  to  10%  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans of any race, we are far better off than  any  other\r\n\r\ncity  in  the world.  Our bottom 5%-10% are better looked  after\r\n\r\nthan  the  corresponding groups in Tokyo, or New  York,  or  Los\r\n\r\nAngeles,  anywhere in the world. And it is because of this  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  socially very stable.  Yes, in minor things, these  are\r\n\r\npart  of  the rough-and-tumble of democratic politics.   But  on\r\n\r\nmajor  things,  we  provide a solid base  for  all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nregardless of race, language, religion or political affiliation.\r\n\r\nMr Chiam knows this.  When he talked about fires in Potong Pasir\r\n\r\nnot  being fought by the Fire Brigade, or crimes in Potong Pasir\r\n\r\nignored  by  the Police, he knew he was joking.  If he  was  not\r\n\r\njoking, I say we should have a proper debate in this House and a\r\n\r\nproper Commission of Inquiry for the Fire Service\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand the Police Department.  It was a joke and we should take  it\r\n\r\nin that spirit and not pursue the matter much further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at a time like this when economic conditions are hard,\r\n\r\nhuman societies turn inwards.  Mrs Lim Hwee Hua talked about how\r\n\r\nher  friends complained to her about the $5 billion aid we  gave\r\n\r\nto the Indonesians.  There is a lot of carping, \"If you can give\r\n\r\nIndonesians $5 billion, why cannot you help me?\"  To begin with,\r\n\r\nlet  us  get  the facts right.  That $5 billion  have  not  been\r\n\r\ndisbursed  because the IMF programme under which we  rode  along\r\n\r\nhas  not  been implemented.  We are helping Indonesia  in  other\r\n\r\nways,  through  trade  financing, humanitarian  assistance,  our\r\n\r\ninvestment in natural gas, by maintaining operations  in  Batam,\r\n\r\nBintan and the Riau Islands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it right at a time like this for Singaporeans also to\r\n\r\nturn  inwards and ignore our neighbours?  I think that would  be\r\n\r\nwrong   because   we  are  then  sowing  seeds   for   long-term\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   How  can we turn our back  because  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwant  help?  The majority of Indonesian workers earn  less  than\r\n\r\nS$1 a day to support an entire family.  Their future is in their\r\n\r\nown hands.  There is not very much we can do to help.  But if we\r\n\r\ncan help in small ways, we should, and we are.  There is nothing\r\n\r\nwrong with that and we should not be defensive about it.  It  is\r\n\r\nin  our  own  enlightened self-interest to help  our  neighbours\r\n\r\nbecause our destinies are intertwined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, I hear some MPs talk about some of\r\n\r\nour  Malaysian  friends making unkind remarks  against  us.   We\r\n\r\nshould  be  principled and firm.  We should  not  be  taken  for\r\n\r\ngranted.  And at a time like this, Singaporeans should have  the\r\n\r\ninstinct  to bunch together.  Last week, a friend of  mine  from\r\n\r\nthe SAF, he used to be a senior doctor in the SAF, called me up.\r\n\r\nHe  said,  \"I  want to see you urgently.\"  I said, \"Come,  let's\r\n\r\nhave lunch together.\"  He was very unhappy because he works in a\r\n\r\nprivate hospital and in the doctor's room, one Singaporean  came\r\n\r\nin and railed against the Singapore Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  being difficult with Malaysia.  He said that we should just\r\n\r\ngive  in.   CPF, return it.  CIQ, why do you want  to  make  all\r\n\r\nthese  changes?   This friend of mine was  so  angry.   We  were\r\n\r\nfriends  in the SAF for many years.  He said he gave him  a  40-minute lecture and all the other Singaporeans in the common room\r\n\r\nbecame  very  encouraged, and some of them also spoke  up.   The\r\n\r\nMalaysian doctors in the room kept quiet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time like this, it is crucial that we bunch together,\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  the  instinct that,  \"Look,  we  must  help  our\r\n\r\nneighbours,  but in a way which is proper and principled.\"   And\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  assume that this regional crisis will  not  lead  to\r\n\r\npolitical  crisis in various parts of the region.   Many  things\r\n\r\ncan  go  wrong.   The horrible events of May in  Indonesia  were\r\n\r\ntriggered  off  by  the  regional economic  crisis.   Other  bad\r\n\r\nthings, other evil things can happen in the region.  We have got\r\n\r\nto  be careful, we have got to be mentally prepared for it.   We\r\n\r\ncannot turn inwards.  The other day, I was very cheered.  I  was\r\n\r\ntalking  to  Teo Chee Hean about the SAF.  He told me  that  the\r\n\r\nmorale  of  the senior SAF officers is very high.  I  felt  very\r\n\r\ngood  about it because if, at a time like this, our SAF officers\r\n\r\nare weak-kneed, then we might as well pack up and go, is it not?\r\n\r\nWe  have got to, especially at a time like this, go out  of  our\r\n\r\nway to help those who are in difficulties but to help them in  a\r\n\r\nway which does not create long-term problems for ourselves.  And\r\n\r\nI think on the whole, Singaporeans have that instinct.  There is\r\n\r\na certain resilience which our people have got.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NEE Exhibition has been a tremendous success. I have\r\n\r\nnot  heard  a  single negative remark about the Exhibition.   We\r\n\r\nextended  it  by  six  days but within one  afternoon,  all  the\r\n\r\ntickets  were  snapped up.  Why is this?   It  is  because  when\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  look  back  upon  their  past,  upon  what   their\r\n\r\nforefathers have done, what an earlier generation of leaders had\r\n\r\nbrought  us through, they felt proud and their morale  went  up,\r\n\r\nand we must build upon this.  And what we really must have is  a\r\n\r\ncertain spirit of resilience, pak buay see (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) kind of\r\n\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHowever the situation turns, we will survive; we will find a way\r\n\r\nto prevail; we will find a way to compete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said at a time like this, Ministers\r\n\r\nshould  take  a pay cut.  I am glad to tell Mr Low  Thia  Khiang\r\n\r\nthat  Ministers  will take a pay cut because  our  salaries  are\r\n\r\npegged.  The salaries in the private sector have gone down  and,\r\n\r\nwith  a time lag, Superscale salaries will also go down.  So  he\r\n\r\nneed not be too worried about this subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

We must be prepared for what can  become  a\r\n\r\nlong  haul, all working together, all at battle station,  alert,\r\n\r\nGovernment, employers, trade unionists, social workers,  looking\r\n\r\nafter  each other.  If someone falls over, a lifeboat;  a  dent,\r\n\r\nquick repair; a leak, plug it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will there be seven years of famine? I hope not. But can\r\n\r\nwe  be sure?  And should we be so reckless as to say, \"Let us in\r\n\r\none  decisive  move raise this boat when the  tide  is  ebbing.\"\r\n\r\nSome  friends  have  told me, they said,  \"Government  has  been\r\n\r\nsaying reserves are for a rainy day.  Now there is a storm.  Now\r\n\r\nis  the time to spend the reserves.\"  The storm has just started\r\n\r\nand  we have got to husband our resources carefully.  And if  we\r\n\r\ndo  it  carefully, not losing our nerves, but with a quiet sense\r\n\r\nof  self-possession and self-confidence, we will sail this boat,\r\n\r\nposition  it well and when the tide comes in again, we  will  be\r\n\r\nfar ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will take some knocks. There will be casualties and a\r\n\r\nfew  Singaporeans may even lose heart and leave  Singapore.   In\r\n\r\nthe  1985-86 recession, we had a small outflow.  And  this  time\r\n\r\nround, there may be a small outflow again.  But the majority  of\r\n\r\nus,  I think, will stay and we will bunch together and keep this\r\n\r\nboat chugging along and prepare for a new situation.  When sweet\r\n\r\nand  gentle  breezes  return again, the  region  will  not  look\r\n\r\nanything\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlike  what  it  was  before last year.  The  landscape  will  be\r\n\r\ndifferent.  We cannot be sure.  We cannot have a fixed plan that\r\n\r\nwe  must be there or here, because things are changing so  fast.\r\n\r\nBut we know the general direction we must move towards.  We know\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  free  lunch in the world.   We  know  that  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean will have to carry his own weight.  We know that  we\r\n\r\nhave got to be competitive and that is the only sure way to stay\r\n\r\nemployed and to stay employable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion. [Applause].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to thank all the Members who have spoken up on  this\r\n\r\nmotion.  I would like to acknowledge their contribution and  key\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will go in the reverse order. Mr Chiam See Tong and\r\n\r\nMr Low Thia Khiang, basically, called on the Government to treat\r\n\r\neverybody  fairly  and  equally  so  as  to  strengthen   social\r\n\r\ncohesion, and we have heard the response from the Minister.  NMP\r\n\r\nMr  Chuang  talked  about the over investment  in  the  property\r\n\r\nmarket  and the need to divert this investment in the future  to\r\n\r\nhuman  capital.   NMP Mr Rai talked about the  need  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nworkers  so  that  they can take on better paying  jobs  and  he\r\n\r\ncalled  on  the  people to save more.  Mdm Claire Chiang  talked\r\n\r\nabout the importance of the people services sector and the  need\r\n\r\nto  strengthen the social safety net, and to set up a  Singapore\r\n\r\nmisery index.  Mr Inderjit Singh talked about the need to have a\r\n\r\nvibrant business environment for technology and innovation-based\r\n\r\neconomy.  I like that very much.  Dr Vasoo talked about the need\r\n\r\nto  have a fighting spirit and the need to do long-term manpower\r\n\r\nplanning,  if  possible, for the next 20 years.  I thought  that\r\n\r\nwas  excellent too.  NMP Mr Zulkifli talked about  the  need  to\r\n\r\nmatch  the VWOs, the social workers, to the needs of the  people\r\n\r\nat  a time like this.  Mr Ang Mong Seng talked about the need to\r\n\r\nset  up an employment network linking MOM, CDCs, CCs and so  on.\r\n\r\nNMP  Mr  Tay talked about the need to give more support  to  the\r\n\r\nSMEs and to have a stronger process of consultation with the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  Mr Sinnakaruppan proposed the earlier  release\r\n\r\nof  the report on CET 21.  NMP Dr Lee Tsao Yuan talked about the\r\n\r\nneed  for early and big enough off-Budget measures.  And,  first\r\n\r\nbut  not  least, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Mr Seng Han  Thong  talked\r\n\r\nabout  the  older workers, skills upgrading, cost  cutting,  job\r\n\r\nmatching,  unity and so on.  And I thank all the MPs  for  their\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to thank the Second Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  BG  George Yeo, for his very spirited  and  inspiring\r\n\r\nresponse.   I  am very glad that he talked about  the  need  for\r\n\r\nemployment,  employability, competitiveness and national  unity.\r\n\r\nI  am  most  impressed by his pak buay see kind of reply  and  I\r\n\r\nguess  some  of the MPs here are also the pak buay see  type  of\r\n\r\nMPs.   So  if  your  proposal  has not  been  responded  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister, please continue to bring them up on a future  occasion\r\n\r\nuntil some response comes out with a yes or no, whatever way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to summarise my motion\r\n\r\nin  this  way.   I  think  Mr Low Thia Khiang  also  asked  this\r\n\r\nquestion  about moving this motion at a time like this.   Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause the PAP Government admits making mistakes and so on?   I\r\n\r\nwant  to  explain.  The one and only reason why I proposed  this\r\n\r\nparticular motion at a time like this is because I remember what\r\n\r\na Chinese businessman told me about five years ago.  The Chinese\r\n\r\nbusinessman  was very successful in China.  I hope he  still  is\r\n\r\nbecause I have not been in touch with him for quite a while now.\r\n\r\nI  asked  him, \"How did you manage to be so successful?  Somehow\r\n\r\neverywhere  you went, you made money, when other people  may  be\r\n\r\nlosing money.\"  He said, \"Very simple.  Zui wei xian de di fang,\r\n\r\nye     shi     zui     an     quan     de     di     fang      [\r\n\r\n],  meaning  that  the most dangerous place is also  the  safest\r\n\r\nplace.  Why?  Very simple.  If the place is very safe, everybody\r\n\r\nrushes  in.  The place will be so crowded and the market is  not\r\n\r\nenough  to go round everyone.  So in the end there is no winner,\r\n\r\nbecause they all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nundercut  each other.  What he did was he went to  places  where\r\n\r\nnobody  dared to be there, because it was known to be dangerous.\r\n\r\nThis is dangerous from a business point of view, not in terms of\r\n\r\nphysical safety.  Basically, he was a pioneer.  He looked around\r\n\r\nChina.   He looked at the provinces, the cities and places  that\r\n\r\nhe  thought  there  were investment opportunities.   But  before\r\n\r\nanybody  else moved in, he moved in first.  Because of that,  he\r\n\r\nwas able to basically make a good business out of that venture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think for Singapore, in terms of the national economy,\r\n\r\nit  is  the  same thing.  I think we have been taking risks  all\r\n\r\nthese 35 years since independence and that is the reason why our\r\n\r\neconomy  has  been  successful.   We  went  to  foreign   direct\r\n\r\ninvestment  (FDI) when many people, many countries, thought  FDI\r\n\r\nis  no good for the country.  They say it will enable the multi-national  companies  to come in to exploit our  people  and  our\r\n\r\nresources.   But we said, no.  We say that it is  dangerous  but\r\n\r\nalso the safest.  So we went to FDI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's situation has changed. Looking ahead, in the\r\n\r\nfuture,  as I mentioned, I think the Minister has also mentioned\r\n\r\nabout  the realignment of the regional currencies. The  economic\r\n\r\nspace  that we are in today is going to be very crowded  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture,  by the time the crisis is over.  Therefore, we have  to\r\n\r\nlook  for new space, space that is even more dangerous  and  has\r\n\r\nfewer players so that we can continue to succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is very easy for our regional economies to copy us.\r\n\r\nThey  can  copy our strategies on paper but it is very difficult\r\n\r\nfor them to duplicate the implementation on the ground if we are\r\n\r\nprepared  not to shy away from greater and difficult  challenges\r\n\r\nand,  in  a way, more dangerous places.  But to survive in  more\r\n\r\ndangerous places, we better be stronger and better, and that  is\r\n\r\nthe only reason why I proposed this motion because I think at  a\r\n\r\ntime  like  this,  instead of being bogged  down  by  short-term\r\n\r\nproblems,  we should cast our mind, our vision, ahead or  beyond\r\n\r\nthis  crisis,  and ask ourselves what can we do  now  over  this\r\n\r\nyear, the next two years or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthree  years,   what  can we do to make Singapore  stronger  and\r\n\r\nbetter.  So that by the time the crisis is over, when we have to\r\n\r\nventure into more dangerous places, we will be ready and we will\r\n\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me in conclusion, as the Minister BG George Yeo\r\n\r\nhas mentioned, at a time like this, there is a lot of stress,  a\r\n\r\nlot  of ya li [               ].  There is a Chinese saying,  we\r\n\r\nmust       ba     ya    li,    ding    wei     dong     li     [\r\n\r\n],  meaning you must turn the stress, the pressure, into forward\r\n\r\nthrust so that we can run even faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, let me thank again the House for the\r\n\r\nsupport of this motion and I look forward to your approval.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, in view of the economic downturn, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  rally  the  support  of the entire  nation  to  minimise\r\n\r\nunemployment   in   the  short  term  and  strengthen   economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and social cohesion for the long  term  so  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  emerge  from this  regional  crisis  even  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive and resilient.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Six minutes past Six o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SOUTH ASIAN STUDIES PROGRAMME</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr S Iswaran</b> asked the Minister for Education what progress\r\n\r\nhas been made on the introduction of a South Asian Studies\r\n\r\nprogramme at the National University of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Aline Wong announced in Parliament in January 1998 that\r\n\r\nNUS had found it feasible to start the South Asian Studies\r\n\r\nProgramme (SASP) from the Academic Year 1999/2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NUS is making good progress in the preparations and will be\r\n\r\nready to launch the SASP from July 1999.  Let me update Members\r\n\r\non the key steps in the preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the curriculum. A committee comprising historians,\r\n\r\neconomists, political scientists and sociologists started\r\n\r\ndeveloping the curriculum from late 1997.  They have sought the\r\n\r\nadvice and inputs from local and international experts on South\r\n\r\nAsia.  The draft curriculum is now ready and will be finalised\r\n\r\nby the end of this year, after getting feedback, including\r\n\r\nfeedback from potential students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the recruitment of staff. The Programme has\r\n\r\nprovisions for five full time academic staff.  NUS is currently\r\n\r\nin the process of identifying and attracting good scholars to\r\n\r\ntake up these teaching positions.  Advertisements have been\r\n\r\nplaced in leading journals and academic magazines in South Asia,\r\n\r\nUK, USA and Australia.  NUS intends to hold recruitment visits\r\n\r\nto these regions later this year.  It expects these posts to be\r\n\r\nfilled by early 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, marketing. NUS will be conducting a series of\r\n\r\npublicity activities, including seminars and public talks, to\r\n\r\npromote the Programme from January and June 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HISTORY SYLLABUS OF SCHOOLS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Education if he\r\n\r\nwill consider reviewing the History syllabus of schools to give\r\n\r\ngreater emphasis to post-war history of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, pupils at the lower secondary level are taught\r\n\r\nSingapore's history from the colonial era till our achievement\r\n\r\nof nationhood in 1965.
