'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, on <st1:date Month=\"2\" Day=\"23\" Year=\"2004\">23rd February 2004</st1:date>, Active Training Wing (ATW) of Armour Training Centre (ATC) conducted a live firing at the range in Area 'D' as part of the unit's course syllabus to practise the gunners in their gunnery skills and knowledge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the night live firing, at about 2000 hours, there was a stoppage in one of the 0.5 inch calibre Machine Guns.&nbsp;&nbsp;The gunner carried out the prescribed immediate action drill, but was unable to rectify the stoppage.&nbsp; The bolt of the gun was stuck in the forward position.&nbsp; The Chief Safety Officer and the vehicle Safety Officer were informed of the incident, and tried unsuccessfully to rectify the problem. &nbsp;The weapon was then left <I>in-situ</I> facing the range targets until the end of the live firing session.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the live firing, the Chief Safety Officer and the vehicle Safety Officer tried again to rectify the problem, but were unsuccessful.&nbsp; They mistakenly assessed that the weapon was clear of ammunition and deemed it safe to be brought back to the armoury in camp when, in fact, there was a round lodged in the chamber.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At about 1100 hours on <st1:date Month=\"2\" Day=\"24\" Year=\"2004\">24th February 2004</st1:date>, an Officer and three Specialists drew out the weapon from the armoury with the intent of rectifying the stoppage.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 552<p>They tried to rectify the jammed weapon without knowing that there was a round in the chamber.&nbsp; In the course of doing so, there was an&nbsp;explosion in&nbsp;the chamber of the machine gun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The preliminary investigations ascertained the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there was a current lesson plan for the conduct of the live firing, and the live firing at the range was conducted in accordance&nbsp;with the lesson plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incorrect procedures were adopted by the two Officers at the range to check whether the jammed weapon was free from any ammunition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The actions taken to rectify the jammed weapon after it was brought back to the unit were also incorrect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards medical coverage, there was proper medical coverage in the unit and the evacuation procedure was prompt and correct.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four servicemen, a Regular and three Full-time National Servicemen, were hurt as a result of this incident.&nbsp; One of the National Servicemen was required to undergo an operation to remove fragments from his eyes sustained from the exploded weapon.&nbsp; He has been discharged from the hospital, and&nbsp;is recuperating at home.&nbsp; The remaining three servicemen sustained minor injuries and were treated as outpatients.&nbsp; All four servicemen will have their medical condition reviewed by the medical specialists over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Board of Inquiry has since been convened to investigate the circumstances leading to this incident.&nbsp; Disciplinary action will be taken against individuals found to be negligent or to have contravened the established procedures and safety regulations leading to this incident.</p></div></span><p align=left>Column: 553<p><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New

with such a situation is that if a gun stops and there is a round in the&nbsp;chamber or it is assessed that&nbsp;there is a possibility of a round in the chamber, the gun should be left <I>in-situ</I>.&nbsp; The armourer should come to the range and clear the weapon and rectify the fault <I>in-situ</I>.&nbsp; The officers incorrectly assessed that there was no round in the chamber

style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):&nbsp;</B><p align=left>Column: 554<p> Mr Speaker, Sir, the objective of the public housing programme is to provide affordable housing for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Home ownership remains the key mission of public housing, as it gives Singaporeans an asset and a stake in the nation.&nbsp; As our home ownership policy is premised on the family as the basic unit of society, the existence of a family unit remains one of the basic eligibility conditions for the&nbsp;purchase of an HDB flat. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last four decades, the Government has successfully housed more than 80% of Singaporeans in HDB estates, and enabled over 90% of Singapore households to become home-owners.&nbsp; Nonetheless, there is still a need to provide for the housing needs of the new households that are formed each year, some of whom will have to turn to HDB for a flat.&nbsp; The Government will ensure that affordable public housing continues to remain available to them.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single citizens are considered as part of a family unit and are encouraged to live together with their families for mutual support and care. &nbsp;Therefore, a single child forming a family unit with his parents is eligible to purchase any type of HDB flat.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Government recognises that there are some older Singaporeans who remain single and who prefer to live on their own.&nbsp; To meet the housing needs of this group, HDB has implemented two housing schemes for citizen singles who are 35 years old or older.&nbsp; Under the Joint Singles (JS) Scheme, two or more singles can jointly buy any type of resale flat, while under the Single Singapore Citizen (SSC) Scheme, a single can purchase a 3-room or smaller resale flat alone.&nbsp; Eligible singles can also enjoy a housing grant of $11,000 or $22,000 under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme and the Joint Singles schemes respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 555<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, singles are already recognised under our home ownership policy. &nbsp;We will continue to review our housing policies for singles regularly to ensure that they remain fair and relevant.&nbsp;</p></div></span><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Our GPC wishes to sincerely thank all the participants for their contributions in the dialogue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's Budget is said to be a continuation of past years' budgets.&nbsp; To some extent, this is true.&nbsp; As declared in past Budget announcements, the Government would implement the 2% cut of corporate tax by 2005,&nbsp;and it is implemented.&nbsp; In previous Budgets, the statements mainly covered the details of the Government's revenues and expenditures, before rounding up with the tax and fiscal policies and changes.&nbsp;

including the Government's long-term plans on the three main pillars of Singapore, which are effective Government, strong society and land of<p align=left>Column: 559<p> opportunity.&nbsp; In this regard, I view this year's Budget as a very important milestone document, and the plans of the Government in the medium and long term are outlined at some length.&nbsp; It is not a mere short-term annual Budget announcement.&nbsp; It therefore reads almost like the Presidential Address at the start of each session of Parliament.&nbsp; The subjects are wide ranging and have long-term implications.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this year's Budget not only touches on budget and tax matters, but covers societal issues and portrays Singapore as a land of opportunity, I shall therefore set out my comments in the same sequence as in the Budget, that is, in the order of (1) effective Government; (2) strong society; and (3) land of opportunity.&nbsp; With the stated plans on these three key pillars, the crux of the matter is how can the Government bring all the people along this path of well-being,&nbsp;wealth, and enlightenment in the land of opportunity.&nbsp; Carrying everybody along is going to be a monumental task to reach this fabulous promised land.&nbsp; The question is how to get there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on effective Government.&nbsp; On the first pillar on effective Government, DPM Lee has enunciated the means to attain effective Government, which is through sound public finance, living within our means and service delivery.&nbsp; However, I feel that the basic tenet of effective Government is mainly the people - people make the Government and the civil service.&nbsp; Therefore, we need to have both strong Government leaders as well as an effective civil service.&nbsp; All great plans and great schemes will come to nought if there is a weak or corrupt government and ineffective and bungling civil servants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the next step is how to remake the civil service such that it is <p align=left>Column: 560<p>enterprising, innovative and ready to consider and accept new ideas and new approaches.&nbsp; Getting good people in the civil service is therefore of fundamental importance.&nbsp; Generally, we agree that Singapore has an enviable strong civil service.&nbsp; As Mr Ngiam Tong Dow, a respected retired top civil servant, said:&nbsp; \"In our years of budgetary abundance, we have often mistaken form for substance ... headquarters of Ministries and statutory boards, have been built to heights of elegance more than what their functions require ...&nbsp; As I drive by these gleaming glass palaces, I often wonder whether the learning, teaching and research match the grandeur of the buildings ... in old Fullerton Building described as dark and dim.&nbsp; Its saving grace was that there were some bright minds working in it.\"&nbsp; I think we need to remake the civil service.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need for mindset change.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, initiatives like the \"Pro-enterprise Panel\" and \"Cut Waste Committee\" have resulted in drawing the civil servants closer to the reality of the ground sentiments.&nbsp; Civil servants are rectifying some of the adverse results of Government rules and practices.&nbsp; However, I am still disappointed that often, when faced with a certain new idea or appeal for flexibility on the application of rules which they cannot handle, the civil servants would often fall back on a convenient refrain: \"If I allow you this flexibility of rule, then I have to allow everybody else.\"&nbsp; My retort is that if the rule change is good for my case, what is then wrong for it to be made applicable for all cases?&nbsp; This will be met with a finality: \"No, no, no.&nbsp; We cannot do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be rather chaotic then.\"&nbsp; As a result, a great idea is killed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>More interactions with the ground</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think that what we need is to get the mighty civil servants to come down from their ivory tower and have more<p align=left>Column: 561<p> opportunity to mix with the ground.&nbsp; I believe the Government is already doing that.&nbsp; Perhaps just not enough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall that many years ago, when I was doing my MBA in Insead, France, my Japanese coursemate told me one day in elation that he had been assigned to take care of the Christmas tree decorations back in the office, when he returned for the Christmas holiday.&nbsp; I was surprised, as decorating the Christmas tree was a menial task.&nbsp; But my Japanese friend said: \"No, our present Chairman had also been assigned to the task of taking care of the Christmas tree when he was a junior officer.&nbsp; Hence, being given this task is of great importance and significance!\"&nbsp; Actually, by being involved in such a mundane task, he had the opportunity to understand ground sentiments of the company better.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time for our top civil servants to come down from their high chairs and try their hand at decorating the Christmas tree!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest that it should be made an essential part of their training that civil servants should spend some time in&nbsp;an overseas assignment (for example, in India, China or elsewhere), as well as spend some time in an operational enterprise or even the private sector to enable them to have a more rounded experience and exposure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly heartened to read in the recent <I>Straits Times</I> series on \"Recruit - Scholars' Choice 1 to 3\".&nbsp; I read the Friday, 5th March 2004, report of the typical example of Mr Simon Ng, aged 26.&nbsp; He is a recipient of the Overseas Merit Scholarship awarded by the PSC.&nbsp; After three years at the Imperial College, London, and a year at Stanford University in USA, he went on to spend another year working in China.&nbsp; This wide experience had moved him up the intellectual, cultural and personal levels.&nbsp; There are numerous other examples of such scholars, like Mr Simon Ng, who are getting excellent all-<p align=left>Column: 562<p>rounded exposure.&nbsp; I think it bodes well for our civil service to have such an excellent crop of future recruits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Creating \"Bureaupreneurs\" out of current corps of civil servants</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I am not sure whether our current crop of middle and senior civil servants has gone through enough of such multi-faceted exposure.&nbsp; The world is fast changing and fast moving.&nbsp; If we want to remake Singapore, we have also got to remake the civil service.&nbsp; We need civil servants who are responsive, innovative and prepared to accept change.&nbsp; Perhaps, instead of calling them \"bureaucrats\", we can coin a new term for them to insert an \"entrepreneurial\" element in it.&nbsp; Maybe, we can call them \"bureaupreneurs\" - people who can turn the civil service into an enterprising and responsive organisation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Butterfly Effect</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am supportive of DPM Lee's intention to permanently cut by 2% the budget caps of all Ministries, except MINDEF,&nbsp;in FY 2004 and another 2% in FY 2005.&nbsp; This is a very commendable move indeed.&nbsp; However, I just wish to forewarn DPM Lee of the \"Butterfly Effect\" of such a small 2% cut.&nbsp; There is now a popular movie in the cinemas by the same name \"Butterfly Effect\".&nbsp; The Effect propounds&nbsp;the chaos theory, that the fluttering of the wings of a butterfly in, say,&nbsp; Africa, could cause a chain effect a month later that affects a tornado in USA, in another part of the world.&nbsp; An interesting&nbsp;theory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the Butterfly Effect in the Government budget, I mean to watch out for the rippling repercussions of the 2% cut through the Ministries. The small cut could end in very huge and some strange and diverse results.&nbsp; The 2% cut may look very innocuous, but this cut starting at one end of the Ministry's budget may<p align=left>Column: 563<p> result in multiple thousand cuts down the line in the operating agencies.&nbsp; I am more concerned that down the line, some very small but important social projects for the community or the poor may get chopped as a result.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I truly do not wish to see that the 2% cut for 2004 and another 2% for 2005 for each Ministry will&nbsp;result in numerous small cuts which are crucial in some meaningful and supportive projects for certain welfare organisations and programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>\"Hurry to Wait\" Syndrome&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I like to warn about the \"Hurry to Wait\" syndrome in the civil service.&nbsp; It might well happen if we do not watch closely.&nbsp; This is similar to the resultant phenomenon during each year's National Day Parade where most participants call it \"Hurry to Wait\".&nbsp; What it means is that while participants (some could be just young primary school children) are taking part in the 15-minute event in the Parade, say, at 7.00 pm, but because the commanders and the persons in charge want to be trebly sure that the participants are not late, each level of instruction adds 15 to 30 minutes of buffer time.&nbsp; By the time the designated time is given to the participants, they usually need to be at the Stadium by 3.00 pm in the afternoon.&nbsp; They are then \"Hurried to Wait\".&nbsp; It creates inefficiency and unnecessary inconvenience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Differentiate between citizens and PRs</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on to strong society, one of the major tenets of a strong society is a strong citizenry.&nbsp; By strong citizenry, I mean Singaporeans who have a strong love for their country, they have deep-rooted sentiments to preserve and protect the country, they have the care and concern for their fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 564<p> Naturally, such deep-rooted attachments cannot be fostered overnight.&nbsp; Singaporeans are very pragmatic people.&nbsp; If we want them to be proud Singaporeans, we should have a visible and definitive gap between the benefits of being citizens versus the benefits of being PRs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Better recognition and compensation for National Servicemen</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, many Singaporeans said they do not feel any better than the PRs, who live here and enjoy equal benefits of a clean and well-run city.&nbsp; In fact, many Singaporeans feel that they are disadvantaged due to the fact that&nbsp;legally, they themselves and their children have to do full time national service.&nbsp; They also have to do the yearly obligatory reservist stints thereafter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NSF and reservists do affect young Singaporeans' career advancement.&nbsp; They fall behind non-Singaporean colleagues by 2 1/2 years of seniority, their yearly reservist disruptions are frowned upon by employers.&nbsp; These are major sacrifices of male Singaporeans.&nbsp; To compensate, I would like to suggest that the Government should do a review of the salaries and compensations of NSF and reservists.&nbsp; Currently, NSF servicemen are relatively poorly paid.&nbsp; At least, they are less paid than their regular counterparts.&nbsp; So, why not equalise or narrow the gap between the pay of the reservists and the regulars, or the NSF and the regulars?&nbsp; Secondly, an arrangement should be put in place to recognise the 2 1/2 years of NSF as a seniority and annual increment comparison with non-Singaporean staff,&nbsp;in both the civil service and in the private sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe more could be done to demonstrate the benefits of Singapore citizens amply exceed those of PRs.&nbsp; The Government can set down the various benefits of Singaporeans, in terms of<p align=left>Column: 565<p> housing, medical, education, immigration and various other citizens' rights.&nbsp; Besides the definable benefits, which I call the pull factors, we should also look at the intangible issues of \"push factors\".&nbsp; Why are many Singaporeans emigrating?&nbsp; Some people said that they find Singapore too stifling and cloistered up.&nbsp; Is it true?&nbsp; There are numerous jokes about Singaporeans who do not open their mouths.&nbsp; We must do some honest introspection.&nbsp; Does merely allowing bar top dancing and reverse bungee jumps open up the sense of restrictive environment?&nbsp; What more can be done?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Dual citizenship</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we not revive the proposal to allow dual citizenship?&nbsp; Many countries which are open minded and progressive allow dual citizenship.&nbsp; Is there a genuine risk that allowing dual citizenship will facilitate the flight of good and capable Singaporeans, especially in time of crisis?&nbsp; Is that risk more of a function of&nbsp;how much we have ingrained into our young Singaporeans the sense of pride and love of the country?&nbsp; Would the benefit of dual citizenship outweigh the perceived risks?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I have been hesitant in the past about allowing dual citizenship.&nbsp; But now, I am thinking otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the more mobile and mass communication in the new world, Singaporeans with ability and talent will always be the target of foreign countries.&nbsp; Therefore, allowing them dual citizenship will in fact allow them to retain ties with Singapore.&nbsp; Conversely, allowing dual citizenship will enable us to attract more foreigners to take up citizenship, particularly&nbsp;when we have only 1.26 fertility replacement rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dual citizenship should be a sacred cow that is worth taking a relook.&nbsp; In the past, matters such as dual citizenship and casinos in Singapore are spoken about in hush tones in quiet corners, as though it is a great heresy to voice such subjects.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 566<p> Raising these subjects imply lack of patriotism.&nbsp; It should not be.&nbsp; I personally do not support the idea of casino in Singapore, but I think the dual citizenship idea deserves a relook.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Joining privileges of the Singapore Club</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to show to the PRs the&nbsp;plentiful benefits of being a Singaporean.&nbsp; It is quite a package of both tangible benefits and intangible attractions.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>These are so-called joining privileges.&nbsp; Being Singaporean should mean joining an \"exclusive club\".&nbsp; The target is to make it such that everybody is vying to join this \"Singapore Club\".<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst we want to attract more people to become Singaporeans, we must be mindful not to alienate certain segments of the people.&nbsp; As our society progresses, it is inevitable that some groups may feel marginalised.&nbsp; These are the poor, aged and under-privileged.&nbsp; There should be adequate attention and resources allocated to help these groups.&nbsp; Remember my earlier point about the \"Butterfly Effect\"?&nbsp; Do make sure that the 2% cut in budgets does not result in some benefits going to these groups being curtailed.&nbsp; The butterfly effect may cause some down-trodden people to be axed, if we are not careful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Care for the marginalised segments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, besides the old, aged and underprivileged, I wish to voice my concern on a special group.&nbsp; These are the people in the&nbsp;45-62 or so age group.&nbsp; They face an impact of treble whammies.&nbsp; First, those in this group will have their CPF reduced.&nbsp; Second, they may face pay cuts or retrenchments.&nbsp; Third, they will face higher medical and hospitalisation costs as they grow old.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many professionals in their 50s find that, because of changing circumstances, they are replaced or retrenched.&nbsp; Most of <p align=left>Column: 567<p>them are still able-bodied, with good minds and wide experience.&nbsp; They have some good years to run.&nbsp; Many are not finding employers who are prepared to give them full-time employment.&nbsp; As a fall-back and to preserve their&nbsp;dignity and pride, they go around carrying a card saying they are consultants.&nbsp; I strongly urge the Government to think of some schemes or mechanism to help the people in this group.&nbsp; Perhaps, there can be a central agency.&nbsp; This agency can match their professional skills and experience against prospective clients.&nbsp; The clients may need certain of these professionals on an ad-hoc or contractual basis.&nbsp; These professionals can be tasked to lead or join in local and overseas assignments.&nbsp; This pool of senior executives is growing.&nbsp; We have to find means to ensure that this useful and substantial resource pool is not put to waste.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Procreation policies</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A major part of the Budget Speech is devoted to the problem of procreation.&nbsp; Our Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has fallen to 1.26, below that of many foreign established nations.&nbsp; It is widely acknowledged that procreation and how to encourage young couples to marry earlier and have children earlier is a very complex and emotive issue.&nbsp; It requires a holistic approach.&nbsp; It is a big subject.&nbsp; I hear that many MPs will touch on this, especially our lady MPs.&nbsp; One report said that Dr Lily Neo has 28 ideas on how it could be done.&nbsp; Let us hear from her.&nbsp; Given such wide interest, I do not intend to dwell too deeply into this subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let this space be given to other more qualified persons, especially our female counterparts, to debate on it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wish to reflect on some concerns of employers that if we were to increase maternity leave to a longer period of six months, there is the worry of employers<p align=left>Column: 568<p>that besides heavier salary costs, there is the added problem of disruption to work schedules and of staff covering&nbsp;duties.&nbsp; This is an aspect that Mr Lim Hng Kiang and his study team have to consider when coming out with their recommendations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Land of opportunity</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his Budget Speech, DPM Lee stated that he sensed palpable optimism in the market.&nbsp; This view, in the short term, may be correct.&nbsp; In fact, all of us wish it so.&nbsp; However, I am not sure whether the same can be said of the medium and long term. Is there palpable optimism in the medium and long term?&nbsp; I think we do not know yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Look overseas for the land of gold?</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like very much the heading of the third pillar as the \"Land of Opportunity\".&nbsp; How many Singaporeans truly feel Singapore is or will become a land of opportunity?&nbsp; In a land of opportunity, our streets should be paved with gold.&nbsp; In typical Singlish, some may retort: \"Where got gold?\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays, we hear many Singapore businessmen saying that doing business and making money in Singapore is difficult.&nbsp; Not really, as some are still making money, but many truly find the going difficult.&nbsp; Several have resorted to going overseas to China, India and other parts of Southeast Asia to find their fortunes.&nbsp; It is very ironical.&nbsp; In the olden days, our forefathers came from China and India to seek their opportunities here.&nbsp; After over 100 years, the tide is reversed.&nbsp; Singaporeans are going to India and China to seek their fortunes.&nbsp; Things do move in cycles.&nbsp; There is an apt Chinese saying: <I>\"feng shui lun lui zhuan\".&nbsp;</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the changing of times, the diminishing reliance on clan associations, tontine funds and trade associations, and the move to rationalise the banks and <p align=left>Column: 569<p>finance houses, there are&nbsp;increasingly fewer avenues for the people in temporary need of funds to get help.&nbsp; Many went to loan sharks as a result.&nbsp; As graphically depicted in a scene in the movie \"Money No Enough\", one loan shark in the movie proudly proclaimed that he was providing a much-needed service to the community of providing loans to the poor, which our banks would not do.&nbsp; I would like the Government to consider seriously how more forms of financial help and related assistance can be given to the poor and unemployed to tide them over their temporary troubles so that they would not get into more troubles by borrowing from loan sharks and the like.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Honour the self-help groups and VWOs</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the self-help groups do more and reach out deeper into the community to target these desperately poor?&nbsp; I do not mean to lend them money like the loan sharks, but to give them aid in terms of food provisions, temporary job assistance, retraining, transport, schooling expenses, and such like.&nbsp; On this note, I truly wish to commend the NTUC Fairprice for recently giving out food vouchers to be distributed via the grassroots organisations to the poor and needy.&nbsp; We can encourage more to be done by social and community groups like the Lions Club, Rotary Club and other voluntary welfare organisations to step forward.&nbsp; Encourage more thrift and&nbsp;loan cooperatives to be formed to fill in the vacuum left by the banks and finance houses mergers.&nbsp; Those who give generous donations should&nbsp;be recognised, eg, VWOs and social volunteers as well as philanthropists may be considered for National Day Awards.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, it is time to review whether we should continue to assign the major and centralised fund-raising effort to Community Chest.&nbsp; This has a dilutive effect on the choice and target groups of each charity to source for its own <p align=left>Column: 570<p>donations.&nbsp; It also weakens the strength of each charitable body to go out and seek donations on its own.&nbsp; This is a matter that perhaps MCDS may wish to review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Pro-competition - help the small businesses</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Budget Speech, DPM Lee said that the primary stance of the Government in its economic policy is pro-competition.&nbsp; I would like to voice a view that this policy cannot be taken to the extreme.&nbsp; Singapore is a small country.&nbsp; Our market is very small to carry this policy of pro-competition in every arena.&nbsp; I would advocate a degree of flexibility.&nbsp; It is a fact that we have openly and unabashedly given long&nbsp;years of protection to the local banks.&nbsp; The constant crying for help by SMEs cannot be crying wolf all the time.&nbsp; At times, they are really in need of help, for example, in getting some preferential treatment in certain types of non-strategic and non-critical Government procurement contracts.&nbsp; It is practised in many countries, even in the USA.&nbsp; It is also time to recognise that GLCs do occupy some of the business space in Singapore and they compete against SMEs.&nbsp; The GLCs tend to leverage on their size and connections.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that this is a pro-business Government, which is done for national benefit.&nbsp; Nobody denies that.&nbsp; There has been some disappointment that this year's Budget is again too pro-MNCs and pro-large local companies.&nbsp; For example, the pioneer status for foreign investors is increased from 10 years to 15 years.&nbsp; When the Government does give something to small local companies like start-ups, it only gives parsimoniously and grudgingly.&nbsp; Let me demonstrate why.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Budget announced that local start-up companies are given a new tax relief of $100,000 of profits over the first three<p align=left>Column: 571<p> years of operation.&nbsp; This incentive is not of much help.&nbsp; Most new companies struggle to make money in the first few years.&nbsp; Those which can make profits in the first few years are in the minority.&nbsp; So, why offer an incentive that most local companies cannot enjoy?&nbsp; It is like dangling a plum in front of them to merely tease them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to suggest that the Government consider varying the scheme to allow for companies to enjoy the first $100,000 profit offset as from the point of the first year of profit of a new start-up, ie,&nbsp;first year of profit, not in the first three years alone.&nbsp; If we can be so generously giving 15 years of tax-free status to MNCs, why not a small gesture for these small new start-ups?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Help the individuals</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another complaint, Sir, is: why is the Government more generous to companies as against the individuals?&nbsp; The Government is favouring corporations versus individuals in the 2% income tax cut.&nbsp; The Government has said that it cannot fulfill its promised 2% cut to 20% target for both corporate and individuals at the same time due to budget constraints.&nbsp; If so, why not share the misery between corporations and individuals?&nbsp; Why not allow for a&nbsp;1% cut each in both the corporate and personal income taxes, rather than give all the 2% cut to corporations and then ask the individuals to wait for a few more years?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Towards a more open society</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to achieve the end of creating Singapore as a land of opportunity, it is very valid that we must have effective government and strong society.&nbsp; Effective government is easier to achieve, but strong society is much harder.&nbsp; The two routes to creating a strong society are either to create steadfastness and<p align=left>Column: 572<p> homogeneity, or flexibility and diversity.&nbsp; In the old world, I think steadfastness and homogeneity could work.&nbsp; But, in modern Singapore, where we have mass instant communication with the outside world, I firmly believe that flexibility and diversity are the right choice.&nbsp; I strongly feel that to create a strong society, we should encourage people to open up and speak up more freely.&nbsp; Any stone is worth turning over now and then for a re-look.&nbsp; There can be gems underneath.&nbsp; At the most, if it is not time yet, we can place the stone back gently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, we must allow the establishment of a more open society.&nbsp; There is a saying that great men think alike.&nbsp; In the new world, great men do not have to think alike.&nbsp; No one and no country has the monopoly to great ideas.&nbsp; In many instances, it is quite valid that \"the unreasonable man maketh the world\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am heartened that we are indeed moving towards this direction.&nbsp; Over the weekend, it was reported in the newspapers that the Acting Education Minister, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, wishes the Ministry of Education to focus on how to nurture original thinkers.&nbsp; He said:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"We will not succeed if we produce young Singaporeans who are too regular, or too much of the same mould ...&nbsp;&nbsp;We need Singaporeans with different talents and different ways of thinking ...&nbsp;willing to test new ideas and approaches with each other and with people from the world ...&nbsp;We have to nurture more Singaporeans who want to do something exceptional and stand out from the crowd.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully agree with Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam.&nbsp; Blessed would be the day when he could achieve his aim.&nbsp; Let us not summarily dismiss ideas.&nbsp; Let us have more open debates.&nbsp; Let us find what we can learn from others, or&nbsp;strike out on our own.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 573<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to conclude by quoting a Chinese saying by a famous Tang dynasty poet called Wang Le:&nbsp; <I>\"wu hua tian bao, ren jue ti ling\"</I>.&nbsp; It means to describe a fertile place where precious assets and talented minds can flourish.&nbsp; We hope that Singapore can be such a place, a land of opportunity, a fertile place of men of talents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, this is another occasion in Parliament that I have made a rather long speech.&nbsp;

I hope the delay shall not be too long.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the lowering of the corporate tax to 20%, whether it is sufficient incentive for those MNCs which are already here to remain here and to attract more new ones to come to our shores to do business, is another matter, because MNCs can now go elsewhere<p align=left>Column: 574<p> where land and operating costs are cheaper than those in Singapore.&nbsp;

I thought to myself: Singapore is supposed to be a first world country and people here still have to slog for 16 hours a day, seven days a week and 52 weeks a year, except probably for four days of respite during the Chinese New Year.&nbsp; I thought that only&nbsp;workers in the third world countries have to work that long hours to earn a living.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a start, I call on the Government, which is the biggest landlord in Singapore, to set an example by lowering rentals of their properties to a fair rent, especially to people who carry out food business in Singapore, hoping that other landowners can follow suit.&nbsp; High cost in doing business in Singapore has its problems.&nbsp; The Government says that foreign direct investments are still attracted to Singapore at about $9 billion a year,&nbsp;but only to open up mostly high-tech industries which are not labour-intensive. This means that they do not employ that many workers. Those workers who are unemployed shall not be very happy when they learn that fewer jobs shall be created. At the moment, the unemployment rate in Singapore remains at about 4.5% or about 800,000 workers. The Government looks to the service sector to mitigate the unemployment problem.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Budget Statement says that the Government is developing established services, such as trading and logistics, info-communications, technologies, financial services and tourism, while trying to expand emergent services such as education, healthcare and the creative <p align=left>Column: 575<p>sectors. As far as I can see, Singapore should have no problems expanding the education and the healthcare sectors. We have the infrastructure and the talent to make Singapore the education centre and the health hub of the region.&nbsp; We may have already become the education centre and the health hub of the region.&nbsp; Healthcare costs in Singapore are too high and we may lose out to other countries in the region who are quickly learning from Singapore to establish hospitals to compete with us.&nbsp; We, of course, must make sure that we do not lose out to them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for developing a vibrant creative sector in Singapore, I have not much confidence in that, after over 30 years of strict PAP rule, the majority of Singaporeans have become compliant, obedient and&nbsp;docile which are not conducive to establish the creative sector, in particular, the film industry. Hong Kong and America are more open and liberal societies than Singapore and they have successfully built&nbsp;a vibrant, successful film industry there which employs hundreds of workers and gives them lucrative returns. Singapore can also establish a successful film industry if we are willing to open our society and to be more liberal.&nbsp; I hope that I can see that day come about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall briefly mention the procreation policy.&nbsp; Last year, our TFR dropped to the lowest in the world, at 1.26.&nbsp; We had only 36,000 births and we require something like 50,000 babies to replace ourselves. The big question is what is to be done.&nbsp; Many suggestions had been forwarded and most probably are all valid. However, I would like to draw the Government's attention to the complaints of mothers with multiple births. Apparently, from the letters written to the local press recently, they have been unfairly discriminated against.&nbsp; I wish the <p align=left>Column: 576<p>Government&nbsp;could look seriously at their complaints and to try to put things right for them. I know they are only in the minority but the fact that the Government goes out of its way to help them, other mothers will take note that the Government is really sincere in helping mothers to have more babies and that will give mothers in Singapore more confidence. Who knows, the birth rate will climb in Singapore!&nbsp; I appeal to the Government to look into the complaints of mothers with multiple births to make sure that they are not discriminated against.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On foreign maids, the Government imposes a tax of $345 for each foreign maid employed in Singapore.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that the Government uses part of that large sum of money collected as levy to employ&nbsp;qualified psychiatrists to carry out compulsory psychiatric screening of each maid before she can start work in Singapore.&nbsp; This is to ensure that every maid who works in Singapore is psychologically sound. We have read of maids killing the child she is made to take care of, or even recently, a case was reported that a maid, together with another friend, also a maid, killed her own employer. Such murders are probably committed by maids who are not psychologically sound.&nbsp; Those mentally sick maids, when under stress in their jobs, can break down psychologically and can commit violent acts or even murders. Therefore, to prevent such crimes, the Government should use part of the levy collected to screen those maids&nbsp;who wish to work in Singapore and declare them sound before they can take up a job here.&nbsp; I think that would be money really worth spending.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</B> Mr&nbsp;Speaker, may I seek some clarifications from Mr Chiam?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam said that after&nbsp;30 years under the PAP, Singaporeans have become obedient, compliant and docile. <p align=left>Column: 577<p>Can I ask if he is also like that?&nbsp; Is he experiencing that himself?&nbsp; Otherwise, how can he make such a sweeping statement?</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B> I should&nbsp;say&nbsp;the majority of Singaporeans, not every Singaporean.</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</B> But does that mean he is not obedient, compliant and docile as the majority of Singaporeans?&nbsp; I just want to clarify his position on this.</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong:</B> Sir, the&nbsp;learned hon.

First of all, I would like to say that I had&nbsp;very low expectations of the types of initiatives the Finance Minister would be announcing in this Budget, given that the economy is at the recovery stage. Against these lower expectations, I am, in fact, pleased with the range of initiatives the Finance Minister announced this year, particularly <p align=left>Column: 578<p>in the area of entrepreneurship support.&nbsp; I now feel very comfortable that the Government is well on its way&nbsp;to making entrepreneurship an important agenda of our economic development.&nbsp; Of course, the first signal of&nbsp;its seriousness was the appointment of the Minister in charge of Entrepreneurship, Mr Raymond Lim, and with&nbsp;its support of the many initiatives recommended to promote entrepreneurship, it gives many of us, who have been advocates of an entrepreneurial economy, confidence that we finally have the 'ears' of the Government, which, up to recently, looked like a half-hearted support.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the initiatives which the Finance Minister announced, like the Entrepreneurship Investment Incentive, the tax changes to support asset securitisation and the tax benefits for start-ups were all moves in the right direction.&nbsp; Before I go on, Sir, I would like to say that recently, I was asked by a journalist as to what I will be bringing up during the Budget debate.&nbsp; I mentioned to him the issues that I would be raising and he told me that it was actually a waste of time and it was pointless,&nbsp;as the Government did not seem to listen.&nbsp; I would like to state here that I disagree with this observation as I have, over the years, seen significant improvements put in place as a result of the suggestions made by many of us in this House and by other advocates of changes from the private sector and from organisations like the Action Committee for Entrepreneurs (ACE).&nbsp; I am very happy to see the three initiatives supporting entrepreneurship&nbsp;I mentioned. These have been the recommendations that have been made by many of us and they are finally being implemented.&nbsp; Of course, they were not implemented the day we asked for&nbsp;them but, over time,&nbsp;they happen. I would like to say, like any entrepreneur, never give up. We will continuously bring up those issues.&nbsp; We will be spontaneous, as Mr Chiam wants us to be, and while we are<p align=left>Column: 579<p> obedient, we will still come up with suggestions for changes.&nbsp; This is one thing that really needs to happen, that is, a Government to listen a lot more because, as the results have shown, over time, what many of us said has turned out to be something that should have been done and, if the Government could implement this faster, we would have a more interesting economic development ahead of us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the one area that the Finance Minister glaringly missed out this year was&nbsp;in the&nbsp;area of helping local companies, not start-ups, but those SMEs who are already in business here.&nbsp;Instead of helping these companies, in fact, we added costs, with the increase&nbsp;in the ceiling for the SDF and the increase&nbsp;in the skilled workers' levy.&nbsp; The private sector, particularly the SMEs, felt left out this time - that we did not address cost reduction issues. These are the few things that I would like to bring up this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, the area of cost reduction and business costs.&nbsp; As I mentioned, this was really missing this year.&nbsp; We have been hearing statements from the Government that the cost reduction efforts and the cost issues continue to plague the Singapore economy.&nbsp; The only one thing that has been addressed in this respect is the area of wage restructuring</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>which is important&nbsp;to make Singapore companies competitive.&nbsp; But the question is what is the root cause of these high wages in the first place?&nbsp; Many of us have raised this many times, ie,&nbsp;the cost of living continues to be high, that every Singaporean here needs to have wages high enough to support even their basic lifestyle.&nbsp; What is more, Singaporeans at this stage should expect better than the basic lifestyle, but the costs are just too high.&nbsp; So, if we want to restructure wages, we must also restructure the cost of living in Singapore.&nbsp; For companies to <p align=left>Column: 580<p>remain competitive, there needs to be a restructuring of cost for businesses too.&nbsp; So, may I ask the Finance Minister: what has happened to the cost reduction effort?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was afraid that at the first sign of a recovering economy the Government will forget about the need to do more about restructuring and reducing costs.&nbsp; While there is a realisation by the Government, and my impression is that we have run out of ideas about what needs to be done,&nbsp;I think this could be quite detrimental to the economy.&nbsp; I know of my local companies which still suffer from cost competitiveness as compared to their competitors around the world, particularly from around the region, and they risk going out of business.&nbsp; Also, there are still a number of multinationals based here in Singapore who will not slow down their plans to relocate out of Singapore as they still do not see long-term cost reduction actions.&nbsp; I have brought this up many times before about the Government's approach of temporary rebates and subsidies, which will result in the cost going up again once the Government decides that times are good again.&nbsp; We, therefore, seriously need to look at long-term cost reduction and assurances from the Government that costs will go down or will remain low.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to remind the Finance Minister about the seriousness of this issue and it was also raised by none other than the Senior Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who at one of his speeches published in the <I>Business Times</I> on 31st January 2004, headlined \"Cost too high in Singapore\".&nbsp; The report&nbsp;quoted the Senior Minister as saying, \"While the economy may be bouncing back, Singapore still has a long-term problem of high cost structure to deal with.\"&nbsp; In his speech, he said, \"Wages, rents, fees, taxes, have become too high compared to not only China and India, but also to our immediate neighbours.&nbsp; Singapore requires basic<p align=left>Column: 581<p> changes in cost structures and, unless this happens, many industries here will relocate to China and elsewhere.\"&nbsp; So, again, I ask the Government not to relax too soon at the first sign of the economy recovering.&nbsp; We need to seriously address these issues and to take this opportunity of good times to go about seriously addressing and reducing costs further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what are the areas that we should look for? These have been brought up many times before and I would repeat them here.&nbsp; First of all, permanent rental reductions, as well as lowering industrial and commercial property prices, to be benchmarked not against the commercial value of, say, Raffles City property, as what we have heard Mr Ngiam Tong Dow recently talked about the benchmarking approach that we have taken.&nbsp; I think we should be benchmarking against the prices of properties in our competitor countries.&nbsp; On utilities,&nbsp;while the energy market is being relaxed and it is coming down, I think it is not the most competitive in the area of power supply and also in other utilities.&nbsp; So&nbsp;we need to address these as we move forward.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many other costs like hidden taxes&nbsp;- as I have mentioned before, the many taxes that we have, higher port and aviation charges - in fact, have seen us losing our business from Singapore to our neighbouring ports because of this issue.&nbsp; The bottom-line is that the Government has&nbsp;yet to do a good job in addressing the cost competitiveness issues other than the good job it has done in the area of wage reduction, which is, of course, at the expense of harder times for Singaporeans if the rest of the cost issues are not addressed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second area which is related to cost is one of cost of Government.&nbsp; This is an area that surprised me that we seem to be operating in a \"Fantasyland\" where it continues to operate as if the economy is growing at a 10% rate.&nbsp; We have seen, <p align=left>Column: 582<p>since 1997, that this can no longer remain the case.&nbsp; Why do I say \"fantasy\"?&nbsp; While I mentioned the part on the cost of business problem and in the area of high charges and rates which the Government charges to businesses, I understand the principle of cost recovery, which is good, since this principle assumes that the Government would not make a profit when charging the people and the companies, and with the hope to keep such costs low.&nbsp; But, if the cost of providing these services is high in the first place, then there is little hope for us in reducing costs to the users.&nbsp; In this respect, I feel that the Government has not done enough to reduce its own costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was encouraged by the Finance Minister's comments that the Cut Waste Panel has made progress, and about the efforts to limit the budgets of the various Ministries, I am not convinced enough has been done to reduce the cost of running the Government.&nbsp; This was the hunch that I had because I have yet to see the cost coming down in these areas.&nbsp; I went back to the past&nbsp;five years of the Budget books and I looked at the details.&nbsp; To my surprise, the data shows that the cost of running the Government had continuously increased since 1999.&nbsp; If we look at only the running cost items, not counting the development expenditures, which are&nbsp;capital and long-term investments in nature, the line items called \"running cost\" had continued to rise from $13.59 billion in 1999 to $17.05 billion&nbsp;in 2002.&nbsp; Then it is estimated to be at $17.35 billion in 2003 and planned to be $18.05 billion in 2004.&nbsp; Now, if we take out the military spending, which is strategic in nature, then the numbers under the operating expenditure section of the Budget book looks like this:&nbsp;all non-military expenditure in 1999 was $1.89 billion, and this continues to go up, with the $2.38 billion expected in 2004.&nbsp; And, if I look at the manpower cost part of the Budget book, in 1999 the cost was $2.87 billion and this continues to go up<p align=left>Column: 583<p> to a planned&nbsp; $3.47 billion in 2004.&nbsp; In fact, if my analysis is not wrong, then the 2004 cost of running the Government would be the highest in our recent history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These numbers surprised me, as I said, and therefore I think that we really need to get out of this fantasy world, because the whole world has changed around us in the last&nbsp;five years, particularly after the Asian financial crisis.&nbsp; I have been involved in a number of companies and have been looking at what was happening around in the private sector.&nbsp; In the real world, particularly in the private sector, they have restructured themselves and many companies have to do drastic cost reduction just to survive.&nbsp; We have seen many companies in the private sector reducing cost by as much as 20-30% over the last&nbsp;two years.&nbsp; In contrast, we are seeing the cost of Government continuing to go up and, therefore, there is little wonder that we continue to see business cost not coming down.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we did well in wage reductions, who contributed to this?&nbsp; They were the people of Singapore.&nbsp; The companies have played their part too, and I feel it is now time for the Government to play its part seriously.&nbsp; I think there is an urgent need for the Government to put in place cost reduction targets for the sake of boosting our economy.&nbsp; Unless clear targets are set, like what the Senior Minister suggested, as a 20% cost reduction target for Singapore Airlines, that was what he said, I do not think any serious cost reduction would take place in the Government.&nbsp; The Cut Waste Panel would have limited success because it just looks at wastes.&nbsp; What the Government really needs to look at&nbsp;are real structural changes, which may not be obvious as wastes, but which can be structural changes and which can be re-engineered to achieve big improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 584<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of cost, the Government needs to play its part too.&nbsp; It should learn how the private sector got more productive and more efficient.&nbsp; The companies which restructured their costs survive and they became stronger.&nbsp; We need, therefore, the Government to be also productive and efficient and to become stronger.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one thing related to the issue of cost of Government is the issue of budget deficit which we have been talking about.&nbsp; First of all, the budget deficits of the past years were really a result of specific transfers which the Government made for various reasons.&nbsp; And, some of them were very good reasons.&nbsp; At the operating level, we have not really seen a budget deficit.&nbsp; The real deficit was really in the year 2003, where, before transfers, the deficit was about $1.16 billion.&nbsp; In fact, at the operating level in 2004, we would still not see a deficit budget.&nbsp; In fact, there is a surplus of $0.16 billion.&nbsp; In any case, my real point is that there are two ways to balance a budget.&nbsp; The first, of course, is to bring in more revenue, which is in a way not controllable.&nbsp; While we have fixed taxes, companies may not make profits, individuals may not make income to pay taxes. But, the second way is to reduce costs.&nbsp; So, if the Government can really work harder in reducing cost, I am sure we will have a surplus budget.&nbsp; I think this again needs to be addressed quite seriously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third area is one of the Government's interference and dominant role in GLCs and TLCs.&nbsp; I feel that the Government should shed its \"I know best\" attitude when it comes to the management of these companies.&nbsp; Many a time, many Singaporeans have given feedback to the Government, the latest being the recommendations by the ERC, where the recommendations are for the Government&nbsp;not to interfere and be involved in business.&nbsp; While there was seemingly good reception by the <p align=left>Column: 585<p>Government, the outcome does not show it has, and will let go.&nbsp; While many of them are already listed companies, we continue to see a strong influence of the Government, including giving helping hands to some of these companies, hence creating an unlevel playing field in the perception of others and, I think, this is to the&nbsp;detriment of the private sector.&nbsp; Of course, it took the USA, through its FTA, to pressure the Government to back off from playing a dominant role in the Government-owned companies, I feel that the Government could have reacted earlier, but I guess we have to thank the US FTA for this, that the level playing field may be created very soon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, two examples which stand as cases where the Government is being directly involved in the affairs of the Government-owned companies are SIA and PSA.&nbsp; In both cases, we see very senior Ministers getting directly involved, despite the fact that both of them supposedly have strong management teams and boards running them.&nbsp; This is not a good signal and is not in line with what the Government has been saying about its role in managing its Government-owned companies through its investment arms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example I can remember is the proposed merger of our transport companies.&nbsp; In that case, again, the Government, through a Minister, jumped the gun to go public with his suggestion that the companies should merge into one entity.&nbsp; Both companies are listed and it should have been their own decision.&nbsp; Of course, the Government could advise these companies, but this could have been done, not publicly, I believe.&nbsp; They could have a private discussion, rather than to come out in the open.&nbsp; Sir, my point is that the signals that we are giving are not good, not just to private companies in Singapore but also to other countries, about the dominant role that the Government is playing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 586<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, I feel that the Government continues to have a dominant role in financing companies.&nbsp; Currently, I feel that there is too much money in the hands of too few people, particularly held by the Government funds and Government economic agencies.&nbsp; We all know that money talks and, therefore, by giving money to a few people to manage, we created a lopsided outcome as to how and where the money gets invested.&nbsp; This is particularly so because of the type of people who are appointed to the agencies managing the money.&nbsp; They mainly come from the same background, being Government-appointed.&nbsp; I suggest that the Government change its approach by spreading the money around and by giving it to more agencies, both Government agencies as well as non-Government agencies.&nbsp; I have seen a number of Government agencies which were so limited in funds that they are not able to do what they really want to do effectively,&nbsp; whilst some other agencies have lots of money and, therefore, they continue to support one cross-section of industry that we should be supporting.&nbsp; We could learn from the USA model where the Government deploys some of its funds to organisations like the Small Business Investment Corporations (SBICs), or we could deploy some of our funds to be managed by some successful Singapore businessmen for investment in private companies, whether start-ups or established companies.&nbsp; I am sure that the overall return will be more interesting than what the Government has been able to derive from its current investment arms.&nbsp; This would then go a long way in resolving the financing problems of our local entreprenuers and companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, having said the above, I would nonetheless thank the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for giving his support to the entrepreneurship drive in Singapore by announcing the few initiatives in this year's Budget.&nbsp; What is not so obvious is<p align=left>Column: 587<p> that the Government has been very receptive to a series of recommendations made by private sector groups, and I have been involved in some of them.&nbsp; We have recommended a number of initiatives which we hope would make Singapore&nbsp;a very&nbsp;vibrant place for entrepreneurship and for financing entrepreneurs and start-ups, and also for financing of local companies.&nbsp; The Government has agreed to many of the recommendations.&nbsp; And now, the&nbsp;action crucible for financing, which is subgrouped under ACE&nbsp;that I am heading, is working to implement as many of the recommendations as possible and I am glad to note that the Government is very receptive and I hope it continues to do so, because I believe if it can implement these things we will really have a change of landscape in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I had a wish-list which I presented during the 2002 Budget debate.&nbsp; I still stand by those items but I do not want to spend time talking about them down here.&nbsp; Most of those items were related to cost reductions and I hope that the Government could seriously get back on track and walk the talk in really addressing the cost issues in Singapore so that we could attract and retain long-term companies and investors into Singapore, thereby creating more jobs for our fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp; The economy is recovering and optimism is in the air, but we all need to realise that while we would see good times again, sooner or later, we would again face tough times as the economic cycles shorten.&nbsp; If we start resting on our laurels and fail to address these issues I highlighted, the next time it may be too&nbsp;late for us.&nbsp; So I hope that the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister would seriously look at the recommendations that I have made, particularly&nbsp;in the area of cost reduction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the motion.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><p align=left>Column: 588<p><!--MP_NAME:Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</B> Sir, let me begin by expressing my support for the strategic initiatives outlined by the Deputy Prime Minister in the Budget Statement.&nbsp; I would like to devote my speech to what I see as the challenges of translating two of these initiatives into concrete results, the first of which is the ramifications of the budget cut, virtually Government-wide, and secondly, the key considerations when drawing up the procreation initiatives.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the austerity drive.&nbsp; Sir, the move to cut the budgets of Government Ministries by 2% for each of the next&nbsp;two years is commendable and reflects a very responsive approach to changing circumstances.&nbsp; As elaborated by my colleague, Mr Leong, however, the key question is really how the Ministries would achieve these cuts.&nbsp; Would it arise from a careful review of recurrent practices, or of new projects and not from the scrapping of social programmes, or the passing on of its own expenditure to the private sector?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me, Sir, to illustrate with an anecdotal possibility.&nbsp; Supposing trees in the divider of an expressway are trimmed once every&nbsp;two weeks, to save cost, the tender is now modified for a trim once every&nbsp;four weeks, presumably at the same absolute charges.&nbsp; There are now two likely consequences.&nbsp; Firstly, I am told that trees do not stop growing from the&nbsp;third week of trimming.&nbsp; So overgrown trees can create unnecessary road hazards.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>Secondly, I am also told that the amount of trimming effort needed varies directly with frequency.&nbsp; So, effectively, contractors will be squeezed if they have to make do with the old rates. The contracts handed out by most Government departments are usually so material that suppliers cannot afford to ignore them. Their bargaining position is poor. Hence, what is likely to happen is, effectively, the passing on of the cuts to the private sector.<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 589<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to humbly suggest that a lot of cost savings could perhaps be realised through better coordination between Government departments. Let me recount a live example within my constituency. As part of a private estate upgrading programme&nbsp;(EUP), which my residents are extremely grateful for, the old drains were replaced and covered. A walkway is then built over the covered drains. In the very old area of <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Serangoon</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Gardens</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, some roads are extremely narrow.&nbsp; So, for years, residents have parked on grass verges. As such, after the drainage improvements, these narrower roads cannot have regular kerbs.&nbsp; My grassroots leaders had conveyed to the relevant departments their experience&nbsp;that regular kerbs would not work for other similar stretches for the rest of the estate. They were told that improvement works were not imminent. So, it came as a real surprise when not only were improvement works carried out on these stretches, but regular kerbs were also constructed. The residents, of course,&nbsp;cried foul as they could no longer park outside their homes on these stretches and, regrettably,&nbsp;the kerbs would now have to go! If there were better coordination, much time and money would not have been wasted.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this end, can the Deputy Prime Minister&nbsp;reassure the House that the burden of the budget cuts would not manifest itself as either&nbsp;&nbsp; sub-standard service or&nbsp;&nbsp; mindless efficiency that targets the more dispensable social programmes or&nbsp;an indirect outsourcing of not services but&nbsp;costs to the private sector?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the Deputy Prime Minister also assure the House that each Ministry will not take the easy way out but will scrutinise its \"must-have\" programmes, as I believe the 2-plus-2% cut must really presume to be permanent.&nbsp; Will he also&nbsp;ensure that Ministries&nbsp;adopt a proactive attitude towards structural reforms in the way they do their business and towards cutting waste instead of leaving the Cut <p align=left>Column: 590<p>Waste Panel to handle suggestions or complaints in a reactive fashion?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately, the budget cuts should be achieved without a deterioration in performance and service standards.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Next, on&nbsp;&nbsp;procreation initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I dwell on the various aspects and make specific recommendations, I would like to place strong emphasis on the need for Government to be consistent in all its messaging and signalling. I recommend that the Government bear the following in mind when mapping the overall strategy:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, do not just blame the women.&nbsp;&nbsp; The procreation challenge is not a women's issue or problem; the notion of shared responsibility for childbearing between the husband and wife must prevail. It is not helpful that many of the current liabilities revolve around women being expected to carry the burden, literally, economically and socially.&nbsp; By the same token, I look forward to active participation in this debate by my male parliamentary colleagues.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, do not blame their career aspirations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Women do not set out not wanting to get married or to stay childless after having gotten married. Neither are women so career-minded that childbearing takes a permanent back seat. Many simply want to be responsible and good mothers. But they have to make real trade-offs, as they would like to remain economically engaged as well. So, if there are too many hindrances and very little moral support, not having a child becomes the default option.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, do not prescribe what is ideal.&nbsp;&nbsp; A pro-family message must necessarily be pro-children, regardless of the number of children. It used to be \"Stop at 2\" and then \"Have 3 or more, if you can afford it\". The decision on the number of children is a rather personal one and many couples are increasingly uncomfortable<p align=left>Column: 591<p> with the Government's prescriptive approach. Until recently, couples with three or more children unwittingly get stigmatised as they struggle to get leave following childbirth or have to explain to their own child why there is no Edusave balance. Even worse still are multiple births, where entitlements get reined in for subsequent children. If ever there was a reason to be liberal in interpretation, then surely celebrating multiple births amidst a declining replacement rate must be one.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead, I would like to recommend that the Government undertake three broad initiatives:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, change mindsets.&nbsp; Launch extensive public education on a long-term basis&nbsp;to highlight the value of children to a marriage,&nbsp;to glamourise motherhood; mothers should not be viewed as economic nuisances, just as men are not viewed unfavourably for their reservist obligations, and&nbsp; to emphasise shared responsibility between husbands and wives in childbearing and child rearing.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, provide the necessary support systems:&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow for longer maternity leave of up to six&nbsp;months on a voluntary basis, with Government picking up the tab beyond the existing, mandatory eight&nbsp;weeks (and not two months, if I may respectfully correct the Deputy Prime Minister).&nbsp;&nbsp;Every extra week is precious to a working mother who is on maternity leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government may want to pay in full up to the end of the fourth&nbsp; month and support at half-pay for the remaining two months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Facilitate the setting up of more affordable infant care services through subsidies.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 592<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Allow for a&nbsp; declining maid levy so that employers can retain good help over a longer period of time without having to bear higher employment costs.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Extend tax benefits to husbands so that women are not compelled to return to work just to 'enjoy' the benefit.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure a minimum level of ante- and post-natal care, as well as of pediatric care so that childbearing and rearing can have a pleasant start.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide support for young couples who may need help to conceive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third initiative revolves around Government setting an example.&nbsp;&nbsp; Being the largest employer, the Government should take the lead by walking-the-talk and implement family-friendly policies, such as longer maternity leave, introduction of paternity leave, in the hope that the private sector may do likewise eventually; provision of childcare facilities and developing more flexible work arrangements across more Ministries. These should include working from home and job-sharing, especially to facilitate the re-entry of mothers into the public sector.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, ultimately, the ideal scenario is one where a couple can choose how they would want to care for their child and are not unduly limited by mindsets about stereotype roles for the mother, or by inflexible work arrangements, or unfriendly corporate policies, or limited and expensive infant care. It must also be one where the woman is not placed at a disadvantage when it comes to employment. In short, the overarching principle is one of no gender discrimination in employment on account of family formation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; One final point, the procreation challenges require a multi-pronged approach because the considerations are <p align=left>Column: 593<p>varied and often emotive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, it would appear that the Government committee charged with this heavy responsibility is under-represented by women.&nbsp; How would the many men know what women really want?&nbsp; With all due respect to the Minister and his committee, would we end up with stereotyped solutions that leave us scratching our heads, again?&nbsp; I propose that the Deputy Prime Minister review the composition of this committee and enlist the help of many more women, including the women MPs in this House, who will be more than willing to help address a national challenge.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note Sir, I thank the DPM in anticipation of a holistic approach to addressing the procreation challenges.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</B> Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Budget statements these past few years have focused on tackling the economic challenges, easing the pain of transition and setting the stage of sustained growth&nbsp;for the future.&nbsp; With the economy now on the mend, let us press on with these efforts and not slacken in our efforts to transform our economy and systems and to invest heavily in skills upgrading and employability of our workers.&nbsp; Only then would we prepare and position ourselves well in an uncertain future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's Budget Statement appropriately addresses another key fundamental, which is that while we seek to create a bright future, we also need to make sure that there will be enough Singaporeans to inherit and populate that future.&nbsp; Last year, only 37,000 Singaporean babies were born.&nbsp; The overall birth rate was only 1.37, much lower than the replacement rate of 2.1.&nbsp; If this goes on unchecked, then we will eventually disappear from the face of the earth.&nbsp; But even before we truly decimate ourselves, I <p align=left>Column: 594<p>think there are other serious implications that will befall our society and which we will have to face.&nbsp; For example, with fewer babies born each year, will there be enough Singaporeans to defend our country, notwithstanding our aggressive use of technology in the SAF?&nbsp; And with fewer babies born each year, will there be enough skilled workers to attract investments and anchor jobs here?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the birth rate drops with time, then the rate of population aging will increase.&nbsp; At present, some 7% or 8% of our population is above the age of 65.&nbsp; We project that it will become around 20% by the year 2030.&nbsp; If the birth rate keeps dropping, then our society will become elderly-heavy even faster.&nbsp; Then how will we support and take care of the elderly?&nbsp; Who will pay for the taxes or foot the bill for such care?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are not idle questions for some distant generation to answer.&nbsp; Many of us might still be around in 2020 or even 2030.&nbsp; It is therefore in our own best interests that we begin to turn the tide now sooner rather than later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>More babies</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most direct approach is, of course, to encourage Singaporeans to have more babies.&nbsp; I say it is direct, but it is not simple.&nbsp; From the feedback I got from union leaders, grassroots leaders and&nbsp;some of the ideas being talked about, such as longer maternity leave for mothers, higher subsidies for infant care and childcare, flexible family-friendly work arrangements, should all be helpful.&nbsp; By enabling more time for the mother to bond with the child and by lowering the cost of care for the household, it will lower barriers to child-bearing and rearing.&nbsp; So, the direction is the right one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question is over cost-effectiveness and who should bear which part of the cost.&nbsp; Clearly, employees<p align=left>Column: 595<p> would want any additional maternity leave to be paid leave.&nbsp; They would also like to see significant increases in infant care subsidies so that the net cash outlay on their part is roughly similar to the current net cash outlay for childcare and the gap can be substantially narrowed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equally clearly, employers will see any such move as imposing an additional cost and operational burden, because they see it as having to cope with an employee's longer absence as well as having to employ a substitute in the meantime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the perspective of Singaporean couples who have children, they would want to avail themselves fully of any new initiative.&nbsp; From the Government's standpoint, initiatives should be targeted at encouraging increase over the \"natural\" outcome&nbsp; -&nbsp; net increases&nbsp; -&nbsp; rather than huge deadweight costs.&nbsp; There is no simple solution.&nbsp; If it were so simple, it would have been solved already.&nbsp; And these are delicate balances to strike, and I can appreciate that.&nbsp; If a workable compromise can be achieved, then we can, hopefully, stem the decline of our birth rate.&nbsp; But at the same time, if the balance is struck wrongly, it could be a huge waste of money and it could have adverse effects on business and employment.&nbsp; I therefore do not envy the job of the Minister in this regard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In considering the various measures, I do urge the Government to give priority to items</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>that are within its more direct control, such as infant care and childcare subsidies.&nbsp; In the so many measures that are being talked about, not every one of them is easy to get a settlement on.&nbsp; But those that we can make an earlier decision, I think we should. &nbsp;And therefore in this way, there is no need to hold up all things just because some things cannot be resolved readily.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 596<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, I urge employers to take a longer term view to these efforts.&nbsp; To the extent that the efforts succeed, you would have better assurance of a larger pool of workers in the future.&nbsp; Hence, you can look upon this exercise as one of investing in your company's own future labour supply, rather than just an immediate increase in cost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To my fellow Singaporeans, I appeal to you to also look beyond the immediate to your own longer term needs.&nbsp; While it is good to be able to enjoy better subsidies and incentives, we must also remember that we are ultimately the ones who decide the kind of life and family environment we live in now and in the future, and we ourselves must be responsible for the consequences of our own choices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Reducing infant mortality further?</i></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also look at different ways in which we can increase the net supply of babies.&nbsp; I look at the infant mortality rate.&nbsp; In 1960, it was 34.8 per thousand births.&nbsp; Over the decades, reflecting improved economic circumstances and healthcare, that has been greatly brought down.&nbsp; According to MOH statistics, it is now below three per 1,000 births, and it is amongst the lowest in the world and it is on par with the most advanced countries.&nbsp; So, infant mortality rate reduction will not yield us many more births in this regard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Fewer abortions?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there is another area that we should examine, and that is abortion.&nbsp; According to the Ministry of Health's Annual Report 2001, total abortions in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> totalled around 13,800 each year from 1997 to 2000.&nbsp; I do not have the figures beyond the 2001 report.&nbsp; But assuming that they have been around the same these past few years, then it is a large loss of&nbsp; births in relation to total births of only 37,000 last year.&nbsp; For every<p align=left>Column: 597<p> three babies born, one other baby is aborted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I recognise that abortions are done for many different reasons, ranging from medical, social to economic.&nbsp; But, perhaps, not every abortion is unavoidable.&nbsp; By examining the factors behind the abortions in even greater detail than we have done so far, we might yet be able to bring down that number.&nbsp; And if we can reduce these abortions by a third, or maybe even a fifth, it would make a significant difference.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>More adoptions?</i></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And even as some Singaporeans abort their pregnancies, there are others who are not able to conceive and who would want to adopt children.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a <i>Sunday Times'</i> article on 7th March, it says and I quote, \"There is no ballpark figure of how many people are in the queue at adoption agencies.&nbsp; But in the last four years, Singaporeans have adopted an average of 700 children a year.&nbsp; In this regard, we can study how adoption processes can be adjusted or reconfigured to facilitate adoption and matching, especially amongst Singaporeans.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the many childless couples who have sought to adopt children from outside Singapore, I also note from media reports that in respect of adoptions from China, two voluntary welfare organisations have been appointed to manage the processes and pilot new processes, and I hope that this pilot will provide useful learning points on how these processes can be made both more responsive and robust at the same time.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>The sandwiched class</i></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we home in on the measures directed at births, we must also recognise that couples make decisions about <p align=left>Column: 598<p>childbearing, taking into account&nbsp;a wide variety of factors.&nbsp; One of those factors is the pressure felt by the sandwiched class - people who have to support both their parents' generation and also their children.&nbsp; This pressure has physical, financial and emotional dimensions.&nbsp; It is accentuated by a low birth rate, because each succeeding generation has fewer working adults to support a larger number of elderly, while concurrently having to face the rising cost and stress of bringing up the next generation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Younger couples may therefore ask themselves whether there will be enough money, and enough people, to responsibly support such care to the generation before them and the generation after them.&nbsp; In the overall calculations, there will be trade-offs.&nbsp; Nuclear families make these questions even more pertinent because there is a loss of inter-generational bonding, mutual help and economies of scale that the larger family group can supply.&nbsp; So there is a double whammy with growing needs for both childcare and eldercare.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point here is that we will have to further step up our actions with regard to enhancing the employability of older workers and addressing eldercare needs, as part of our total efforts to get better results at the birth end.&nbsp; And by providing concrete ways forward on the issue of enhancing the employability of older workers, eldercare and fostering intergenerational bonding and mutual support, we will help lower the overall pressure on the middle generation, and that might further increase the chances of their having more children.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Top-up through immigration</i></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, notwithstanding actions to increase and save births, I believe that it would still be a very uphill task to achieve replacement rate in the immediate future.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 599<p>For this reason, I think it would be necessary for Government to consider additional ways to increase immigration.&nbsp; Of course, we are not interested in just bringing in the numbers.&nbsp; All along, the policy of the Government has been to be careful and selective about granting permanent residency and citizenship, allowing only for those who can and will add value to our society, and also being very clear that if you are not desirable, then we do not want you here.&nbsp; I support such a prudent stance.&nbsp; However, we should examine further to see if there are ways of integrating our processes more closely to induce more potentially eligible foreigners, such as those who study and work here, to take up permanent residency.&nbsp; As <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s drive to becoming an education hub takes shape, there should be more opportunities for us to do this.&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, for example, is able to benefit by augmenting its talent pool through tapping on its large body of foreign students.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The road from permanent residency to citizenship will certainly not be a straightforward one.&nbsp; We should review holistically the slate of benefits accruing to citizens versus permanent residents, and ensure that there is a significant difference. This is to give a stronger incentive to eligible permanent residents to seek our citizenship at an earlier rather than&nbsp;later time.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Anchoring Singaporeans</i></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as we must try all means to minimise the attrition on births and induct valuable immigrants, we must continue to do our utmost to retain the hearts of Singaporeans in their country and its future, wherever they may work.&nbsp; Indeed, the Prime Minister spent a good part of this National Day rally speech last year driving home this point.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 600<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being pragmatic, I think, is as in-born a Singaporean trait as you can find one.&nbsp; So I believe that in the overall scheme of things, it ultimately boils down to how we make this place a land of opportunity where talent and effort unite to make hopes and dreams come true, and this is the very subject of this and previous Budgets.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Let us move ahead</i></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:place><st1:City>Sir</st1:City>, <st1:country-region>Singapore</st1:country-region></st1:place> has overcome many obstacles in our journey from third world to the first.&nbsp; At every turn of the road, we encountered new challenges and tough choices.&nbsp; Each time, we tackled the problems head-on with sound logic, always planning ahead, placing the long-term interests of our people first and adapting with the times.&nbsp; That was how we forged ahead and succeeded.&nbsp; We must now move with equal resolve and speed to tackle the twin challenges of low birth rates and a rapidly aging population, and thereby secure a better future for Singaporeans.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the motion.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Jurong)</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I> :&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister.&nbsp; This Budget actually lays down the long-term policy of the Government and DPM Lee's personal political ideal.&nbsp; &nbsp; DPM Lee mentioned three main pillars to support the future prosperity of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Because of time constraint, I will only speak on how to build up a strong society, and on how to cultivate our next generation, ie, the \"baby challenge\".&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior Minister Lee and Prime Minister Goh have already mentioned this before. Now, DPM Lee brings up this subject again in his Budget Statement and he is treating this issue as a sort of national crisis. Our total fertility rate now is 1.26, the lowest ever!&nbsp; He stated that,if <p align=left>Column: 601<p> Singaporeans are not producing enough babies to build and protect our nation, we will face serious problems in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since this subject was brought up by DPM Lee, many people have debated over it. &nbsp; Some are optimistic; some are pessimistic. &nbsp; But I personally feel that, as a nation, we should look at this matter with more confidence and optimism as we face this very tough challenge.&nbsp; I think the simplest way is, of course, to import talents from other countries.&nbsp; This can well be an immediate solution to this matter.&nbsp; We welcome new immigrants to join in the process of our nation building.&nbsp; But I fully support the Deputy Prime Minister's appeal to Singaporeans to produce more babies ourselves.&nbsp; I look at this as a mission or a cause.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall look at it in two ways, ie, a tangible one and an intangible one.&nbsp; The tangible one is that we should look at it as a societal movement.&nbsp; It should not be just &nbsp; the Government's effort, but a societal movement. With globalisation and the highly competitive economic environment, how to reduce costs, improve productivity and add value to everybody's work is of paramount importance.&nbsp; I think we should create such a conducive environment, then this problem can be solved. &nbsp; I do not want to spend too much time on analysing the various factors, because much has been said and many views have been expressed in the newspapers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, Deputy Speaker Mrs Lim Hwee Hua said that we should not blame the women alone for the low fertility rate.&nbsp; This is not just the women's responsibility.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of everybody, every family, and &nbsp; the whole society.&nbsp; So, we should look at it as a societal movement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, change our mindset.&nbsp; If you have time, you should view the Discovery <p align=left>Column: 602<p>Channel on TV. From the documentaries on the animal kingdom, you will discover that, in order to survive, the animals have to compete against one another.&nbsp; Sometimes, they even have to attack their competitors in order to mate with the females and produce offsprings. The salmons have to swim against the current to lay eggs at the upstreams of rivers and sacrifice their lives in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For our Singaporeans, there is a very urgent call to produce more babies, so that we can have people to succeed us.&nbsp; As the ancient sage Mencius has said, \"Of the three forms of unfiliality, the worst is to have no descendants.\"&nbsp; So, if you have no children, you are considered a very unfilial son.&nbsp; Of course, some people may say this is old-fashioned thinking. But I think giving birth to children and to have people to succeed us is one of the most important objectives in our lives.&nbsp; How are we going to, once again, call upon all the people of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> to keep this very important message of human survival in mind?&nbsp; Members have called upon the schools to spread this message to our young Singaporeans. Yes, we want to survive, we want &nbsp; better skills, we want to learn how to earn a living.&nbsp; However, in the schools today, the emphases are on studies and school work. Can we revamp our curricula to include subjects, such as how we deal with people, how to start &nbsp; a family and how to plan for our future generations?&nbsp; For the girls, we could strive to cultivate not just good career women, but also good mothers. &nbsp;For the boys, we have to&nbsp;cultivate good workers and also good fathers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the Government and the people should have this consensus.&nbsp; This&nbsp;consensus is that we must look at this challenge as one of our Singaporean values.&nbsp; In the schools, in our family, in society, we must look at this responsibility as our shared value.&nbsp; If we do not have this consensus, this shared <p align=left>Column: 603<p>value of giving birth to more children for our future generation, then how are we going to accomplish this cause?&nbsp; I look at the individuals, the family, the community, the employers and the Government as the five stakeholders, and these five stakeholders&nbsp;must arrive at this consensus.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they do not have this consensus, no matter how you talk about it, you will not come to a solution, because we should&nbsp;know first what we have to do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, we mentioned a lot of facilities, a lot of measures to promote procreation. I would like to touch on a few points.&nbsp; First, apart from changing our values, we need to change our mindset on our emphasis on the pursuit of economic development and work performance. Before I talk about the fiscal incentives and facilities, another change we need to make is on our work.&nbsp; &nbsp;If everyone of us wants to be an outstanding worker, do we have the time to also become an outstanding family person?&nbsp; We are not machines, we are not deities.&nbsp; How are we going to keep on working 24 hours a day?&nbsp; Another thing is on how we evaluate the work performance of a person. We cannot use the old standards to evaluate the work performance.&nbsp; We should also look at the quality of the work that he produces, his output, the &nbsp; quality of his work, to evaluate. Just because a worker starts work from <st1:time Hour=\"7\" Minute=\"0\">7.00 am</st1:time> and goes home only at <st1:time Hour=\"0\" Minute=\"0\">midnight</st1:time>, we cannot jump to the conclusion that he is a good worker.&nbsp; We should not look at it in this way.&nbsp; We should only look at the quality of his output.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to change the mindset of Singaporeans. Firstly, we have to look at the bearing of children as one of our shared values.&nbsp; Secondly, on the economic side, from the Government down to the employers, we should change the criteria of evaluating the work<p align=left>Column: 604<p> performance of the workers by tying it with their family lives, so that there will be a good work-life balance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let me look at the intangible measures.&nbsp; Just now, I mentioned that, in fact, in the last few days, I have looked at the various incentive measures, and there are more than 50 of them.&nbsp; In fact, the Government has already done a lot in tax reliefs, in public education in the schools, and creches.&nbsp; The Government has made a lot of arrangements.&nbsp; But there is still room for improvement for these arrangements, for example, in work arrangements. &nbsp; In the past, as a trade unionist, I was quite sceptical about the five-day week idea.&nbsp; Recently, after visiting some MNCs, such as IBM, AT&amp;T and Shell, &nbsp; I dropped &nbsp; my reservations on &nbsp; the five-day week.&nbsp; Take Shell, for example.&nbsp;They function 365 days a year and&nbsp;7 days a week.&nbsp; But most of their workers work only a five-day week.&nbsp; So, we should not hesitate in the move towards a five-day week arrangement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should have more flexibility, with the Government in the lead. Our quasi-Government departments and statutory boards should restructure themselves, so that we can adopt the five-day week.&nbsp; Just now, I mentioned about this flexible work arrangement.&nbsp; Now, we have the computer, fax, email and video conferencing.&nbsp; We can use these new technologies to re-engineer our work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, I attended a conference where an American professor gave a talk.&nbsp; Physically, he was in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but we could raise questions with him and have real time discussion through&nbsp; video conferencing.&nbsp; In some countries, they even use the video to conduct lectures.&nbsp; They do not have to be physically present in the lecture hall.&nbsp; Now, we have people all rushing to work at the same time.&nbsp; Why can we not arrange to have &nbsp; flexible working hours and staggered time for our workers?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 605<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we should all sit down and feedback to Mr Lim Hng Kiang and his committee our suggestions as MPs, Mayors, employers, or Ministers.&nbsp; Everyone should play a part.&nbsp; For example, you say, if I want to start an enterprise, everyone should tell the Minister what they want to do, and not tell the Minister what to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a family, parents help their children to look after their children.&nbsp; So, in a family, you can say, \"Young people go ahead, have more children.&nbsp; When I retire, I will help you to look after your children.\"&nbsp; In our community, we should have more facilities, such as childcare centres and even baby-care centres.&nbsp; Now the Government provides &nbsp; subsidies for childcare centres.&nbsp; But I think the facilities for the care of babies are still not enough.&nbsp; I will raise this during our Committee of Supply on Health and MCDS.&nbsp; But I think the Government has not given any subsidy for the cost of looking after babies at home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another aspect is on education.&nbsp; Personally, I am very proud of our education system.&nbsp; Whenever I am overseas, when people ask me, \"Which policy in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> are you most proud of?\",&nbsp;I would reply that I am most proud of our education system in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Because, in Singapore, every child, irrespective of family background, whether rich or poor,&nbsp; has the chance to go to school and the opportunity to make full use of their potential.&nbsp; Even then, I cannot say our education system is perfect.&nbsp; We can still look at rooms for improvement. We want to cultivate our children into useful citizens. This is again a question of output.&nbsp; Do we want to cultivate an engineer, a lawyer, a technician, a doctor or an all-rounded person?&nbsp; We want to cultivate the children, so that they can make full use of the potential in every aspect, eg, in the arts, sports and even in hotel catering, in <p align=left>Column: 606<p>business, science, law and leadership quality.&nbsp; Everyone has different talents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the views expressed by the Acting Minister for Education in an interview by the <I>Straits Times</I>.&nbsp; I think we should make every child&nbsp;give full play of their potential, so that they can have the opportunity to express themselves.&nbsp; We can say that all parents in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> place great emphasis on the education of their children.&nbsp; We should give priority to school enrolment for the third child.&nbsp; I think this would be even more attractive than fiscal incentives.&nbsp; Now, we have given more autonomy to the schools and universities to enrol the students, I think it is very good.&nbsp; I think we should also give this autonomy to our junior colleges and secondary schools. If they want to go for one session, full-day school, and for schools to have childcare centres, we should help them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every family's need is different.&nbsp; When we want to take these measures, we should not think that, by giving a Baby Bonus, everything is resolved.&nbsp; That is not good enough.&nbsp; This time, we are suggesting extended maternity leave. &nbsp; Will it solve everything?&nbsp; It may be a good measure, but not a perfect solution.&nbsp; It is not to say that everyone will take the six-month maternity leave.&nbsp; Some would say we want to breast feed, so we may have to take six months' leave.&nbsp; But some females may have siblings or parents to look after the baby, they may not need such a long maternity leave and they would prefer to convert this maternity leave to family leave so that they can take leave in a more flexible manner.&nbsp; We should look at this maternity leave issue in a more flexible way.&nbsp; Just now, I mentioned about this Baby Bonus. For this fiscal incentive, we give bonuses for the second and third children.&nbsp; Some families do not even have the first child.&nbsp; Although money is not the absolute factor to encourage child birth, I think this would, in some way, help to cut down on their <p align=left>Column: 607<p>financial costs.&nbsp;I also feel that there are too many&nbsp;rules, eg, you must give birth within a certain period, etc.&nbsp; So, if&nbsp;late birth is not an issue, why should we make it so complicated?&nbsp; So long as you produce the birth certificate, whether you have a second or third child, I just give you the money, that is all.&nbsp; Why all these terms and conditions?&nbsp; Maybe we should not give them cash, lest they misuse it.&nbsp; Maybe we could have a trust fund for medical fees, education fees, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another issue is on marriage itself. &nbsp; I think marriage itself is a problem.&nbsp; If you do not get married, how do we have babies?&nbsp; So, I think this is very important.&nbsp; The MCDS has already started the Public Education Committee to promote this, through the schools, the religious bodies and the clan associations. Talking about &nbsp; the clan associations, &nbsp; recently, the Minister of State Mr Chan Soo Sen said that the clan associations seemed to have nothing much to do nowadays.&nbsp; To this, I would say that there are a lot of things they could do. They can help to promote marriage and the bearing of children.&nbsp; I hope that the clan associations will encourage the young people to get married, and get married early.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, my suggestion will also have to take into consideration the fact that the boys have problems because of National Service, although I fully support National Service.&nbsp; Some people say that the best time to start courting is when you finish your&nbsp; 'A' levels or polytechnic, and that it is the best time to start courting!&nbsp; We should give them a \"gap year\" after the 'A' levels or the polytechnic, so that the young boys could catch up with the young girls to do some social, charitable or welfare work together.&nbsp; This need not be confined only to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; They can even go to other countries, so that they can cultivate the relationship, to experience social contacts with the<p align=left>Column: 608<p> opposite sex. &nbsp; So, I feel that we could look into the possibility of providing for such a \"gap year\". Maybe the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Community Development and Sports could look into how to create more chances for the young people to socialise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should have this motto: \"We are behind you!\" &nbsp; Now, a lot of young people are worried.&nbsp; They say, \"You want us to have children, but we do not even have a steady job, what certainty can we have for our future?\"&nbsp; &nbsp; If we can say \"We are behind you\", not only the parents will say it, our friends and relatives should also say it.&nbsp; Our siblings, if their children are grown up, we should also help our younger brothers and sisters to look after their children.&nbsp; The employers should also say, eg, \"All right, if you want to take leave, we can do this, we can do that, and we will support you.\"&nbsp; And for those young people who are just married, we should show that we are behind them. Give them the assurance that help is available, as and when they need it. So, with this national effort, ie, the parents, siblings, families, Mayors, MPs, we can show the young couples that \"We are behind you\". Let us do it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</B> With your kind permission, Sir, I too would like to join in this Great Baby Debate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, last year, I came across this very interesting report.&nbsp; This is a 2003 global survey on sexual attitudes and behaviour conducted by Durex, a condom manufacturer, and it covered over&nbsp;150,000 people in 34 countries.&nbsp; The survey found that Singapore adults were the least amorous in the world.&nbsp; For once, we did not turn out to be Number 1 in a survey.&nbsp; Not only did our results rank last in the world for the number of times that our adults&nbsp;had sex in a year, we were also the only nation where the number fell below what the survey called the magic 100 mark - to be exact, only 96 times a <p align=left>Column: 609<p>year.&nbsp; Some of us may want to take the Durex report with a pinch of salt.&nbsp; But it is one more way of looking at the problem of declining births.&nbsp; If Singaporeans are, firstly, not inclined to be passionately romantic, how are we going to produce babies?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, amidst all this search for schemes to make sure that our young adults produce babies, I think we may have to start from the starting point.&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot be more colourful and more graphic,&nbsp;but how can we get them to be more romantic and&nbsp;to be more passionate about romance and, hopefully, then allow nature to take its course?&nbsp; But, as they say, Singapore is not a very romantic place.&nbsp; And how can you blame them?&nbsp; If one were to take a walk past some of our office blocks at night, one might not be too surprised to see how many offices are still lighted up.&nbsp; One will find young accountants auditing their books in order to meet quarterly reporting deadlines; lawyers scrambling to have agreements drawn up because their clients have to complete their deals by the morning; and bankers dealing with financial markets that are still open elsewhere because of differences in time zones.&nbsp; So, small wonder that many couples, young or old, rarely find the time for one another, let alone think of having a child.&nbsp; Most are too exhausted after a long day and night at work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this has been a society which urges everyone to work hard or you would not survive.&nbsp; Strive for excellence, compete or perish.&nbsp; This has&nbsp;been the Government's mantra for decades.&nbsp; Nothing wrong with this, mind you, except that, faced with this kind of stress, parents do not want to have children who will also have to face the prospects of their own rat race in the future.&nbsp; So, it does not take much logic to reason why many opt to have just one quality child who can take on the world when his or her time comes.&nbsp; They can then focus all their resources on that one<p align=left>Column: 610<p> child, and that includes paying for all types of private tuition needed to make sure that little junior scores straight A's in his examinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;A <I>Straits Times</I> survey recently found that it costs $77,000 just to pay for a child's education from pre-primary to university level.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can we do to make couples change their minds and have at least two children?&nbsp; That is the burning question we have to deal with.&nbsp; We tried financial and tax incentives but have found that they do not work.&nbsp; And I am not so sure that rolling out more taxpayers' money is the only solution to our problem.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither is providing more paid maternity leave the panacea for our ills.&nbsp; Much has been made of the reservations expressed about extended maternity leave, not just by employers but even by some women employees themselves.&nbsp; And&nbsp;I do not&nbsp;wish to repeat them here.&nbsp; But let me just add that extended paid maternity leave is a tried formula in many countries that has brought only mixed results.&nbsp; In Italy, for example, a woman gets 20 weeks of paid maternity leave; in Austria, 16 weeks; Hungary, 24 weeks; Spain, 16 weeks; Japan and Germany, both have 14 weeks.&nbsp; Yet, all these countries have Total Fertility Rates (TFRs) close to or below ours.&nbsp; Yes, there are a few countries with long periods of paid maternity leave and higher TFRs.&nbsp; But none has reached replacement fertility.&nbsp; Interestingly enough, the United States and New Zealand are two countries with unpaid maternity leave: 12 weeks in the US, and 14 weeks in New Zealand, and the US has a TFR of 2.11 and New Zealand, 2.01, close to replacement rate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are women who feel that long maternity leave is in fact disruptive to their work and careers.&nbsp; Paternity leave has been suggested too, but I think this is probably not a good solution.&nbsp; If our male citizens have to do reservist training for up to 42 days in a year,&nbsp;any additional <p align=left>Column: 611<p>days off from work would be highly disruptive to any organisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people, Sir, would prefer, say, half a day off or a day off mid-week to spend with their children,&nbsp;in other words, a move towards more flexible working arrangements.&nbsp; Perhaps we might want to make a national move towards a 5-day working week, so that all of us can spend more quality time with our families.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other policies can also be relooked.&nbsp; A case in point is the foreign maid levy, a policy to contain the number of foreign maids working in Singapore.&nbsp; Sir, with 140,000 maids in Singapore, each attracting a levy of $345 a month, it has actually become a very convenient cash cow for the Government to milk.&nbsp; But then it is parents who suffer because, with the levy, a maid today can cost&nbsp;between $600 and $700 a month.&nbsp; This is no small sum for a young couple.&nbsp; Do they turn to parents for help in raising the child?&nbsp; Not likely because, in many instances, some parents and&nbsp;in-laws would probably still be working.&nbsp; But if we really want to ease the worries of young working couples who need someone to take care of their children when they are at work, then we must lighten the burden of hiring someone.&nbsp; It is not the ideal solution, I agree, to have someone else, not least a foreigner, bring up one's child.&nbsp; But the Government must examine its priority in this area: whether to continue with what is viewed by many as a revenue-raising measure, or whether it wants to achieve a larger social objective.&nbsp; If it is to be the latter, then the Government must be prepared to bite the bullet on this and consider lowering the levy.</p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we are talking of foreigners, let me just add how painful it is, as an MP, for me sometimes to come across cases of Singaporeans who are denied permission to marry the person they love<p align=left>Column: 612<p> because their desired spouse happens to be a work permit holder.&nbsp; On the one hand, we lament the low rate of success of the Government's match-making agency, the Social Development Unit, but we readily deny those who find love on their own, just because one partner happens to carry a card that says, \"You are here to work only, and you cannot marry a Singaporean.\"&nbsp; Or what about the many Singaporeans&nbsp;who have foreign spouses, but we tell the foreign spouses that \"Marriage to a Singaporean does not confer on you the automatic right to live in Singapore\"?&nbsp; Many such couples want to start families in Singapore, but our rigid immigration rules do not even allow them to live together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we want to make every baby count, we need to re-examine the rationale behind some of these rules and find ways to relax them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is another area I am concerned about in the Budget Statement, and this is the intention of the Government to raise fees for university students.&nbsp; While it may be a simple solution to suggest that students need not worry too much about the coming increase in fees as they can always pay later when they are working, the Government may be unwittingly adding to our procreation blues.&nbsp; Can you imagine that we would end up having young people who will already be in debt the day they graduate?&nbsp; Repaying their study loan will of course have to be their priority.&nbsp; This means delaying their ability to marry early and start a home and their family, because there would be the mortgage to think of, and you do not want to think of another loan until you have got the first one off your back.&nbsp; In fact, one would-be parent in his 30s put the problem to me in another way.&nbsp; He said, \"If I have a son and I look after him, I will have to look after him for actually a quarter of a century because, by the time he completes his NS and he graduates, he would be close to 25 years of age and I will be close to 60.&nbsp; If I have a second<p align=left>Column: 613<p> son a few years later, that would take me to over 60 years of age, and I shudder to think if I also have to help them pay their university loans.&nbsp; And the Government is telling me that there is no such thing as life-long employment, and I am seeing many of my friends becoming unemployed in their mid-40s.&nbsp; So, I think having one child is already dicey enough.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are many changes that we can make to encourage couples to have children and, no doubt, we will hear many more ideas in the next two days.&nbsp; It is a serious problem we are faced with, and I find it disconcerting to read stories in the newspapers that seem to glorify those who do not want to have children.&nbsp; Sir, last week, the <I>Straits Times</I> ran a series of articles over some days.&nbsp; One story last week showed a couple looking very happy with the headline saying: \"No rushing the stork\".&nbsp; Next to this was a picture of another couple with their child and it read:&nbsp; \"One is enough for now\".&nbsp; Then, a few days later - to be exact, last Saturday - there was another</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Another story the same day had another reporter who&nbsp;simply said that she could not stand bawling babies around her, forgetting that all of us at one time or another must have been pesky little kids to another generation of adults.&nbsp; Not only that, she said that having babies would surely put&nbsp;paid to her plans for going on holidays and&nbsp;there was no way anything the Government could do to make her change her mind about having a child.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think such stories are not helpful to what we are trying to achieve.&nbsp; I think what we need to have is more pro-family stories.&nbsp; Let me say that as one who is a parent, there is nothing more fulfilling than having and bringing up your own children.&nbsp; Both my wife and I have had to pursue our own careers but we have<p align=left>Column: 614<p> shared the joys of parenthood.&nbsp; In raising our children, we had been through their ups and downs with them and we had shared their trials and tribulations.&nbsp; There have been times when they have made me angry but there&nbsp;had been&nbsp;many more moments when they have made me happy and proud.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To those who still eschew the idea of&nbsp; having children, let me ask them to look some 30 years into the future and ask themselves what kind of Singapore will we then have.&nbsp; Would&nbsp;it not be a Singapore lacking&nbsp;the vibrancy that we now have?&nbsp; Let me ask them who is going to look after them when they can no longer look after themselves?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is no one size solution to fit all in this issue. Mr Lim Hng Kiang and his Committee have an unenviable task to find the solutions, and&nbsp;they may not even find them all by National Day but he deserves our support.&nbsp; The problem is such a perplexing one, and it is so crucial for our long-term survival, maybe even more so than Dr Ng Eng Hen, he needs to have his bonus pegged&nbsp;to how successful he can produce babies for us.&nbsp; Sir, no pun intended, of course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp; I agree with the previous speakers that this is indeed an interesting Budget.&nbsp; It deals not only with specific issues of concern to the economy but, of equal importance, it sets important outlines on issues of significance&nbsp;to us as a society.<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of economic issues, the focus of this year's Budget is on enhancing Singapore's competitive edge. In this respect, this year's Budget continues with the process that was started last year to put in place some of the key recommendations of the ERC. Some Singaporeans have expressed disappointment though, that there are no goodies for the individuals, except for the <p align=left>Column: 615<p>Medisave top-up for those above 50 years of age, whereas many incentives were given to companies. To the extent that this Budget will help to further strengthen companies and attract more investments, I hope that there will be a trickle down effect, and ultimately all Singaporeans will benefit.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now make specific comments on some aspects of this Budget.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of halting the falling birth rate, I agree with&nbsp;DPM that a comprehensive approach is needed. To me the issues that we are confronted with can be categorised into three areas: cost, time and supporting infrastructure. In NTUC, our Women's Committee had conducted dialogue sessions with a few hundred women leaders and activists. The feedback that came across loud and clear is that cost is still a major factor affecting a couple's decision on whether or not to have children and, if so, how many.&nbsp; In this connection, many had said that they were not looking at just the cost at the time of the birth of a child, but to them, it is a whole process from infancy to adulthood. On the issue of time, many women also pointed out that there were insufficient alternative work arrangements, such as part-time work or teleworking, to widen their choices after childbirth. Currently, their only choices are to stay at home to look after the children or to remain in the workforce. Additionally, many also felt that there is a need for a more supportive environment at the workplace for working parents. In this connection, of course, we have been working very closely with the MCDS in order to promote work-life balance at the workplace, and we are happy to say that there are some positive results but more could be done.&nbsp; In Japan, for instance, there is a good percentage of women doing telework.&nbsp; In the Scandinavian&nbsp;countries where there is a high female <p align=left>Column: 616<p>labour force participation rate, there&nbsp;are many flexible work arrangements for working mothers.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the proposal to lengthen their maternity leave, despite many misgivings,&nbsp;is an important one to me as it will also partly overcome the problem of lack of affordable infant care facilities. But the issue of discrimination against women will have to be dealt with, as many women are concerned about how the improved benefits will affect them in the job market. The point to note here is that in most of the countries where there are generous benefits for women to take care of the family, there&nbsp;is also legislation to protect their right to keep their jobs after they return to work and to provide a system for women who are discriminated against to file a complaint. It will be interesting to see whether without such a supporting legislation the measures that are put in place here will be effective to prevent discrimination against women. In this context, I would like to suggest that even if the Government is not prepared to consider legislation at this point of time, nevertheless, it needs to put a mechanism in place to monitor the impact of such policies, otherwise the market will take care of itself. Women will not avail themselves of the longer maternity leave and have more babies because they fear they&nbsp;may lose their jobs. As one employer had put it in a newspaper interview recently, if it was just too troublesome he would not employ women.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other way of ensuring that there will be no discrimination against women if they avail themselves of the longer maternity leave is to extend this benefit to fathers as well.&nbsp; I am not saying that fathers will now start conceiving but what I am saying is that we could describe this additional period of leave as parental care leave which&nbsp;can be enjoyed by either the father or the mother.&nbsp; In this way, the disruption to the workplace and cost to the employer will be spread out.&nbsp; At the <p align=left>Column: 617<p>same time, we also encourage fathers to assume greater responsibility over child-rearing and family responsibilities.&nbsp; Over time, this will by itself create a momentum, in terms of changing of society's norms and perceptions about work and family.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would also like to add that we should not view this issue of procreation from a narrow, temporary perspective of how many babies will be born to support our economic growth or contribute to our GDP. If we cast this entire debate and put all our efforts to boost the birth rate solely from a purely economic angle, we may see some results in the short term, but I doubt that it will be truly sustainable in the long term. Economics and society are inextricably bound and intertwined. The policies that we adopt do shape our society. They are a reflection of our values, and they send important messages to our youths about what we value. A society that values children, parenthood and the family is far different from a society that does not.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ongoing debate that we are having today is healthy as it enables more people to buy into the idea. Through this process, we can then develop a consensus on the kind of society that we want and what we are prepared as Singaporeans - the Government, employers, workers and everyone who has a stake here - to put in place to support these values.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, how to address Singapore's declining fertility rate is not an easy issue.&nbsp; It is a complex and intricate issue involving many facets.&nbsp; The current approach however has serious limitations as they are ad-hoc and it is not multi-agency except when a problem crops up and a committee is set up to deal with the issue as we are now doing.&nbsp; I would like to suggest therefore that the Government seriously consider setting up a multi-agency body that will champion issues<p align=left>Column: 618<p> concerning the family and would also act as a sounding board for all policies or programmes that will impact on the family.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now come to the other points in the Budget.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister has given us an overall assessment of the economy. Singapore continues to remain as a competitive manufacturing location especially for high-tech, high value-added activities. However, in the same breath, we are also told that the manufacturing sector is not likely to generate many more jobs as MNCs are shifting to higher value-added, less labour-intensive activities, and will increase output per worker rather than hire more workers. Hence, to create more jobs for Singaporeans, there will be strong emphasis on the services sector. But looking at the trend that is taking place today, there is&nbsp;cause for concern. Many companies are outsourcing their services. In the past, only blue collar, manufacturing jobs are outsourced but today outsourcing involves white collar and higher value-added jobs as well. Even the Government is outsourcing, a trend which the Finance Minister has stressed will continue and in fact even intensified through the Best Sourcing Directive of the Ministry of Finance.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this light, my question&nbsp;is where are the jobs coming from? Will the number of jobs that are created be enough to cover the number of school leavers entering the job market and soak up those who are retrenched or unemployed? What more can be done to encourage companies that are based here to try and retain the jobs in Singapore, and even if they have to outsource, to do so to local companies? Has there been an assessment of the impact of outsourcing on our economy and jobs and with the growth of India and China, what will be the future implications? Will outsourcing intensify<p align=left>Column: 619<p> and, if so, which are the more vulnerable sectors?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important that we address these questions as the concern down the ground continues to be whether enough jobs will be created&nbsp;-&nbsp;a&nbsp;concern which is further compounded by the announcement that we will be making permanent residents here much more attractive in order to attract more foreigners to sink their roots here.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I can also see a certain contradiction in&nbsp;our policies.&nbsp; On the one hand, the focus is on creating more higher value-added jobs for Singaporeans. But at the same time, the policies affecting the employment of foreign workers are made more liberal. I am referring specifically to the new category of \"S\" passes that are being created to replace the Q2 passes. Unlike the R passes for skilled and semi-skilled workers, and the P passes for professional workers, the \"S\" passes are meant to attract the middle-tier skilled workers with diploma and post-secondary level education. The feedback I have received is that Singaporeans fear that the \"S\" pass workers will pose a direct competition to our polytechnic and university graduates. It is not competition <I>per se</I> that Singaporeans are concerned about.&nbsp; Rather, their concern is that they may pose an unfair competition with Singaporeans because they&nbsp;can be&nbsp;employed at much lower cost than Singaporeans, as their minimum salary is only $1,800.&nbsp;There is also no restriction on their countries of origin compared to the previous Q2 passes that are now being abolished. This concern has some basis as last year's retrenchment figures show that a higher proportion of those retrenched are executives. With the presence of the \"S\" passes, this will be the category that will find it even more difficult to get employment if they are retrenched. I note in particular that the \"S\" passes will now be open to the healthcare, IT, aerospace and <p align=left>Column: 620<p>pharmaceutical sectors.&nbsp; These are high value-added industries and, if Singaporeans have to compete with foreigners even in these job sectors, I wonder how that would impact on the employment prospects of diploma holders and university graduates.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember reading last week's report in the <I>Straits</I> <I>Times</I> that one in five polytechnic graduates ends up in a part-time job. I would therefore like to ask the DPM and Finance Minister, if he could kindly give an assurance that Singaporeans will not be displaced by foreigners and that our policies will continue to give priority to Singaporeans for good, high value-added jobs, now that the gates have been opened even wider. Although there is a limit of 5% imposed on the number of&nbsp; \"S\" passes, based on past precedents, we know that it will only be a matter of time before employers agitate for an increase.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am particularly curious, Sir,&nbsp;why we have a shortage of such manpower that is now the target of the \"S\" passes, considering that we now have 5 polytechnics and two universities and we aim for a 60% rate in terms of the cohort entering university by 2010.&nbsp; Does this indicate that our planning and manpower projections are not as effective as it should be in meeting the needs of the various sectors of the economy?&nbsp; What more can be done to systematically identify areas or sectors in the economy where jobs are being created and to prepare Singaporeans for these jobs so that we will not have a situation where even higher value-added jobs end up with foreign workers?<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I strongly support the decision to raise the Skills Development Levy's salary ceiling from $1,500 to $1,800 in line with the increase in the number of training places that is projected from now onwards. Training and skills upgrading is of critical importance to our <p align=left>Column: 621<p>workers to enable them to remain employable and this increase is, in fact, long overdue. However, there are limitations to the current system.&nbsp; Workers continue to complain that employers are not prepared to train them for skills that are not relevant to their current job.&nbsp; Workers, on the other hand, are concerned that if they stick only to job-related training, they may not be prepared for other jobs when they are retrenched. Workers are prepared to go for training at their own time even, but do need assistance in funding.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I would, therefore, like to urge the Government to consider some means of assisting workers who wish to attend non-job related training but which will prepare them for other sectors of the economy. We have mooted the idea of individual learning accounts on several occasions but somehow this has not received much support. &nbsp;I would, therefore, like to ask for Government support again for this idea of an individual learning account for workers, in line with our focus to develop lifelong learning.&nbsp; The Government can consider opening an account for every working adult with a CPF account and regularly topping this account&nbsp;much in the same manner that it has done in topping up the Medisave account for those above 50. In my view, this will go a long way towards promoting lifelong learning and employability.&nbsp; It also sends a strong signal of Government's support for individual efforts at improving themselves.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now come to the next point, Sir. &nbsp;This year, there will be a 2% cut in the budget for all the Ministries except MINDEF, and this will apply for FY 2004 and FY 2005.&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I understand the rationale - revenues have become increasingly constrained because of the growth volatility and the reduction in corporate tax and other incentives given to companies have also affected the<p align=left>Column: 622<p> revenue stream. &nbsp;Nevertheless, my concern is whether this would have an impact on the Government's social expenditure. &nbsp;Will this have an impact on the social assistance programmes run by the Ministries for the poor and needy and will these affect subsidies for services such as health and education?&nbsp; I understand the need to balance the budget and to reduce deficits, nevertheless, my concern is how this will impact on help for low income families as there are still many who need help.&nbsp; Although the retrenchment rate is expected to be lower this year, the rate of unemployment is still high and many Singaporeans continue to need help to secure jobs.&nbsp; And, even those who are working will require support since their salaries may not be sufficient to meet basic needs.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir,&nbsp;I come to the point on Best Sourcing. &nbsp;This requires public sector agencies to undertake \"market testing\", so as to compare the cost of providing their services in-house against the cost of having private sector vendors provide the services. &nbsp;If private sector vendors can deliver the service more economically, they will be engaged to do so. &nbsp;The public sector will then discontinue doing the function.&nbsp; The public sector agency will then discontinue the function, and either redeploy or release the affected staff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the rationale for Best Sourcing is understandable, nevertheless, in view of the current economic climate and the still high unemployment rate, there are concerns among public sector employees. &nbsp;The older public sector employees feel particularly vulnerable. &nbsp;Many fear that they will not get jobs so easily if they were retrenched as a result of Best Sourcing, particularly since employers today are still biased against older workers. &nbsp;Many have also asked whether there is a need for the Government to also behave like the private sector, particularly<p align=left>Column: 623<p> when the job market is still soft.&nbsp; Some were also concerned that when jobs were outsourced these may invariably end up in the hands of foreign workers. There were also concerns that some public sector management may invoke the Special Gratuity Scheme instead of the Special Resignation Scheme in order to remove surplus staff. &nbsp;The payment under the Special Gratuity Scheme is much lower compared to that under the Special Resignation Scheme, although the Special Gratuity Scheme is not meant to cover redundancy situations. &nbsp;These concerns, Sir,&nbsp;should be addressed so as not to affect the morale of public sector employees.&nbsp; As far as possible, all efforts should be made to redeploy affected staff. &nbsp;If it is not possible to continue employing them, then they should be informed in advance and assisted in securing alternative employment or to undergo training in order to prepare them for other jobs.&nbsp; I would appreciate, Sir, if these concerns can be addressed.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public sector employees perform an important role in our economy.&nbsp; The public employment practices have undergone tremendous changes over the last few years, the most recent one being the revision of the SRS, and last year there was a major restructuring exercise at the HDB.&nbsp; Public sector employees are aware that they can no longer expect an iron rice bowl, and public sector unions have been at the forefront in bringing the message of change to their members.&nbsp; Public sector employees are also aware that employment practices cannot be fossilised and they must expect greater alignment with the private sector.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is important that, in the face of the budget cuts and the push for Best Sourcing, we ensure that public sector employees continue to feel confident that they have good career prospects and their concerns for stability and job security are addressed.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 624<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I see expenditure in education as an important and necessary investment in our people. I am, therefore, concerned that if the universities are allowed to set their own fees, university education may become too expensive and out of reach of low and middle income Singaporeans.&nbsp; True, we should get students to pay a higher proportion of the fees but we should not kill the Singapore&nbsp;dream where everyone aspires for a better life through education.&nbsp; Although there may be loan schemes available, I wonder whether it is really good to have so many young Singaporeans, like Mr Tan Soo Khoon said before me,&nbsp;burdened by a high level of indebtedness when they leave the university.&nbsp; Again, like Mr Tan, I also wonder&nbsp;how this would affect their decision to get married, buy a house and have children.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like to urge that we continue to ensure that university fees remain affordable to Singaporeans.&nbsp; I do not see university education as benefiting the individual more, compared to investments in primary or secondary education.&nbsp; We are a small country, Sir, and people are our only asset, coupled with the fact that many of the investments that we are bringing in are high value-added ones, there is certainly a need for more people with university qualifications.&nbsp; It was not so long ago that Mr Philip Yeo who said that in the life sciences sector, those who have the first degree are only fit to wash test-tubes.&nbsp; Hence, I would like to urge the Government to ensure that university education will continue to remain affordable and within the reach of the average Singaporean family.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on means testing for hospital care, I agree with the principle that we need to focus subsidies on those who need them, and so make the most of our healthcare budget.&nbsp; However, usually the devil lies in the details, and I would like to urge that before we introduce any means testing for <p align=left>Column: 625<p>hospital care, we should study the issue very carefully.&nbsp; I know that means testing has already been applied for step-down care and in a few other services, but hospital care is a different kettle of fish, as the cost involved is much more and, for those suffering from catastrophic illnessess, the medical bills are huge.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans who are really poor, and the upper income, will have fewer problems, but those caught in-between may face difficulties.&nbsp; Likewise, those who suffer from a prolonged illness, even though they may be enjoying a certain income level, will have their savings wiped out and little monthly income to support their medical needs.&nbsp; We also have to bear in mind that we are an ageing society, and we now want families to have more children.&nbsp; If, as a result of the new means testing policy, they have to pay more in terms of hospital care, then our efforts at promoting procreation may be affected if families feel that they have to incur increased liabilities in meeting the healthcare needs of their children.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Singaporeans today are saddled with multiple responsibilities.&nbsp; In addition to taking care of their own children, many have the responsibility of taking care of old and sickly parents.&nbsp; If we use income alone as a yardstick, it may not be very helpful, as a person may be earning a certain income but it may not be sufficient for him to take care of his multiple needs.&nbsp; Policy-making, Sir, is not an easy process and there are risks associated with any policy.&nbsp; We do not want to see a situation where, because of certain policies, people do not seek treatment or they neglect their aged parents.&nbsp; I do urge the Government to study these issues very carefully before proceeding with means testing, as healthcare is an issue which is close to the hearts of many Singaporeans.&nbsp; Means testing should not be the only way in which we control healthcare cost in Singapore.&nbsp; A lot more has to be done to <p align=left>Column: 626<p>ensure that healthcare remains affordable, particularly, continuous efforts like identifying and addressing the areas which had caused the cost of hospital care to balloon over the years.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</B> Sir, I rise to support the Budget.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The measures as proposed will continue to position Singapore as a land of opportunity for businesses, as well as for enterprising individuals.&nbsp; The proposed 2% budget cuts for most Ministries will steer effective government, with expenses closely in check.&nbsp; I am confident that with the structural adjustment in place in our tax system for businesses, thereby enhancing our competitiveness, we will be able to take advantage of the positive change in the economic environment, raise our sails once again and capitalise on another rising tide in the global economy in the coming years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding this cautious optimism, however, one has to be realistic.&nbsp; The global economy and indeed the geo-political landscape have changed in complexity significantly in the last decade.&nbsp; Economic business cycles have become much shorter.&nbsp; Shocks have become more periodic, and even endemic, as in the case of terrorism.&nbsp; Global competition is especially keen with the emerging economies of India and China, a great opportunity for the nimble, but a threat for economies which rest on their laurels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as the private sector has had to adjust to the new economic realities, to be nimble, flexible and cost-efficient,&nbsp; it is imperative that our public sector also responds in kind so as not to crowd out private initiatives.&nbsp; I, therefore, applaud the DPM and Finance Minister for further cutting the size of the public sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I noted, and more so as Chairman of the Estimates Committee in this House,<p align=left>Column: 627<p> that reducing the size of the public sector has been a deliberate policy of the Government over the past years, and rightly so.&nbsp; However, it is clear that this long-term task is even more relevant in an era where Government revenues have been increasingly constrained by shorter business cycles and volatile growth since the financial crisis in 1997, in contrast to the robust high growth era between 1987 and 1996.&nbsp; Indeed, according to the Institute of Policy Studies, the cost of government, as measured by the ratio of operating expenditure to the GDP, has hovered around 10% since the 1990s, down from 15% in the 1980s, while tax revenue looks set to dip below 8% in this decade.&nbsp; Government social expenditure, which accounts for close to 44% of the budget,&nbsp;is likely to impose further burden on the economy.&nbsp; This is because of our ageing population trends, and especially in terms of healthcare and old-age related welfare costs.&nbsp; Our increasingly vocal electorate also has a tendency to demand rebates and subsidies as a right from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst we have consistently taken the rational practical approach, one has to recognise that in addressing some of these demands from time to time, a further stress on Government's coffers can be expected.&nbsp; Singaporeans have to recognise that there is no free lunch all the time.&nbsp; We cannot continue to expect more handouts and tax reliefs over time if we are seeing a falling revenue trend and if there are no corresponding cuts in Government expenditure.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, Sir, the&nbsp;cost of running an over-sized government has to be funded from higher taxes, public debts, further privatisation of Government assets or dipping into accumulated reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, whilst the Government has been proactive by proposing another budgetary <p align=left>Column: 628<p>deficit of $0.7 billion in this year's Budget, I believe the principle of achieving a budget surplus over a business cycle must be maintained.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>I believe this is a right-thinking philosophy that will enable Singapore to steer clear of structural budget deficits in the long run.&nbsp; We must guard against increasing demands&nbsp;from all sectors of society for handouts and wean Singaporeans away from a&nbsp;dependency mindset.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with this philosophy, I would like to urge the Government to continue with the implementation of means testing, not just in healthcare but also move away from across-the-board distribution of social handouts.&nbsp; Instead, we should have a more coordinated approach in delivering social assistance schemes, so that distribution will&nbsp; reach only those that really are in need of them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note, for example, that the revenue impact of GST, raised in stages from 3% to 5% over the years, has been more than offset by handouts in the form of rebates and subsidies.&nbsp; However, Singaporeans, some genuinely burdened by difficult economic conditions and others who are happy to free ride along, are both beneficiaries of mass distribution.&nbsp; Indeed, some have even considered that it is a right entitled to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this perception that rebates and subsidies are rights that can be given in perpetuity has to be corrected, or it will add an ever increasing strain on our fiscal drawers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Correspondingly, I support the various initiatives that have been taken by Government, directly and indirectly, to support education for consumers and citizens from personal financial responsibilities and discipline.&nbsp; As a longer-term measure, perhaps the Education Ministry should also consider how such concepts, including public fiscal prudence, can be inculcated among our young in schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 629<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the overall Budget, the 2% budgetary cut across-the-board for all Ministries except MINDEF, in my mind, is a step in the right direction.&nbsp; The cut does serve as a wake-up call to all Government Ministries.&nbsp; It is no longer business as usual.&nbsp; However, I would like to ask if it does go far enough.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current budgets in individual Ministries have evolved over the years, in many cases, in response to ad-hoc policies for social expenditure of specific needs in the Ministry, implemented as a right policy at that time but not necessarily the most relevant now, or necessarily well-targeted or coordinated with other Ministries and schemes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Finance, in allocating the budget, looks at the previous year's annual expenditure numbers and sets a target for growth or contraction of the Ministry's budget on an overall basis, leaving individual Ministries to allocate within, by and large.&nbsp; Hence, with a 2% cut to be implemented, we could end up micro-managing Ministries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ministries could end up focusing on cutting stationery, staff amenities and benefits and other perceived easy to tackle \"wastes\".&nbsp; This is likely to lead ultimately to a reduction in civil servants' morale, whilst allowing for the potential perpetuation of out-dated schemes and programmes, or indeed processes which are inefficient or obsolete.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one also hears of anecdotes where some Ministries, close to the end of the fiscal year, should they be under-budget, go to great lengths to \"spend\" the balance, so that they will not have their budgets cut the following year.&nbsp; This is a real waste in itself and needs to be avoided.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the next&nbsp;FY 2005/06 Budget, I am therefore proposing that the Government conduct a zero based budget review <p align=left>Column: 630<p>across-the-board for all Ministries.&nbsp; The review should include a revisit of the mission, objectives, programmes and resource needs of all Ministries.&nbsp; The result should enable a streamlining of Government activities, including subsidies, social assistance programmes and schemes.&nbsp; It should also enable greater efficiency all round, if there is duplication across the Ministries for shared services.&nbsp; If there are indeed expenditures for programmes no longer required, they should be terminated, thus incurring further cost savings.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe the last time the MOF did a zero based budgeting exercise was many years ago.&nbsp; A zero based budget review exercise conducted this year and subsequently once every five years will serve to ensure that the public sector remains vigilant, efficient and relevant, and delivers targeted services in tune with the times.&nbsp; Who knows, the review might end up with a cut greater than the proposed 2% cut for the next fiscal year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a related matter, I would also like to propose that the Government also review its annual grants to statutory boards with a fine tooth-comb.&nbsp; The grant should be tied to a set of performance criteria and the level of accumulated surpluses, particularly where there is no more strategic use for the surplus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I recognise that the trimming of the Ministries' budget and a close check on Government expenses, if not properly managed, may create a morale problem among civil servants.&nbsp; Indeed, I believe that it is already happening, based on initial feedback I have gathered from my constituents and grassroots leaders.&nbsp; I want to ask whether the Government is ready to face this challenge and whether its personnel policies are geared to address this concern.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, in crafting Singapore's long-term competitive <p align=left>Column: 631<p>position, our public sector's size and role is significant.&nbsp; To be successful, we have to stay focused and be more efficient in delivering our public services, whilst realigning the expectations of future generations.&nbsp; We should not overlook inefficiencies in our public sector and continue to lay the platform for greater flexibility whilst maintaining fiscal prudence in the face of keener economic competition globally.&nbsp; Only in this way can we continue to ensure effective government in a land of opportunity for all.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Yes, we should look at what the Government's long-term goals are, examine their impact on our ordinary citizens and the implication on what lies ahead in the future.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As before, this Budget was delivered in flowery language with barrels of reasons and principles, but with no regard for the people's livelihood.&nbsp; And yet, concealed behind the vague and flowery language are many sparkling spectres. &nbsp; Let us examine what are the financial policies and fundamentals that are laid down by DPM Lee.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, DPM Lee said that in order to build an efficient government, he would cut by 2% the budget caps of all Ministries, except MINDEF, for this financial year, in order to reduce revenue shortfall and&nbsp; to attain a balanced budget in FY 2005.&nbsp; On the surface, reducing the Ministries' budgets and maintaining high efficiency appear to be reasonable.&nbsp; But, what would be the reaction of the various Government departments when their budgets are slashed?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 632<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To start with, the Ministry of National Development has already informed all the town councils that they would no longer support any HDB flat maintenance items which require heavy expenditure.&nbsp; This implies that the cost for town councils will be significantly increased.&nbsp; When the town councils can no longer afford such increases and start to run into deficit, would they not resort to raising the conservancy charges?&nbsp; Once the conservancy charges are increased, then the meagre rebates granted by the Government over the years will be wiped off.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The falling of one leaf heralds autumn.&nbsp; With this, who can guarantee that the other Government Ministries will not increase their charges in order to compensate for this cut in the budget allocation?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the&nbsp;2% cut be a catalyst for Government's productivity to go up?&nbsp; Or will it directly result in the Government departments turning to the ordinary citizens and increase their charges to bridge the gap?&nbsp; Will this also spark another round of business cost increase, resulting in our competitiveness being eroded?&nbsp; Let us wait and see.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's expenditure for FY 2003 amounted to 17% of the GDP, and it is the biggest consumer in our domestic market.&nbsp; Will this 2% reduction bring about a chain of reaction that would affect our economy?&nbsp;&nbsp; We know that this is a deficit budget, but the Government should also consider that the present economic recovery is not across the board, the unemployment rate is still&nbsp;high and the Government can well afford to use the surplus accumulated during its term to finance this deficit.&nbsp; Why is the Government in such a hurry to withdraw this 2% of expenditure (which amounted to about $450 million) from the economy now?&nbsp; Is it because that the Government suffered a setback in its investments last year, and that the NII was $1 billion short of the original forecast and it needed to<p align=left>Column: 633<p> make up for this loss?&nbsp; Can the Government explain why the NII on investments was 33% short of the original forecast?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, DPM Lee said that we should encourage our people to be self-reliant, to be responsible for their own living and to build up a strong society.&nbsp; To achieve this long-term goal, the fundamental of Government's fiscal policy is reducing the subsidy on university education and adopting means test to decide the amount of health care subsidy to each individual.&nbsp; The Government said that maintaining the current ratio of subsidy on tertiary education will result in a squeeze on the resources for the primary and secondary schools.&nbsp; It argued that&nbsp;university education will only benefit individual in securing employment and earn a higher income, whereas the secondary and primary education is more beneficial to the society as a whole.&nbsp; Therefore, the current formula in university subsidy should be reviewed.&nbsp; The reason of social benefit sounds grand, but behind it, it is simply the Government's unwillingness to continue to undertake the current subsidy of university fees for our people.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When defending its foreign talent policy, the Government says that foreign talents play a key role in our economic development.&nbsp; With them, we are able to strengthen our competitiveness to attract foreign investments, thus creating more job opportunities for our people.&nbsp; The Government has actually spent a lot of money and resources to attract foreign students.&nbsp; The Government, including statutory boards, spend public fund by providing them with tuition grants, bursaries and scholarships to study in our universities.&nbsp; The increase of foreign students in our universities has also brought about higher cost to the manpower, facilities and financial resources in our universities.&nbsp; Now when we need more taxpayers' money in <p align=left>Column: 634<p>developing our own talents, the Government turns around and says that university education only benefits individuals in securing better employability&nbsp;upon graduation and, as such, they should pay more fees.&nbsp; Could DPM Lee enlighten us what kind of logic is this?</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the Government saying that only foreign talents can bring benefits to our society and hence it is worth the while spending on them? &nbsp; For our own students, university education only benefit them as individuals, therefore they have to be laden with debts the moment they graduate and start paying back with an expected lowered starting salary.&nbsp; Is the Government saying that in our new knowledge-based economy, the role of our university graduates is only to secure higher salary for themselves?&nbsp; The Government's message is simple, that is,&nbsp; our local talent is not good enough.&nbsp; We need foreign talents.&nbsp; So, we could only cultivate foreign talents.&nbsp; As for our own people, if they want to be recognised as talent, either parents have to foot the bill or they will end up with a heavy debt after graduating from university.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DPM Lee also said that our social safety net must be carefully targeted and must not undermine our will to work and improve ourselves.&nbsp; As such, subsidies should be focused on those who need them most and in areas which yield the most public good.&nbsp; Means testing will, therefore, become an important feature in providing public services and social assistance.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, there is nothing wrong to encourage our people to be self-reliant and to make optimal use of our resources.&nbsp; But what is the Government's responsibility to the people?&nbsp; Should means testing be used as a norm to decide payment of basic public service is debatable.&nbsp; When the Government says that subsidies should focus on those who need them most, any person who has <p align=left>Column: 635<p>social justice at heart will generally accept this broad principle.&nbsp; However, judging from the PAP Government's governing style, I am afraid this is going to be another trick with the real motive concealed.&nbsp; &nbsp; The question is, who are those that most needed such subsidies? Are you saying that only those families whose income is less than $1,000 should be our focus, and those with $1,001 will not require the same level of assistance?&nbsp; No doubt, we do need to help the lower income people, but what about those who are unemployed and those whose assets have devalued and the \"new poor\" in the middle class who are squeezed?&nbsp; Do they not need the help too?&nbsp; Will the use of means testing to decide the medical subsidy not result in higher medical costs for most of the patients?&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is the case and the margin of increase is higher than the actual subsidies given to the needy, is the Government not benefiting from means testing?&nbsp; If this is in need either in short term or in long term, would it not extend the norm of means test to other public services such as education?&nbsp; Under the disguise of a broader objective of re-distributing public resources and building of a strong society, the middle-income group will be the ones who are squeezed most.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, what I would like to put to you is&nbsp;the fact that, regardless of whether the economy is good or bad, the burden of cost of living of our people in Singapore has never lessened, it has increased.&nbsp; When the times are good, the Government will say, \"Well, you can now afford it, so all the fees and charges will be increased!\"&nbsp;&nbsp; When the economy is bad, the Government will sit by and watch, and only step in when the people are in a state of extreme hardship.&nbsp; Even then, the support they give to the people is hardly sufficient in helping them to tide over the difficult times, and the Government even rubs salt into the people's wounds by <p align=left>Column: 636<p>emphasising how important it is to import foreign talents. &nbsp; Now our economy has yet to be fully recovered, but the Government is already in such a hurry to withdraw the various rebates and to plan for a new fiscal landscape.&nbsp; This budget has laid down the foundation of collecting more fees from the people by introducing means test in healthcare service and reviewing university subsidies in the name of building an efficient government and a strong society.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DPM Lee in closing his Budget speech said, \"Together, as one <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, we will build a future of opportunity for ourselves and our children.\"&nbsp; However, if the Government is to adopt such financial principles and fundamentals I described above, then the future of ourselves and our children will be one that is full of stress and heavily laden with the burden of life.&nbsp; They will be weighed down with the high cost of living and constantly struggling to live a life.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, how many people will have the courage to have more children?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t\t </span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I> :&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Hougang said the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance was giving a lot of reasons and principles on the macro economics but did not notice the changing trend that impacts our ordinary citizens. What is the current trend in the market? The current trend is one of outsourcing in the manufacturing sector. Many manufacturing industries in the developed countries are outsourcing many of their production to other low-cost countries. Even our <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> companies are outsourcing. Therefore, DPM's budget is targeted at addressing this trend.<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many people who are asking what care and concern this Budget gives to the ordinary people.&nbsp; In the past&nbsp;few years, we had given them a lot of rebates, reliefs and assistance.&nbsp; The main thing is that as leaders of a government, we <p align=left>Column: 637<p>should discern the mega trends.&nbsp; Unfortunately, although Mr Low and Mr Chiam &nbsp; have seen the main trends, they could offer no solution to help the people. &nbsp; Mr Chiam said that foreign investors had gone to other low cost countries.&nbsp; He did not tell us how to retain these companies in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Mr Low does not agree with our policy of attracting foreign talents.&nbsp; He seems to be jealous of the foreign talents.&nbsp; We believe that with foreign talents, we can attract foreign investors to come here to set up factories.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another trend is that of contract workers.&nbsp; Whether in the education field or &nbsp; in the financial sector, how do we protect our contract workers?&nbsp; This is most important.&nbsp; Because contract work has become a trend.&nbsp; One of my residents complained to me, &nbsp; \"Why&nbsp;can I only get contract work and not a permanent job?&nbsp; And the contract is renewable after three years.\"&nbsp; This is a trend, an inevitable trend.&nbsp; Another resident told me that he was lucky to get a three-year contract work, because \"no contract, no job\".&nbsp; So this is&nbsp;the trend!</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bigger trend is globalisation.&nbsp; The whole world is looking for talents.&nbsp; Therefore, we should try our best to attract foreign talents to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; We are competing with the other parts of the world for rare talents.&nbsp; They will help to contribute to our economy.&nbsp; At the same time, we have not neglected our local talents.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent S Pass issued by MOM is a good measure.&nbsp; But other people are afraid that this may deprive them of their jobs.&nbsp; In fact, the S Pass is given only to a special category of semi-skilled workers in the healthcare service, the pharmacists and nurses.&nbsp; Although we have highly talented people to handle the jobs at the higher plane, we still need other types of talents to cover some jobs in the middle and lower echelons. Although on the surface, it may appear that the issue of S <p align=left>Column: 638<p>passes&nbsp; may lead to more foreign workers coming in to compete for jobs with our locals, they actually help to fill the vacuum in our service industry. With these semi-skilled workers around, we may enhance the confidence of the potential investors, and tilt the balance in our favour when they decide which country to invest in, thus creating more jobs for our workers in the other areas.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must spare no efforts in establishing&nbsp;our creative industries.&nbsp; However, Mr Chiam said that our film industry cannot be developed because of our PAP Government's rigid regime, which has made the people docile.&nbsp; But, he offers no help to turn it around. The Indian film industry has been thriving because of its own particular background.&nbsp; We should understand what makes the Indian film industry so successful.&nbsp; In fact, the film industry in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is now taking off.&nbsp; Jack Neo has just produced a few movies and the last one, <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Home Run,</i> was particularly successful. One of the young actresses won a prestigious <I>Golden Horse</I> prize. I understand he is embarking on a new film called <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">The Best Bet.</i> I sincerely hope that&nbsp;he would win the best bet!</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, Mr Low has said that the Government departments are reducing their budgets and many people are concerned about it. I am concerned too.&nbsp; But I think we should first &nbsp; understand the motive behind this move.&nbsp; The Government, as a whole, is trying to reduce expenditure.&nbsp; Deputy Speaker, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, mentioned just now that she hoped the reduced budget would not result in the Government departments' efficiency being compromised. One resident told me recently that he used to cut his hair once in three weeks, and now he is cutting his hair once in four weeks.&nbsp; I said, \"Why don't you&nbsp;buy a pair of scissors and cut your hair yourself?&nbsp; Then you will save more.\"&nbsp; So, when the Government department has to cut its <p align=left>Column: 639<p>budget, it has to find other ways to improve productivity so that the same, if not more, work could be done. This must be the spirit.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me take Mustafa as an example.&nbsp; First of all, I must declare that I have nothing to do with Mustafa.&nbsp; I am not related to any of its owners.&nbsp; Recently, I visited <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and many people whom I met there told me that whenever they visited <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, they would go to Mustafa.&nbsp; Mustafa has become a very famous brand name.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their business philosophy is to be honest, do not cheat on customers, be humble and not arrogant.&nbsp; I visited Mustafa myself and I noticed that the&nbsp;jewellery&nbsp; and silverware department&nbsp; was open for business in the late hours of the night.&nbsp; The sales persons were very knowledgeable and polite.&nbsp; Just imagine, even in the middle of the night, they were still selling the gold ornaments.&nbsp; Not only Indians are patronising the store but many Singaporeans as well. They enjoy shopping in Mustafa because the prices are reasonable and the service is good.&nbsp; It does not mean that with a 2% cut in the budget&nbsp;the sky will fall down.&nbsp; They can still offer good and effective service if managed prudently.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 12pt\">In the past, people had said that Singaporeans are arrogant.&nbsp; But my conclusion is that&nbsp;Singaporeans are not arrogant.&nbsp; Many people said that because in the last few years <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> had progressed very well, the economy was well and they were all very proud of themselves.&nbsp; I think Singaporeans are simply confident of&nbsp; themselves. This is an important quality which we must maintain. MOM and WDA have put in a lot of efforts.&nbsp; Last year, in order to encourage the people to take up skills development and skills retraining, they went all out to promote the concept of re-skilling for better employability. &nbsp; We<p align=left>Column: 640<p> should change the mindsets of our people.&nbsp; This year, I do not know what would be MOM's new theme.&nbsp; I suggest they should use the theme of \"Let us show our best! \" &nbsp; So long as we are prepared to learn from the basics, improve ourselves, and promotion is waiting for those who have successfully completed their courses.\"</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because many citizens feel that the situation before us is hopeless, we must help them to clear this hurdle.&nbsp; We should impress on them that there is hope in skills training, so that they can look further ahead and keep moving on. &nbsp; Let me quote you one or two examples.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our economy, there are many things that our people do not understand.&nbsp; I read in the papers that now, many big companies in the west are outsourcing their call centre to <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but they do not want their clients to know that the call centre was operating from <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. In order to get these jobs in the call centres, many Indians are learning to speak better English and get rid of their Indian accent.&nbsp;Now many Indian ladies are working in the call centres, speaking impeccable English. They earn a lot of money, just as telephone operators, so much so that their parents are worried, thinking that their daughters were working as \"call girls\"!&nbsp; \"Why are&nbsp;they always working at night and earn such a lot of money?\"&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, they understand.&nbsp; They are all encouraging their daughters to learn and speak good English to get these lucrative jobs. This is a breakthrough!&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we want to develop our service industry, if we want to embrace the new economy, we must change our mindset.&nbsp; We should explain this new phenomenon to the ordinary citizens so that they would understand. Otherwise, they can have a lot of complaints, but no solution to the problem. As political leaders, we should look for the solution and help the people, rather than moaning over it. &nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 641<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DPM Lee has proposed this Budget under the present circumstances so that we would be prepared to face the future challenges, and that we could seize the opportunities that come with the new economy.&nbsp; We want to compete with <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>, with <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, with all the emerging economies.&nbsp; This would depend on our employers and our employees and, with our political leaders, we are all in the same boat.&nbsp; We should help one another.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

It is a budget of&nbsp;prudent spending that nevertheless offers us a bold vision of reinforcing Singapore's position as a vibrant hub for businesses and talents to come and seek their opportunities.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to touch on three groups of issues - the first is about the making of a vibrant hub, the second about prudent spending, and the third about some points of details in the Budget Statement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a recent business visit to Boston, I was sitting at a sidewalk cafe in the business district and decided to do a&nbsp;quick and rough survey of the people who walked past.&nbsp; On average, out of 10, I counted three whites, two blacks, three Asians (Chinese, Japanese or Korean, I could not tell), one Hispanic and one Indian.&nbsp; We are still some way to go before having that kind of mix that is prevalent in other major cosmopolitan cities of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as we open our doors to welcome talents of all races and as our people spread their wings to spend more time in foreign lands, we all believe we have to have a strong society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Building a strong society</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in making a strong society, Singaporeans must take pride in <p align=left>Column: 642<p>Singapore and what we stand for, that is, our national policies.&nbsp; Travellers to Australia and New Zealand will tell you that these two countries are very particular in controlling the importation of foodstuff and organic matter.&nbsp; Golfers will know that, on arrival, their golf shoes must be clean without traces of organic matter, plant or soil matter.&nbsp; And, the authorities can be very pedantic about this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scandinavia has very low limits and stiff penalties for drink driving.&nbsp; When the Scandinavians go out for dinner, one will be rostered to be the driver for the night.&nbsp; He or she will abstain from consuming any alcohol and has to stay sober the whole night in order to drive his friends home safely.&nbsp; In some places in Australia, I am told that, when stopped at police road blocks, suspected drink drivers who are just below the legal limit, are made to sit by the roadside under a banner that reads \"Drinking and Driving?&nbsp; You must be an idiot!\" for half an hour until they sober up.&nbsp; Other passing motorists can then see who these \"idiots\" are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you criticise any of these policies in the presence of the average Scandinavian, Australian or New Zealander, he or she will define it to the bone and explain why such policy is necessary.&nbsp; This stems from their firm belief that the stance taken by their society is for the good of their&nbsp;&nbsp;society.&nbsp; Or, they may just be defending their country against the criticism of a foreigner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we Singaporeans say when we are called upon to defend our policies?&nbsp; Take the world-renowned Singaporean ban on chewing gum.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans, when asked by foreigners about this policy, cringe in embarrassment.&nbsp; Do they see these policies as being imposed by the Government or do they see them as being for the common good?&nbsp; Ask my daughter about her experience.&nbsp; Recently,<p align=left>Column: 643<p> we came back by coach from a church camp in Malaysia.&nbsp; On the way back, she bought some confectioneries and these were in a thin transparent pink-coloured plastic bag.&nbsp; When this bag of her goodies went through our Customs or security checks at Tuas, the officer noticed the contents of the bag and unilaterally, without notifying her confiscated two tubes of Hi-Chew.&nbsp; Now, if you do not know, let me tell you that Hi-Chew is not chewing gum.&nbsp; It is actually a chewy pastille that dissolves totally in&nbsp;your mouth.&nbsp; My daughter was totally upset.&nbsp; First, the&nbsp; officer was poor in his product knowledge and, second, he was high-handed in confiscating the Hi-Chew without informing her.&nbsp; You can imagine what she will say the next time someone brings up the subject of our chewing gum ban.&nbsp; In the meantime, I am working on her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can we motivate our people to believe wholeheartedly and passionately in what we stand for?&nbsp; Singaporeans are law-abiding in nature and will obey new policies that are set.&nbsp; However, convincing them of the reasons behind each policy is a challenge that each Government department must be mindful of.&nbsp; It will require education, careful listening and addressing of feedback via multiple channels, much patience and relentless perseverance, and sensitive enforcement to convince them that the policies are not without meaning nor purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Vibrant society - Danger of being regarded as a mediocre city</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week, I flew to Beijing and back.&nbsp; On arrival at Beijing Airport, I was one of the first few coming off the plane and saw a row of five Chinese girls waiting to receive their foreign guests.&nbsp; This is the airport's visitor receiving service; nothing<p align=left>Column: 644<p> special.&nbsp; They were elegantly dressed, in dark green cheongsam with gold embroidery, with their hair tied back.&nbsp; Each of them held a small placard with the name of the visitor being received neatly printed on the placard.&nbsp; A Caucasian man in front of me indicated he was one of those being received.&nbsp; The girl stepped forward and in polished English said, \"Welcome to <st1:City><st1:place>Beijing</st1:place></st1:City>, Mr Hopkins.\"&nbsp; On my return to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>, when I arrived at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Changi</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Airport</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, I would not say anything more.&nbsp; You should take a look for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her business jacket was a size or two too big and the visitor's name was scribbled with a marker pen on the whiteboard placard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, the vibrancy of our city is not judged by this alone.&nbsp; But a common complaint by Singaporeans is that there is little to do in terms of leisure in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; One Friday morning, I was listening to FM98.7 in the car while sending my children to school.&nbsp; Daniel Ong, the DJ, asked one male listener, \"What are you going to do this weekend?\"&nbsp; The listener replied, \"Catch a movie.\"&nbsp; Daniel Ong then remarked, \"How come every time&nbsp;I ask my listeners what they are going to do, they say catch a movie?&nbsp; Is there anything else to do?\"&nbsp; After a pause, the listener replied sheepishly, \"No.&nbsp; There isn't anything else to do.\"&nbsp; Daniel Ong replied, \"Ya, there isn't anything else better to do in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, is <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> as bland as some make it out to be?&nbsp; This cannot be true.&nbsp; One only has to visit <st1:Street><st1:address>East Coast Parkway</st1:address></st1:Street> during the weekends.&nbsp; There, cyclists, young and old, are breezing up and down the cycling pathways which are full of roller-bladers whizzing past, watched in fascination by families who have set up tents of all sizes and all degrees of sophistication.&nbsp; A quick informal survey has revealed activities as diverse as radio-controlled model aeroplane flying, fishing, sailing, football and tae-kwondo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 645<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about leisure activities for those who prefer to stay indoors?&nbsp; Besides our state-of-the-art movie theatres for movie-goers, there are people who indulge in all kinds of sports, cooking, bowling, dancing, karaoke, folk art, pottery, just to name a few.&nbsp; At the Esplanade, we may be treated to art exhibitions, concerts, dance performances and theatrical events.&nbsp; How come there are still Singaporeans who have nothing else better to do during the weekends, than to catch a movie?&nbsp;&nbsp;And, who&nbsp;laments that there is much to do in other countries?&nbsp; Perhaps, it is just that the grass on the other side of the fence is greener, or perhaps there is not enough information and publicity, giving Singaporeans ideas on how to have fun and enjoy life, or perhaps we are just plain lazy and just want to crash out and do nothing.&nbsp; We should wipe out our dowdy image of a nation and a people obsessed with only economic success.&nbsp; The goal should be for every Singaporean to work hard, work smart, play hard and have fun.&nbsp; As the Nobel Prize winner in Literature in 1911, Mr Maurice Maeterlinck said, \"Tell me how a people uses its leisure and I will tell you the quality of its civilisation.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Self-reliant society</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on self-reliant society.&nbsp; As we continue to develop into a modern vibrant society, we should move away from relying on the authorities to handle everything.&nbsp; One example can be found in our neighbourhood environment.&nbsp; As our HDB residents live in close proximity to each other, there will inevitably be minor disputes between neighbours over such day-to-day matters as dripping mops, curry being thrown out of the window, noise irritation and things cluttering up the common corridors.&nbsp; Such cases are on the rise and residents look to the relevant authority, the town council or HDB, for redress and enforcement of regulations.&nbsp; This situation is far from satisfactory.&nbsp; Instead of having to seek the intervention of the town council or HDB every time a <p align=left>Column: 646<p>dispute arises, we should allow more autonomy and self-determination at the local level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to foster a sense of belonging to the community and to encourage autonomy, the residents should be given some authority to make rules on local issues by majority decision, such as whether to censure the particular resident for behaving unreasonably.&nbsp; In the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the management committee of the apartment building can stipulate, for example, whether babies or young children should be discouraged in the building or they can prohibit flushing of toilets in the middle of the night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Prudent spending - Living within our means</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, next, I would like to touch on the second group of issues centering on prudent spending.&nbsp; On living within our means and HDB upgrading programmes, the HDB upgrading programme was launched during the years of plenty when we enjoyed strong growth, rising property prices and budget surpluses.&nbsp; Now, we have to tighten our belts and cut back on non-productive expenditure, and sensibly so.&nbsp; We have to live within our means.&nbsp; In every housing estate, you will find some precincts that were fortunate to be selected at that time and did in fact undergo upgrading, be it main upgrading, interim upgrading or lift upgrading.&nbsp; By contrast, just a stone's throw away, the next precinct that is not so fortunate is still standing forlornly waiting for its turn.&nbsp; Its residents are looking wistfully across the road, watching with envy their neighbours who are enjoying lifts that stop at every floor and upgraded common areas, and asking when it will be their turn.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the country, there are many precincts and blocks of flats that have not been upgraded.&nbsp; Realistically, are we able to upgrade them all, and over what<p align=left>Column: 647<p> timeframe?&nbsp; What is the capital expenditure required?&nbsp; If our resources will be better deployed to fund other priority projects, I think we should start re-orientating the expectations of our residents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Restructuring for affected Singaporeans</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a related issue on restructuring for affected Singaporeans and what I call the four-roomer's problem, we went through a period of high growth with escalating property prices.&nbsp; Now, we are faced with structural unemployment where some jobs may never return.&nbsp; There are those who had geared too highly during the boom years and bought properties that are now beyond their means.&nbsp; Their income has been slashed; some with income so low that they cannot even meet their daily household needs.&nbsp; The cost of living remains high and they have accumulated arrears in HDB loan repayment, electricity bills, SC&amp;CC, school fees, etc.&nbsp; Although there is the need to retrain and upgrade their skills, some simply cannot get out of the rut.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are we doing to help them?&nbsp; We are offering small hesitant measures of help - restructure their HDB loans for a few months, short-term financial assistance, subsidies for school fees, for fear that if we are too generous, more and more people will choose the easier option, leading us down the slippery slope to become a welfare state with an over-reliant population.&nbsp; But these small measures are unlikely to solve their problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their main problem is housing.&nbsp; They had made a major mistake and bought too big a flat which they cannot now afford due to their changed circumstances.&nbsp; They need to downgrade to a smaller more affordable flat.&nbsp; Even if they want to sell at the present market value, they will<p align=left>Column: 648<p> not get much back after repaying the loan.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

When it comes to means testing, they tend to fail.&nbsp; Once the assessor sees \"4-room\" as the room type, their application for subsidy is put on one side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, realistically, what can they do to get out of this rut?&nbsp; Can we help them to downgrade, wipe their slates clean, lighten their burden, so that they can start afresh and move on?&nbsp; We can do this as a one-off exercise to apply these measures to clear the historical cases, and are not applicable to new cases if we fear that more people will fall into this group&nbsp;and be reckless in making property purchases in future, thinking that the Government will always bail them out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like to comment on some of the issues DPM spoke about in the Budget Statement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Procreation - next generation of Singaporeans</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Members before me have spoken about more babies to be the next generation of Singaporeans.&nbsp; I would like to also touch on this issue.&nbsp; The declining birth rate has been discussed, debated and deliberated upon for a long time not just in the Government but also among the public.&nbsp; Not replacing ourselves is a serious problem not just for the country but also the individual families.&nbsp; Although we cannot over-emphasise the effects of the declining birth rate on our nation as a whole, we must also consider its negative effects on individuals and the family unit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To illustrate, let me tell you about a documentary I once saw&nbsp;on China Television about China's one-child policy.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 649<p>China, as we know, has the reverse problem of controlling her population, but the consequence of having only one child is similar in all countries.&nbsp; In one segment of the programme, a young woman in her 20s was interviewed.&nbsp; She said she had just started working and earning an income.&nbsp; Being an only child, she has to support two parents and four aging grandparents, ie, parents of her parents.&nbsp; If she married, her husband would probably be from a one-child family.&nbsp; Hence, the two of them would have to support not only themselves but four parents and eight grandparents, and a baby, if they were to have a child of their own.&nbsp; She said she was very depressed by the thought of that prospect.&nbsp; This has serious financial implications on the young family and the state.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Enhancing competition: Power industry</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on enhancing competition and the power industry.&nbsp; Business people have been lamenting about our high electricity charges that add to the high cost of doing business in Singapore.&nbsp; We rely on imported fuel oil and natural gas to generate electricity, and the prices of these commodities are beyond our control.&nbsp; We do not have cheap domestic sources of coal or oil, nor large rivers to tap hydro-electricity, nor nuclear power stations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, since the introduction of vesting contract on 1st January 2004 based on 65% of the system demand being allocated to the four generation companies, the vesting price for the month of January 2004 was $94.24 per megawatt hour (MWh) and the average pool clearing price was $66 per MWh.&nbsp; The wholesale price of electricity, which is the weighted average of the vesting price and the pool price, had therefore fallen.&nbsp; But given the high capital costs of the power plant and equipment, and the intrinsic costs of running and maintaining a power station, is such a low wholesale <p align=left>Column: 650<p>price sustainable over the longer term?&nbsp; Should the consumers be overjoyed and can they now revise their financial budgets with the expectation of lower charges for their electricity?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the large commercial and industrial contestable customers, including many of our SMEs, which had embraced retail market liberalisation, exercised choice and elected to be supplied by independent retailers were surprised to see their electricity bills in January.&nbsp; Under the new electricity market rules and the contract they entered into with their retailers, payments for any excess volume under the vesting contract will be charged to them.&nbsp; For the month of January, they ended up bearing an additional 12% on their bills.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under our market settlement rules, the extra payment that these contestable customers have to bear is paid to the generation companies.&nbsp; The largest beneficiaries are the three large Temasek-owned gencos, one of them being Senoko, of which I am an external director.&nbsp; But, in the longer term interest of our new electricity market, we are not overjoyed by this extra profit.&nbsp; In fact, there are some industry concerns that the Government is trying to increase the profits of these gencos so that Temasek could get a better price for their divestment.&nbsp; Sir, such speculation is detrimental not only to Temasek's divestment efforts but also to the good reputation of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Foreign-sourced income</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next point is on foreign-sourced income.&nbsp; It is a good move that we are exempting individuals' foreign-sourced income.&nbsp; Any money kept outside Singapore will not benefit Singapore.&nbsp; Any money brought in, whether to invest in stocks and shares or to spend on a BMW, will contribute to our economy and bring about other benefits, direct or indirect,<p align=left>Column: 651<p> whether in the form of vehicle taxes or adding more liquidity to our capital markets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage the in-flow of this offshore money hitherto kept overseas, our rules have to be clear as to what is regarded as income earned in Singapore and, hence, subject to tax.&nbsp; Otherwise, there will always be the fear that a few years after the offshore income is brought in, the tax authorities may question whether it was in fact earned in Singapore.&nbsp; Such a risk would discourage people from bringing in their foreign-sourced income.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Tax exemption for new companies</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next point relates to tax exemption for new companies.&nbsp; When we allow full exemption from tax for the first $100,000 of normal chargeable income, excluding Singapore dividends, for each of the first three years of assessment within YA 2005 to YA 2009, we should be mindful of the risk of abuse.&nbsp; In other countries where such \"3-year tax free and 2-year half tax\" exemption is available, businessmen have been quick to incorporate new companies to park their profits for the three years and, towards the end of the 3-year period, set up other new companies and divert profits to these newly set up companies to continue to enjoy the tax exemption.&nbsp; Once the older companies have exhausted their 3-year exemption, they are then wound up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Withholding tax on royalty payments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last point relates to withholding tax on royalty payments.&nbsp; I fully agree that exploiting new knowledge and ideas is important for Singapore companies to compete internationally.&nbsp; But why limit ourselves to using other people's ideas and intellectual property?&nbsp; We should be bolder still and more optimistic about<p align=left>Column: 652<p> Singapore-based companies' abilities to generate new ideas, and plan for the situation where Singapore companies will own and hold their own IPs, and other companies from other countries have to pay royalties to our Singapore IP owners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, such royalty payments are subject to withholding tax in the country of the payer and are also taxed as income when the royalties are received or brought into Singapore.&nbsp; This has forced many companies to engage creative tax advisers to park their IPs in tax haven countries and keep their royalty proceeds offshore.&nbsp; This is not healthy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should, therefore, have measures to encourage both Singapore homegrown companies and foreign companies that choose to use Singapore as their IP centre to own, hold and register their IPs in Singapore, thereby bringing revenue into our country.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I support the motion.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp;

Debate resumed.</P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr David T E Lim (Holland-Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr David T E Lim (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</B> Mr Speaker, if I may, I would like to approach this debate from a slightly different point of view to talk about some of the emotional aspects of policy-making.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 653<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in our nation's next phase of development, we will need to harness everyone's&nbsp;economic contributions -&nbsp;from student to entrepreneur, from policy maker to homemaker.&nbsp; To do this, we must make sure that our economic policies are right; and the provisions in this year's budget move us in that right direction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp;to overcome the challenges we face, we need more than just the right, rational policies.&nbsp; We also need the emotional buy-in from everyone so that these policies can be effective.&nbsp; Take, for example, a topical subject that has come up several times today and will come up again,&nbsp;that is,&nbsp;about making babies and&nbsp;raising children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Many good ideas have been raised about how to increase the number of babies born each year.&nbsp; But the fundamental and most important question to address is whether young adult Singaporeans want babies.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we want to look for reasons today why young couples do&nbsp;not want babies, there are many.&nbsp; Essentially, they boil down to cost, time and lifestyles.&nbsp; But how do we counter these reasons?&nbsp; Logic will not.&nbsp; Incentives cannot.&nbsp; &nbsp;But emotions can.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incentives can raise birth rates, at least temporarily as our own experience has shown.&nbsp; But at best, incentives can only make it easier for parents to have babies, and lower the cost of raising children.&nbsp; And at worst, more and more incentives may leave young couples with the idea that children are a burden, and not a joy.&nbsp; So I agree with Mr Tan Soo Khoon that the only compelling reason why we should bear with the pain, and the cost, and the inconvenience of having babies is the joy they bring.&nbsp; This is an emotional motive, not an economic rationale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my children were young, my happiest moment was when I&nbsp;came home<p align=left>Column: 654<p> from work, they were there, rushing to the&nbsp;door to greet me.&nbsp; Now as they grow up, my greatest joy is to see them mature - to see how they have become kind and sensitive in dealing with people, how they are confident of themselves, how they are able to argue&nbsp;perceptively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if we see babies as another claim on time, or an addition to costs, or an interference with lifestyles, then we will clamour for more and more incentives, and still they would not be enough.&nbsp; But if we truly believe in the joy of children, then incentives help, but should no longer matter the most.&nbsp; But even if we believe that we should have children because they bring us joy, there is a second&nbsp;consideration.&nbsp; And that is whether we believe that we can give our children joy.&nbsp; If we are honest with ourselves, the answer to this question depends on whether we are ourselves happy with our lives.&nbsp; If we are, then we can believe that our children will also have happy lives.&nbsp; But if we believe that life is getting harder, rather&nbsp;than better, then we would not think that our children's lives&nbsp;could be happier. These are fundamental questions of belief that each person must decide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures we are putting in place to restructure our economy are sensible and will make us stronger and more able to compete in the years ahead.&nbsp; We have the skills, and systems and institutions to do many and great things, if we believe in them.&nbsp; But we will achieve far less than our potential if our emotions are not right, and our heart is not in what we do.&nbsp; It is not just about making babies.&nbsp; But it extends to every area of public policy and governance.&nbsp; Our students need to feel that learning is a joy, not a subject to be passed, or a drudgery to be endured.&nbsp; Our entrepreneurs need to feel that they are heroes and not left-behinds, and be motivated by this feeling to attempt great things.&nbsp; We need a civil and a civic society, where people believe that this is where their heart and home is.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 655<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such outcomes are helped by the right economic policies.&nbsp; But we also need to develop our emotions as a nation.&nbsp; We can achieve this by factoring in&nbsp;practical measures to uplift emotions in our policies.&nbsp; These need not necessarily be big, radical policy shifts for now, but rather sensible adjustments to our existing robust frameworks.&nbsp; We could encourage babies, for example, by the Government moving quickly to a five-day workweek, and building more family oriented infrastructure for weekends, so that we can enjoy our children, and our children can be happy and enjoy our company.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important need we have today as a nation is to nurture the heart of our people.&nbsp; We can do this by using the money and the resources we have set aside in this budget in practical ways that uplift our emotions and human spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Budget.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr S Iswaran (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr S Iswaran (West Coast):</B> Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, thank&nbsp;you for allowing me to join in this debate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I rise in support of the Budget for FY04. To me, this Budget is significant not so much for its specific announcements on expenditure and taxation policies, but more on the Finance Minister's outline of some core fiscal policies which will underpin the Government's public finance approach going forward in its stage of new development and competition that Singapore will face. In the course of the next few minutes, I hope to address some of those underlying principles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a recent report by a Morgan Stanley economist was headlined, \"The FY 2004 Budget - extreme conservatism is puzzling\".&nbsp; I can understand that analyst's puzzle if you will, because he compares the surpluses that the <p align=left>Column: 656<p>Government has accumulated over a period of growth to the deficits that it has run in the last three or so years, and draws the conclusion that the Government can spend more from its reserves and other sources in order to create more of a domestic economy. Some data that have been cited include the average surplus for the period FY1993 to FY2003, has been&nbsp;in the order of magnitude of about 13% of GDP for 2004, compared to the average deficit for the period FY2001 to FY2004 which is about 3.5% of 2004 GDP.&nbsp; Put in another way, accumulated surplus was in the order of magnitude of about $130 billion, whereas the deficit was only in the order of magnitude of about $6 billion.&nbsp; So why can the Government not&nbsp;spend more?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think there is some sympathy for that perspective both within&nbsp;this House&nbsp;and also in the general economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister himself has made an eloquent case as to why fiscal prudence has been&nbsp;the hallmark of this Government.&nbsp; He has stressed the sound public finances which underpin Singapore's economic growth and resilience.&nbsp; He has also highlighted the Government's willingness, in&nbsp;a sense, to have temporary deficits, as it has been the case in the last few years, without falling into the trap of permanent structural deficits.&nbsp; These are sound principles which I fully support.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are going to become even more important, especially the aspect of maintaining balanced budgets in an environment where competition is going to get more intense, having downward impact and pressure on the Government's revenue whilst expenditure needs are going to continously increase with an aging population and other social needs in the country.&nbsp; Is a $0.7 billion deficit, which is about 0.4% of GDP 2004,&nbsp;extreme conservatism or is it a cautious first step with additional spending due with procreation-oriented measures and other policies that will be unfolding in the course of the year?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 657<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My own view is that it is better to be cautious.&nbsp; But I would like to hear the Finance Minister's elaboration on the Government's policy of fiscal prudence, and especially in managing it at a time when the economy is at the turning point and rising for growth.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Finance Minister's outline of the policy on building a strong society, there were a few key themes which ran through all aspects that he addressed - education, healthcare, building the next generation and also on the aspect of saving for retirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought one of the key themes was the balance between the State and the individual in taking responsibility for one's own affairs. We are at an important juncture where there has been a great deal of presumptions on the part of many Singaporeans where the State will intervene, and intervene in many cases quite quickly, in order to look after their interests.&nbsp; In an environment which imposes greater onus on the individual, not just take responsibility for himself, but also in terms of going out and creating wealth and opportunities in our country and beyond, that model is not relevant.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp;we must expect that the centre of gravity must shift&nbsp;from the State to the individual, not precipitously, but in gradual measured steps, but certainly the direction must be clear.&nbsp; I think that has become quite evident in the slew of underlying principles that the Finance Minister has announced in the course of this Budget debate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second aspect is where does State funding go?&nbsp; The key point is that State funding should go where there is greatest benefit for Singapore as a whole.&nbsp; In economic terms, it will be called the positive externality, meaning there are benefits that go beyond just the individuals, but to society in general.&nbsp; A good example of that is primary and secondary education and basic healthcare.&nbsp; Continued expenditure in this area and even increasing&nbsp;expenditure in this area is <p align=left>Column: 658<p>an important plank for the Government in its future policies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third theme that ran through is helping those who are in greatest need.&nbsp; Hence, the discussion on the healthcare system and, in particular, means testing to decide whether and how much an individual should be entitled to in terms of subsidies from the Government.&nbsp; These are all sound underlying principles to achieve social equity and economic efficiency in public finance.&nbsp; But there are a few key concerns that I have because we are managing&nbsp;a transition from an economy in&nbsp;a high-growth phase with Government playing a very dominant role to an economy in a more challenging&nbsp;phase, and Government empowering individuals and corporations more to chart their destiny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that context, one key element in all this change must be the preservation of choice.&nbsp; Singaporeans must be free to choose.&nbsp; If we take healthcare as an example, what level of healthcare do&nbsp;they want so that they can decide on how to spend their dollar?&nbsp; Whether it is full cost, private, \"A\" class in our Government hospitals or subsidised healthcare at \"C\" class or some intermediate arrangement, all these options must be available to Singaporeans.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;they can make rational choices as to how they want to allocate their budgets.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>In that context, I was quite heartened to hear that the Government will ensure that even the well-off can use C-class wards or will access to C-class wards, although they may not perhaps enjoy the same level of subsidy.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second dimension is providing support.&nbsp; When we make changes of this nature, asking individuals to take more ownership and responsibility, it is inevitable that some will fall through the cracks, and this is not because of any lack of trying or ill-intent on their part.&nbsp; It could just be the result of the <p align=left>Column: 659<p>circumstances that they find themselves in.&nbsp; It is important, for example, in the context of university education, that we have adequate measures in place to help those who are going to have difficulties meeting their financial obligations, especially if they have to bear a higher portion of the cost.&nbsp; We have talked a lot about loans and bursaries.&nbsp; But for a young university student, at the age of, say, 20-21, taking out a loan, even if it is for a few tens of thousands of dollars, is a huge ball and chain around his or her neck and it can affect morale and perhaps even the choice of whether to go ahead with tertiary education.&nbsp; The question is whether there are alternatives we can examine.&nbsp; And what I would like to ask the Government to consider is the model that the Australians have adopted, which is to impose a tertiary tax on those who go through the university system so that for a period of time after they have graduated and when their earnings are about&nbsp;certain levels, they will pay a tax until they are deemed to have fulfilled their own financial obligation to the university education that they received.&nbsp; That might achieve the twin objectives of, on the one hand, imposing greater financial ownership on individuals for their tertiary education and, at the same time not over-burdening the individual student, psychologically or financially, at the very outset of his or her tertiary education.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third aspect, Sir, I would like to highlight is, keeping it simple and fair.&nbsp; We have a system which is quite complex.&nbsp; Buying a car in Singapore involves, for some people, quite complex econometric modelling - trying to anticipate COE prices, their movements, and how various Government policies will have an impact on these.&nbsp; And, really these are very simple choices we should be allowed to make in our daily lives.&nbsp; From that context, when we talk about the means test, it should also be simple, <p align=left>Column: 660<p> but fair.&nbsp; What do I mean by that?&nbsp; When we consider some of the past Government assistance measures that have come in place, like CPF top-ups and so on, we have used housing type as the proxy for one's economic well-being and so the smaller your housing type, the greater the top-up you receive, or no top-up depending on how high the housing type is.&nbsp; That is at best a crude measure and certainly when we are looking at it in the context of things like healthcare we should be very careful how we administer such criteria.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, I would say that we should not be looking just at assets, we should be looking at flows of income that people have, in deciding what category they fall into in terms of&nbsp;socio-economic groups.&nbsp; A good example would be older generation Singaporeans who might be living in landed property, but old landed property in some of the older estates in Singapore.&nbsp; For these individuals, to make an argument that they are asset rich and they could also sell their house and pay for their medical cost - economically rational, but I think socially quite difficult to communicate and convince people.&nbsp; So I would say that we need to strike a balance between the two, not totally disregard one's asset holdings, but find the way to strike a balance between that and the real income flows that individuals have, so that whatever means test we ultimately administer, will be seen as one that is fair.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if I can just move to the point on building the next generation and procreation policies.&nbsp; By outlining the Government's thinking on some underlying principles, but leaving out the details or specifics for later, the Finance Minister has, in the manner of speaking, left us all with a pregnant pause.&nbsp; Fortunately, we only have to wait&nbsp;six months, till August, not the usual nine months, before the delivery of the full package.&nbsp; But, Sir, I fully support the<p align=left>Column: 661<p> principle that the Finance Minister has underlined and, in particular, the policy of aiming to produce the next generation of Singaporeans is vital because ultimately the thing will serve us not so well to have generated a whole group of young generation Singaporeans unless they have a deep commitment to this country and our future, which is collectively held.&nbsp; But I do have some thoughts on what can be done in this respect.&nbsp; Mr David Lim said that it is an emotional, not an economic issue.&nbsp; I agree.&nbsp; But this is the Budget, and since we are talking about dollars and cents, let me just share with you a quick back of the envelope calculation.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If our procreation policy is able to generate 5,000 more births a year, and each of these children goes on to contribute to the economy at the average GDP per capita, let us say, S$20,000 a year, that is quite conservative, in fact, the number is higher.&nbsp; And, let us say their working life is 30 years, a quick ballpark calculation, that cohort would contribute something like S$3 billion to our economy over a 30-year life-span.&nbsp; I think this is a conservative number.&nbsp; So investing about 10-15% of that future benefit in a generation of young Singaporeans today is not bad mathematics and I would, therefore, urge the Finance Minister to give the Minister-in-charge maximum latitude to exercise his discretion in this respect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite apart from the future benefits, the other point to note is spending in this particular sector is likely to be more domestically oriented because a lot of services&nbsp;are generated within the economy here.&nbsp; So the multiplier for the local economy is also likely to be far greater than in some other fiscal policies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where should the money be spent?&nbsp; First, a plea.&nbsp; Please do not distinguish between the first, second or third child.&nbsp; Neither should the parents of children of <p align=left>Column: 662<p>multiple births be penalised.&nbsp; Every child is precious, not just to the parents, but to all of us.&nbsp; For the parents, each additional child adds to their responsibilities and challenges, almost exponentially.&nbsp; I speak from very recent personal experience when I just have my third child.&nbsp; And, whoever coined the&nbsp;phrase, \"sleeping like a baby\", clearly had no idea what he is&nbsp;talking about.&nbsp; So what more when you have multiple births!&nbsp; When they have&nbsp;two or&nbsp;three children of the same age, demanding their attention, I think we should empathise with those parents and make it easier for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another point is whatever policies we announce in August at National Day, I would hope that we can backdate those policies so that we do not penalise the people who act in good faith and respond to the Government's plea today.&nbsp; I think we should also spend where it counts.&nbsp; Spending in the early months after a child is born is probably the most challenging.&nbsp; Whether&nbsp;the father or mother, they would all agree with this readily.&nbsp; So, if we can help out in terms of whether it is maternity leave, which is fully covered, or paternity leave, and also the infant and childcare elements, I think all of these should be considered quite seriously.&nbsp; But I would just like to make one comment on this point of maternity leave.&nbsp; I have heard in different feedback from some employers in terms of their attitudes towards employing women, if&nbsp;maternity leave of up to 6 months is contemplated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of this is borne out of ignorance, not understanding the overall needs of their workers and the community in general, but we cannot leave it as a fiscal incentive, we must work with the employers to educate them, to help them understand why such policies are not just in the national interest, but ultimately even for them as an employer, their ability to attract good people to come and work for them and to have workers who are motivated and productive, these measures would help them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 663<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So on that note, Sir, I would like to support the Budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</B> Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to make just three points.&nbsp; First, maintaining the competitiveness of the economy.&nbsp; Many speakers before me have raised the question of the high cost of our economy and I share their concerns because when I speak to the businessmen in my constituency, most of them raise the question that it is too expensive for them to do business.&nbsp; Sir, we have addressed wage competitiveness but, here again, it is not just reducing wages <I>per se</I> but rather making wages flexible to be able to respond to changing competition and also to relate wages to performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should pay our workers what is due to them based on their performance and based on their productivity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, land cost has been one of the unhappy points.&nbsp; Our policy is to value land based on opportunity cost.&nbsp; There was the suggestion that perhaps we should value land for industry based on what is the competition, that means the value that is being accorded to similar land in countries which we are competing with.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what are the implications we should look at them.&nbsp;Land cost, rentals, utilities, Government charges, these add to the cost of doing business and we should address them as we address wage competitiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the flexible wage system, in the unionised sector, NTUC and the unions have been explaining to their members and workers what is the impact, why this is necessary and also how this should be implemented.&nbsp; Trust and confidence is the critical factor.&nbsp; In the non-unionised sector, employees are very<p align=left>Column: 664<p> concerned because they do not have a voice that represents them.&nbsp; I told them that they could if they are general branch members, seek advice from the unions.&nbsp; I am sure the unions would give them the advice, or they should go to the Ministry of Manpower in case they have problems with the employers, but still I think many of them are concerned that employers may take advantage of them since they have no one to represent them and, therefore, they fear the impact of the flexible wage system.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have helped to explain to them that we must be competitive or otherwise they will have no jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next issue, Sir, is the employment opportunities for older workers.&nbsp; Sir, in the CDCs we have our job plus centres where we help workers who are retrenched, looking for jobs,&nbsp;who come to us.&nbsp; For the younger workers, our matching rate, our placement rate, is pretty high, but for older workers, even those with relevant skills and experience, it is tough going.&nbsp; So I hope the Government could look into this.&nbsp; Can the Government provide more incentives for companies to encourage them to employ older, mature workers?&nbsp; Some of them have experience; they have skills and we should not put their skills&nbsp;to waste.&nbsp; I know there&nbsp;is the People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme&nbsp;that&nbsp;gives certain sums of money to companies to cover wages of the older workers.&nbsp; Maybe more schemes like this would be useful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, let me touch on the next generation, the procreation programmes and activities.&nbsp; Sir, in my father's generation, the social expectation was to have large families.&nbsp; So my family has&nbsp;eight children.&nbsp; My peers, most of them have four or&nbsp;five brothers and sisters in their family.&nbsp; When it came to my time the message was \"Two is enough\".&nbsp; I did not believe it, so I have three.&nbsp; I was speaking to my Mayor colleagues and&nbsp;most of them have three. &nbsp;Mayor Zainul is the most <p align=left>Column: 665<p>hardworking, he has four.&nbsp; Mayor Yu-Foo has three, Mayor Teo has three.&nbsp; Only Mayor Heng has one.&nbsp; But I think he is young enough.&nbsp; I&nbsp;asked&nbsp; him just now if he would mind if I mention that he has one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>He said, \"Well, there are lots of reasons why I have only one.\"&nbsp; I will leave it to him to explain.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is a fundamental issue.&nbsp; I believe in having three because the larger the family, the happier the family.&nbsp; Because brothers and sisters have companions within the family.&nbsp; They fight, but they also joke together, and they find life a bit more interesting.&nbsp; If they have a problem, sometimes they consult their parents but they also consult their brothers and sisters.&nbsp; I get to know more of what my children are doing by talking to my children.&nbsp; Sometimes they talk to members outside the family.&nbsp; This may create some problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think three is a good number.&nbsp; Some may want to have more.&nbsp; The next message is, \"Three or more if you can afford them\".&nbsp; I agree that we must have the ability to afford more than three, not only the cost but also the time&nbsp;we spend with them because&nbsp;we want to make sure that they have the best that&nbsp;we can offer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people have fed back to me that the message is not quite clear enough.&nbsp; Why is it three or more if you can afford them?&nbsp; After all, for the next generation,&nbsp;80% of our students&nbsp;will go&nbsp;to the polytechnic and&nbsp;universities or have tertiary education.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that they would be able to afford if they want more than three, provided they can give their time to the children.&nbsp; So, the signal which the Government gives to the population is important.&nbsp; It is more a social issue than an economic issue.&nbsp; It is fundamental.&nbsp; It is emotional, as Mr David Lim has said.&nbsp; But I think that Mr Lim Hng Kiang's committee will look at all the things that are necessary&nbsp; -&nbsp; pro-family enterprises, 5-day week, extra maternity leave.&nbsp; But at the end of the day, it is the social&nbsp;attitude<p align=left>Column: 666<p> that is important.&nbsp; If people are happy that they can have more children and give them the best that they can and it adds to their life, I think they will have more children.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;we are realistic here.&nbsp; I do not think we are going for 2.1 as the replacement rate.&nbsp; I think we are going for 1.96.&nbsp; So, we have to&nbsp;attract immigrants, obviously quality immigrants.&nbsp; But whether they will stay here after having become permanent residents and to become citizens, it is something that we are not quite sure.&nbsp; There is the point made in the Budget speech that we&nbsp;need Singapore citizens to give birth and their children stay here, because they are more in tune with the way we live, the way we work and the way we play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let us look at this and try and change the way people think about the family while, of course, giving them incentives to do this will always be helpful.&nbsp; But I think that incentives alone will not solve the problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I support the Budget.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</B> Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Budget presented by the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lee Hsien Loong.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this year's Budget has the conspicuous absence of rental rebates and S&amp;C subsidies to HDB households.&nbsp; Instead, there is the top-up of $104 million into the Medisave accounts of older Singaporeans and injecting another $100 million into the Medifund.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased with this shift in emphasis away from dishing out wholesale subsidies to our people.&nbsp; Our population is aging fast.&nbsp; A lot more medical and healthcare resources are required to meet the growing needs of the elderly.&nbsp; With Government budget getting tighter each year, we need to find better ways to optimise the limited public funds to the areas of greater need.&nbsp; I therefore<p align=left>Column: 667<p> welcome the approach to target public subsidies at the segment of the population who needs most help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for some time, the Government had been reluctant to use means testing to determine those Singaporeans who are deserving of public subsidy in healthcare cost.&nbsp; Means testing was ruled out because we were told that the system is cumbersome and not cost effective to administer.&nbsp; It is out of necessity that we now have to use means testing to prioritise the most deserving cases for larger healthcare subsidy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many elderly citizens living in my Kampong Glam constituency.&nbsp; For those who are aged single and poor, help is easily available.&nbsp; There is, however, a sizable number of elderly residents who have little or no CPF savings but find difficulty in getting Government subsidy.&nbsp; Though these elderly citizens have grown up children, their children who earn barely enough to support their own young families could not at the same time contribute to their aged parents' financial needs. This category of elderly feels helpless.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am concerned that with means testing, we may unwittingly deny this marginal group whose circumstances are really in need of Government help. I hope the agency handling means testing would be sympathetic to the needs of the elderly Singaporeans who could not obtain support from their children.&nbsp; Certainly, we do not wish the very young from the lower income group with grandparents to support to suffer in the process.&nbsp; The children require nurturing and attention as they have a long future ahead of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Government revised the CPF savings rate, it was stated that CPF was not intended to be all-encompassing but cover the vast majority of our working <p align=left>Column: 668<p>population.&nbsp; This would mean that there would always be a small proportion of working adults with little or no CPF savings set aside for their old age.&nbsp; If that is the principle adopted, we have acknowledged that there will always be a segment of Singaporeans requiring public assistance and subsidy.&nbsp; I wish to ask how stringent is means testing to be, and would it impose additional financial burden and hardship to the poorer segment of our population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to commend the Ministry of Health for encouraging the use of day surgeries and community hospitals thereby reaping substantial savings in the healthcare cost of Singaporeans.&nbsp; We must continue to find innovative ways to minimise&nbsp;the use of costly infrastructure and expensive medical technology.&nbsp; We should intensify our efforts to provide home nursing care for the non-ambulant cases and greater use of Neighbourhood&nbsp;Day Care Centres for rehabilitation to reduce healthcare cost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's Budget Statement, the Finance Minister announced that the Ministry of Education is reviewing the limit set for Government subsidy in university education, and this is a fundamental change in Government expenditure to the different levels of education.&nbsp; The undergraduates would, in time, have to bear a larger share of the cost of university education.&nbsp; I can appreciate that university education is becoming more common as more and more young Singaporeans are receiving university education.&nbsp; We have also seen that many parents are willing and prepared to incur substantial expenditure in sending their children for overseas university studies and incurring a tidy sum of money.&nbsp; There is also an increasing number who enrol&nbsp;in private institutions conducting undergraduate degree courses for overseas universities as full fee paying students.&nbsp; It is therefore timely to review the current level of subsidy in university <p align=left>Column: 669<p>education with the additional cost&nbsp;to be borne by the students.&nbsp; After all, these students are the main beneficiaries of the university education with the prospect of better paying jobs when they graduate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By putting a cap on university education subsidy, I hope the Government would be more generous and transfer the funds to our neighbourhood secondary schools.&nbsp; The neighbhourhood secondary schools still constitute a substantial proportion of our school population.&nbsp; More teaching and support resources are needed to help the large number of Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) secondary school students.&nbsp; Many of them are disadvantaged by family circumstances.&nbsp; The value and returns in investing in these students would bear fruit and bring positive outcome in the long run.&nbsp; These Normal (Academic) students will be better equipped to face the future with hope, serving as disciplined, motivated and skilful workers, and able to lead independent lives and raising strong families of their own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is bracing itself to operate with leaner budgets and Ministries, other than MINDEF, have been told to cut their expenditure budget by 2% each year.&nbsp; I hope the less privileged in our community will continue to receive their fair share of public funding.&nbsp; As it is, the higher income groups are already enjoying favourable tax treatment, but the lower income groups still have to bear the brunt of GST for their consumption of goods and services for basic essentials.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's Budget also highlighted the need to build the next generation of Singaporeans.&nbsp; Without people, there is no country and nation to speak about.&nbsp; It would be useful for us to pause and ask ourselves what has led to the sad state of affairs that has resulted in the serious decline in the birth rate in Singapore.&nbsp; I am afraid that, in the past, we were too<p align=left>Column: 670<p> caught up with quality and lost sight of the need to ensure that quantity was not affected in the process.&nbsp; We might have presumed that if the better educated were catered to, we are able to bring the number of births up.&nbsp; It is apparent that even the not so highly educated do not contribute their fair share of number of births.&nbsp; In formulating the new fertility-friendly policies, I hope the Government will address the root cause of the problem and find the sustainable solutions over the long term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Child bearing and bringing up children are personal choices and affected largely by individual circumstances.&nbsp; Though the Government can help make it easy with financial incentives and provide conditions conducive to the building up of spousal relationships, people still need to be guided as to how they should spend their money, time and choice of pursuits.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our people have been chasing academic and material success at the expense of love and joy in building relationships, to having children, nurturing and developing them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to develop a positive attitude as a society towards spousal, parent-child and interpersonal relations.&nbsp; Healthy relationships require skills and knowledge to nurture, develop and sustain.&nbsp; It is best when it is inherent and become natural within us.&nbsp; Here, all those who are in leadership positions have to set a good example for the young to follow.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know that procreation is a normal natural human instinct.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we are seeing the phenomenon of unnatural same-sex relationships happening.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will become an added challenge.&nbsp; But the Government must be forthright and state clearly our stand on spousal relationship and protect the sanctity of the family unit.&nbsp; We need to cultivate and strengthen family relationships and to value and treasure them.&nbsp; Just consider the type of activities<p align=left>Column: 671<p> Singaporeans participate in and the amount of time individuals spend on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they contribute to building spousal and family relationships?&nbsp; I hope the Government, employers and community organisations can take stock and organise more programmes of activities</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr&nbsp;Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in supporting the motion.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> faces a major problem with&nbsp;a low birth rate and current measures seem to have lost their attraction.&nbsp; Issues that affect a low birth rate will require changes in policies across many Ministries.&nbsp; The first most important step in this whole exercise of procreation is being able to produce babies without medical hindrances.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; There are two groups of people that we should target.&nbsp; Firstly, those who want to have babies but, because of medical reasons, they have difficulties in having babies.&nbsp; This is what I call the sub-fertile group.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;the group that is motivated to having babies, and they need support for them to be able to get babies.&nbsp; Sub-fertile couples need to be subjected to ART - not as in drawing,&nbsp;colouring or <p align=left>Column: 672<p>painting.&nbsp; ART is a new acronym for Assisted Reproductive Technology.&nbsp; It encompasses various types of methods such as superovulation where women are given hormones to increase the chances of producing eggs, in-vitro fertilisation where the egg is assailed by thousands and thousands of sperms, or&nbsp;intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), which is a more elegant method of fertilising the egg, blastocyst transfer, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, and a host of other techniques.&nbsp; The numbers are not small.&nbsp; As many as one in five couples, after one year of marriage, are not able to have children.&nbsp; And the success rate of assisted reproductive technology is about 45% success rate of pregnancy.&nbsp; However, the take-home baby rate is about half of that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ravages of the economic turmoil the last few years did not only strain our financial institutions but also left our egg bank and our sperm bank broke.&nbsp; With the lack of incentives, not many were willing to donate their eggs or sperms.&nbsp; A colleague of mine told me that in the past, people were quite happy to do so, if you just reimbursed their transport cost.&nbsp; But currently, this is not sufficient to incentivise anybody to donate their eggs or their sperms.&nbsp; Just in case you think that it is all the ladies' fault, this is not the case.&nbsp; In the sub-fertile cohort, male factor problems account for about 40-45% of the problem.&nbsp; It could be because of insufficient numbers, poor motility or the shape of the head of the sperm is not right.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Government should consider paying or co-paying for ART treatment.&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised to read in the papers just in the weekend that the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United Kingdom</st1:place></st1:country-region> government has considered moving in this step.&nbsp; We should also consider increasing the Medisave deduction for ART.&nbsp; Sub-fertility is a true disease.&nbsp; It is not plastic surgery where you are there to improve your external <p align=left>Column: 673<p>facade.&nbsp; Many young couples do not have much disposable income, but&nbsp;have money in their CPF.&nbsp; They have to pay for their housing loan, their car loan, their monthly bills, and they have to give money to their parents.&nbsp; Therefore, they are not left with very much money.&nbsp; The cost of an ART cycle can be up to $10,000, depending on the type of drugs used and the media used.&nbsp; Maximum Medisave deduction is about $4,000.&nbsp; Therefore, there is quite a substantial amount of money that the couple have to come up with for them to go through this cycle.&nbsp; After three cycles of failure, they are usually advised to consider egg donation.&nbsp; I think we should put in measures to incentivise those who have it in abundance to donate their eggs and their sperms.&nbsp; Again, what measures should be considered, I think these we will leave it to the different Ministries.&nbsp; But, certainly, we should look seriously at encouraging people to donate their eggs and sperms.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Currently, we do not allow egg donation if the donor is more than 35 years of age.&nbsp; This would be about the time when they have completed their family and probably that will be a good time for them to donate their eggs too.&nbsp; So we should also review the age limit for egg donation as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second big group is those who are able to have babies medically but do not want to have babies.&nbsp; I think here there are two sub-groups - those who are still single and those who are married.&nbsp; The first group would be what I call the SBC (or Single, Busy and Career-minded) Singaporeans.&nbsp; They are very concerned about their career, they want to climb up in their career path, they are concerned about the cost of housing and financial independence.&nbsp; These factors have led many to live life as singles.&nbsp; Government should look at incentives to encourage young couples to get married earlier.&nbsp; Because if they get married late, which is a trend that is being seen now, at the age <p align=left>Column: 674<p>of 35, the risk of an abnormal pregnancy can be as high as one in 300 pregnancies and continues to increase as the age increases.&nbsp; So, I was a bit concerned when I saw in the news that the school had reacted with alarm at a 15-year old school boy who had boy-girl relationship.&nbsp; I am not sure whether that is the right signal that we are sending to our young that they should not have any boy-girl relationship until perhaps they have finished their university days.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The other group is what I call those who are MBA (Married, Busy and Alone).&nbsp; These are young couples who are so busy with their careers that they spend whatever precious time they have between themselves.&nbsp; They have no time for babies.&nbsp; I think we should look at incentives for them.&nbsp; In addition to tax rebates, it was mooted that the Government wants to consider giving paid maternity leave of four to six months.&nbsp; Well, it may be good for those in the civil service.&nbsp; It may not be the best option in the private sector, especially if the person is very career-driven.&nbsp; The reality is that if this person holds an important post in a company, being away for four to six months can have a major impact on the company, and it is unlikely that in a job market like this that a career-minded woman would like to take this option.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, there is no one size that fits all.&nbsp; The sum that the Government wants to pay for the extra paid maternity leave can also go into another scheme, perhaps what I would call \"infant care centre fees\" for&nbsp;maybe six months to one year.&nbsp; This will give these mothers who want to opt for other choices to opt for this option as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Government should consider giving adequate subsidies and incentives for infant care centres to be started up.&nbsp; Starting an infant care centre is not the same as starting a childcare centre.&nbsp; It is a totally different ball game.&nbsp; Perhaps a preferential rental charge, increased subsidies, assistance in <p align=left>Column: 675<p>employment of trained staff will encourage more to set up infant care centres.&nbsp; If both parents work, they will also need to hire a domestic maid, if their parents are not willing to assist or unable to assist them in looking after the baby.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the Government should review its income ceiling on hiring domestic maids for young couples who have just had babies, and make it easier for them to hire maids to look after their babies.&nbsp; I would even go further to suggest that for young couples who have babies and want to hire a maid to help them look after their babies, the Government should also consider waiving the foreign maid levy for the first three years when the couple have a baby.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need to review some of our manpower policies.&nbsp; A patient of mine was rather concerned because she said that when her children brought their children, in other words her grandchildren, to her house, they would usually bring their maids along because&nbsp;they could not&nbsp;cope with all these little children running around.&nbsp; So the maids would come together with&nbsp;her children to her house.&nbsp; But I understand, and I checked with the Ministry of Manpower, that apparently this was not something that was considered right.&nbsp; It was something that was not according to&nbsp;our manpower policy and, in fact, they could actually get into trouble with the law.&nbsp; I think we need to review this as to how we can allow young couples, when they bring their children to the homes of their parents,&nbsp;to bring their maids across without any fear that they may run afoul of the law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, to ensure that Singapore couples do not cease&nbsp;at two children, Government must then make making babies a breeze and put their minds at ease.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 676<p><p>3.55 pm</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I congratulate the Government on proposing yet another prudent and forward-looking Budget that is both pro-business and pro-future-generation.&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is going through a very difficult transition in an unpredictable global arena.<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; As I see it, the churning of the economic restructuring process, the relaxation of political and &nbsp;&nbsp; cultural controls, the emphasis on creative learning in our schools, the encouragement of a participatory civic culture, and the opening up of our borders not only to trade and investments but also to foreign labour, are all inter-related in ways that produce positive outcomes in some situations, but could also be perceived to be negative in other senses.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I propose to touch on three aspects of the change process that are upon <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; The first aspect has to do with demography in general, and a declining birth rate in particular.&nbsp; The second aspect has to do with the aging population, and the third aspect is on the professionals, managers and executives group.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, demographic changes in the population&nbsp;are an ever recurring theme in the life of any nation.&nbsp; What is critical though is the idea that demographic forces ought to be shaped and brought under certain degrees of control in order that certain long-term national objectives may be met.&nbsp; However, national objectives can conflict with individual objectives.&nbsp; It is important that the Government treads softly and gently in finding modes of reconciliation between long-term national needs and the immediate term preferences expressed by individuals.&nbsp; So, before we even begin to find ways and means to decide whether our procreation policies need revising, we <p align=left>Column: 677<p>have to first and foremost satisfy ourselves that such a reconciliation is possible.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first glance, we may brush aside the need for such an exercise, and simply argue that we should just plunge straight into tinkering with our policy tool-kit.&nbsp; However, if we do not ask ourselves some fundamental questions over this most fundamental of issues, we would simply repeat the same mistakes of the past.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, we had tried to fight the decline of our birth rate by taking out what we thought was the most effective weapon in our armoury - financial incentives.&nbsp; Yet, this approach has not provided the results we have been looking for.&nbsp; From 1.7 in the 1980s, we are now at 1.24 children born to each female.&nbsp; That makes us wonder why a supposedly materialistic citizenry has not responded to incentive schemes that were financially driven.&nbsp; An immediate analysis would be that financial incentives are not enough.&nbsp; And, indeed, that is what some Singaporeans are saying, judging by the feedback of participants at feedback forums.&nbsp; And these Singaporeans may be right!&nbsp; But, in my view, only partly so!&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the chasm between the national imperative and individual ambitions is more profound than a simple two plus two equation.&nbsp;

We need a certain critical mass of a citizen base that is intelligent, productive, educated,&nbsp;and committed if we want to maintain our competitiveness in the new economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need that mass to nurture our local small-medium enterprises to maturity before they take to the jungles of an ultra-competitive global market-place.&nbsp; We also need a critical mass of able-bodied male soldiers to help guard and defend the sovereignty of this nation.&nbsp; At the same time, we also need that critical mass of productive<p align=left>Column: 678<p> Singaporeans to help constitute the tax base upon which the infrastructure of the nation continues to be of such standards as to appeal to the global investment community.&nbsp; We also need that critical mass of solid-base citizens whose tax revenues ensure that we maintain healthy fiscal balances.<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of what I have just cited are indeed national imperatives.&nbsp; In fact, they are absolutely necessary if we hope to be able to survive and sustain ourselves, our vibrancy, our security, and our prosperity as a nation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, at another level, individual Singaporeans have their own set of imperatives.&nbsp; For example, some Singaporeans define quality life as one that is free from the obligations of parenthood. To this group of Singaporeans, having children hinders them from enjoying life to the full, with all its possibilities and potentialities.&nbsp; Other Singaporeans want to have children, but are also in search of a better life for themselves and their offspring. To this group of Singaporeans, having more than one child would materially detract them from achieving the many&nbsp;goals that they set for themselves in life.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One variant of this group of Singaporeans are those who feel that having more children than they can reasonably afford is an&nbsp;irresponsible thing to do because they are not able to give to their children the financial and time resources that they need in their lives.&nbsp; More often than not, this group will give grouse to their feeling that the Government is preaching an inconsistent message: \"On the one hand, they want us to work, on the other hand, they want us to have children. &nbsp;How can that be done?&nbsp; It is difficult because companies these days are too demanding of our time, and the cost of living in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> is just too steep to have more than one.\"&nbsp; There are yet other Singaporeans who face infertility <p align=left>Column: 679<p>problems in their reproductive lives, and having children is biologically impossible or very difficult to achieve.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the nature of the problem is complex, to my mind, the solution should likewise be multi-faceted.&nbsp; Firstly, at some stage in our national life, we have got to define for ourselves what quality life is.&nbsp; Back in the 1960s, when the Government attempted to sort out our then demographic problems, we had a campaign: stop-at-two.&nbsp; The stop-at-two campaign portrayed having lots of children as incompatible with conducive living in a modern metropolis like <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; It did not just put out financial incentives for mothers to have less children, but went on to alter the consciousness of Singaporeans concerning the hassles of having too many children.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I think that Members would agree with me when I say that the campaigning methods of the past will not be as effective in persuading a more sophisticated citizenry of today, particularly when the content of the campaign touches on as personal issue as that of procreation.&nbsp; On the other hand, I also think that Members would agree with me when I say that the broad incentivising methods of the past will not work as they did years ago.&nbsp; Singaporeans have more choices today.&nbsp; To be sure,&nbsp;quality life includes material well-being and a comfortable and secure financial life.&nbsp; But quality of life is more than just that.&nbsp; It must also include values that transcend financial well-being.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> 21 project is a commendable one in that it seeks to define who we are as a people, and what we are becoming as a nation.&nbsp; My feeling though is that the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> 21 project has still not touched on what quality life ought to be for Singaporeans as <p align=left>Column: 680<p>individuals and as families.&nbsp; As a result of our inability to recast a compelling vision of who we are as a people and what quality life is, many Singaporeans still define the procreation issue in terms of the same old divides.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not propose to have all the answers of the nature or content of another campaign.&nbsp; But I do know&nbsp; that&nbsp;we have got to genuinely engage ourselves as a nation to discuss what the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> quality life is about. And the discussion should not be so boxed in as to define quality life in purely individualistic terms, but&nbsp;also encompass an awareness of how the nation's struggle with this issue will inevitably have an impact on whether Singaporeans will continue to secure the conditions for quality life in the future.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nation must go into a soul-searching process, and that means that there must be some shift of our cultural values, along with that of our policies.&nbsp; The Government can lead the way in reshaping our cultural landscape, but that soul-searching process should never stop with the Government.&nbsp; Indeed, if the campaigning process were to begin with the Government, and stop with the Government, it will not reach right into the hearts of Singaporeans.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Short of cultural change, policies may, at best, arrest the decline somewhat, but will not reverse.&nbsp; As such, may I suggest that we adopt a values-driven approach in our attempt to reverse our declining birth rate.&nbsp; The values-driven approach will be holistic and strategically focused, but what sets it apart from other forms of synergy is that it is suffused with a re-orientation of an understanding of what life is about, and what children are about.&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, I do not propose here to define what the vision of life and the vision of the people we ought to become and the types of children we <p align=left>Column: 681<p>ought to be raising. What I am proposing here is a Government-led, but civic-group and community-sustained effort at reorienting our moorings as a nation to one that is more community-minded and&nbsp;one that defines quality life in material and non-material terms.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I have just outlined is addressed to our approach for an overarching strategy.&nbsp; What I would like to do now is to look into the re-workings of substantive policy areas.&nbsp; Based on the feedback of various groups, a few things suggest themselves to me.&nbsp; Before I delve into them at some detail, may I suggest that these policies be targeted at the different groups of Singaporeans, whose differing attitudes to parenting I have outlined earlier in this speech.&nbsp; For Singaporeans who are set on not having children at all, I think there is not much that we can do to persuade them to do otherwise, other than to respect their right of choice.&nbsp; I do not think that getting them to pay more taxes is a fair way to deal with the issue for the simple reason that the Government incentives that would accrue to those who want to have more children would have been paid for from out of the tax coffers anyway. &nbsp;In other words, as far as revenues and expenditures are concerned, those who wish to have&nbsp;children or more of them, would already have enjoyed the benefits that would be extended to them.&nbsp; Some portion of the benefits that they would get to enjoy would already have been paid for by those who do not wish to have children.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as the wish to not have children is concerned, I propose that the Government start to inculcate from a very young age the desirability of having children.&nbsp; This would mean that we would have to target children with the message that having children is one good way towards fulfilment in life, and that having more than one child would not materially detract them from enjoying quality life.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 682<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the cultural level, we should attempt to mould young minds towards the idea of shared responsibility in the home front.&nbsp; When traditionalist attitudes are uprooted from a very young age in the home and community as well as at schools, our young people will grow up to appreciate the necessity of shared responsibility and the young women of the future will not mentally equate child rearing with drudgery for themselves, but is a joy shared by both husbands and wives. At the same time, when paternalistic attitudes are uprooted from a young age, future male bosses will be less likely to be prejudicial towards the needs of working mothers.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, speaking of prejudices against working mothers, I would like to raise my concern here with regard to the recent proposal of the Ministry of Finance to extend the maternity leave of working mothers from eight weeks to, maybe, sixteen weeks or even more. The proposal has it that the Government would be willing to shoulder the wage costs of employing these working mothers for the extra period being proposed, subject to a ceiling, which has yet to be decided upon.&nbsp; However, before attempting such a move, the Government would do well to bear in mind that there are costs that employers have to bear besides&nbsp;the cost of the wages being paid to replacement workers.&nbsp; The main cost that comes immediately to mind is that of the disruption to the work process that may be caused by an extended period of absence from work. The disruption may come in the form of hiring temporary but less experienced workers to cover the duties of the employee on maternity leave.&nbsp; This disruption may cause employers to think twice about hiring mothers, and the practice of discrimination in hiring may become widespread.&nbsp; If our female workers catch wind of such discriminatory practices being endemic in the workplace, they may be reluctant to have children or <p align=left>Column: 683<p>to have more children than what they already have.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To counteract this problem, some may even&nbsp;propose that the policy includes&nbsp;giving males paternity leave as well. This will then ensure a level-playing field between males and females in the process of job recruitment and selection.&nbsp; In other words, our policy should address the issue of the declining birth rate from the employment practices front as well.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those groups of Singaporeans who feel that having children, or having more of them, is good but who feel that they have to cope with the very many demands that will come their way if they decide to have children, a few policy changes can be considered.&nbsp; Companies should be given tax rebates or write-offs for providing childcare facilities at or near the workplace. Alternatively, companies may also enjoy these rebates or write-offs if they provide their female employees with subsidies for enrolling their children at childcare centres. These incentives attract companies to invest in pro-family programmes, instead of only looking at procreation as cost issues.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For female Singaporeans who feel that taking a few years off work to look after their children will only serve to set back their careers, I feel that companies should be provided with the incentives to retrain these women if need be, and to be provided with all the assistance they need to more easily reintegrate their female employees into the work setting. Practically speaking, we may even put a timeframe (such as three years) in which companies get to enjoy these subsidies.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The civil service should set the tone for the rest of the economy.&nbsp; If the civil service does not send out the appropriate message, then I think that the effort would have been wasted.&nbsp; From the<p align=left>Column: 684<p> feedback of various groups&nbsp;that I have talked to, it would appear that the civil service could do more to fully implement the Government's policies to make it easier for women to be reintegrated to work.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another&nbsp;option would be to lower the cost of employing maids.&nbsp; Reduce the maid levy and offer working mothers maid subsidies so that they can employ maids to help look after the children while they are out.&nbsp; Our policy should be to remove key obstacles currently discouraging Singaporeans from having children.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another contributory factor to the decline in birth rate is infertility. Infertility rates are increasing in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Often related to stress and the general pace of life, couples must be encouraged to seek treatment. Infertility treatment needs to be made more affordable and we need to remove the stigma that still lingers. Men in particular must be encouraged to seek infertility treatment and counselling. A public information service needs to be put in place.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second aspect of our demographic issue is on the&nbsp;ageing population.&nbsp;&nbsp; <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> now has the second highest number of senior citizens in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>. Employers are still reluctant to employ people over 50.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

Research, however, indicates otherwise.&nbsp; As such, we need to initiate more public awareness campaigns to acquaint employers with the facts.&nbsp; Measures that could promote such a message and convey our sincerity include&nbsp;increasing the retirement age, mounting \"back-to-work programmes\", and retraining.&nbsp; Older workers are a valuable resource and, as such, should not be wasted.<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp;Sir, I would like to speak on a different issue, ie,&nbsp;that of job creation for professionals,&nbsp;middle&nbsp;executives who are&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 685<p>over 50 and&nbsp;who have been laid off by companies during the retrenchment exercise of recent times.&nbsp; The Budget has not addressed this directly.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many of the jobs for which the PMEs have been trained will not be coming back to Singapore.&nbsp; That, Sir, is structural unemployment.&nbsp; And, for many of those professional and middle-executive managers who also happen to be in their 50s, they will have to reckon with age discrimination in the hiring process as well.&nbsp; If we add to that the hesitance of employers to hire those whom they think to be well paid, then the triple whammy that this group of people are suffering may just be too overwhelming.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, with no prospect in sight for any short-term recovery of their previous positions, I think&nbsp;we need to see if the Government can do something to facilitate their reintegration into the labour force.&nbsp; Quite obviously, the chief means to prepare them for reintegration is that of retraining.&nbsp; Of retraining and job matching, much has been said, and I do not wish to revisit the same ground here.&nbsp; What I do wish to raise though is the possibility of directly creating jobs for this group of formerly employed professionals and middle executives through means of pooling their shared resources.&nbsp; I know that the Singapore Professionals and&nbsp;Executives Co-operative (SPEC)&nbsp;has already taken the first step in this direction, but&nbsp;there is much more to be done to get this idea to gain acceptance&nbsp;among Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is already trying to move our economic base to one that is not solely reliant on MNCs and GLCs, but to help nurture home-grown small and medium enterprises to become global players.&nbsp; This is a very commendable effort.&nbsp; However, I think that there are alternative forms of employment and job<p align=left>Column: 686<p> creation, one of which is to get people to pool their resources to start up co-operatives that can venture into areas like infant care, finance, travel and tourism, retail, restaurants, information technology, and so on.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By pooling their resources, these formerly-employed PMEs are not only able to raise&nbsp;capital, but also contribute their vast expertise, experience, networks, and knowledge in the running of such co-operatives.&nbsp; I strongly encourage Singaporeans to support the rise of more such co-operatives in Singapore, and&nbsp;here I call upon our Government to lend its support by helping to facilitate the cultivation and nurture of such enterprises.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One area that the Government can help facilitate these co-operatives is to extend to them many of the schemes that are currently being administered by SPRING Singapore. &nbsp;For example, assistance can be rendered to these co-operatives to secure loan facilities at attractive rates of interest; technical assistance can be rendered by the various Government agencies;&nbsp; learning programmes can be funded;&nbsp; and technology transfer linkages can be effectuated by bringing these co-operatives and multinational or Government-linked companies together.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to share&nbsp;this observation made by Rodrik in 1997 where it succinctly summarises the responsibility of the state to its people:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"It is not whether you globalise \u20ac\u00a6 it is how you globalise.&nbsp; The world market is a source of disruption and upheaval as much as it is an opportunity for profit and economic growth ...&nbsp;It has now become commonplace to point out that market-oriented reforms require social safety nets to prevent people from falling through the cracks \u20ac\u00a6 The provision of social insurance is an important component of market reforms - it cushions the blow on those most severely affected \u20ac\u00a6 and it avoids a backlash<p align=left>Column: 687<p> against the distributional and social consequences of globalisation.\"</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the point is that whilst we make changes, we must at the same time ensure that we preserve the social compact in the transition.&nbsp; Generally, we agree&nbsp;on the need to lend a helping hand to the least well-off and the most vulnerable in society.&nbsp; But there is much less certainty or agreement about the role of the Government beyond that.&nbsp; Therefore, I see&nbsp;that we have an obligation to the PMEs that we cannot deny: an obligation to give the unemployed PMEs a chance to be economically active again.&nbsp; So long as they cannot be re-engaged economically again, we will have a potentially explosive force to deal with.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, let us welcome the emergence of diverse forms of business enterprises in Singapore, and let us encourage Singaporeans to join with each other to take the initiative to create jobs for themselves.&nbsp; Let us also send out signals that this Government is there to facilitate the process along, to render the necessary assistance, if such be needed, and to stand alongside Singaporeans as they seek ways and means to carve out niches for themselves in the uncertain times ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I support the motion.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, 2004 is an exciting year for Singapore.&nbsp; Around us, elections are all about.&nbsp; In Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan, elections have reached a feverish pitch.&nbsp; From afar, we have the elections in the States.&nbsp; Many of us in Singapore watch these elections with great interest, because the outcome of any one of these elections will have a big impact on our<p align=left>Column: 688<p> policies.&nbsp; At home, Sir, bets are changing fast on when the new Prime Minister in Singapore will take over.&nbsp; Still, in spite of all the talk that the new Prime Minister will be elected by Members of Parliament, I know of no bookmaker who is offering bets on the new man or woman.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while the political transition offers no surprises, the economic transition is far less predictable.&nbsp; We are definitely recovering from a long economic downturn.&nbsp; Our economy appears to be growing well.&nbsp; The question is whether this growth will translate into new jobs, and what kind of jobs.&nbsp; And Mdm Ho Geok Choo is worried that the unemployed who are&nbsp;in their late 40s will be permanently unemployed.&nbsp; Will the unemployment rate fall overall, or will it remain at the present level?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, only one month ago, the US administration, no doubt encouraged by financial analysts, not economists, was almost certain that the continued economic growth in the States would bring about the end of the job famine.&nbsp; The latest February reports proved them terribly wrong.&nbsp; The data confirm what serious labour economists had feared all along, ie, that in spite of the good economic growth, 2004 in the States is likely to be another year of jobless and joyless growth.&nbsp; The unemployment rate today in the States stays at 5.6%.&nbsp; The real unemployment rate is much higher than that because the&nbsp;long-term unemployed have opted out of the job market.&nbsp; So, the employment rate has actually fallen.&nbsp; Today, the debate between John Kerry and George Bush, Jr, is not how to create new jobs.&nbsp; It is how to stem the flow of jobs to India and China.&nbsp; Hence, the heated debates on Capitol Hill on legislating against outsourcing of jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some economists in Singapore think what happened in the States will also happen in Singapore.&nbsp; The Minister<p align=left>Column: 689<p> for Finance did not offer substantial personal goodies, although he offered quite substantial goodies to companies.&nbsp; But I think the Minister for Finance did a good job.&nbsp; He gave a good unexciting Budget.&nbsp; Many may be disappointed because there are no fireworks like&nbsp;personal rebates, tax cuts and reliefs.&nbsp; For the last few years, we have seen a lot of fireworks in this area because moving ahead from 2001 to&nbsp;2004 were uncertain times.&nbsp; The Minister for Finance&nbsp;gave a Budget which he thinks will match the growth this year.&nbsp; He is confident that the growth will be respectable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I share his conviction.&nbsp; I share it because Singapore is quite different from the States.&nbsp; In the case of Singapore, we have seen substantial changes in the economy, structural changes which the United States need not have gone through or did not go through.&nbsp; After the Asian crisis of 1997, the economy has restructured.&nbsp; Our wages have come down substantially.&nbsp; CPF rates have also come down.&nbsp; Land costs - Mr Inderjit Singh is not here - have come down very substantially.&nbsp; Taxes have come down.&nbsp; The once mighty Singapore dollar, which MAS defended with all its might, has also come down.&nbsp; Most of all, expectations have also come down.&nbsp; People are willing to take lower paying jobs, work longer hours.&nbsp; All these mean that we have been right-sized.&nbsp; Singapore is now ready to grow once more.&nbsp; But we need opportunities.&nbsp; But at least we are ready.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Sir, there is no stopping the outsourcing of jobs from the USA.&nbsp; Even as the politicians on Capitol Hill debate in the Congress, more jobs will flow out to Asia, India and China, and Singapore will no doubt catch some of these jobs, if not all of them.&nbsp; We are no longer expensive.&nbsp; We are very educated, and I think we are becoming very hungry again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third,&nbsp;we are small, unlike the USA.&nbsp; And small is an advantage.&nbsp; Although we <p align=left>Column: 690<p>are small, we are cohesive, which means we punch above our collective size of three to four million people.&nbsp; Small means we can move faster, fly further, and bounce up quicker.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, Singapore is one of the most wired places in the world.&nbsp; I do not just mean electronically.&nbsp; I also mean mentally.&nbsp; Geographically and culturally, we are also close to the places where action is taking place - in India and China.&nbsp; These two big engines of economic growth will pull us along just fine.&nbsp; We have learnt to dance with the lion; we can also fly with the dragon.&nbsp; Intellectually, we are on the same wavelength with the western world, particularly the Americans and the Europeans.&nbsp; The fact that we speak mostly in English today is telling in itself.&nbsp; We are truly at the crossroads of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I think this gloom and doom that some Singaporeans talk about, that the best days are behind us, is really quite mistaken, quite unnecessary.&nbsp; We have had more than 30 years of good growth, and only seven years of not-so-good growth.&nbsp; I think it is more than what any one young country could have hoped for.&nbsp; We should think it this way: the worst is behind us, the days ahead can only be better.&nbsp; But in order to catch some of the jobs that could be coming beyond India and China to Singapore, we will first have to change some mindsets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a long time, Sir, we thrived in this region because we speak English, unlike our neighbours.&nbsp; They speak English, but it is not their main administrative language, not their legal language.&nbsp; And this gave us a decisive edge in the past.&nbsp; But no longer.&nbsp; When Mr Lee Kuan Yew opened up our borders and put out a red carpet to MNCs in the 60s, he actually went against the economic advice&nbsp;and&nbsp;political tide of the day.&nbsp; The prophets of post-colonialism preached closed-door self-sufficiency.&nbsp; We did the opposite.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 691<p>We opened up.&nbsp; So, even though Singaporeans spoke less than good English, the world beat a path to our doors.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because we were the most hospitable in the region.&nbsp; They were looking for&nbsp;a low-cost place.&nbsp; They could not go to India; India's doors were closed.&nbsp; They could not go to China.&nbsp; China talked about socialism and communism.&nbsp; The third-world, they were all caught up in the <I>\"merdeka\"</I> or independence movement.&nbsp; So, they came here.&nbsp; But today the world is borderless.&nbsp; Communism is in form but not in substance.&nbsp; Trade and services flow uninhibited between countries, and everybody speaks English.&nbsp; We are 3 to 4 million in Singapore.&nbsp; We claim that we speak English.&nbsp; China has 1,300 million&nbsp;or 1.3 billion people.&nbsp; One percent of that speak English is 13 million.&nbsp; So, it is a substantial number of people in China today who can speak English.&nbsp; I do not have the numbers, but perhaps more than 3 to 4 million people&nbsp;can speak effectively in English and Mandarin.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our labour cost will never be as low as India's.&nbsp; But assuming that it could go as low - God forbid - we would still not be able to attract to Singapore the kind of jobs that have gone to India.&nbsp; Our problem is really our spoken language.&nbsp; And for a long time we think that it does not matter what we speak, so long as we get the job done.&nbsp; In the world of manufacturing, we do not have to speak.&nbsp; In fact, if we go to a clean room, we are all masked up.&nbsp; We are not allowed to speak.&nbsp; But things have changed.&nbsp; A lot of the outsourced jobs from America to India require real-time voice communications or talking.&nbsp; And many people dismiss these as low-paying jobs, eg, telephone operators, telemarketers, or maybe somebody calling DPM to buy insurance.&nbsp; But actually it goes beyond that.&nbsp; Many of these are actually very high-value jobs, for example, lawyers in India masquerading as consultants, giving advice on<p align=left>Column: 692<p> international law;

All these are high-tech jobs, behind the phone, at the end of&nbsp;the line is a very qualified Indian, speaking impeccable English.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also have the talent to speak like an American. If we want&nbsp;a southern accent, they give it to us.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we want a northern accent, they give it to us.&nbsp; Even if we can find as many Singaporeans who are as qualified as the Indians, which is, of course, a dream, we will still lose out because we do not speak English like that. We do not have to speak like the Americans, but we must speak English that is intelligible.&nbsp; In order to poise ourselves to catch some of these high quality outsourced jobs, we really need to declare war on Singlish.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the local English sitcoms flourish on Singlish.&nbsp; The more Singlish spoken on a local English sitcom, the more popular the rating.&nbsp; I think that is doing us in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The English spoken on <I>Channel NewsAsia</I> today bears absolutely no resemblance to the English spoken in this House, or on the streets and in the schools. So when I heard the Ministry of Education saying that X% of Singaporeans speak English at home and therefore, cannot be expected to do well in Chinese, I find it a bit disturbing because clearly,&nbsp;the statement means X% in Singlish.&nbsp; I do not see the correlation why, if we speak Singlish, we cannot do well in Chinese.&nbsp; I grant that if we speak received pronunciation in English, we might have some problems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been following the debate on the learning of Chinese in Singapore.&nbsp; I think it is something we have got to fix because China is&nbsp;another one big economic engine that we cannot afford to <p align=left>Column: 693<p>ignore.&nbsp; Even if we do not see it, we can hear the humming.&nbsp; I think it is very naive, when I read some of the <I>Straits Times' Forum</I> pages'&nbsp;readers,&nbsp;saying business is business,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Chinese will have to speak English because it is an international language.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Chinese can speak English.&nbsp; Many of them can, and those who cannot are learning English with diligence. That could be history.&nbsp; For over 200 years, the Chinese have been trampled upon by the west. They have never forgotten the humiliation.&nbsp; Today, a resurgent China is speaking their language, be it the Chinese language or trade language, or the language of diplomacy or economics on Chinese terms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</B></p><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">4.35 pm</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example is the recent ruling that they enacted on the sale of software. The new rule says that if we do not allow the software to be source-code open for Chinese programmers to write or to edit, then that software cannot be sold in China. This is one way where they are changing the rules.&nbsp; In manufacturing, for example, they are also setting new standards which&nbsp;the Chinese feel comfortable, in other words, standards which they are superior in.&nbsp; We have to manufacture to their standards, otherwise, we cannot sell our manufactured products in China.&nbsp; Does it matter?&nbsp; I think it does.&nbsp; Can any supplier afford to ignore a market of 1.3 billion consumers?&nbsp; In short, China is now saying today that, \"We have the market, you want my business, you are welcome, but you speak my language.\"</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to encourage my fellow Singaporeans to learn Chinese and learn it well.&nbsp;Contrary to popular belief in the English media,&nbsp;it is not too difficult a language to learn. To master it is a<p align=left>Column: 694<p> different issue. To learn it,&nbsp;it is not so difficult. We have got to remember that there are hundreds of millions of very clever people around the world who are good in English. If we are one of them, it is really no big deal.&nbsp; But there are not so many people, maybe tens of millions who are effectively bilingual -&nbsp;English and Chinese - and who are clever up here [<I>indicating</I>].&nbsp; If we are lucky to count ourselves as one of those people, I think we can make a good living, bridging the west with China.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many educated English elites lament that it is difficult to learn Chinese. Why?&nbsp; Because they themselves do not speak Chinese.&nbsp; I think this should not itself be a problem. The simple answer to parents who do not speak English at home or cannot speak English is basically to first send them to a PAP PCF and, secondly, to a neighbourhood primary school.&nbsp; I speak Chinese but I am never home to speak to my children in Chinese.&nbsp; Like most MPs, we leave home before they wake up and we go back after they have gone to bed.&nbsp; In my case, my wife does not speak a word of Chinese because she never studied in Singapore not one single day. When I am at home, I do not speak Chinese.&nbsp; I speak English.&nbsp; Hence, my family is in the same position as many English-educated parents who find it difficult to encourage their children to speak Chinese.&nbsp; So it was a conscious&nbsp;decision to enrol our children in a neighbourhood school just near to where we live and the results are most encouraging.&nbsp; My children picked up Mandarin like little ducks to water.&nbsp; They found it absolutely easy.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because in that school, all the Chinese students speak Mandarin. They come from Mandarin-speaking homes. They watch Mandarin programmes,&nbsp;they sing Chinese songs,&nbsp;they play Chinese games.&nbsp; In such an environment, Sir, it is impossible not to speak and write Chinese.&nbsp; We are convinced that we did the right thing, at least up to now because my friends, some<p align=left>Column: 695<p> of whom are in this House, warned me that if I send my children to some of the branded name schools, my children might not speak Chinese.&nbsp; I asked them why. They said because in the named schools, the children speak English&nbsp;and they come from middle-income, English-speaking homes,&nbsp;even though the school may carry a Chinese label.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My advice to parents who think that their children would have problems learning Chinese is to do the simple thing by sending them to&nbsp;the nearest neighbourhood school.&nbsp; All primary schools in Singapore follow the same syllabus.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to PSLE, they all take a common examination.&nbsp; All schools are structured to teach more or less in the same way.&nbsp; I believe that if a child is academically clever, he or she will do well in PSLE, whatever school he or she attends.&nbsp; If a child is not so academically well-endowed, it is better for him or her to go to a neighbourhood school because the environment there is more friendly and, at the same time, he or she can pick up Mandarin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at it objectively, look at all the branded schools, not all the children&nbsp;go to the top four schools - RI, RGS, Nanyang Girls and Chinese High.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, if you look at the background of these students in these four schools, you find many of them come from neighbourhood schools.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, the English media was flooded with letters from parents whose children suffered from learning Chinese. Even today, the <I>Straits Times' Forum</I> page ran two long letters.&nbsp; I suspect that there is real&nbsp;angst among the English-educated. But the problem, I suspect, is confined to the English-educated Chinese elites.&nbsp; It is not a problem&nbsp;with HDB heartlanders.&nbsp; While I empathise with their problem,&nbsp;I think they should not be too afraid.&nbsp; The Ministry of Education has made some changes and I agree with <p align=left>Column: 696<p>those changes.&nbsp; The University of Singapore enrols undergraduates who cannot speak English well.&nbsp; Many foreign students who come to our universities need extensive remedial English lessons. So why do we lock out Singapore students who are not good in Chinese?&nbsp; We should allow these students who do not do well in Chinese, to enrol into the university. There is no need to discriminate them against their inability to master the language. The marketplace of jobs will ultimately discriminate against them one way or the other.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the vast majority of&nbsp;Chinese Singaporeans,&nbsp;the learning of Chinese is not a big issue.&nbsp; In fact, Chinese is&nbsp;widely spoken on the university campuses.&nbsp; It is, in fact, the preferred language of choice of a vast majority of students.&nbsp; I know because I have been living in the university campus, not teaching there,&nbsp;for 13 years.&nbsp; I stayed on top of&nbsp;the canteen. I&nbsp;went&nbsp;there quite often and I mixed with the students.&nbsp; I&nbsp;saw them at the bus-stops, I&nbsp;gave them lifts.&nbsp; I spoke with them in Chinese. They taught me many Chinese phrases.&nbsp; They sang in Chinese and talked in Chinese. With a thriving community of Chinese mainland undergraduates now on both campuses, I am sure more students will speak good Mandarin.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if we look at the TV viewership ratings as well as the radio listenership ratings, we will not be surprised to find the phenomena that Chinese is&nbsp;the preferred language of the Chinese community, contrary to all the letters that have been appearing in the English media. The viewership on <I>Channel 8</I> is always higher than the viewership on <I>Channel 5</I> and that of <I>Channel U</I> is higher than that of <I>Channel I</I>.&nbsp; Some years ago, a media specialist told me that local English sitcoms would receive higher ratings than Chinese sitcoms.&nbsp; I asked why.&nbsp; He said that the English-educated actors on the English sitcoms are more academically <p align=left>Column: 697<p>qualified so they can learn the tricks of the trade and&nbsp;bring their art to a better form for the audience.&nbsp; I am not sure whether he was right. I demurred.&nbsp; But the results vindicated me.&nbsp; Even though there are no more Chinese schools, all of us speak English of one form or another in schools. Chinese students in English schools today still prefer to watch Chinese programmes, sing Chinese songs and play Chinese games.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not watch TV but I read in the press that&nbsp;one Chinese sitcom, <I>Holland Village</I>, received such high viewership that on some episodes, the viewership was close to&nbsp;one million people.&nbsp; An MP's wife told me recently that after watching the long running series, she was inspired to re-learn her Chinese which she has forgotten and did not learn seriously when she was in school.&nbsp; I think this problem of learning Chinese in schools for Chinese students should be placed in the right perspective.&nbsp; It is a problem for some, but it is not a problem for all.&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, one <I>Straits Times'</I> reader suggested that to make it fun, teachers should tell stories in schools instead of asking students to do assessments,&nbsp;listen to Chinese pop music, talk about pop stars, etc.&nbsp; I think she has a point there, but all these multi-media aids are actually available on the TV. Obviously, this parent does not allow the child to watch <I>Channel 8</I> or <I>Channel U</I>.&nbsp; I think it is not quite necessary for the teacher to repeat what is happening in the pop world,&nbsp;music or movie world in the classroom.&nbsp; The Chinese has a saying, \"<I>san ren cheng hu</I>\", which means that if three persons talk about something which did not happen, bystanders will think something actually has happened.&nbsp; All this talk about Chinese being a very difficult language to learn is doing us harm.&nbsp; It is not just a language issue.&nbsp; It is an economic issue.&nbsp; It is the survival of the future issue.&nbsp; For Singapore to tap into the fast-growing market of China, we should learn the language <p align=left>Column: 698<p>seriously.&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I do not lose sleep over all this talk that Chinese is difficult to learn, that we should not learn it or we should not allow the children to suffer anymore.&nbsp; <I>Kiasu</I> Singaporeans will know what to do.&nbsp; The marketplace of jobs will decide whether Chinese is important or not.&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the more intractable problem which has been talked about in this House is the low birth rate and the consequent problem of a greying population.&nbsp; Minister Khaw Boon Wan is not here but he pointed out correctly that Singapore's healthcare problem is not a serious one and that our healthcare is one of the best in the world because of many reasons - the share of GDP is low, there&nbsp;are few admissions to the hospitals and hospital stay is also short.&nbsp; This is no doubt due to good administration and policy on the part of the Ministers in charge.&nbsp; But there is also a very important demographic factor that underlies all these good statistics because we were a young nation and we are still relatively a young nation.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I am sure this problem is well taken care of.&nbsp; The underlying problem is that if we have a large pool of old people to take care of it is still not a serious problem if we have enough young people to carry them.&nbsp; But we do not have young people coming forward to take care of the older people that are becoming old.&nbsp; The reasons are plenty.&nbsp; They have been seriously discussed in the media and in this House.&nbsp; I am confident that, Minister Lim Hng Kiang will come out with a good proposal.&nbsp; But whatever we do, we should not try to use money to buy babies because using money to buy babies is only a short fix for a long-term problem.&nbsp; In the longer term,<p align=left>Column: 699<p> we really need to change the environment.&nbsp; Changing the environment is the key to sustainable solution to more births.&nbsp; Many people say that Singaporeans are so busy that they have no time to make babies and that when the babies come they have no time to nurture the babies, no time to look after the babies.&nbsp; There is a grain of truth in all these.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MINDEF has several overseas air detachments, one in France, several in the States.&nbsp; If you look at the behaviour of our airmen out there you will find that it is quite different from what they do here.&nbsp; Basically, they have a baby boom there.&nbsp; Last year, I was up in Arizona and saw some of the airmen there.&nbsp; I have never seen so many pregnant wives and young babies.&nbsp; It is not a big detachment and I feel happy for them.&nbsp; These are young families there, training very seriously to become Apache pilots and engineers and technicians.&nbsp; So even as they train, they find time to make babies.&nbsp; But obviously the environment there is conducive and I urge the Government to put in place some of the environment that encourage babies to come about.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</B> <I>(In Mandarin)</I>:&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at a time when our economy is beginning to recover, the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lee has given us a very prudent Budget and urged us to tighten our belts so that we can face the challenges ahead.&nbsp; This is a very wise decision.&nbsp;<p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although my grassroots leaders and residents have told me that there is nothing special about this Budget, I told them that at this crucial time, we have to be very prudent in dealing with our economy so that we can have good long term strategies to compete with other <p align=left>Column: 700<p>countries.&nbsp; I would like to speak on a few aspects.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, on tax incentives.&nbsp; I fully agree with the Government's focus on helping the needy ones by topping up the CPF accounts of those who are in need.&nbsp; We are helping our old people so that they can have enough in their Medisave accounts for their needs in the old age.&nbsp; But we know that we are facing an aging problem and, because of the small family structure, many old people are facing a lot of problems, particularly when they are single.&nbsp; There are more and more old people who have no one to depend on.&nbsp; So the Government is spending more time and effort to look after them.&nbsp; This is good.&nbsp; But, in our society, there are people who show care and concern for the old people and have the love to adopt them and allow these old folks to stay with them. I think this is very good indeed.&nbsp; In fact, there are a few such cases in my constituency. Children who maintain their parents enjoy tax relief from $5,000 to $8,000.&nbsp; I feel that the Government should consider granting tax&nbsp;relief also to those charitable persons who adopt these old people and allow them to stay in their house. With such an incentive, we would be able to encourage more Singaporeans to express their care and concern for the old people.&nbsp; There may not be&nbsp;many such&nbsp;Samaritans, but I think this would be a good start to encourage our people to have this love and care for the old people.&nbsp; I hope that the Minister for Finance would consider extending tax incentives to those people who volunteer to look after&nbsp;unrelated senior citizens.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, on assistance to the SMEs.&nbsp; In restructuring our economy, we have adjusted our CPF contribution rates, and we&nbsp;are also promoting flexible wage system.&nbsp; This is the Government's effort to help cut down business costs.&nbsp; But, compared to the other countries in <st1:place>Asia</st1:place>, such as&nbsp;<st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and some of the <p align=left>Column: 701<p>Southeast Asian countries,&nbsp;our business cost is still on the high side.&nbsp; We should try our best to reduce rental by 20% and also give maybe 10% rebate on the PUB charges for the factories.&nbsp; This is very important.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;adjusted the CPF and wage cost, but the entire business cost, factory rental overheads and other expenses are also very important.&nbsp; When we reduce the rental we should consider one thing, that is, <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> dollar's conversion rate to another currency is quite high.&nbsp; One <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> dollar is equivalent to 4.8 reminbi (yuan).&nbsp; Of course, we cannot reduce our level to that of <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region> or <st1:place>Hong Kong</st1:place>, but we should try to keep it down so that we could be more competitive and attract more foreign investors to come here. Otherwise, the capitalists and the entreprenuers will go to <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region> and other <st1:place>Southeast Asian</st1:place> countries where the business cost is lower, and this will be a heavy blow to our economic growth.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that the Minister for Finance has also announced tax exemption for the start-up companies for the first three years.&nbsp; But we know that for start-up companies who just started business, the chances of them making profit within the first three&nbsp;years are not very good.&nbsp; Although some do make some profit, in most cases, they do not make profit during the first three&nbsp;years.&nbsp; So I would suggest that this $100,000 tax exemption incentive be extended.&nbsp; For example, in <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>, they have&nbsp;full exemption for the first three years, and then on the 4th and 5th years, only half of the profit is subjected to tax.&nbsp; I think such a measure would be a better way to help our local people to be more enterprising.&nbsp; So, perhaps for the first three&nbsp;years, they could be exempted from paying tax, and for the next two years they could have a 50% rebate.&nbsp; I think this will help to encourage more young people to become entrepreneurs or set up new companies.&nbsp; With the setting up of new companies, more job opportunities could be created  <p align=left>Column: 702<p>for our people.&nbsp; So, this is \"killing two birds with one stone\".</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also encourage the SMEs to have better entrepreneurial spirit.&nbsp; In other countries, for example in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Taiwan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, the governments spent a lot of money and efforts to help their local SMEs.&nbsp; When MNCs or big companies went there to invest, they would encourage their local SMEs to cooperate with these MNCs or big companies and to learn from them how they operate their business. Once these MNCs relocate their business elsewhere after their tax incentives have expired or&nbsp;they have found other places where they can operate in a cheaper way, these local companies would then be able to take over from them and thereby continue to create job opportunities.&nbsp; I think we should learn from them.&nbsp; So whenever MNCs come to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> to invest, we should encourage our local SMEs to approach them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should support them and give them all types of incentives so that our SMEs would be able to work with these MNCs.&nbsp; I believe this would be a better policy.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time when our economy is just beginning to recover, we have to look into how we could reduce the business cost across the board.&nbsp; Because if&nbsp;we do it only on a sectoral basis like, for example, adjusting the CPF or wages and do not adjust the rentals, then I would say this is not a full cost-reduction exercise.&nbsp; As it is said in Hokkien, \"You have 10 pots but only 9 covers.\"&nbsp; No matter how hard you try, you will not be able to&nbsp;cover all the 10 pots.&nbsp; We have to work on it in a more comprehensive manner to address this problem of business cost.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's Budget may be slightly different from before, because we are talking about procreation.&nbsp; Although giving birth to a baby is a private matter between&nbsp;husband and wife,&nbsp;which the Government should not interfere in, when<p align=left>Column: 703<p> we consider the exceptionally low total fertility rate, the Government&nbsp;has little choice but to step in to help.&nbsp;&nbsp; But as I have said, giving birth to children is not an easy thing. If the Government wants to be involved, it should do so thoroughly. This is an inter-ministerial project.&nbsp; I fully agree that an inter-ministerial committee be set up, headed by Minister Lim Hng Kiang.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This low fertility rate has a great impact on our family structure.&nbsp; In the early days, like the 1960s and 1970s, we had big families.&nbsp; For example, in my family, I have four sisters and five brothers.&nbsp; So there are nine siblings altogether.&nbsp; In a big family, during the day, everybody goes to work.&nbsp; At night, we would all gather together&nbsp;as one big family.&nbsp; The parents will then speak to us about family values.&nbsp; The men would talk about how to do business and the women would talk about how to look after the children and the pleasure of having children. Our parents would encourage us to have more children.&nbsp;To them, one more child means simply adding one bowl and a pair of chopsticks.&nbsp; The additional cost is not very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a big family, we look after one another.&nbsp; We, in fact, compete with one another on the number of children to have.&nbsp; Every year, we had at least one new baby in the big family, and it came very naturally.&nbsp; My three elder brothers and an elder sister have an average of 4 children each. Now that they have all moved out, all forming small families, myself, my younger brother and younger sister have an average of 2 children only, so naturally the family size has reduced.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we&nbsp;want to encourage Singaporeans to have more children, I think it involves many aspects.&nbsp; First, our people are marrying late nowadays.&nbsp; In the early days, 1960s and 1970s, the average marriage age was about 25-27. Now it is about 28-30.&nbsp; After marriage, the couple<p align=left>Column: 704<p> would have an agreement not to have a baby for the next three or five years, and then at the age of 35 when they begin to have this intention to have children, they may not even be able to conceive.&nbsp; So we should encourage our people to marry early and to have baby early.&nbsp; So this is the first thing the MCDS should do.&nbsp; I hope that we should have seminars and campaigns to encourage our people to marry early and to have children early.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I mentioned that the couples nowadays marry late and they do not want to have children until much later. So, this will involve the Ministry of Health.&nbsp; Some young couples wanted to have children but could not conceive.&nbsp; They go for medical treatment.&nbsp; If they go to a consultant, it would cost them a lot of money. So this is a Ministry of Health's problem.&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of Health would help these young couples.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, on maternity leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;After nine months of pregnancy, there will surely be some disruption to their work efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the birth, they have two months of maternity leave.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will cause some inconvenience not only to the employer but also to the employee herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Somebody suggested that we should extend the maternity leave to four months or even five months.&nbsp;&nbsp; I personally feel that the extension of maternity leave may not be beneficial.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it may even have an adverse effect.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, having left your job for four to five months, the employer will have to engage someone to take over the job.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if this replacement worker or manager does not have the efficiency or competence, then the employer will be unhappy, and this dissatisfaction could be extended to the employee herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the replacement is more efficient and competent, and after four to five months, the employer is used to the way this replacement staff works and would simply brush aside the original employee when she reports back to work after her long maternity leave.&nbsp; I think we should <p align=left>Column: 705<p>seriously rethink the suggestion to extend the maternity leave.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the Government should consider setting up \"nanny centres\" to look after the new babies.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can engage nannies to help the new mothers look after their babies, and also to do some of the household chores during the maternity period.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would also provide some job opportunities for our women folk.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you cannot find someone who is competent in this, maybe the Ministry of Manpower could introduce a B (baby) pass so that we can allow foreign nannies with the competence to come here on a temporary basis to take up this job of&nbsp; looking after the babies.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why am I making this suggestion?&nbsp;&nbsp; If we were to extend the maternity leave with the Government subsidising for the extension period, then with 50,000 babies a year, and the average mother's salary at $2,000 per month, the Government will have to subsidise $100 million per year for&nbsp;each month's extension.&nbsp;&nbsp; For two months, it will be $200 million.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in five years, the Government will have to spend $1 trillion, and even this sum may not&nbsp;get you the number of babies that you want.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we have to seriously look into the extension of maternity leave for new mothers.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I would like to talk about CPF.&nbsp; After giving birth, new mothers could not make use of their Medisave to pay for 100% of the medical fees. &nbsp; Some of these young mothers do not have enough cash, but they do have CPF.&nbsp;&nbsp; We should help these young mothers by allowing them to use their CPF to pay 100% of their medical fees in order to solve the problem of cashflow.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we should look into childcare and baby care service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays, women are facing problems with baby care.&nbsp;&nbsp; After giving birth, they have two<p align=left>Column: 706<p> months of maternity leave.&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, both the husband and wife will have to go out and work.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they can afford a maid, then it is not so bad.&nbsp; But what happens if they cannot afford to have a maid? &nbsp; This is when baby-care service comes in handy.&nbsp; In every housing estate, there should be at least one baby care service centre, so that these young mothers could go back to work after their maternity leave and the babies would have a good environment to be looked after well.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On childcare aspect, I think MCDS has set up childcare centres in every constituency.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the operating hours of childcare centres are a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; They open at&nbsp;<st1:time Minute=\"0\" Hour=\"8\">8 am</st1:time>&nbsp;and close at&nbsp;<st1:time Minute=\"0\" Hour=\"18\">6 pm</st1:time>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The parents could only send the child to the childcare centre after <st1:time Minute=\"0\" Hour=\"8\">8 am</st1:time> and have to pick the child up before&nbsp;<st1:time Minute=\"0\" Hour=\"18\">6 pm</st1:time>. &nbsp; This is certainly not convenient to the working parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could we not extend the working hours to start at <st1:time Minute=\"0\" Hour=\"7\">7 am</st1:time> and end at <st1:time Minute=\"0\" Hour=\"20\">8 pm</st1:time>?&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the parents would be able to send their children to the childcare centres as early as&nbsp;<st1:time Minute=\"0\" Hour=\"7\">7 am</st1:time> and pick up their children as late as&nbsp;<st1:time Minute=\"0\" Hour=\"20\">8 pm</st1:time>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there will be enough time for them to pick up their children after their work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, on education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many young women have complained to me that now that the child is three years old, they want to start doing some volunteer work for the school near their home so as to gain priority in enrolling the child there.&nbsp; They said, \"If I do not do some volunteer work, I would not be able to send my child to a school near my home.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; To the parents, this is a big burden.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the child cannot go to a school nearby, then every day they will have to spend a lot of time sending the child to school and fetching the child after work.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not for just one month, but for the entire period of six years in the primary school. This is a long-term problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I hope that the Ministry of Education would look into this matter. Children staying within two kilometres of the schools should be given places there.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 707<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, on media publication.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, if we look at the newspapers, we can see a lot of advertisements about slimming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody likes to be beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think slimming is something that everybody is looking forward to.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if there are too many advertisements, when women look at these advertisements, they get worried.&nbsp;&nbsp; They say, \"Now that I have a child, I will lose my figure.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I compete with all these young slim people?\"&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that something could be done to prevent&nbsp; these slimming advertisements from painting ugly pictures of pregnant women, thereby&nbsp; causing some sort of psychological burden on pregnancy.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Koo Tsai Kee mentioned about the TV serial, <st1:place><st1:PlaceName><i>Holland</i></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType><i>Village,</i></st1:PlaceType></st1:place> which received positive feedback by the viewers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps we should also throw in some message on happy family or the joy of having more children.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think such contents in these TV serials will help to send the message to our young people so that they would want to have babies.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, now I would like to talk about one very important issue. &nbsp; Every year, we hope to have 50,000 babies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, we had only 37,000,&nbsp; 13,000 babies short of the target.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, for the last four years from 1997 to 2000, there were some 13,000 abortions each year, about 30% of the fertility rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the reasons for these abortions?&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there are two types:&nbsp; First, for the married woman, after their pregnancy, why do they want to abort their babies?&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe they must have their reasons. I hope that the inter-ministry committee will set up a special task force to counsel women, who want to go for abortion, to find out the reasons for abortion. &nbsp; Is it because of financial problem?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it because of family dispute or some other pressures like work<p align=left>Column: 708<p> pressure, family pressure or other reasons?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think if we were to have a thorough understanding of the reasons why pregnant women go for abortions, we would be able to achieve some good results, ie, reducing the number of abortions.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group is the unmarried young women.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this is also a serious matter which we should pay attention to.&nbsp;&nbsp; To my understanding, about two-thirds of the abortions are from the married women and one-third from the unmarried women.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the committee should look into this matter and find out why they go for abortions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe we should be able to save more babies and this is a direct channel for them to save the babies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, we have 37,000 babies.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we can save the 13,000 babies from abortion each year, we would have attained our target of 50,000.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we want to encourage our people to have more babies.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not something that can be done overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a long-term job that is to be undertaken by many Ministries.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, we have to inculcate in our young citizens the responsibility of having children and also on the correct family values.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, on the one hand, we have to give them incentives and help them to solve their problems;&nbsp;on the other hand, we should also inculcate in them the proper values through education.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest that the Government start a \"Happy Family Movement\".&nbsp; This movement is not just to encourage every family to have children, but for our grassroots and community organisations to inculcate in our people, through education, the values and responsibility of having children.&nbsp;&nbsp; We should send this message to every citizen so that they can understand the future problems of our society and the importance of having children.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think if everybody has a good understanding of this problem, then all the other problems could be solved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</B> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to speak on the issues related to the Budget 2004.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My comments are on two matters&nbsp; -&nbsp; the procreation policy and the proposal to reduce subsidies for university education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on&nbsp;procreation policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to, first, commend the Government on taking a stance to be less prescriptive in this area.&nbsp; Though we are stuck with the possibility of becoming an endangered species or to put it less alarmingly, in spite of this gravity of not replacing ourselves, it is astute and sensitive of the Government to be more consultative and collaborative in looking for solutions on an issue that is, at the same time, so very personal and yet has such national implications.&nbsp; This is a refreshing change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On procreation policy, let me, first, discuss it as a 'fit' question</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>that in some instances we have not looked at who wants babies, people who are trying hard to become parents&nbsp;to assess&nbsp;how we can&nbsp;help them along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, Dr Michael&nbsp;Lim has elaborated on the&nbsp;ART of trying to have children.&nbsp; I will look at when the biological struggle&nbsp;to have a child fails, what are the other options and how can the state help in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 710<p>Parent wannabes&nbsp;can be persuaded to adopt, and right now the process is becoming less painful, with MCDS setting up two VWOs to look into this area.&nbsp; The question here is:&nbsp; can we further enhance the easing of this adoption scheme and allow desperate couples to get their children from overseas or locally as soon as possible?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other area was also&nbsp;brought up by Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mayor Heng Chee How&nbsp;about abortions.&nbsp; We have 14,000 abortions roughly in a year.&nbsp; Is it possible, like Mr Ang Mong Seng said, to look into how we can persuade single mothers-to-be or married couples to reconsider aborting their healthy foetuses and instead support them to full-term pregnancies and, perhaps if they so wish, put up their children for adoption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also perhaps time to review the baby drop idea that was discussed in this Parliament last year.&nbsp; A baby drop idea might help mums in trouble to drop off their babies for adoption rather than to go for an abortion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also another group of singles who do want to adopt babies.&nbsp; If they are part of an extended family structure which we do recognise, and there are in some cases wonderful aunts and uncles, is it possible to slaughter this sacred cow and offer them a process of adoption too?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, there is another group of men and women who cannot wait to start families.&nbsp; Yes, many of them are married to work permit holders and former foreign domestic workers.&nbsp; They face an uphill task in securing PR or citizenship status for their families, and so continue to conduct their lives split over two countries.&nbsp; I have come across two cases of good responsible <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> men, both married to ex-domestic workers.&nbsp; Both ex-domestic workers carry wonderful recommendations by their <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> ex-employers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 711<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If these domestic workers have helped our own <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> children, would it not then be a natural conclusion to say that when it comes to their very own, they will help&nbsp;bring them up as good responsible citizens?&nbsp; Is it possible also when we look at these short-term solutions, to see whether we can review or relax&nbsp;on the criteria of assessment of such Singapore men or women who are married to work permit holders?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, in these short-term solutions, there is a concern over the diverse origins of babies which we will bring in through adoption or through marriages to spouses of foreign countries -&nbsp;I think we can believe in our own system that we do have a meritocratic system, we have great emphasis on responsible parenting, and&nbsp;we have a wonderful scheme of lifelong learning programmes.&nbsp; Put the three together, I think the chances of having children not being brought up as good citizens of this country will be very small.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next,&nbsp;we look at another group of Singapore citizens who have decided for whatever reasons best known to them that they do not want to have babies or are happy to have one or two, and that is that.&nbsp; We have heard Mr Tan Soo Khoon speak about how it costs about $77,000 to bring a child right through&nbsp;university, and in terms of real years,&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;a century.&nbsp; If this is how costly, perhaps in personal terms, it can be to an individual couple, maybe it is also time to stop badgering&nbsp;these couples to let them make their own choices, to give them the due respect that they are asking for,&nbsp;suspend judgment, and look at where the fit can work better for us.&nbsp; Couples who really want to have babies, we can see&nbsp;how we can help them, and even if it means that a particular family is already with five children and is looking towards their sixth,&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 712<p>we can give them the support that is needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long-term approach to delivering more babies in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> lies in a structural setup.&nbsp; The baby shortage problem is every citizen's.&nbsp; Till today, the language used by some colleagues, the media and employers have squarely put that responsibility on the women.&nbsp; We are today still seeing a policy of men being heads of the household.&nbsp; With that policy comes all other policy matters, from medical benefits to definitions of leave, etc.&nbsp; This whole suggestion of even offering six months' leave has been termed as maternity leave.&nbsp; That alone shows that we are still putting the responsibility back on the mothers-to-be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to say, as Mdm Halimah Yacob had also brought this up, that we should reconfigure the status, we should reconsider packaging this leave not as maternity leave, etc, but as parental leave.&nbsp; In <st1:country-region><st1:place>Norway</st1:place></st1:country-region>, fathers and mothers have joint childcare leave which is left to the parents to decide as a team between them.&nbsp; Of the 42 weeks with full pay entitlement, the mother is only entitled to three weeks before and six weeks after birth.&nbsp; The rest of that 42 weeks is a negotiation between father, mother and the employer.&nbsp; This will be an ideal way of placing joint responsibility of bringing up children between parents, fathers and mothers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we are really serious about trying to fix this problem on a longer term basis, then we really need to look at what are our policy structures in terms of what we consider the status of women.&nbsp; Gender mainstreaming has to become part and parcel of how we approach a lot of our policies.&nbsp; On these, let me also talk about some other schemes.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The five-day week has to become, in my opinion, a reality.&nbsp; We still have a five-and-a-half day week.&nbsp; I would love to <p align=left>Column: 713<p>know what studies show how productive that half day really is.&nbsp; Yet, we have many industries that work on a 24/7 model.&nbsp; When we have a 24/7 model, why do we not work on a five-day week, spread from one Sunday to the next Saturday?&nbsp; Employers, if they have such flexible arrangements, can offer parents whatever scheme that they can fit into the whole structure of that organisation, instead of having that half a day that intrudes into family life too.&nbsp; At the same time, we also have to relook at&nbsp;what employers term as compulsory activities for their employees, especially on their weekends, because we have to keep aside time as a family, and I think employers at times try to put quite a lot of pressure on that balance between family and the workplace.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is on&nbsp;the six months' maternity leave.&nbsp; As I have mentioned, the Norway example offers us some good lessons and maybe we can modify it to our own experience, meaning that after perhaps two to three months of leave being given to the mothers, then it becomes a joint decision with the employer, the father and the mother on how the rest of the leave is to be shared.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tax relief should be extended to all children irregardless&nbsp;if you are a twin or a triplet, or even a quadruplet.&nbsp; Because I think a child does not deserve to be known as a child without the tax relief.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Infant care and childcare are not just questions of facilities.&nbsp; We need to look at how accessible they are to the employees and how are they staffed.&nbsp; We have a good pool of retired teachers, nurses who may really wish to be retrained as childcare teachers.&nbsp; I think we can look into this area to enhance the pool for childcare resources.&nbsp; On foreign domestic workers, much has been said already. But I think we need to look at whether it is necessary to have a foreign domestic worker as being domiciled within the <p align=left>Column: 714<p>home.&nbsp; The concept of having foreign domestic workers on wheels is an option that, I think, many parents would welcome.&nbsp; So it works like a childcare until the parents come home, then the foreign domestic worker goes off to another setup to begin the next day.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, on the issue of the foreign domestic worker, we conducted a seminar last year, and it was very telling that we had a&nbsp;young girl who was about to be married and she asked this pertinent question that I would like to share.&nbsp; She said that for the last, almost more than two decades, we have had the foreign workers.&nbsp; &nbsp;She wanted to start a family.&nbsp; She asked, \"Where are the childcare facilities and infant care centres that are close enough to my home or to my employer, such that for all these years that we have been paying the levy for the maid, that money could have been used to bring about more childcare centres, more facilities and&nbsp;better resources within easy reach?\"&nbsp; And that is a question that, I think, we do not have an answer.&nbsp; Maybe there can be an answer later.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another point - I think the most important of all, I suppose - is socialisation, which quite a number of Members brought up.&nbsp; How do we wish to perhaps socialise a nation to look and to value children again, to see the whole responsibility, not&nbsp;just as having children for the nation but to enjoy the child.&nbsp; I think, so far, we have forgotten that children are there to be enjoyed.&nbsp; We have used words, even in some of the discussions here, like 'yield', 'buy', which are commercial terms.&nbsp; I quite understand perhaps why we use these terms.&nbsp; But if we are going to talk about socialisation, if we are going to shift the nation's attitude a little bit further into appreciating, bringing up children, etc, and not see it as a burden, the language that we use becomes very important, and it needs to be managed consistently at the same time.</p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 715<p><p style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp; On a last note, I would like to perhaps encourage all my fellow colleagues to perhaps read this book called 'A Bitch in the House'.&nbsp; I have forgotten the authoress.&nbsp; Excuse the language, it is the title.&nbsp; The very first page - even if one does not go beyond - spells out clearly the dilemma that faces a wife from a dual income family who is trying to manage a wonderful career, and&nbsp;who is also trying to manage a wonderful home life.&nbsp; I think that kind of insight needs to be internalised beyond the lip service that sometimes we give to this whole concept.&nbsp; And I think the Government is now on the right track in looking for longer term solutions.</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

dramatic changes or surprises.&nbsp; Indeed, the focus of the Budget shifted somewhat to babies, about growing population because of a very serious decline in birth rate.&nbsp; And this is right because it is a long-term problem and we need to address it early because, without people, we cannot hope to achieve or sustain a vibrant economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our economy has improved,&nbsp;exports are up, business profits are up, also employment.&nbsp; The mood is definitely much more cheerful and&nbsp;optimistic, compared to what was the mood just not so long ago which is all gloom and doom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Budget 2004 brought cheer to the business community with the 2% tax cut.&nbsp; It was expected, but it is still appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget 2004 also brought cheer to, I would say,&nbsp;several&nbsp;important sectors of our economy, such as financial services, hub services and also for entrepreneurs.&nbsp; Incentive measures have been targeted at these&nbsp;sectors.&nbsp; All these are very much in line with making our business and investment environment that much more competitive and I think here it is noteworthy to record the Government leading by example by cutting its own expenditure.&nbsp; Although some have said that perhaps 2% is not enough, it is a sure start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose individuals might not be so happy because there is no tax cut for them yet, but the commitment remains there.&nbsp; There is also no increase, in terms of personal reliefs, although a lot of calls have been made in the past to get this much more realistic and also in line with actual living expenses.&nbsp; It would have been nice for them not to feel left out, perhaps with the 1% tax cut and this would have increased disposable income <p align=left>Column: 717<p>and high pub consumption and also lift up optimism which itself is a great multiplier component in any economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tone of the Budget 2004 is considered cautious and conservative.&nbsp; It could have been a bit bolder.&nbsp; We say this because the economy is looking up and the last three years'&nbsp;budget deficits have been smaller and calls for a bit of minor celebration here.&nbsp; And really, it does present a wonderful opportunity to push ahead with the remaining recommendations of the Economic Review Committee.&nbsp; I say this because it also represents, in part, a bit of entrepreneur there.&nbsp; The Government has been calling on all Singaporeans to be much more entrepreneurial, to dare to take the risk, and I think this culture ought to&nbsp;pervade all levels of society, including the democrats perhaps.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I would like to touch on&nbsp;specific elements of the Budget 2004 for consideration for future refinement and extension.&nbsp; Firstly, corporate tax.&nbsp; The 2% cut is certainly welcomed although it was expected, as I said earlier on.&nbsp; I think the business community never for once took it for granted that it would be implemented.&nbsp; So the Government kept to its word and this sends out a very important signal about the serious intent on the part of the Government to keep the business environment competitive.&nbsp; So that is very important.&nbsp; And now, the discussion is about:&nbsp;what's next?&nbsp; Should it go down to 17 1/2%, like Hong Kong?&nbsp; Or should it be lower like 15%?&nbsp; My own view is that we should not keep a closed mind about future options.&nbsp; That is said.&nbsp; We need to know and that is&nbsp;the general feeling of the business community as well that&nbsp;our tax regime, taken as a whole, without looking into specific measures, is one of the most attractive in the world.&nbsp; So there is a limit as to how low the tax rate can be.&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly do not want to emulate other countries with huge long-term budget deficits.&nbsp; And, also, although <p align=left>Column: 718<p>low tax rates are important to keep costs low, there is also the other political as well as economic consideration.&nbsp; Here, I would just like to say that, let us keep our minds open and evaluate the situation as and when necessary.&nbsp; Let us not make 20% a sacred cow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reduction of withholding tax from 15% to 10% is definitely viewed as a very significant step, and another sacred cow being slaughtered.&nbsp; Withholding tax is meant for foreign parties selling goods and services to Singapore.&nbsp; However, invariably, this gets picked up by the Singapore party, making the acquisition of technology and know-how that much more expensive.&nbsp; So the cutting of withholding tax on royalty for the right of use of technology and intellectual property is certainly a step in the right direction.&nbsp; However, more can be done.&nbsp; And this is one instance where I feel that the Government could have gone a bit further and extend the withholding tax for payments on other areas like interests, rentals and other services as well,&nbsp; because this will make it, from the point of view of business, a lot more lower.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would also be helpful if the definition of \"royalty\" can be clarified.&nbsp; Because it would appear that the treatment for payment&nbsp;of information and know-how can be treated differently from payment for use of services in connection with information and know-how.&nbsp; I think the two are so interlinked that they should both enjoy the same reduced tax rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another related area concerns the writing down allowance of intellectual property rights (IPRs).&nbsp; Businesses were also hoping for a relaxation, in terms of criteria, in situations where a taxpayer is not the legal owner, but certainly it is the economic owner of the intellectual property right for an agreed period of time.&nbsp; Before I leave intellectual property rights, I&nbsp;might as well say that, the<p align=left>Column: 719<p> writing down allowance claim is for three proprietaries.&nbsp; But in case of tangible capital assets, it is from one to three.&nbsp; I think both intellectual property rights, as well as capital equipment, are both essential in the manufacturing process to generate income and&nbsp;perhaps this discrepancy ought to be closed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on to entrepreneurs, I think they ought to be feeling happy.&nbsp; Previously, I have spoken of the need to recognise the value for all types of industries and not just high-tech.&nbsp; So it is nice to see that this is being taken on.&nbsp; It is great to see many of our industries, in recent years, and they are not necessarily high-tech, they are in fact low-tech or no-tech engaged in fish-balls, <I>popiah</I> skins, and so on, making their mark in the regional as well as the global arena.&nbsp; All these industries were classified sunset, and I suppose they knew better. &nbsp;From the regional and global perspective, the sun never set for them.&nbsp; It is also good that some of these industries are engaged in products which Singapore does not&nbsp;have a competitive advantage, like the selling of sofa, leather tanning, when we do not have the capital industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, also, in terms of beating the Japanese in the <I>sushi</I> game,&nbsp;with very innovative ideas like the portable conveyor belts.&nbsp;&nbsp;So kudos to our entrepreneurs for their resourcefulness as well as their creativity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is&nbsp;a really welcomed factor&nbsp;that Technopreneur Investment Incentive is now known as the Enterprise Investment Incentive which captures all enterprises, all start-ups, not just high-techs.&nbsp; This&nbsp;really is a&nbsp;great leap forward, in terms of our promotion of piling up the entrepreneurship spirit.&nbsp; Not only that, it represents a shift in mindset, not directing business in a particular direction but actually encouraging individual investors to believe in what they do and to carry on&nbsp;what they do best as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 720<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other incentives for entrepreneurs are also noteworthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned, the three-year tax exemption, in terms of taxable income up to $100,000, will free up valuable financial resources to be reinvested&nbsp;in terms of upgrading as well as regional expansion.&nbsp; Here is another area which I feel that the Government could have been a little bit more generous because, in the early years, a typical setup would have very lean profits, or, in fact, losses as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it is great that a lot of incentives have been introduced for entrepreneurs, for example, the idea of loan securitisation is a good one too.&nbsp; Because it is about funding and this is one of the challenges that entrepreneurs have long talked about.&nbsp; And talking about that, I would like to raise the issue of fund-raising expenses.&nbsp; This can be very significant, be it&nbsp;mortgaging your house to raise funds, be it a public share offering, or in the case of issuance of bonds to raise funds.&nbsp; Businesses here, again, have been calling for these expenses to be tax deductible in order to lessen the burden on fund raising.&nbsp; Perhaps, the Finance Minister could kindly take this into consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On hub incentives, these are commendable.&nbsp; The maximum duration for regional headquarters incentives has been extended from three to five years.&nbsp; I see this as a very significant measure in attracting regional SMEs to locate in Singapore as well as for our own SMEs to go regional and then global.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, likewise the extension of the Pioneer Incentives from 10 years to 15 years, I think, is a very timely move, in the case of MNCs moving out of Singapore.&nbsp; And this will help to keep them here, it is not just about buying time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will also encourage MNCs to upgrade their activities into higher value-added activities.&nbsp; Besides, it will also encourage projects with long gestation&nbsp;to <p align=left>Column: 721<p>locate in Singapore.&nbsp; So both these incentives will help Singapore position itself as a hub for manufacturing and services.&nbsp; Because to be an effective hub, we need a wide corporate base.&nbsp; So we need to attract more companies to Singapore as well as to continue to retain those companies already rooted here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like to move on to financial services because this is of great interest to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy that in fact this received most attention, except that it has got obscured by the babies.&nbsp; Budget 2004 introduced many incentives in the financial services sector.&nbsp; I agree with the Economic Review Committee's recommendation</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

So, we cannot rest on the notion that our competitors will not go up the value chain and also do this business now or in the near future.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am much more optimistic about wealth management.&nbsp; Although it will not create a great deal of employment, it does involve very highly skilled and very&nbsp;competent professionals, and it will spur the financial services industry and bring about spin-offs in terms of other benefits.&nbsp; I am optimistic because&nbsp;the new set of incentives which has been introduced has really broadened the criteria under which investors can qualify for tax exemption.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to record this sector's appreciation of the tax exemption which has been introduced to exempt all foreign-sourced income received in Singapore by resident individuals.&nbsp; This will really help encourage the flow of funds back into Singapore and create a dynamic&nbsp;fund as well as wealth management industry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I would like to comment on babies as a mother,&nbsp;working professional and woman.&nbsp; But much has already been<p align=left>Column: 722<p> said, and it is a bit of a non-event because the incentives have not been announced.&nbsp; We will have to wait until National Day to hear about them.&nbsp; As Ms Braema Mathiaparanam said, this is a refreshing change, I suppose because this affords a wonderful opportunity for the Government to receive feedback as well as suggestions.&nbsp; Much has already been given, and I would like to reiterate some of the points made.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important to recognise the problems of affordability and about how burdensome it is to raise children.&nbsp; Put it that way, it does not sound very nice.&nbsp; And also the problems of beyond tax incentives, of how to make work easier and also less stressful for the couples.&nbsp; In particular, I would like more attention or help being put in the way of infant care as well as after-school care.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to join in the discussion on abortion as well.&nbsp; I am told that we have the highest rate for abortion in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, Mr Lim Hng Kiang, is already shaking his head, which obviously means that I have had my facts wrong.&nbsp; But, be that as it may, it is a high figure.&nbsp; We have a target of some 40% increase to achieve, and that is not easy.&nbsp; Perhaps, it would be useful to review this area to see how much of the baby stork we can save.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, I look forward to listening to Mr Lim Hng Kiang's&nbsp;proposals, come August.&nbsp; For the time being, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Finance for a very positive set of measures which will help us steer ourselves towards a much brighter future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

We have&nbsp;just heard the voice of business earlier&nbsp;from hon.&nbsp;Member, Mrs Fang Ai Lian.&nbsp; Allow me to talk a little about strong society from the socio-economic point of view.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, Sir, this is the right Budget for the right time.&nbsp;To agree with that statement, one needs to see the Budget in the context of what has been offered and achieved by way of the few previous&nbsp;budgets, particularly since the financial crisis of the late 90s.&nbsp; For those who look at the Budget in anticipation of more personal goodies, I agree with some of the feedback I have heard from my grassroots that it did not provide much excitement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For me, DPM's reminder and call for Singaporeans to reaffirm our fundamental for Singapore's survival and success and to make Singapore a Land of Opportunity are indeed exciting.&nbsp; I hope DPM's and the&nbsp;Government's thinking on such guiding principles will continue to fire the imagination of today's Singaporeans and that of succeeding generations, to carry on and to keep that torch burning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, after two decades of fast-track growth, the last six years after the 1997 financial crisis have been rather humbling.&nbsp; It is like the lyrics of the <I>Hokkien</I> song \"<I>ai piah zia ay yiah: wusi ki, wusi lo</I>\".&nbsp; For those who do not understand <I>Hokkien</I>, it means, \"It can go up, it can also come down.\"&nbsp; The residents in my constituency, however, get even more excited when the words are sung as \"<I>wusi ki, buay sai lok</I>\", ie, can go up but cannot go down, although reality tells us that the former is normally true.&nbsp; I am glad, however, that the song believes that it is 70% hard work that matters, and that it is only 30% \"<I>sa hun ti chu tia</I>\", meaning luck or fate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, one thing we do not want to leave to luck is manpower planning, as <p align=left>Column: 724<p>our human capital is one key resource we have to do our best to develop.&nbsp; Thus, I see the Government's intentions to raise university fees with some concern.&nbsp; So do I worry about healthcare affordability in our efforts to build a strong society, what more a greying one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree that a strong society is marked by a high degree of self-reliance, resilience and social responsibility.&nbsp; This, I call the Singapore Spirit.&nbsp; I also agree with DPM that \"the migrants from China, India and the Malay archipelago who built modern Singapore relied on themselves, their families, and their communities to make a living against great odds\".&nbsp; This, indeed, will have to continue to be the trump call, even more so for those lagging behind, as the world gets more competitive.&nbsp; Local communities and the people sector indeed had launched a variety of self-help initiatives and played an important role in society.&nbsp; DPM's call for more of such initiatives, I am sure, will be heeded, including by the CDCs and the public sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, I appeal to the Government not to rush into asking undergraduates to pay a bigger share of the cost of university education.&nbsp; It is already high.&nbsp; Tertiary education is no longer the enclave of the privileged.&nbsp; In my days, an exclusive 5% benefits from university education.&nbsp; Now, it is more than 25%.&nbsp; Is it really true to say that the benefits of a university education accrue mostly to the individual?&nbsp; Not only do they end up contributing more to the country's coffers,&nbsp;more often than not they help to bring up their immediate families' economic well-being, thus helping the economy too.&nbsp; While DPM's assurances that no one needs to miss a tertiary education because of financial reasons are well-received, in reality, the number of bursaries and scholarships is limited.&nbsp; Loans are also tight and, when made available, often hang like a psychological<p align=left>Column: 725<p> burden on the heads of the fresh undergraduates and their families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would not be surprised if that also contributes to the larger concern to delay having their babies, let alone to have more bundles of joy when discharging loans still unpaid.&nbsp; If fees need to go up, requiring more to resort to loans, perhaps the Government could also consider allowing an incentive scheme where those graduates with such loans who marry early and have children would benefit from the baby bonus schemes, eg, a rebate on their outstanding loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But dollars and cents aside,&nbsp; I agree with the hon. Member Mr David Lim that it is very much a question of emotions.&nbsp; The passion for having more children must be there before any policy to promote a more productive TFR rate could succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mayor Othman was right that the Mayors generally have set a good example on this score.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayor Heng is still young, and there is still hope.&nbsp; As the Government needs to set a good example on policy implementation, I suppose it is also right to hope that the younger married MPs should also set the example.&nbsp; I do not know about Mr Lim Hng Kiang, but younger Ministers, too, of course!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was Editor of <I>Berita Harian</I>, I used to write editorials to persuade my readers to stop at two, as the situation then warranted such a policy.&nbsp; Personally, however, I felt that I could afford and should have more.&nbsp; I am now blessed with four lovely children.&nbsp; In fact, I used to encourage my Malay and non-Malay professional friends to have at least four children.&nbsp; But, mind you, people used to stare at my wife and myself when we walked with our four kids.&nbsp; Perhaps, they see us&nbsp;as anti-socials!&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, they say we have foresight!&nbsp; But I must say that it was not easy to have three or more kids, especially for the wife.&nbsp; It is easy to talk about shared responsibilities in bringing up<p align=left>Column: 726<p> families, but reality is different.&nbsp; Of course, we must do more to bring about this sense of shared responsibilities, as this will also be an important factor whether we succeed in promoting bigger family size.&nbsp; And it is more than just a question of affordability.&nbsp; It is also about quality of life, the pressures and demands on our time, and whether we could provide the kind of time necessary to ensure quality time for the family.&nbsp; Like other Members of the House, I also empathise with Mr Lim's unenviable task, but I am sure Minister Lim will not leave any stone unturned to ensure that this fundamental about procreation and a better replacement rate is a success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a different note, Sir, while we want to generally promote more babies, we must also be careful not to send the wrong signal to those whom we feel would best provide a fighting chance for their families to make good, if they keep their families small.&nbsp; For those who are already struggling to make ends meet, for the sake of the future of their children and themselves, there is HOPE&nbsp;which we are trying to promote, and where an important consideration is still to stop at two.&nbsp; Perhaps the Government could also review this policy and consider whether those with three children could also benefit from the scheme, thus - excuse the expression - killing two birds with one stone through HOPE Plus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, Sir, an area of concern hanging like dark clouds on Singaporean minds is the question of healthcare cost.&nbsp; Feedback I get from the ground is that they are very reassured that the Government and DPM Lee care about keeping healthcare cost affordable.&nbsp; They cited the escalating cost of medical care, like the example DPM mentioned about angioplasty with stents, as cause for concern, with cost rising very fast, and, worse too, if there were complications.&nbsp; We are told that only 5% of cases end up with complications but, knowing how<p align=left>Column: 727<p> <I>kiasu</I> Singaporeans can be, many would feel it is better to be cautious than to risk high charges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Means testing sounds equitable but, being new, I am glad to see the Government agreeing to \"proceed cautiously\".&nbsp; MOH needs to work out a system that is sustainable and this will be possible with time and experience.&nbsp; The Government must ensure that this means testing will not end up being&nbsp;seen as \"mean\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flexibility must be its test, as services cover a wide range of inpatient care to surgery to specialist outpatient.&nbsp; There is also the need to differentiate from the ordinary observation ward to the ICU, with or without complication, no matter how low the chances of complications surface.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heart-wrenching case of filial children wanting to show gratitude to their father and placing him for observation in class A, ending up with complications and weeks in ICU and a $170,000 bill a year back, would be a case worth looking at.&nbsp; Indeed, for fear of such a situation</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

On a final note, Sir, while it is certainly helpful to boost the Singapore spirit with talk of the land of opportunity, the Government will need to do more to convince Singaporeans that we are still indeed a land of plenty, especially for those who are still out of job and struggling to find alternatives that would keep themselves and their families afloat. We note that while 12,000 jobs were created in the second half of 2003, 30,000 jobs were lost in the first half.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 728<p> The deficit has had a dent on that Singapore spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to call on the Government to work even closer with the people to strengthen that Singapore spirit.&nbsp; That is also a fundamental.&nbsp; It is more than just a question of nuts and bolts and policies.&nbsp; It is also about mending mindsets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the financial policy of the Government.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, DPM Lee, in his Budget Statement, said that Singapore's declining&nbsp;birth rate is a serious problem.&nbsp; Today,&nbsp;I would like to beseech this House to deliberate on my suggestions for specific pro-natalist schemes and to request DPM Lee to favour such incentives to improve the environment for Singaporeans to raise a family.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Total Fertility Rate, or TFR, in Singapore has reached the lowest level in 25 years at 1.26 last year. TFR has been coming down over the years and has remained below the replacement level since 1977.&nbsp; Sir, this trend is threatening&nbsp;the survival of our nation. The repercussions may be felt sooner with a lessened labour force,&nbsp;insufficient working population to maintain the prosperity of the country and an aging population.&nbsp; With our present immigration policy, such a dismal picture will reduce the resident population with consequential social implications.&nbsp; If this trend is not arrested, the population will start to peak in just a few decades and then Singaporeans will start dying out.&nbsp;&nbsp;While marriage and family sizes are private matters, our Government has no alternative but to try and reverse the dismal threatening trend to address the larger important societal consequences as a country.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have expressed scepticism that no matter what Government does, it is going to be a losing battle as this trend, in <p align=left>Column: 729<p>today's affluent society, is already too entrenched for various reasons and therefore cannot be reversed. Sir, I beg to differ for the following reasons:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp; Singapore's procreation incentives appear to have had some effect in the early days of its introduction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp; A recent study that polled more than 1,200 Singaporeans from housewives to professional working women of varying ages, races and educational levels, showed that the number of children they really desired was significantly higher&nbsp;at 2.7 children, while the women surveyed had small families with an average of 1.9 children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp; The study on social attitudes towards the family carried out in 2001 found that 84% of Singaporeans aged 15 and above agreed that it is better to be married than to remain single while 89% agreed that married couples should have children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) &nbsp;Some northern European countries, with generous pro-family policies and Government handouts, have higher TFR. For example, Denmark has a Total Fertility Rate of 1.7, compared to most countries on the southern rim of Europe, such as Italy and Spain that have some of the lowest TFR on the continent of about 1.2.&nbsp; The governments of the southern countries provide much less child-related allowances than the Nordic countries.&nbsp; It is noteworthy that the northern countries&nbsp;have some of the highest fertility rates in Europe, despite the fact that the proportion of women in their labour force is also among the highest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August 2000, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, PM Goh noted that it might not be possible to reverse the downward trends of marriage and birth rates, as they reflect urbanisation and changing norms, and he said and I quote, \"But we must at least try to arrest the problem,\" stressing that,<p align=left>Column: 730<p> \"not to try is to give up on Singapore\".&nbsp; I am glad that DPM Lee had also said in January this year that he listed the low birth rate as one of the Government's top three priorities.&nbsp; I also agree with DPM Tan's call for a \"total\" solution to this problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to be successful this time, all aspects of conducive factors in raising a family should be considered in totality.&nbsp; Although finance is an important factor, it should be coupled with a slew of other considerations for promoting and improving the environment.&nbsp; This includes looking at the emotional, psychological and lifestyle choices of couples that will make any new or enhanced policy work this time.&nbsp; I would like to urge our Government, while retaining the old measures, to boldly implement more schemes with real impact and not as piecemeal gestures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, I would like to recommend the changes in the following 28 areas.&nbsp; Sir, my suggestions will require a strong fiscal stomach and I do hope that our Government will see it as an investment - expensive but unavoidable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Baby Bonus</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are pragmatic people and many have expressed that raising children is costly.&nbsp; Finance has been considered the deterring factor, besides others, for many young couples.&nbsp; Sir, the Baby Bonus Scheme has not stopped falling birth rates and, therefore, there is a need for a review.&nbsp; I would suggest that while retaining the second tier of the Baby Bonus, the first tier payment of cash gifts of the Baby Bonus should be doubled to give it more impact, ie, from $3,000 to at least $6,000 for the second child and from $6,000 to at least $12,000 for the third child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The age at first marriage has risen for women in Singapore.&nbsp; The median age at <p align=left>Column: 731<p>which women turn mums is 30.5.&nbsp; One in three Singapore adults in their early 30s is still single.&nbsp; In line with the high age at marriage, Singapore women also begin childbearing at a relatively older age.&nbsp; In order to improve this trend, the Baby Bonus should be extended to a first child delivered before the age of 28.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a need for extra incentives rather than disincentives for couples to go for the fourth child.&nbsp; Therefore, the Baby Bonus should be extended to a fourth child as well.&nbsp; Whatever valid reasons for not giving incentives for a fourth child should now&nbsp;be sacrificed for a bigger picture.&nbsp;Last year, our Government paid out $38 million in Baby Bonuses.&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, even if this is doubled, it would be worthwhile for the future of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Tax rebate and tax relief</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2003, the female employees made up 44.7% of the total working population. The female labour force participation rate in 2003 was 53.9%, of which about 54% were married women and about 40% of all married couples were dual-earners.&nbsp; DPM Lee said in his Budget Statement that low birth rate problem is more serious for the mothers who are more educated and earn higher incomes.&nbsp; Sir, some existing incentives should therefore be further sweetened to encourage women to continue contributing to the economy for having a family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Special Tax Rebate should be extended from the first to the fourth child starting at $20,000 for the first child to $40,000 for the fourth child.&nbsp; Presently, this rebate only applies to second to fourth child with a cap of $20,000 to be offset against either husband's or wife's income tax liabilities and may be claimed over five years.&nbsp; Taxpayers can claim child relief of $2,000 presently.&nbsp; This<p align=left>Column: 732<p> child relief should be further increased to $5,000 from first to fourth child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In formulating our procreation policy, due consideration should be given to each child born in the case of a multiple pregnancy.&nbsp; Sir, having twins certainly carries double the burden for a couple and they should not be disadvantaged. Also, the Special Tax Rebate is only applied to children from the same marriage. This should be amended to cater to couples that have to remarry for various reasons, following the demise of the spouse, for instance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Childbirth</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working women find it demanding to try to balance a full-time job and motherhood. There is guilt&nbsp;to outsource caring of a child, especially with the newborn babies.&nbsp; This uneasy conscience is a phenomenon of modern parenting that makes having children daunting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it explains why extended maternity and paternity leave, prevalent in Scandinavia, seems to work.&nbsp; In England and many Scandinavian countries, maternity leave is six months and we should similarly extend maternity leave here in Singapore.&nbsp; However, as I believe our people are pragmatic and reasonable, six months would be too idealistic&nbsp;and an increase from the present eight weeks to at least 16 weeks would be more accountable.&nbsp; The extended maternity leave is especially appropriate in lieu of the scarcity of our infant care facilities and because the post-delivery period is fraught with problems and adjustments, besides being a crucial time for mother-baby bonding.&nbsp; In order not to burden the employers, the Government should bear all the expenses for the extra leave and this leave should be extended from first to fourth birth order. Furthermore, I would like to suggest that some, maybe four weeks, of the extra leave can be taken intermittenly, as and when required,<p align=left>Column: 733<p> during the neonatal period.&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this flexibility will certainly exemplify the spirit we want in encouraging flexible working arrangements to facilitate unexpected or urgent childcare needs at different times in the first year.&nbsp; Women should also be assured of their jobs after their maternity leave.&nbsp; Labour force incentives are as important as monetary ones to facilitate women to have children without giving up or losing their jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, Medisave can only be used to pay for delivery and hospital charges after the third child.&nbsp; This should be extended to the fourth child.&nbsp; The present higher public hospital accouchement fees should also be removed for a third and fourth child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Childcare</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, childcare concerns are a top worry for many couples. Especially in Singapore, children are precious to parents and they want to give them the best care and nurture.&nbsp; Working parents need more support in childcare arrangements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are less than 24 childcare facilities, which offer infant care for babies younger than 18 months.&nbsp; More efforts have to be made in this area to rectify this anomaly quickly.&nbsp; In providing such centres, the infants' needs, such as the necessity of a constant mother figure, should be a consideration.&nbsp; Childcare incentives for working mothers should be subsidised to 75% of the fees charged by centres to give parents more options.&nbsp; The present subsidy of $150 is too little especially&nbsp;for infant care that costs $700 to $1,200 per month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Childcare incentives should also be extended to&nbsp;grandparents, nannies and relatives who have been supervised and certified by MCDS. Sir, this will give<p align=left>Column: 734<p> couples the choice of homecare for their children and will provide the elderly or housewives income&nbsp;while staying at home.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better childcare centres staffed with certified professionals and dedicated carers will give peace of mind to parents who now want professional care for their children. There should be more childcare centres conveniently located in relation to either the home or the workplace.&nbsp; This, in effect, calls for employers to consider providing childcare centres at the workplace.&nbsp; In this respect, Sir,&nbsp;I hope more generous grants&nbsp;be given to companies to set up childcare centres at workplaces.&nbsp; The present $26,000 is too small an amount as set-up cost, especially for those providing childcare centres in accordance with MCDS' guidelines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Family-friendly work environment</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1990 <I>Singapore Census</I> showed that 40% of all married couples are dual-income earners.&nbsp; Many dual-income earners have difficulty in balancing work and family due to the lack of conducive working environment and this causes the lower fertility. Working women find it stressful to juggle between inflexible work schedules and family given that both roles are equally intensive and time-consuming. The recent study that polled 1,200 Singaporean women showed that they preferred to take on a full-time housewife's role or engage in part-time work, which suggests that they found the pull of home stronger than workplace.</p></P></span></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>Almost&nbsp;four in 10 mothers polled preferred not to work at all, a third chose part-time work and only a quarter, the more highly educated women, wanted to continue working full-time.&nbsp; All these indicate that family-friendly work arrangements must have the top priority of attention to help the career-minded or working couples balance their commitments and stay in the workforce.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 735<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the United States has never tried reshaping the birth rate or pushing any population policy, yet its fertility rate of 2.1 is the highest for the industrialised countries.&nbsp; The US has accommodated the need for two-earner families better in many ways than European countries.&nbsp; The experiences of family-friendly firms in the US have been that they reap productivity&nbsp; gains, better customer service, higher staff retention rates, reduction in recruitment and training costs and a drop in absenteeism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although our Government has set up a Work-Life Unit under the MCDS to promote family-friendly practices among employers, more has to be done in terms of tangible incentives such as grants and tax incentives for companies to adopt family-friendly policies for their employees.&nbsp; Sir, many employers expect their employees to attach greater priority to the company and demand that their employees spend as much time as needed at work, even beyond office hours.&nbsp; Complaints have been heard that employers are not happy when their employees are expecting and taking time off for antenatal check-ups and maternity leave.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, only 3% of the Singapore work-force is on part-time work compared&nbsp;to 24% in the UK, 23% in Japan and 17% in US.&nbsp; Less than 2% of workers have flexible work hours compared to 28%&nbsp;in US, 12% in the UK and 8.7% in Japan.&nbsp; I would like to beseech our Government to really do a lot more to facilitate flexible work option and family-friendly working environment.&nbsp; Presently, there is a dearth of flexibility in work arrangements especially for professionals.&nbsp; Teleworking has not taken off.&nbsp; There is also not enough assistance and training for women to re-enter employment after being away for a while.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 736<p><p><I>Stressful education</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The study by Dr Stella Quah of National University of Singapore on the Singapore Family revealed that the greatest worry for about 45% of them came from the problems associated with their children's education.&nbsp; Sir, Singaporean parents have also frequently mentioned children's education as the contributory factor in opting for smaller families.&nbsp; A study in 1999 on pupils' stress showed that pupils' stress in terms of overload had increased since 1990.&nbsp; The Ministry of Education should strive for a less stressful education while developing a child's potential.&nbsp; I think it is time that our Ministry of Education reviewed and effected some changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary education streaming should be scrapped to reduce the stress for pupils and parents for primary level.&nbsp; This will also address the fact that there are late developers that may be disadvantaged from early streaming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Principals must ensure that teachers do not overload pupils with homework and tests.&nbsp; More emphasis should be given to better teaching resources to make education in schools interesting.&nbsp; Better parent-teacher rapport and feedback are needed to monitor pupils' progress and family stress from education.&nbsp; There is also the need to provide teacher-counsellors and professional counsellors.&nbsp; There must be guidance on supportive parenting and the prevention of parents pushing their children to achieve beyond their ability and to avoid parents' stress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many parents turn to private tuition for their children.&nbsp; It will be a good idea if our schools provide tutorial classes after normal school hours, not for giving the children extra work, but for helping them cope with their \"homework\", to free the children to spend quality time at home with their parents.&nbsp; Another way to help&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 737<p>parents, especially working parents, is to organise the extra-curricular pursuits, like learning drama, piano,&nbsp;ballet, and so on, collectively, after classes in the schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;This will save parents having to ferry their children to and from different places for these hobbies, and this will also help Singaporean parents save much time, effort and money.&nbsp; Let us make our schools, especially our primary schools, more holistic and comprehensive in nature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The criteria for the ranking of schools need to be expanded to lessen the emphasis on academic achievements and grade scores.&nbsp; More weightage should be on other markers relevant to the present times.&nbsp; Thus, ranking should take attainments in developing the potential of students in information technology, sports and the arts into consideration.&nbsp; Schools should be ranked by bands, rather than individually.&nbsp; Sir, the lessened emphasis on how individual schools fared on the O-level results just recently is welcome indeed, and I hope MOE will further ease individual school ranking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having flexibility in school and university entry criteria, such as considering the non-academic ability, will lessen the stress from many students and parents.&nbsp; Parents can then be more relaxed to allow their children develop their own unique potential though it may not conform to the norm.&nbsp; Universities should not be too fixated on accepting students with a string of straight A's and there should be more flexibility and some open-mindedness in student admission.&nbsp; The Second Language ruling for varsity and independent criteria for university acceptance announced recently were commendable and a good start, and I hope to see more favourable criteria expanded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we do have to convince Singaporeans that success does not come from just highest academic achievements <p align=left>Column: 738<p>alone.&nbsp; There must be more definitions of success.&nbsp; For instance, one can be considered a success also from being well-trained and qualified in the vocations.&nbsp; The Government must also show the example by not just selecting and promoting people in the civil service with the highest academic qualifications alone, but also with other and different criteria.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Mindset change</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a need for a change of attitude in parenting towards \"Happy Parenting\".&nbsp; There had been too many negative reports and negative emphases on parenthood.&nbsp; We need to start an aggressive campaign to correct this negative mindset.&nbsp; I remember the publicity on \"Stop at Two\" campaign in the past, which was so intensely carried out that I was bombarded with that message every single day.&nbsp; Sir, that had left an imprint in my brain till today and I can still see that message in my head.&nbsp; Now, aggressive affirmative publicity should be on happy parenthood.&nbsp; The emphasis on campaigning should be on the joy that family brings such as the great feeling to hear the little ones saying \"Mum\", \"Dad\" and \"I love you\", and the happiness the first time you hold your newborns.&nbsp; The slogan, Sir, could be, \"The more in the family to share your life with, the merrier it is\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, women assume the main responsibility of housework and childcare,&nbsp;regardless whether they are employed.&nbsp; Working women are often stressed from the multiple responsibilities.&nbsp; Research into marital satisfaction among Singaporean women showed a direct correlation between stress levels in women and the amount of help they get at home.&nbsp; Traditionally, the father had been the sole breadwinner and the distant disciplinarian while the mother was the nurturer and homemaker.&nbsp; In the present dual-income family, there should be a shift towards this perception of the roles of <p align=left>Column: 739<p>fathers and mothers.&nbsp; Parenting and homemaker tasks should be shared between spouses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Government can promote this mindset by increasing the paternity leave from&nbsp;three days to 10 days with full pay borne by the State in order not to burden companies.&nbsp; This will send a strong signal that men are responsible too for the care and upbringing of a child.&nbsp; More effort in this area will be useful, such as giving further incentives for companies and having a campaign to change the stereotyped mindset of many men regarding their roles in parenting and household responsibilities, and the need for them to be equal partners in raising families.&nbsp; Sir, a good marriage needs time and commitment to nurture and sustain and can be very time-intensive.&nbsp; Unfortunately, employees lack time due to the demands from work.&nbsp; Therefore, family-oriented working environment will help employees, especially for young couples.&nbsp; A campaign on family-friendly practices to be adopted by companies as good investments with profitable returns should be stepped up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is a need to inspire the young with a deeper sense of individual responsibility towards the family.&nbsp; Basic social etiquette and interpersonal skills should be taught and promoted.&nbsp; This will lead to our young being better equipped with skills in handling boy-girl relationship, marriage, parental responsibility, and so on.&nbsp; Such \"values\" transmission can be done through teachers in schools, through a parent-school-community partnership, through religious and community groups and through the media.&nbsp; Facilitating and providing avenues for young people to come together in the schools, polytechnics, universities, workplaces, community centres and so on will give them the opportunity to intermingle with peers within their cohorts.&nbsp; Government<p align=left>Column: 740<p> should provide funding and incentives to facilitate this avenue for young people.&nbsp; This opportunity may not be there once they start their working life.&nbsp; There is a general tendency for the younger people in our workforce to put off courtship, marriage and childbearing to very much later on in their lives.&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, parents and young people should abandon the mindset that students should not court until they have graduated and are established in their careers because by then it becomes increasingly difficult to interact and to start courting.&nbsp; Young people would be well advised to be responsible adults who are accountable in relationship, responsible towards others and sensible in pursuing studies simultaneously with a relationship without jeopardising one or the other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been noted that&nbsp;one in&nbsp;five single British men and women is turning to dating agencies and personal advertisements to start relationship; confirming a trend researchers have found that modern lifestyle and job demands are killing traditional courtship.&nbsp; Sir, credible web-sites run by our Government agencies or reputable private organisations that ensure correct and certified data of individuals will be useful.&nbsp; I believe that, in the IT era, this channel will prove to be the preferred choice for many of our IT savvy and busy young people to acquaint and befriend each other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the trend is for Singapore families to get smaller, extended families will not be the norm soon.&nbsp; And, since they are all working, many will become too busy for interaction with families and friends.&nbsp; Such a trend, Sir, is bad and must be addressed.&nbsp; Strengthening family ties, better bonding with extended families and neighbourliness are areas worth cultivating.&nbsp; Community-based organisations should organise more activities in grassroots programmes to promote these virtues.&nbsp; Our CDCs, CCCs, CCMCs,<p align=left>Column: 741<p> RCs and Town Councils should actively promote and support more of such activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Medical</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I would like to touch on the medical aspects of procreation.&nbsp; In Singapore,&nbsp;one in&nbsp;five women has kids when she is 35 years old or older.&nbsp; Sir, this figure far exceeds the developed world average.&nbsp; Pregnancy in older&nbsp;women carries increased risks for mums and babes; these include miscarriages, pregnancy complications and complicated deliveries.&nbsp; Publicity and promotion of earlier childbearing age should be done extensively to educate the public on the medical disadvantages of pregnancies in older women.&nbsp; MOH can promote this message through the Health Promotion Board or in collaboration with other organisations.&nbsp; I have suggested for more risk-pooling insurance schemes for medical expenses, and maternity insurance should be provided for from our Medisave to insure couples for complications of pregnancies, childbirths and premature babies that can incur financial burdens to young couples.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prevalence of infertility in Singapore is high.&nbsp;&nbsp;One in&nbsp;five married couples finds it difficult to conceive.&nbsp; More should be done to help these couples in their dilemma.&nbsp; We should re-look ways of assisting and increasing fertility success such as in the funding of existing non-profitable fertility enhancement centres and the funding of sperm and ova banks.&nbsp; The Medisave withdrawal for in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) should not be capped anymore and we should allow the use of Medisave for up to at least three treatment cycles and facilitate infertile couples to afford the expensive treatment.&nbsp; Sir, in 1987, the one-week sterilisation paid-leave was removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that now we should have a replacement of such leave as one-week procreation leave<p align=left>Column: 742<p> borne by the Government to facilitate expecting&nbsp;mothers to attend antenatal check-ups in the early stages of pregnancy and to allow infertile couples to seek treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the past, we often heard our Government asking our people to bite the bullet and take the painful measures.&nbsp; Today, in conclusion, I call on our Government to respond and take the bitter fiscal measures to save our nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><!--MP_NAME:Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>the number of MPs who have been and will be&nbsp;rising to speak on various aspects of the subject.&nbsp; I do not propose to go into a comprehensive listing of measures that I may have to suggest, as these have already been amply covered by many hon. colleagues.&nbsp; I would, however, like to bring up a couple of areas of concern.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DPM Lee spoke of the need for a holistic and coherent approach, of looking for long-term solutions, and of the need for patiently working on changing attitudes and mindsets.&nbsp; Unfortunately, even as he said this, the principles he set out for guiding Government's thinking on the subject displayed the prevalence of <p align=left>Column: 743<p>some ongoing distinctly old mindsets, in particular the singling out again of the better educated higher income women as a group needing special attention and incentives.&nbsp; I would venture to say, however, that with our fertility rate at an all time low of 1.26, we should be desperate enough&nbsp;to depart from this constant focus only on our better educated women.&nbsp; It is a simple matter of mathematics -&nbsp;we really need every woman in the reproductive age group encouraged to consider having babies, not just those with secondary education and above.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a fallacy to think that the higher educated mothers need more attention.&nbsp; Experience elsewhere has shown that companies are much more accommodating to higher skilled women with regard to good work-life balance programmes and schemes, and it is the lower skilled ones who have difficulty accessing any degree of flexibility of accommodation of their needs. Also, lower educated and lower income couples are the ones for whom two incomes in the family are a necessity, and the availability and affordability of childcare and other support and arrangements are a real problem.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making a distinction between lower and higher educational groups is alienating and, I think, counter-productive.&nbsp; We have already, in the past, targeted incentives at the better educated women.&nbsp; Now, rather than repeating the refrain, perhaps we should simply make sure instead that the children from lower income households have indeed every opportunity in our society to make good, with universal access to education, financial and other assistance&nbsp;where it&nbsp;might be necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the follow-up to the Budget Statement, Minister Lim Hng Kiang, who has the challenging assignment to come<p align=left>Column: 744<p> up with the specific proposals by National Day, shared some preliminary thoughts with regard to some areas that are being looked at, namely, extended maternity leave, child and infant care, work-life balance and financial support.&nbsp; I fully agree with, notably, Deputy Speaker Lim Hwee Hua and Mdm Halimah Yacob's comments with regard to maternity leave and with the need to change mindsets regarding sharing of the responsibility for parenting.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister correctly identified that many working mums feel that our current eight weeks of maternity leave is too short,&nbsp;and leaving the baby at home and returning to work at the end of that period is both wrenching and stressful.&nbsp; But what is the right number of weeks or months? When&nbsp;does child minding or child rearing end?&nbsp; Two options were proposed&nbsp; -&nbsp; four months and six months, with varying levels of pay.&nbsp; I think it is without question that Government will have to pick up the tab, as it would run counter to our efforts to try to keep Singapore attractive as a cost competitive place to do business, to lay that burden directly and upfront on companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the financial impact of extended maternity leave is only one of the tough questions that arises.&nbsp; The second is the issue of disruption to work when an employee is away for, say, six months of maternity leave.&nbsp; Employers and colleagues are likely to view this without much enthusiasm.&nbsp; So, extended maternity leave is a double-edged sword for women, as indeed are other, what might be termed, \"family friendly\" benefits, if these are to be targeted solely at working mums and seen as an accommodation to them.&nbsp; Companies will come to view married women as less desirable employees to have.&nbsp; Unless anti-discriminatory hiring laws are enacted concurrently, extended maternity leave carries significant risks for women that it will come to the detriment of their job and career prospects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 745<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings us to something very fundamental in the equation in the decision process with regard to the number of children couples choose to have.&nbsp; If the burden, so to speak, of adjustment and accommodation falls largely upon women, then in the longer-term, women will still opt to have smaller families or no children at all, simply because the sacrifice called for is more than they are willing to make.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tan Soo Khoon quoted the low fertility rates of Italy and Spain in the context of the extended maternity leave that they have as something to be considered when looking at maternity leave.&nbsp; But there is, in fact, another reason that has been identified as to why these countries in Southern Europe have such poor fertility rates.&nbsp; And that is, in fact, they are very traditional societies with very strong gender stereotyping of roles, and that the women largely bear the burden of all of the various family issues.&nbsp; And this is, mind you, when you take into consideration that they are largely Roman Catholic countries with the prohibition of use of contraception notwithstanding, you still have no luck there with the Southern European countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, this whole issue of sharing of responsibilities of parenting cannot be done away with.&nbsp; And the subject of involvement of fathers in parenting was not touched upon at all either by the DPM or Minister Lim, except that when the latter was asked why paternity leave was not an option proposed, he started laying the groundwork, I suspect, for saying no by listing all the reasons why this was not going to work, even as he said that it was open to the public to give him feedback.&nbsp; If we are to succeed in raising our fertility rate in the long term, we must look at how to involve fathers much more in child minding and child rearing.&nbsp; The job of parenting must be fully shared between mothers and fathers.&nbsp; The perceived <p align=left>Column: 746<p>burden when shared might turn out not to be so burdensome after all.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are growing numbers of Singapore men, I think, who are willing to participate and take responsibility, but we must support and facilitate their taking part in the process of bringing up the kids and taking more responsibility.&nbsp; While this would take much time and effort, to see any significant change in mindsets, all the more reason that the message must be clear and consistent and immediate.&nbsp; We should not be waiting some more to be really making real efforts here.&nbsp; I would therefore go further than Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Mdm Halimah Yacob and, in fact, Dr Lily Neo's suggestion of 10 days of paternity leave.&nbsp; I would propose to the Minister and his committee that should they, in fact, propose extended maternity leave, this indeed be called parental leave instead, and that eligibility for the leave be tied to the father taking one month of the four or six months, not concurrent with his wife for child minding.&nbsp; And it should be a case that if dad does not use it, the couple loses it.&nbsp; So, it is mandatory that if they want the parental leave, father should be involved as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see the looks of disbelief from the Frontbench, but I think it is important to make a start.&nbsp; I believe Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has talked about an educational campaign on shared responsibilities, and I think educational campaigns will only go that far.&nbsp; I think you need to go beyond that and actually push that the dads do participate, and this is one way to get started.&nbsp; I may sound ridiculous to the men in the House, but I think it is important enough and I am willing to sound ridiculous to give it a try.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As child rearing, in fact, does not end at eight weeks, six months, or a year or two even, I am happy to hear that the Government will be looking also into increasing subsidies for child and infant care, as well as exploring other family <p align=left>Column: 747<p>day-care options to address the problem of looking after baby after the period of parental leave is over.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the quality of care provided, the convenience of location of a childcare centre is an important factor.&nbsp; The siting of child and infant care centres at the workplace makes life much more convenient, but comes with a significant price tag and, very often, individual smaller companies especially may not have enough staff with children in the pre-school age to justify setting up such a centre of their own.&nbsp; To address this situation, I had, on occasions in the past, previously appealed to the Minister for National Development to consider requiring developers of business&nbsp;and industrial complexes above a certain size to set aside space for childcare or multi-service centres with rentals kept low, but to no avail.&nbsp; I dare say that MND did not think it their responsibility to help the Singapore stork.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; So, I shall take the opportunity now to redirect my proposal to DPM Lee instead, since he has larger clout, with the hope that this can be included as part of the holistic package of measures to raise our fertility rate.&nbsp; I trust that Minister Lim and his working committee will be able to get all Ministries across the board to take ownership of this effort rather than to dismiss suggestions made to them as not within their remit or interest.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to the issue of childcare centres.&nbsp; It has been brought up in the Minister for National Development's reply in the past that developers would feel rather imposed upon.&nbsp; But if gross floor area exemption could be granted for the space, this would help to ease that problem and they would not then feel so&nbsp;unduly penalised by the requirement.&nbsp; This way, employees of many companies sited within such complexes would have a childcare centre <p align=left>Column: 748<p>conveniently and helpfully located close by.&nbsp; And with their combined numbers, this would make the running of such a centre a viable option.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I move on to comment briefly on a separate subject, I must make an observation that the recent months have seen very encouraging developments in the education system, presenting students with more diversity of routes to tertiary education, easing the pressures related to mastering Chinese language and, most recently, the signalling of the departure from the academic ranking of schools.&nbsp; As the pressures of our education system are invariably featured very high on any listing of the stresses of bringing up a child, I dare say that if this promising trend continues, we may find that the hero in our Singapore baby saga turns out to be the Minister for Education!&nbsp; So, please do keep up this promising trend in terms of the measures to ease the perceived difficulties and challenges that our kids have struggled with in the system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I conclude, moving away from issues on procreation, I have one observation to make with regard to Medisave top-ups for the above 50s.&nbsp; We all appreciate the indication of the importance that Government places on managing healthcare costs and the attention it is paying to the needs of older Singaporeans that&nbsp;this gesture signals.&nbsp; However, my observation is that while the gesture was well intentioned,&nbsp;it is, in fact, not a very good use of the money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we have been saying with regard to means testing, we would like to&nbsp;target Government subsidies to those who need it.&nbsp; The $50 to $200 deposited into the Medisave accounts of those&nbsp;over&nbsp;50s, who need it will, I can assure you, not be enough.&nbsp; The same amount deposited into the Medisave accounts of those over&nbsp;50s who do not need it will be irrelevant, and hence wasted.&nbsp; The $104 million will end up neither providing adequate relief to the<p align=left>Column: 749<p> needy nor even gain much goodwill for the Government in the process.&nbsp; I would therefore like to ask DPM Lee to reconsider and redirect the $104 million to Medifund instead, as this will then indeed be used to give assistance to those who truly need it.</p></P></span></div><!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS--><!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE--><p align=left>Column: 749<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
