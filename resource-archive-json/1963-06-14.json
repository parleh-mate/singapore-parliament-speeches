The  Member   for\r\n\r\nThomson  accused  us of trying to evade  this  issue.\r\n\r\nHere are the facts of the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.K. Tang Ltd, and the Singapore Manual and\r\n\r\nMercantile   Workers   Union  signed   a   collective\r\n\r\nagreement  which  was  certified  by  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration Court on 15th March, 1961. The  agreement\r\n\r\nwas  for  two years, from 15th March, 1961,  to  14th\r\n\r\nMarch, 1963. On 5th December, 1961, that is two years\r\n\r\nago,  the Singapore Business Houses Employees'  Union\r\n\r\nclaimed to represent the majority of the employees of\r\n\r\nC. K. Tang, and this union requested the Commissioner\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  to conduct a secret ballot to  determine\r\n\r\nunion  representation. The Commissioner  for  Labour,\r\n\r\nwho then was Mr Kok Ah Loy and not Mr Pang Tee Pow,\r\n\r\nreferred  this matter to the State Advocate-General's\r\n\r\nChambers  for advice, and the S.A.G.'s Chambers  gave\r\n\r\nadvice  which  I  read  last night.  The  union  was,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  advised  accordingly.  The  matter   then\r\n\r\nrested at that stage without being pursued further by\r\n\r\nthis union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was after two years, that is on 13th March, 1963,\r\n\r\nthat  the  S.B.H.E.U. again took up this matter.  The\r\n\r\npresent  Commissioner for Labour, Mr Pang  Tee  Pow,\r\n\r\nthen told the union that it could not proceed with  a\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot because of legal advice  being  given.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  the  meantime, he  again  referred  the\r\n\r\nmatter    to    the   State   Advocate-General    for\r\n\r\nclarification. The S.A.G.'s Chambers took  some  time\r\n\r\nand  it  was  only  on  30th April,  1963,  that  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Labour was advised  that  he  could\r\n\r\nproceed to hold a secret ballot in cases where  there\r\n\r\nwere certified and registered collective agreements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From then onwards, any dispute on the question of\r\n\r\nrepresentation of unions is always resolved by way of\r\n\r\na  secret ballot. Therefore, a secret ballot was held\r\n\r\nin the C. K. Tang case sometime after April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last night the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nalso made an accusation that the present Commissioner\r\n\r\nfor Labour, Mr Pang Tee Pow, is biased and is acting\r\n\r\non  instructions.  I will reveal to  this  House  the\r\n\r\nfacts  of the other two cases so that the House  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to arrive at a conclusion as to whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  the Commissioner for Labour, as a civil servant,\r\n\r\nreally  acted  on legal advice and according  to  the\r\n\r\nstatute of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the case of the Plywood dispute which hitherto\r\n\r\nhas   had   dealings   with  the  Singapore   General\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union.  On  23rd  February,   1963,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Manual  and  Mercantile   Workers   Union\r\n\r\napproached  the  Commissioner for Labour  to  hold  a\r\n\r\nsecret ballot to determine union representation.  The\r\n\r\nS.M.M.W.U.,  on  23rd  February,  that   is,   before\r\n\r\nclarification  was  given  to  the  Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nLabour on 30th April, also informed this union, which\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson accused as belonging  to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  that no secret ballot could be held  because\r\n\r\nof a legal ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in the case of Seiclene, as late as 16th\r\n\r\nApril,   I  think,  the  S.M.M.W.U. approached   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Labour to hold a secret  ballot  to\r\n\r\ndetermine   union  representation.   Similarly,   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Labour again rejected  the  request\r\n\r\nbecause of the legal ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all these cases pertaining to secret balk: were\r\n\r\nonly  disposed  of after 30th April, 1963, when  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for  Labour was  advised  that,  though\r\n\r\nthere  may  be a certified and registered  collective\r\n\r\nagreement,  a  secret ballot can be  conducted.  From\r\n\r\nthat  date  onwards,  all cases  that  were  held  up\r\n\r\nbecause of this ruling had been disposed of by way of\r\n\r\nsecret ballot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson also\r\n\r\nclaimed  yesterday that the S.A.T.U. group of  unions\r\n\r\nbelieve  in maintaining industrial peace with justice\r\n\r\nthrough  the  machinery of the  Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  I think all the workers know how  sincere\r\n\r\nthe Member for Thomson is with regard to this matter.\r\n\r\nHe   cited  the  case  of  the  dispute  between  the\r\n\r\nS.B.H.E.U. and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFraser  &  Co.  In  this particular case,  the  union\r\n\r\nmanaged    to   reach   agreement   through    direct\r\n\r\nnegotiations  with the employer on all points  except\r\n\r\nthe  clause  on retrenchment. Immediately  after  the\r\n\r\ndeadlock, the union took it upon itself to  lead  the\r\n\r\nworkers to go on strike, instead of adhering  to  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Ordinance which  provided  that\r\n\r\nthe  next  step the union should have  taken  was  to\r\n\r\nnotify  the Commissioner for Labour under section  19\r\n\r\nthat  they had reached a deadlock although  they  had\r\n\r\ndirect   negotiations.  Had  that  been   done,   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  would  have  arranged  for  a   further\r\n\r\nconciliation.  But in this case, the  union  did  not\r\n\r\nresort  to this procedure. They deemed fit to  resort\r\n\r\nto direct action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Industrial Relations Ordinance, there are so\r\n\r\nmany  procedures to go through where  every  facility\r\n\r\nand every assistance and every effort can be made  to\r\n\r\nsettle a dispute. Just now, I referred to section 19.\r\n\r\nUnder  section  19  where the Commissioner  fails  to\r\n\r\neffect  a  conciliation, he could notify the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour  that no further progress could  be  made\r\n\r\nthrough  conciliation.  The  matter  could  then   be\r\n\r\nconsidered by the Minister as to whether it should be\r\n\r\nreferred to arbitration or further conciliation could\r\n\r\nbe  made through his good offices. But no, the  Union\r\n\r\ndid not avail itself of all these facilities. So this\r\n\r\nis  one  of  the classic cases where the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  incited  and misled the  workers  to  go  on\r\n\r\nstrike.  And when he is in a fix, he always puts  the\r\n\r\nblame  on  the  Minister for  Labour  or  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry that we make no attempt to help them resolve\r\n\r\ntheir trade disputes. In this case, though they  went\r\n\r\non  strike, nevertheless our conciliation officer  on\r\n\r\nhis   initiative,  immediately  the  strike  was  on,\r\n\r\napproached both parties to resume negotiations at the\r\n\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case where the S.A.T.U group of unions\r\n\r\ndeliberately by-passed the conciliation machinery and\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial  Relations Ordinance was  the  recent\r\n\r\ndispute  in Singapore Oxygen Ltd. This case  involves\r\n\r\nthe  question  of transfer. The union  took  up  this\r\n\r\nmatter with the management. No progress could be made\r\n\r\nthrough direct negotiations. Immediately after  that,\r\n\r\nthe union\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntook it upon itself to lead the workers to go on\r\n\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in this case, it was the management itself which\r\n\r\nreferred  the  matter  to the Labour  Department  and\r\n\r\nasked  it  to  assist  in effecting  a  conciliation.\r\n\r\nImmediately   upon  this  request,  the  Conciliation\r\n\r\nOffice brought the two parties together and tried  to\r\n\r\nresolve  this  matter.  After several  meetings,  the\r\n\r\ndispute was then resolved on certain terms. Among the\r\n\r\nterms  of  the  settlement arrived at was  that  this\r\n\r\nmatter was to be referred to arbitration. Here again,\r\n\r\nthis  is a matter of interpretation. The union  could\r\n\r\nhave  approached the management and suggested,  after\r\n\r\nthe deadlock, to refer the matter to arbitration. No,\r\n\r\nthey went on strike. So after they went on strike and\r\n\r\nfailed,  they  put  the blame  again  on  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he  was  sincere in  making  use  of  the\r\n\r\nconciliation  machinery and the Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

There is a letter here.\r\n\r\nAfter  the  settlement, the management wrote  to  the\r\n\r\nunion  saying, \"All right, according to our terms  of\r\n\r\nsettlement,   we   are  to  refer  this   matter   to\r\n\r\narbitration.\" The employer asked the union to sign  a\r\n\r\njoint application to refer the matter to arbitration.\r\n\r\nBut  what  was the reply from the union?  They  said,\r\n\r\n\"No,  we  are  not  interested  in  referring  it  to\r\n\r\narbitration.  If  you want to do so,  you  do  it  by\r\n\r\nyourself.\" There you are, Mr Speaker, Sir.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe  conduct  of  this unionist who, in  this  House,\r\n\r\nclaims that he is being deprived of the machinery and\r\n\r\nthat  we  are playing politics in dealing with  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes - [Interruption] These are the facts.  There\r\n\r\nare letters here in the file ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> What did the secretary reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, last night the\r\n\r\nMember  for Thomson also said that we were  deviating\r\n\r\nfrom  our labour policy. The Minister for Labour  had\r\n\r\nin  his reply referred him to our labour policy which\r\n\r\nwe   have   enunciated  in  our  Five-Year   Election\r\n\r\nProgramme. If he verifies from the programme and  the\r\n\r\nwork  we  have  done in the Labour Ministry,  he  can\r\n\r\nhardly  find  anything to show that  we  have  fallen\r\n\r\nshort of our election manifesto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know, of course, that it is a\r\n\r\nwaste  of  time  for us to convince or  persuade  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson to agree that we  have  strictly\r\n\r\nfollowed  our labour policy which we have  enunciated\r\n\r\nin  our election programme. We know that according to\r\n\r\nhim, the means justify the end, that is, even if  the\r\n\r\nworkers  are to be sacrificed or they are to  suffer,\r\n\r\nit  is  immaterial  as long as  he  can  achieve  his\r\n\r\nulterior  motive  by  all these means,  that  is,  to\r\n\r\nintroduce a foreign ideology to this country. Whereas\r\n\r\non  our  side,  Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe  in  our\r\n\r\nbasic  political philosophy and we are  going  to  go\r\n\r\nabout  it by peaceful revolution. Therefore, we state\r\n\r\nthat  that is why there is a basic difference between\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson and our side. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nmachinery  and  the facilities; that prevail  in  the\r\n\r\nState are detrimental to the manner and activities of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Thomson, because you are aware,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that from time to time it is announced\r\n\r\nin  the  paper that workers have left the  S.A.  T.U.\r\n\r\ngroup  of unions and joined the other unions, because\r\n\r\nthe  workers  are fed up with them.  They  have  been\r\n\r\nmisled  and  a classic case was Borneo Motors,  where\r\n\r\ntheir  backroom boy, Mr Lu Shee Peng, fully realised\r\n\r\nthat, in the agreement, the understanding reached was\r\n\r\nthat  the  company would endeavour to pay  an  annual\r\n\r\nbonus  of one month's salary or more within the terms\r\n\r\nof this agreement. This agreement was entered into on\r\n\r\n1st  July,  1961. For the year 1961,  the  union  had\r\n\r\nadvised  the  employees - their members then - to  accept\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of  bonus as stipulated in  the  agreement\r\n\r\nreached.  But in 1962, they deliberately  misled  the\r\n\r\nworkers into believing that they could ask for more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbonus.  All  right, even if they thought they  had  a\r\n\r\ncase  to  do  so, then the proper and  peaceful  way,\r\n\r\nwithout  causing  lot, of suffering to  the  workers,\r\n\r\nwould  be  to  refer this matter to  the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt,  since  this was not a question of  bargaining\r\n\r\nover  the quantum of the rate. It was just a question\r\n\r\nof  interpretation of the clause. But, no. Again  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business Houses Employees' Union  led  the\r\n\r\nworkers  on a strike. After the management had  stood\r\n\r\nfirm and pointed out the legal position of this case,\r\n\r\nthey  then  realised that they had again  misled  the\r\n\r\nworkers. In this case, they forced the workers to  go\r\n\r\nback to work. There is no time for me to read through\r\n\r\nall the circulars put up by the members who were then\r\n\r\nin their union. These members were suddenly then told\r\n\r\nthat  they were expelled. They refused to go back  to\r\n\r\nwork.  They  were asked to call off the strike.  They\r\n\r\nwere first asked to go on strike; the union tried  to\r\n\r\ndeceive  them that there was a case for them  to  ask\r\n\r\nfor more bonus. After the union failed, they realised\r\n\r\nthe  legal  position there and then they  forced  the\r\n\r\nworkers  to  call  off the strike. The  workers  then\r\n\r\nturned  round and said, \"Now, what is this? You  have\r\n\r\nasked  us  to go strike because there is a  case  for\r\n\r\nmore  bonus. How is that you want us to call off  the\r\n\r\nstrike   and  go  back  to  work  without  anything?\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, the workers put up some arguments with the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson. The Member for Thomson knew  that\r\n\r\nit  was  very  embarrassing. The only simple  way  of\r\n\r\ndoing it is, as I have said just now, as long as  the\r\n\r\nmeans  justify  the end, he just cuts them  off.  The\r\n\r\nworkers,   fortunately,   were   conscious   of   the\r\n\r\nconsequences, because the management was  already  on\r\n\r\nthe verge of serving them with notices of termination\r\n\r\nof  services. They immediately approached the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry   for  assistance.  It  was  only   at   our\r\n\r\nintervention that the workers were not made to suffer\r\n\r\nunduly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson also accused us of playing\r\n\r\npolitics in dealing with trade disputes. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   everyone  in  the  Singapore  Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union knows what the Member for Thomson is\r\n\r\naiming at,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  how they are going to make use of them. You will\r\n\r\nremember,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, immediately  after  the\r\n\r\naction  in  February taken by the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil,  the  Singapore Business  Houses  Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion  held a meeting in the Hokkien Huay Kwan.  They\r\n\r\npassed  a resolution, the usual thing, demanding  the\r\n\r\nrelease  of their trade unionists. They printed  this\r\n\r\nresolution  on  paper. Then they  asked  their  usual\r\n\r\nrunners to go to every branch to force them to  sign,\r\n\r\nsaying that they must sign individually, each one  of\r\n\r\nthem,  one  copy  saying  that  they  supported   the\r\n\r\nresolution,  to  show that it was  genuine  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  were up in arms against the Government.  Not\r\n\r\nonly  that, Mi. Speaker, Sir, the workers were  asked\r\n\r\nby  force  to  donate one day's wages to support  the\r\n\r\ndetainees'  families, not by voluntary donations.  It\r\n\r\nwas  by  force, otherwise they would be subjected  to\r\n\r\nintimidation. I have often heard workers who  are  in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore General Employees' Union say,  \"Though\r\n\r\nthe union may have obtained one or two cents increase\r\n\r\nfor me, every month or every now and then, I will  be\r\n\r\nasked  to  contribute  either to  a  strike  fund,  a\r\n\r\nBarisan  rally  or  legal fees. In  the  end  I  have\r\n\r\nsuffered  a  loss  instead of  gain  by  joining  the\r\n\r\nunion.\"  That is a fact. The Member for  Thomson  can\r\n\r\nclarify  it from his own members. There is  a  recent\r\n\r\ncase  of  United Engineers when an old  man  had  the\r\n\r\ncourage to stand up and fight against the chairman of\r\n\r\nhis  own  branch.  He refused to contribute  to  this\r\n\r\nfund,  because he had his own political  convictions.\r\n\r\nHe  said,  \"I  refuse to. I do not  want  to  involve\r\n\r\nmyself  in these political manoeuvres.\" What did  the\r\n\r\nbranch  do?  The  Singapore General Employees'  Union\r\n\r\nused pressure on the employer and forced the old  man\r\n\r\nto be sacked from the firm. This is on record. If the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson wants any time, we can  ask  the\r\n\r\nPress  to hold a Press conference and ask the workers\r\n\r\nto come and reveal the story. That is a fact ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

Of course, in that case,  their\r\n\r\nargument  was  that in 1955, there  was  a  group  of\r\n\r\nworkers  who  were  dismissed. They  said  they  were\r\n\r\nwrongfully dismissed because, at that time, they said\r\n\r\nthere  were riots and industrial action. So  on  that\r\n\r\nground, the management conceded to their demand.  But\r\n\r\neveryone  in the Bus Workers Union and all  Singapore\r\n\r\nbus  workers know that that right was fought  for  by\r\n\r\nthe  workers themselves in order to bring back  their\r\n\r\ncolleagues into employment. But instead of  using  it\r\n\r\nfor  the  good  of the ex-employees, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson's  colleague, Mr Fong Swee Suan,  used  that\r\n\r\nright to recruit Barisan cadres into the Bus Company.\r\n\r\nHe   cannot  deny  that.  All  the  bus  workers  are\r\n\r\nchallenging  him.  Mr  Tan  Say  Kam,  who  is   the\r\n\r\nsecretary  of that union, was being pestered  and  he\r\n\r\nhad  to  hide  himself on certain occasions,  because\r\n\r\ngroups of workers were chasing after him.

This morning  in\r\n\r\nPepsi-Cola,  known as the Union Ltd.,  a  ballot  was\r\n\r\nheld.   These  are  the  Chinese-educated  industrial\r\n\r\nworkers.  Out  of  146 employees, 133  voted  in  the\r\n\r\nsecret  ballot and 101 voted for the Singapore Manual\r\n\r\nand  Mercantile Workers Union; only 27 indicated that\r\n\r\nthey  were  not members of the Singapore  Manual  and\r\n\r\nMercantile Workers Union. So I presume that this  can\r\n\r\nbe  an indication that there are only 27 members  now\r\n\r\nwho  are  members of the Singapore General Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said last night, I quite appreciate how anxious\r\n\r\nand  frightened  the  Member for Thomson  is  getting\r\n\r\nnowadays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I suggested last night that the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary and his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  should bring the whole of the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour to this Chamber so that they can refer to  all\r\n\r\ntheir files.

Therefore, I just\r\n\r\nwant  to confine myself to one or two points and also\r\n\r\nto explain our basic accusation that the Government's\r\n\r\nlabour  policy  is  a  policy of convenience  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. I said last night that they  had  a  very\r\n\r\ninconsistent  labour policy because the concentration\r\n\r\ngiven in solving trade disputes was political and not\r\n\r\non the merits of trade disputes as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take the case of Fraser and Co,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a  very  recent  case.  The  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  just  said  that  an  agreement  had  been\r\n\r\nreached   between   the  Singapore  Business   Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union and the employer on all claims  that\r\n\r\nwere  submitted by the union before the  strike  took\r\n\r\nplace.  Sir, that is correct. That is so. But in  the\r\n\r\nusual  style of fabrication, he has seen fit  not  to\r\n\r\ntell the whole truth. Sir, negotiations commenced and\r\n\r\nwere concluded on all items submitted by the union to\r\n\r\nthe  employer  under  section 16  of  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Ordinance as claims of the members.  After\r\n\r\nthe  settlement was reached in a peaceful atmosphere,\r\n\r\nthe employer brought up the question of retrenchment.\r\n\r\nThe  employer  wanted an item to be included  in  the\r\n\r\ncollective agreement covering retrenchment. Sir,  the\r\n\r\nunion  objected  to  this. In  this  connection,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I would like to draw the attention  of  the\r\r\n\r\nHouse  to  section 27 (a) of the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  This  is  a recent  amendment  which  was\r\n\r\nintroduced by the Government last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person or trade union which enters into\r\n\r\nnegotiations in relation to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial matters otherwise than in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of this Part of this Ordinance  shall\r\n\r\nbe  guilty of an offence under this Ordinance.'  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  provisions in this Ordinance for  a  negotiation\r\n\r\nare   sections  16,  17,  etc.  In  section  27  (a),\r\n\r\nemployers are also included. If the employer wants to\r\n\r\nintroduce  an  item to be included  in  a  collective\r\n\r\nagreement, the employer should serve under section 16\r\n\r\nas  provided.  En  the  case of  Fraser  &  Co.,  the\r\n\r\nemployer did not do this. Surely the union was  right\r\n\r\nin insisting that the retrenchment question could not\r\n\r\nbe  included  in  the collective  agreement.  So  the\r\n\r\nstrike took place because the employer was insistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conciliation officers of the Ministry of Labour\r\n\r\nwho  handled  this dispute know the facts.

Only two days\r\n\r\nago,  we  received  the letter from the  conciliation\r\n\r\nofficer  who  informed us that he regrets  he  cannot\r\n\r\nsolve this problem because the employer does not want\r\n\r\nto  concede  at  all. The current  situation  in  the\r\n\r\ndispute  is that the employer wants to sack  all  the\r\n\r\nworkers. As far as the employer is concerned, he  has\r\n\r\nsacked all the workers and they are no more employees\r\n\r\nof  Fraser  and  Co., and, therefore,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness  Houses  Employees Union cannot  enter  into\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  This  again  is  a  violation   of   a\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the I.R.O. There is a provision  which\r\n\r\nsays  that  no  employer  can victimise  workers  for\r\n\r\nhaving  taken  industrial action. The  employer  also\r\n\r\nsays  that  the workers had breached the contract  of\r\n\r\nservice  by staying away from work because they  were\r\n\r\non strike.

The\r\n\r\nMinister   himself  or  the  Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nadmitted that there were two opinions given  to  this\r\n\r\ninterpretation of secret ballot in the context of  an\r\n\r\nindustry where a collective agreement exists.

So if  one\r\n\r\ngoes through the list of these switch-overs, one will\r\n\r\nnote  that,  in some cases, switch-overs took  place,\r\n\r\nalthough there was a collective agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary said that we were\r\n\r\ninformed  of  the  reasons why a  secret  ballot  was\r\n\r\nrefused.  This is untrue. We were not  even  given  a\r\n\r\nreply  to  letters that we wrote to the  Commissioner\r\n\r\nfor  Labour. It is because of this. Mr Speaker, that\r\n\r\nlast  night  I said that it is regrettable  that  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for  Labour, who is a  public  servant,\r\n\r\nplays  politics also. I said that we appreciated  the\r\n\r\nwork  of  the  majority  of the  labour  conciliation\r\n\r\nofficers.  But  I  cannot  say  the  same   for   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for Labour. His conduct has  been  such\r\n\r\nthat  he  has treated large groups of unions  with  a\r\n\r\npolitical  bias.  Yesterday it was  reported  in  the\r\n\r\npapers.

Since  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government took office, they have  wound  up\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council and with it has gone the incentive\r\n\r\nfor  the department which was looking after trees and\r\n\r\nthe planting of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is a phenomenon of recent times that housing\r\n\r\nestates  are  springing up in  large  numbers.  Large\r\n\r\nareas  which  have  been wooded are being  constantly\r\n\r\nfelled down and houses being erected, with the result\r\n\r\nthat a lot of trees have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen brought down in Singapore and they have not been\r\n\r\nreplaced.

The Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nnow realised how important it is that trees should be\r\n\r\nplanted  and,  where brought down,  others  in  their\r\n\r\nplace should be planted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the Prime Minister's statement and I\r\n\r\ndo  hope that in future, not only will the Government\r\n\r\nor  the department which has now been entrusted  with\r\n\r\nthe  planting  of trees take a more active  and  keen\r\n\r\ninterest  in the planting of trees, but will convince\r\n\r\nestate developers that merely to bring down trees  in\r\n\r\ntheir estates to give way to houses and roads is  not\r\n\r\nthe end of a housing estate and that they should also\r\n\r\nbe encouraged, if not coerced, into planting trees on\r\n\r\nthe roads and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this particular\r\n\r\nbranch  of the City Council, the Parks and Recreation\r\n\r\nDivision,  was transferred to the Labour Ministry  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with the integration of the City  Council\r\n\r\ninto the Government machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in the last one or two years there\r\n\r\nhas  not been much work done by this Division  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  lost the Chief Parks  Officer  who\r\n\r\nresigned  for some reason or other, and we have  only\r\n\r\nmanaged  to find a replacement in January this  year.\r\n\r\nWe  are  now  proceeding actively, as the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  has pointed out, with the  planting  of\r\n\r\ntrees and looking after gardens and playgrounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,454,030 for Head 47 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 48 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Lin\r\n\r\nYou Eng ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 48 be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of item (1) of subhead 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am not\r\n\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon.

The P.A.P. have been in office  for\r\n\r\nfour years and their downfall is coming fast. The sun\r\n\r\nis  now setting for them.

For  his  information, one  new  creche  was\r\n\r\nopened  in  1962 and four new creches are  now  under\r\n\r\nconstruction: two will be completed in another two or\r\n\r\nthree months' time, one will be completed at the  end\r\n\r\nof  the year, and the other one probably in the early\r\n\r\npart of next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to how the staff working in the creches are\r\n\r\npromoted,  I can only inform the Member for  Moulmein\r\n\r\nthat   there   are  set  rules  and  procedures   for\r\n\r\nrecommending  promotions, and in any case  all  staff\r\n\r\npromotions  and  appointments  arc  governed  by  the P.S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, just now we have heard the reply  given\r\n\r\nby  the Acting Minister for Labour to the Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein. From his reply, we can see that the workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, especially the domestic  servants,  do\r\n\r\nnot  receive  any  benefits from the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment. These people place high hopes on the fact\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  be  able to  send  their  sons  and\r\n\r\ndaughters to the creches to receive care in education\r\n\r\nand  health. It is not possible for these  people  to\r\n\r\nemploy  servants. From the reply of the Minister,  we\r\n\r\ncan  see  what help the Government has given  to  the\r\n\r\ndomestic  servants.  The Government  claims  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the interest of the poorer classes, and  these\r\n\r\ndomestic  servants belong to the poorer classes.  The\r\n\r\nMinisters  who  are elected from the  populated  town\r\n\r\nareas  know  that they need people to  help  them  in\r\n\r\ntheir house work. That is why more creches should  be\r\n\r\nbuilt.  I  understand the Government have  not  built\r\n\r\nmore than ten creches during the last four years and\r\n\r\nthat  some of them have not been completed. In  1961,\r\n\r\nonly one creche was built. We do not see more creches\r\n\r\ncoming  up  now.  All  this goes  to  show  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment are not really sincere in helping to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the children of housewives and household women\r\n\r\nso that they can go out to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also said that the management and control of the staff employed in the creches are in the hands of the P.S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's method of recruiting staff to the\r\n\r\ncreches is not according to set rules. I can  give  a\r\n\r\nvery  clear  example. In the creche in Kreta  Ayer  a\r\n\r\ncertain  member  of the staff there  was  sacked  not\r\n\r\nbecause   he   committed   an   offence   under   the\r\n\r\nregulations,  but  I  believe  because  of  political\r\n\r\nreasons. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmember  of the staff was sacked for only one  reason.\r\n\r\nOn  that  night in question he was in the creche.  He\r\n\r\ninvited  his  friends to a makan.  In  the  meantime,\r\n\r\ncertain members of the P.A.P. branch There telephoned\r\n\r\nthe  police saying that there was an incident in  the\r\n\r\ncreche and; asked the police to investigate. A police\r\n\r\ninspector went there and took down the identity  card\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  all  those present at the  makan.  These\r\n\r\npeople  were all friends of the member of the  staff.\r\n\r\nThey  used  to frequent that place, i.e.,  the  place\r\n\r\nwhere  they  were then feasting. But  the  Government\r\n\r\nsacked  this member on account of his giving a dinner\r\n\r\nto  his  friends. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  person  had\r\n\r\nbeen employed for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this we can see that the fate of the staff is\r\n\r\nin  the  hands of the P.A.P., and it is their loyalty\r\n\r\nto  the  P.A.P. that decides their  appointment  and\r\n\r\nfate.  This  should  not be so, because  creches  are\r\n\r\nmaintained   from  public  money.  The   P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nrecruiting   their   own  members   into   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments in order to deal with those who  are  not\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the resources\r\n\r\nof  the State are limited and the amount that we  can\r\n\r\nspend  on  social welfare services for the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  limited to a sum that the  State  can\r\n\r\nafford. And within this limit of the State resources,\r\n\r\nwe  are  trying  to  `do as much as  we  can.  Social\r\n\r\nwelfare   services  are  not  confined  to  providing\r\n\r\ncreches  for  babies  of working mothers.  There  are\r\n\r\nother  forms  of social services. If the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu  Kang  fails  to see any  of  these  social\r\n\r\nwelfare services provided by the Government,  then  I\r\n\r\ncan only say he is perhaps blind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Choa Chu Kang has\r\n\r\nmentioned the dismissal of a creche assistant working\r\n\r\nat  the  Kreta  Ayer  creche.  The  creche  assistant\r\n\r\nreferred  to is a Miss Soh Hwee Hong who incidentally\r\n\r\nis  concurrently charged in connection with the  City\r\n\r\nHall riots. During the referendum campaign last year,\r\n\r\nthis creche assistant happened\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  to  be  an  Executive Committee member  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Tanjong Pagar Branch.  During  that\r\n\r\ncampaign,  the Barisan Sosialis Tanjong Pagar  Branch\r\n\r\n(it  was  their Kreta Ayer Branch at that  time)  was\r\n\r\nfinding  it  difficult to get a place to  hold  their\r\n\r\nbranch meetings. The idea then struck this particular\r\n\r\ncreche assistant that the creche at Kreta Ayer  could\r\n\r\nbe  a wonderful place - being very spacious - for branch\r\n\r\ncommittee  meetings and indoctrination  sessions.  So\r\n\r\nshe applied pressure on a friend who is a creche amah\r\n\r\nto  allow  her to invite all members of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Kreta Ayer Branch Committee to hold meetings\r\n\r\nin this creche. This was found out. The police raided\r\n\r\nthe  place  and  found  that there  were  no  cooking\r\n\r\nutensils,    no   food.

Sir, we all know that the branches of the P.A.P. are without cadres. They are using the community centres for their party activities. As far as I know, there are 112 community centres at present, and the P.A.P. are using them as centres for\r\n\r\npolitical  activity.  For  example,  if  V.I.P.s  are\r\n\r\nvisiting, or the Prime Minister is visiting, the only\r\n\r\nmethod  of the P.A.P. Government is to hire buses  to\r\n\r\ntransport  people  from these community  centres  and\r\n\r\ntake   school  children  with  flags,  and  to   send\r\n\r\nsupporters  to  receive  the  V.I.P.s  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres are not used as a means of  social\r\n\r\nwelfare  work. The Prime Minister has agreed to  make\r\n\r\nuse  of community centres as clinics during the  day,\r\n\r\nand at night to use them as veterinary centres. Up to\r\n\r\nnow, all we know is that the purpose of the community\r\n\r\ncentres has not been accomplished. The Government has\r\n\r\nused  these  places only to conduct  their  political\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, there\r\n\r\nis  one thing the P.A.P. can be proud of, and that is\r\n\r\nthe building of community centres. The reason for the\r\n\r\nbuilding of so many community centres in Singapore is\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. wants to give  employment  to  its\r\n\r\nmembers.  Therefore,  as more community  centres  are\r\n\r\nbuilt they can have more P.A.P. supporters. And  this\r\n\r\ncan be proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many P.A.P. branches are situated near community\r\n\r\ncentres,  because  no one wants to  work  in  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbranch. So the most convenient way for them to do  is\r\n\r\nto build a community centre near a branch or to build\r\n\r\na  branch  near a community centre. The other  reason\r\n\r\nfor the building of community centres is to install a\r\n\r\ntelevision  set in the community centre so  that  the\r\n\r\npeople can see the beautiful faces of the Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

It  is  quite\r\n\r\nobvious  that  throughout this  debate,  before  July\r\n\r\n1961,   whether   it  was  community   centres,   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Arbitration Court, or everything that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did was good. After July  1961  the  same\r\n\r\nthings  have  become bad. The community centres  were\r\n\r\nestablished  long before 1961, and many  Members  who\r\n\r\nare now in the Barisan - if you look up the Hansard you\r\n\r\nwill   see  it -   paid  a  glowing  tribute  to  these\r\n\r\ncommunity centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was quite a different story after 1961. So it is\r\n\r\nquite  clear,  Sir. The community  centres  have  not\r\n\r\nchanged - the organisation, the method of operation  is\r\n\r\nstill  the same. But the political objectives of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  have  changed.  They  see  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  another  bulwark  against   their\r\n\r\npolitical objectives. If the community centres are as\r\n\r\nthey  now  claim - purely centres for preaching  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda,  for training cadres for the P.A.P.,  for\r\n\r\nmobilising people, as they say, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbundle  them into lorries to cheer V.I.P.s   - if  that\r\n\r\nwere  so, then I am quite sure they must give  credit\r\n\r\nto  the intelligence of the people of Singapore  that\r\n\r\nthey are not going to allow themselves to be used  as\r\n\r\ncheer  leaders  for  V.I.P.s.  They  can  go  to  any\r\n\r\ncommunity centre today, or any night. They will  find\r\n\r\nthat people go there to play basketball. I cannot see\r\n\r\nany  P.A.P. propaganda but I can see basketball being\r\n\r\nplayed, sewing classes and cooking classes going  on,\r\n\r\nand people resting. I can tell them, Sir, that if, as\r\n\r\nthey  have  indicated, the P.A.P. community  centres\r\n\r\nare'  recruiting  grounds for the  P.A.P.,  then  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is even stronger than they deny it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime last week, I had the good fortune to\r\n\r\ncelebrate  the third anniversary of the Kampong  Glam\r\n\r\nCommunity Centre. The ordinary people there collected\r\n\r\nabout  $3,000 or $4,000 to put up a Teochew drama  to\r\n\r\ncelebrate the occasion of the community centre.  They\r\n\r\nwere   even   quite   prepared   to   publish   their\r\n\r\nnames - despite the Member for Thomson, they know  that\r\n\r\nif  they published their names, they would be  marked\r\n\r\nmen - as  they  knew  it had nothing  to  do  with  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  and  because they believed in the  community\r\n\r\ncentres, they felt that the occasion merited spending\r\n\r\nsome money of their own not on celebrating the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbut to say that it is a worthwhile welfare enterprise\r\n\r\nby  the Government. They say that their kids now  can\r\n\r\ngo  there and learn something instead of joining  the\r\n\r\nlittle picnic parties that are occasionally organised\r\n\r\nby the Barisan Sosialis. The kids can now go there to\r\n\r\nplay  basketball, learn to cook, learn  to  sew,  and\r\n\r\nwatch television. I wish that occasionally Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis would go to  their  respective\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  and learn something,  instead  of\r\n\r\ncoming  here  and  saying very silly  things  against\r\n\r\nwhich  we have warned them. If they could only go  to\r\n\r\nthe  community centres and enjoy the amenities there,\r\n\r\nthey  themselves  would thank the Government  for  at\r\n\r\nleast  having  provided them with one social  amenity\r\n\r\nwhich is non-political.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, when\r\n\r\nthis  House  was  debating the Annual  Estimates,  we\r\n\r\nnoted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat there were some reductions in a number of items.\r\n\r\nBut  in  this item regarding development of community\r\n\r\ncentres,  there has been an increase  to  $2  million\r\n\r\nfrom $1\u00bd million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Finance says that there will be an increase of up to $3 million next year. Is that so? Well, it appears that the P.A.P.'s industrialisation programme has turned into the development of community centres because, in 1959, when the P.A.P. came into office, there were only 18\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres.  But  to  date  there   are   112\r\n\r\ncommunity centres. This, of course, shows that it  is\r\n\r\na  great  achievement on the part of the  P.A.P.  But\r\n\r\nwhat we are concerned with now is this. For what  and\r\n\r\nfor whom are the community centres? If they are meant\r\n\r\nfor  the people, then, of course, they must be  given\r\n\r\nall  the  credit. But the community centres of  today\r\n\r\nare  meant for the service of the P.A.P. I must point\r\n\r\nout  this together with the other facts, to show that\r\n\r\nmy point is right and how community centres are being\r\n\r\nused by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on 7th June, the Minister for Labour said in this House that there were 485 members staffing the community centres. I believe that of the 485 members of the community centres, there is a percentage of up to 90 belonging to the P.A.P. They are members of the P.A.P., up to 90 per cent ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>\r\n\r\nRubbish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour also said, in reply to a question\r\n\r\nput  by  the  Member  for Jalan  Kayu,  that  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centre in Yio Chu Kang, there was a  person\r\n\r\nknown  by  the  name of Choh Ee Min.

The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare  building community centres as their own branches\r\n\r\nin order to deal a blow against the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\nMy own branch is in Woodlands. But because the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare unable to deal with the activities of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, the Land Office has given us notice to move\r\n\r\naway  from  the place to give way to the construction\r\n\r\nof  a community centre within two weeks. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Culture  and  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development say that  our  building  is  an\r\n\r\nunauthorised  building.  But  I  can  give  them  the\r\n\r\nreceipt  of  assessment and other documents  to  show\r\n\r\nthat the building is authorised and has been approved\r\n\r\nby the Government. So when I went to the officials in\r\n\r\ncharge   of   the  Land  Office  and  other   various\r\n\r\ndepartments, these officials told me that they  could\r\n\r\nnot do anything. When I asked for a reason, they said\r\n\r\nit  was  because  the Government wanted  to  build  a\r\n\r\ncommunity centre there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, my branch has been demolished and in place of it there is a community centre coming up. This is only one example to show that my point is correct.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenditure intended for the community centres\r\n\r\nis  very great, up to $2 million. But this sum of  $2\r\n\r\nmillion is only being used for the propaganda work of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. now and in the future. On the 13th of May,\r\n\r\n1960,  this  House approved the People's  Association\r\n\r\nBill. A period of three years has elapsed, and during\r\n\r\nthis  period  we  have  not  been  able  to  see  the\r\n\r\nGovernment giving us the actual accounts with  regard\r\n\r\nto  the  expenses in the community centres. How  much\r\n\r\nmoney  has been spent, we do not know; and for  whose\r\n\r\nservice  are the community centres meant, we  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  either.  In  fact,  every  department  in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has given Annual Reports, but  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  no  Annual Report from the People's Association\r\n\r\nwith regard to community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will remember that on the 16th of January, 1961, this House\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassed a resolution to set up a Commission of Inquiry\r\n\r\ninto  nepotism in the various Government departments.\r\n\r\nAbout  two  years have passed.

Since the Government is so anxious to  carry\r\n\r\nout  a  Commission  of  Inquiry  into  the  students'\r\n\r\nboycott in the examinations, how is it that it has no\r\n\r\nguts  to  set up a similar commission of  Inquiry  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the matter of nepotism?

If the Government sets  up  a\r\n\r\ncommission  of this nature to look into  nepotism  in\r\n\r\nthe community centres and other departments, then the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will  not  be  able  to  cover   all   their\r\n\r\nirregularities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

This gives rise\r\n\r\nto  much  concern.  Our concern is this.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  now  attaching their  hopes  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres which they think will replace  the\r\n\r\nactivities  in  their branches.

We have  always  taken  a\r\n\r\nconsistent  stand.  We say that the  Government  have\r\n\r\nbeen using this vote for their own political ends. We\r\n\r\nhave  been  saying  that  for  years.  The  community\r\n\r\ncentres  (in  other words, the People's  Association)\r\n\r\nare the second political arm of the P.A.P., the first\r\n\r\narm  being the Work Brigade. I would have touched  on\r\n\r\nthat had there been time, but because I lost time,  I\r\n\r\nhad  no  chance  to  say it. But on  these  community\r\n\r\ncentres, under the People's Association Ordinance, it\r\n\r\nis  a  clear indication that they are nothing  but  a\r\n\r\npolitical arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the development of community centres is, in\r\n\r\nfact,  a  very commendable thing to do and  we  would\r\n\r\nhave supported the Government every time for more and\r\n\r\nmore  community development if they had not tried  to\r\n\r\nmake use of community centres for their own political\r\n\r\nends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are indeed most concerned, especially now when\r\n\r\nwe  are getting nearer towards general election time,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government want an extra  half  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars  for  them  to  play party  politics  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres. There had been community  centres\r\n\r\nbefore  the P.A.P. came to power. But these were  run\r\n\r\nby  voluntary organisations. There was no attempt  at\r\n\r\nall  to channel community centres for the use of  any\r\n\r\npolitical Party. But since the P.A.P. came to  power.\r\n\r\nthey  introduced  a  law,  the  People's  Association\r\n\r\nOrdinance, and one can see one thing from the  set-up\r\n\r\nof  the  Board of the People's Association, with  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister as Chairman, the Minister for  Labour\r\n\r\nand Law as Deputy Chairman, the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nthe Director of Social Welfare, and six members to be\r\n\r\nappointed  by  the  Chairman.

This was done, I think, prior to\r\n\r\nthe  elections. However, since the elections,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P., far from setting up an independent body to\r\n\r\nrun Radio Singapore, has only increased the use of\r\n\r\nRadio Singapore. In recent times, to make matters\r\n\r\nworse, we have television.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure we are all aware of the fact that\r\n\r\npropaganda media like the radio and television can\r\n\r\nbe  used by those who are in power to spread party\r\n\r\npropaganda,  and the P.A.P. undoubtedly  has  used\r\n\r\nthese  organs for party propaganda.

The\r\n\r\npoint  I  wish  to  make,  by relating  these  little\r\n\r\nincidents  and  examples,  is  that  it  is  a   most\r\n\r\neffective propaganda medium as a matter of fact. T.V.\r\n\r\ntoday   does   not  have  material  to  put   forward\r\n\r\nconstructive educational programmes. Because they are\r\n\r\nso  bankrupt they have to show white men shooting Red\r\n\r\nIndians,  the  Prime Minister's visits, ten-year  old\r\n\r\nHong Kong films which are very reactionary films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason why these are being put forward is\r\n\r\nto  provide  a cover for the need of having  T.V. in\r\n\r\ntheir hands right at the moment. Having given all the\r\n\r\npriority, they must dish out something. But, Sir,  if\r\n\r\nwe   look  at  the  Government's  general  policy - the\r\n\r\nMinistry - it would appear clearly that the  radio  and\r\n\r\nTV  aside  from  the fact that they  exercise  almost\r\n\r\ncomplete control over the Press, is to further P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I need not repeat what I have said before. In\r\n\r\nmy  view, this is an abuse of State power. That is so\r\n\r\nmuch  for the radio and television and now, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nPress.  It  will  be  noted  that  the  control   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  exercises over the Press is reflected  in\r\n\r\nthe  reporting of political items. P.A.P. news  items\r\n\r\nare always played up; news not in the interest of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is always played down. Sir, this has worsened\r\n\r\nsince  the  last time we had occasion to  raise  this\r\n\r\nmatter  in  this  House. That  also  was  during  the\r\n\r\nEstimates debate under the Head Ministry of Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to say this here: that we deplore\r\n\r\nthe  Government, in the first place, for using  State\r\n\r\norgans  to  suppress publication of legitimate  news,\r\n\r\nfor  using  State  power to prevent the  people  from\r\n\r\nknowing the truth. I also deplore the Press. All  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  in  the country call themselves  national\r\n\r\nnewspapers - the  Straits  Times - $20  million   foreign\r\n\r\ncapital included - call\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\nthemselves   national  capital.   Practically   every\r\n\r\nnewspaper.  Sir, the control over the  Chinese  Press\r\n\r\ntoday  is  greater than that over the Straits  Times,\r\n\r\nand  the  majority of the people who  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nChinese  newspapers  for their news  are  denied  the\r\n\r\nright to get the news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say this before I sit down: that\r\n\r\nalthough  we do not possess State power, although  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  the  means of using  State  organs  to\r\n\r\nintimidate  and  control  the  Press,  we  have   the\r\n\r\nmanpower to do it. We do not want to intimidate them,\r\n\r\nbut  we  tell  them  this: we have  the  manpower  to\r\n\r\ncripple them if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is intimidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I could not care less how this is\r\n\r\ninterpreted by the Minister for Culture.

It is nothing but  just\r\n\r\na  propaganda  arm  of the P.A.P.,  using  Government\r\n\r\nfunds for P.A.P. propaganda purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see how much the P.A.P. has been using, other\r\n\r\nthan  $6  million  a  year on the  Work  Brigade,  $2\r\n\r\nmillion  on  community centres. The P.A P  Government\r\n\r\nwill  be  using  $10  million on  television;  a  few\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars more on radio, and these  few  items\r\n\r\nare  to replace the P.A.P. branches which have melted\r\n\r\naway,  the P.A.P. masses which have melted away,  and\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.

Party organ, Petir, which\r\n\r\nhas  no  sales  at all, is being taken,  if  I  could\r\n\r\nestimate,  as  follows. Each year they  collect  only\r\n\r\nthree-quarters  of  a million dollars  from  hawkers'\r\n\r\nlicences.  In  other  words,  what  the  P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nspending  to  replace their lost Branches  and  Party\r\n\r\norgan  requires 30 years of collections  of  hawkers'\r\n\r\nfees. Their collection from school fees from the  few\r\n\r\nhundred thousand school children in Singapore is only\r\n\r\n$1.5   million.  In  other  words,  what  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  are spending each year to  replace  their\r\n\r\nBranches  and  their Party organ  requires  about  15\r\n\r\nyears to collect from the school children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hospital fees: only $1.25 million.

The radio is,  of  course,\r\n\r\ncompletely under the control of the Minister. He uses\r\n\r\nthe  radio and T.V. for party propaganda as  well  as\r\n\r\nfor the distortion of facts entirely to the advantage\r\n\r\nof  P.A.P. I need only refer to the statement of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  one-time  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture, about a report over radio  and\r\n\r\nT.V. about the nurses' strike. The statement from the\r\n\r\nnow  Member for Kampong Kapor is that Radio Singapore\r\n\r\nhad  distorted the facts about the strike.  This,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  was not published in the Straits  Times;  it\r\n\r\nwas  blacked  out from the Sin Chew Jit Poh,  it  was\r\n\r\nblacked out from Nanyang. But, unfortunately for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  it  came out in the Malaya, Times.  This  is\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nitself  tells  us what Radio Singapore is  doing.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  there is great pressure on the  papers - I\r\n\r\nhave  a  little while back mentioned the pressure  on\r\n\r\nthe  Sin  Chew and Nanyang. But I might also mention.\r\n\r\nSir,  that  there  is also great  pressure  on  other\r\n\r\npapers  like the Min Pao. I think we had occasion  to\r\n\r\nrefer to this last year. The Min Pao, because it  did\r\n\r\nnot  toe  the P.A.P. line, was forced to close  shop.\r\n\r\nNow they have a new management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one thing which I want to draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of the House to, and that is the  blackout\r\n\r\neven  of  news concerning what the M.P.s had to  say.\r\n\r\nYou  will  remember,  Sir, you read  in  the  English\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  the  Straits Tunes, about  Mr  Brockway\r\n\r\nsaying  that the treatment of detainees was barbaric.\r\n\r\nWe looked through all the Chinese newspapers, the Sin\r\n\r\nChew, Nanyang; but not a single word.

Of course, the Press has very often been\r\n\r\ncalled  up  by  the  Prime Minister.  There  was  one\r\n\r\noccasion when the Prime Minister called up the Press.\r\n\r\nHe  told  reporters that if they wanted to  take  any\r\n\r\npicture of him in future, they must make pretty  sure\r\n\r\nthat  they  take pictures of the Prime Minister  only\r\n\r\nwhen  he  is with a crowd.

I am told, Sir,  he\r\n\r\nprojected an oval before the dog to signify food, and\r\n\r\nhe projected a circle to signify no food. So the dog,\r\n\r\nwhen  he  saw  just the oval started salivating,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  he  saw  a  circle he was quite satisfied  that\r\n\r\nthere  was  no food. But once the oval was  gradually\r\n\r\nextended to a circle the dog became so confused,  not\r\n\r\nknowing whether it was a circle or an oval, that  the\r\n\r\nresult  was a general nervous breakdown and  the  dog\r\n\r\nstarted barking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has been barking up the\r\n\r\nwrong  tree for the last 20 minutes. The first  point\r\n\r\nhe  makes, Sir, is one to which I need not bother  to\r\n\r\nreply, because he has made it repeatedly for the last\r\n\r\nthree  years,  namely, that radio and television  are\r\n\r\nused for party propaganda.

This is not clarification. The\r\n\r\nMember is making another speech. Mr Rajaratnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I would like to explain what they\r\n\r\nare  really trying to put across, and it is essential\r\n\r\nfor us to understand. The Government was elected on a\r\n\r\nspecific  policy.  Initially the policy  might  have,\r\n\r\nbeen  a  party policy. But once we are elected  as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment, that policy becomes a national policy  as\r\n\r\nlong   as   that  Government  is  the   legally   and\r\n\r\nconstitutionally   elected  representative   of   the\r\n\r\npeople.  Sir,  so it is our duty to put  that  policy\r\n\r\nacross,  and  we  were  elected  essentially  on  two\r\n\r\nthings.   That   we   stood  for   a   non-Communist,\r\n\r\ndemocratic, socialist Singapore. That might have been\r\n\r\na  party policy before we were elected. But after  we\r\n\r\nwere elected it became a national policy because  the\r\n\r\npeople approved of it, and, therefore, it is our duty\r\n\r\nto  put  across over the radio, T.V. and  other  mass\r\n\r\nmedia this policy, because there is the stamp of  the\r\n\r\npeople on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective of the Ministry of Culture,\r\n\r\nagain  a  policy approved by the people, is  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  try  and  create a non-communalist  and \r\n\r\nnon-racialist  united  Malaya  and  Singapore.  You  will\r\n\r\nnotice, Sir, that I said earlier\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the charges by the Barisan Sosialis that  Radio Singapore   and  television  have  become  propaganda organs  for the P.A.P. began when we broke away  from them  on the issue of merger, which was party policy, but  became a national policy after we were  elected. The  whole substance of their antipathy and criticism is  not  that  we are putting over party  policy  and propaganda, but that we are putting across  what  has become  a  national policy - merger. It is  quite  true\r\n\r\nthat  during  the last two years, we  have  used  the\r\n\r\nradio  effectively to win the battle for  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  We  make no bones about  it,  we  make  no\r\n\r\napology  for  it.  And  if  I  may  read,  Sir,  from\r\n\r\nDemocratic Socialism in Action, a publication by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Hmm!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> --- and we will tell him now how we\r\n\r\nused  the radio and television to expose the  Barisan\r\n\r\nas  foreign  agents,  as people working  for  foreign\r\n\r\npowers,  who want to sell Singapore to people outside\r\n\r\nof Malaysia. And we used the radio and television all\r\n\r\nout.  I can list some of the things we did. They  are\r\n\r\nnot  party propaganda. There is a long piece  on  the\r\n\r\nReferendum.  I  will read just the essential  points.\r\n\r\nThere  was  first the Prime Minister's  talks,  which\r\n\r\nagain annoy them because they were an exposure of the\r\n\r\nCommunists. And we make no apology for making  use  o\r\n\r\nthe radio to expose the Communists, and we will still\r\n\r\ndo  it. Because, after Malaysia, Sir, it is even more\r\n\r\nimportant that the radio and television, and all  the\r\n\r\nmass  media, are strengthened, because after Malaysia\r\n\r\nthe  battle  for Malaysia will go on,  but  not  with\r\n\r\nthese  gentlemen. These are the tenderfoots  and  the\r\n\r\nwolf  cubs.  They  will be out  of  the  scene.  More\r\n\r\npowerful  gentlemen are going to come  out,  both  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and outside Singapore to try to  break  up\r\n\r\nMalaysia. We are going to ensure that the mass  media\r\n\r\n-  radio and television - are up to scratch to  fight\r\n\r\nthem. That is why we are expanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Why this priority for T.V.?\", the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nasked. Because it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis important that after Malaysia, the foreign friends\r\n\r\nof  these  gentlemen, the people who are  underground\r\n\r\ntoday,  who  have  written off the  Barisan - Sir,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan is an ineffective force, they have lost  out.\r\n\r\nYou will have noticed that recently even the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  has quitted from the United Front, because  it\r\n\r\nis  a  dead duck, a sinking ship. Therefore. Sir,  we\r\n\r\nare  not going to fight them. [Interruption] In about\r\n\r\n80  days  you will know the answer, Sir. In 80  days,\r\n\r\n31st August, we will meet bigger boys, more adept  at\r\n\r\npropaganda. But we have the resources. For example, a\r\n\r\nfew  days  ago,  when  we  were  on  the  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates, they wanted to know why we wanted a\r\n\r\nshort-wave  transmitter. They know why we are going to  use\r\n\r\nthe  short-wave. Because their friends too  have  got\r\n\r\nshort-wave. [Interruption] Your friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister has been doing\r\n\r\nvery well up till now. Now he has forgotten that  the\r\n\r\nSpeaker  is  here. I suggest he try to put  his  hand\r\n\r\naway, probably in his pocket. He is pointing too much\r\n\r\nat the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir, I have tried to overcome\r\n\r\nthat  habit by holding on to a pencil, as the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park advised me once. But I am  not  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park, Sir. Still I will  take  his\r\n\r\nadvice and point the right way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other pamphlet, The Battle for Merger, we\r\n\r\ndistributed 327,000 copies which they sneered at. But\r\n\r\nwhen  we had the Referendum they knew, and they  know\r\n\r\nnow,  that  those  327,000  copies  did  their  work.\r\n\r\nBecause  those gentlemen could not get more  than  20\r\n\r\nper cent of the votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, we had Malaysia Week organised by the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture. There was no party  propaganda\r\n\r\nthere.  There was a Malaysia Exhibition organised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Culture - no party propaganda  there.\r\n\r\nThere  was  a  booklet called Malaysian Heritage,  of\r\n\r\nwhich   245,000  copies  were  distributed - no   party\r\n\r\npropaganda.  Copies are available here. I  asked  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown or the Member for Thomson to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshow  where  there  is party propaganda.  But  it  is\r\n\r\nnational  propaganda. It helps to defeat those  \r\n\r\nanti-Malaysia  elements who want to destroy  Malaysia.  We\r\n\r\nhave  even  had  a Malaysian Grand Prix  -  no  party\r\n\r\npropaganda.  If  I  recollect, Sir,  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan sneaked in quietly and even had a free  lunch\r\n\r\nat the expense of the Ministry of Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> They did not get indigestion!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No, Sir, they were well treated and\r\n\r\nsent  off  quite happy. This time I noticed  the  two\r\n\r\nBarisan  Assemblymen  did turn  up  and  they  looked\r\n\r\nsheepish, unlike at the first Malaysia Grand Prix. We\r\n\r\neven  have  Malaysia albums, film shows, posters - none\r\n\r\nof these involve party propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the Ministry of Culture has other branches\r\n\r\nunder  its  care; the Museum. Surely the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown does not suggest that the Museum is being\r\n\r\nused  for party propaganda. There are stuffed birds - a\r\n\r\ncondition  which the Barisan Sosialis might  also  be\r\n\r\nreduced  to  after  31st  August!  There  are  flint,\r\n\r\nstones, old krises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, we have the Printing Department which\r\n\r\nprints  ledgers,  gazettes  - they used  to  print  the\r\n\r\nHansard. So the only objection, therefore, that  they\r\n\r\nhave is not to the very many other departments of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture as they have for the  radio  and\r\n\r\ntelevision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am always happy that the Barisan Sosialis are\r\n\r\ngetting more anxious as the radio and television  are\r\n\r\ndeveloped.  As  I  have  said  earlier,  we  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared after 31st August for a more intense  battle\r\n\r\nfor  the hearts and minds of the people. We are going\r\n\r\nto meet more powerful enemies. This was only a trial.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Member  for  Queenstown  can  point  to  any\r\n\r\ninstance where pure party propaganda is used, then  I\r\n\r\nwill be quite happy to put the matter right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, they were talking about the intimidation of\r\n\r\nthe  Press.  For example, he wanted to know  why  Mr\r\n\r\nFenner  Brockway's  comments  on  the  treatment   of\r\n\r\ndetainees  did not appear in the Chinese papers.  I\r\n\r\ncan  tell him. He did not have to fabricate imaginary\r\n\r\nreasons. Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFenner  Brockway and his friends, before  they  left,\r\n\r\nhad  a  Press  conference where all  the  Press  were\r\n\r\nthere.  When they were waiting for the plane to  take\r\n\r\noff,  two reporters quietly cornered them - one  was  a\r\n\r\nStraits Times reporter, the other was a foreign Press\r\n\r\ncorrespondent - because they wanted to  have  a  scoop.\r\n\r\nMr  Fenner Brockway, for some reasons, did not bring\r\n\r\nup  the  matter  of detainees before  his  two  other\r\n\r\ncolleagues. So the two reporters who wanted  a  scoop\r\n\r\ntook Mr Brockway to a corner and asked him if he had\r\n\r\nanything to say about the detainees. And he said what\r\n\r\nhe  felt. Therefore, the Straits Times published  the\r\n\r\nstory;  it was a scoop. If we had wanted to stop  it,\r\n\r\nwe  would  have  stopped the Straits Times  too.  Two\r\n\r\nChinese reporters went off early, so they did not get\r\n\r\na scoop. And the U.P.I. carried the story, which I am\r\n\r\ntold  appeared  in the Australian Press.  If  we  had\r\n\r\nwanted to stop it, we could have stopped it too. This\r\n\r\nis  the  kind of imaginary, unfounded speculation  in\r\n\r\nwhich the Member for Queenstown indulges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now see the significance of the experiment\r\n\r\ncarried  out  by  Pavlov. Here  is  a  gentleman  who\r\n\r\nstarted off as a non-Communist, a socialist - the oval.\r\n\r\nSomebody provided him with a circle - Communist circle.\r\n\r\nHe read a few books.

Possibly\r\n\r\nthese  references might cause offence. They have  not\r\n\r\nso  far, and I have not noticed any objection  taken.\r\n\r\nBut they might cause offence. Mr Rajaratnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Earlier, Sir, the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\ntalked  a  great deal about the Minister for  Culture\r\n\r\nand the Ministry of Culture intimidating the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPress. But he for the first time publicly indulged in\r\n\r\nwhat  is  called \"open intimidation\". He has  charged\r\n\r\nthat  if certain newspapers, especially the Sin  Chew\r\n\r\nJit Poh, do not toe his line, he has large numbers of\r\n\r\nsupporters who can force the paper, by a boycott,  to\r\n\r\nchange its views. I have openly said that if they can\r\n\r\nproduce evidence that we intimidate in the sense that\r\n\r\nwe force the newspapers to say - \"Do not publish so and\r\n\r\nso's  speeches.\" What we might do and we often do  is\r\n\r\nthat  we would like our speeches to go in. As we have\r\n\r\nsaid  so  openly before we want to play up this  news\r\n\r\nand  we  want to play up that news. The only occasion\r\n\r\nwhere  we  asked newspapers so far as not to  publish\r\n\r\ncertain  news  items was in the A.R.T.I.S. case.  We\r\n\r\nsaid though they were news items, certain people were\r\n\r\nout  for  mischief, \"So please do not  publish.\"  But\r\n\r\nhere  openly in this Chamber, under the privilege  of\r\n\r\nthis Chamber, the Member for Thomson gets up and says\r\n\r\nthat  if the newspapers do not toe his line,  do  not\r\n\r\nplay  up the pro-Communist line, he is going to  call\r\n\r\nfor  a boycott. This is evidence of the typical  type\r\n\r\nof  intimidation. Here openly it is being done.

Sir, the ex-Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  is  either the hero  of  the  day  or  the\r\n\r\nvillain of the piece. And today if the Opposition had\r\n\r\nhad  the time, as it now does not have, it could have\r\n\r\nmade the Government so uncomfortable that in spite of\r\n\r\nall  the  propaganda  training of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture, he would find it difficult to wriggle out of\r\n\r\nthis position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was mentioned yesterday by the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth and Law that letters had been sent to this \r\n\r\nex-Parliamentary Secretary, who is the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof  the  union, and that attempts had  been  made  to\r\n\r\ncontact him several times, but failed. It would  seem\r\n\r\nthat the Minister for Culture has therefore failed in\r\n\r\nhis  duty. I would like to ask him what he  has  been\r\n\r\ndoing  in allowing his Parliamentary Secretary to  be\r\n\r\ndoing something else? That surely is a sad reflection\r\n\r\non  the Minister. We have said many a time about this\r\n\r\nparticular  man - this ex-Parliamentary Secretary,  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Kampong  Kapor,  when  he  was   Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker - in this House that it was wrong on  the  part\r\n\r\nof  the  Government to make use of  him  to  try  and\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  trade union movement. He was  made  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the T.U.C.  Not  content  with\r\n\r\nthat, several Political Secretaries were made the Ten\r\n\r\nTall  Men  of  the T.U.C. They came out very  proudly\r\n\r\nthat  these were the Tall Men of the T.U.C.  At  that\r\n\r\ntime,  it  was  well  and good, because  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nMembers  were  with them. The Barisan  Members  broke\r\n\r\naway, and the Ten Tall Men became very short men  - and\r\n\r\nnot  only are-they short, but they are now in prison.\r\n\r\nSo that is the type\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  men the P.A.P. wanted to use to capture the trade\r\n\r\nunion movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they have made use of the Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nKapor who, at first, was elected Deputy Speaker,  and\r\n\r\nlater  made a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture. Of all places the Ministry of  Culture!\r\n\r\nIt  is a type of P.A.P. culture that they try to make\r\n\r\nuse  of  public  funds for their own political  ends.\r\n\r\nThey   thought,   no  doubt,  that  by   making   him\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, paid out of public funds, he\r\n\r\ncould  be  made to toe the line and that he would  be\r\n\r\nleading this union for the benefit of the Government.\r\n\r\nI  told  the Member concerned that one day  it  would\r\n\r\nhappen that there would be a clash of loyalties. That\r\n\r\nhappened. The clash of loyalties came and the  Member\r\n\r\nchose loyalty to the Union rather than loyalty to the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, he resigned. But another typical P.A.P.\r\n\r\nculture  is this. Here is a man who has lent  himself\r\n\r\nto  be  made use of by the Government and he has  now\r\n\r\nshown  that  he  is a rebel, that he is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nfight the Government. What is the Government going to\r\n\r\ndo about it? Is it because they have now been reduced\r\n\r\nto  25 to 25 that they must tolerate this position of\r\n\r\nletting  the rebel sit there? Surely, if  it  were  a\r\n\r\nclean honest Government, it would have taken only one\r\n\r\naction, but it is not taking it. It is not taking it,\r\n\r\nbecause it knows that it cannot. It has got into this\r\n\r\nembarrassment  as a result of its own cleverness.  It\r\n\r\ntried to control the union. But now if anything  were\r\n\r\nto  happen to the Member for Kampong Kapor, he  could\r\n\r\nexpose  a  lot of things, that it was the  Government\r\n\r\nwhich  tried to make use of him to control the  civil\r\n\r\nservice. Now there is an open clash and that  is  why\r\n\r\nif  he  were removed, there would be a lot of  things\r\n\r\nthat he could say to damage the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel very strongly about this waste of public\r\n\r\nfunds  by  the Government to try to do something  for\r\n\r\nits  own  party  political ends.  We  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has learnt its lessons and will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  continue wasting public funds to fill posts like\r\n\r\nPolitical Secretaries - there are a number of vacancies\r\n\r\nthere - to achieve their party ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a subject\r\n\r\ndear  to  the  heart  of  the Member  for  Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nbecause,  as far as I can recollect, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kapor had come for censure when  he  was  an\r\n\r\nAssemblyman,  when he was a Deputy Speaker,  when  he\r\n\r\nwas a Parliamentary Secretary and now when he is back\r\n\r\nagain   as   an  Assemblyman.  So  the  problem   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, an eternal and perennial one, not  related\r\n\r\nat  all  to  the  fact whether he was a Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary,  an  ex-Deputy  Speaker  or  is   an  \r\n\r\nex-Parliamentary Secretary. So, as far as  his  position\r\n\r\nas  a  Parliamentary Secretary is concerned,  as  you\r\n\r\nknow,   Sir,   the   Constitution  provides   for   a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary to every Ministry.  For  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  to claim that the post of Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  is  a  waste of public funds  is  no  more\r\n\r\naccurate than the fact that vacant posts of Ministers\r\n\r\nare  also  a waste of public funds, or the fact  that\r\n\r\nany  other post provided for in the Constitution,  if\r\n\r\nfilled,  is  a  waste  of public funds.  Whether  the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kapor is fit to he a Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  or not is a matter of opinion.  When  this\r\n\r\nquestion came up repeatedly, especially when  he  was\r\n\r\nmade  Parliamentary Secretary, the arguments switched\r\n\r\nfrom Deputy Speaker having connections with the trade\r\n\r\nunions    to   a   Parliamentary   Secretary   having\r\n\r\nconnections with the trade unions. The point was then\r\n\r\nmade that there might come a time when his duties  as\r\n\r\na   Parliamentary   Secretary - and   a   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary is not a member of the Cabinet. I mean  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  stand collectively: all  Assemblymen  are\r\n\r\npart of the constituent elements of a Government just\r\n\r\nas in the long run the whole Assembly constitutes the\r\n\r\nLegislature  and, therefore, generally speaking,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of Singapore. But insofar as he  was  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, the point was  then  raised,\r\n\r\nand I did say that as the Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Culture, he would have no trade union\r\n\r\nfunctions,  though he might outside  carry  on  trade\r\n\r\nunion  activities  and  if  there  should  arise   an\r\n\r\noccasion when there should be a conflict between  his\r\n\r\nduties  as a Parliamentary Secretary and those  of  a\r\n\r\ntrade  unionist, then he would have to make a choice.\r\n\r\nWell,  the conflict has conic, and he has decided  to\r\n\r\nopt for his loyalties as a trade unionist. Whether he\r\n\r\ndid  the right thing or not, is a matter for  him  to\r\n\r\njudge.  As  far  as  a  Parliamentary  Secretary   is\r\n\r\nconcerned, I think the position is as what we  stated\r\n\r\nit was the last time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Time has expired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time allotted for Head 49 having expired, the\r\n\r\nfollowing  amendments, standing in the names  of  Tun\r\n\r\nLim Yew Hock, Dr Thio Chan Bee, Mr A.

I would like to ask the Minister concerned this. The United People's Party has made an application to the Assistant Secretary, Societies, and it was only after one year or so that we received a reply from the\r\n\r\nofficial  concerned, sometime in January  this  year.\r\n\r\nThe  letter  was  addressed to our Secretary-General,\r\n\r\nMr  Ong  Eng Guan. In this letter it was  instructed\r\n\r\nthat   our   Party   badge  of  three   circles   was\r\n\r\nobjectionable. Actually, there is nothing wrong  with\r\n\r\nit. There had been no objection raised with regard to\r\n\r\nour  badge.  How is it that the objection  should  be\r\n\r\nraised  after  one  year or so to  change  our  Party\r\n\r\nbadge? So our Secretary-General, the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim,  replied accordingly. In this reply, we  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that  we had done nothing against the rules.  We\r\n\r\nasked the official concerned to point out the rule as\r\n\r\nto  the power by which he has the right to ask us  to\r\n\r\nchange  our Party emblem. So we are using  our  Party\r\n\r\nemblem for the coming general elections, as is to  be\r\n\r\nexpected.  But  after this letter, we have  not  been\r\n\r\nable  to  get any reply from the Assistant Secretary,\r\n\r\nSocieties. So I would like the Minister concerned  to\r\n\r\nassure us that if there is to be any election or \r\n\r\nby-election at all, the undertaking should be given that\r\n\r\nwe  are  allowed to use the present Party  emblem  of\r\n\r\nthree circles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Societies  has  at  no time  ordered  the  United\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party to change its symbol.

On the back portion of  the\r\n\r\ncard,  the words stated are \"Removed to (Full  postal\r\n\r\naddress)\".  The  result of this is that  anybody  can\r\n\r\nregister  his postal address in any district  without\r\n\r\nresiding  in  that  district, because  the  electoral\r\n\r\nregister  is made up of names of people whose  postal\r\n\r\naddresses are so stated in their identity cards.

In any case, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe present identity card was devised in 1948 when we\r\n\r\nwere not the Government and it has been in use since.\r\n\r\nAs  far as my understanding goes, the address in  the\r\n\r\nidentity  card should be the residential  address  of\r\n\r\nthe  person.  While  it is true  that  the  electoral\r\n\r\nregisters are compiled from the identity card, and if\r\n\r\nthe  address given in the identity card is the postal\r\n\r\naddress, his name nonetheless will be included in the\r\n\r\nparticular  constituency. But the Member for  Tanglin\r\n\r\nprobably  is  aware that all the electoral  registers\r\n\r\nare  displayed  during the annual  revision  and  the\r\n\r\npublic is entitled to inspect these registers and  to\r\n\r\nraise  objection. If a voter happens to reside  in  a\r\n\r\nparticular  constituency but his  name  is  found  in\r\n\r\nanother  constituency  because  he  gave  his  postal\r\n\r\naddress, anyone could raise objection against that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was a member\r\n\r\nof   the  commission  discussing  the  limitation  of\r\n\r\nboundaries  when this point was raised.

As the House\r\n\r\nis  aware,  the  identity card system was  introduced\r\n\r\nsometime in 1947 or 1948 to serve a specific purpose.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the preparation of registers was geared\r\n\r\nto meet the system of the National Card Registration.\r\n\r\nThe   basis   of  registration  under  the  Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance is \"residence\". \"Residence\" means where you\r\n\r\nreside,  not  a postal address. I think we  all  know\r\n\r\nwhen  we  go  round canvassing certain  houses  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  60 or 70 votes, there are only about  ten\r\n\r\npersons living there, and then someone will tell you,\r\n\r\n\"Oh,  these  other  ten persons have  lived  in  this\r\n\r\nhouse, but we have never heard of the names of  those\r\n\r\nother  40. So far as we know, we have lived here  for\r\n\r\nten years and we do not know their names.\" I think we\r\n\r\nhave  all of us met with that situation when we  went\r\n\r\ncanvassing. So the question arises, \"How did these 40\r\n\r\nnames  get on to the register?\" Well, quite obviously\r\n\r\nsomebody has given the postal address as the  address\r\n\r\nof  such  and  such a person. Now,  on  checking  the\r\n\r\nelection  registers after the elections,  as  it  was\r\n\r\npossible to do sometime ago, we found that all  those\r\n\r\n40   persons   had  voted.  Although   the   election\r\n\r\npropaganda cards had not been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndistributed because they were all lying there without\r\n\r\nbeing  read,  yet those 40 voters had come  and  cast\r\n\r\ntheir votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I suggest to the Minister that\r\n\r\nthere  is  some jiggery-pokery going on.

Now, who would be  protesting - the\r\n\r\nneighbour  who lives next door and says, \"Your  niece\r\n\r\ndoes not live with you. Why is her name there?\" I  do\r\n\r\nnot think that would happen. For instance, if we want\r\n\r\nto  protest,  how  do we know that such  a  thing  is\r\n\r\nhappening  in  Kampong Kapor or in Tanglin?  So,  the\r\n\r\npeople who would be protesting have no way of finding\r\n\r\nout  and  the  people who know about it are  not  the\r\n\r\npeople who would he making the protest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Sir, if at all there is any\r\n\r\njuggling  there, it has been there for  the  last  10\r\n\r\nyears  since  we had elections in 1955. In  fact,  we\r\n\r\nencountered  the  same problem too  during  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil election and also the 1959 election, when  we\r\n\r\nfound quite a large number of voters in the Cairnhill\r\n\r\nelectoral division were not residing in Cairnhill. In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  Member  for Hong Lim  at  that  time  was\r\n\r\nwondering whether there was something fishy going on.\r\n\r\nI  think the problem can only be solved if the  voter\r\n\r\nor the identity card holder will report his change of\r\n\r\naddress promptly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  Registration  Office  and  the  Registration\r\n\r\nOffice   will  ensure  that  in  future  it  is   the\r\n\r\nresidential address that should be recorded  and  not\r\n\r\nthe  postal address. Perhaps, what could be  done  in\r\n\r\nfuture  is  that  when the present identity  card  is\r\n\r\nbeing  re-devised, a column should  be  provided  for\r\n\r\nresidential as well as postal addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> To my mind, Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nsolution  is  a  simple one.  Just  to  ask  for  \"an\r\n\r\naddress\" on the face of the identity card could  mean\r\n\r\na  postal address or a residential address. It should\r\n\r\ntherefore read \"residential address\". Where room  for\r\n\r\nfraud  does arise is in the phrase \"removal to postal\r\n\r\naddress\".  A postal address need not be a residential\r\n\r\naddress. Under the present system of identity  cards,\r\n\r\nif a man intends to commit an election fraud, he just\r\n\r\n\"changes his postal address\". So he is not committing\r\n\r\nany   crime.  Now,  if  we  say  \"removed   to   full\r\n\r\nresidential  address\" and if he still continues  with\r\n\r\nhis  jiggery-pokery,  the  Minister  is  then  in   a\r\n\r\nposition to prosecute him.

The  chief   officer,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  in a way is not independent.  He  can  be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  pressure and  he  will  have  to  obey\r\n\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that during elections in\r\n\r\nparticular  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  and   all\r\n\r\nelection officers should be independent. They  should\r\n\r\nnot  favour  any political Party. Sir, in  the  past,\r\n\r\nsome of us had to undergo favouritism. There was  one\r\n\r\ninstance  where  I  protested to  the  Supervisor  of\r\n\r\nElections against certain things that were being done\r\n\r\nwrongly   and  the  poor  officer  just   evaded   my\r\n\r\nquestions. He played for time until after, of course,\r\n\r\nthe  closing of the polling. Sir, if that officer had\r\n\r\nbeen independent, he would have had the courage to do\r\n\r\nwhat  he  thought was right instead of being  scared,\r\n\r\nsince  he was after all under orders. Sir, I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether this could be done because even if  the\r\n\r\nMinister says the man is going to be independent,  he\r\n\r\nis  still  a  civil servant in the Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs. I wonder whether the Minister could  suggest\r\n\r\nsomething so that the public could be sure that  when\r\n\r\nonce  a  man  is made Supervisor of Elections  during\r\n\r\nthat  period, he should be free from pressure of  any\r\n\r\nkind or anybody, so that the public could be sure and\r\n\r\nthe  Parties involved in the elections could be  sure\r\n\r\nthat they have somebody in charge of elections who is\r\n\r\ngoing to treat everybody in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ng Teng Kian is not speaking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>r Ng Teng Kian</b> indicated dissent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are recent\r\n\r\nindications  as  we prophesied in  our  Party  organ,\r\n\r\nBersatu  (Chinese issue) two weeks ago, that  Federal\r\n\r\nelections  will come very soon, maybe  in  July  next\r\n\r\nmonth.

Sir, they can hardly  blame  us\r\n\r\nfor  this position, because this is the situation  as\r\n\r\nlaid  down  in the Constitution, and it was  not  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. who negotiated and drew up the Constitution in\r\n\r\n1959.

When  we\r\n\r\nwere  in the P.A.P. we were blinded by them, but once\r\n\r\nwhen  we  found that they had become reactionary,  we\r\n\r\nlest    them.   Even   concerning   the   Undesirable\r\n\r\nPublications  Ordinance,  the  purpose  of  which  is\r\n\r\nreally to deal with undesirable publications, but  in\r\n\r\nactual  fact it is not so, because this Ordinance  is\r\n\r\nused  to curb any publications not desirable  to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Ever since the past few years the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nbeen banning many publications which were opposed  to\r\n\r\nit: for instance, the publication by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral  Employees'  Union  and  the  publication  of\r\n\r\nNantah - Nanyang University Students' Union. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is further suppressing us and  preventing\r\n\r\nour  publications from being published. Further, they\r\n\r\nwill not allow many unions and organisations to issue\r\n\r\ntheir  anniversary publications. On the face  of  it,\r\n\r\nthey  want to show that they are democratic and there\r\n\r\nis  freedom, but, in fact, they threatened a printing\r\n\r\nhouse  as  a result of which our Party organ  was  no\r\n\r\nlonger able to be printed in that printing house. All\r\n\r\nthis  shows  that the so-called democracy  is  phoney\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  At  present  our  Party  organ  is  being\r\n\r\nstencilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another incident is that in 1959, slogans and\r\n\r\nposters  and  printed  matter need  not  have  to  be\r\n\r\napproved,  but  nowadays the P.A.P. has  become  more\r\n\r\nreactionary.   All   these  publications,   cartoons,\r\n\r\nposters and other things will have to be approved  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.

The  general principles come  under  matters\r\n\r\naffecting  the  organs of the State,  especially  the\r\n\r\nPolice:  scenes which tend to bring the  police  into\r\n\r\ngeneral  disrepute  and  contempt;  defiance  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice  and  law and order; anything which  tends  to\r\n\r\nexcite inter-racial feeling or promote religious\r\n\r\nill-feeling  or  rivalry;  anything  that  might  provoke\r\n\r\nsedition  or cause disturbance of public tranquility;\r\n\r\ncertain matters which might contravene good taste  in\r\n\r\nregard  to public morals; films which tend to  depict\r\n\r\nhorror  for its own sake. Of course, there are  broad\r\n\r\npolitical objectives: films which tend to bring  into\r\n\r\ndisrepute the constitution and the ideals on which  a\r\n\r\nState  is founded, or to incite people into political\r\n\r\nviolence,  political  disorder  and  unconstitutional\r\n\r\nacts. These are the broad principles around which the\r\n\r\nFilm Censor has to work. Naturally, when he comes  to\r\n\r\napply  these  broad  principles  to  specific  cases,\r\n\r\nindividual  judgment comes in. That  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons why we have to have an appeal committee which\r\n\r\nconsists of nine members. Again the interpretation is\r\n\r\nbased  on the individual position of the nine members\r\n\r\ncollectively. The result is that very  often  you  do\r\n\r\nfind  that  the Federation censors on rare  occasions\r\n\r\npass a film which we have prohibited. And when a  new\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Appeal comes in, very often, on  second\r\n\r\nthoughts,  they  reverse the  decision  made  by  the\r\n\r\npreceding Committee of Appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Member for Tanglin has made this issue a\r\n\r\nrather  broad one, I have to touch on it  on  general\r\n\r\nlines.

But under\r\n\r\nthis  present system, because the Committee of Appeal\r\n\r\nis  loaded  with people with a political  bias,  some\r\n\r\ngood  films,  have been banned. There  are  two  such\r\n\r\nfilms  which were banned in Singapore but  passed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, strange to say. One of them,  \"Satan\r\n\r\nNever Sleeps\", was shown in Johore Bahru.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What is it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> \"Satan Never Sleeps\".

We do not know why that film\r\n\r\nshould have been banned in Singapore. I am even  more\r\n\r\ncurious  to  know why a second film was banned.  This\r\n\r\nsecond film, called \"The Crowning Experience\", is the\r\n\r\nstory  of  a  woman educator of Negro extraction  who\r\n\r\nrose from a very low position\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto become the founder of a college and adviser to two\r\n\r\npresidents.  She was known personally to the  present\r\n\r\nVice-Chancellor  of the University of  Malaya  as  an\r\n\r\neducator.  This  film  was seen  in  Tokyo  by  three\r\n\r\nMalayans  who  went  there to attend  a  U.N.E.S.C.O.\r\n\r\nConference;  one  was the respected  Singapore  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General, another a very well-known lawyer in\r\n\r\nPenang,  Mrs B.

In  due\r\n\r\ncourse,  the film was brought here and it was  passed\r\n\r\nby  the  Film Censor with a few minor cuts. An appeal\r\n\r\nwas lodged because in no country, except in Communist\r\n\r\ncountries had this film been banned or cut,  and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.dominated Committee of Appeal  banned  it.  The\r\n\r\nfilm  went  to  the  Federation, and  it  was  passed\r\n\r\nwithout any cut.

The list that he read out  of\r\n\r\nthe  Appeals  Committee is an old  one.  The  present\r\n\r\nCommittee  consists  of my Political  Secretary,  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's Political Secretary, Dr Huang  from\r\n\r\nNanyang   University,  Dr  Wong  Lincoln  from   the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore, Mr Tan See Chin  who  is  a\r\n\r\nlawyer,  Mr  K.  C.  Lee  (my  former  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary), Madam Chan (Assemblywoman), Inche  Buyong\r\n\r\nbin  Adil from the Dewan Bahasa, and Dr K. J. Ratnam\r\n\r\nalso from the University of Singapore. These are  not\r\n\r\nmen whose tastes can be lightly dismissed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that when the Member mentioned\r\n\r\n\"Satan  Never Sleeps\", I was quite interested because\r\n\r\nit  is  probably  a  reference  to  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhistory. I have not seen the film myself but I made a\r\n\r\nquick  enquiry. It is a very poorly produced,  rather\r\n\r\npuerile, anti-Communist film. It is not just  because\r\n\r\nit  is  an  anti-Communist film, but we believe  that\r\n\r\nanything which can intelligently expose Communism, or\r\n\r\nFascism,  or anything else, should be allowed.  There\r\n\r\nis   no  greater  dis-service  you  can  do  to   the\r\n\r\ndemocratic cause than to put forward a picture  which\r\n\r\nis  so  puerile  that  you are  likely  to  win  more\r\n\r\nconverts to Communism than anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other film, again I think probably the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin is being modest in that he did not  tell\r\n\r\nall   the  stories.  \"The  Crowning  Experience\",   I\r\n\r\nunderstand,   is  a  film  about  Moral   Rearmament.\r\n\r\nPersonally I have not seen the film, and so  I  would\r\n\r\nnot  like to make any judgment. But I am told it  has\r\n\r\nbeen   rejected  on  similar  grounds - that  in   this\r\n\r\ncountry, if you are going to expose Communism, do  it\r\n\r\nintelligently. But if you do it in such  a  bad  way,\r\n\r\nyou are more likely to rouse the antagonism of people\r\n\r\nwho  might  otherwise not be interested in Communism.\r\n\r\nAs  for the judgment of the film as to whether it  is\r\n\r\ngood  or  bad,  I  think we should leave  it  to  the\r\n\r\nAppeals Committee - nine people who have a directive to\r\n\r\nfollow.

We would like  an  explanation\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Just one matter, Mr Speaker, Sir. The\r\n\r\nother day I had a visit from a Singapore citizen  who\r\n\r\nis an Indian. He is married to a lady in India and he\r\n\r\nwas  trying to get her into Singapore. As a Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen,  he is entitled under the law, I  think,  to\r\n\r\nbring his wife into Singapore although she might  not\r\n\r\nbe  a  citizen. He produced to me his papers and  the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence  he  had  had  with  the   Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment.  The  official reply  that  went  to  him\r\n\r\nwas - no,  first  of all, there were difficulties  made\r\n\r\nabout  proof  of  marriage,  which  is  a  legitimate\r\n\r\ndifficulty. He got over that, and the Department  was\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the lady was, in fact, his wife.  Then\r\n\r\nthe final reply came saying she was not -  what was the\r\n\r\nphrase ? - in the category of persons who were entitled\r\n\r\nto  come into Singapore. I think that was the  phrase\r\n\r\nused,  although they were satisfied that she was,  in\r\n\r\nfact, his lawfully wedded wife. He was persistent, as\r\n\r\na  husband  should be as regards his wife, and  asked\r\n\r\nthe  Controller of Immigration why she was not in the\r\n\r\ncategory  of persons permitted to come into Singapore\r\n\r\nalthough  she  was  accepted as his  lawfully  wedded\r\n\r\nwife.  Came  the reply quoting some regulation  which\r\n\r\nsaid that because he had been separated from his wife\r\n\r\nfor more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  five years and had not seen her during the five\r\n\r\nyears,  therefore,  she was not in  the  category  of\r\n\r\npersons entitled to come into Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position to me seems ridiculous. Apparently if\r\n\r\nhe  had gone and seen her two days just prior to  the\r\n\r\nfive  years  expiring, she would  have  been  in  the\r\n\r\ncategory  entitled to come in. This operates  harshly\r\n\r\nagainst a poor man. The man who is well provided with\r\n\r\nmoney can go to India, see his wife and come back and\r\n\r\nhe  apparently can bring her into Singapore.  But  if\r\n\r\nyou  are so poor as not to be able to go and see your\r\n\r\nwife  for  five years and you want to  bring  her  in\r\n\r\nafter  five  years, you would have had it  under  our\r\n\r\nlaw,  so  it seems. A regulation was quoted  to  this\r\n\r\nunfortunate husband as the regulation under which  it\r\n\r\nwas  deemed that his wife was not in the category  of\r\n\r\npersons  entitled to come into Singapore. If that  is\r\n\r\nthe law, Mr Speaker - it may be, I do not know - I think\r\n\r\nit  is  a  very harsh, unconscionable and anti-social\r\n\r\nlaw. I think the Government should look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwith regard to immigration, the application for wives\r\n\r\ncoming  into  Singapore is indeed  very  complicated.\r\n\r\nMany citizens of Chinese origin who have been staying\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  for  a  number of years  and  received\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship rights are not allowed to bring\r\n\r\ntheir  wives  from foreign countries into  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSome  of  them who have had approval to  bring  their\r\n\r\nwives  are  not allowed to bring their  children  in.\r\n\r\nThese children are only about 14 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, many citizens of Chinese origin have received citizenship rights. They have looked upon Singapore as their own country. They hope to stay forever in Singapore. We cannot understand why there are such regulations to limit lawful wives to join and stay together with their lawfully wedded\r\n\r\nhusbands. Some citizens after having gone abroad  for\r\n\r\ntravel or studies and married foreign girls are still\r\n\r\nable  to  bring their wives into Singapore.  In  this\r\n\r\nparticular case, this person is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowed.  How is that others are allowed  while  this\r\n\r\nparticular case is not allowed, in spite of her being\r\n\r\na  woman  of  about 50 years old? I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to explain such a question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown has asked the Government whether it  would\r\n\r\nreconsider  the  change  of  policy  with  regard  to\r\n\r\nSingapore-born persons who are now in China and could\r\n\r\nnot  return,  if the House will recollect,  in  1961,\r\n\r\nthere  was a Review Committee of the P.A.P. of  which\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown was the Secretary, and this\r\n\r\nCommittee, after studying this problem, came out with\r\n\r\na recommendation agreeing with government policy that\r\n\r\nthese  people  should not be allowed to  return.  The\r\n\r\nreasons  are  many,  quite apart  from  the  economic\r\n\r\nreasons  which the Member for Queenstown alleged  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister had advanced. First, we would like  to\r\n\r\nknow  why these people left Singapore for China. Most\r\n\r\nof these persons left Singapore somewhere around 1950\r\n\r\nto  1954. They left because they wanted to take  part\r\n\r\nin   the  reconstruction  of  their  motherland,   or\r\n\r\nfatherland  as  you  call it.  They  were  very  much\r\n\r\ninspired by the great revolution that was going on in\r\n\r\nChina and they wanted to go in and participate in the\r\n\r\nreconstruction of their motherland. So they left this\r\n\r\nplace with no intention of coming back. Some of  them\r\n\r\neven went against their parents' wishes. They did not\r\n\r\nconsider Singapore their home. So they left. If  that\r\n\r\nwas  their reason for leaving Singapore, well, so  be\r\n\r\nit.  Since  China is their motherland, by  all  means\r\n\r\nstay there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, even those persons who claimed to be\r\n\r\nregistered  Singapore  citizens  or  claimed  to   be\r\n\r\nSingapore   citizens  because  they  were   born   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  left for China without taking  any  travel\r\n\r\ndocuments.  In  other words, they have exercised  the\r\n\r\nrights  accorded to the national of another  country,\r\n\r\nand  in  so  doing  they have lost their  citizenship\r\n\r\nrights:  and these people, quite properly,  were  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  return.  I do not  see  any  reason  for\r\n\r\nchanging  the  present policy. But, in any  case,  in\r\n\r\nanother two months' time, this will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  Central Government matter and it will be up to the\r\n\r\nCentral Government to review the matter if there is a\r\n\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other case mentioned by the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park, there was such a regulation  where,  if\r\n\r\nthe  husband is separated from his wife for more than\r\n\r\nfive years as from 1st December, 1954, then generally\r\n\r\nshe  would not be allowed to return. Since 1962, this\r\n\r\nmatter   has   been  taken  up  with  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  we  are yet to hear  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment's views. Because the Immigration Ordinance\r\n\r\nand  Regulations are pan-Malayan, it is not  possible\r\n\r\nfor us to take action on our own. Nevertheless, in  a\r\n\r\nfew  cases,  certain discretion was made  on  special\r\n\r\ncompassionate grounds and such persons  were  allowed\r\n\r\nto come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol, I have already mentioned just now that there\r\n\r\nare  various reasons why wives and children  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed in. Quite apart from economic reasons,  there\r\n\r\nis also the security reason. I am sure the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol  was  not aware that in some of these  cases,\r\n\r\napprovals  were  given for the wife and  children  to\r\n\r\ncome  into Singapore. But each case has to be  viewed\r\n\r\non  its own merits. I would say that in most of these\r\n\r\ncases,  the  sponsor  could  not  produce  any  proof\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  that  the applicants  were  either  their\r\n\r\nwives or children, and it would be very difficult for\r\n\r\nthe   Immigration  Department  officers  to  make   a\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am surprised at the Minister,\r\n\r\nSir,I remember the last time when he touched on this\r\n\r\nsubject,  I  had conclusively proved  then  that  the\r\n\r\nAdvisory Committee or Review Committee of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nof which I was then Secretary, had already agreed, on\r\n\r\nprinciple,  that  Singapore-born people  were  to  be\r\n\r\nallowed back to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nonsense!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We recommended that and that was\r\n\r\nwhat  caused us to argue and quarrel about - for  quite\r\n\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister asks why did they leave Singapore for China in 1956/1957?

Now,\r\n\r\nbecause  he  happens to be the Minister  he  turns  a\r\n\r\nsomersault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the impression\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister  was not unsympathetic.  He  also\r\n\r\nsuggested that he has a discretion in this matter.  I\r\n\r\nwill therefore pursue the matter with him. To put the\r\n\r\nposition of these Indians in the proper light so that\r\n\r\na  decision  could be taken on a logical basis.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis particular Indian who saw me is a messenger.  He\r\n\r\nis  earning a salary of $120 or $140 a month.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  possible  for  him to visit his  wife  regularly\r\n\r\nevery year. The mistake he has apparently made is not\r\n\r\nto visit her within five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor which weighs in favour of these\r\n\r\npeople  is  this. The population ratio for women  and\r\n\r\nmen, so far as this group of Indians is concerned, is\r\n\r\nheavily  weighted in favour of the male, so  that  if\r\n\r\nthey  choose to marry, they cannot marry  here  among\r\n\r\ntheir  own  people. So it is incumbent upon  them  to\r\n\r\nfind  their bride somewhere else. It has happened  to\r\n\r\nsome  of us here already. I think a sympathetic  view\r\n\r\nshould be taken of these cases. This is not a case of\r\n\r\nwhere  somebody is trying to defraud the  Immigration\r\n\r\nlaws and side-step them and bring people here who are\r\n\r\nundesirables.  I  think he is  being  a  good  social\r\n\r\ncreature. He is not doing anything anti-social and is\r\n\r\nin no way trying to evade the immigration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaws.

The Commissioner of Police is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  look  after the civil  liberty  of  the\r\n\r\nindividuals.   He  is  there  to  ensure   that   the\r\n\r\nindividual is not subject to interference and  he  is\r\n\r\nthere  to see that law and order is preserved. But  I\r\n\r\nam saying that the Commissioner of Police does not do\r\n\r\nhis  job properly. When a person is arrested,  he  is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  be given the facilities to contact  his\r\n\r\nlawyers  and  his family. I am going to give  you  an\r\n\r\ninstance where the Commissioner of Police, either  on\r\n\r\nthe  direction of the Minister or the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\ndoes  not allow the individual this freedom. I  refer\r\n\r\nto  the  arrest  of  myself and  our  legal  adviser.\r\n\r\n[Laughter] The Minister for Finance finds it amusing.\r\n\r\nBut  he would not find it so amusing if he should  be\r\n\r\nplaced in the same position as I was. I went along to\r\n\r\nthe  police station to bail my colleagues at about  a\r\n\r\nquarter  to  four. I am not talking about the  actual\r\n\r\ncase itself. I was given all the consideration by the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent, or whoever it was who was  in  charge\r\n\r\nof  the  police  station. I could  see  the  arrested\r\n\r\nAssemblyman,  but  while we were talking  to  him,  a\r\n\r\ntelephone  rang  and  immediately  after  that,   the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of the police station  told  us,  that\r\n\r\nis,  our legal adviser and me, that we would be under\r\n\r\narrest.  Mind you, Sir, we were not arrested when  we\r\n\r\nwent to the police\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstation.  The  Superintendent did not arrest  us.  He\r\n\r\nnever thought at any moment that we had done anything\r\n\r\nwrong.  But the telephone rang and immediately  after\r\n\r\nthat  we were put under arrest. That was round  about 4.10  p.m., \r\n\r\nSir. When we were told that we  were  put\r\n\r\nunder arrest, we asked, first of all, to contact  our\r\n\r\nlawyers.  The Superintendent said no. He  refused  to\r\n\r\nallow  us  a  chance to contact our lawyers.  Then  I\r\n\r\nasked  if I could inform my family. Again the  answer\r\n\r\nwas  no.  The Superintendent said that we had  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  certain processes; he gave certain  excuses.\r\n\r\nWe  accepted  that for the time being, and  since  he\r\n\r\ninsisted that we had to make a statement, do this  or\r\n\r\ndo  that,  we followed what the Superintendent  said.\r\n\r\nBut every time we asked to contact our lawyers and to\r\n\r\ninform  our family, the same answer came back-no.  We\r\n\r\nwere  told  at  the  time we were arrested  that  the\r\n\r\ncharges  were bailable charges. But somehow or  other\r\n\r\nthe  Superintendent refused to allow us to be bailed.\r\n\r\nFrom  4  o'clock  to 5 o'clock, to 6  o'clock,  to  7\r\n\r\no'clock,  to 8 o'clock, and right through the  night.\r\n\r\nSir, while we were kept inside the room we heard  our\r\n\r\nlegal adviser coming. He had heard of our arrest.  He\r\n\r\nwanted  to contact us and to speak to us. But even  a\r\n\r\nlawyer was prevented from seeing us. We were kept  in\r\n\r\nthe Inspectors' Room. We were told that if we were to\r\n\r\nmake  a  statement, we were told that if we  had  our\r\n\r\nthumb printed, we would be allowed to go home. We did\r\n\r\nthat.  Still  we  were  not allowed  to  contact  our\r\n\r\nlawyers  or  our family. Very luckily,  some  of  our\r\n\r\ncolleagues  brought some rice for us, and we  managed\r\n\r\nto  have a little bite. But all the time we were kept\r\n\r\ninside  the  police station. We were held,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nincommunicado.  I  do not know  under  what  law  the\r\n\r\npolice  kept  us. But we were so angry when  we  were\r\n\r\nprevented  from  even informing our families  that  I\r\n\r\ntold  them  that if they really wanted to punish  us,\r\n\r\nlet  them  punish us in any way they liked.  But  let\r\n\r\nthem  not  punish our families as well.  I  was  very\r\n\r\nangry,  Sir, with the Superintendent. But  he  turned\r\n\r\nround and said, \"Sorry-orders.\" We asked some of  the\r\n\r\npolice inspectors there whether this was the normal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npractice.  They  said  no. That  is  not  the  normal\r\n\r\npractice.  We  asked  whether people  arrested  would\r\n\r\nnormally be allowed to contact their family and their\r\n\r\nlawyers.  They said yes. Normally they were  allowed.\r\n\r\nWhy  then were we treated differently?

So far  this\r\n\r\npost  has  not  been Malayanised. Particularly  in  a\r\n\r\ncountry where the governing party is feeling that  it\r\n\r\nis  losing ground, the post of Commissioner of Police\r\n\r\nis   very  important.  We  see  that  they  draw  the\r\n\r\napplicant  either from the Director, Special  Branch,\r\n\r\nor  the  Assistant Commissioner of the C.I.D.  It  is\r\n\r\nvery  important, therefore, that the persons who  are\r\n\r\nbeing  groomed, being built up, who are  being  given\r\n\r\nall-round  experience for this post, must he  persons\r\n\r\nof  sufficient  integrity, and  not  sycophants,  nor\r\n\r\nposition-seekers.  If  we have  a  Director,  Special\r\n\r\nBranch - and  in the past few years most  Directors  of\r\n\r\nthe  Special Branch automatically subsequently became\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Police - who is a position-seeker  and\r\n\r\ntakes  orders  from the governing  party,  what  will\r\n\r\nhappen  is  that  the future Commissioner  of  Police\r\n\r\nwould be prepared at any time to take orders from the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   You   know,  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  has immense powers under  the  P.P.S.O.\r\n\r\nand the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCriminal   Law  (Temporary  Provisions)   (Amendment)\r\n\r\nOrdinance to help the Government in power to suppress\r\n\r\nand  repress political rivals. You know, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthey  can fix up evidence and do all sorts of things,\r\n\r\nand  there  will be a good case to detain a political\r\n\r\nrival.  Therefore,  it  is in the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nState,  particularly at a time when the  Commissioner\r\n\r\nof Police is going to retire, to be Malayanised, that\r\n\r\nwe  should have in the top ranks of the police men of\r\n\r\nintegrity,  men who are not prepared to take  orders,\r\n\r\nnot yes-men but men who believe in carrying out their\r\n\r\nduty as police officers in the best traditions of the\r\n\r\nBritish police system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Police has selected  by  the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission and he is a man  of  considerable\r\n\r\nexperience,  probably longest in the police  service,\r\n\r\nand  he  has had varied experience.

Dr Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* Amendment (2) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 55 be reduced by $10 in respect of item (2) of subhead 1.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 55 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is public relations, Sir. The Police are\r\n\r\nsupposed to be the friends of the people. But we have\r\n\r\na  recent  occasion, Sir, where the police have  been\r\n\r\nused  to hit women, and old women especially. I  will\r\n\r\nnot  enlarge  on  this now because  this  is  a  case\r\n\r\nsupposed  to be sub judice. But, of course, all  this\r\n\r\nhas been arranged by the Special Branch of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to touch on is\r\n\r\nthat the police today have been used for the breaking\r\n\r\nof  strikes. We have been saying this for quite  some\r\n\r\ntime. Last year, the year before last, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  been  saying that. But, of course,  they  always\r\n\r\nturn  round  and  say, \"Oh, you are Communists,\"  and\r\n\r\ntherefore the use of the police is justified.  Today,\r\n\r\nwe  see  employees  of the Home Ministry  itself,  in\r\n\r\nfront of the Central Police Station, in front of  the\r\n\r\nC.I.D. in  Robinson Road. They are camping  out  and\r\n\r\nthey  are on strike. And one of their placards  says,\r\n\r\n\"We  condemn Government for forcing mata-mata  to  be\r\n\r\nstrike-breakers.\" I have pictures here to  show,  and\r\n\r\nthese are pictures taken from Robinson Road, from the\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs  Ministry, and from the Central  Police\r\n\r\nStation.  I wonder whether they have suddenly  become\r\n\r\nCommunists,  or that the P.A.P. has in fact  all  the\r\n\r\ntime  been  using  the  police  to  break  legitimate\r\n\r\nstrikes.  That  is point number two. And  then,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  it  comes  to  a quarrel between  employer  and\r\n\r\nemployee,  and when both the employers and  employees\r\n\r\nrequest  help from the Police, the P.A.P. make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  the employers are served and the employees  are\r\n\r\nignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote, Sir, the instance of the Fraser strike. The\r\n\r\nemployers  asked the police for help and the  workers\r\n\r\nalso  asked  the police for help. What happened?  The\r\n\r\npolice  went to the aid of the employers and  not  to\r\n\r\nthe  employees. If the Government were really a  \r\n\r\npro-workers'  Government, they would most certainly  have\r\n\r\nused  the  police to help the employees and  not  the\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to bring up is the Special\r\n\r\nBranch. The Director of Special Branch, as you  might\r\n\r\nknow, Sir, is a direct appointee of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.  In fact, we say that he has specially  been\r\n\r\nplanted in the Special Branch. We say that there  are\r\n\r\nquite a number of key posts held by appointees of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance. I do not know, but  if  there\r\n\r\nshould be a clash between the Prime Minister and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, the Minister for Finance  will\r\n\r\nknow exactly what his position is. He has all his men\r\n\r\nplanted in the right places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the thing I want to inform the House of: it\r\n\r\nis  the  Special Branch lock-up in the Central Police\r\n\r\nStation. This does not come under Prisons, because we\r\n\r\nas  Assemblymen  have no chance of  going  into  that\r\n\r\nplace. I went to that place once, not as a chap to be\r\n\r\nput  inside,  but as a then Parliamentary  Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe  police  saluted me smartly, took me around.  But\r\n\r\nnowadays, the position is slightly different. What  I\r\n\r\nwant to inform the House is this: the treatment given\r\n\r\nto  the  political detainees in the  lock-up  of  the\r\n\r\npolice  station is too terrible for words.  There  is\r\n\r\none political detainee who was so ill-treated that he\r\n\r\nhad to bang his head against the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

But the fact is this: this person was\r\n\r\ntransferred to the General Hospital and  he  has  now\r\n\r\nfour  stitches  in  his scalp. How  can  a  political\r\n\r\ndetainee  inside a cell, with no interference  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  get  a  scalp  wound? I rang  up  the  Prison\r\n\r\ndoctor, and he informed me that the detainee would he\r\n\r\nout  of danger after three or four days. The fact  is\r\n\r\nthat  this  political detainee still has a  lacerated\r\n\r\nscalp  wound. We would like the Minister  to  explain\r\n\r\nhow  a detainee can have a lacerated scalp wound.  If\r\n\r\nit is not a case of his being driven to knock his own\r\n\r\nhead  against the wall, then it must be  the  Special\r\n\r\nBranch  using  inhuman and barbaric  methods  on  the\r\n\r\npolitical detainee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queens-town alleged that the police  hit\r\n\r\nwomen.  Unfortunately this case is pending. I do  not\r\n\r\nwish  to  say  more.  But I can  tell  him  that  the\r\n\r\ncontrary is true. The police have never been used  to\r\n\r\nbreak strikes. In fact, we have been very careful  in\r\n\r\nnot  allowing the police to be involved in a  strike.\r\n\r\nIf the Member for Queenstown would cast his mind back\r\n\r\nto  1959 or 1960, he would be aware of the number  of\r\n\r\ncirculars and instructions that I had issued  to  the\r\n\r\npolice  advising  them how to deal with  the  workers\r\n\r\nwhenever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  was a strike. As I have said again and  again,\r\n\r\nif  the  workers  were to observe peaceful  picketing\r\n\r\nrules  and  if  the employers were  to  refrain  from\r\n\r\ntaking  provoking action, there is no  need  for  the\r\n\r\npolice  to  be there. The police are there only  when\r\n\r\nthere  is a danger of a breach of the peace.  I  must\r\n\r\nsay   that   over  the  last  two  or  three   years,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  1961  and  1962,  there  were  many\r\n\r\ninstances  of  workers belonging to the pro-Communist\r\n\r\nunions  who  took the law into their  own  hands  and\r\n\r\nassaulted  members  of  the police  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\npublic.  One clear example was the President  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business Houses Employees Union,  Mr  Foo\r\n\r\nYong  Fong, who used a burning cigarette  butt  on  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  public. These are  the  persons  who\r\n\r\ncommit  all these offences. The job of the police  is\r\n\r\nto see that there is peace in a strike-bound area. It\r\n\r\nis  not  the job of the police to serve the employers\r\n\r\nor the unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown mentioned a detainee who\r\n\r\nhad  a  head injury. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  detainee\r\n\r\nwas transferred to the Central Police Station lock-up\r\n\r\nonly very recently, and within four days in the\r\n\r\nlock-up  he attempted suicide. The reasons are, (1) he was\r\n\r\na  bit  disturbed over the news that his  mother  was\r\n\r\nill; but the second and main reason was that his wife\r\n\r\nwas  fed up with him. His wife advised him not to get\r\n\r\ninvolved with all the pro-Communist elements  and  he\r\n\r\nrefused  to  heed  her  advice. Eventually  he  found\r\n\r\nhimself  in  the prison, and the wife  threatened  to\r\n\r\ndivorce  him  unless he recanted from  his  Communist\r\n\r\nbeliefs. That had a great effect on him, so  much  so\r\n\r\nthat  he  attempted to commit suicide by banging  his\r\n\r\nhead  on  the floor. How he did it is still a mystery\r\n\r\nto the investigating officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Minister says that the\r\n\r\ndetainee  was only transferred there for  four  days.\r\n\r\nDoes  the  Minister know that he had been in solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement for four months?

Sir, the Commissioner of Prisons, I take it,\r\n\r\nlooks after the prisons and all the conditions inside\r\n\r\nthem.  Political detainees have been kept  in  Outram\r\n\r\nPrison  for four months. As far as I understand,  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of the Commission  of  Inquiry  into\r\n\r\nPrisons,  1960, say that there should be no  solitary\r\n\r\nconfinement and that political detainees  should  not\r\n\r\nbe kept in the way that they are being kept today. In\r\n\r\naddition,  we  have found out that the detainees  had\r\n\r\nbeen  allowed  to come out of their  cells  for  only\r\n\r\nlimited  periods of the day. When we enquired  as  to\r\n\r\nwhy  this was so, the Commissioner said that this was\r\n\r\nbecause  he could not help it. Can the Minister  tell\r\n\r\nus whether the Commissioner was receiving orders from\r\n\r\nhim  or from the Special Branch, and why this has  to\r\n\r\nbe so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already\r\n\r\nsaid  sometime ago in this Assembly that some of  the\r\n\r\ndetainees were kept separately from the others during\r\n\r\nthe interrogation period.

In  fact,   on   this\r\n\r\nquestion,  I think the good friend of the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,   Mr  Fenner  Brockway,   made   certain\r\n\r\nsuggestions  as to how the Government could  overcome\r\n\r\nthis objection. He suggested that we should bring  in\r\n\r\nnon-political  detainees to live with the  politic  d\r\n\r\ndetainees.

But these newspapers have  \"windows\"  in\r\n\r\nthem: certain portions are cut out, and I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  the  duty of the  Superintendent  of\r\n\r\nPrisons  to  cut  out  or  make  \"windows\"   in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  before  handing the newspapers  to  them.\r\n\r\nMoreover.  I understand newspapers have to be  bought\r\n\r\nby  the detainees themselves. The Government has  $97\r\n\r\nmillion  surplus  last year. I do  not  see  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot supply newspapers to our  Political\r\n\r\ndetainees who have been deprived of their freedom  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government. The food rations are  very  poor.  I\r\n\r\nknow what the rations are: I have had a taste of them\r\n\r\nand  I can assure you, Sir, that they are not fit for\r\n\r\nconsumption. People eat them because they are  forced\r\n\r\nto  eat  them. I understand during the Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nregime  that  dry rations were supplied to  political\r\n\r\ndetainees and they could cook their own food. Similar\r\n\r\nrequests  have  been made to the present  Government,\r\n\r\nbut until now no decision has yet been made regarding\r\n\r\ndry  rations to be given to the political  detainees.\r\n\r\nThen  there  are  no  chairs  and  tables  given   to\r\n\r\ndetainees.  They have been allowed to  write  letters\r\n\r\nonce  a week, but the last time I saw detainees doing\r\n\r\nany  writing, it was done on the floor. They  had  to\r\n\r\nkneel and write on the floor. Surely that is not  the\r\n\r\nproper way for anybody to write any letter. In Changi\r\n\r\nalso,  although  they are supposed to have  badminton\r\n\r\nand other recreational facilities, these have not yet\r\n\r\nbeen provided them in spite of repeated requests from\r\n\r\nthe detainees. Until today, the detainees are allowed\r\n\r\nonly  20 minutes for visits from their families,  and\r\n\r\nthat,  Sir,  is not sufficient. Not only  that,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere are certain political detainees who have asked\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  see  their fiancees, but the Government has  seen\r\n\r\nfit  to prevent them from seeing them, although  they\r\n\r\nhave no other next-of-kin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not quite catch what the Minister said about\r\n\r\nMr Brockway, but we do know what the comments of Mr\r\n\r\nBrockway are. There is already the case of Mr  Szeto\r\n\r\nwho  has, according to the Minister, tried to  commit\r\n\r\nsuicide. He tries to pass the blame on to the family,\r\n\r\nbut  let  him look at himself. Let him look into  the\r\n\r\nmirror, and see how much he should blame himself  for\r\n\r\nthis  state of affairs. If only the Minister  suffers\r\n\r\njust  one-tenth of the sufferings of these  political\r\n\r\ndetainees  today. I think he would not  be  so  happy\r\n\r\nhere today. The callous, completely heartless way  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Ministers are treating this  question  of\r\n\r\ndetainees  has aroused not only complaints  from  the\r\n\r\ndetainees' families themselves and from us, but  also\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.'s own political supporters, the M.P.s who\r\n\r\nare  supporting  them today like John Strachey,  like\r\n\r\nArthur Bottomley - complaints, Sir, in England when I\r\n\r\ntold them of what was happening in Singapore today of\r\n\r\nthe  way  the P.A.P. is treating political detainees.\r\n\r\nThey  could not understand why the Government  should\r\n\r\nconfine  these prisoners to tiny solitary cells  and\r\n\r\nnot  implement  the  Report of  the  Prisons  Inquiry\r\n\r\nCommission of 1960. Sir, the people who put  in  this\r\n\r\nReport  are  people who have the trust of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. The Prime Minister always praises Mr Devan\r\n\r\nNair, and you will see that Mr Devan Nair himself is\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  of this Commission that has  given  us\r\n\r\nthis  Report today. In page 5, paragraph 15  of  this\r\n\r\nReport, it tells us that political detainees are  and\r\n\r\nshould  be  regarded as an anomaly  in  a  democratic\r\n\r\nsociety.  I  do  not  have to go  through  the  whole\r\n\r\nparagraph, but the Minister should realise that  what\r\n\r\nhe  is  doing  today is in complete contradiction  to\r\n\r\nwhat has been recommended by the Commission appointed\r\n\r\nby the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister there are still 11 in\r\n\r\nOutram  and there are 11 or 12 in the Central  Police\r\n\r\nStation,  but let him remember this. The year  before\r\n\r\nlast\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  was one death in the C.I.D. Let him  not  have\r\n\r\nanother  death  before he considers transferring  all\r\n\r\nthe detainees out of solitary confinement into better\r\n\r\nsurroundings. If there should be another death,  then\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  will have to bear full responsibility,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  sure, when the time comes, the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  know how to deal with the P.A.P.  At\r\n\r\nthe  present  moment, so far as  we  understand,  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch  has  a  special  interest  in  those\r\n\r\nprisoners in Changi. Outram and in the Central Police\r\n\r\nStation lock-ups. I want to remind our Ministers that\r\n\r\nthe people in charge of the Special Branch today  - Mr\r\n\r\nBlades,  Mr  Corridon. Mr Ahmad Khan - are  all  \r\n\r\nnon-citizens.  Their  loyalty is not  to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We  cannot  expect  people  who  are  not\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  who  are not loyal to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  look  after the  people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nproperly.  These  non-citizens of Singapore  are  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  serve  the  interests  of  the  colonial\r\n\r\nmasters.   Let  the  Minister  tell  us  whether   he\r\n\r\nsubscribes to all that the Special Branch advises and\r\n\r\ndoes and whether he has a hand in everything that  is\r\n\r\nhappening  in the lock-ups and in the prisons  today.\r\n\r\nLet him give us an answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Did I bear the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\ncorrectly when he said he was also dealing with the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of the Pulau Senang Settlement, i.e.,\r\n\r\nitem (49)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No. I did not mean to speak on\r\n\r\nPulau Senang at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> So it is on item (15) and item (125)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of item (15) of subhead\r\n\r\n1.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate may range over amendment (4) , which is\r\n\r\n\"That  the sum to be allocated for Head 56 be reduced\r\n\r\nby  $10 in respect of item (125) of subhead 1.\"  That\r\n\r\nis the Superintendent of Changi Prisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all detainees\r\n\r\nare  now  given reading material. It is true that  on\r\n\r\ncertain  occasions,  certain  newspapers  have   been\r\n\r\ncensored before they are given to detainees, and  for\r\n\r\ngood  reasons. The censorship is presumably  done  by\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch officers. I do not think  the  prison\r\n\r\nofficers   do   the  censoring  of   the   newspapers\r\n\r\nthemselves. I mean, it is quite normal. I do not  see\r\n\r\nwhat is wrong with that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown complains that the rations\r\n\r\nare  poor  and that they are not fit for consumption.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir  the rations are  given  to  these\r\n\r\ndetainees  in  accordance with the  regulations  laid\r\n\r\ndown.  In  fact,  I  would  remind  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown that even the Member for Anson who visited\r\n\r\nthese detainees had no complaint whatsoever about the\r\n\r\nfood. In fact, no detainees ever complained about the\r\n\r\nfood  being  poor.  The political  detainees  in  the\r\n\r\nprisons do receive a special ration very much  better\r\n\r\nthan ordinary convicted prisoners. As to why they are\r\n\r\nnot  allowed  to cook their own food,  the  answer  I\r\n\r\nwould  imagine  is obvious. Surely you cannot  expect\r\n\r\ncooking  to be allowed in the prison with  smoke  and\r\n\r\nfumes and all that floating around the place. Cooking\r\n\r\nby the detainees themselves was allowed in the Changi\r\n\r\nopen camps and in St. John's Island. Those are places\r\n\r\nwhere   cooking   can  be  done  by   the   detainees\r\n\r\nthemselves.  But  if they are in the  prison  blocks,\r\n\r\nsurely you do not expect cooking to be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We will consult the Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The visits of families are\r\n\r\nlimited to 20 minutes for obvious reasons.

As time goes on, as\r\n\r\nmore  detainees are released, there are  less  people\r\n\r\naround  which makes supervision easier  and  we  will\r\n\r\nconsider  extending the time for visits by  families,\r\n\r\nit  is  true we did refuse in one case to  allow  the\r\n\r\nfiancee  to  visit  a detainee.

But because of the  time\r\n\r\nlimit,  I  do  not wish to touch on my  own  personal\r\n\r\nexperience. I have been paying close attention to all\r\n\r\nthese  debates, but I find that the Minister  himself\r\n\r\nhas not made adequate replies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the charges that we have made. Our Party Chairman\r\n\r\nhas said that when we paid visits to the prisons,  we\r\n\r\nnoticed that the detainees had been ill-treated,  and\r\n\r\nso  we  made our complaints to the Superintendent  of\r\n\r\nPrisons.  But  he  said all these  were  instructions\r\n\r\ngiven   from   the  top.  We  asked  who   gave   the\r\n\r\ninstructions   - was  it  the  Special  Branch  or  the\r\n\r\nMinister? No answer was given. Can the Minister  give\r\n\r\nus the answer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, just\r\n\r\nnow  the  Minister for Home Affairs has said in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  only one of the political detainees  was\r\n\r\nrefused  visits  from members of the family  and  the\r\n\r\nothers were all allowed family visits. That was  what\r\n\r\nhe said. Perhaps this is because the Minister himself\r\n\r\ndoes  not understand the true position or perhaps  he\r\n\r\nhas  told us an untruth in this House. I can give him\r\n\r\na very clear example. Mr Lim Woon Chye is flow being\r\n\r\ndetained  in  Muar.  His wife is  being  detained  in\r\n\r\nOutram  Prison. When the father of Mr Lim Woon  Chye\r\n\r\nwrote  two letters to the Government making a request\r\n\r\nto  visit his daughter-in-law, it was not granted and\r\n\r\nso  the  father of Mr Lim Woon Chye personally  came\r\n\r\ndown to Singapura from Muar to see the Superintendent\r\n\r\nof  Outram  Prison and the officials of  the  Special\r\n\r\nBranch. But the result is that he has not been  given\r\n\r\npermission to see his daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the matter of detainees who have not been convicted, I will say that the Government is not giving them a fair deal. These people are now being detained in the remand prison. Because they have not been convicted by any court, they should be given all the rights that they could be enjoying outside. I\r\n\r\nmyself  spent  about one week in the  remand  prison.\r\n\r\nMany of the prisoners in remand complained to us that\r\n\r\nthey  were unable to contact their counsel. They were\r\n\r\nunable  to  tell  members of their family  and  their\r\n\r\ncounsel  to get bail arranged. As a result  of  this,\r\n\r\nthose  who are actually bailable are not actually  on\r\n\r\nbail  and  so the only way out for them is  to  write\r\n\r\nletters to their families. But the letters will  take\r\n\r\nsome  two weeks before they can actually be delivered\r\n\r\nto the homes. Sir, this is a very unfair way of doing\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on the 1st of May, Mr T.

His reason was that all\r\n\r\nthese  books must be censored. Mr Speaker, a  lawyer\r\n\r\nmust  be allowed to look through the law books before\r\n\r\nhe  can  argue  it  in the court.

I  believe  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education knows what he would become  if\r\n\r\nthe policy of equal treatment for the four streams of\r\n\r\neducation  cannot be implemented. For four  years  he\r\n\r\nhas  been sitting there in his office doing his  best\r\n\r\nto  clean up all the dishonest and dirty work left by\r\n\r\nthe former Minister for Education, Mr Chew Swee Kee,\r\n\r\nand  his colonial masters. For four years. I believe,\r\n\r\nhe has worked very hard, but it is regrettable to say\r\n\r\nthat his promise still has not been carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir in a multi-racial society like\r\n\r\nSingapore the education problem is a very complicated\r\n\r\none,  and  it  must be handled with  care,  otherwise\r\n\r\nthere will be resentment from the people. We have  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  four  different streams of  education  but\r\n\r\nthese four different streams of education are treated\r\n\r\nunder two different kinds of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the treatment given to English education is\r\n\r\nvery  much  better  than  that  given  to  the  other\r\n\r\nstreams,  especially in the field of employment.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has only a few months to go, or maybe  one\r\n\r\nyear,  and the four-year old promise of the  Minister\r\n\r\nis still in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, has the Government any plan to solve the Nantah\r\n\r\nproblem,   especially  the  recognition  of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  degrees and financial  help,  and  is  he\r\n\r\nprepared to give any help to Ngee Ann College?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1962 the number of enrolments to enter\r\n\r\nPrimary I in Chinese schools was very, very small  if\r\n\r\ncompared  to the enrolments in English schools.  Why?\r\n\r\nThe reason is because of the unequal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreatment given to Chinese education, is the Minister\r\n\r\naware  why there is such a great decrease of  Chinese\r\n\r\npupils  in  primary schools? If an elected Government\r\n\r\nof  Singapore cannot solve the education  problem  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  how  can we expect, after  Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government to solve the education  problem\r\n\r\nin Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very\r\n\r\nunusual for a Member of the Barisan Sosialis to  pay\r\n\r\ncompliments  to  me, saying that I have  worked  very\r\n\r\nhard,  tried  my best, et cetera, for the  last  four\r\n\r\nyours  to clear the legacy of the past, and to  admit\r\n\r\nthat  it  is a pretty complicated educational  system\r\n\r\nthat has to be solve in Singapore and that it has  to\r\n\r\nbe  treated  with care. It is, therefore, because  of\r\n\r\nthis that, whereas in most countries of the world the\r\n\r\neducational system would be based on one language  as\r\n\r\nthe  chief  medium of instruction, we  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nhaving  inherited  four  language  streams,  have  to\r\n\r\nproceed carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to answer the first criticism made by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Changi why the 1962  enrolment  was\r\n\r\nsmall in respect of Chinese schools. It is the policy\r\n\r\nof the Government to allow parents to make the choice\r\n\r\nfor their children as to which language medium school\r\n\r\nthey wish their children to be in, and it is the duty\r\n\r\nof the Government to provide the facilities once that\r\n\r\nchoice  has  been made. It is, therefore, a  decision\r\n\r\nmade by the parents and citizens of Singapore. If the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Changi really wants  to  know  the  real\r\n\r\nreason  why parents choose not to send their children\r\n\r\nto  Chinese schools, then it is time that  they  stop\r\n\r\ndoing  the  foolish  things of introducing  polities,\r\n\r\nmisleading young, innocent children by dragging  them\r\n\r\ninto political controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes again the statement of alleging better\r\n\r\ntreatment for the English-educated. This has been the\r\n\r\ntheme  song  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  that  has  no\r\n\r\nfoundation   whatsoever.  They  always   persist   in\r\n\r\ndistorting what is true. When the thing is white,  it\r\n\r\nis black to them. When we talk of truth, they talk of\r\n\r\nfalsehoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his ignorance, the Member talks of when the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  recognise the  degrees  of  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.

That has\r\n\r\nbeen  carried  out  for  the  last  four  years  when\r\n\r\ngraduates of Nanyang University, wishing to teach  in\r\n\r\nour secondary schools or to enter Government service,\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  have their applications  subject  to\r\n\r\nconsideration  by the Public Service  Commission  and\r\n\r\nappointed thereby.

But if the Government is really sincere  in\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of equal treatment  of  the  four\r\n\r\nstreams of education, then it must make sure that job\r\n\r\nopportunities are available equally in all  the  four\r\n\r\nstreams.  At the present moment, the Chinese-educated\r\n\r\ncan  go to Nantah, but Nantah qualifications are  not\r\n\r\nrecognised.

A  little while ago the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation has said that the decrease in the number of\r\n\r\nenrolments   in  Chinese  schools  is  due   to   the\r\n\r\nCommunists. This reason is expected because it is the\r\n\r\nway  by which he can evade his responsibilities.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  has also said that the decrease is  due  to\r\n\r\nparty politics and the choice of parents. It is  true\r\n\r\nthat parents in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  choose the medium of instruction  for\r\n\r\ntheir children. But the question before us is not the\r\n\r\nchoice  of parents. There are many schools at present\r\n\r\nand  when  the parents bring their children to  these\r\n\r\nschools  for  registration in Chinese  schools,  they\r\n\r\nwould  be told, \"Sorry, this year we have only a  few\r\n\r\nPrimary  I  classes of 40 pupils each.\" Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe population is increasing daily and the number  of\r\n\r\nschool-going population is also increasing,  but  the\r\n\r\nvacancies   in   Chinese  schools  do  not   increase\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly. The number of enrolments is  related\r\n\r\nto    the   number   of   vacancies.   Under    these\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  a  parent has no alternative  but  to\r\n\r\nsend  his  child to another school. It is a  case  of\r\n\r\nHobson's  choice. Therefore, it is not  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfree  choice  of  the parents. For instance,  when  a\r\n\r\nperson  has  to ea, the Government says, \"I  have  no\r\n\r\nrice  for  you; accept bread. So the only alternative\r\n\r\nis for you to take this loaf of bread or go hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has not denied the fact that there\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  decrease in the number of  students  in\r\n\r\nChinese  schools.  On  the 5th April  this  year  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education replied to a Question in  this\r\n\r\nHouse [Hansard, 5th April, 1963, col. 74] in which he\r\n\r\ngave  detailed  figures.  He  gave  the  figures   as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                1962      1963\r\n\r\nMalay medium schools           21,249    24,311\r\n\r\nChinese medium schools        132,632   130,995\r\n\r\nEnglish medium schools        163,669   177,440\r\n\r\nTamil medium schools            1,406     1,518\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these figures given by the Minister, we can\r\n\r\nclearly  see that there is a decrease of about  2,000\r\n\r\npupils in the Chinese schools, whereas for the  other\r\n\r\nstreams   the  figures  remain  the  same.  We   can,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  see  that  the education  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  not to fulfil their policy  of  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment of the four streams of education.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  educational societies, organisations,  including\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese Chamber of Commerce, have no alternative\r\n\r\nbut to make a call to parents to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsend  their children to educational institutions  run\r\n\r\nin  the  mother tongue. Had the Government encouraged\r\n\r\nthe development of education in the mother tongue.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  these educational bodies would have  had  no\r\n\r\nneed  to  appeal  to  parents.  This  simple  example\r\n\r\nclearly shows that the Government is not carrying out\r\n\r\nits   policy  of  equal  treatment  but  instead  has\r\n\r\nindulged in discrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education has also said that eight Government schools have been built in the rural areas, and that because parents choose to send their children to English schools the number of Government Chinese schools is small. That is not so in fact, 98 per cent of the schools in the rural areas are\r\n\r\nGovernment-aided  schools. When these  aided  schools\r\n\r\nwish  to  expand, they should get a 60-year lease  of\r\n\r\nthe land, as otherwise Government would not allow the\r\n\r\nexpansion.  In  addition, the Health Department  also\r\n\r\nrequires such schools to have sanitary facilities and\r\n\r\nother  conditions before approval of expansion  could\r\n\r\nbe given. Under these conditions, these aided schools\r\n\r\ncannot  expand their accommodation for  pupils.  Many\r\n\r\nsuch  schools are also built on Government land,  and\r\n\r\nthreescore they have a right to apply for  a  60-year\r\n\r\nlease for expansion. But replies from the Land Office\r\n\r\nare very disappointing to every one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister is really and truly willing to\r\n\r\nassist  and  encourage Chinese  students  to  receive\r\n\r\neducation  in  their mother tongue,  then  he  should\r\n\r\nrelax these conditions. If he could do so, then I  am\r\n\r\nsure  many  people  will come out to  assist  him  in\r\n\r\ncarrying  out this policy. But, in fact,  he  is  not\r\n\r\ndoing so. On the contrary, he is implementing a  kind\r\n\r\nof  education policy that suppresses education in our\r\n\r\nmother tongue. So in spite of all the excuses he  can\r\n\r\nthink  of,  I  do  not think he can escape  from  his\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  adopting  a  suppressive  policy,\r\n\r\nwhich is pointing a finger at him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nanswering for the Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Yes, in Mandarin. (In Mandarin)\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, the Opposition Members in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  say every now and then that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  not been implementing the policy of giving equal\r\n\r\ntreatment to the four streams of education.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  believe that they, the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers,  will  have paid attention to the  Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese   School  Teachers'  Union  and  the  Parents\r\n\r\nAssociation's  statements in  the  Press.  These  two\r\n\r\neducational organisations have made statements  after\r\n\r\ncareful  consideration. The two main  points  in  the\r\n\r\nstatements  point to the true position regarding  the\r\n\r\nfirst  point indicated in the appeal of the Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber of Commerce made after the students'\r\n\r\nboycott  of the Secondary IV Examination.  There  are\r\n\r\ntwo  points raised in this statement. The first point\r\n\r\nis  that  the  students have lost interest  in  their\r\n\r\nstudies  and  are  spending their time  in  political\r\n\r\nactivities  because  they have  been  misled  by  the\r\n\r\nagitation  of  irresponsible politicians.  They  take\r\n\r\npart  in Hsueh-hsi lessons to learn Leninism and  are\r\n\r\nalso  engaged  in  other activities  to  subvert  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. These facts are not new. We had a similar\r\n\r\nexperience during our school days. You cannot deceive\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that these people are of the\r\n\r\nopinion  that in this multi-racial society  of  ours,\r\n\r\nwhat  the students learn in school should be  revised\r\n\r\naccording  to  the context of local conditions.  They\r\n\r\nthink  that apart from political infiltration,  those\r\n\r\nstudents after leaving Chinese schools cannot acquire\r\n\r\na  high standard of English. They are therefore at  a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage  when  it  comes to  getting  employment\r\n\r\nbecause  their standard of English is law. There  has\r\n\r\nbeen  this  sort of conception. In the  past,  during\r\n\r\ncolonial days, if anybody were to say that we  should\r\n\r\nraise the standard of English in Chinese schools,  he\r\n\r\nwould he called a pro-colonialist. But now, we cannot\r\n\r\nsay that this slogan is still up to date. In fact, it\r\n\r\nis  already an outmoded slogan. It is not in  keeping\r\n\r\nwith the present times. In fact, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  have another language in  addition  to\r\n\r\none's  own mother tongue. I do not mean to  say  that\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  school students must acquire  the  same\r\n\r\nstandard of English as those students in the  English\r\n\r\nstream. But from my own personal experience, I myself\r\n\r\nwas  educated in the Chinese High School  in  Penang,\r\n\r\nthe  Chung  Ling  High School and I  believe  that  a\r\n\r\nMiddle  school student on leaving school  should  not\r\n\r\nonly be quite well versed in Chinese, but be able  to\r\n\r\nacquire  such a standard of English as  to  pass  the\r\n\r\nSchool  Certificate Examination. This is not  a  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  task  to  achieve  because, from  my  own\r\n\r\npersonal  experience, anybody who has  learnt  up  to\r\n\r\nSenior  Middle Standard must have acquired a standard\r\n\r\nof  English  equivalent  to  the  School  Certificate\r\n\r\nExamination.  This will not only be a personal  asset\r\n\r\nto  him,  but  it  will also be his  contribution  to\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if you want to put in the context of political slogans by saying that Singapore has been under colonial rule and so English is an official language of the colonialists and anybody who is good in English is a pro-colonialist, then it is all wrong because we know now that English is an international\r\n\r\nlanguage.  I  believe  that when those  organisations\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the  standard  of  English  should  be\r\n\r\nraised,  they  recognise the fact that English  is  a\r\n\r\nuseful   language.  It  is  indeed  a   very   useful\r\n\r\ninternational language. They recognise it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the decreasing number of enrolments of\r\n\r\nstudents in the Chinese schools, my own view is  that\r\n\r\nthe  students' boycott that took place  recently  was\r\n\r\none  of the important factors that accounted for this\r\n\r\ndecrease. Those students who took part in the boycott\r\n\r\nof  the  examination were unable to  get  any  school\r\n\r\ncertificate.  They arc now facing great difficulties.\r\n\r\nI  would  ask  those  people who were  agitating  the\r\n\r\nstudents'  boycott behind the scenes, how  they  have\r\n\r\nsacrificed these students, and how are they going  to\r\n\r\nhelp  those students so sacrificed? As leaders,  they\r\n\r\nhave already misled some students and they should  be\r\n\r\nheld  responsible  for  this shortcoming.  They  just\r\n\r\ncannot  run  away  from  the  fact  that  they   have\r\n\r\nsacrificed the interest of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  students. They just cannot be indifferent to the\r\n\r\nwhole  matter.  In  fact, if they  remain  to  be  so\r\n\r\nirresponsible, it will be very wrong indeed.  So  the\r\n\r\nvery  simple example I wish to make now is  this.  If\r\n\r\nthere  are politics in school and they do not  affect\r\n\r\nthe students, you just cannot say it is possible.  In\r\n\r\nthe  Chung Cheng High School there is a senior member\r\n\r\nof  the Board of Directors. He himself is a member of\r\n\r\nthe  Board of Directors for Chung Cheng High  School.\r\n\r\nIf  you  want  his name, I can give it to  you.  This\r\n\r\nperson came to see me and told me that he would  like\r\n\r\nto  send  his own son to the Catholic High School.  I\r\n\r\nasked  him,  \"Since you yourself are  a  director  of\r\n\r\nChung Cheng High School, why should you send your son\r\n\r\nto  the  Catholic High School?\" He said,  \"Well,  you\r\n\r\nknow  and  I  know.  There is  no  point  for  me  to\r\n\r\nelaborate.\"  It  occurred to me that  this  was  very\r\n\r\nstrange.  \"You  are a director of  Chung  Cheng.\"  He\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"I have my own difficulty. I shall be grateful\r\n\r\nif  you can help me.\" I referred him to the principal\r\n\r\nconcerned.  So  this is a very simple  example.  This\r\n\r\nparticular  director of the school knows  that  there\r\n\r\nare  politics  in his own school. That is  the  first\r\n\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that he knows that in the case\r\n\r\nof the Catholic High School, the student who has come\r\n\r\nup  to  Senior Middle I will be able to sit  for  the\r\n\r\nSchool Certificate in the English stream. In time  to\r\n\r\ncome,  I will say that students in the Catholic  High\r\n\r\nSchool  will  have acquired quite a high standard  in\r\n\r\nMalay. So this knowledge of three different languages\r\n\r\nwill  be  of  use to the students themselves  and  to\r\n\r\nsociety  in  general. The Parents  Association  think\r\n\r\nthat in order to enable Chinese schools to exist, the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  English in Chinese  schools  should  be\r\n\r\nraised. Because by then the parents will realise that\r\n\r\nstudents  in  Chinese  schools  will  not  only  know\r\n\r\nChinese  but English as well. So I believe  that  the\r\n\r\ndirector that I have mentioned has similar ideas.  In\r\n\r\nthe  meantime,  the  Singapore  Chinese  Chamber   of\r\n\r\nCommerce  has  made some high-sounding  slogans - \"Love\r\n\r\nChinese Education\", \"Save Chinese Education\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\netc.  But I would like to ask those people concerned:\r\n\r\nTo what schools have they sent their own children?  I\r\n\r\nhave two of my children in Chinese schools. I am  not\r\n\r\nashamed  of  this.  My two children  are  in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools.   But  some  children  of  a  certain   Vice\r\n\r\nChancellor  of a Chinese university are  sent  to  an\r\n\r\nEnglish  school. So those people who pay lip  service\r\n\r\nto  Chinese  education,  who  claim  that  they  must\r\n\r\nsafeguard Chinese education, send their own  children\r\n\r\nto  English schools. So there is no point in shouting\r\n\r\nempty slogans. All that we must do now is to think of\r\n\r\na  practical  way to ensure that our future  citizens\r\n\r\nwill  be able to become useful citizens in our\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  society.

If  you fail in the English language,  you\r\n\r\ncannot  be  promoted. But in the English school,  the\r\n\r\nChinese, Malay or Tamil language is optional.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot compulsory.

There is the new  Hua\r\n\r\nYi  Integrated Primary School, which uses the Chinese\r\n\r\nand English media, which was opened a few months ago,\r\n\r\nand  which has an enrolment of nearly 2,000  pupils.\r\n\r\nSo he is only half right there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my Parliamentary Secretary has said, if only the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis would stop the boycott and  strikes\r\n\r\nin  Chinese schools, they would be doing a service to\r\n\r\nChinese education in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock is somewhat behind time when\r\n\r\nhe  says that whilst English is compulsory in Chinese\r\n\r\nmedium   schools,   the  local  languages   are   not\r\n\r\ncompulsory  in the English medium schools.  Well,  in\r\n\r\n1960, for the Primary School Leaving Examination,  we\r\n\r\ndid indicate that if children have had three years of\r\n\r\nsecond language teaching, they will have to take this\r\n\r\nsubject  for  the Primary Leaving School Examination,\r\n\r\nwhich,  in  effect,  means that it  is  a  compulsory\r\n\r\nsubject in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I should like to answer the Member for Choa\r\n\r\nChu  Kang  who  says that the present  Government  is\r\n\r\nfollowing  a  colonial  educational  policy.

Because,  after\r\n\r\nall,  only  6  per cent of pupils, and  therefore  of\r\n\r\nteachers  in  Singapore, use Malay as the  medium  of\r\n\r\ninstruction.  So,  having  accepted  Malay   as   the\r\n\r\nNational Language of Singapore, we have to make it so\r\n\r\nthat 94 per cent of the pupils and 94 per cent of the\r\n\r\nteachers  in  Singapore will  pick  up  the  National\r\n\r\nLanguage  in course of time.

In this respect, I must say that  we\r\n\r\nhave,  I  think, progressed well. For the  last  four\r\n\r\nyears  at least 5,000 people have been able  to  take\r\n\r\npublic examinations in the National Language,  and  a\r\n\r\ngood  number of them are qualified teachers. In fact,\r\n\r\nfor  the  last  few  years we have  been  continually\r\n\r\nconducting  courses  in  the  National  Language  for\r\n\r\nqualified  teachers,  but, unfortunately,  we  cannot\r\n\r\ntake in all the teachers at one time and the most,  I\r\n\r\nthink, that we are able to handle is 1,000 per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> In view of the situation being\r\n\r\nlike  that.

It means that  we  have  to  be\r\n\r\npractical, and until we have enough Malay teachers, I\r\n\r\nthink  we  cannot enforce this ruling,  because  some\r\n\r\nparents are very worried about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> In reply to the Member for\r\n\r\nHavelock, I said that in 1960 for the Primary  School\r\n\r\nLeaving  Examination, we gave notice to teachers  and\r\n\r\npupils  that  if  a  pupil has  had  three  years  of\r\n\r\ncontinuous teaching in a second language,  then  they\r\n\r\nwill  have to take that paper for the Primary  School\r\n\r\nLeaving  Examination.  The  standard  of  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage for three years in a primary school  is  not\r\n\r\nvery  high.

This craze for examinations, almost a mania\r\n\r\nnow  with  parents, teachers, students  and  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials, is psychologically bad for young children.\r\n\r\nI remember that when you and the old Members all here\r\n\r\nwere  at school, we were not thinking of examinations\r\n\r\nas being the most serious thing in life until we were\r\n\r\nmore  or less in the secondary school stage.  In  the\r\n\r\nprimary school stage you had plenty of time for play.\r\n\r\nI  think  that  should be the privilege of  children;\r\n\r\ntheir  childhood days are made happy, and they should\r\n\r\nnot be swotting over their homework\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nday   in  and  day  out,  making  their  young  lives\r\n\r\nmiserable.

So the less we say, \"This is compulsory,\"\r\n\r\nand  \"That  is  compulsory.\"  I  think  the  less  we\r\n\r\nfrighten them, and in the end they will be able to do\r\n\r\nbetter  when  they  are older,  and  make  the  spurt\r\n\r\nnecessary in the secondary school phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there\r\n\r\nwas  equal  pay  introduced for  civil  servants  and\r\n\r\nteachers, too.

Without\r\n\r\nsufficient aid, such poor students will not  be  able\r\n\r\nto go through their university and higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Estimates in respect of the\r\n\r\nUniversities  of Singapore and Malaya, the  estimated\r\n\r\namount  for bursaries is $585,950, whereas in respect\r\n\r\nof  Nanyang  University it is $680,000. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  1961  Financial Statement, page  181,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  agreed  to pay the University  of  Malaya $473,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  the actual amount spent was $402,677. In respect\r\n\r\nof   Nanyang   University,  the  bursaries   approved\r\n\r\namounted  to  $680,000, which is the same  amount  as\r\n\r\nthat  asked for in respect of this year. But in 1961,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  only  spent  $388,000  on   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity students by way of bursaries.  So  we  can\r\n\r\nsee  that  in  1961, the Government only spent  about\r\n\r\nhalf   the  amount  of  the  vote  made  to   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity and the other half was not used at all. In\r\n\r\nthis  year's Estimates, the Government is asking  for\r\n\r\nmore  than  that  for last year  in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversities  of  Singapore and Malaya,  whereas  the\r\n\r\namount for this year in respect of Nanyang University\r\n\r\nis  the same as that for last year, So, according  to\r\n\r\nthe  Financial Statement for 1961, we can come  to  a\r\n\r\nvery  clear conclusion, that in the case of bursaries\r\n\r\nfor  Nanyang University students, the Government  has\r\n\r\nnot gone all out to help them. The Government has not\r\n\r\nmade  full  use of the money available to  help  poor\r\n\r\nstudents in Nanyang University to enable them to have\r\n\r\na higher education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there are many Nanyang University undergraduates who have to go round borrowing money from their friends and relatives to pay for their fees and boarding, and their only hope of continuing their studies is by means of the bursaries given by the Government. If these are not granted to them,\r\n\r\nthen  they will have to leave the University half-way\r\n\r\nwithout  being  able to continue  with  their  higher\r\n\r\neducation,   The   Government,  when   dealing   with\r\n\r\napplications  for  bursaries from Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nstudents,  attach  a lot of conditions  and  strings.\r\n\r\nGenerally   speaking,   the  Nanyang   undergraduates\r\n\r\ncomplied  with all the conditions, because  I  myself\r\n\r\nwas  a member of the Selection Committee at one time,\r\n\r\nbut   from  the  Financial  Statement  of  1961,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  did  not  go  all  out  to  help  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity graduates by way of giving bursaries. As a\r\n\r\nresult of this, many students were unable to continue\r\n\r\nstudying in Nanyang University. They had to leave and\r\n\r\nwork  for one year, and then return to the University\r\n\r\nto  complete their third year, because they were  not\r\n\r\ngiven bursaries. But if the Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation, including his Parliamentary Secretary, had\r\n\r\npaid  attention  to  this  matter,  they  would  have\r\n\r\nunderstood the whole position. So I hope this  amount\r\n\r\nof  $680,000  in respect of bursaries will  be  fully\r\n\r\nutilised so that more Nanyang undergraduates can  get\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  the bursaries  to  enable  them  to\r\n\r\ncontinue with their studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get to the root of the matter. This money\r\n\r\ncomes  from  the  people, but to the Government  this\r\n\r\namount  is  what is due to them. Because  this  money\r\n\r\ncomes from the people, the poor students are entitled\r\n\r\nto  get  the bursaries. It is not a grace granted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  I hope the Minister  for  Education\r\n\r\nwill  give  an  undertaking in this  House  that  the\r\n\r\nEstimates in respect of this item will not be  partly\r\n\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it just shows\r\n\r\nhow irresponsible the Member for Chua Chu Kang is  in\r\n\r\nassuming that if there is a vote, therefore it should\r\n\r\nbe  spent  regardless of anything. In the awards  for\r\n\r\nbursaries,  he  himself has admitted that  he  was  a\r\n\r\nmember  of the 1961 Bursary Selection Board, and  his\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Member for Changi, was a  member  for\r\n\r\nthe  years 1959 and 1960. These bursaries are awarded\r\n\r\nto  students  on  the  basis of  financial  need  and\r\n\r\nscholastic merits. So it does not mean that  everyone\r\n\r\nwho  applies will get it. That is why we  have  taken\r\n\r\nthe  precaution  to  have  someone  from  the  Inland\r\n\r\nRevenue  Department  amongst  the  members   of   the\r\n\r\nSelection Board, just in case declarations  are  made\r\n\r\nthat  they  are very poor but are really fairly  well\r\n\r\noff financially, and also someone from the Department\r\n\r\nof   Social   Welfare,   so   that   if   needs   be,\r\n\r\ninvestigations could be made as regards the financial\r\n\r\nposition  of the applicant.

It is correct that in the  past\r\n\r\nthere were certain difficulties over the granting  of\r\n\r\ntextbooks. They are actually not free. It  is  really\r\n\r\nlending.  Textbooks  are  being  lent  out  to   poor\r\n\r\nstudents  to use for the year and when they move  up,\r\n\r\nbooks are left behind, provided they are not tattered\r\n\r\nand  torn, for the next poor student to use them. The\r\n\r\nsystem was somewhat faulty for the last few years and\r\n\r\nthere were certain complaints that poor students were\r\n\r\nnot  able  to  borrow books in order to pursue  their\r\n\r\nstudies.  So  in  1962 we had a  position  where  335\r\n\r\nschools in Singapore, both Government and\r\n\r\nGovernment-aided,  applied  for aid under this  scheme  and  the\r\n\r\nmoney  involved was around $130,000, although we  had\r\n\r\n$190,000  in  the Estimates. This year a  notice  was\r\n\r\nissued on 5th January, a few days after schools  were\r\n\r\nopened  on  2nd January this year, and  a  simplified\r\n\r\nform  of  application was then evolved. This time  we\r\n\r\nwere somewhat faster, and I am happy to say that  for\r\n\r\nthis  year more schools have taken advantage  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme;  as  many  as  440 schools  involving  22,300\r\n\r\nchildren.  We  have actually exhausted  the  vote  of\r\n\r\n$192,000  shown in the Estimates.

Does the Minister for Education know that these teachers and students are forced to send representatives to the welcoming committee on which there are also\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   from   other   organisations    and\r\n\r\npolitical   Parties?  This  puts  the  teachers   and\r\n\r\nstudents  in  a  very  invidious  position  which  is\r\n\r\npolitical  in nature. How would the Minister  explain\r\n\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. Does the Minister know that\r\n\r\nat  every welcoming party small school children  have\r\n\r\nto stand in the hot sun or even in heavy rain waiting\r\n\r\nfor  several hours for the Prime Minister to  arrive?\r\n\r\nIs it correct to ask young school children to welcome\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister? I would like the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  to  investigate into this and  to  explain\r\n\r\nwhether it is proper for them to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. When the Prime Minister went\r\n\r\nto  the  rural areas, he once said that after  a  few\r\n\r\nyears all the secondary \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool students would be given free  education.\r\n\r\nOn  this  point  I am very doubtful, because  in  the\r\n\r\npast, when school fees were rationalised in secondary\r\n\r\nschools, the boys were charged $4 and the girls  were\r\n\r\ncharged  $3.  Why can they not reduce the  $4  to  $3\r\n\r\ninstead of raising $3 to $4? The Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nhas  also  said  that  it is likely  that  in  middle\r\n\r\nschools  the school fees will be raised  to  $10  per\r\n\r\nstudent. How is that the Prime Minister talked  about\r\n\r\ngiving  free education to the students?

Well, the Prime Minister's tour of\r\n\r\nthe constituencies is an event which is well received\r\n\r\nby  the people in the constituencies concerned,  and,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  with every visit of his, it  would  appear\r\n\r\nthat   there   is  severe  competition  between   the\r\n\r\nconstituencies to do one better than  the  other,  so\r\n\r\nthat it is snowballing and gaining great popularity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that when the Prime Minister intends to\r\n\r\nvisit    a    constituency,   certain    groups    of\r\n\r\npeople - community   leaders   and   others - would   get\r\n\r\ntogether,  hold meetings and plan for  the  reception\r\n\r\nand  welcome  of  the Prime Minister and  this  would\r\n\r\nnaturally  include organisations, schools, committees\r\n\r\nof  management, principals, and so forth. In fact, if\r\n\r\nsuch   community   leaders   are   not   invited - even\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers of schools - they will feel  as\r\n\r\nif  they  have been slighted. Therefore, if community\r\n\r\nleaders  get  together and call upon  principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers to send representatives for this preparatory\r\n\r\ncommittee,  I  see  no  reason why  they  cannot  get\r\n\r\ntogether to plan a welcome for our Prime Minister. If\r\n\r\nthe visit of the Prime Minister to the rural areas is\r\n\r\nan  event  of  no mean order and if both parents  and\r\n\r\npupils  are very excited about it and would therefore\r\n\r\nlike to celebrate, I think standing in the sun for  a\r\n\r\nlittle  while will be good for their health, just  as\r\n\r\non  National Day. I am sure the Member for  Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens,  when he was on this side of the House,  was\r\n\r\nthe better for it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  standing  for  a few hours  to  witness  the\r\n\r\nnational  parade. These are things that one  meets\r\n\r\nwith - the  waving  of flags or the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\npinching  their  cheeks,  perhaps,  while  passing\r\n\r\nthrough  and  having the thrill of  shaking  their\r\n\r\nhands.  These  are things we should  not  prevent.\r\n\r\nPeople - young  children, parents and old  women - are\r\n\r\nmaking  it possible for the Prime Minister  to  be\r\n\r\nwith  the people. After all, he has to look  after\r\n\r\nthem; so he might as well get to know them better.\r\n\r\nWell,  the  tour  of the Prime  Minister  has  now\r\n\r\nbecome such an event that teachers and pupils  get\r\n\r\nexcited and rather tired. Requests have come  into\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry for a holiday to be declared the  day\r\n\r\nafter  a  visit so that they can recover from  all\r\n\r\nthe excitement. I have granted holidays - certainly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the question of free secondary\r\n\r\neducation.  The Member for Serangoon Gardens  says\r\n\r\nthat  this  has  come to him as a surprise.  Three\r\n\r\nyears  ago  we  rationalised  fees  for  secondary\r\n\r\nschools,  so  that the girls in secondary  schools\r\n\r\nwould  be paying the same fees as the boys  at  $4\r\n\r\nper  month. The hon. Member asks: why is it he now\r\n\r\nhears  that  the  Government is contemplating  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  free  secondary education  at  some\r\n\r\nlater stage? Well, this is not just propaganda. It\r\n\r\nis  something, which a good Government, if  it  is\r\n\r\nfinancially   able  to  provide   free   secondary\r\n\r\neducation, should endeavour to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
