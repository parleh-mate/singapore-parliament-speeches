Member for\r\n\r\nAnson that neither the Singapore Bus Service Ltd., the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Vehicles nor the Mass Transit Study Unit\r\n\r\nmaintain statistics on the actual number of bus\r\n\r\ncommuters at any one time. The closest estimate\r\n\r\nregarding passenger traffic handled would be through\r\n\r\nthe number of tickets sold and daily collections made.\r\n\r\nAs many as 1.75 million tickets may be sold per day,\r\n\r\nROV is at present collecting statistics on the\r\n\r\nbreakdown of fares collected by the SBS, but due to the\r\n\r\nlarge amount of data involved it will take some time\r\n\r\nbefore the figures are available. I am glad to announce\r\n\r\nhowever, that the Mass Transit Study Unit is at present\r\n\r\nengaged in a Bus Passenger Count Survey to supplement\r\n\r\nthe data collected by ROV.

Between 10th February up to\r\n\r\n7th March, 1974, for a similar period of 26 days after\r\n\r\nthe bus fare increase became effective, the average\r\n\r\ndaily fare takings rose to $349,140 or an increase of\r\n\r\n30 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of just one month's operations after the\r\n\r\nincrease in bus fares, it is somewhat early to talk of\r\n\r\nprofits. One may, however, venture to say that with the\r\n\r\nincreased takings SBS should be able to cope with its\r\n\r\nincreasing expenditure for 1974-75 and to carry out its\r\n\r\nprogramme to replace its old buses in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe requirements of the Ministry, provide for better\r\n\r\nbenefits for workers and generally to improve the\r\n\r\nstandard of its services, hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

There are other\r\n\r\nconsiderations besides the price of oil, and I maintain\r\n\r\nthat we should not just use the price of oil as a\r\n\r\nreason for any further hikes in bus fares.

So it does not\r\n\r\nnecessarily follow that the company is allowed to\r\n\r\nrevise the bus fares by just putting hands up, as\r\n\r\nalleged by the Member for Kallang. They `have to\r\n\r\njustify it. It is too early now to talk of further bus\r\n\r\nfare increases when the new fares have just operated\r\n\r\nfor only one month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F.

Sometimes,  buses\r\n\r\nwith serious defects are ordered to be scrapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Singapore Bus Service Ltd, began operations\r\n\r\nin November last year and is a carry-over of operations\r\n\r\nfrom  the three bus companies, a total of 1,047 of  its\r\n\r\nbuses  were  scheduled by the ROV for  the  half-yearly\r\n\r\ninspections\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  to  the end of last month, February. Of these,  778\r\n\r\nbuses passed the inspections and were certified fit. Of\r\n\r\nthe other 269, about 215 did not appear for inspection.\r\n\r\nThis  sometimes happens when a bus is undergoing repair\r\n\r\nor overhaul. In such cases, the ROV usually summons the\r\n\r\nbus  for inspection again after one month. About 7  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  these buses which were summoned and  appeared\r\n\r\nfor  inspection did not pass for a variety of  defects.\r\n\r\nThe  owners were required to have the defects rectified\r\n\r\nand  to  present them again for reinspection.  None  of\r\n\r\nSBS's  buses  has, since 1st November last  year,  been\r\n\r\nfound   by  the  ROV  at  the  inspections  to  be   so\r\n\r\nunroadworthy that they had to be scrapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be stated, however, that 107 buses out of a\r\n\r\ntotal  registered fleet of 2,081 under the name of  SBS\r\n\r\nare officially laid-up, i.e, these 107 buses or 5.1 per\r\n\r\ncent  are  taken off the roads because they are  either\r\n\r\nunroadworthy  due to being badly damaged beyond  repair\r\n\r\nor  have exceeded the permissible age limit for  public\r\n\r\nbuses.

For   the   services\r\n\r\nperformed, a fee of $100 for each vehicle inspected  is\r\n\r\nlevied by the agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since March, 1973, the agent has issued 987 such\r\n\r\ncertificates for goods vehicles inspected by  them.  In\r\n\r\naddition,  ROV  has, since August, 1973,  accepted  152\r\n\r\ngoods vehicles for registration based on the submission\r\n\r\nof  an  extract of registration particulars or  plating\r\n\r\ncertificate  from  the country of  origin.

As at 9th March, 1974, the number of vehicles\r\n\r\non  the  waiting list for issue of maximum laden weight\r\n\r\ncertificate by the agent is 227.

In the case of two bakeries\r\n\r\ngiving  short-weight bread, it has  subjected  them  to\r\n\r\npublic exposure and obloquy. It has supplied the  daily\r\n\r\nlist  of  quoted prices of essential commodities  as  a\r\n\r\nservice  to  consumers who can compare the prices  they\r\n\r\nare  paying against those quoted and, therefore,  avoid\r\n\r\nfurther  exploitation by unscrupulous traders.

I am aware, Sir, that in the  case\r\n\r\nof  statutory  bodies, such as the  Port  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority, and so on, such bodies which are established\r\n\r\nby   statutes   have  incorporated  in   the   statutes\r\n\r\nprovisions  which  require the  compilation  of  annual\r\n\r\nreports  and  the submission of these  reports  to  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  Ministers  and  subsequently  to  Parliament.\r\n\r\nHowever,  not  all  Acts incorporate  such  provisions.\r\n\r\nThere  are  some  Acts establishing  certain  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies  which  have, for some reason or other,  omitted\r\n\r\nsuch  provisions, and therefore these statutory  bodies\r\n\r\nare   not   compiling  annual  reports  nor  are   they\r\n\r\nsubmitting such reports to Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the other group comprising departments in the\r\n\r\nMinistries,  these departments, I would presume,  would\r\n\r\nbe  directed  by a proper authority in so  far  as  the\r\n\r\ncompilation and submission of reports are concerned. Of\r\n\r\nabout  60  departments in the various  ministries  from\r\n\r\nwhich  reports  may be expected, only 23 are  producing\r\n\r\nreports  at  the  moment. And of  the  23  reports,  18\r\n\r\nfinally   arrived   at  Parliament   and   subsequently\r\n\r\ncirculated to Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seek the compulsory production of these reports\r\n\r\nboth  by  the statutory bodies and departments  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistries.  Apart from the fact that Parliament  votes\r\n\r\nmonies  directly  to  departments  in  Ministries   and\r\n\r\nindirectly  to  statutory bodies through  contributions\r\n\r\nand  loans, I think the convenient availability of such\r\n\r\nreports  in the Parliament Library would assist Members\r\n\r\nin  making  a  thorough examination of  Main  Estimates\r\n\r\nduring Budget sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter that I wish to touch on is not\r\n\r\nactually for the purpose of securing an answer from the\r\n\r\nMinister.  It is rather for the purpose of securing  an\r\n\r\neffect  in  the  nature of reporting of proceedings  in\r\n\r\nParliament  by  the  daily  newspaper  in  the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage. Examination of Main and Development Estimates\r\n\r\nfor  the new fiscal year takes place only once  a  year\r\n\r\nduring  Budget,  and Backbenchers  regard  this  as  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  express the views of the  constituents\r\n\r\nand  their own views upon aspects of Government policy.\r\n\r\nIt  is  natural,  therefore, that  Backbenchers  expect\r\n\r\ntheir  views  and criticism of Government  policies  to\r\n\r\nappear  in an English language daily newspaper that  is\r\n\r\nreporting proceedings in Parliament. However, it is  my\r\n\r\nview  that  there does not appear to be  an  indication\r\n\r\nthat  there  will be fair and sufficient  reporting  of\r\n\r\nproceedings   in   Parliament.  I  am  concerned   that\r\n\r\nBackbenchers receive adequate reporting in the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage newspaper daily, at least in the few  days  to\r\n\r\ncome  when  the  Main  and  Development  Estimates  are\r\n\r\ndebated  in  Parliament. Backbenchers,  in  the  Budget\r\n\r\nsessions taken once a year, certainly hope to show  the\r\n\r\npeople  that  they  can carry the  people's  views  and\r\n\r\narguments  to Government through Parliament.  It  is  a\r\n\r\npity  if  the indications are that this opportunity  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to be stifled on the one hand by a large  number\r\n\r\nof  advertisements in the pages of the newspaper  which\r\n\r\nreports proceedings in Parliament, and on the other  by\r\n\r\nwhat   I   think  is  an  excessively  disproportionate\r\n\r\nreporting  of the Government in its pages. I feel  that\r\n\r\nthere  is one whole year for Government policies to  be\r\n\r\nreported quite adequately,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhereas there is only one Budget session in a year when\r\n\r\nthe  views  of  Backbenchers on aspects  of  Government\r\n\r\npolicies may be reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

All I can say  is  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  a Member says here is properly and accurately\r\n\r\nreported  in  Hansard. They can make their  corrections\r\n\r\nbefore publication. As for the press, we do not control\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for annual reports, the position is this: in the\r\n\r\ncase  of  statutory boards, the requirement to  publish\r\n\r\nannual  reports  and  to table them  in  Parliament  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in the statute setting up the  statutory\r\n\r\nboard  itself.  In  the case of reports  of  Government\r\n\r\nMinistries  and departments, this has been  customarily\r\n\r\nhandled  administratively.  The  decision  whether   to\r\n\r\npublish  and table such reports in Parliament  lies  at\r\n\r\nthe discretion of the Permanent Secretary, who no doubt\r\n\r\nconsults his Minister when in doubt. I propose to  read\r\n\r\nan  extract from the Manual of Administrative Procedure\r\n\r\nXV, paragraph 18:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The order of the Permanent Secretary will be obtained\r\n\r\nin  case  of a department annual report on whether  the\r\n\r\nreport is to be printed and published and whether it is\r\n\r\nto be tabled before Parliament.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member wants all reports to come to Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis  means  a  considerable  effort  on  the  part  of\r\n\r\nMinistries  and  departments to write  up  reports  and\r\n\r\nleave copies in the Parliament Library. The question is\r\n\r\nwhether  this is worthwhile. I doubt it.  Where  it  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  that the contents of a departmental  report\r\n\r\nare  of a general public interest, the practice  is  to\r\n\r\nprint,  publish and table. Where, however, the  reports\r\n\r\nare mainly statistical information, which in many cases\r\n\r\nare already reproduced in the Statistical Year Book, or\r\n\r\nwhere the report of a department or Ministry is already\r\n\r\nin  the  Year Book, then the printing, publication  and\r\n\r\ntabling  in Parliament of such reports is not done,  as\r\n\r\nit  would  mean unnecessary duplication  and  waste  of\r\n\r\npublic funds for they really serve no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuseful  purpose.  Where the report of a  department  or\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  of a confidential nature, of course,  the\r\n\r\nreport  is  not published. I refer to the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence  and  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthis  is  the  reason why they are not  asked  so  many\r\n\r\nquestions in Parliament!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure Members that annual reports of departments\r\n\r\nand  Ministries hitherto published will continue to  be\r\n\r\npublished, but every attempt must be made to have  them\r\n\r\nprinted soon after the close of the year covered by the\r\n\r\nreport.  In  the  past we have reports filed  in  three\r\n\r\nyears  after the year in which it was due, and I myself\r\n\r\nhave had to take up this question with many departments\r\n\r\nin  my Ministry -- that it is pointless publishing last\r\n\r\nyear's report in 1979!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I conclude by telling the Member that if he wishes\r\n\r\na   particular  department's  report  at  present   not\r\n\r\npublished  for  general information, he can  raise  the\r\n\r\nmatter with the Minister concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Sir, I certainly welcome the Minister's\r\n\r\nsuggestion, and I beg leave to withdraw my amendment in\r\n\r\nview of the Minister's reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,724,660 for Head BC ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head CA --\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

I  also\r\n\r\nhad my reservations about several Ministries or departments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing   agencies  responsible  for  enforcement\r\n\r\naction.  In  1971,  the  Ministry  of  Health,  Police.\r\n\r\nRegistry  of Vehicles, as well as the Port of Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority,  were  responsible for  enforcement  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious anti-pollution measures. I asked if it was  not\r\n\r\npossible  for the Anti-Pollution Unit to  be  made  the\r\n\r\nsole authority for the enforcement of the various anti-pollution measures. Since then the Unit has been set up\r\n\r\nand  has been under the Prime Minister's Office.  Since\r\n\r\nlast   year  we  have  set  up  the  Ministry  of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  which  deals  with  various  environmental\r\n\r\nproblems. I think the Ministry of the Environment  will\r\n\r\nbe  the  most  suitable Ministry to be made responsible\r\n\r\nfor the Anti-Pollution Unit. My query raised in 1971 is\r\n\r\nstill  valid in respect of enforcement authority  being\r\n\r\nvested in more than one Ministry or department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

As  far as I am aware, the  anti-pollution\r\n\r\ncampaign  has  been quite successful. I wonder  if  the\r\n\r\ncampaign  could  be repeated from time  to  time  after\r\n\r\nshort  intervals  so  that our  people  are  constantly\r\n\r\nreminded of it until the problem is eradicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for air pollution, there are still buses and taxis\r\n\r\nemitting large volumes of black smoke. Can something be\r\n\r\ndone to keep a better control of these vehicles?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  actually  the Anti-Pollution  Unit  was\r\n\r\nestablished  in April 1970 and it was under  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Office. It was established initially to look\r\n\r\ninto air pollution control in Singapore. Since then the\r\n\r\nUnit has set up the necessary machinery and enacted the\r\n\r\nnecessary  legislation to control  air  pollution  from\r\n\r\nvarious  sources. On a wider scope, the  Unit  is  also\r\n\r\nresponsible for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the formulation of pollution control policy,\r\n\r\nespecially those impinging on the industrialisation  of\r\n\r\nSingapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) identification and screening of the larger\r\n\r\nindustries  according to their proneness to  pollution,\r\n\r\nand  to  encourage  the setting up of those  industries\r\n\r\nless likely to cause pollution;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the study of problems of pollution caused by\r\n\r\nemissions from motor vehicles;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the formulation of standards for environmental\r\n\r\npollution control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Unit has since actively looked into some of these\r\n\r\nproblems, and examples are the establishment and siting\r\n\r\nof  some  larger  industries, like oil  refineries  and\r\n\r\npetro-chemical industries. It also has looked into  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  hard  and  soft detergents,  pollution  by\r\n\r\nsawmills,  pollution  by agricultural  activities,  and\r\n\r\npollution by motor vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the Member for Telok Blangah will\r\n\r\nnote    that    these   problems   impinge    on    the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of many other Government  Ministries,\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  statutory bodies. Policies  on  these\r\n\r\nmatters  are  carefully considered  after  consultation\r\n\r\nwith  these  departments. Thus the Anti-Pollution  Unit\r\n\r\nserves  to  co-ordinate the departments  and  statutory\r\n\r\nbodies  involved  when it comes to pollution  problems.\r\n\r\nOften  a  choice has to be made: either not to have  an\r\n\r\nindustry because it pollutes and so losing the economic\r\n\r\nadvantages,  or  to  have the industry  with  attendant\r\n\r\npollution reduced through control with costly  devices,\r\n\r\nbut still giving economic advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having the Unit under the Prime Minister's Office has\r\n\r\nits  advantages  in  that  the competing  interests  of\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries can be more expeditiously resolved.\r\n\r\nSo  the  Anti-Pollution Unit will  continue  to  remain\r\n\r\nunder the Prime Minister's Office for the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Telok Blangah is right in that\r\n\r\nenforcement  authority  for the various  anti-pollution\r\n\r\nmeasures   and  control  are  vested  in  the   various\r\n\r\ndepartments  at the moment. For instance, the  question\r\n\r\nof bringing smoky\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuses  to  book comes under the ROV, and not  under  my\r\n\r\nMinistry. And the question of pollution in markets  and\r\n\r\ndirtying  of  markets, which was under the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth,  has  now been shifted to the Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.  That  is  another reason  why  the  Anti-Pollution  Unit  should best be left  under  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Office for the time being. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nmy  earlier  answer  to the Member  for  Telok  Blangah\r\n\r\nrefers  to  some of the main activities  of  the  Anti-Pollution Unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the Member for Anson, on air pollution, the\r\n\r\nUnit  has been successful in preventing an increase  in\r\n\r\nair pollution level despite rapid industrialisation  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  few  years.  Many  existing  factories  have\r\n\r\nimproved  on  their  house-keeping and  have  installed\r\n\r\ncontrol equipment to abate emissions of pollutants. The\r\n\r\nUnit  has  also  been  successful in  seeing  that  the\r\n\r\nestablishment and allocation of factories are done with\r\n\r\ndue  consideration to the environment,  especially  the\r\n\r\npollution problems. These early preventive measures are\r\n\r\nmore  effective and economical in the long run.  But  I\r\n\r\nwould also like to inform the Member for Anson that the\r\n\r\nAnti-Pollution Unit published a report in  1973,  which\r\n\r\nhas  been distributed to Members of Parliament, and  it\r\n\r\ncovers  in detail the activities of the Unit.  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest that, if he wants more details, he should refer\r\n\r\nto the Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control of air pollution from buses and taxis, of\r\n\r\ncourse, requires constant surveillance. The ROV and the\r\n\r\nTraffic Police have jurisdiction over this problem,  as\r\n\r\nI  have  said,  and many offenders have been  fined  in\r\n\r\ncourt  for  running vehicles emitting excessive  smoke.\r\n\r\nThe  problem now probably is to see that all the  buses\r\n\r\nare  on the move, and it is possible that in the  ROV's\r\n\r\nestimate  this  problem is to be given  first  priority\r\n\r\nrather than the problem of cutting down the emission of\r\n\r\nsmoke. Once there are enough buses, probably they  will\r\n\r\nthen  be  more  severe  upon offenders.  It  is  now  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  transporting the commuter or  moving  the\r\n\r\nbuses out of the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the real cause of black smoke\r\n\r\nactually lies with the running of diesel vehicles,  and\r\n\r\nit  is due to the lack of proper operation and lack  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  the  engine. If  a  diesel  engine  is\r\n\r\nmaintained regularly and properly, there is  no  reason\r\n\r\nfor it to emit black smoke. To a large extent, Sir, the\r\n\r\nproblem lies in the hands of the owners who should keep\r\n\r\ntheir  vehicles  in good mechanical  condition.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  the Member for Anson that with better transport\r\n\r\nservices  and management, the emission of  black  smoke\r\n\r\nwill be reduced significantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of anti-pollution campaigns, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to assure the Member for Anson that such campaigns\r\n\r\nwill be held from time to time to constantly remind the\r\n\r\npeople  of  the need to prevent pollution in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  of  their social responsibility to help Government\r\n\r\nin maintaining a clean and healthy environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

It is possible that they set up\r\n\r\nthe Unit earlier and asked for money later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the very fact that the Minister for the\r\n\r\nEnvironment is replying to this amendment bears out the\r\n\r\nfact that the Unit should be under the Ministry of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment, and not the Prime Minister's Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindasamy, I have stretched the\r\n\r\nguillotine time to well past 3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P.

This accounts for about\r\n\r\n27  per cent of the total expenditure, and ranks second\r\n\r\nplace to all the Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully appreciate that the Government has to\r\n\r\nallocate  such  a big sum of money for Defence,  and  I\r\n\r\nagree that this is necessary because, as an independent\r\n\r\nand sovereign State, we must establish in our country a\r\n\r\nstrong  defence  system  and structure  to  ensure  our\r\n\r\nsafety,  security  and development.  Without  security,\r\n\r\nthere will not be any development. But with security we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  attract foreign  investments,  thus\r\n\r\nincreasing  our prosperity. This is necessary.  So  the\r\n\r\ncitizens   of  Singapore  quite  understand   why   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has to adopt such a policy. There  are  very\r\n\r\nfew  critics in Singapore against such a policy and  if\r\n\r\nthere  is any criticism at all I think such a criticism\r\n\r\nis  based  on misunderstanding or lack of understanding\r\n\r\nof the policies and the needs of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, undoubtedly under the enlightened\r\n\r\nleadership of our Government and the patriotic  support\r\n\r\nof  the people, there will be better performance  among\r\n\r\nour  defence  personnel.  I would  like  to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to pay tribute to the national servicemen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  have given their help to the rural people.  In  my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  Sembawang, there are a number  of  roads\r\n\r\nwhich  have been made up or repaired with the  help  of\r\n\r\nthe   national  servicemen,  under  the  gotong  royong\r\n\r\nsystem.  The spirit of co-operation and help  from  the\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen  have  already  established   good\r\n\r\nrelations  between  them and the people  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in the rural areas. Sir, with  continuing\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  national service and national  defence\r\n\r\nand  the  greater discipline displayed by our  national\r\n\r\nservicemen in peace-time as evident now, we must create\r\n\r\nmore  opportunities  for them to display  and  manifest\r\n\r\ntheir  co-operative  spirit. I hope that  consideration\r\n\r\nwill  be  given  to set up a productive  unit  for  our\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen so that, in addition  to  national\r\n\r\nservice  and military training, they can be engaged  in\r\n\r\nproductive  processes, e.g, in agriculture  where  they\r\n\r\ncan do animal husbandry, vegetable farming, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding all that I have said in praise of\r\n\r\nour national servicemen and the defence system, I think\r\n\r\nthere   is  still  room  for  improvement  in   certain\r\n\r\nrespects.  Firstly,  there  is  the  request  from  the\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen to attend night  classes.  I  have\r\n\r\nreceived  requests and complaints from  them  regarding\r\n\r\ntechnical classes to be made available to them  in  the\r\n\r\nevenings.  They  would  like to improve  themselves  in\r\n\r\ntechnical  education  so  that  they  can  have  better\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when they applied for permission, their\r\n\r\napplications were turned down. The reason  is  that  if\r\n\r\nthey want to attend such technical classes they have to\r\n\r\nsign  on  for a further service of three years.  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  of this condition which they are not  prepared\r\n\r\nto  accept that they are denied the opportunity to seek\r\n\r\nfurther  training  in technical education.  This  is  a\r\n\r\npity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I appreciate that at the present\r\n\r\nstage  of  our industrial development we need more  and\r\n\r\nmore  trained  technical  personnel.  Therefore,  those\r\n\r\nnational servicemen who are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterested  and  who  have the capacity  to  learn  and\r\n\r\nbenefit from technical education should be given  every\r\n\r\nencouragement  and  opportunity to improve  themselves.\r\n\r\nToo  stringent conditions should not be imposed on them\r\n\r\nif  we  are to assist them in furthering their training\r\n\r\nin  technical  education. After having completed  their\r\n\r\nnational  service, they will be able to join the  ranks\r\n\r\nof our industrial workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, there is the question of the call-up of\r\n\r\nbrothers.  I  have  received  complaints  from  certain\r\n\r\nfamilies, each with two or three sons, that their  boys\r\n\r\nwere called up for national service at the same time of\r\n\r\nthe  year.  This  has  caused great  inconvenience  and\r\n\r\nfinancial hardship to them. The call-up for such  cases\r\n\r\nshould  be  staggered.  For instance,  the  second  son\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  called  up until  the  first  son  has\r\n\r\ncompleted  his  national service. I  think  this  is  a\r\n\r\nlegitimate   request   worthy  of  our   consideration.\r\n\r\nHowever, such consideration has not always been  given.\r\n\r\nApplications  had been made but they were  turned  down\r\n\r\nmost  of  the time. I would like the Minister concerned\r\n\r\nto    consider    such   applications   sympathetically\r\n\r\nparticularly   those   cases   where   the   boys   are\r\n\r\ncontributing to the maintenance of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there is the question of allocation of duties\r\n\r\nfor   national   service  trainees.  I  have   received\r\n\r\ncomplaints that, after three months of basic  training,\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  trainees have been posted to  the  wrong\r\n\r\nunits.  Trainees who are physically weak are posted  to\r\n\r\nthe  Combat  Division  or the Artillery  Division,  and\r\n\r\nthose inexperienced in driving are given driving duties\r\n\r\nor  are  forced  to  learn driving. This  inappropriate\r\n\r\nallocation of duties has given rise to discontent among\r\n\r\nparents. A lot of traffic accidents have resulted  from\r\n\r\nthis situation. I would like the Minister concerned  to\r\n\r\nlook   into  the  matter  to  ensure  that  responsible\r\n\r\nofficers  will be detailed to properly allocate  duties\r\n\r\nfor the national servicemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, the question of recreational and\r\n\r\ncultural  activities. I am glad to say that  two  years\r\n\r\nago in this House when I suggested that there should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  recreational  and cultural activities  among  the\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen,  the  Minister  agreed  to   this\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  In the camps now cultural and recreational\r\n\r\nactivities are conducted from time to time so that  the\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen can have proper  recreation  after\r\n\r\ntheir training and during their leisure hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January this year I was invited to attend an\r\n\r\nevening  function at the Changi Camp.  I  noticed  that\r\n\r\nsome  of  the national servicemen were quite  talented.\r\n\r\nBut some of the items in the programme were contributed\r\n\r\nby  artistes  from  outside. I do  not  think  this  is\r\n\r\nappropriate because the songs they sang were  not  very\r\n\r\nhealthy. For example, one of them sang a song entitled.\r\n\r\n\"We  should not pluck a wild flower by the road  side.\"\r\n\r\nThis  type  of  song  should not be introduced  to  the\r\n\r\nnational servicemen during a cultural show. I think all\r\n\r\nprogrammes  should be properly conducted and  organised\r\n\r\nby  the  recreational and cultural units in the various\r\n\r\ncamps. If artistes are to be invited from outside, they\r\n\r\nshould  come  from  healthy cultural  organisations  or\r\n\r\nchoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for a long time\r\n\r\nthere  have  been no statements regarding international\r\n\r\nagreements.  May  I  know  the  state  of  the  defence\r\n\r\nagreements,  and to what extent will they  involve  our\r\n\r\nSingapore Armed Forces?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is known that Australia had pulled out quite a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  its  troops from Singapore.  I  wonder  how\r\n\r\neffective are the ANZUK forces at the moment, and  what\r\n\r\nis  the extent of its future plans, in terms of defence\r\n\r\ntraining and common interest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to touch upon the intake of\r\n\r\nnational servicemen. What is the present procedure  for\r\n\r\nthe  call-up  of  national  servicemen?  I  raise  this\r\n\r\nquestion  because I have observed that there  are  many\r\n\r\npotential  boys  who  are  eligible  and  are   eagerly\r\n\r\nawaiting for the Central Manpower Base to call them up.\r\n\r\nAnd  there  are others who are still lingering  on  the\r\n\r\nstreets  and  who may also be called up. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare many who are hoping for a postponement for a couple\r\n\r\nof  years due to some reasons, but they are the ones to\r\n\r\nbe called in first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that food supplied to the national\r\n\r\nservicemen is being wasted. This could probably be  due\r\n\r\neither to poor quality or to the fact that some of  the\r\n\r\nwell-to-do  boys could not be bothered about  the  army\r\n\r\nfood. Could the Minister say something on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heard that at present there is a lack of\r\n\r\nunderstanding between officers and senior NCOs  in  the\r\n\r\narmy. Discipline to a certain extent has been affected.\r\n\r\nCould  more power be given to senior NCOs and corporals\r\n\r\nto  deal  with their subordinates? The NCOs  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  opportunity to lead and train  their  men.  This\r\n\r\nwill  help them in times of crisis if the officers  are\r\n\r\nbeing  pinned down. Furthermore, I observe  that  there\r\n\r\nare  inadequate recreational facilities in  some  camps\r\n\r\nfor  these young men. Could something be done  to  help\r\n\r\nthe men?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, it was reported in the press that the army\r\n\r\nwould  assist  with  its helicopter services  to  fight\r\n\r\nagainst  fire  in high-rise buildings. Could  the  same\r\n\r\nservices  be extended to the Police Force to help  them\r\n\r\nfight against crime?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the expenditure for\r\n\r\nDefence  keeps  going  up from year  to  year.  We  are\r\n\r\nspending much more money every year. From time to  time\r\n\r\nI  have  been  wondering why we need  to  increase  our\r\n\r\nDefence  expenditure  when, in  actual  fact,  we  have\r\n\r\nfriendly neighbours around us. Is it necessary  for  us\r\n\r\nto  increase  our Defence expenditure, when  the  money\r\n\r\ncould  be utilised in many other ways to promote better\r\n\r\nrelationship  among the citizens in  Singapore?  Bigger\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the  world  today  are  lessening  their\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on defence, but a small nation  like  ours\r\n\r\nkeeps on increasing it as the years go by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will deal with the\r\n\r\nvarious  points  which  have been  raised  by  Members.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Member for Sembawang. He has recommended\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  soldiers be put to productive work, such  as  the\r\n\r\nrearing  of  poultry  and  pigs  and  the  growing   of\r\n\r\nvegetables.  He is under the assumption  that  soldiers\r\n\r\nhave  nothing  to do. Actually they have a  very  heavy\r\n\r\ntraining  programme.  When  they  finish  their   basic\r\n\r\ntraining,  they go on to training at platoon level,  so\r\n\r\nmuch so that their working hours are much more than the\r\n\r\nnormal  working hours of civilians. For instance,  they\r\n\r\nhave  to do night training three times a week.  So  how\r\n\r\nare they to get time off to rear pigs and poultry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as for night classes, he said he has received\r\n\r\nrepresentations from national servicemen  who  want  to\r\n\r\nimprove  themselves by attending night classes so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  upgrade their technological  skills.  He  is\r\n\r\nunder the impression that when these requests are made,\r\n\r\nthey are often turned down. Actually he is right there.\r\n\r\nAt one time we used to give the battalion commander the\r\n\r\nauthority to decide whether or not to release  soldiers\r\n\r\nfor  night classes. Of course, it is very admirable  of\r\n\r\nyoung  men  to want to improve themselves by  attending\r\n\r\nnight  classes.  However, the number  grew  bigger  and\r\n\r\nbigger,  and  we decided to make a check  on  what  was\r\n\r\nhappening.  We  found that most of them were  having  a\r\n\r\nglorious time. Most of those who attended these classes\r\n\r\ndid  not pass their examinations. Of course, there were\r\n\r\nmany  who never attended any classes at all! The system\r\n\r\nnow  is that any soldier who wants to take time-off  at\r\n\r\nnight  to attend technical education courses will  have\r\n\r\nto  apply formally. Their applications will be examined\r\n\r\nand   scrutinised  by  the  Technical   Department   of\r\n\r\nLogistics  Division.  If  it is  a  genuine  case,  the\r\n\r\napplicant  not only gets time-off but MINDEF subsidises\r\n\r\nhis  fees  and  provides him with books.  That  is  the\r\n\r\npresent system. If it is a genuine case, he gets it. If\r\n\r\nit  is not, as in the case of those national servicemen\r\n\r\nwho  had gone to see the Member for Sembawang, they are\r\n\r\nrejected, and quite rightly so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he also wants brothers to be treated kindly,\r\n\r\ni.e, if there are several brothers in the family, then\r\n\r\nthey should not be conscripted together. I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsee the logic of it. The principle is this. Whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  he  has  brothers serving in the Army,  is  not  a\r\n\r\nrelevant point. The point is, if by taking a young  man\r\n\r\nout  from  whatever  he is doing  and  putting  him  in\r\n\r\nuniform  to  do his national service, this  results  in\r\n\r\nhardship  for the family, such cases are considered  by\r\n\r\nan Appeals Committee. And if facts are established that\r\n\r\ngenuine   hardship   arises,  the   Appeals   Committee\r\n\r\ninvariably allows the appeal. Indeed, each year we have\r\n\r\nabout  300  to  500  appeals approved  by  the  Appeals\r\n\r\nCommittee.  So there is machinery for considering  this\r\n\r\nkind of situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the posting of servicemen to vocations,\r\n\r\nthere  are vocations which nobody likes to do.  Cooking\r\n\r\nis one of them. Driving is another. The life of an army\r\n\r\ndriver is a very hard one. He is among the first to get\r\n\r\nup  in the morning and the last to go to sleep, because\r\n\r\nhe  has  got to clean the trucks before he is  finished\r\n\r\nfor  the  day.  Here  again,  I  urge  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang to bear this in mind: by all means listen  to\r\n\r\ntheir grouses with great sympathy, but do not always be\r\n\r\ntaken in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the music and drama show which he attended,\r\n\r\nhe  complains that certain songs sung by foreign  song-stresses  should not have been allowed. There  are  two\r\n\r\npoints  of view on this. One is that of the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang,  and the other is that of the  soldiers  who\r\n\r\nlistened   to  these  songs.  And  as  he  would   bear\r\n\r\ntestimony,  the  songs he complained  of  received  the\r\n\r\nloudest applause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson claims that there is a waste of\r\n\r\nfood.  I  am not going to deny that there is  waste  of\r\n\r\nfood in any of the battalion camps. But I do ask him to\r\n\r\nsupply  me with details of what wastes there  are,  and\r\n\r\nwhen  and where, because we are fairly stringent  about\r\n\r\nthis. We have inspectors to go round from camp to camp,\r\n\r\nand  we  are  keeping  this subject  under  very  close\r\n\r\nsupervision.  Any information he gives about  waste  of\r\n\r\nfood  in any particular camp will be studied and action\r\n\r\nwill be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards inadequate recreational facilities that the\r\n\r\nMember  complains of, I am afraid he  has  grounds  for\r\n\r\nthis.  I  am  not  going to say that we  have  adequate\r\n\r\nrecreational facilities in all our camps. In fact,  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of  recreational facilities in all  battalion\r\n\r\ncamps is inadequate. But that is the way it is. How are\r\n\r\nwe  going  to  have a swimming pool for each  battalion\r\n\r\ncamp?  How  are we going to have football  fields?  All\r\n\r\nthese  cost  money.  The Member  for  Potong  Pasir  is\r\n\r\ncomplaining  that we are spending too much on  defence.\r\n\r\nBut I will deal with that point later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of helicopters to fight crimes, I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Member  for Anson is an  ardent  reader  of\r\n\r\ndetective  comic  strips. I do not see how  helicopters\r\n\r\ncan  be  used  to  fight  crime. Helicopters  are  very\r\n\r\nexpensive and a dangerous form of transportation. It is\r\n\r\nnot  to be recommended other than in real cases of dire\r\n\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir asks: why not decrease the\r\n\r\ndefence  expenditure? Why are we spending so  much?  No\r\n\r\none  wants to spend money on defence, neither I  myself\r\n\r\nnor  Members  here. Unfortunately, these are  what  one\r\n\r\nstatistician,   studying   categories   of   Government\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  calls \"regrettable necessities\".  If  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Potong  Pasir  has  studied  the  figures\r\n\r\nclosely,  he  will have noticed that  the  increase  in\r\n\r\ndefence   expenditure  is  the  smallest  of  all   the\r\n\r\nMinistries. The increase in this financial  year  asked\r\n\r\nby my Ministry comes to rather less than 2\ufffd per cent as\r\n\r\nagainst  some 10 to 15 per cent increase in the general\r\n\r\nrun of Ministries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has\r\n\r\nnot  answered  two of my questions: one  regarding  the\r\n\r\nAustralian pull-out from the ANZUK forces and the other\r\n\r\non the power given to the NCOs to control their men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I did not say anything about\r\n\r\nthe  ANZUK forces because I did not understand what the\r\n\r\nMember was saying!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

I wonder how effective the ANZUK  forces  is\r\n\r\nat  the moment, and to what extent are its future plans\r\n\r\nin terms of defence training and common interest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the Member for Anson should\r\n\r\naddress his question to the ANZUK Commander! ANZUK does\r\n\r\nnot  come  under  me.  Seriously  speaking,  ANZUK   is\r\n\r\nrethinking the whole position, and no doubt  they  will\r\n\r\ncome up with new plans in course of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the NCOs, here again I must ask the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson's pardon if I did not get him right. He says that\r\n\r\nsenior NCOs have not been given adequate powers.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot quite sure what he means by that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> They cannot control the privates.\r\n\r\nIf  they have more powers, then they can control  them.\r\n\r\nOtherwise there will be no discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think I understand what the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson is trying to get at. What happened was\r\n\r\nin the past NCOs, mostly national service corporals, in\r\n\r\ntheir  exasperation against recruits who kept on making\r\n\r\nthe same mistakes or not obeying orders or whatever  it\r\n\r\nwas,  took  upon  themselves to inflict  punishment  of\r\n\r\nvarious  kinds,  many  of which were  contrary  to  the\r\n\r\nregulations. So it was made very clear to them that  if\r\n\r\nthey  continued to inflict illegal forms of  punishment\r\n\r\non  soldiers under their command, they would  be  court\r\n\r\nmartialled. And they were accordingly court  martialled\r\n\r\nand  sternly punished, as I think they should. But that\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean  that the NCOs do not  have  powers  to\r\n\r\ninflict  punishment.  Punishment  must  be  meted   out\r\n\r\naccording to the rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbefore I withdraw my amendment I have a question to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister. This relates to our national  servicemen\r\n\r\nand national consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  feel  that this is a long-term question which cannot\r\n\r\nbe  resolved  easily  within  a  short  time,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister has been paying much attention to this problem\r\n\r\nof   national  consciousness  and  patriotism  of   our\r\n\r\nnational servicemen. Thus if our national servicemen do\r\n\r\nnot  have a strong sense of nationalism and patriotism,\r\n\r\nhow can we expect them to sacrifice for the country  or\r\n\r\nto  serve  the country? What is their position  now  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  national consciousness and patriotism?  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, generally speaking, they are quite good in this\r\n\r\nrespect.  They  obey their superior's orders  and  they\r\n\r\nabide  by the regulations. But what are they internally\r\n\r\nin  their  own personal feelings and consciousness?  It\r\n\r\nseems  that  they have not acquired a strong  sense  of\r\n\r\nnationalism or patriotism. This could be assessed  from\r\n\r\ntheir  conversation. Once I visited their barracks  and\r\n\r\nsome  soldiers were talking to their officers who  were\r\n\r\nmainly pre-University or University students. From  the\r\n\r\ntalk  I  gathered  the impression that  they  are  most\r\n\r\nconcerned as to whether their studies will be  affected\r\n\r\nafter  their discharge from national service. They  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  their  future prospects  after  their\r\n\r\nperiod of training. They are more concerned with  their\r\n\r\npersonal problems than with their contribution, if any,\r\n\r\nto  nation  building or defence. Of course, this  shows\r\n\r\nthat  the  content  of the training courses  lacks  the\r\n\r\ninculcation of national consciousness in the  minds  of\r\n\r\nour national servicemen. We should inculcate in them  a\r\n\r\nsense  of citizenship and other good points and virtues\r\n\r\nin order to make them good soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nbrought  up  what  seems to me a very  important  point\r\n\r\nwhich  indeed may constitute a serious weakness in  the\r\n\r\nArmy,  that  is,  the spirit of national consciousness,\r\n\r\nthe  willingness  to take up arms  on  behalf  of  your\r\n\r\ncountry. However, if he believes that this is something\r\n\r\nthat  Army commanders can bring about in two years,  he\r\n\r\nis  asking  for  something  quite  impossible.  I  have\r\n\r\ndiscussed  this matter with Army commanders,  and  they\r\n\r\nsay that this is something they expect to be cultivated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  schools, in homes and indeed in general society. If\r\n\r\nwe  get a situation where a young man turning up in the\r\n\r\nArmy  knows  nothing about these matters  and  believes\r\n\r\nthat  what  matters most is his own personal  interest,\r\n\r\nthere  is  very little that we can do in two  years  to\r\n\r\nchange  that  kind  of  attitude. We  cannot  brainwash\r\n\r\nsoldiers in two years' time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did an interesting experiment in May last year. I\r\n\r\ninvited six or seven Members of Parliament taking turns\r\n\r\nto   visit   various  battalion  camps   and   training\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  Those  who  took  part  remember   their\r\n\r\nexperiences very well. The idea, first, was to give the\r\n\r\nMPs  -many of them were young MPs - a chance to see the\r\n\r\nsoldiers and get the feel of their attitudes, how  they\r\n\r\nare  taking  to  national service, what their  problems\r\n\r\nare, and that sort of thing. That is for the MPs to get\r\n\r\nto know the Army. The other part of the exercise is for\r\n\r\nthe  MPs to tell the soldiers just what the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  has been saying, that is, the importance  of\r\n\r\ntheir  work, the need to defend the nation, patriotism,\r\n\r\nand  so  on  and  so  forth. I paid  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nattention   to  this  exercise  and  had   it   closely\r\n\r\ndocumented.  After a month the MPs and myself  came  to\r\n\r\nthe  conclusion  that  it was  not  a  very  profitable\r\n\r\nexercise.  The  soldiers asked all kinds  of  questions\r\n\r\nwhich  the  MPs consider quite trivial, like  too  many\r\n\r\nguard  duties,  no time-off, eggs not properly  cooked,\r\n\r\nlavatories out of order, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the impact of the MPs on the soldiers, I am\r\n\r\nafraid  my  officers  were  rather  polite.  Those  who\r\n\r\nrecorded the effect of the exchanges said that the  MPs\r\n\r\nwere  very sincere and very eloquent. But they did  not\r\n\r\nknow what effect they had on the soldiers. However,  if\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Sembawang feels very  strongly  about\r\n\r\nthis,  perhaps we can arrange for him to be in  a  road\r\n\r\nshow  some  time  so that he can give  a  talk  to  the\r\n\r\nsoldiers.

The  first\r\n\r\nrelates  to the People's Defence Force. I believe  that\r\n\r\nthe PDF is now only a small force, consisting of almost\r\n\r\nas  many officers and senior NCOs as there are  men.  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  told that the PDF is a sort of a descendant\r\n\r\nof  the  SVC, the Singapore Volunteer Corps of which  I\r\n\r\nbelieve our respected Minister of Defence was himself a\r\n\r\nmember. Many well-known Singaporeans, including  a  few\r\n\r\nof  our  senior military officers, are proud  of  their\r\n\r\nconnections with the volunteers. We have a full-fledged\r\n\r\nmilitary  establishment based principally  on  national\r\n\r\nservice  but  there are those who are  asking  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening  to  the  PDF.  The SVC  has  given  us  some\r\n\r\ninteresting  traditions of volunteer military  service,\r\n\r\nand  I  wonder whether the Minister could say something\r\n\r\nthat   might  resolve  the  ambiguous  situation   that\r\n\r\nprevails at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point relates to the accident that recently\r\n\r\nhappened at SAFTI, when people were killed and injured.\r\n\r\nI  wonder  whether the Minister would  like  to  say  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  more about this accident, if  he  has  the\r\n\r\ntime, of course -- whether there is any fault that  may\r\n\r\nbe  attributed  to  people or agency  so  that  further\r\n\r\nadditional  precautionary  measures  can  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nensure greater insurance against such accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to refer to the road show,\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily the one which the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nhad a look at. Personally I was extremely impressed  by\r\n\r\nwhat I saw. I could not understand what those actresses\r\n\r\nwere singing, but the part which I saw and understood I\r\n\r\nappreciated  profoundly. I might  mention  particularly\r\n\r\nthe  humorous sketches. I think they are of  a  quality\r\n\r\nthat  may  be  appropriate for  presentation  over  our\r\n\r\ntelevision. Some of the jokes are somewhat earthy,  but\r\n\r\nI  am sure our civilian population will be able to take\r\n\r\nthem.  I  was rather struck by the originality  of  the\r\n\r\nsatire   and  the  wit.  I  would  imagine   that   the\r\n\r\npresentation  of such humorous sketches over  TV  would\r\n\r\nalso  serve  to  introduce  parents  to  some  of   the\r\n\r\nsituations  which  our young servicemen  encounter  and\r\n\r\ndeal  with, perhaps in very characteristic fashion when\r\n\r\ninducted into national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the road show I was also struck by the vibrant way\r\n\r\nin which the English language was used, and by the rich\r\n\r\nnew  coinages the SAF are contributing to  the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage. Let me give a few examples, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThe  word khoon means sleep, as in the sentence,  \"Hey,\r\n\r\nsoldier,  you are good at khooning even with your  eyes\r\n\r\nopen, huh!\" The word gabra means a fumbler; a skiver is\r\n\r\na  person who specialises in getting off the hook,  one\r\n\r\nwho is not willing to do the job, or one who sticks  to\r\n\r\nthe   same   universal   army   principle   of   never-volunteering.  Maybe that might affect  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nreply  when  he talks about the PDF! Then we  have  the\r\n\r\nfrequent  use  of  the  word  sabo,  which  means,   to\r\n\r\nundermine another person's status. I would suggest that\r\n\r\nwe encourage some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  our  young  research lecturers at the  University's\r\n\r\nDepartment of English to look a little bit more closely\r\n\r\ninto  this very healthy contribution of the SAF to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the English language in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> In the PDF there are two\r\n\r\nbattalions, the 10th and 15th.

I  hope  the  volunteering  tradition  will\r\n\r\ncontinue, and I agree with a lot of what the Member has\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the SAFTI accident, a Board of Inquiry has\r\n\r\nbeen  set up and it has just completed its findings.  A\r\n\r\nfull  statement  will be made shortly  on  this  tragic\r\n\r\nepisode. Briefly, the Board found that the most  likely\r\n\r\ncause  of the accident was a defect in the fuse of  the\r\n\r\nmortar bomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the comic sketches, I am glad the Member\r\n\r\nenjoyed  it.

We only hope that in this all-important  matter\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will try to expedite movement  towards\r\n\r\ninternational standards.

Is  it  being  fully\r\n\r\nutilized?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been some time now since\r\n\r\nmetrication was introduced. We welcome this attempt and\r\n\r\npraise  the Government for its good efforts. I  observe\r\n\r\nthat  many  people still do not know  how  to  convert,\r\n\r\nthough  there is a conversion table in every  shop.  It\r\n\r\nwould  appear that the people are slow to use  it.  The\r\n\r\nmetrication campaign should be revitalised to  see  its\r\n\r\neffects  truly felt. Even the kilometre  signs  on  the\r\n\r\nroad are hardly noticed by the people, though they  are\r\n\r\nprominently  placed. This campaign should be  continued\r\n\r\nwith  better force and effect. Have new equipments been\r\n\r\nprovided for the purpose? How far has metrication  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  in markets and provision stores?  We  still\r\n\r\nfind  the  people  and  shopkeepers  trading  with  the\r\n\r\nimperial  system, for example, rice is being  dealt  in\r\n\r\nkatis,  sugar in pounds, etc. How far has  the  daching\r\n\r\nbeen  eliminated  in the markets, as  there  have  been\r\n\r\nreports  of  a  lot of manipulation of the instruments?\r\n\r\nHas  the  Minister  thought of  introducing  any  other\r\n\r\nreliable  instruments with metric markings which  would\r\n\r\nbe easier to work on?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our work in developing\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a  brain  centre  is  progressing   very\r\n\r\nsmoothly.  If we have not been talking a lot about  our\r\n\r\nwork, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  because our brains have been resting or  sleeping,\r\n\r\nbut  because  our  brains have  been  doing  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nthinking  and planning. It is quite true that Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  have  to live on its ability to export  soft-ware\r\n\r\nand   hard-ware  services,  and  we  do  this   through\r\n\r\neducation   in  post-secondary  schools  and   in   the\r\n\r\nuniversities.  This is one reason why  my  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nworking  very  closely with the universities,  together\r\n\r\nwith the Polytechnic and the Ministry of Education,  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping courses of study which will be of  relevance\r\n\r\nand use to the young people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has a misconception about the use\r\n\r\nof the Science Centre which is coming up in Jurong. The\r\n\r\nScience   Centre   essentially  will  stimulate   young\r\n\r\nstudents  and adults to be able to read a  little  more\r\n\r\nabout  the  application  of  scientific  principles  in\r\n\r\ntechnology.  It  is  due  to  be  completed  in   1975.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we are busy collecting exhibits from various\r\n\r\nindustrial  firms which will be shown at  this  Centre.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no central scientific facility in Singapore.\r\n\r\nOur  facilities  are  scattered in  many  branches  and\r\n\r\ndivisions  of  Government Ministries,  and  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  for  me  to  tell  the  Member  whether   the\r\n\r\nscientific  facilities  in Singapore  are  being  fully\r\n\r\nutilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to metrication, the strategy for 1974 is\r\n\r\nto  introduce  it  at  market  level,  that  is,  among\r\n\r\nconsumers.  To-date,  most Government  departments  and\r\n\r\nstatutory bodies have already completed the first phase\r\n\r\nof   metrication,  and  we  are  now  aiming  at   mass\r\n\r\nconsumers.  If  the Member for Anson had  been  to  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  on  Saturday night, he would have  seen  me  and\r\n\r\nofficials  of the Metrication Board trying to encourage\r\n\r\nthe  illiterate constituents in Toa Payoh  to  use  the\r\n\r\nmetric system. I do admit, together with the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson, that many people are still not very conscious of\r\n\r\nthe metric system. But if the Member for Anson can tell\r\n\r\nme whether one pound of mutton is cheaper than one kati\r\n\r\nof  it, or why he prefers to buy a metre of sari  to  a\r\n\r\nyard of sari\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor his wife, which is cheaper, then I will be able  to\r\n\r\nanswer him how widespread metrication is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be rest assured that my Ministry is doing its very\r\n\r\nbest  to  try to standardise the weights and  measures,\r\n\r\nbut  we  cannot avoid manipulation, whether we use  the\r\n\r\nimperial  weights  and measures or the  metric  system.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Metrication Board is discussing  with  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of daching manufacturers, so that they will  be\r\n\r\nable  to use the daching and yet use the metric system.\r\n\r\nThe  experiment is now in progress and, when completed,\r\n\r\nwe  will go out to the market and tell the hawkers  how\r\n\r\nto sell in grams and kilograms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This visit took place at a time when  there  was\r\n\r\ninternational  turbulence  in  those  countries.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  many people have paid much attention  to  this\r\n\r\nvisit  as it took place during the oil crisis.

We   should   also\r\n\r\nstrengthen   our  friendly  relationship   with   other\r\n\r\ncountries of the world. We should now pay attention  to\r\n\r\ncountries  in West Asia and extend a friendly  hand  to\r\n\r\nthem in order to set up ties in commercial and cultural\r\n\r\nfields,  so  that  this relationship  can  bring  about\r\n\r\nmutual  benefits.  I  would like to  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  there  are any more plans to  send  commercial\r\n\r\ndelegations to West Asian countries to make an  on-the-spot  study  and  analysis with a view to  establishing\r\n\r\nwider  commercial relationship and trade with  them.

I would like to\r\n\r\nask: How many kinds of economic activities or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplans have been implemented and completed? What kind of\r\n\r\nbenefits  have  been  derived  by  this  kind  of   co-operation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Undoubtedly, international situations are changing\r\n\r\nall  the  time. However, our foreign policy is that  of\r\n\r\nneutrality  and  non-alignment. We  have  a  very  able\r\n\r\nMinister   in  charge  of  relationships   with   other\r\n\r\ncountries. So we can rest assured that matters relating\r\n\r\nto  foreign affairs will be well looked after. However,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask him whether he has any  plans  to\r\n\r\nestablish new diplomatic missions and, if so, where.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nmany countries, whether Scandinavian or certain Western\r\n\r\ncountries,  travel formalities are being  progressively\r\n\r\nrelaxed or even withdrawn for the benefit of bona  fide\r\n\r\ntravellers  from these countries. This has  come  about\r\n\r\nbecause  of the cordial relationships existing  between\r\n\r\nsuch count ties. There was some discussion sometime ago\r\n\r\namong  ASEAN  countries on the need  for  regional  co-operation  on such matters. I wonder what progress  has\r\n\r\nbeen made so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have very often encouraged our citizens,\r\n\r\nparticularly  our  youths, to  travel  to  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries  in  order  to broaden  their  knowledge  and\r\n\r\noutlook.  Because of its close proximity, most  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  prefer  to travel to West Malaysia.  However,\r\n\r\nwith  the present restrictions imposed by the Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment,  many of us have been deterred from  making\r\n\r\nsuch  a trip to West Malaysia. We are aware of the long\r\n\r\nqueues  of  traffic  along  the  Johore  Causeway,  the\r\n\r\nbottleneck  at  the Malaysian Customs check-point,  and\r\n\r\nalso  at  the  Malaysian  High Commission  Office.  Our\r\n\r\ncitizens  have to fill up forms and obtain special  car\r\n\r\npermits   which  are  now  considered  unnecessary   in\r\n\r\ncountries  having friendly relationships  in  order  to\r\n\r\ntravel   to   West  Malaysia.  Because  of  its   close\r\n\r\nproximity, many of our citizens would like to travel to\r\n\r\nJohore  Bahru, not because of the special  film  shows,\r\n\r\nbut to see something different,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  example,  the  rubber  estates,  pineapple\r\n\r\nplantations,  tin mines and rural Malaysia.

Has\r\n\r\nSingapore    participated    effectively    in     this\r\n\r\norganisation? What are the various programmes in  which\r\n\r\nSingapore  has participated in? In order to keep  alive\r\n\r\nour  existence  in  the ASEAN group of  countries,  the\r\n\r\npeople  ought  to be told from time to time  about  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of ASEAN and our importance in this connection.\r\n\r\nA  campaign might be held. A special day could  be  set\r\n\r\naside, like the Commonwealth Day, calling it ASEAN  Day\r\n\r\nto  make  people aware of our membership in the  group.\r\n\r\nThis  will  also tell the people of the  importance  of\r\n\r\nbeing not only in the international limelight, but also\r\n\r\nin the regional set-up.

Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I always find it very difficult to\r\n\r\ndisagree   with   the  Member  for  Sembawang   because\r\n\r\ninvariably  he  begins his statement  by  unnecessarily\r\n\r\nexaggerating  my  successes  as  a  Foreign   Minister.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I think, out of deference to his  feeling,\r\n\r\nI would not disagree with him on that score!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the number of points and questions he has\r\n\r\nraised  with  respect to my tour  of  West  Asia,  that\r\n\r\nmatter  has already been dealt with in my reply to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon Gardens a few days ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question by the Member for Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nabout greater travel facilities to West Malaysia, first\r\n\r\nof  all, I would like to say that every country has the\r\n\r\nright to regulate how many people should be allowed  to\r\n\r\nenter  the  country and how it should  be  -  i.e, its\r\n\r\nimmigration  rules and regulations. However,  they  are\r\n\r\ngood  and  necessary regulations, just as we  ourselves\r\n\r\nhave  immigration regulations to regulate, to a certain\r\n\r\nextent,  the free flow of people from West Malaysia  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and vice versa. So we should not  query  the\r\n\r\nright of any country to impose whatever regulations  it\r\n\r\nthinks fit because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  are  so  many considerations, from  security  to\r\n\r\nadministrative problems. Having said that, I agree with\r\n\r\nthe Member for Toa Payoh that greater liberalisation of\r\n\r\nthese  regulations  both from  our  neighbour  in  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia and us, would be to the good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these problems, I think, arise Out of the fact\r\n\r\nthat  the flow of traffic is very considerable.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  like Malaysians or Singaporeans going to Japan  or\r\n\r\nthe  United States. It is a daily affair. Thousands  of\r\n\r\npeople  go  across daily, and we have  a  rather  small\r\n\r\nCauseway  which was built for the days when there  were\r\n\r\nno  immigration regulations between the two  countries.\r\n\r\nBut  1 hope that once the Causeway is widened, then the\r\n\r\nadministrative  controls which are now necessary  would\r\n\r\nbe  mitigated, or qualified, so that there would  be  a\r\n\r\ngreater  flow  of  traffic between Singapore  and  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia  as,  I  hope,  is being  done  in  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries  to regulate and make smoother the free  flow\r\n\r\nof people into the countries comprising ASEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the question of our relations with the\r\n\r\nPeople's Republic of China, I think it has been  stated\r\n\r\nbefore that it is our policy to establish friendly  and\r\n\r\ncloser  relations  with  all countries,  including  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Republic of China. But Members are well  aware\r\n\r\nof  the  situation prevailing in South-east  Asia,  and\r\n\r\nbecause  of  that  there  are certain  rather  delicate\r\n\r\nproblems  in regard to Singapore's position  in  South-east  Asia.  We have said that we would be prepared  to\r\n\r\nmove in this direction after our neighbouring countries\r\n\r\nhave   moved   first.   I  think  Members   are   quite\r\n\r\nsophisticated  enough  to  understand   why   this   is\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to our relations with Britain as a result of\r\n\r\nthe  advent of a Labour Government, in itself  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  does  not  materially alter  our  relations  with\r\n\r\nBritain   unless,   of  course,  the   new   Government\r\n\r\nintroduces  new policies which necessitate  adjustments\r\n\r\non  our part. But so far no material changes have taken\r\n\r\nplace in regard to foreign policy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  enunciated by the Labour Government. Therefore,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  I  know,  things are very much  as  they  were\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, two Members have raised questions in regard to a\r\n\r\ntopic  which  is  of  great  interest  to  all  of  us,\r\n\r\nincluding  my  Ministry, and that is, in what  way  has\r\n\r\nASEAN  benefited  us? What is the role  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nintends to play in ASEAN? Because of the importance  of\r\n\r\nASEAN  to  us  and  to the region, I hope  I  would  be\r\n\r\npermitted to say a bit more than I have done  in  other\r\n\r\ncases   because   apart  from  regional   organisations\r\n\r\nsponsored  by  the  United Nations in  Asia,  the  only\r\n\r\neffective  and coherent Asian regional organisation  is\r\n\r\nASEAN.  There  is  no comparable organisation  in  Asia\r\n\r\nwhere  a  number  of Asian countries work  together  to\r\n\r\npromote  regional co-operation. I think to this  extent\r\n\r\nASEAN is unique even in the history of Asia. In so  far\r\n\r\nas  progress is concerned, since its founding in  1967,\r\n\r\nit is my view that ASEAN has progressed far more in the\r\n\r\ndirection  of  regional  co-operation  than,  say,  the\r\n\r\nEuropean  Economic Community was able to do during  its\r\n\r\nfirst seven years. The rationale for ASEAN economic co-operation has been set out in the Report by the  United\r\n\r\nNations  team which completed its Report and  submitted\r\n\r\nto  us  in  April  1972. It covered trade,  industrial,\r\n\r\nmonetary  and financial co-operation, and  the  various\r\n\r\nASEAN  permanent committees -- there are  a  number  of\r\n\r\nthem  - have been studying this Report during the  past\r\n\r\ntwo years with a view to implementing gradually many of\r\n\r\nthe proposals put forward by the United Nations team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Singapore is concerned, it is convinced that\r\n\r\nregional  co-operation  is both rational  politics  and\r\n\r\nsound  economic  doctrine and that recent  events  have\r\n\r\ntended  to  confirm  the  fact of  inter-dependence  of\r\n\r\nnations, regionally as well as internationally. I think\r\n\r\nthe  oil  crisis and the difficulties of obtaining  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials cheaply are really a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreflection  of the growing inter-dependence of  nations\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN is not only our largest trading partner today,\r\n\r\nbut  it  also accounts for about a third of  our  total\r\n\r\ntrade.  ASEAN is becoming an important market  for  our\r\n\r\ndomestic exports which rose from $510 million  in  1969\r\n\r\nto  $717 million in 1972 and accounts for about 22  per\r\n\r\ncent  of  our  domestic exports to the  world.  We  are\r\n\r\nconscious,  therefore, that this increased  trade  with\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries is a consequence of vigorous  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  and  growing  prosperity  in  ASEAN  countries.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  regional  co-operation  can  accelerate\r\n\r\neconomic   growth  in  the  region,  then  it   is   in\r\n\r\nSingapore's interest to play a meaningful and  positive\r\n\r\nrole in ASEAN economic co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the positive steps Singapore and its\r\n\r\npartners  in ASEAN have taken during the past years,  I\r\n\r\nthink  Members are aware that economic action in  ASEAN\r\n\r\nis conducted through permanent committees which control\r\n\r\nvarious functions of ASEAN. There are a number of ASEAN\r\n\r\npermanent  committees.  But  the  major  ones  are  the\r\n\r\nPermanent  Committee  on  Commerce  and  Industry,  the\r\n\r\nPermanent     Committee    on    Transportation     and\r\n\r\nTelecommunications, the Permanent Committee  on  Social\r\n\r\nand  Cultural  Activities, the Permanent  Committee  on\r\n\r\nScience and Technology, and the Permanent Committee  on\r\n\r\nFood and Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Permanent Committee on Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry  has  met  once  since  the  last  ministerial\r\n\r\nmeeting  in  April last year. But a number of  projects\r\n\r\nwhich the Permanent Committee has initiated are now  in\r\n\r\nthe  process  of  being implemented or  completed.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, the ASEAN Products Display Centre in  Bangkok\r\n\r\nis  now  in the final stage of completion. The  working\r\n\r\ngroup  on trade liberalisation met in January 1974  and\r\n\r\nits work is continuing. The training of ASEAN personnel\r\n\r\nin  export promotion techniques is in an advanced stage\r\n\r\nof preparation. On shipping, the Permanent Committee on\r\n\r\nCommerce and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustry  has  finalised the draft  agreement  for  the\r\n\r\nfacilitation  of search for ships in distress  and  the\r\n\r\nrescue of survivors in ship accidents. There are expert\r\n\r\ngroups    on    bulk   shipping,   marine    pollution,\r\n\r\ncontainerisation, shipping statistics  and  information\r\n\r\nand   related  matters.  The  Permanent  Committee   on\r\n\r\nCommerce  and Industry is also undertaking tourism  and\r\n\r\nhas  a  five-year tourism marketing plan with an annual\r\n\r\nbudget  of  US$300,000 to promote ASEAN tourism.  These\r\n\r\nare   under  study  and  there  are  arrangements   for\r\n\r\nconcessional  air fare rates for ASEAN  representatives\r\n\r\ntravelling on ASEAN duties. It is intended to establish\r\n\r\nASEAN  centres  of  trade, investment  and  tourism  in\r\n\r\nWestern Europe. There are also plans for a Manpower and\r\n\r\nTraining  Facility  Survey on  ASEAN  regional  tourist\r\n\r\ndevelopment and plans for training of hotel  management\r\n\r\nand executives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Permanent Committee on Transportation and\r\n\r\nTelecommunications  has  set  up  a  sub-committee   to\r\n\r\nfinalise ASEAN telecommunications projects and to study\r\n\r\nregional  satellite communications system.  Also  under\r\n\r\nstudy  is the establishment of a common telephone  line\r\n\r\nsignal system. So, too, the Permanent Committee on Food\r\n\r\nand  Agriculture  is  convening  a  meeting  of  senior\r\n\r\nofficials   on  rice  and  a  meeting  of  experts   on\r\n\r\nfertilisers  and  pesticides. So,  too,  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Science and Technology is working  on  a\r\n\r\nproject  for soya bean processing and another  on  low-cost  protein-rich food for children. There will be  an\r\n\r\nexperts' meeting on ASEAN regional atlas and compendium\r\n\r\non climate statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a Special Committee has been established to\r\n\r\nco-ordinate ASEAN trade matters. This Committee is  now\r\n\r\nworking on a cumulative rule of origins for ASEAN which\r\n\r\nwill enable ASEAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries,  including Singapore, to take  advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe EEC GSP requirements. The special committee is also\r\n\r\nstudying  the  implications of the 1974  GSP  offer  in\r\n\r\norder  to  put  up  proposals for more concessions  and\r\n\r\nimprovements in the 1975 GSP offer. It seems, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthough   the  ASEAN  progress  was  rather   slow   and\r\n\r\nimperceptible  during the first four or five  years,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  pace  of co-operation on specific  projects\r\n\r\ntended to increase and gather momentum during the  last\r\n\r\ntwo  or three years. I am quite sure that in the coming\r\n\r\nyears  if  nothing untoward happens, ASEAN  will  be  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  factor in the history  of  the  individual\r\n\r\ncountries comprising ASEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for giving\r\n\r\ndetailed answers to all the questions I have raised.

Nevertheless, I am of the  view\r\n\r\nthat  our  interests can be better served  by  our  own\r\n\r\nmissions  in  selected  countries  in  Western  Europe,\r\n\r\nEastern  Europe and West Asia which are  becoming  more\r\n\r\nand  more  important  in  relation  to  our  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion  and  foreign trade. The 15  Ambassadors  and\r\n\r\nHigh Commissioners we have are in many cases accredited\r\n\r\nto  more  than  one country. In the long-term  interest\r\n\r\nthis may not be desirable as they would not be able  to\r\n\r\ndo justice to their appointments. I am perturbed by the\r\n\r\nfact  that  at  least two of our embassies  abroad  are\r\n\r\nmanned by Charge d'Affaires, with vacancies of the  top\r\n\r\nposts  not  filled for a long period. When  will  these\r\n\r\nvacancies be filled?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Minister to inform the House how\r\n\r\nmany  of  our  Consulates abroad are  looked  after  by\r\n\r\nHonorary Consuls, and for what length of time have they\r\n\r\nbeen  Honorary Consuls? Has the Minister any  plans  to\r\n\r\nset up more Consulates of this nature?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Rahmat Bin Kenap Al-Haj (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker Sir, I would like to know the reason\r\n\r\nwhy  the  post  of  Ambassador in Cairo  has  not  been\r\n\r\nfilled. The post was vacated by Mr Lee Khoon Choy  when\r\n\r\nhe was transferred to the Republic of Indonesia. Why is\r\n\r\nit   that   the  Singapore  Government  has   not   yet\r\n\r\nestablished  embassies in Europe and in Arab  countries\r\n\r\nin  the Middle East? It is because Singapore has got no\r\n\r\nembassies in the Arab countries that Singapore  is  not\r\n\r\nknown by the large population of the Arab nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen  I  went  on a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia,  I  was\r\n\r\nasked  about Singapore by the Arabs who were  from  the\r\n\r\nArab  countries.  Most of them do not  know  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not  know whether Singapore is an independent\r\n\r\ncountry   or  a  colony.  They  know  about  Indonesia,\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  India  and  Pakistan  better  because  these\r\n\r\ncountries have embassies in the Arab countries.  If  we\r\n\r\ncall  to mind the Bukom incident and the damage  caused\r\n\r\nto some oil tanks in our country, the Arabs do not know\r\n\r\nthat   Singapore  is  an  independent   country   whose\r\n\r\npopulation  comprise  people of various  religions  and\r\n\r\nraces.  They still believe that Singapore is  a  colony\r\n\r\nbecause  there are Israeli soldiers in Singapore.  That\r\n\r\nis  why it is necessary for us to introduce our country\r\n\r\nto  the  Arab countries, especially those in the Middle\r\n\r\nEast, and to establish embassies in those countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

This year we are reserving  a\r\n\r\nlarge  sum of money for the purchase of properties  for\r\n\r\nforeign  missions.  The sum has  been  raised  from  $8\r\n\r\nmillion  last year to $25 million this year. I remember\r\n\r\nwhen  I paid a brief visit to Tokyo a few years ago,  I\r\n\r\ndiscovered that there was a piece of property which  we\r\n\r\ncould  have bought quite cheaply. But prices have  gone\r\n\r\nup  considerably by now. And the same may  be  said  of\r\n\r\nother places too. I think we should try and see whether\r\n\r\nthere  are  economic  advantages  in  our  purchase  of\r\n\r\nproperties  for  foreign missions, and  to  take  quick\r\n\r\nadvantage of these opportunities.

Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to take the point\r\n\r\nraised  by  the  Member  for Telok  Blangah  first.  He\r\n\r\nmentioned  about the small increase in  the  number  of\r\n\r\nheads  of missions, and asked whether or not more posts\r\n\r\nshould  be  created. The practice has  been  to  create\r\n\r\nposts  of Ambassadors only when a decision is taken  to\r\n\r\nestablish a mission in a foreign country. The  adoption\r\n\r\nof  this  practice  is  to ensure  that  the  Estimates\r\n\r\ncorrectly reflect the position projected for  the  next\r\n\r\nfinancial  year. The projection is generally  based  on\r\n\r\nperformance over the last three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973, the missions in Paris and Bonn were\r\n\r\nestablished  -  not  one, but  two.  The  two  posts  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  have  been  entered  in  the  Estimates   to\r\n\r\nregularise their creation by Establishment Warrant last\r\n\r\nyear.  Also,  I should like to invite the attention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Telok  Blangah  to  subhead  BA  2901\r\n\r\nentitled   \"Staff   and  expenses  for   New   Missions\r\n\r\nOverseas\".  The purpose of this subhead is  to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  the  emoluments of home-based officers,  including\r\n\r\nAmbassadors,  and the cost of running new  missions  as\r\n\r\nand   when  it  becomes  necessary  to  establish  such\r\n\r\nmissions  in foreign countries. Therefore, the creation\r\n\r\nof  more  posts  of Ambassadors really depends  on  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  to establish more missions abroad.  If  this\r\n\r\ndecision  is  taken,  then there is  no  difficulty  in\r\n\r\ncreating the additional posts, including those of heads\r\n\r\nof missions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's question regarding the number of\r\n\r\nHonorary  Consuls we have abroad, the  answer  is  two.\r\n\r\nThere  is  an Honorary Consul in Sweden and another  in\r\n\r\nZurich, Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Blangah also wanted to know\r\n\r\nwhen new appointments are to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

The  appointment   of   a   High\r\n\r\nCommissioner or Ambassador is made after a careful  and\r\n\r\nthorough  selection of candidates with the  personality\r\n\r\nand  skill to carry out the important functions of head\r\n\r\nof  mission. The process of selection necessarily takes\r\n\r\ntime  but  nominations  have  already  been  made,  and\r\n\r\nhopefully the existing vacant posts of Ambassadors  and\r\n\r\nHigh Commissioners will be filled during the course  of\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Telok Blangah and Geylang Serai\r\n\r\nmentioned about why there are not more new embassies in\r\n\r\nWest  Asia. When Singapore gained independence  on  the\r\n\r\n9th  of  August, 1965, the primary task  of  the  newly\r\n\r\ninstituted Foreign Ministry then Was to plan  carefully\r\n\r\nwhere missions should be established apart from gaining\r\n\r\nmembership  in  the United Nations. The setting  up  of\r\n\r\nmissions  and  maintaining them is a  costly  business.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   taking   into  consideration   Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy  in  the  early years of independence,  it  was\r\n\r\nessential  that  missions  should  be  established   in\r\n\r\ncarefully selected countries first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criterion then was that the political climate in\r\n\r\nthe  country must be conducive to the setting up  of  a\r\n\r\nmission   which   would  not  only  help   to   further\r\n\r\nSingapore's national interest but would also facilitate\r\n\r\ncommunications and exchange of views with the receiving\r\n\r\nState to the mutual interest of Singapore and the State\r\n\r\nconcerned.  For  the  sake  of  economy,  it  was  also\r\n\r\nessential  that  the  country should  be  strategically\r\n\r\nplaced,  thus facilitating communications and  exchange\r\n\r\nof  views  with  countries in the  region  through  the\r\n\r\nexpedience of multiple accreditation. Thus it was  that\r\n\r\nin  1966  missions were established in London to  cover\r\n\r\nnot  only  Great  Britain but also Western  Europe;  in\r\n\r\nCanberra  and Wellington to cover also other  countries\r\n\r\nin  the  Australian  region, and  so  on.  The  mission\r\n\r\nestablished in Cairo in 1967 was to cover the North\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfrican states and one of the Arab countries, which  is\r\n\r\nLebanon.   Indeed,   the   Ambassador   in   Cairo   is\r\n\r\nconcurrently  accredited  to  three  other   countries,\r\n\r\nnamely, Ethiopia, Yugoslavia and Pakistan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the rapid changes that have and are taking\r\n\r\nplace in the international scene, particularly in  West\r\n\r\nAsia,  have made it necessary for an assessment of  the\r\n\r\nadequacy or otherwise of our present representation  in\r\n\r\nWest Asia. This has led me to believe, especially after\r\n\r\nour  recent visit to the West Asian countries, that  it\r\n\r\nwill be to the mutual interest and benefit of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  West Asian countries themselves that two or  three\r\n\r\nmissions be set up in certain West Asian countries. But\r\n\r\nthe  setting  up of those missions has to  be  gradual,\r\n\r\nthat is to say, we could first set them up at consulate\r\n\r\nstatus  and  at  a  later stage raise them  to  embassy\r\n\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the second question posed by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Geylang Serai relating to the continued presence of\r\n\r\na  Charge d'Affaires instead of an Ambassador in Cairo,\r\n\r\nsince that Ambassador became our Ambassador in Jakarta,\r\n\r\nthe  Member may not be aware that it involves  time  to\r\n\r\nselect  a person with the necessary skill and qualities\r\n\r\nfor  appointment as Ambassador. As language is a  basic\r\n\r\ntool  of  a  diplomat,  the  problem  of  selecting  an\r\n\r\nAmbassador  to  the  Arab Republic of  Egypt  has  been\r\n\r\ncompounded  by  the  dearth of prominent  Arab-speaking\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore. However, efforts to  select  a\r\n\r\nsuitable person are still being made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's other questions such as why do we\r\n\r\nhave  very few foreign missions in Arab countries,  and\r\n\r\nhis  experience on his pilgrimage to Mecca where he was\r\n\r\nasked  by  Arabs he met in the holy city  as  to  where\r\n\r\nSingapore was, and whether it was independent or not, I\r\n\r\ncan  only  say that it is quite possible that not  only\r\n\r\nArabs  but also people of other nationalities  anywhere\r\n\r\nin  the  world  might  not  know  about  conditions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and whether or not it is independent.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think that Mecca\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  the only place where the people arc perhaps not  so\r\n\r\ninformed   or  ignorant  about  Singapore's   political\r\n\r\nstatus.  We can find as many such people all  over  the\r\n\r\nworld  as there are Singaporeans also, who are ignorant\r\n\r\nof  conditions  in other countries. In that  connection\r\n\r\nalso, it is known to all of us here that not only  have\r\n\r\nwe  not  got many representations or missions  in  Arab\r\n\r\ncountries other than Cairo and Beirut, but in fact,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore itself, there are only two representations or\r\n\r\nmissions  of Arab countries. They are the Arab Republic\r\n\r\nof  Egypt  and  Saudi Arabia, although many  more  Arab\r\n\r\ncountries exist not only in West Asia but also in North\r\n\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai also made reference to\r\n\r\nthe  attempted sabotage in Singapore by what he  called\r\n\r\nArabs.  They are, to be precise, Palestinians. He  said\r\n\r\nthat  possibly  they  came here  without  knowing  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  was independent, and that they attempted  to\r\n\r\nsabotage  the refineries at Pulau Bukom.  I  am  rather\r\n\r\nskeptical  of his reasons because the two Palestinians,\r\n\r\nall  of us know, were accompanied by two Japanese. They\r\n\r\ncame  in,  I  am told, with passports. I am  sure  that\r\n\r\nbefore  they came into Singapore they had gone to  some\r\n\r\nplace  to  get visas. Wherever they had gone  to,  they\r\n\r\nwould have found out that Singapore is independent.  To\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  two Arabs were ignorant of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindependence   would   be   perhaps   out   of   place,\r\n\r\nparticularly when they were with two Japanese Red  Army\r\n\r\nguerillas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that the Member made was that the\r\n\r\naction was directed towards Singapore. It is now common\r\n\r\nknowledge that the guerillas themselves said that their\r\n\r\naction   at  Pulau  Bukom  was  not  directed   against\r\n\r\nSingapore or the people of Singapore and that they  had\r\n\r\ndone  it to support the revolutionary struggle  of  the\r\n\r\nVietnamese people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one other point which the Member for Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai  had  made  which I cannot remember.  Perhaps  he\r\n\r\nmight want to raise it later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson mentioned about security. What\r\n\r\nsecurity measures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare being arranged at our missions abroad? The practice\r\n\r\nis to send an officer, trained in security, to missions\r\n\r\nas  soon as a chancery building has been rented out  or\r\n\r\npurchased.  His task is to study the physical  security\r\n\r\narrangement  required to make the chancery secure  from\r\n\r\nintrusion. In practically all our chanceries there is a\r\n\r\nstrong  room in which classified materials  are  safely\r\n\r\nkept.  Whenever  possible,  windows  and  doors  giving\r\n\r\naccess  to  the  chancery are reinforced by  installing\r\n\r\ngrills.  In  chanceries with a wall-fence,  strands  of\r\n\r\nbarbed  wire  have  been mounted on the  wall-fence  to\r\n\r\nprovide additional security. In certain missions  there\r\n\r\nare  officers trained in security amongst the Singapore\r\n\r\nstaff.  In  chanceries which are housed in a  block  of\r\n\r\noffices,  grill doors have been installed as a security\r\n\r\nmeasure,  but  generally there are security  guards  to\r\n\r\nlook  after the safety of a block of offices  in  which\r\n\r\nour chancery is housed, for example, our chanceries  in\r\n\r\nTokyo and Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is now under review the security system\r\n\r\nin existence in all our chanceries generally. A trained\r\n\r\nofficer is being sent to our missions for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThese  systems vary with the locality and  requirements\r\n\r\nof  the  owner of the building in which our  chanceries\r\n\r\nare  accommodated. If, by the expression \"to  intensify\r\n\r\nsecurity  arrangements\", the Member for  Anson  has  in\r\n\r\nmind  the  presence  in  our  chanceries  of  uniformed\r\n\r\nguards,  then  I  should like to point out  that  under\r\n\r\nArticle  22  of  the  Vienna Convention  on  Diplomatic\r\n\r\nRelations,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The receiving state is under a special duty to take\r\n\r\nall  appropriate steps to protect the premises  of  the\r\n\r\nmissions against intrusion or damage and to prevent any\r\n\r\ndisturbance of the peace of the missions or  impairment\r\n\r\nof its dignity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  the  Member  will appreciate that in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of Article 22 of the Vienna Convention,  it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be a good diplomatic move to post  our  own\r\n\r\nsecurity officers to missions. However, to allay  fears\r\n\r\nof  the  Member  for Anson about the  security  of  our\r\n\r\nchanceries abroad, I should like to state that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na review of the existing physical security arrangements\r\n\r\nin our missions has already begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Members asked why there were many Charge\r\n\r\nd'Affaires  manning our missions abroad  and  why  they\r\n\r\nshould   not  be  replaced  by  Ambassadors   or   High\r\n\r\nCommissioners.  The fact is that in  all  our  missions\r\n\r\nabroad  there  are  only  four  Charge  d'Affaires,  as\r\n\r\ncompared with a total of 16 heads of missions, that is,\r\n\r\nAmbassadors  and  High  Commissioners.  The  number  of\r\n\r\nCharge d'Affaires is therefore not unduly large.  There\r\n\r\nhave been considerable difficulties in finding suitable\r\n\r\ncandidates to head our overseas missions, and sometimes\r\n\r\nit  has been found that rather than have an ineffective\r\n\r\nhead  from  the  point of view of experience,  language\r\n\r\nqualifications  or administrative capabilities,  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter  to  have  a Charge d'Affaires who  is  properly\r\n\r\nqualified to carry out these important representational\r\n\r\nfunctions in the country to which he is accredited.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the inference might be that Charge d'Affaires are\r\n\r\nnot as effective as Ambassadors. Well, this need not be\r\n\r\nso,  whether they be our own Charge d'Affaires or those\r\n\r\nof  other countries accredited to Singapore. There are,\r\n\r\nfor example, several Charge d'Affaires in Singapore who\r\n\r\nhave been here for many years and they have carried out\r\n\r\ntheir  functions effectively. For example, from one  of\r\n\r\nthe  Arab countries themselves, although they  have  an\r\n\r\nembassy   here,  it  has  never  been  manned   by   an\r\n\r\nAmbassador. Ever since the embassy of the former United\r\n\r\nArab  Republic, now Arab Republic of Egypt, was set  up\r\n\r\nhere, they have always had a Charge d'Affaires as  head\r\n\r\nof  mission.  Again,  because of  the  difficulties  of\r\n\r\nfinding  suitable  ambassadors  and  also  because  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Foreign Service is a very young  one,  which\r\n\r\nwill  not for some time produce career officers to fill\r\n\r\nhead  of  mission  appointments,  it  is  desirable  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to appoint Charge d'Affaires. Because  of  its\r\n\r\nstatus  and  position, Charge d'Affaires can  be  found\r\n\r\nfrom  the  more  senior Foreign Service officers.  This\r\n\r\nsystem permits also the opportunity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Foreign  Service officers to gain  experience  and\r\n\r\nknowledge as well as the training necessary for them to\r\n\r\nbe  promoted to the higher appointments in the  Foreign\r\n\r\nService.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to standards and effectiveness, I am pleased\r\n\r\nto be able to inform the Member who raised the question\r\n\r\nthat  in  spite  of  the absence of a long  established\r\n\r\ntradition  of  diplomacy, our  diplomats  have  quickly\r\n\r\nacquired  the  expertise  and  experience  which   have\r\n\r\nenabled them very effectively to represent our national\r\n\r\ninterests  on  a  global  basis.  Our  diplomats   have\r\n\r\nexercised  a high degree of flexibility in the  use  of\r\n\r\nlimited manpower resources available to them. They have\r\n\r\ncontinued  to show themselves very capable of  reacting\r\n\r\npragmatically to international developments and in  the\r\n\r\nface   of   increasing  complexities  in  international\r\n\r\nrelations and diplomacy, our officers have successfully\r\n\r\nassumed  the  responsibilities of the modern  diplomat.\r\n\r\nTheir  objective assessment and appreciation  of  major\r\n\r\npolitical  trends have helped Singapore to  adjust  and\r\n\r\ncope  with  the tremendous changes in the  world  since\r\n\r\n1965.  The quality of our overseas missions is, by  any\r\n\r\nmeasure  of  international standard, satisfactory.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore   Foreign  Service  as  a  whole   has   made\r\n\r\nsignificant contributions to the political and economic\r\n\r\nwell-being of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

I\r\n\r\npresume  this  is for the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Office. This is a new provision.  Government\r\n\r\nhas taken over so many buildings from the British Armed\r\n\r\nForces,  and  these  are being rented  out  to  private\r\n\r\nindividuals  and companies. Can the Minister  therefore\r\n\r\ninform  the House as to why should our Government  rent\r\n\r\npremises  in  Singapore when it is one of  the  biggest\r\n\r\nlandlords  in  Singapore? To what  use  are  these  new\r\n\r\npremises  going to be put? Where are these premises  to\r\n\r\nbe rented?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in respect of subhead BA 2310, Rental of premises\r\n\r\nfor  Overseas Missions, this is the first time that the\r\n\r\nprovision appears in the Main Estimates, although it is\r\n\r\nindicated  that $1.79 million was appropriated  for  FY\r\n\r\n1973.  The appropriation for this year is $2.5 million.\r\n\r\nI  have also noticed that there is no appropriation  of\r\n\r\nfunds   in   the  Development  Estimates   for   either\r\n\r\nHeadquarters  or Overseas Missions. If we  are  renting\r\n\r\npremises in Singapore and overseas for the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs, would it not be more prudent to  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  possibility of purchasing suitable  premises\r\n\r\ninstead?  I  think this will cover what the Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong  was  trying to say earlier  on  under  a  wrong\r\n\r\nsubhead.   Everybody  knows,  Sir,  that  real   estate\r\n\r\nappreciates, but rentals once paid out is  money  lost.\r\n\r\nSir,  perhaps we may have some premises overseas  which\r\n\r\nwere bought prudently on our own, and if we do own land\r\n\r\nor property abroad, I would like to be enlightened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Ong Soo Chuan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I am indeed grateful to the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah  who has raised the question  with  good\r\n\r\nintention  and with much concern over the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs.  If  I  read him  correctly,  he  was\r\n\r\nworried  that the Government would have to  spend  more\r\n\r\nmoney  to purchase property or land overseas. The  same\r\n\r\nconcern was also expressed by the Member for Katong. If\r\n\r\nI remember correctly, Sir, three or four years ago, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Telok Blangah was kind enough to  persuade\r\n\r\nhis  good friend to purchase a piece of property  at  a\r\n\r\ntime when the price of houses was relatively much lower\r\n\r\nthan the present one. He was far-sighted. Unfortunately\r\n\r\nhis  friend  was short-sighted, or rather conservative.\r\n\r\nSo  now  the Member for Telok Blangah is living happily\r\n\r\nwith  his family in the house which he has bought at  a\r\n\r\ncheaper  price. But his unfortunate colleague  and  his\r\n\r\nfamily  who  did  not buy a house  then  has  to  share\r\n\r\naccommodation with others up till today. Therefore,  in\r\n\r\nthe  same way I can assure the Member for Telok Blangah\r\n\r\nthat we are not as short-sighted as his friend who  did\r\n\r\nnot  take his good advice. We have already acquired  or\r\n\r\npurchased  properties  in some of  the  capital  cities\r\n\r\nwhere we have missions, used as chancery or residence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the first part of the question, Sir, since\r\n\r\nits  inception in August 1965, the establishment of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Foreign  Affairs has  been  expanding  in\r\n\r\nproportion  with the increasing number of our  overseas\r\n\r\nmissions  to  cope  with  the increased  workload.  The\r\n\r\naccommodation provided in the City Hall became cramped.\r\n\r\nHon.  Members who have visited the Ministry of  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  will  notice  that  most  of  the  staff   are\r\n\r\naccommodated  in  cubicles because of the  shortage  of\r\n\r\noffice space. Besides, the City Hall itself houses  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Law,  Ministry  of  Culture,  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office,  the PUB, and the  Wax  Museum.  So\r\n\r\nthere  is hardly any more room available at the  moment\r\n\r\nto  meet the expansion needs of the Ministry of Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs. However, we have applied for that part of City\r\n\r\nHall  presently occupied by the PUB. This  will  become\r\n\r\navailable only in 1977 when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  PUB  building at Somerset Road is expected  to  be\r\n\r\nready  for  occupation.  In  the  meantime,  additional\r\n\r\noffice  space  had to be acquired by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs  to accommodate the additional  staff,\r\n\r\nand  there  was no alternative but to rent  the  office\r\n\r\nspace in Colombo Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the second part of the question, it is the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy to acquire, whenever possible,  our\r\n\r\nown  buildings and lands for our overseas missions.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,   considerations  of  value  and   prices   are\r\n\r\nimportant in deciding how and when properties are to be\r\n\r\nacquired.  It  is not always possible to  get  suitable\r\n\r\npremises, and, therefore, it has been necessary to rent\r\n\r\nthe  accommodation  required until suitable  properties\r\n\r\nhave been acquired. It is the Ministry's policy to  buy\r\n\r\nproperties   for   overseas  missions   and,   whenever\r\n\r\npossible,  the  accommodations for home-based  officers\r\n\r\nare  also  purchased. But this is dependent on  certain\r\n\r\nrequirements, like price and location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  has  avoided  answering  directly  the   first\r\n\r\nquestion  of the Member for Telok Blangah. The question\r\n\r\nwas: if the Government needed premises, why does it not\r\n\r\nuse  its  own  premises, instead of renting  them  from\r\n\r\nothers? But as a layman who understands the working  of\r\n\r\nthe Government, especially the Finance Ministry, may  I\r\n\r\noffer  an  explanation to satisfy the Member for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah?  I  think the Ministry of Finance  works  from\r\n\r\nthis  angle: if a Ministry can get more financially  in\r\n\r\nreturn  as  a result of whatever arrangement,  then  it\r\n\r\nwill  do  so.  The Finance Ministry probably  found  it\r\n\r\ncould  get more financially in return from renting  its\r\n\r\ncomparable premises to the public than it had to pay to\r\n\r\nColombo  Court for additional premises that the Foreign\r\n\r\nMinistry required. Maybe that is a more relevant answer\r\n\r\nto the Member for Telok Blangah's question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N.

But what I have just pointed out is some  sort\r\n\r\nof  an  illustration of the policy of the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance.

The  Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\ndid  not  answer  my question really.  I  have  got  no\r\n\r\nquarrel  now that the renting of premises in  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  a  temporary measure until such time when  the  PUB\r\n\r\nmoves  out of the present place. The questions I raised\r\n\r\nwere:  (1) why not use one of the Government's premises\r\n\r\navailable? (2) if we are renting them, where  are  they\r\n\r\nlocated, and from whom are we renting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second part about accommodation for overseas\r\n\r\nmissions,  I thought the prudent way was to buy  rather\r\n\r\nthan rent. Money paid for rent goes down the drain.  If\r\n\r\nit  is not possible for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\nto  buy  the  premises outright, could they  not  share\r\n\r\npremises with our State-owned companies abroad, or with\r\n\r\nother statutory boards in certain countries, which have\r\n\r\ntheir own premises or rented premises?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Soo Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Soo Chuan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMember has not been paying attention to my answer  just\r\n\r\nnow.

Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head FA in\r\n\r\nrespect of the Main Estimates be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have moved this amendment in order to bring\r\n\r\nforth  my  own  views regarding some  of  the  policies\r\n\r\nadopted  by the Foreign Affairs Ministry and to suggest\r\n\r\nsome  methods  for  promoting certain  aspects  of  our\r\n\r\nforeign policy. Unfortunately, most of the topics I had\r\n\r\nintended to speak on had already been very well covered\r\n\r\nby  previous  speakers, either  under  the  correct  or\r\n\r\nincorrect Head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would, however, continue by saying that over\r\n\r\nthe  past years the Ministry has conducted its  foreign\r\n\r\npolicy,  to my mind, with a high degree of imagination,\r\n\r\nand this is said not with the intention of praising the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Foreign Affairs or other  Ministers  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  frequently  outspoken  on  affairs  of  our\r\n\r\nforeign   policy.  But  I  am  frequently  amused   and\r\n\r\nbefuddled  with,  on the one hand,  the  expression  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's intention of wanting to remain friends with\r\n\r\nall,  enemies with none and, on the other hand, on many\r\n\r\noccasions,  particularly  at  memorial  lectures,  with\r\n\r\nstatements which leave very little for conclusion. I am\r\n\r\nparticularly troubled because it gives the  lay  public\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  only  one  possible  conclusion  -  that\r\n\r\nsomehow in the 1970's there appears in South-east  Asia\r\n\r\nthe  MaCarthys or Foster Dulles's. This is  unfortunate\r\n\r\nbecause  of  our declared intentions to remain  friends\r\n\r\nwith  all.  This is particularly more annoying  because\r\n\r\ntoday we realise that the real\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthreat  to  Singapore's security and sovereignty  comes\r\n\r\nnot  just  from  the Communist countries  or  Communist\r\n\r\nelements within these countries but it could well  come\r\n\r\nfrom other vested parties. These parties include either\r\n\r\nforces  in  and  around South-east Asia  or  even  some\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the powerful and influential West.  I  can\r\n\r\ntherefore  understand why Singapore does not  pursue  a\r\n\r\npositive  or  dynamic  policy  with  respect   to   the\r\n\r\nrecognition of China because we want to make it  doubly\r\n\r\nsure that our immediate neighbours in this part of  the\r\n\r\nworld  know in heart and in spirit that we are all  the\r\n\r\nway  with  ASEAN and South-east Asia. I think  this  is\r\n\r\ncorrect. On the one hand we are very hesitant,  and  on\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand,  we  tend to overdo  this  particular\r\n\r\nposture  by  coming off with a statement which  may  be\r\n\r\ndetrimental to our future relations with the  countries\r\n\r\nwith which we have no relations at the present moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving from that to other aspects of foreign policy, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to touch on our foreign service. I  realise\r\n\r\nthat  we have something like five High Commissions  and\r\n\r\n10  missions  overseas. Not all of these  missions  are\r\n\r\nheaded  by  Ambassadors or High Commissioners.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthis is because we do not have qualified people. But  I\r\n\r\nlike  to  think that somehow we have not been  able  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  degree of professionalism  in  our  foreign\r\n\r\nservice.  This is something which perhaps the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Foreign  Affairs could comment. I also  understand\r\n\r\nthat  there is a pretty high turnover rate of staff  in\r\n\r\nthe Foreign Ministry. I wonder if the reason is due  to\r\n\r\nthe  unfavourable salary, awards of fringe benefits.  I\r\n\r\nthink  members  of the foreign service rightly  deserve\r\n\r\nsomething better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of ASEAN, the Minister for Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs has given us a very rosy picture of the  status\r\n\r\nof  ASEAN,  and  I certainly hope he is right.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, I have also read some literature on  ASEAN\r\n\r\nand I am informed that, in actual fact, of the original\r\n\r\n100  proposals or more that were conceived in 1967 with\r\n\r\nthe formation of ASEAN, not more than 10 per cent of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  proposals have come to light.

Member:</b> Coming!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Coming? I hope so. I certainly\r\n\r\nhope  that with time we shall be able to see  the  true\r\n\r\nfruition of this big family of ASEAN. I would  like  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  this  topic  a little further.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans had at one time some connection  with  old\r\n\r\nBritannia  and  also  with the English-speaking  world.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  many Singaporeans are extremely  conversant\r\n\r\nwith  what  goes  on in the United States  of  America,\r\n\r\nLondon,  or  up  north  in  Edinburgh,  yet,  the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority of Singaporeans are ignorant of what  goes  on\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia,  in  the  Philippines  or  in  the  Sulu\r\n\r\nIslands.  To my mind, to know about these countries  is\r\n\r\nmore important for the future of Singapore than to know\r\n\r\nabout  what  goes on in the North Sea or in  the  River\r\n\r\nThames. I think there is a lot that this country can do\r\n\r\nto promote the awareness of ASEAN and to foster further\r\n\r\nthe  concept of regionalism. I am most assured  by  the\r\n\r\nstatement  made  by  the Minister for  Foreign  Affairs\r\n\r\nthat, in actual fact, ASEAN is moving faster than  many\r\n\r\nother  regional gatherings. This is tremendous. I  hope\r\n\r\nit  will  continue to move. But, at the same  time,  we\r\n\r\nalso recognise that ASEAN has its own problems. We know\r\n\r\nthat   there  are  differences  between  Malaysia   and\r\n\r\nThailand.  We  know  that of late  there  are  dramatic\r\n\r\ndifferences between the Philippines and Malaysia and, I\r\n\r\nam  sure,  between Malaysia and Indonesia.  Happily  we\r\n\r\nhave no real problems just yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the promotion of travel is a tremendous thing.\r\n\r\nThis  has  been touched upon earlier on.  But  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  is more that can really be done. Student  travel\r\n\r\nshould  be promoted. We have an effective organisation,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  People's Association, which can  sponsor\r\n\r\nyouth groups to visit Indonesia and the Philippines.  I\r\n\r\nam  not  concerned about Malaysia because we  can  just\r\n\r\nleave  the boys alone. They know where to go. They  can\r\n\r\ntake  a  drive  up to the West coast of Malaysia.  They\r\n\r\nnormally stop at Bangkok in Thailand on their way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  Europe or to Hong Kong. However, we must stress the\r\n\r\nimportance  of travel to Indonesia and the Philippines,\r\n\r\ncertainly to Indonesia, which is our immediate concern.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  perhaps as a further step in our  effort  to\r\n\r\npromote ASEAN co-operation, I think there is a case for\r\n\r\nsending   Singapore's   professional   men   to   ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries, and I refer more in particular to our  local\r\n\r\ndoctors  in  the  Singapore service. [Laughter].  I  am\r\n\r\nserious  about this in spite of the laughter.  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  is a case for us to send our doctors for a  six-month  posting or a year's posting to some ulu part  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  We can probably achieve much more  in  this\r\n\r\nway  than some of the airy-fairy ideas that I have come\r\n\r\nacross.

If they want to join, by all means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I think worth considering right\r\n\r\nnow   is  in  regard  to  our  institutions  of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning.  To my knowledge, 25 per cent of the  student\r\n\r\npopulation in Singapore's higher institutions  are,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  non  citizens.  It  is  worth  mentioning   that\r\n\r\nvirtually   the  entire  25  per  cent  are   Malaysian\r\n\r\nstudents.  Figures have been given by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation showing that a sum amounting to about  $4,000\r\n\r\nper  student is subsidised. If we work on the basis  of\r\n\r\n10,000 students in the institutions of higher learning,\r\n\r\nthen   we  have  at  least  2,500  Malaysian  students.\r\n\r\nMultiply  that  number by $4,000 and we have  to  spend\r\n\r\nsomething  like  $10 million a year to train  Malaysian\r\n\r\nstudents  in  Singapore.  I am not  against  Malaysians\r\n\r\nstudying in Singapore. I think we should have  more  of\r\n\r\nthem. It will help us to foster goodwill and strengthen\r\n\r\nour relations with Malaysia. But I think perhaps we can\r\n\r\nthink  of  dividing  the available places  amongst  the\r\n\r\nother  members  of the South-east Asian  community.

So  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to find Out whether it is because Singapore\r\n\r\nis  regarded by the other ASEAN countries  as  being  a\r\n\r\nThird China that we do not want to take the initiative.\r\n\r\nIt  is not only my personal belief that it is so but it\r\n\r\nis  also  the belief from various quarters. So I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he\r\n\r\nis able to confirm this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think the comments by the\r\n\r\nMember for Kim Seng do not require an answer because he\r\n\r\nwas  telling us how he would run the Foreign  Ministry.\r\n\r\nHe  was  not  questioning my foreign policy. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  is very little to answer. Nevertheless  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  say that some of his thoughts would be  taken\r\n\r\nnote  of,  some I would think about, and  some  perhaps\r\n\r\nrequire second thoughts. Anyway, I am grateful  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  putting forward certain points which  have\r\n\r\nbeen illuminating and for saying some indiscreet things\r\n\r\nwhich I would not have said myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member for Bras Basah, probably he was\r\n\r\nnot  here  earlier when one Member did  bring  up  this\r\n\r\nquestion  of  representation and  diplomatic  relations\r\n\r\nwith  the  People's Republic of China.

My\r\n\r\nquestion is: is Singapore still regarded by other ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries as being a Third China that we do not want to\r\n\r\ntake  the  initiative to establish diplomatic relations\r\n\r\nwith Communist China?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think the Member for Bras Basah\r\n\r\nhimself is sophisticated.
