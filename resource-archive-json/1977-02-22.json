Indeed,\r\n\r\nif  they  hold power not only will we be absent  from\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber, we may be in jail or buried  six  feet\r\n\r\nunderground. But neither will the opposition  parties\r\n\r\nexist  except  the stooges. Although they  have  been\r\n\r\ndefeated  and  have  failed to dominate  the  student\r\n\r\norganisations and trade unions so far, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  not  the  type  of people who  despair  quickly.\r\n\r\nRevelations  of the past years amongst  students  and\r\n\r\nalso the revelations of the activities perpetrated by\r\n\r\nG.  Raman  are  proof that their objectives  will  be\r\n\r\npersistently carried out from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday I said that there were opposition\r\n\r\nparties which openly were anti-communist parties, but\r\n\r\nin  the  recent  general elections  these  opposition\r\n\r\nparties   consciously   or  unconsciously   exploited\r\n\r\ncommunist issues in order to catch votes so that they\r\n\r\ncould  get  one or two seats in Parliament.  This  is\r\n\r\ndangerous  if we are not careful and if  we  fail  to\r\n\r\ncomprehend  our  situation, i.e, that  we  face  this\r\n\r\ncommunist  menace.  The  communists  can  feel  proud\r\n\r\nbecause  communist issues were used by the opposition\r\n\r\nparties during the last elections, and that the anti-PAP  votes amounting to 26% could be intended for the\r\n\r\ncommunists; though not all of such votes. Perhaps  it\r\n\r\ncould  be  due to our mistake that there  were  votes\r\n\r\ncast against us at the last elections. In the name of\r\n\r\ndemocracy, I wish to call upon this House and to  the\r\n\r\nopposition  parties  outside  of  this  Chamber   who\r\n\r\nbelieve  in the principles of parliamentary democracy\r\n\r\nnot  to  be  deceived or fall into the  trap  of  the\r\n\r\nclarion call or influence of the communists in  order\r\n\r\nto  gain  one  or  two seats at the  expense  of  the\r\n\r\ninterests of our beloved country. There are signs  in\r\n\r\nthe  forthcoming elections that if the communists are\r\n\r\nunsuccessful  in an attempt to control  this  country\r\n\r\nthrough violence, they would opt one or two political\r\n\r\nparties  to  replace the Barisan Sosialis  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  ostracised by the people, and they  would  then\r\n\r\nuse  these  parties  to oppose  the  party  that  has\r\n\r\ncomplete faith in parliamentary democracy, especially\r\n\r\nour    party.   We   Members   of   Parliament    are\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people and we are expected  to\r\n\r\nexpress  the  wishes of the people. Because  we  come\r\n\r\nfrom the same party, the voice in this Chamber can be\r\n\r\nregarded as self-correction for the purpose of taking\r\n\r\nremedial  measures. For almost 18 years that  I  have\r\n\r\nserved in this Chamber I had no opportunity to  speak\r\n\r\nas  a  Member of Parliament. Perhaps. Mr Speaker too,\r\n\r\nsince his election to this House, could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  make  representation on the aspirations  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  he represents. But now I have the opportunity\r\n\r\ntoday to say a few words, not as a Minister of State,\r\n\r\nbut  as  a  Member  of  Parliament  representing  the\r\n\r\nKampong  Ubi  constituency.  Hopefully,  perhaps   my\r\n\r\nlittle  contribution  will  not  offend  some  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues,    neither    will    it    create    any\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  at all. We know that  there  is  no\r\n\r\ngovernment in this world that can offer everything to\r\n\r\neveryone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not repeat what has been said by Members\r\n\r\nover  the  last few days, but I wish to add bits  and\r\n\r\npieces.  For  the  past few years we  have  tried  to\r\n\r\nevolve a Singapore society, rugged, self-reliant  and\r\n\r\ndisciplined. These principles have been the theme  of\r\n\r\nour  message  to all the people in the Republic.  But\r\n\r\nfrom  day  to  day  we  seem to hear  less  of  these\r\n\r\nslogans. What we see, of late, is not a rugged, self-disciplined society as we are hoping for,  but  moral\r\n\r\ndecadence among our youths. They imitate the  western\r\n\r\nhippies.  They  take to drugs. We  realise  that  our\r\n\r\nsmall country, without any natural resources, depends\r\n\r\nsolely on our human resources for our development. We\r\n\r\ndepend on our youth because youth is the backbone  of\r\n\r\nany  national  development. I do not know  where  the\r\n\r\nfault lies. Is it because our life depends solely  on\r\n\r\nmaterialism  or  that  the  implementation   of   our\r\n\r\neducation  policy  has deviated to  the  extent  that\r\n\r\nstudents  show  no  respect for  teachers  while  the\r\n\r\nchildren  show  no respect for their  parents?  Where\r\n\r\ndoes  the  fault lie? There is the theory  that  drug\r\n\r\naddiction  is  the  result  of  activities  of  anti-national  elements, especially the  communists  whose\r\n\r\naim  is to destroy our youth by the use of drugs  and\r\n\r\nhippism  so  that in the long term our youth  has  no\r\n\r\nfuture.  It would then be easy for the communists  to\r\n\r\ninfluence  them  and they can then  easily  rule  our\r\n\r\ncountry. I hope the Ministry concerned will go deeply\r\n\r\ninto   this  theory  because  moral  decadence, drug\r\n\r\naddiction, etc, do not affect those students who  are\r\n\r\nless  educated.  Many  youths who  are  in  secondary\r\n\r\nschool and who have completed secondary education are\r\n\r\ndrug  addicts. This is very strange.  So  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter which we must look into. We hope to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuild a rugged society, self-reliant and disciplined,\r\n\r\nbut  unfortunately today the reverse has taken place.\r\n\r\nWe  will  be questioned later on. At a time  when  we\r\n\r\nhold power and the world acknowledges our progress in\r\n\r\nthe  fields  of  economy  and  nation  building, our\r\n\r\ngrandchildren will condemn us, \"How is it that during\r\n\r\nyour  period  of  rule the moral of our  grandfathers\r\n\r\nregressed? Their lives were destroyed with the result\r\n\r\nthat   we,  the  grandchildren, are  in  a   similar\r\n\r\nposition.\"  To  avoid such accusation.  I  hope  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers of the House will ponder together. We  should\r\n\r\nthink  deeply  into  this with a view  to  finding  a\r\n\r\nsolution.  We  realise  that we  should  educate  our\r\n\r\nchildren  in line with the principle that our  youths\r\n\r\nshould  be  educated. Give our children an  education\r\n\r\ndifferent  from that which we have obtained,  because\r\n\r\nthey  were born for their era, not ours, and  because\r\n\r\ntheir  era is different from that of ours. But if  we\r\n\r\nbequeath to our children moral decadence or  if  they\r\n\r\nare  influenced by anti-national elements,  it  would\r\n\r\nindeed  be  a  great pity to see our success  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  fields of nation building destroyed by  them\r\n\r\nin  a  very short time, all because the basic  values\r\n\r\nfor  their future had not been sound enough.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  relevant Ministry sets up a commission  of\r\n\r\ninquiry into the causes of moral decadence among  our\r\n\r\nyouth,  and to make recommendations on the  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  of  overcoming  these problems.  There  is  no\r\n\r\ndifference  between  the  communist  menace  and  the\r\n\r\ndangers  of moral decadence among our youth. If  drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers, pro-communists and others, whose country\r\n\r\nof  origin  is  outside of Singapore but subsequently\r\n\r\nobtained Singapore citizenship, are found and  proven\r\n\r\nguilty  of  such  perpetrations then  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  automatically cancel their  citizenships  and\r\n\r\ndrive  them  away  from  this  country  There  is  no\r\n\r\nMinistry  yet to really focus attention to  lead  our\r\n\r\nyouths  on  the  correct path If we cannot  create  a\r\n\r\nspecial department for the youth, a youth and  sports\r\n\r\nbureau should be set up to look after their problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Kampong Ubi, I share the views\r\n\r\nexpressed by hon. Members in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  since the debate began. For instance, although\r\n\r\nthis  is a small matter but as a Member of Parliament\r\n\r\nwho  holds \"Meet-the-People\" sessions, there are many\r\n\r\nmatters  which are brought to my knowledge and  which\r\n\r\nneed the assistance of a Member of Parliament. One is\r\n\r\nthe  matter  of  Government officers passing  on  the\r\n\r\nbuck.  If the people want houses, \"Go to the MP\".  If\r\n\r\nthey  want licences, \"Go to the MP.\" Incidentally,  I\r\n\r\nhappen  to  be  a  Minister of State,  better  still,\r\n\r\n\"Approach  the Minister of State.\" We emphasise  that\r\n\r\nin  the  present,  Government there is  no  political\r\n\r\nnepotism.  So  we  must inform  these  officers  that\r\n\r\ndisciplinary  action may be taken  if  they  are  not\r\n\r\ncareful. Likewise, with regard to payments, here  and\r\n\r\nthere  people  are  complaining about  payments.  Why\r\n\r\nextra  payments for this month? Why merely in respect\r\n\r\nof  PUB  charges? If the people write back to appeal,\r\n\r\nthe  answer is, \"Pay up first and complain later.\"  I\r\n\r\nremember  that  when I was a member of  the  People's\r\n\r\nDefence  Force my superior ordered me to do something\r\n\r\nand  I  was not supposed to object. \"Do it first  and\r\n\r\ncomplain later \" This is what is happening now. If we\r\n\r\npay  up first, we will have to wait for three or four\r\n\r\nmonths  before  we  can get a  refund,  This  is  the\r\n\r\nproblem,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  raise  this  problem\r\n\r\nbecause   in  my  constituency,  which  is   a   poor\r\n\r\nconstituency, a person earning $200 per month has  to\r\n\r\nbudget  for food, and this and that. If they have  to\r\n\r\npay  excessive amounts on monthly bills,  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible for them to draw up a budget. They  will  be\r\n\r\nforced to borrow or to pawn their belongings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem in Kampong Ubi concerns\r\n\r\nresettlement.  I  do  not object to  resettlement  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  question  of  resettlement  has  been   a\r\n\r\npolitical issue since 1972. When I returned from  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines  the then Minister for Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  notified that Alsagoff estate  would  be\r\n\r\nacquired.  The  people agreed to the acquisition  and\r\n\r\nresettlement  for the purpose of redevelopment.  Then\r\n\r\n1973 passed on until today. What I regret most is the\r\n\r\nmodus  operand,'  of resettlement.  In  the  kampongs\r\n\r\nsometimes only a portion of it is cleared; five\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfamilies  would be resettled in the north, seven  or\r\n\r\neight families in the south, 10 families in the east,\r\n\r\nand  six families in the centre. The houses of  those\r\n\r\nfamilies who had left were not looked after.  In  the\r\n\r\nend, the  remaining families are scattered here  and\r\n\r\nthere.  They  suffered for more than two  years  They\r\n\r\nsent   appeals  to  the  Urban  and  Rural   Services\r\n\r\nCommittee to have the drains repaired, and the  reply\r\n\r\nwas that the houses would be affected by resettlement\r\n\r\nbut  they  took two years to move them out. A  doctor\r\n\r\nknows which particular disease requires an operation,\r\n\r\nbut  before he operates on his patients he  would  at\r\n\r\nleast prescribe Panadol to relieve the pain. However,\r\n\r\nnot  a  single action was taken This happened  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency of Kampong Ubi. So there was an  absence\r\n\r\nof   fair   play.  The  clearance  was  carried   out\r\n\r\nhaphazardly.  The people were told to keep  the  area\r\n\r\nclean  but mosquitoes were found breeding in stagnant\r\n\r\nwater  in  the  area. As a Member  of  Parliament.  I\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the  Minister concerned to  take  action.\r\n\r\nClearance should be taken in an orderly fashion, say.\r\n\r\nstart  with Jalan Labu, and not clear five houses  in\r\n\r\nJalan  Labu  and  then another five houses  in  Jalan\r\n\r\nKachang.  This  is  not fair to the families  because\r\n\r\nempty  houses  become the centre for drug  addiction.\r\n\r\nThis was the case in a recent fire which occurred  in\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai, where an empty house was found to have\r\n\r\nbeen used as a drug den. This is the after-effect  of\r\n\r\nresettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of resettlement is that the officers\r\n\r\nare  not  trained  in  their  work.,  They  give   an\r\n\r\nassurance  to  the people that they will  be  offered\r\n\r\nalternative  accommodation, but when the  time  comes\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  accommodation \"The  houses  have  been\r\n\r\noccupied.\" When asked for a reason, they were told to\r\n\r\nsee  the  MP. The MP says that, \"The flats have  been\r\n\r\noccupied,  and  therefore, the resettlement  officers\r\n\r\nshould  not  make promises.\" All that I have  related\r\n\r\nactually happened in Kampong Ubi. I have not  touched\r\n\r\nupon the problems in other constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which bedevils the people is\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  We are aware that in certain  countries\r\n\r\nthe granting of citizenship is tightly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrolled.  I  agree with this policy.  But  what  I\r\n\r\nregret  is  that  because of  the  fault  of  certain\r\n\r\nparents their children who were born in Singapore had\r\n\r\ntheir  names  misreported at the  police  station  in\r\n\r\nthose days. At that time police officers passed  only\r\n\r\nStandard II or III. For example, the name of  \"Chang\"\r\n\r\nwas  changed  to \"Chong\"; \"Mohammed\" was  changed  to\r\n\r\n\"Ahmad\",  and mis-spellings occurred. There are  also\r\n\r\npeople  who  were  born  in  Singapore  but  are  now\r\n\r\nstateless.  They  have no country of  origin.  Is  it\r\n\r\nright  that  the  children  should  be  punished   by\r\n\r\nbecoming  stateless because of the fault  or  sin  of\r\n\r\ntheir  parents? This problem, Mr Speaker, Sir, should\r\n\r\nbe given due and weighty consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Malaysia but I came to Singapore. I\r\n\r\nbecame a Singapore citizen and I can enjoy the rights\r\n\r\nof  a citizen of Singapore. In fact, I am a Member of\r\n\r\nParliament.  Why is it that those who  were  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, but because of the fault of their parents,\r\n\r\nhave  become stateless? I have harped on this  matter\r\n\r\nin  this House many a time because this issue, on the\r\n\r\nbasis  of humanitarian consideration, should be given\r\n\r\nweighty consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not concerned about those who were born\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore I am concerned merely with  people\r\n\r\nwho  were born in Singapore. Nevertheless, those  who\r\n\r\nwere  born  outside Singapore should  also  be  given\r\n\r\nconsideration. In the spirit of ASEAN we should  act.\r\n\r\nso   that  our  citizens  who  were  born  in   ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries,  for  instance, if 100  of  them  obtained\r\n\r\ncitizenship we should reciprocate on a mutual  basis.\r\n\r\nSometimes  in a family you find that the  wife  is  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean and the husband a non-Singaporean, or the\r\n\r\nwife  is  a  foreigner and the husband a Singaporean.\r\n\r\nThis  situation is commonly found for many years now.\r\n\r\nBefore  the  introduction of family planning  such  a\r\n\r\nfamily  may have 10 children and yet they are without\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship. In the  spirit  of  ASEAN  we\r\n\r\nshould  discuss this aspect passionately. We  do  not\r\n\r\nwish  other citizens to become our citizens. I  think\r\n\r\nthis is not quite just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the points that are constantly brought up\r\n\r\nby  my  constituents who see me during  my  meet-the-people sessions. As the Member for Kampong Ubi,  they\r\n\r\nput  these  grievances to me and, as I said  earlier.\r\n\r\nthe  most  important question is our youth.  We  hope\r\n\r\nthat   the  Ministry  concerned  will  take  positive\r\n\r\nmeasures  so  that  we will not  be  branded  by  our\r\n\r\ngrandchildren  later on. We cannot be  proud  of  our\r\n\r\ndevelopments, successes and achievements so  long  as\r\n\r\nour children suffer from moral decadence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the Motion moved by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, since the President made his policy\r\n\r\nspeech in this House, many Members have spoken in the\r\n\r\ndebate  giving  their criticisms or  views,  many  of\r\n\r\nwhich  seemed quite all right, moderate or objective.\r\n\r\nThey  merit  the  attention of  this  House  and  the\r\n\r\nattention  of the Ministries concerned. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand, certain criticisms do not seem practical;  they\r\n\r\neven  run  counter to the policies and principles  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government. Therefore, it behoves the Ministries\r\n\r\nconcerned  to  reply,  explain  or  to  correct  such\r\n\r\ncriticisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe hon. Members will agree with my\r\n\r\nviews,  that in the present living environment  there\r\n\r\nare  many matters which are easier to talk about than\r\n\r\nto  act,  not  to speak of the complex  entity  of  a\r\n\r\nsociety  consisting  of a very complicated  structure\r\n\r\nmade up of diverse factors. If we emphasise only  one\r\n\r\naspect  of  something it may lead to the  neglect  of\r\n\r\nother  aspects.  So only a balanced  development  can\r\n\r\nhelp maintain a balanced progress of a society. There\r\n\r\nis  a Chinese saying to illustrate this point \"Though\r\n\r\nthe  peony flower is beautiful, it needs green leaves\r\n\r\nto  contrast  and  bring out its  beauty.\"  Moreover,\r\n\r\nbefore  the  plant can grow luxuriantly the  gardener\r\n\r\nhas to take a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlong time and much effort to fertilise, water and  to\r\n\r\ncultivate  the plant before it can come  into  bloom.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  we just look at things  superficially\r\n\r\nwithout  a  deeper  understanding  and  make  certain\r\n\r\nassertions  about  them, that  may  not  be  correct.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like to correct certain criticisms\r\n\r\nlevelled  at  the  Environment  Ministry  by  certain\r\n\r\nMembers.  At the same time, I will go a step  further\r\n\r\nto explain the objects and the work of my Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all. I will reply to the two points\r\n\r\nof  criticism  made  by the Member  for  Changi.  The\r\n\r\nMember  expressed his dissatisfaction  about  certain\r\n\r\nhawker  inspectors of the Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nfor  having  taken action against certain  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers.  I  would  like to ask  him:  if  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers  are  allowed  the same  rights  as  licensed\r\n\r\nhawkers,  then  what is the point of  the  Government\r\n\r\nissuing licences to the hawkers? What then is the use\r\n\r\nof setting up markets and food centres? Between these\r\n\r\ntwo   categories  of  hawkers  there  must  be   some\r\n\r\ndistinction  made before the Ministry  concerned  can\r\n\r\nknow  how  to  exercise  control.  Furthermore,  this\r\n\r\nmatter  is  closely linked with the question  of  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of public hygiene and cleanliness and the\r\n\r\npreservation of the purity of water supply to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no pollution. How are  you  going  to\r\n\r\nexercise these functions without proper control? Sir.\r\n\r\nbefore  us  is a realistic question, do  we  want  an\r\n\r\norderly  society  or  a loosely  knit,  undisciplined\r\n\r\nhomestead?  As a responsible Government  we  have  to\r\n\r\nmaintain law, order and peace for the people, and not\r\n\r\njust  to curry favour with them. In so doing  we  may\r\n\r\noffend  some  people, but because  of  our  duty  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility we have to try our best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of hawkers had been dealt with between\r\n\r\n1966  and  1973,  that is a period  of  seven  years,\r\n\r\nduring which there was a nation-wide registration  of\r\n\r\nhawkers  and  issuing licences to them.  At  present.\r\n\r\nthere  are  altogether some 28,700 hawkers.  Compared\r\n\r\nwith  the  present  population of  our  country,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of hawkers is quite sufficient. In the Adendum\r\n\r\nto  the  President's speech this point has also  been\r\n\r\nclearly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstated. On the other hand, I am sure Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse  may  not want to see a resurgence of  the  old\r\n\r\nsituation  some  ten years ago where the  roads,  car\r\n\r\nparks  and  public  places were  all  congested  with\r\n\r\nhawkers, At that time unemployment was at its height.\r\n\r\nBut today the situation is entirely different. We are\r\n\r\nfaced  with  a  shortage of labour. We had  to  issue\r\n\r\nthousands of work permits to allow foreigners to come\r\n\r\nhere  to work. So the question we are facing  now  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  lack of jobs but the manpower. Under  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances, I believe the Members will, of course,\r\n\r\nbe very clear about what to do and what to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has made another criticism.\r\n\r\nHe  criticised that the hawker inspectors  have  been\r\n\r\ntaking    action    only   in    the    Backbenchers'\r\n\r\nconstituencies    and   not   in    the    Ministers'\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  This is again even  more  incorrect.\r\n\r\nLet  me  quote  some figures to the  Member  for  his\r\n\r\nreference.  Since September 1976 until  recently,  in\r\n\r\nthe  Changi constituency there were only seven  cases\r\n\r\nof   summons  against  hawkers.  In  the  Kreta  Ayer\r\n\r\nconstituency there were 52 summonses issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on\r\n\r\na  point  of clarification. The comparison  does  not\r\n\r\nseem to be quite correct, because in Changi there are\r\n\r\nvery  few  hawkers whereas in Kreta Ayer constituency\r\n\r\nthere  are  so  many. Therefore, the use  of  such  a\r\n\r\ncomparison  is not quite appropriate. It  would  seem\r\n\r\nthat   the  Senior  Parliamentary  Secretary   stands\r\n\r\nsuspect of misleading the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I believe the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kampong Chai Chee has forgotten  another\r\n\r\npoint. Changi is a much bigger area, perhaps 10 to 20\r\n\r\ntimes  bigger than Kreta Ayer. In view of  this,  the\r\n\r\ndifference  in the number of hawkers may  not  be  so\r\n\r\ngreat. Maybe we have got to wait for another day when\r\n\r\na  proper survey can be made of the number of hawkers\r\n\r\nin these two constituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Kreta Ayer constituency there were 52\r\n\r\nsummonses issued. In the Rochore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nconstituency  there were 59 cases where hawkers  were\r\n\r\nissued  with summonses. At the same time, I  have  to\r\n\r\nreiterate   that  in  1967  when  the   exercise   of\r\n\r\nadjustment  of hawkers and the issue of licences  was\r\n\r\nundertaken,  the  first  constituency  to  have  such\r\n\r\naction   taken  was  Geylang  West  which   was   the\r\n\r\nconstituency of the Minister who was in charge of the\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department  then.  The  second  constituency\r\n\r\nwhere  the operation was done was Tanjong Pagar,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's constituency. From these  facts  we\r\n\r\ncan  say  that  we do not make any discrimination  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk about certain questions raised by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Whampoa. He said that we should\r\n\r\nallocate more hawker stalls to those who are old,\r\n\r\npoor, destitute or those hardship cases. In fact,\r\n\r\nthe Government has paid attention to this point for\r\n\r\nmany years. But from our experience this is not a\r\n\r\ngood way to help. I would like to say further that\r\n\r\nthe allocation of stalls has been done after a\r\n\r\nthorough planning and consideration. The truth is\r\n\r\nthat only with proper planning and operation can\r\n\r\nthey make a profit. It is not just a matter of\r\n\r\nbeing allocated a stall and you can then make\r\n\r\nmoney. More important is that if you allot a large\r\n\r\nnumber of stalls to the old or destitute at the\r\n\r\nsame place where the stall-holders lack experience,\r\n\r\nthen it will be of no help to them. Perhaps they\r\n\r\nmight be responsible for the poor business of that\r\n\r\nhawker centre, and thus they would land themselves\r\n\r\nin greater difficulty. The Member also wants to\r\n\r\nknow about the conditions for the allocation of 5%\r\n\r\nof licences to hardship cases, This is not easy to\r\n\r\nenumerate. I can only tell him briefly that -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\non a point of clarification. The Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary referred to the criteria\r\n\r\nfor the allocation of stalls to old people. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, my point was that these are people\r\n\r\nwith no other means of livelihood, Although they\r\n\r\nmay have had no previous experience in hawking they\r\n\r\nstill want to give it a try. So why cannot they be\r\n\r\ngiven a hawker stall? I have in front of me a\r\n\r\nletter written by the Hawkers Department to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na hawker's application for a stall. If I may read out\r\n\r\nthe criteria listed here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I refer to your request ... [etc].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to inform you that this Department has ceased\r\n\r\nissuing  new  hawker licences. However, consideration\r\n\r\nwit  be  given to applicants if they could ,  produce\r\n\r\ndocumentary proof:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that they have citizen/permanent resident\r\n\r\ndependants to support;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that they are unable to get alternative\r\n\r\nemployment  on  justifiable  grounds:  for   example.\r\n\r\nphysical disability:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) that they are in financial hardship: and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) that they are 40 years old and above.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this means that if an old man does not have any\r\n\r\nchildren  to support, he is, therefore, not eligible.\r\n\r\nOr if old people are deserted by their children - the\r\n\r\nchildren  may be earning a lot of money but they  are\r\n\r\nnot  filial and do not give a cent to the old parents\r\n\r\nwho  are then left high and dry, stranded without any\r\n\r\nmeans  of  financial  support,  again  they  are  not\r\n\r\neligible.  So what do you do about such  old  people?\r\n\r\nAccording to the four criteria listed, I do not think\r\n\r\nanybody can qualify at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now the\r\n\r\nMember  for Whampoa spelt out the criteria.

Now let  me\r\n\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\nConcerning the definition or conditions on the issue\r\n\r\nof licences to the 5% hardship cases -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nhas not replied to my question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, allow me to\r\n\r\ncontinue.  He  has a lot of opportunity  to  air  his\r\n\r\nviews. Sir, other than what has been said about  such\r\n\r\npeople being poor, destitute, old, or in hardship, as\r\n\r\nthe Member has said, there is another situation which\r\n\r\nwill also have to be considered. That is when someone\r\n\r\nwho  is affected by Government's clearance scheme  is\r\n\r\nrequired  to be resettled and would thereby lose  his\r\n\r\nmeans of livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the other criticism is about the raising of\r\n\r\nhawkers' fees which might lead to an increase in\r\n\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Point of clarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not wish to\r\n\r\ngive way, Sir. He will have a lot of time and\r\n\r\nopportunity to air his views. On this point we have\r\n\r\nmade a careful consideration. In fact, the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not trying to increase hawker fees. In\r\n\r\nfact, it is only a matter of reducing the subsidy\r\n\r\ngiven because the subsidy to every hawker stall has\r\n\r\nbeen quite substantial and has to be reduced\r\n\r\ngradually from now. In fact, the present rate is\r\n\r\nstill far less than what is being charged by the\r\n\r\nprivate hawker stalls, such as in private eating\r\n\r\nhouses or coffee shops. It is about one-half or one-third of the fees charged by the private hawker\r\n\r\nstall proprietors. Whatever it is, when adjusting\r\n\r\nthe fees to be charged, Members will be given an\r\n\r\nopportunity to discuss and debate the matter. When\r\n\r\nthe time comes, if the Member for Whampoa can extend\r\n\r\nhis vision further to understand the real situation\r\n\r\nwithout looking through his own blurred glasses -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.\r\n\r\nSir, before the fees are raised, we should be given\r\n\r\nan opportunity to discuss, and not after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That was what he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng:</b> I will come to the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) Sir, if he can see further, he will\r\n\r\nrealise   that  the  hawkers  do  not  constitute   a\r\n\r\nsignificant  number  in  the business  population  to\r\n\r\ninfluence  the prices of commodities. The Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang appears to be putting on the same shoes  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Whampoa on this matter.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturers/distributors,   importers   and    more\r\n\r\nimportant   the   production   countries   that   are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the  high  increase  in  prices  of\r\n\r\ncommodities  and  inflation.  Anyway, when  we  make\r\n\r\nadjustments to hawkers' fees, then hon. Members  will\r\n\r\nhave an opportunity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto discuss or debate about this matter before we come\r\n\r\nto any conclusion or decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by the Member is that the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not abolish pasar ma/am which is  a\r\n\r\ncharacteristic feature of nightlife in Singapore.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  are  many  features  of  nightlife   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  not just pasar ma/am alone.  In  addition\r\n\r\nthis  is a matter that affects the Government's long-term  planning.  The decisive factor  as  to  whether\r\n\r\npasar  malam  should be retained depends  on  several\r\n\r\nfactors,  such  as whether the pasar ma/am  is  in  a\r\n\r\nresidential  area, or along a main  thoroughfare,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  they  will cause complaints of inconvenience\r\n\r\nto  the residents, such as complaints of interference\r\n\r\nwith   traffic,  noise  and  pollution, which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot just disregard. In such cases,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will have to consider the reallocation  of\r\n\r\nsites  for  pasar  ma/am hawkers to  enable  them  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  their old trade of making  a  living.\r\n\r\nSuch new sites may be in a market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point mentioned is that street hawkers\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  moved into a market or  food  centre\r\n\r\nwhere  business is poor. This suggestion runs counter\r\n\r\nto  the  Government's  policy and  principle  and  is\r\n\r\ntherefore difficult to accept. The main intention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government in the setting up of markets and food\r\n\r\ncentres  is to raise the standard of hygiene  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide better services to the residents. Whether  or\r\n\r\nnot the removal of open-air street hawkers from their\r\n\r\nshabby pitches to well constructed food centres  with\r\n\r\nbetter   facilities  will  lead  to  better  business\r\n\r\nactually depends on the individual hawker rather than\r\n\r\nthe  location. For instance, if the operator  is  not\r\n\r\n\"positive\"  or a person without drive  and  his  food\r\n\r\ndoes  not  suit his customers, then even  though  the\r\n\r\nlocality  is good, he may not get any good  business.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, if he can provide cheap and  good\r\n\r\nfood  and his services meet with the requirements  of\r\n\r\nhis  customers,  then  even if  his  stall  is  at  a\r\n\r\nsomewhat  lonely place, many customers will still  go\r\n\r\nto his stall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the choice of locality for setting up\r\n\r\nnew  markets  and food centres and the  provision  of\r\n\r\nancillary amenities, we have all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalong  been dealing with such matters very carefully.\r\n\r\nWe  have  always considered the need for  a  suitable\r\n\r\nlocality  for  the convenience of the  residents  and\r\n\r\ncustomers.  Generally, they are centrally placed  and\r\n\r\nwe  would also provide supplementary facilities  such\r\n\r\nas car parks, tables and chairs, sufficient space and\r\n\r\nother basic facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally speaking, in this age of progress\r\n\r\nthere  will  be produced two kinds of situations.  In\r\n\r\none situation, the people can change and adapt to the\r\n\r\nnew environment, where they will be quite comfortable\r\n\r\nand  march forward together with the progress. On the\r\n\r\nother hand, there will be those who cannot understand\r\n\r\nand  hesitate; they do not adapt to the new situation\r\n\r\nand  cannot face the challenge. So they become \"drop-outs.\"  I  have  full sympathy with such  unfortunate\r\n\r\npeople. At the same time, I hope they will strive  to\r\n\r\ncatch up with time and compete with the situation for\r\n\r\ntheir  own good. I would like to appeal to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Whampoa  who  is  a learned  and  well  informed\r\n\r\neconomist and must be quite well versed with economic\r\n\r\nmatters  and the vicissitudes of economic situations.\r\n\r\nHe  should be able to show the people what to do  and\r\n\r\nwhere to go. Therefore, I hope he can point out a way\r\n\r\nto  such  \"drop-outs\" to look for a new economic  way\r\n\r\nout for them - of course, not to become hawkers alone\r\n\r\n- so as to provide new opportunities for them to make\r\n\r\na living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I would like to thank the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson for reminding me that we should  pay  more\r\n\r\nattention to penalising those hawker licence  holders\r\n\r\nwho  do not operate the stalls but sub-letting  their\r\n\r\nlicence  to  other hawkers for profit.  I  thank  the\r\n\r\nMember for such concern over the malpractice of  sub-letting  hawker licences, and we shall pay  attention\r\n\r\nto him as we have always done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after replying to all these questions. I would\r\n\r\nalso like to avail myself of this opportunity to talk\r\n\r\nabout   the   situation  of  our  Ministry   of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment   staff  to  enlighten   Members.   These\r\n\r\nuniformed  field  officers, in the  course  of  their\r\n\r\nduty,  are often faced with a difficult and dangerous\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes they have to carry out their duty  late  at\r\n\r\nnight.  Last month, there was a case where a  thunder\r\n\r\nflash was thrown at a few staff of our Ministry  when\r\n\r\nthey  were carrying out their duty in the early hours\r\n\r\nof the morning. Fortunately, nobody was injured. They\r\n\r\nwere then dealing with a few cases of illegal foreign\r\n\r\nhawkers. If I do not explain this situation,  Members\r\n\r\nmay not quite understand. I have said earlier that  a\r\n\r\nsociety  consists  of various units which  interlink.\r\n\r\nSo, in such diverse units, certain members of society\r\n\r\noccupy  jobs which are better than the others.  There\r\n\r\nare still others who carry out certain jobs which are\r\n\r\nless  desired.  Perhaps,  we  can  say  that  it   is\r\n\r\nindividual  luck, just as what is said in  the  Three\r\n\r\nKingdoms.   The  strategist  Kun  Ming   said:   \"Man\r\n\r\nproposes.  God disposes.\" So, there must be  somebody\r\n\r\noccupying  some place in the society.  Such  are  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  and onerous tasks faced by  the  hawker\r\n\r\ninspectors.  They  are also part and  parcel  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizenry.  In the course of their heavy duty,  there\r\n\r\nmay  be  certain faults or shortcomings.  Very  often\r\n\r\nthese  faults are quickly seized upon and criticised.\r\n\r\nHowever,  seldom  do we hear of any praises  for  any\r\n\r\ngood  work  done  by them in difficult circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not  fair to them. Therefore, lately,  this\r\n\r\nwork of uniformed officers is a job not liked by  the\r\n\r\nyoung  members of our society. For the  same  reason,\r\n\r\nthere are people who are already in this kind of  job\r\n\r\nin  the  Government  service and they  also  want  to\r\n\r\nleave. I am not trying to argue for them or to defend\r\n\r\nthem.  What I am saying is that there should be  some\r\n\r\nclearcut line drawn between what is right and  to  be\r\n\r\nrewarded  and  what is wrong and to be  punished.  My\r\n\r\ncontention  is that if any of them has committed  any\r\n\r\nserious  and  inexcusable error, then  he  should  be\r\n\r\nseverely punished. On the other hand, if any of  them\r\n\r\nhas  not  committed  any error  but  has  accumulated\r\n\r\nmerits for diligent and faithful work, then we should\r\n\r\nby  word  or  deed  give  them some  commendation  or\r\n\r\nencouragement. Seriously speaking, if we are short of\r\n\r\nsuch loyal and faithful uniformed personnel, then  it\r\n\r\nwill be worse for the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  and  they  cannot  enjoy  a  life  as\r\n\r\ncomfortable as the one they have now, So, in view  of\r\n\r\nthis,  we  should not single them out and  cavil  too\r\n\r\nmuch  about their faults and shortcomings. I  believe\r\n\r\nthat Members of this House will share my views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, a point of clarification. Let\r\n\r\nme hasten to add that the Hawkers Department has done\r\n\r\na very good job indeed in re-locating the majority of\r\n\r\nhawkers in good hawker centres. My point is that I am\r\n\r\nnot  against  the  re-location policy  as  such,  but\r\n\r\nsimply  requiring hawkers, already in good  locations\r\n\r\nbut  on the streets, to move into those hawker stalls\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been vacant for a long time because  the\r\n\r\nsites of those stalls are not good for business. I do\r\n\r\nrecognise that there is a personal element involved - that  some people are just no good at doing business.\r\n\r\nBut  we  are  talking about hawkers who  are  holding\r\n\r\ntemporary  licences and who are doing well  in  their\r\n\r\npresent location.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, in our resettlement policies in general,\r\n\r\nnot too much attention has been given to the loss  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  incurred by the people who  are  forced  to\r\n\r\nresettle in the process, whether they are shopkeepers\r\n\r\nor  hawkers.  I  have no quarrels  with  the  general\r\n\r\npolicy  of requiring our young people to go  out  and\r\n\r\nwork to learn a skill and so on rather than taking up\r\n\r\nhawking.  But at the same time let us be  mindful  of\r\n\r\npeople  who  are old and who are widows,  who  either\r\n\r\nhave  no  alternative means of livelihood or  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  a  widow,  which the  Senior  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  chose to ignore altogether,  is  really  a\r\n\r\nvery  pathetic  one, Sir, As I said earlier  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  she may be below 40 years or above 40  years,\r\n\r\nand  if she has three or four children to support and\r\n\r\nif  she only qualifies for a $200\" a month job  as  a\r\n\r\nsweeper or cleaner, how can she possibly support  the\r\n\r\nchildren? At the same time if she has to go  out  and\r\n\r\nwork,  she cannot bring the children along with them.\r\n\r\nSo  she has to rely upon a baby sitter. But if she is\r\n\r\ngiven  a  hawker  stall, she at least  can  have  the\r\n\r\nyounger children with her and that will save her  the\r\n\r\nadditional  expense of a baby sitter.

Our continued well being depends  on\r\n\r\nour  ability  to attract foreign investments  and  to\r\n\r\nsell  our goods and services abroad. We were able  to\r\n\r\ndo  this in the late 60's and early 70's aided  by  a\r\n\r\nfavourable  international economic  situation.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult we achieved double digit economic growth rates\r\n\r\nand  enjoyed  the benefits of successful development.\r\n\r\nJobs  were created. Wage increases were announced  by\r\n\r\nthe National Wages Council.\r\n\r\nThere   were  increases  and  improvement  in  social\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the international economic environment has\r\n\r\ngrown  difficult. With the more than  quadrupling  of\r\n\r\noil  prices  and  fear of inflation,  the  industrial\r\n\r\nnations  of  the West have aimed for a modest  growth\r\n\r\nrate  of  5% per annum till the end of the 70's.  The\r\n\r\nunemployment rates in these countries are expected to\r\n\r\nremain  high.  In  1976, the world economic  recovery\r\n\r\nslowed  down.  Though the US, Japan and West  Germany\r\n\r\nhave  announced  their intention to  stimulate  their\r\n\r\neconomies,  the international economic situation  for\r\n\r\n1977 remains uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OECD countries are our main sources of investments.\r\n\r\nThey  are also our important trading partners.  Given\r\n\r\nthe economic problems in these countries, investments\r\n\r\nwill  be  difficult to come by. Furthermore, we  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  face competition for investments  from  our\r\n\r\ncompetitors   like  South  Korea  and   Taiwan.   Our\r\n\r\ncompetitors will also be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarketing  products and services in competition  with\r\n\r\nus in these and other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given increased difficulties in getting foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments and increased market competition and  the\r\n\r\nneed  to find jobs for the 26,300 school leavers  who\r\n\r\nwill be entering the labour market each year for  the\r\n\r\nnext  few years, policies to maximise our ability  to\r\n\r\npersuade  local  and  foreign  capital  to   set   up\r\n\r\nfactories  here and for overseas markets to  buy  our\r\n\r\ngoods  and  services are called for. Where labour  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it  is in their long term  interest  that\r\n\r\nunions  help to maintain industrial peace and  pursue\r\n\r\nrealistic wage and fringe benefits demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across-the-board wage increases and increases in\r\n\r\nthe range and quantum of fringe benefits would not be\r\n\r\npossible  in  the  immediate period ahead.  Wage  and\r\n\r\nother   increases   have  to  be   tied   to   higher\r\n\r\nproductivity.  It  is a tribute to  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nleadership  that it has moved in this  direction.  In\r\n\r\nthe 1975/76 National Wages Council session, the union\r\n\r\nleadership  has accepted full-offsetting of  built-in\r\n\r\nannual  increments and a freeze on  fringe  benefits.\r\n\r\nThe   National  Wages  Council  will  look  into  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of offsetting of not only annual increments\r\n\r\nbut all forms of increases in remuneration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two aspects of wage policies attracted considerable\r\n\r\npublicity  recently. One related to  the  payment  of\r\n\r\nannual  wage supplement. Honourable Members  will  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  recall that in April 1972, the National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil, in an effort to end multitudinous  disputes\r\n\r\nover   bonuses  and  to  provide  for  orderly   wage\r\n\r\nincreases,  recommended that employers be  given  the\r\n\r\noption  of  choosing either an Annual Wage Supplement\r\n\r\n(AWS( plus Annual Bonus or Annual Wage Increase  plus\r\n\r\nAWS.  It also recommended the freezing of the  levels\r\n\r\nof the Annual Wage Supplement. For those who had paid\r\n\r\nbonuses of a month's wages or more before, the Annual\r\n\r\nWage Supplement would be calculated on the average of\r\n\r\nthe  bonuses  of  the last three years  or  the  last\r\n\r\nannual bonus,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhichever was higher, subject to a maximum  of  three\r\n\r\nmonths'  wages.  The  only variation  allowed  was  a\r\n\r\ndecrease  in the Annual Wage Supplement when  trading\r\n\r\nresult or productivity diminishes significantly.  For\r\n\r\nthose  who had not paid bonuses or paid them at  less\r\n\r\nthan  one  month's wage, the Annual  Wage  Supplement\r\n\r\nshould not exceed one month's wage. The annual  bonus\r\n\r\npaid under the first option was negotiable subject to\r\n\r\na   maximum   of  three  months'  wages.  These   NWC\r\n\r\nrecommendations were incorporated in an amendment  to\r\n\r\nSection  46 of the Employment Act which were  debated\r\n\r\nand  approved  in this House and became operative  in\r\n\r\nJuly  1972.  However, it was subsequently found  that\r\n\r\nfirms  could still legally pay Annual Wage Supplement\r\n\r\nin  excess of the frozen quantum. On 26.12.75 Section\r\n\r\n46  was  further  amended to make  it  mandatory  for\r\n\r\nemployers and unions to observe the frozen levels  of\r\n\r\nAnnual  Wage Supplement. At the same time,  provision\r\n\r\nwas  made  for employers to make additional  payments\r\n\r\nsubject to a maximum of three months' wages with  the\r\n\r\nwritten prior consent of the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Bukit Ho Swee has suggested\r\n\r\nthat   employers  be  allowed  to  pay  Annual   Wage\r\n\r\nSupplement  up  to a maximum of three  months'  wages\r\n\r\nwithout  having to apply for Government approval  and\r\n\r\nthat  unions be given the right to request for higher\r\n\r\nAWS  if  employers  made substantial  profits.  These\r\n\r\nproposals  will mean a re-opening of negotiations  on\r\n\r\nadditional  AWS payments in the case  of  many  firms\r\n\r\nwhose  frozen  quantum of AWS is below three  months'\r\n\r\nwages. This will be contrary to the objective of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  wage policy of reducing  disputes  over\r\n\r\nbonuses  in  the  form of Annual Wage Supplement  and\r\n\r\nproviding for orderly wage increases largely  through\r\n\r\nthe  form of NWC wage guidelines It will also not  be\r\n\r\nappropriate  given the uncertain and  more  difficult\r\n\r\nfuture ahead of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey of 2,016 firms conducted last\r\n\r\nyear  by  my  Ministry, 168 firms,  employing  25,192\r\n\r\nworkers, were found to have been paying AWS in excess\r\n\r\nof the frozen quantum. Firms which have not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen   paying  additional  AWS  in  the  past  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to pay only the frozen amount of  AWS.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  lies  with  those who have  paid  above  the\r\n\r\nfrozen  levels  in  the  past.  In  the  interest  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations,  the  Government  has  allowed\r\n\r\nthese  companies  to  maintain  the  1975  level   of\r\n\r\nadditional  AWS  payments if they  continue  to  make\r\n\r\nprofit  in  the year of application. If, however,  in\r\n\r\n1976   or  subsequent  years,  such  companies  incur\r\n\r\nlosses, no additional AWS payment will be allowed and\r\n\r\nthey  will  therefore pay only the frozen  amount  of\r\n\r\nAWS. This is a reasonable solution to the problem  of\r\n\r\nthose  who have paid additional AWS contrary  to  the\r\n\r\npolicy laid down in 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect relates to fringe benefits. The\r\n\r\nlast  NWC  session had recommended a  freeze  on  the\r\n\r\nrange  and  quantum of fringe benefits  for  existing\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  the provision of the minimum  in  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act  for new companies.  There  had  been\r\n\r\npress  reports that some employers had tried to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the present situation  by  withdrawing\r\n\r\naccustomed fringe benefits from their employees after\r\n\r\nthey have joined a trade union. My Ministry considers\r\n\r\nsuch actions anti-union and contrary to the spirit of\r\n\r\ntripartism  which  has  been the  foundation  of  our\r\n\r\nindustrial  harmony.  Unless  there  are  very   good\r\n\r\nreasons, the same fringe benefits should be  paid  as\r\n\r\nbefore unionisation A freeze on fringe benefits is  a\r\n\r\ngood   first   step.   The  subject   needs   further\r\n\r\ndeliberation by the NWC. Fringe benefits need  to  be\r\n\r\nrationalised  and \"bizarre\" ones or those  which  are\r\n\r\nnot  conducive  to  our  economic  growth  should  be\r\n\r\ndiscontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our workers will need to be\r\n\r\nconscientious  and disciplined They must  strive  for\r\n\r\nhigher  skills and competence in the years  ahead  to\r\n\r\nenable  Singapore to achieve a comfortable  level  of\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  in the midst of  a  less  promising\r\n\r\nfuture  of  the world economy. The practice  of  job-hopping  among our young workers must be  curbed.  In\r\n\r\nmost  cases,  job-hopping among our  workers  can  be\r\n\r\nattributed   to   their  lack   of   dedication   and\r\n\r\nprofessional  pride in their job and their  impatient\r\n\r\npursuit   for  higher  monetary  rewards  and   rapid\r\n\r\npromotion As a measure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  discourage job-hopping for frivolous reasons, the\r\n\r\nNational  Wages  Council will be considering  whether\r\n\r\nemployees  who  job-hop should enjoy  the  full  wage\r\n\r\nincrease  recommended.  Several  hon.  Members   have\r\n\r\nspoken on job-hopping. Their concern and reservations\r\n\r\non the matter will be taken fully into account by the\r\n\r\nCouncil  when it deals with the subject.  I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt that in making its recommendations, the Council\r\n\r\nwill  be  mindful  of those workers who  change  jobs\r\n\r\nbecause  of  a  genuine  search  for  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nimprove  their skills. Monetary disincentive at  best\r\n\r\nwill  alleviate the problem to some extent. The  long\r\n\r\nterm   solution   lies  in  employers   taking   more\r\n\r\ninitiatives in building up a stable workforce through\r\n\r\nbetter motivation and concern for their workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our entrepreneurs and managers\r\n\r\nmust also play their part in preserving and improving\r\n\r\nour competitiveness. They must pursue more aggressive\r\n\r\nmarketing  policies. They must seek more determinedly\r\n\r\nto  improve the productivity of their firms. The onus\r\n\r\nof   raising   productivity  rests  with  management.\r\n\r\nDespite  much  encouragement  on  the  part  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, not much progress has been made  in  this\r\n\r\nfield.  Part  of the problem seems to  be  that  both\r\n\r\nemployers  and unions do not know very  much  of  the\r\n\r\nsubject  beyond the desirability of the principle  of\r\n\r\nhigher  productivity. The hon. Member  for  Boon  Lay\r\n\r\nhimself   has   said  he  does  not  know   what   is\r\n\r\nproductivity.  One  can assume that  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  know even less about the matter. The National\r\n\r\nProductivity  Board will have to do more  promotional\r\n\r\nwork in the field of productivity. For the benefit of\r\n\r\nthose  who  were absent in this House last week  when\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Whampoa elucidated on the subject,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to add that productivity means  how  well\r\n\r\none uses our resources whether it is capital, labour,\r\n\r\nmaterials   or  machinery,  to  produce   goods   and\r\n\r\nservices. An increase in productivity can result from\r\n\r\nusing  the  same  amount  of  resources  but  getting\r\n\r\nincreased  output  or  value  of  services   provided\r\n\r\nAlternatively,  you  may get higher  productivity  by\r\n\r\nproducing  the  same  amount of  goods  or  value  of\r\n\r\nservices with reduced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount  of resources. Productivity increases  can  be\r\n\r\nobtained  through  better or more  efficient  use  of\r\n\r\neither  one  or  more  of  the  resources  used   for\r\n\r\nproduction.  Thus, management can  be  improved,  the\r\n\r\ntechnology used upgraded or labour induced to give of\r\n\r\ntheir best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Wages Council has been grappling with\r\n\r\nthis  problem  during its last few sessions.  It  has\r\n\r\ncome  to  the  correct conclusion that while  it  can\r\n\r\nexhort  employers and unions to higher  productivity,\r\n\r\nproductivity guidelines should be worked out  at  the\r\n\r\nplant  level.  I have been informed by  the  National\r\n\r\nProductivity   Board  that  areas  for   productivity\r\n\r\nimprovement  in our firms are many. Employers  should\r\n\r\ninitiate  action to make better use of the  resources\r\n\r\nof  their  firms. If they have difficulties  in  this\r\n\r\nregard,  the National Productivity Board will provide\r\n\r\nthe   necessary  assistance.  The  Board  can   train\r\n\r\nmanagers, supervisors   and   workers   in   modern\r\n\r\nmanagement techniques and systems. It also has a team\r\n\r\nof  experienced consultants who can provide technical\r\n\r\nadvice  to  companies to improve  their  methods  and\r\n\r\nquality   of  production  and  their  marketing   and\r\n\r\nfinancial systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management should also work out productivity\r\n\r\nincentive    schemes.   The   benefits   of    higher\r\n\r\nproductivity  must  be shared between  employers  and\r\n\r\nworkers   This  having  been  said,  it   should   be\r\n\r\nrecognised that schemes to increase productivity will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  worked out, implemented,  and  positive\r\n\r\nresults  achieved before incentive schemes are  drawn\r\n\r\nup.  The  demand by union for incentives  as  a  pre-condition  to  increase  productivity  is  the  other\r\n\r\nreason why employers have adopted a lukewarm attitude\r\n\r\ntowards any productivity scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In opening the NTUC Seminar on \"Maximising the\r\n\r\nBenefits of Productivity\" at the Trade Union House on\r\n\r\n29th October, 1976\r\n\r\nof  NTUC  advised the participants that  productivity\r\n\r\nprogrammes must precede incentive schemes,  not  vice\r\n\r\nversa, and that a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  rewarding strategy for trade unions will be  to\r\n\r\nget  productivity programmes going, make  them  yield\r\n\r\nresults,  and  then proceed to the negotiating  table\r\n\r\nwith  confidence, and self-respect. I would  like  to\r\n\r\ncommend  the MPs who have spoken on this  subject  in\r\n\r\nthis  House as well as the unionists outside to  take\r\n\r\nnote  of their leader's advice. Nevertheless, it  is\r\n\r\ngratifying to note that a number of companies have on\r\n\r\ntheir   own   initiative   implemented   productivity\r\n\r\nincentive  schemes.  Again the National  Productivity\r\n\r\nBoard  will provide the necessary assistance to firms\r\n\r\nwhich  may  have  difficulties  in  setting  up  such\r\n\r\nschemes.   The  Board  has  a  corps  of   industrial\r\n\r\nengineering   consultants  who  are  experienced   in\r\n\r\nsetting up standards of performances which are  basic\r\n\r\nto productivity incentive schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, last year the state of industrial\r\n\r\nrelations remained stable and harmonious. There  were\r\n\r\nfewer number of strikes and other forms of industrial\r\n\r\nactions  than  the previous year.  A  total  of  four\r\n\r\nstrikes and 10 minor work stoppages occurred in  1976\r\n\r\nas  compared  with seven strikes and  19  minor  work\r\n\r\nstoppages  in  1975 The conclusion to be  drawn  from\r\n\r\nthis   happy   situation  is   that   tripartism   is\r\n\r\nprogressing and collective bargaining is  working  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the challenges ahead, it is vital that we\r\n\r\nimprove on the practice of industrial relations so as\r\n\r\nto  achieve greater industrial harmony. This requires\r\n\r\nthe  joint  efforts  of labour,  management  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  My  Ministry will  further  improve  its\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations services  by  adopting  a  more\r\n\r\nalert  and  positive approach to the  prevention  and\r\n\r\nsettlement of industrial disputes. Priority  will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  setting up of a  departmental  Labour\r\n\r\nService to build up a corps of experienced labour and\r\n\r\nindustrial relations officers. At present, almost all\r\n\r\nthe officers in the Ministry are from the common user\r\n\r\ngrades and, as part of their career development, they\r\n\r\nare subject to external postings after a short period\r\n\r\non  the  job  Officers who have the  inclination  and\r\n\r\nflair for such work and the requisite experience  are\r\n\r\nnot  able  to  remain long enough to establish  close\r\n\r\nrapport with both management and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunions alike, and to pass on their experience to  the\r\n\r\nyounger  officers. Furthermore, common user  officers\r\n\r\nmay  not  have the necessary aptitude for such  work.\r\n\r\nWith  a departmental service, the problems associated\r\n\r\nwith  an  open service will be avoided. Only suitably\r\n\r\nqualified  persons and those who  wish  to  make  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Service  their career will be  recruited  and\r\n\r\ntrained.  The Ministry of Finance is now working  out\r\n\r\nwith  my  Ministry  the details of  the  Scheme.  The\r\n\r\nScheme  is  intended to cover 21 Division I officers, 56 Division II officers and 70 Division Ill officers. There  is,  therefore, good prospects for advancement\r\n\r\nwithin the Labour Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade unions had in the past 17 years made\r\n\r\ninvaluable  contributions towards the achievement  of\r\n\r\nthe  national  economic and social  objectives.  They\r\n\r\ncould be counted upon to take the initiative to  work\r\n\r\nfor  better mutual communication with management  and\r\n\r\ninject  greater professionalism among the second  and\r\n\r\nthird  echelon union leaders. Through training,  they\r\n\r\nwill approach labour-management relationships from  a\r\n\r\ncooperative,  not  combative, position  :and  conduct\r\n\r\nnegotiations  with moderation and an acute  awareness\r\n\r\nthat  national  interests must not be sacrificed.  As\r\n\r\nregards   the   third  partner  in   the   tripartite\r\n\r\npartnership,  some of them will have to  discard  the\r\n\r\nobsolete  concept of industrial confrontation  vis-a-vis the union. Personnel mismanagement in the form of\r\n\r\nadoption  of  inflexible and insensitive approach  to\r\n\r\nlabour-management  problems and taking  a  too  rigid\r\n\r\nstand  on  managerial prerogatives must be corrected.\r\n\r\nIn   many  undertakings,  systematic  procedures  for\r\n\r\ncommunication will have to be set up and there should\r\n\r\nbe more consultation between employers and employees.\r\n\r\nThrough better communication, company loyalty can  be\r\n\r\nevolved and misunderstandings leading to disputes can\r\n\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with our dependence on trained and\r\n\r\nproductive  manpower, optimal  utilisation  of   our\r\n\r\nlabour force must always be our goal, Not only is  it\r\n\r\nimportant  for our workers to acquire skills,  utmost\r\n\r\nefforts must be taken to preserve and safeguard our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhuman  resources. The problems of safety  and  health\r\n\r\nattendant  on our rapid industrialisation  have  been\r\n\r\nidentified  by  my  Ministry and over  the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears,  my  Ministry has, contrary to the  impression\r\n\r\ncreated  by  the  statement of the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nPotong PaSir, devoted considerable effort and time to\r\n\r\nimproving  the  industrial safety and health  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities were organised to promote greater safety\r\n\r\nand   health  consciousness  on  the  part  of   both\r\n\r\nmanagements and workers. Three campaigns covering all\r\n\r\nfactories,   the   construction  industry   and   the\r\n\r\nshipbuilding and repairing industry respectively  and\r\n\r\none  safety month for the wood-working industry  have\r\n\r\nbeen held so far, A monthly publication entitled  the\r\n\r\n\"New  Worker\" on the problems relating to safety  and\r\n\r\nhealth  was started in 1973. The Ministry  also  laid\r\n\r\ndown comprehensive standards of industrial safety and\r\n\r\nhealth.   The  Building  Operations  and   Works   of\r\n\r\nEngineering Construction Regulations was  enacted  in\r\n\r\n1971.  A  new Factories Act was brought out in  1973.\r\n\r\nThe Factories Act will be further amended shortly  to\r\n\r\nprovide for enhanced penalties for contraventions  of\r\n\r\nsafety  provisions which are likely to result in  the\r\n\r\ndeath  of  or  bodily injury to workers.  A  code  of\r\n\r\npractice  and  a guidebook were issued  in  1974  for\r\n\r\nconstruction  worksites. Guidebooks  were  issued  on\r\n\r\nvarious  aspects  of safety and  health.  In  1975  a\r\n\r\nguidebook  on  safety in shipyards and  on  fire  and\r\n\r\nexplosions was published. Those on power presses  and\r\n\r\nforklift  trucks  were  released  in  September   and\r\n\r\nOctober  1976  respectively. In 1973, a guidebook  on\r\n\r\nsilicosis was issued. This was followed by  others  - industrial  dermatitis and noise-induced deafness  in\r\n\r\n1975,  and  hearing conservation and  compressed  air\r\n\r\nillness  in November 1976. A van was commissioned  in\r\n\r\nMay  1976 to provide audiometric tests to workers.  A\r\n\r\ntripartite  study  group  on accident  prevention  in\r\n\r\nshipyards  was  set  up  in  1973  and  a  tripartite\r\n\r\nadvisory committee appointed in 1975 to assist in the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of its recommendations.  An  advisory\r\n\r\ncommittee   on   the  construction  industry,   which\r\n\r\nincluded\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of developers and  contractors,  was\r\n\r\nestablished  in 1973. Furthermore, to improve  safety\r\n\r\nadministration  in  factories, the  Ministry  enacted\r\n\r\nlegislation  requiring  the  setting  up  of   safety\r\n\r\ncommittees  and  the appointment of safety  officers.\r\n\r\nTraining  programmes were also organised  for  safety\r\n\r\npersonnel,  supervisors and workers,  and  industrial\r\n\r\nfirst aiders and nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry also expanded its Factory Inspectorate\r\n\r\nfrom  a total establishment of 36 inspectors in  1973\r\n\r\nto  55  inspectors in 1976. The Factory  Inspectorate\r\n\r\nstepped  up its enforcement by increasing the  number\r\n\r\nof  worksite  and factory inspections from  9,995  in\r\n\r\n1973  to  11,528  inspections in 1976.  Consequently,\r\n\r\n8,741   notices  of  noncompliance  were  served   on\r\n\r\noccupiers  in  1976 as compared to 1,689  notices  in 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of these efforts, positive progress has\r\n\r\nbeen   made  in  the  industrial  safety  and  health\r\n\r\nsituation  in our two most accident-prone industries.\r\n\r\nUsing  the  American Standards Association  criteria,\r\n\r\nthe   accident   frequency  and   severity   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry in 1973 were 6.9 accidents  per\r\n\r\nmillion man-hours worked and 3,860 man-days lost  per\r\n\r\nmillion  man-hours  worked as compared  to  the  1976\r\n\r\nstatistics  of  3.0  and  926 respectively.  For  the\r\n\r\nshipbuilding  and  repairing  industry,  the  1   973\r\n\r\naccident  frequency and severity rates were 16.9  and\r\n\r\n2,880  as  compared  with 11.0  and  1,096  for  1976\r\n\r\nrespectively.  These figures show that  the  accident\r\n\r\nrates have declined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this decline is satisfying, nevertheless the\r\n\r\nMinistry is seeking to further improve the industrial\r\n\r\nsafety  and  health  standards in  our  industry.  In\r\n\r\nabsolute  numbers in 1976 there were  698  and  1,095\r\n\r\naccidents  in  construction worksites  and  shipyards\r\n\r\nrespectively as compared with the 1975 figures of 651\r\n\r\nand  1,142  accidents. In terms of fatalities,  there\r\n\r\nwere  in 1976, 32 deaths in the construction industry\r\n\r\nand  15  in the shipbuilding and repairing industry\r\n\r\nThe  comparative figures for these two industries for\r\n\r\n1975 were 36 and 21 fatalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespectively.  There  is some  improvement  but  more\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be  done  especially by  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the construction industry is concerned, the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board, the largest developer,\r\n\r\nhas  agreed to my Ministry's suggestion to set  up  a\r\n\r\nsafety  department and to train its site  supervisors\r\n\r\nin  safety. We will concentrate on solving two  major\r\n\r\ntypes  of accidents - falling from heights and  being\r\n\r\nstruck by falling objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Potong Pasir has said that very\r\n\r\nlittle has been done to retrain our construction  and\r\n\r\nshipyard  workers to cope with the new situation.  He\r\n\r\nmight like to know that in addition to campaigns  and\r\n\r\nthe  supervisors'  courses, the Factory  Inspectorate\r\n\r\nhas  been  conducting safety orientation  courses  at\r\n\r\nconstruction  worksites.  In  addition,  a  film   on\r\n\r\nhazards  in the construction industry to be shown  to\r\n\r\nworkers  will  be  ready  shortly.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nshipyards,  some 13,800 workers have so far  attended\r\n\r\nthe   safety  orientation  course  organised  by   my\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also opined that wooden\r\n\r\nscaffolding  should be replaced by metal scaffolding.\r\n\r\nThis  matter  has  been considered  in  the  past.  A\r\n\r\ncommittee headed by the Director of Public Works made\r\n\r\nrecommendations in 1 972 for the safe use  of  wooden\r\n\r\nscaffolding. Its recommendations were circularised to\r\n\r\nall  contractors. Metal scaffoldings,  although  more\r\n\r\nstable  and mobile, have disadvantages which militate\r\n\r\nagainst  their  usage.  In hot weather,  they  become\r\n\r\nheated which render them difficult to handle. When it\r\n\r\nrains, they are slippery and hazardous. But the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  inhibitive  factor is  one  of  economics.\r\n\r\nMetal  scaffolds are almost three times  more  costly\r\n\r\nthan  wooden  scaffolds. Until  the  costs  of  metal\r\n\r\nscaffolds can be reduced substantially or when we are\r\n\r\nprepared to accept a significant increase in cost  of\r\n\r\nconstruction with the consequent increase  in  rental\r\n\r\nor  selling price of HDB flats, wooden scaffolds will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be used for many more years.  The  hon.\r\n\r\nMember has also argued for metal scaffoldings on  the\r\n\r\ngrounds  that steel girders have to be hauled  up  to\r\n\r\nhigh places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe  might wish to know that such girders are  usually\r\n\r\nhoisted up through proper lifting equipment. It is an\r\n\r\nunsafe   practice  to  pull  them  up   using   metal\r\n\r\nscaffolding.  The  hon. Member for Potong  Pasir  can\r\n\r\nprofitably enrich his knowledge on this subject if he\r\n\r\nacquires a copy of this report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of shipbuilding and repairing industry,\r\n\r\nmy   Ministry,  through  the  Advisory  Committee  on\r\n\r\nAccident  Prevention in the industry, will work  with\r\n\r\nshipyards  to implement industrial safety and  health\r\n\r\nself-regulating  systems as part of their  management\r\n\r\nfunctions.  A  consultancy team has been  set  up  to\r\n\r\nassist  shipyards in this and other safety  problems.\r\n\r\nMy  Ministry  is examining a proposal to  set  up  an\r\n\r\nOccupational Safety and Health Institute  to  provide\r\n\r\ntraining, consultancy  and  research  services.   At\r\n\r\npresent,  training, consultancy  and  research   are\r\n\r\nconducted  on  an  ad hoc basis by different  bodies.\r\n\r\nTherefore an institute to co-ordinate such activities\r\n\r\nappears  necessary,  especially  as  we  continue  to\r\n\r\nindustrialise  and meet other problems of  industrial\r\n\r\nsafety  and  health.  A report submitted  by  an  ILO\r\n\r\nexpert  on  the  matter  is  being  examined  by   my\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I agree with the hon. Member for Potong\r\n\r\nPasir   that  one  important  technique  of  accident\r\n\r\nprevention  is  analysis of accident  statistics.  He\r\n\r\ncomplained   that  the  statistical   data   in   the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  Annual Report lacks vision and  does  not\r\n\r\nallow  employers and workers to pin-point  the  areas\r\n\r\nthat   need  greatest  vigilance.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nstatistical data on industrial safety in  the  Annual\r\n\r\nReport  is to give a summary picture of the situation\r\n\r\nin  the year reported on. It is therefore general and\r\n\r\nnot  meant  for use for specific safety  measures  by\r\n\r\nemployers or workers. The hon.\r\n\r\nMember might like to know that detailed statistics on\r\n\r\nindustrial  accidents in construction  worksites  and\r\n\r\nshipyards  are being maintained and analysed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  These  statistics and their  analysis  are\r\n\r\nsupplied  to the two Advisory Committees for remedial\r\n\r\naction.   These  statistics  are  also  supplied   to\r\n\r\nshipyards  and  contractors. I  might  add  that  any\r\n\r\nemployer  or  occupier should  know  the  nature  and\r\n\r\ncauses of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccidents  in their own factories or worksites.  They\r\n\r\nneed  not  therefore rely on the  Ministry  for  such\r\n\r\nstatistics  as  implied by the hon. Member.  However,\r\n\r\nhis  proposal that safety committees be  required  to\r\n\r\nkeep  standardised  accident frequency  and  severity\r\n\r\nrates   will   be   looked  into   by   the   Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Every\r\n\r\nMember who has spoken seems to be rejuvenated and has\r\n\r\ncome  out quite strongly on certain issues.  If  this\r\n\r\nkeeps  up and the debates remain as constructive  and\r\n\r\nlively, then we shall all be working towards a better\r\n\r\ngovernment and administration for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  of  this  House  have  raised  a  few\r\n\r\nmatters  concerning my Ministry and I would  like  to\r\n\r\nreply  to  them. Firstly, of course, on  sports.  The\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for  Telok Blangah  has  suggested  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of daylight saving so that there can  be\r\n\r\none   more  hour  of  daylight  for  the  people   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in sports. May I point out that there  is\r\n\r\nenough\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndaylight  as  it is for everyone to enjoy recreation,\r\n\r\nif  the  people put their minds to it.  With  prudent\r\n\r\npractice  of stagatime, the ordinary joys of  keeping\r\n\r\nfit can still be the lot of our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his references to facilities for sports and\r\n\r\nrecreation,  the  hon.  Member, whilst  complimenting\r\n\r\n\"the  many excellent facilities\" which are being  set\r\n\r\nup  for the people to enjoy when taking part in  \"all\r\n\r\nforms  of sports and outdoor activities\", feels  that\r\n\r\nthe Master Plan caters for the haves and neglects the\r\n\r\nhave-nots. He may not be aware that one of the  major\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  the  Master  Plan  is  to  meet   the\r\n\r\ndeficiencies  in  popular sports  facilities.  If  he\r\n\r\nmakes  some enquiries and research he would  discover\r\n\r\nthat  there  are facilities in football fields, open\r\n\r\nspaces,  swimming  pools, court surfaces  and  indoor\r\n\r\nhalls  which are largely used by the majority of  our\r\n\r\npeople, young as well as old. One of the offshoots of\r\n\r\nthe  Master  Plan has been the release of  many  more\r\n\r\nschool  fields  and halls, adding  to  the  array  of\r\n\r\nfacilities available to our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has also said that the facilities\r\n\r\nare    revenue-generating   and   this    immediately\r\n\r\neliminates  our younger citizens who cannot  pay.  We\r\n\r\nall know, Sir, that the Government's policy is not to\r\n\r\nprovide  anything for free. Persons using the  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities are expected to pay for their use so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  appreciate  what has  been  provided.  The\r\n\r\nprovision  and  maintenance of all sports  facilities\r\n\r\nare  heavily  subsidised  by Government  grants.  For\r\n\r\nexample, a  football  field  at  Farrer   Park   is\r\n\r\nsubsidised  at 95% in its maintenance costs.  For  22\r\n\r\nyoung persons using a well-maintained football field,\r\n\r\nthe  cost  works out at approximately 15  cents  per\r\n\r\nhead  per  day to the users, but it costs  Government\r\n\r\nabout $57 per day in subsidy. In swimming pools which\r\n\r\nare the most popular facility the subsidy varies from\r\n\r\n50%  -  90%  in  its maintenance costs.  These  costs\r\n\r\nexclude  the  capital  expenditure  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of these facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young also have various fringe benefits as all\r\n\r\nthose in schools pay a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcession rate to swimming poo1s and to the  use  of\r\n\r\ntennis  courts on a school booking basis.  Again  all\r\n\r\nthose in National Service and reservists, who form  a\r\n\r\nlarge  portion of our young citizens, similarly enjoy\r\n\r\nconcession  usage to poo1s and other facilities.  The\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association Youth Group which  number  some\r\n\r\n20,000   in   membership   also   enjoys   concession\r\n\r\nprivileges to swimming pools. The Liaison Officer and\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the  hon. Member's Constituency  Sports\r\n\r\nClub would have been able to tell him that members of\r\n\r\nhis Club too enjoy this latest concession to swimming\r\n\r\npools.  This philosophy of our people paying a little\r\n\r\ntowards usage is to develop an attitude of proper use\r\n\r\nand to prevent abuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also spoke of his disagreement with\r\n\r\nthe  Sports Council's rationale in the Sports for All\r\n\r\npolicy. I would like to quote what our Prime Minister\r\n\r\nsaid when he declared open the National\r\n\r\nStadium:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With a population of just over two million, let us\r\n\r\nnot  waste time to go Out of our way to produce  gold\r\n\r\nmedalists,  whether for Olympic, Asian or SEAP  games\r\n\r\nThere  are  no national benefits from gold  medalists\r\n\r\nfor  smaller  countries. For the super  powers, with\r\n\r\nlarge populations, winning in sports becomes national\r\n\r\npropaganda  to persuade people of the superiority  of\r\n\r\ntheir  competing political systems. But it is foolish\r\n\r\nand  wasteful for the smaller countries to copy  this\r\n\r\n... Any Olympic sports council member or an affiliate\r\n\r\nclub   which  sets  Out  to  persuade  above  average\r\n\r\nsportsman or sportswoman to devote the best years  of\r\n\r\ntheir  lives to training and becoming gold  medalists\r\n\r\nwill  find their zeal misplaced, and funds  cut  off,\r\n\r\nFor they will do an injustice to these persons ...`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also said elsewhere that the Government's\r\n\r\npolicy of Sports for All cannot be achieved if sports\r\n\r\nare  confined  only to the constituency  level.  More\r\n\r\nemphasis will be placed on inter-constituency  sports\r\n\r\nto  enable  a  broad base for sports to be  built  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is through the building of a broad base\r\n\r\nfor  sports that Singapore can hope to produce world-ranking sportsmen or sportswomen. Our priority is  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  healthy and robust society. We  should  not\r\n\r\nspend our time, effort and money in trying to produce\r\n\r\nworld champions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country needs the people who are fit and if\r\n\r\nchampions rise through our popular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbase  of  sports-consciousness, then  we  shall   be\r\n\r\nthankful. But we do not need to produce champions  in\r\n\r\norder  to encourage sports participation. Our society\r\n\r\nhas  not  the  infrastructure to support  the  narrow\r\n\r\npursuit  of champion production. On the contrary,  it\r\n\r\nis  unproductive.  We  do not  need  to  purposefully\r\n\r\nstrive  to  produce a Pele or a Mark Spitz.  What  we\r\n\r\nwant  is  a nation of fair-minded sportsmen, able  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  a  competition  in amateur  earnestness  among\r\n\r\nfriends  and  neighbours, to  enjoy  the  thrills  of\r\n\r\nskilled  display  in  the  Athenian  sense  but   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  to  see  regimented  materialistic   and\r\n\r\nselfish  modern gladiators, unable to think  and  act\r\n\r\nbeyond the chase of gladiatorial glory. To this  end.\r\n\r\nthe  SSC  with  the  warm support  of  sponsors  have\r\n\r\nschemes  for  the  improvements  of  skills  and  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of a skilled base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the hon. Member's observation that Constituency\r\n\r\nGames  are  not  popular, for his information,  since\r\n\r\n1972  when  Inter-Constituency Games were  introduced\r\n\r\nthere has been a steady growth not only in the number\r\n\r\nof  games but also in the number of participants. For\r\n\r\nexample,   the   Inter-Constituency   Table    Tennis\r\n\r\nTournament  of  1977 has drawn 66  teams  out  of  69\r\n\r\nconstituencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the suggestion that Constituency Sports Rules be\r\n\r\namended  to allow sponsorship by business  firms,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not adopt a commercial hard sell for  sports.\r\n\r\nWe  do  not want each constituency game to  become  a\r\n\r\nduplication  of a Business House League.  Donors  and\r\n\r\nsponsors are there and have been there. There  should\r\n\r\nbe  no  cause  and  call for blatant  advertising  by\r\n\r\nsponsors.   It  is  the  subtlety  and   quality   of\r\n\r\nharnessing  scant resources towards desirable  sports\r\n\r\npromotion   that  have  hallmarked  our  constituency\r\n\r\nsports promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the recommendation by the hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Whampoa that constituency sports clubs  be\r\n\r\ngiven  more  generous funds, the Sports Council  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  provide  grants  to  help  constituency\r\n\r\nsports  clubs  in  their  efforts  to  promote   mass\r\n\r\nparticipation in sports. There\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  still no substitute for self-sustenance in sports\r\n\r\npromotion  and I would urge that MPs should  continue\r\n\r\nwith  their  exemplary  leadership  and  approach  in\r\n\r\nobtaining funds for constituency sports promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Long Kee has suggested that a\r\n\r\nDepartment or Ministry be set up to probe into  youth\r\n\r\nproblems. I would like to point out that there  is  a\r\n\r\nNational  Youth  Co-ordinating  Committee  under  the\r\n\r\nchairmanship   of  the  People's  Association.   This\r\n\r\nCommittee co-ordinates youth activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some comments on the care of the\r\n\r\naged.  Increasing  attention is being  given  to  the\r\n\r\naged,  particularly those who are destitute and  have\r\n\r\nno  families  or close relatives. The  destitute  old\r\n\r\npeople are granted public assistance allowance by the\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare Department. Those not able to  manage\r\n\r\non  their  own and requiring institutional  care  are\r\n\r\nplaced  in  the Woodlands Home for the Aged,  an  old\r\n\r\npeople's  home  run  by  the Department, or  in  old\r\n\r\npeople's  homes  run  by voluntary  organisations.  I\r\n\r\nfeel, as far as possible, old people should live  in\r\n\r\nthe  community  rather  than  be  admitted  into   an\r\n\r\ninstitution. So, efforts are being made to  encourage\r\n\r\nself-help among the aged so that given financial  aid\r\n\r\nor  supportive help they can continue to live  within\r\n\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that more has to be done for the aged,\r\n\r\nbut  the  Government alone cannot be expected  to  do\r\n\r\nall. Voluntary efforts and community involvement  are\r\n\r\nnecessary. The community is encouraged to  assist  in\r\n\r\nproviding services to the aged. Various youth  groups\r\n\r\nand  voluntary welfare organisations are  playing  an\r\n\r\nimportant  part.  While more is being  done  for  the\r\n\r\naged,  the  Government is aware that it may encourage\r\n\r\nrejection  or  abandonment  of  the  aged  by   their\r\n\r\nfamilies.  The  call to instil filial  piety  in  our\r\n\r\nchildren and youth is welcomed The most effective way\r\n\r\nis through the families and our education system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Whampoa and the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nPotong Pasir have commented on the inadequacy of  the\r\n\r\nquantum of Public Assistance. The rates of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic  Assistance have just been revised last  year,\r\n\r\n1st March, 1976 by 40% because of the substantial\r\n\r\nincrease in the prices of essential commodities since\r\n\r\nJanuary 1973 when the rates were last revised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since March last year, prices of essential\r\n\r\ncommodities  have  not  changed  much  to  warrant  a\r\n\r\nfurther  review  of  the Public Assistance  rates  at\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hon. Members are aware that the rates of\r\n\r\nPublic  Assistance are $40 per month for  a  Head  of\r\n\r\nHousehold.  $26 per month for the wife  and  $17  per\r\n\r\nmonth  for  each dependant, subject to a  maximum  of\r\n\r\n$100 per household.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relief recipients, in addition to receiving Public\r\n\r\nAssistance  are also receiving benefits in  cash  and\r\n\r\nkind    from    charitable   bodies   and   voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations.  Free medical treatment  is  given  by\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  those who are ill.  Fares  are  also\r\n\r\ngiven   to  relief  recipients  attending  Government\r\n\r\nhospitals and clinics for medical treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort is made to encourage even the aged and\r\n\r\nthe  handicapped to do whatever casual work that  may\r\n\r\nbe available. This is partly to enable them to get  a\r\n\r\nlittle extra income from elsewhere so that they  need\r\n\r\nnot   be   dependent  on  Government   relief.   More\r\n\r\nimportantly,  some casual work will relieve  them  of\r\n\r\ntheir  boredom  and loneliness and make  their  lives\r\n\r\nmore meaningful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria for Public Assistance is stringent and\r\n\r\nthose  recipients who are able but unwilling to  work\r\n\r\nare disqualified from Public Assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1976, $3.6 million was disbursed in Public\r\n\r\nAssistance to a monthly average of 6,640 families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the case mentioned by the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Potong Pasir, I would like to state  that\r\n\r\nit  is not possible that the old lady and her husband\r\n\r\nhad  their Public Assistance reduced to $20 when  she\r\n\r\nwas  hospitalised If the hon. Member can  provide  me\r\n\r\nwith further\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninformation, I shall have the case investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Welfare Department ensures that relief\r\n\r\nrecipients  are able to collect their  allowances  at\r\n\r\nCentres nearest their homes so that they need not  be\r\n\r\ninconvenienced  or  pay  unnecessary  expenditure  on\r\n\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the head of a household is unable to collect\r\n\r\nthe allowance due to illness or other reasons, he can\r\n\r\nauthorise his wife or another person to collect it on\r\n\r\nhis behalf. Where a recipient is unable to get anyone\r\n\r\nto  collect  on  his  behalf, the  Public  Assistance\r\n\r\nallowance  is  made to the recipient  by  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department staff at his home. In  all  cases\r\n\r\nwhere the recipients are ill or found to be bedridden\r\n\r\nand there is no one to collect on their behalf, their\r\n\r\nallowances are always paid to them at their homes  or\r\n\r\nat  the  hospitals  by staff of  the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Whampoa had asked why there is\r\n\r\nno  provision of legal aid for criminal cases,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  murder  cases  He also mentioned  that  a  poor\r\n\r\nperson who is unfortunate enough to be involved in  a\r\n\r\ncriminal  case  and  who cannot afford  a  lawyer  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to suffer more injustice. Whilst it  is  true\r\n\r\nthat  the  legislation which set  up  the  Legal  Aid\r\n\r\nBureau  way back in 1958 did envisage granting  legal\r\n\r\naid  in  criminal cases, it was decided not to  bring\r\n\r\ninto operation this part of the legislation as it was\r\n\r\nfelt  that  there was a greater need with  regard  to\r\n\r\ncivil  matters then as now where legal aid  would  be\r\n\r\nmore effectively used to the benefit of our citizens.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when  the Legal Aid Bureau  started  to\r\n\r\nfunction, it confined itself solely to civil matters.\r\n\r\nThe Director and four Assistants dealt with a lot  of\r\n\r\ncivil claims, ranging from the recovery of small sums\r\n\r\nof  less than $1,000 to the recovery of premises  and\r\n\r\nacting for squatters who were dispossessed when their\r\n\r\nlands  were  reclaimed by their  owners  without  any\r\n\r\ncompensation whatsoever, although the squatters might\r\n\r\nwell have been in occupation for decades. Since then.\r\n\r\nthe activities of the Legal Aid Bureau have spread to\r\n\r\nall the branches of the civil law, including drafting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontracts  and  helping widows and  dependants  claim\r\n\r\ntheir  dues from deceaseds' estates. They  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  most active and helpful to wives who have  been\r\n\r\ndeserted and left without means of support. It is  in\r\n\r\nmatrimonial  cases  that  the  Legal  Aid  Bureau  at\r\n\r\npresent   provides  the  most  appreciated  form   of\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in regard to legal aid in civil cases, the\r\n\r\nDirector  and his present staff have, at times,  been\r\n\r\ncompelled to farm out their cases to members  of  the\r\n\r\nlegal  profession. Accordingly, they find  themselves\r\n\r\nquite  unable  to  cope with any increase  that  must\r\n\r\nsurely  come  if and when the legal aid  in  criminal\r\n\r\ncases is introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time that a request for the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  this  part  of  the   legal   aid\r\n\r\nlegislation  has  been made to me. I  have  had  such\r\n\r\nrequests since the early sixties but on each occasion\r\n\r\nI  have  been unable to bring about the operation  of\r\n\r\nthis  part of the legislation mainly because  of  two\r\n\r\nreasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the tremendous amount of cost that would have\r\n\r\nbeen involved; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) it is felt that all prosecutions, being\r\n\r\nsupervised  by  the Attorney-General, would  only  be\r\n\r\nbrought  by the Police in cases where there is  prima\r\n\r\nfacie evidence against the accused, so that instances\r\n\r\nof  injustice that may arise from a prosecution being\r\n\r\ninstituted  against  a citizen,  is  reduced  to  the\r\n\r\nbarest minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry feels that the social need for legal\r\n\r\naid in criminal cases in Singapore is not as great as\r\n\r\nto  warrant its introduction now, but we do  have  in\r\n\r\nmind  its  social  benefits and when  the, need  and\r\n\r\nexpense  that  will be incurred with its introduction\r\n\r\nare  justified,  it  will certainly  be  given  every\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just\r\n\r\nclarify?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Sir, the Member can make his\r\n\r\nclarification after I have completed my speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is considering setting up a committee of\r\n\r\nofficials to look into the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimmediate  welfare problems which have  arisen  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  developments and,  in  consultation  with\r\n\r\nofficials   of  relevant  Ministries,  to   see   how\r\n\r\nassistance  can  be rendered in areas  such  as  rent\r\n\r\narrears   cases, allocation  of  flats  and   hawker\r\n\r\nlicences to welfare cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, quite a large number of points have\r\n\r\nbeen raised by hon.

Member\r\n\r\nfor Kampong Chai Chee as a rat catcher has spread far\r\n\r\nand  wide.  We also know him as a good story  teller.\r\n\r\nBut when he last spoke he revealed that he is also  a\r\n\r\nfortune teller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told us he foresaw the traffic jam that would\r\n\r\nresult  from  development  in  the  Central  Business\r\n\r\nDistrict  and  in  vain did he warn the  HDB  against\r\n\r\nbuilding  one-room  flats which  he  predicted  would\r\n\r\nbecome future slums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us examine why no heed was taken of the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member's  warning and,  in  doing  so,  let  us\r\n\r\nremember that the period was more than a decade  ago.\r\n\r\ni.e, in  the early 6Os - a period of a world removed\r\n\r\nfrom  now.  Then, we were faced with the problems  of\r\n\r\npoverty, of shortages and of unemployment. Now, after\r\n\r\n1  7  years of political stability, economic progress\r\n\r\nand social development, we are faced with a different\r\n\r\nset  of  problems, though I say it is a more pleasant\r\n\r\nset  of  problems  to  face than  the  one  we  faced\r\n\r\npreviously, and  that  is  the  problem  of   higher\r\n\r\nexpectations as a result of growing affluence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average human being has a high propensity to\r\n\r\nforget  the  unpleasant incidents in life.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nuseful quality and helps to keep him sane. The Member\r\n\r\nfor Kampong Chai\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChee must have this quality in a high degree, and  in\r\n\r\nthe   midst  of  his  great  oration,  he  must  have\r\n\r\nforgotten  that  we were once faced  with  a  serious\r\n\r\nshortage of housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was not much construction activity, as you\r\n\r\nwill remember, Sir, in the period between the end  of\r\n\r\nthe   Second  World  War  and  the  early  60's.  The\r\n\r\npopulation, however, had expanded  due  to  natural\r\n\r\ngrowth and immigration and shanty towns or slums were\r\n\r\nfound all over Singapore. To the head of a family,  a\r\n\r\none-room flat in more hygienic surroundings  was  far\r\n\r\nbetter   than  his  overcrowded, smelly   and   dark\r\n\r\naccommodation. A one-room flat then with its  running\r\n\r\nwater.,  modern  sanitation, electricity  supply  and\r\n\r\nproper  kitchen was heaven compared to the congested,\r\n\r\nrat  infested, unhealthy and fire prone hovel  of  an\r\n\r\nattap hut he occupied. Many hon. Members present here\r\n\r\ntoday  must  have remembered how an applicant's  face\r\n\r\nlit  up when he was allocated any HDB flat. He  could\r\n\r\nnot afford to be choosy then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for decent housing was urgent. Many\r\n\r\napplicants could only afford to rent one-room  flats.\r\n\r\nOne  must  remember that the average income then  was\r\n\r\n$124.58  per month as against the present  income  of\r\n\r\n$506.73 per month. So whether we like it or not,  the\r\n\r\ndecision  was taken to build these one-room emergency\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one-room flat has served its purpose. It is\r\n\r\nstill   useful  and  will  still  be  useful.   While\r\n\r\nlistening  to the hon. Member for Kampong  Chai  Chee\r\n\r\nthe  other  day, I remembered a local  Malay  proverb\r\n\r\nLepas  jambatan buang tongkat, that is to say, \"Throw\r\n\r\naway   the  walking  stick  which  aided  you, after\r\n\r\ncrossing  the bridge\". Lest we forget,  the  poor  is\r\n\r\nstill  with  us and there will be a continual  demand\r\n\r\nfor one-room flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of hon. Members, there are\r\n\r\n3,587 applicants on the waiting list to rent one-room\r\n\r\nflats.  This is 25% of the 14,086 applicants  on  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  list  to rent flats as at the  end  of  last\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, to come to the Member's suggestion that we\r\n\r\nshould do away with the one-room\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflats.  Listening to him, I thought  it  was  a  very\r\n\r\nsimple  thing.  I only wish I had a magic  wand.  But\r\n\r\neven though I had a magic wand which could, with  one\r\n\r\nwave  change the one-room flats into an old  people's\r\n\r\nhome  or a community centre, I would not use  it  for\r\n\r\nthe simple reason that there would be trouble. He has\r\n\r\nnot thought out the problem properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, hon. Members must be aware that\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  improvement in design  as  well  as\r\n\r\nenlargement  of the built-up area of HDB  flats.  For\r\n\r\nexample, when the first flat was built, the built-up\r\n\r\narea  of the one-room flat was 240 sq ft. It was then\r\n\r\nincreased  to 320 sq ft. As we went on and  began  to\r\n\r\nlearn from the mistakes made, it was increased to 350\r\n\r\nsq  ft  and the present one-room improved flat has  a\r\n\r\nfloor area of 370 sq ft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the rat catcher - I am sorry.

So  to\r\n\r\ncharge  a two-room flat for the price of one  is  not\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, on a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.

Sir, I\r\n\r\nsaid  in my speech that although this was done in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency, I decried the fact that the people were\r\n\r\nbeing deprived of the cheap rental, I suggested  that\r\n\r\nin  future  improvements might  be  made  by  way  of\r\n\r\nincreased ventilation and so on, but not to  increase\r\n\r\nthe rent. I hope that helps the hon. Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, it does help me to\r\n\r\nrefresh  my memory of what he has said. But  it  does\r\n\r\nnot  contest my point that you cannot rent out a two-room flat for the price of a one-room flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB is aware and is very sympathetic with the\r\n\r\ndesire  of  the  residents of the older  estates  for\r\n\r\nimproved  recreational facilities and amenities  such\r\n\r\nas  those available in the new estates. It has  drawn\r\n\r\nup  a  programme to improve facilities in  the  older\r\n\r\nestates.  This, however, will  take  time  and  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers   must   understand  that  improvements   are\r\n\r\nrestricted   by  physical  limitations  of   existing\r\n\r\nenvironment. There are also competing interests,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  do we provide car parks or open space?  The\r\n\r\nHDB  will endeavour to strike a happy balance between\r\n\r\nthese competing interests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of resettlement was also raised,\r\n\r\nResettlement  is  a  most  unpleasant  but  necessary\r\n\r\nexercise. It has been the Government's policy to  try\r\n\r\nand ameliorate the sufferings and hardship caused  to\r\n\r\nthose resettled. Much as we like to, we are unable to\r\n\r\noffer the same facilities to non-citizens as we do to\r\n\r\nour   own,   that   is,   giving   them   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation. Priority is always\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  to  our  own citizens and as hon  Members  are\r\n\r\naware,  we have now more than 80,000 families waiting\r\n\r\nfor  public  housing in addition to our own  citizens\r\n\r\nwho are affected by resettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, the rules have been relaxed\r\n\r\nto give special consideration for permanent residents\r\n\r\nwho  are  affected  by resettlement  schemes  to  get\r\n\r\npublic housing on rental if one of their children  is\r\n\r\nthe holder of a Singapore pink identity card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Resettlement Department has been offering\r\n\r\nalternative  shops  to  all shopkeepers  affected  by\r\n\r\nclearance  scheme  in  so far  as  their  trades  are\r\n\r\nsuitable  to  be  carried out in such  premises.  The\r\n\r\noffer  is  open  to citizens as well as non-citizens.\r\n\r\nThe  only  difference is that in  the  case  of  non-citizens,  they  are not given rental concession  for\r\n\r\nthe  shops as these benefits are only offered to  the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers who are Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come to another subject, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nreally  surprised that quite a number of  Members  in\r\n\r\nthis  House do not know what the surcharge on  a  PUB\r\n\r\nbill  is.  Many  Members referred  to  it  as  a  PUB\r\n\r\nsurcharge. It is not a PUB surcharge. It is a  charge\r\n\r\nimposed as part of Government's fiscal policy and the\r\n\r\nPUB acts as collecting agent for the Government as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of convenience. It does not form part  of  PU\r\n\r\nB's  revenue and the PUB has no authority to  impose,\r\n\r\nincrease,  reduce  or  remove it.  Hon.  Members  who\r\n\r\nrequest   the  PUB  to  explain  or  reconsider   the\r\n\r\nsurcharge are barking up the wrong tree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Which is the right tree to bark?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Perhaps the appropriate place is to\r\n\r\nraise it during the Budget debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon.

Members may be interested\r\n\r\nto  know  that  70%  of  our domestic  consumers  are\r\n\r\nexempted  from  the surcharge as their total  monthly\r\n\r\nbills are less than $35. About 14% pay tax at 5%  and\r\n\r\nthe  remainder  pay  10% as their  bills  exceed  $50\r\n\r\nmonthly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the fourfold increase in the price of\r\n\r\noil, electricity  and  gas  charges  have  gone   up\r\n\r\nconsiderably, and so have complaints over PUB  bills.\r\n\r\nThis  increase  in complaints is not only  common  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  is  a phenomenon  common  to  utility\r\n\r\nauthorities  in  other countries too. However,  there\r\n\r\nhas  been quite a number of queries raised by Members\r\n\r\nover PUB bills and to assist them to explain to their\r\n\r\nconstituents,  the PUB has set up a  team  to  assist\r\n\r\nMembers  at  meet-the-people  sessions  in  answering\r\n\r\nqueries from their constituents. The hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Chai  Chee  has made use  of  the  services.\r\n\r\nRecently, he had a team from the PUB at his meet-the-people session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> No. It was a forum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> I am sorry. Meet-the-people forum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> It is still wrong. It was just a\r\n\r\nforum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Right! Just a forum where they met\r\n\r\nand  discussed the queries which his constituents had\r\n\r\nraised.  It was a useful session except for the  fact\r\n\r\nthat the hon. Member was playing the hero and baiting\r\n\r\nthe members of the PUB team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in this House have heard from time to time about\r\n\r\nhow  uncivil some of our civil servants are.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nit is not out of turn for me to say that from time to\r\n\r\ntime  we  also must remind ourselves that  we  should\r\n\r\nbehave  towards civil servants as we expect  them  to\r\n\r\nbehave towards us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it is very difficult sometimes to resist the\r\n\r\ntemptation  to  play  the  hero  in  front  of   your\r\n\r\nconstituents but do not do it please at  the  expense\r\n\r\nof those who cannot or will not answer back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hold no brief for the rude civil servant but I\r\n\r\nhope  and  expect  that Members  of  Parliament  will\r\n\r\nalways  behave  as political leaders should.  Members\r\n\r\nwho want to make use of the services of this team  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  explain some of the queries  which  their\r\n\r\nconstituents may raise with regard to their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbills,  please contact the PRO. Arrangements will  be\r\n\r\nmade accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned sometime ago that the PUB is\r\n\r\nencouraging  its consumers to read their  own  meters\r\n\r\nand  they  will  be  billed according  to  their  own\r\n\r\nreadings.  This  will  thus reduce  complaints  about\r\n\r\nwrong meter readings and/or over-charging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pamphlets explaining the reading of utility meters\r\n\r\nwere  sent out to all the 470,000-odd consumers.  But\r\n\r\nso  far, only about 1,000 consumers are  sending  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  readings  for billing.  The  campaign  to\r\n\r\nencourage  consumers to read their  own  meters  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  and  the Board is working on  a  scheme  to\r\n\r\nenable  the consumers to submit their meter  readings\r\n\r\non prepaid postage cards. I hope the response will be\r\n\r\nmore positive this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Kim Seng suggests a public\r\n\r\ndebate  before  fixing  PUB  charges.  Charging   and\r\n\r\npricing  of  utilities is a very  complicated  affair\r\n\r\nunlike  pricing  a grocery item off the  shelf.  Take\r\n\r\nelectricity charges, for instance. Different  charges\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  worked  out  for  different  types   of\r\n\r\nconsumers.  There  are  the  domestic  low  and  high\r\n\r\ntension  consumers;  the  industrial  low  and   high\r\n\r\ntension  consumers and the commercial  low  and  high\r\n\r\ntension  consumers. Some of these consumers  have  to\r\n\r\npay  a  maximum demand charge in addition to  others.\r\n\r\nThese  are but some of the factors which have  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken   into  consideration  when  you  draw  up   an\r\n\r\nelectrical tariff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of Members, for the last\r\n\r\nrevision of electrical tariffs by the PUB, we engaged\r\n\r\na  very  well-known electrical and tariff specialist.\r\n\r\nIt   took  this  specialist,  a  well-known  company,\r\n\r\nMessrs. Electro Watts. 2 1/2 years of very careful study\r\n\r\nand evaluation before recommending a tariff which  we\r\n\r\naccepted.  That is the new tariff in which  the  same\r\n\r\ncharge is levied for electricity, whether it is  used\r\n\r\nfor  power or for lighting. It is not a simple thing.\r\n\r\nSo  to suggest that we have a public debate with  the\r\n\r\ncommon   laymen  before  you  fix  PUB   charges   is\r\n\r\ntantamount, Mr Speaker, Sir, to my asking you whether\r\n\r\nyou would seek the opinion of the butcher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore you embark on a very complicated operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.51 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to clarify\r\n\r\na  few  points. The first point is that  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nHouse   will  note  that  I  allowed  myself  to   be\r\n\r\ninterrupted twice by a Senior Minister and I was  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to clarify my position with one Minister  So\r\n\r\nthe  standard  is clear for all of us to  assess  and\r\n\r\nwatch.  If  that is gentlemanly etiquette  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister expected, perhaps this is an example of what\r\n\r\nhe meant by gentlemanly etiquette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, just a few points, Sir, When I referred to the\r\n\r\none-room unit. I was referring to the emergency  type\r\n\r\none-room  unit  and not the improved  type  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister has mentioned. That is the first point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is with regard to my reputation or\r\n\r\nwhatever fame the Minister has bestowed on  me  as  a\r\n\r\nrat  catcher. I did not ask for it. I would not  have\r\n\r\nbeen a rat catcher if the Hon. Minister or some other\r\n\r\nMember  had stood in that constituency, when somebody\r\n\r\nelse would have been the tat catcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, Sir, If the PUB claims to have\r\n\r\ndone so much for the people, I just want to know  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  the construction of the PUB swimming  pool.\r\n\r\nthe  saline content of that swimming pool and whether\r\n\r\nwe, the consumers, since we pay PUB charges, are also\r\n\r\nentitled  to  take advantage of that  pool  which  is\r\n\r\nright at the roof-top of the new PUB building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nknow  that the Hon Minister is known for his debating\r\n\r\nskill and verbal -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I  would like to ask whether, if the  children\r\n\r\nare  minors, but born in Singapore, this aspect could\r\n\r\nbe given consideration?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, When a child holds\r\n\r\na card, it means that he is\r\n\r\ngrown  up.

The true  situation  is\r\n\r\nthat in such a circumstance, the HDB would effect  an\r\n\r\nimmediate  transfer to the next-of-kin of the  tenant\r\n\r\nin  the  case of rental or the lessee in the case  of\r\n\r\npurchase.  The immediate family who are  non-citizens\r\n\r\nbut are permanent residents also qualify. This policy\r\n\r\nalso  applies to applicants on the waiting  list  for\r\n\r\nHDB flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Minister has replied to a number of queries\r\n\r\non the lack of recreational facilities as brought up\r\n\r\nby the Member for Aljunied. Perhaps for the new\r\n\r\nMember for Changi who complained vigorously on the\r\n\r\npoor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkmanship in the construction of HDB flats, may  I.\r\n\r\nfor   brevity,   say  that  these  observations   and\r\n\r\ncomplaints  were  made  at the last  Budget  session.\r\n\r\nCould  I, therefore, indulge upon him to look up  the\r\n\r\nHansard  where all the reasons have been  enunciated.\r\n\r\nOne important point perhaps he should bear in mind is\r\n\r\nthat  in  1976  the  Housing  and  Development  Board\r\n\r\ncompleted a total of 30,024 units of flats and shops.\r\n\r\nThis  is  almost twice the number of 16.147 units  of\r\n\r\nflats  and shops completed by the Board in  1971.  In\r\n\r\nterms  of  volume, this is four times the  amount  of\r\n\r\nbuilding space put in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I can just summarise for him, in general\r\n\r\nheadings,  what  the  HDB has done  to  prevent  this\r\n\r\ncomplaint   of   poor  workmanship;   starting   from\r\n\r\napprenticeship  schemes with the Industrial  Training\r\n\r\nBoard.  He may have heard that the HDB has introduced\r\n\r\na  merit star incentive scheme for contractors. There\r\n\r\nis  also an experimental scheme with different  types\r\n\r\nof construction, such as the Danish industrial method\r\n\r\nof  construction, the Australian progressive strength\r\n\r\nmethod  of  construction, and  a  scheme  called  the\r\n\r\nmental  formwork. So if he really wants to  know  all\r\n\r\nthe details, could he please refer to the Hansard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another complaint by the hon Member for Changi\r\n\r\nis  that  the  HDB  does not give clear  instructions\r\n\r\nregarding regulations governing renovation of  flats.\r\n\r\nThis  is also a general complaint made by a few other\r\n\r\nMPs.  Let me state categorically that the regulations\r\n\r\ngoverning  renovation work in HDB flats are extremely\r\n\r\nclear  The procedure following the balloting of flats\r\n\r\nis  that  the  successful  applicants  are  given   a\r\n\r\nresident   handbook  providing  all   the   necessary\r\n\r\ninformation  concerning application for  permits  for\r\n\r\nrenovation.  It also gives a list of contractors  who\r\n\r\nare  licensed  to  carry  out  such  renovation.  The\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the  purchasers of the  flats  have  no\r\n\r\ndifficulty  at  all  in following  these  regulations\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  is  a minority of  flat  owners  who\r\n\r\ndisregard  the  regulations, and therefore  run  into\r\n\r\ndifficulties with the Board. A common example is  the\r\n\r\nremoval  of  the wall tiles and also the construction\r\n\r\nof a raised platform on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  floor. The HDB has to take stringent  action  on\r\n\r\nthis  as it has resulted in overloading of the  floor\r\n\r\nwhich in turn gives rise to a reduction of the height\r\n\r\nbetween the floor and the ceiling of the flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member has also mentioned the concession\r\n\r\nshops at Changi. Perhaps he may want to know that out\r\n\r\nof  a  total of 46 shops in Changi Village which were\r\n\r\nlet out solely to resettlement cases in January 1976,\r\n\r\nthe rising rental is only $277 to $555. Out of the 46\r\n\r\nshops  let out, only one is left vacant. This  vacant\r\n\r\nshop was open for public tender and the public tender\r\n\r\nwas  $750 per month. It is therefore unreasonable  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that the concession rentals are the cause  of\r\n\r\npoor   business.  However,  the  Ministry  will  keep\r\n\r\nmonitoring the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson brought up the question of HDB\r\n\r\nmaintenance  charges.  I am  surprised  that  he  has\r\n\r\nraised this question because he actually spends  part\r\n\r\nof  his time at the HDB and he should know about  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance charges. Since he is not here now,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot think I shall answer his question because I think\r\n\r\nhe knows what it is all about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next observation made by the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah as well as the Member for Punggol is on\r\n\r\nbetter timing of bus services to new housing estates.\r\n\r\nI  think  that  is a valid observation.  The  HDB  is\r\n\r\nequally  concerned  and,  therefore,  the  Board  has\r\n\r\ninstituted a number of formal channels together  with\r\n\r\nthe  SBS in order to plan a proper time schedule  for\r\n\r\nbuses serving new estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance for financially needy tenants was\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  the hon. Member for  Ang  Mo  Kio.  It\r\n\r\nsuffices for me merely to mention that his concern is\r\n\r\nwell  placed, and that the HDB is helping these needy\r\n\r\ntenants  in  various ways: for example,  giving  them\r\n\r\nspecial consideration for hawker stalls, by informing\r\n\r\nthe  various CCCs and MCs and also the Social Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment on their need for financial assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Whampoa has mentioned that the\r\n\r\nHDB should be careful in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nselecting  proper sites for hawkers. That observation\r\n\r\nis  noted  and I can say that that is actually  being\r\n\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another observation made by the Member for Whampoa\r\n\r\nis on the question of designing window grilles. Here,\r\n\r\nthe   Board   must  explain  that  it  is   obviously\r\n\r\nundesirable to give a free hand in the decoration  of\r\n\r\nflats  to the whims and fancies of each occupier.  As\r\n\r\nfar as the internal surfacing is concerned, they have\r\n\r\na  free  choice.  But  for external  presentation,  a\r\n\r\ncertain  conformity is required. If there is lack  of\r\n\r\nsuch  control  in some blocks of private  flats,  the\r\n\r\nresult  is  a  chaotic presentation of  exteriors  of\r\n\r\nbuildings which becomes an eyesore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> A point of clarification, Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, On this point of window grilles,\r\n\r\nI do not see how this can affect the exterior. I have\r\n\r\nlooked  at  many  private flats and  they  look  very\r\n\r\nbeautiful It is a matter of taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, as the Member has correctly pointed out, it is a\r\n\r\nmatter   of  taste.  And  since  the  HDB  has   that\r\n\r\nauthority, the taste is HDB's. Anyway, we will try to\r\n\r\ngive as best a design as we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also brought up the question of open\r\n\r\nair coffee shops. I would like to mention that coffee\r\n\r\nshops  also  involve the Ministry of the Environment.\r\n\r\nIf  more  tables and chairs are allowed in  the  open\r\n\r\nareas,  there  is a possibility that  they  may  need\r\n\r\nlarger  kitchens,  perhaps bigger toilets,  and  this\r\n\r\ncould lead to the problem of obstruction and to other\r\n\r\ncomplaints from residents or proprietors of  adjacent\r\n\r\nshops.   From  experience,  there  have   been   such\r\n\r\ncomplaints  in  the  past and even  of  incidents  of\r\n\r\nfights,  and  the HDB therefore stringently  observes\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of  not  allowing extensions  into  open\r\n\r\nareas.  Anyway, let me assure the Member that if  any\r\n\r\ncase merits consideration, it will be so given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member's observation on one-room flats has\r\n\r\nbeen ably explained by my Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next lot of questions from Members is on\r\n\r\nresettlement.  Here again. I am glad  that  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong is not here because he is extremely\r\n\r\npersevering. He has brought up the question  of  bona\r\n\r\nfide farmer, every now and then. In fact. I just want\r\n\r\nto  tell him that a bona fide farmer has been defined\r\n\r\nas  one  whose  livelihood is entirely  dependent  on\r\n\r\nfarming,  and that subject has been brought  up  many\r\n\r\ntimes in the last Parliament where he had asked  some\r\n\r\nquestions  and  we had given him some replies.  So  I\r\n\r\nthink there is no point `In labouring through all the\r\n\r\nvarious answers which run into three pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Member for Changi has touched on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  resettlement. He  complained  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  were not properly compensated and  even  said\r\n\r\nthat   a   resettlement  officer  actually   made   a\r\n\r\ncommitment on the amount of compensation to be  paid.\r\n\r\nIf  it was a verbal commitment, we are in no position\r\n\r\nto  say  whether  it is right or wrong.  But  let  me\r\n\r\nassure  him  that, as far as we are concerned,  there\r\n\r\ncan be no instance where, the actual compensation  is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  the  amount  originally   given   in\r\n\r\nwriting.  If the Member is convinced that  he  has  a\r\n\r\ncase, we would be prepared to investigate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also went on to complain about the\r\n\r\nunsympathetic, impatient and  high-handed  officials\r\n\r\nbullying  illiterate rural folks by  asking  them  to\r\n\r\nsign  documents hurriedly. Here again, I  can  merely\r\n\r\nreiterate   that  resettlement  officers  have   been\r\n\r\ninstructed - and if he wants I can send him circulars\r\n\r\nto  that  effect  -  to  provide  all  the  necessary\r\n\r\nexplanations  and  guidance  to  those  affected   by\r\n\r\nresettlement. Again, if the Member can  bring  to  my\r\n\r\nattention   any  specific  cases  of   rudeness   and\r\n\r\ndiscourtesy, we will be happy to investigate. I think\r\n\r\nthe Member should be happy with all these replies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new MP has also brought up the question of\r\n\r\ninadequate compensation Here again, if he could  bear\r\n\r\nwith  us  and look up the Hansard of the last  Budget\r\n\r\nsession, when we spent a lot of time explaining  the\r\n\r\nadequacy of the compensation. In fact, it touches  on\r\n\r\nthe resettlement of farmers who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  allocated land and resettlement in  housing  for\r\n\r\nfarmers  who  give  up their land  and  who  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed  to continue farming. So I would ask  him  to\r\n\r\nlook up the Hansard on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also went on to say that the Resettlement\r\n\r\nDepartment is very hardhearted and that they  do  not\r\n\r\ntake  into  consideration the livelihood of  affected\r\n\r\nelderly  farmers who have been working in  the  field\r\n\r\nfor  many  years. Here again, I can simply  say  that\r\n\r\nfarmers  who  qualify for land allocation  are  given\r\n\r\nalternative  land to continue their  livelihood.  But\r\n\r\nfor  those who do not opt for alternative land, they\r\n\r\nget enhanced compensation and a free flat, or cash in\r\n\r\nlieu is given. It is the present policy of the HDB to\r\n\r\nbuild  flats in the rural centres. These centres  are\r\n\r\nclose  to the farming areas where employment  can  be\r\n\r\nfound  in the larger farms which are, by the way, in\r\n\r\nshort  supply  of  farmers  or  workers.  Such  rural\r\n\r\ncentres  can be found in Jalan Kayu and Punggol.  But\r\n\r\nif  the  Member can justify that he has a really  big\r\n\r\nfarming  community in Changi, perhaps he can  let  us\r\n\r\nknow that he may need such facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised by the Member for Kampong Chai\r\n\r\nChee has again been answered by my Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> There is no answer yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Is the Member referring to a\r\n\r\nsingle  person  who is a citizen and is  affected  by\r\n\r\nresettlement and that he has to combine with  another\r\n\r\nsingle person to qualify for priority allocation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Well, in fact I have the answer\r\n\r\nhere.  There  are  a large number of  single  persons\r\n\r\naffected  by resettlement schemes and that  makes  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to suggest that they should  pair  up  for\r\n\r\nallocation of one-room HDB flats. Our experience  has\r\n\r\nshown  that  these single persons who seek  rehousing\r\n\r\nare  often  quite  old  and are without  children  or\r\n\r\nrelatives,  Most  of them merely  occupy  a  bunk  or\r\n\r\nsharing a cubicle or room with others It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore more humane and indeed practical to rehouse\r\n\r\nthem  with  other persons so as to provide them  with\r\n\r\nsome   form   of   companionship  and  respite   from\r\n\r\nloneliness and also an opportunity to share rent  and\r\n\r\nutility  expenses.  If  they  cannot,  then  the   MP\r\n\r\nconcerned  can always write to us and, on sympathetic\r\n\r\nand hardship grounds, consideration can be given.  As\r\n\r\nI have mentioned many times before, each case will be\r\n\r\nconsidered on its own merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's query on permanent residents affected\r\n\r\nby resettlement has been answered by my Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon has queried that in the\r\n\r\nrural  areas  the  orchid growers and  tropical  fish\r\n\r\nbreeders   affected  by  clearance  could  not   find\r\n\r\nalternative sites. In Singapore, available  land  for\r\n\r\nagriculture   is   unfortunately  limited.   Although\r\n\r\ntropical fish breeders and orchid growers are earners\r\n\r\nof  foreign exchange, priorities for alternative land\r\n\r\nis  accorded  to those agricultural activities  which\r\n\r\nproduce  food  such  as  pig, poultry  and  vegetable\r\n\r\ngrowing. The Primary Production Department has  found\r\n\r\nit  extremely difficult to provide alternative  sites\r\n\r\nfor  aquarium  fish  breeders due  to  their  special\r\n\r\nrequirements.  They  require sites  with  good  water\r\n\r\nsupply  and soil conditions which are able to  retain\r\n\r\nwater  for  proper  fish  breeding.  Such  areas  are\r\n\r\nextremely limited in Singapore and, if available, are\r\n\r\nnormally heavily encumbered with existing farms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to orchid growers, the Department is\r\n\r\ncurrently  making available the buffer zones  of  the\r\n\r\npig   farming   estates  at  Jalan   Kayu   for   the\r\n\r\nresettlement of viable orchid growers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mattar (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Ahmad Mattar):</b> May I make a point of clarification? On the\r\n\r\nquestion of old folks finding their own \"flat mates\",\r\n\r\nif  I  may  use the word, would it not be easier  for\r\n\r\nthem if the HDB, since the HDB knows who they are and\r\n\r\ntheir  whereabouts, could help them to look for \"flat\r\n\r\nmates\",  rather  than asking them to look  for  their\r\n\r\nmates themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the match-making role actually is being performed by the HDB.\r\n\r\nIf  the lonely old man seeks another old man, he  can\r\n\r\napproach the Area Office and ask them whether or  not\r\n\r\nthere  is  any other old man interested in sharing  a\r\n\r\nflat  with him. This is actually being done  all  the\r\n\r\ntime. I have promised the Leader of the House that  I\r\n\r\nwill finish my reply in half' an hour, and I think  I\r\n\r\ncan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied asked a question on the\r\n\r\npreservation  of old buildings. I think  this  is  an\r\n\r\nimportant observation. The Government is fully  aware\r\n\r\nof the need to retain buildings of a historical value\r\n\r\nand architectural merit to serve as a reminder of our\r\n\r\nhistory  and cultural heritage. Arising from this,  a\r\n\r\nPreservation  of Monuments Board was  established  in\r\n\r\n1971  to preserve monuments of historic, traditional,\r\n\r\narchaelogical,  architectural or artistic  interests.\r\n\r\nThe  primary task of the Board is to recommend to the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development the monuments to be\r\n\r\npreserved  and  placed under the  protection  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard.  Members of the Board come from  a  very  wide\r\n\r\nspectrum  of  our society and include representatives\r\n\r\nfrom   the  architecture  and  planning  disciplines,\r\n\r\ndevelopment   agencies,   cultural   and    religious\r\n\r\norganisations and the business community.  Since  its\r\n\r\ncreation  the Minister has, on the recommendation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Preservation of Monuments Board, gazetted  eight\r\n\r\nbuildings, among which are mosques, temples, churches\r\n\r\nand a medical institution for preservation. The Board\r\n\r\nis now looking into the preservation of entire street\r\n\r\nblocks, including some buildings in Chinatown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has brought up another point\r\n\r\non  the  Primary Production Department's  ability  to\r\n\r\nteach hydroponics for growing vegetables. This is not\r\n\r\na  new  comment, The House was informed of the  PPD's\r\n\r\nefforts to publicise the method of growing vegetables\r\n\r\nat  its  last sitting in November, 1976, just  before\r\n\r\nthe  Member was elected. Anyway, may I sum it  up  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that the results of the experiments conducted\r\n\r\nby the PPD on hydroponics have been widely publicised\r\n\r\nover the last two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  by the press, RTS and in publications such  as\r\n\r\nthe PPD Bulletin and the Singapore Journal of Primary\r\n\r\nIndustries.  On top of that, there is an  Agriculture\r\n\r\nHandbook  which is being sold to farmers and  members\r\n\r\nof the public at $2.50 per copy. The handbook gives a\r\n\r\nfull  account  of  the setting up of  the  commercial\r\n\r\nhydroponics  farm.  But if the Member's  constituents\r\n\r\nare  interested, the Department will be  prepared  to\r\n\r\norganise  classes  on hydroponics method  of  growing\r\n\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members brought up the question of the Urban\r\n\r\nand  Rural  Services Committee. Both the Members  for\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang  and  Nee Soon  complained  about  the\r\n\r\ninadequacy of the fund of the URSC and suggested that\r\n\r\nmore  money  should  be spent on the  rural  sectors.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  I could merely quote that out of the 1975/76\r\n\r\nbudget provision of $3,351,920, $2,351,920 have  been\r\n\r\nspent on the rural areas. This amounts to 70% of  the\r\n\r\nbudget for URSC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon suggested that perhaps\r\n\r\nbigger projects, such as roads costing over $100,000,\r\n\r\nbe  carried  out by PWD. If there is a  necessity  to\r\n\r\nbuild such sizable rural roads in the future, the PWD\r\n\r\ncould  look into it provided approval of funds  could\r\n\r\nbe  obtained  from the Ministry of Finance.  If  more\r\n\r\nsuch  rural  projects need to  be  done  and  can  be\r\n\r\njustified, perhaps a more practical approach would be\r\n\r\nto  request  the Ministry of Finance  to  allocate  a\r\n\r\nbigger  fund  for  the URSC. These proposals  can  be\r\n\r\nforwarded   to   the   Ministry   of   Finance    for\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol brought up the question of\r\n\r\nfarm  roads in Punggol. Here again, the main  purpose\r\n\r\nof  the farm roads in Punggol is obviously to provide\r\n\r\na  reasonable access to the farm holdings. These  are\r\n\r\nnot  meant to serve as trunk roads. Although they are\r\n\r\nsimilar  to  the standard rural road, they  are,  in\r\n\r\nfact, five feet wider. Unlike other laterite  roads,\r\n\r\nthese  farm  roads have been reinforced with  granite\r\n\r\ncrusher  run at additional cost. The total length  of\r\n\r\nthe  farm  roads  in Punggol farm  estates  is  about\r\n\r\n21,730 metres.

Because of the limited funds\r\n\r\nand  other claims and priority projects, it  will  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to metal and upgrade these roads  all  the\r\n\r\ntime, but perhaps progressively we can consider them.\r\n\r\nand  I  think my earlier answer that perhaps  getting\r\n\r\nmore funds for URSC is the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, there were comments from the Members for\r\n\r\nAljunied  and  Nee  Soon  on  sympathetic  or  proper\r\n\r\nconsideration  of  usage of acquired  property  after\r\n\r\nacquisition. The acquisition of land is, of course, a\r\n\r\nserious matter as it affects the livelihood of people\r\n\r\nwho are dislocated and required to resettle elsewhere\r\n\r\nFor  this  reason much care is taken to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nland is acquired only for redevelopment purposes. The\r\n\r\nexceptions  are cases where the lots remaining  after\r\n\r\nacquisition  are too small or isolated  and  are  not\r\n\r\nsuitable for independent development. In that case it\r\n\r\nwill  be  better  to acquire them  for  a  harmonious\r\n\r\nintegration  with  their  surroundings.  Of   course,\r\n\r\ndespite  these precautions it sometimes  happen  that\r\n\r\ndue   to   unforeseen  circumstances  or  change   in\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy  the envisaged development  cannot\r\n\r\ntake   place  Fortunately,  such  cases   are   rare.\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments and statutory boards  engaged\r\n\r\nin  land acquisition and development have the duty to\r\n\r\nensure that their acquisitions are planned with great\r\n\r\nconsideration  in order to prevent  such  cases  from\r\n\r\noccurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Nee Soon brought up the question of\r\n\r\nwidening  of  Sembawang Road Actually I have  already\r\n\r\ngiven  him  a  verbal reply just now  -  that  it  is\r\n\r\nactually  for a three-lane dual-carriageway and  that\r\n\r\nalthough  the  existing shops are not affected  there\r\n\r\nare drains to be constructed on the side of the three-lane  carriageway  and that the drain  and  the  road\r\n\r\nreserve would take up something like 20 feet  out  of\r\n\r\n60  feet  of the shop-houses.

Sir, in associating myself with\r\n\r\nall  my colleagues in thanking our President for  his\r\n\r\nSpeech  on behalf of the Government. I would like  to\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity to say a few  words  on  some\r\n\r\nlabour matters raised by hon. Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Kallang and Telok Blangah have\r\n\r\nsuggested that permanent residents should be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  be  employed  without having to  apply  for  work\r\n\r\npermits.  There  are  a number  of  reasons  why  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour continues to  require  permanent\r\n\r\nresidents  to apply for work permits. Firstly,  under\r\n\r\nthe  Regulation  of Employment Act,  all  non-citizen\r\n\r\nemployees  and  contract workers  earning  a  monthly\r\n\r\nsalary  of not more than $750 are required  to  apply\r\n\r\nfor  work permits. Secondly, it is felt that from the\r\n\r\nmanpower planning point of view, it is necessary  for\r\n\r\nus  to  know the number as well as the deployment  of\r\n\r\npermanent residents in the economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must assure hon. Members that usually permanent\r\n\r\nresidents do not face difficulties when applying  for\r\n\r\nwork  permit  for their employment, The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour adopts a very liberal policy when it comes  to\r\n\r\nissuing  work  permits  to  them.  Furthermore,  work\r\n\r\npermits  issued to permanent residents  are  for  two\r\n\r\nyears  instead  of the usual one year.  Hon.  Members\r\n\r\nwould recall also that in 1973 the Ministry of Labour\r\n\r\nmade  a  public announcement that permanent residents\r\n\r\nwho  pass  the appropriate skill test or who  possess\r\n\r\nacceptable  training qualifications will be  eligible\r\n\r\nfor   citizenship  if  they  satisfy   the   ten-year\r\n\r\nresidential qualification. Holders of Singapore  blue\r\n\r\nidentity  cards  who are unskilled  should  therefore\r\n\r\nstrive  to  upgrade  their skill  so  that  they  can\r\n\r\nqualify for citizenship under this scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Kallang has urged that serious\r\n\r\nattempts  be  made to find a solution to job  seekers\r\n\r\nwho are past retirement age. He has further suggested\r\n\r\nthat  certain  light jobs in the public  and  private\r\n\r\nsectors be reserved for those who are old but healthy\r\n\r\nenough to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, on a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.  In  my  speech.  I  mentioned   about\r\n\r\npermanent  residents who are stateless  persons,  and\r\n\r\nnot all permanent residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, it makes no difference even if\r\n\r\nhe  is stateless. He is not a Singapore citizen  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  according  to the  present  law,  a  work\r\n\r\npermit is required of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From CPF records, in the year 1974 there were 9,664\r\n\r\npersons who reached the age of 55; in 1975 there were\r\n\r\n12,820 persons and in 1976 there were 11,180 persons.\r\n\r\nYet  on the Labour Ministry's Employment Service live\r\n\r\nregister,  there  are only 480 such  people  who  are\r\n\r\nactively seeking employment, the majority of whom are\r\n\r\nunskilled.  Out of these 480 persons, 430 are  males.\r\n\r\nApparently,  older female workers are either  staying\r\n\r\nwith their families usefully engaged in helping their\r\n\r\nchildren in household duties or they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  no  difficulties in getting jobs. These figures\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  quite a number of these older  workers\r\n\r\neither  do  not  want  employment  or  do  not   need\r\n\r\nassistance in securing work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present in both the private and public sectors,\r\n\r\npersons  above  the  age  of 55  years  can  continue\r\n\r\ngainful employment. In the public sector, although 55\r\n\r\nyears  is the optional retirement age, those who  are\r\n\r\nin good health and choose to continue employment, can\r\n\r\ndo  so  up to the age of 60 years. Similarly  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector, collective agreements do provide  for\r\n\r\nemployment up to the age of 60 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation does not therefore warrant the\r\n\r\nintroduction of a scheme of reservation of  jobs  for\r\n\r\nthose who are old but healthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Potong Pasir has proposed a job\r\n\r\nquota  scheme  for the employment of  handicapped  or\r\n\r\ndisabled  persons.  Government,  together  with   the\r\n\r\nvoluntary agencies, have been actively promoting  the\r\n\r\nemployment of employable handicapped persons. In  the\r\n\r\njob placement efforts, both the Employment Service of\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Ministry and the Rehabilitation  Unit  of\r\n\r\nthe   Social   Welfare  Department  work   in   close\r\n\r\ncooperation  with  the voluntary bodies.  Within  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector, preference has already been given  to\r\n\r\nthe  employment  of  handicapped persons  in  certain\r\n\r\nsuitable   light   jobs  such  as   caretaker, lift\r\n\r\nattendant,  office  attendant, telephone   operator,\r\n\r\ntailor, typist and such like. In the private sector,\r\n\r\nthe  number of firms and factories willing to  employ\r\n\r\nhandicapped persons is increasing. A high  percentage\r\n\r\nof  disabled persons is being employed. Of the  4,603\r\n\r\nhandicapped persons in the working age group of  15-44 years,\r\n\r\n1,285 are currently in gainful employment.\r\n\r\n415   are  either  attending  schools  or  undergoing\r\n\r\nvocational  training geared to subsequent employment.\r\n\r\nOf   the  remaining  2,903,  477  are  incapable   of\r\n\r\nproductive work, that is, they are unemployed because\r\n\r\nof  severe disablement, 722 are not prepared to  seek\r\n\r\nwork  and  only  a  small number of  125  handicapped\r\n\r\npersons are actively seeking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwork  and  are  awaiting job placement.

Of course, not  all\r\n\r\naspects of the Western culture are bad. Some are good\r\n\r\nones and we have benefited from them and we intend to\r\n\r\nkeep  them even though they are alien to our society.\r\n\r\nMuch  of  the undesirable part of the western culture\r\n\r\nis transmitted to us through the media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both developed and developing societies, the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  the  printed  word  cannot  be  over-emphasized.  Although TV can stir  up  thinking  more\r\n\r\nquickly, it is a passing vision - it is seen, and  is\r\n\r\ngone.  So  is  sound broadcasting - it is  heard  and\r\n\r\ngone.  However, a newspaper exerts  a  more  lasting\r\n\r\nimpact.  It can be kept and re-read later  on.  Often\r\n\r\nits  pass-on circulation is such that its  impact  is\r\n\r\nunderstated  by  its \"official\" circulation  figures.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the newspaper is a powerful  instrument\r\n\r\nof public education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news media has acquired and wielded enormous\r\n\r\npower within the last two decades. In some countries,\r\n\r\nits  power sometimes exceeds that of the legislature,\r\n\r\nthe   judiciary  and  the  executive,   through   its\r\n\r\ninfluence  on public opinion. Its enormous power  can\r\n\r\nbe  harnessed  for the benefit of society.  It  could\r\n\r\nalso be manipulated to tear the society apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government in democratic countries are elected\r\n\r\nevery four or five years, and they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  therefore  be responsive to the societies  they\r\n\r\nserve.  This  is  not  so with the  press  as  it  is\r\n\r\naccountable  only to its owners. In large  societies,\r\n\r\nit  may  be  possible for newspapers with conflicting\r\n\r\nviews  and values to balance each other out, so  that\r\n\r\nno  single  newspaper  can  unduly  influence  public\r\n\r\nopinion. Even in these countries, it is socially  and\r\n\r\npolitically  undesirable for newspapers to  be  owned\r\n\r\nand  controlled  by one man, or one family,  as  this\r\n\r\nwould   make  it  difficult  for  the  press  to   be\r\n\r\nindependent  and impartial. In small countries  where\r\n\r\nthe  economy  or population can only sustain  two  or\r\n\r\nthree   major  newspapers, the  capacity  of   these\r\n\r\nnewspapers to manipulate public opinion would be  far\r\n\r\ngreater\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will  recall  what  happened  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Herald and the Eastern Sun. No  long  ago.\r\n\r\nefforts   were  made  by  certain  foreign  interests\r\n\r\nthrough  their local proxies to soften up the  ground\r\n\r\nfor  their  own insidious purposes, namely,  to  gain\r\n\r\nfootholds  in our society. Fortunately, their  plots\r\n\r\nwere nipped in the bud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, legislation exists to ensure that\r\n\r\nnewspapers do not function as mouthpieces of  outside\r\n\r\ninterests   to   propagate  alien  philosophies   and\r\n\r\nviewpoints  The Newspaper and Printing  Presses  Act.\r\n\r\n1974,  is  to ensure that public interests are  safe-guarded  by  requiring that newspapers become  public companies with Singapore citizens as directors. It is\r\n\r\nnot  intended  to  interfere with  newspapers  as  an\r\n\r\neconomic activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Act came into force on 1st January, 1975,\r\n\r\nthe danger of local newspapers falling into the hands\r\n\r\nof foreign interests has been lessened. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nthe  situation is still far from satisfactory, as the\r\n\r\nownership  of major newspapers remains with  a  small\r\n\r\ngroup of people In a small country like Singapore, it\r\n\r\nis  undesirable to allow any person or family to have\r\n\r\na  monopolistic  control of any major  newspaper.  In\r\n\r\nview  of  the  great influence the newspaper  has  on\r\n\r\nevery  individual's life as well as national  issues.\r\n\r\nit would be safer for their ownership to be spread as\r\n\r\nwidely as possible. It is equally important to have a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbalanced   representation  in   the   management   of\r\n\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In, order to break the monopolistic control of\r\n\r\nmajor  newspapers in Singapore by a  small  group  of\r\n\r\npeople, the Government is considering an amendment to\r\n\r\nthe  Newspaper  and Printing Presses  Act,  1974,  to\r\n\r\nprohibit  any person from holding either directly  or\r\n\r\nindirectly through a nominee or a holding company  or\r\n\r\nin  other  manner  more than 3% of  the  stock  of  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper,  without  the special  permission  of  the\r\n\r\nlicensing authority of the newspaper. Persons holding\r\n\r\nshares in excess of the permitted limit will have  to\r\n\r\ndispose of them through the Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed measures are not intended to be\r\n\r\nconfiscatory We do not seek more control than we have\r\n\r\nnow. We only seek to spread the ownership so that  it\r\n\r\nreaches the small people and more people will have  a\r\n\r\nsay in the ownership of the newspaper. These measures\r\n\r\nare  necessitated  by the need  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  are not merely solvent in the  accounting\r\n\r\nbalance sheet but also an asset in the balance  sheet\r\n\r\nof national well-being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think at this juncture it would be helpful if I\r\n\r\nwere to begin my reply to the hon. Member for Kampong\r\n\r\nChai  Chee  and the hon. Member for Katong  with  the\r\n\r\nanthropological  definition of  \"culture\"  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat we are talking about the same thing. Culture  as\r\n\r\nso  defined  is the sum total of the achievement  and\r\n\r\nactivities  of any specific period, race, or  people\r\n\r\nwhich     include,    inter    alia,    socioeconomic\r\n\r\ninstitutions,   music, art,   religious    beliefs.\r\n\r\ntraditions and language\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has inherited from the migrants who came\r\n\r\nto  settle  here from China, India and the  Malaysian\r\n\r\narchipelago their ancient cultures. To these has been\r\n\r\nadded  the culture derived from western civilization.\r\n\r\nSingapore  was  a British colony for over  a  hundred\r\n\r\nyears  and  we have inherited from the British  their\r\n\r\nsystem  of  law  and  the  Parliamentary  system   of\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that with such a sensitive issue as\r\n\r\nculture, the best way would be to let these inherited\r\n\r\ncultures develop within the Singapore context.  While\r\n\r\nestablishing cultural links with the past, we  should\r\n\r\nnot forget that we are Singaporeans. Thus, we have to\r\n\r\nbuild a cohesive, unified nation out of the disparate\r\n\r\nethnic groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evolution of a national cultural identity is.\r\n\r\ntherefore, part of the process of nation building. It\r\n\r\nis  a  task  which has been put into motion  some  20\r\n\r\nyears  ago through our education system, our national\r\n\r\nservice  programme, our community  centres  and,  not\r\n\r\nleast  of all, through the activities of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture  The  evolution of a  Singapore  cultural\r\n\r\nidentity  is  a long and time-consuming process.  Its\r\n\r\nform  cannot be laid down in advance because  culture\r\n\r\ncannot  be  subject to direction in the same  way  as\r\n\r\neconomic  development  It can only  be  nurtured  and\r\n\r\nencouraged in an atmosphere of freedom to experiment,\r\n\r\nchoose,  reject,  or adapt the various  elements  and\r\n\r\nforms that go to make up the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members in this House have expressed concern\r\n\r\nover  the  young with their high expectations,  their\r\n\r\npreference  for  soft jobs, and their  acceptance  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's prosperity as a norm and something  which\r\n\r\ncan  be  taken for granted. They have not experienced\r\n\r\nthe  hardships and sacrifices of their forebears.  If\r\n\r\nwe  accept that culture in its widest sense  means  a\r\n\r\nway  of  life rather than merely confining it to  the\r\n\r\npractice and appreciation of the fine arts, there are\r\n\r\ncertain  cultural norms and values common to all  the\r\n\r\nthree    major   streams   of   Asian   civilisations\r\n\r\nrepresented in our plural society The moral precepts,\r\n\r\npatriotism, filial piety and traditional values  such\r\n\r\nas  industry  and  thrift are still relevant  to  our\r\n\r\nsociety. These are the values our young must acquire.\r\n\r\nand these values can only be acquired by learning and\r\n\r\nappreciating our cultural heritage At the same  time,\r\n\r\nwe   must   not  overlook  the  fact  that   we   are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans Only when we realise this, are  we  then\r\n\r\nable  to  provide the cultural ballast for our  young\r\n\r\nthrough  the  evolution  of a  distinctive  Singapore\r\n\r\ncultural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nidentity  based  on the finest elements  in  our  own\r\n\r\ncultures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Singapore is heir to four great cultural\r\n\r\ncivilisations, it is thus given a rare  and  valuable\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  learn and absorb  the  best  in  all\r\n\r\nthese.  To deny or shut out any one of them would  be\r\n\r\nto  impoverish  and  endanger our rich  heritage  and\r\n\r\nnarrow   our  range  of  aesthetic  sensibility   and\r\n\r\nexperience.  We must be honest enough to  acknowledge\r\n\r\nthat  not  all our traditional values and  norms  are\r\n\r\ndesirable.  We  must, therefore, aim  to  achieve  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between  what is valuable  and  relevant  in\r\n\r\ntradition and what is required in a modern industrial\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An admirable element of western culture is the\r\n\r\nspirit   of   scientific  enquiry, of   seeking   to\r\n\r\nunderstand the laws of the universe, which has led to\r\n\r\nthe technological advances of the West. We must learn\r\n\r\nto  adapt to the imperatives of an industrial society\r\n\r\nwithout losing our cultural values. At the same time,\r\n\r\nwe  have to reject life styles and values of the West\r\n\r\nthat  are  alien  and  pernicious  to  our  Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety.  We must not allow permissiveness,  communal\r\n\r\nliving,  hippieism, drug taking, abhorrence for  hard\r\n\r\nwork  and urban violence to permeate our society.  To\r\n\r\nallow  these  undesirable elements  of  Western  life\r\n\r\nstyles  into  our  society  is  to  invite  ruin  and\r\n\r\ndisaster for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultural \"ballast\" implies a firm and sound rooting\r\n\r\nin  traditional  cultures, but since our  society  is\r\n\r\nlargely of migrant origin, these traditions have been\r\n\r\ninevitably weakened with time and distance. We should\r\n\r\nselect and retain those cultural elements that have a\r\n\r\nbroader  appeal  to all This would  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nyoung will not adopt those values and norms which are\r\n\r\nincompatible  with  our  national  aspirations.   The\r\n\r\nawareness  of  our  cultural past together  with  the\r\n\r\nforging of a distinctive Singapore identity will help\r\n\r\nprovide  our young with the necessary ballast against\r\n\r\nthe  inroads of undesirable western influence Without\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   cultural   identity, our   people\r\n\r\nespecially  the  young  are like  a  rudderless  ship\r\n\r\ndrifting with the wind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then we must not follow traditions blindly It is\r\n\r\ntrue that traditions and customs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nform  part of the culture of a people. There are good\r\n\r\ncustoms and there are bad ones Our duty is to try  to\r\n\r\npreserve and promote the good ones while at the  same\r\n\r\ntime keep down or do away with the bad ones. However,\r\n\r\nold  customs and traditions die hard and the task  to\r\n\r\neducate  the people and change their way of  thinking\r\n\r\nis  quite difficult. It may take years or generations\r\n\r\nto change. But change we must. In this world of rapid\r\n\r\nchanges  it  is  necessary that we should  adopt  the\r\n\r\npolicy of P'or chiu Iih hsin (destroying the old  and\r\n\r\nestablishing  the new order). But  in  doing  so,  we\r\n\r\nshould   be   careful  not  to  open   ourselves   to\r\n\r\naccusations  that we are ignorant  of  the  good  old\r\n\r\ncustoms, or worse still, we are trying to destroy the\r\n\r\nculture  of a people. Full explanation must be  given\r\n\r\nand  the  issue  should  be thrashed  out  thoroughly\r\n\r\nbefore  any action is taken. The people must be  made\r\n\r\nto  understand why certain actions have to  be  taken\r\n\r\neven  though some of them may not be happy with those\r\n\r\nactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way we handled cracker firing is a typical\r\n\r\nexample.   Cracker  firing  is  a  wasteful   custom.\r\n\r\nWhatever  merit  it may have in an  old  agricultural\r\n\r\nsociety, in the Singapore environment where more  and\r\n\r\nmore people are living in high-rise buildings, it has\r\n\r\nbecome really dangerous. It has got to go. But before\r\n\r\nimposing  a  total  ban  we  must  give  patient  and\r\n\r\nexhaustive  explanation. The  Chinese  philosophy  on\r\n\r\ngovernment  is  that  when  one  governs  one  seldom\r\n\r\nspeaks. Wei ch'erng pu tsai tuo yen. That was an  old\r\n\r\nauthoritarian way of government. But in our situation\r\n\r\nwhere   we   marry  oriental  society  with   western\r\n\r\ndemocracy, we  must not only govern effectively,  we\r\n\r\nmust  also explain convincingly. Therefore,  we  have\r\n\r\nsuggested  that instead of firing crackers everywhere\r\n\r\nand  disturbing  everyone, it should  be  allowed  in\r\n\r\ncontrolled areas, in designated places near community\r\n\r\ncentres, where the chances of people getting hurt are\r\n\r\nless.  We  have  tried every means  to  dissuade  the\r\n\r\npeople  from  this age-old custom. We have  even  run\r\n\r\nfilms  on cracker firing on TV, in the hope that  the\r\n\r\npeople will be satisfied with watching cracker firing\r\n\r\nand  hearing its noise on TV. All the while, we  knew\r\n\r\nfor certain that nothing short\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  a  total ban would solve the problem. And we also\r\n\r\nknew for sure that, to those diehards, no matter what\r\n\r\nwe  do they will not be satisfied. But then they knew\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  tried very hard to accommodate  their\r\n\r\nwishes.  In the end when the total ban came,  no  one\r\n\r\ncould  accuse  us  of  being an unresponsive  and  an\r\n\r\nuncaring  Government.  And, therefore,  we  can  have\r\n\r\nquieter  sleep  on Chinese New Year's  eve  not  only\r\n\r\nbecause there is less noise but also because we  know\r\n\r\nfor  certain  that  no  one can  make  this  into  an\r\n\r\nexplosive issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, had we taken the advice of the Member for\r\n\r\nKampong Chai Chee and imposed a total ban right  from\r\n\r\nthe   beginning   without  any   experimentation   or\r\n\r\nexplanation, we would have plunged headlong  into  a\r\n\r\ncrisis.  The  diehards  would be  angry,  the  common\r\n\r\npeople  would be confused and the Communists and  the\r\n\r\nanti-social elements would agitate. And  yet  we  are\r\n\r\nbeing  accused of being ignorant of our  culture  and\r\n\r\nlack  of  understanding. Sir, it is precisely because\r\n\r\nwe  know  too much and understand too much about  our\r\n\r\nown  culture and respect our own culture that we have\r\n\r\nto  resort to this so-called \"half-way house\" measure\r\n\r\nin   order  to  solve  this  delicate  problem  which\r\n\r\ninvolves a deep-rooted custom of the people. There is\r\n\r\nnothing  wrong in it. Democracy itself  is  a  system\r\n\r\nwhich  is  constantly devising a series of  \"half-way\r\n\r\nhouse\"  measures  to solve the delicate  problems  of\r\n\r\nsociety. When it comes to problems involving culture.\r\n\r\nlanguage and custom, they must be handled with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntolerance, patience and understanding. Sir, these are\r\n\r\nthe  finer points in the art of government and if the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Chai Chee aspires to step into our\r\n\r\nshoes he must learn them, and learn them fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for Kampong Chai\r\n\r\nChee  that  there is no such thing as the  cancelling\r\n\r\nout  game between the Ministry of Education  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture. We supplement each  other.  The\r\n\r\nonly cause for him to make the allegation is that  he\r\n\r\nsaw  a few commercial advertisements on TV not to his\r\n\r\nliking.  But  then everyone knows that TV commercials\r\n\r\ndo  not  represent Government policy.  My  Ministry's\r\n\r\nAddendum explicitly gave the priorities of our  radio\r\n\r\nand  television services, namely, to inform,  educate\r\n\r\nand entertain. Educational and information programmes\r\n\r\nacquired overseas and produced locally comprise  25%,\r\n\r\nthe largest category of TV output. This compares with\r\n\r\n23% for programmes which can be categorised as drama.\r\n\r\nand  9%  for  programmes which can be  classified  as\r\n\r\nmusic   or   musical  variety.  This  percentage   of\r\n\r\neducational and information programmes is  among  the\r\n\r\nhighest  in  this region for the public  broadcasting\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.
