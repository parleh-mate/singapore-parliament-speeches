The Police had  done\r\n\r\nall  they  could to determine how he got the drug by asking  his\r\n\r\ndoctors,  his  pharmacist  and the people  whom  he  could  have\r\n\r\nobtained the drugs from.   Unless the Member is able to give  us\r\n\r\nsome  lead as to where the late Mr Teh got his drug, I am afraid\r\n\r\nthat  we will be on a wild goose chase, as Mr Chiam had led  the\r\n\r\nHouse  and the Commission of Inquiry on a wild goose chase  many\r\n\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  do not know why Mr Jeyaretnam is interested in this question.\r\n\r\nI  think nobody, other than the person who gave Mr Teh that drug\r\n\r\nor  Mr  Teh  himself, would know where the drug came from.   And\r\n\r\neven  if  that person who gave him the drug were to own  up  and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"I  am  the  one who gave\", I do  not think  that  can  be\r\n\r\ncorroborated because Mr Teh is already dead.  So the only person\r\n\r\nwho  can  really tell where Mr Teh got his drug from is Mr  Teh.\r\n\r\nMaybe  for those who are really interested in finding out  where\r\n\r\nhe  got his drug from, I think that can be done one day when  we\r\n\r\nleave  this  world.

This  is to ensure that  in  the  case  of  any\r\n\r\naccident, we are able to limit the damage to the environment and\r\n\r\nthe  health threats to not just the general population,  but  to\r\n\r\npeople working in the immediate vicinity as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR THE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 1998 TO 31ST MARCH, 1999</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Paper Cmd. 3 of 1998)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [6th\r\n\r\nAllotted Day].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head U -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [17th March, 1998],\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head U of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $100. - [Mr Lew Syn Pau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not allow single persons to buy flats  directly\r\n\r\nfrom  HDB.   This is very unfair.  Although two single  citizens\r\n\r\nabove the age of 35 can buy flats directly from the HDB, to have\r\n\r\ntwo   unrelated  persons  buying  a  flat  and  living  together\r\n\r\nharmoniously  is a difficult task to accomplish.    Even  though\r\n\r\nthey jointly apply for a new flat, they would not be able to get\r\n\r\nthe  same  kind of subsidy granted by the Government   to  other\r\n\r\ncitizens.   If the argument against allowing a single person  to\r\n\r\nbuy  a new flat is that it may be wasteful for him to live in  a\r\n\r\nbig  flat  all  by himself, perhaps the HDB can restrict  single\r\n\r\npersons to buying only 2-room  or smaller flats.  I would appeal\r\n\r\nto  the Minister to allow single persons to individually  buy  a\r\n\r\nflat  directly  from  HDB, and to give them  the  same  kind  of\r\n\r\nsubsidy enjoyed by other citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I join Dr\r\n\r\nKer  in making the same plea, because, presently, singles do not\r\n\r\nenjoy  subsidised public housing unless they  are  aged  35  and\r\n\r\nabove.   They would then qualify for new flats under  the  Joint\r\n\r\nSingles  Scheme.   Singles  do not find  the  current  situation\r\n\r\nequitable  and feel that they are discriminated against  in  the\r\n\r\ndistribution of subsidies to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Straits Times' survey on 26th September 1997 on the\r\n\r\nattitudes  of  Singaporeans  to  public  housing,  76%  of   the\r\n\r\nrespondents believe that the Government should provide subsidies\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsingles  to help them own HDB flats.  Based on the 1995  general\r\n\r\nhousehold  survey,  the number of single residents  in  the  age\r\n\r\ngroup  between 30 and 49 has increased from 69,000 or 3% of  the\r\n\r\npopulation in 1980 to 184,000 or 6% of the population  in  1995.\r\n\r\nIn other words, in 15 years, it has doubled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an aside, I would like to humbly point out that the\r\n\r\nNominated MP, Madam Claire Chiang, in an earlier speech in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I believe, in the motion on tripartism moved by  NMP  Mr\r\n\r\nCyrille  Tan, said and I quote, \"The 1990 Census Report reported\r\n\r\nthat  single parent family households comprise 60,999 households\r\n\r\nwith   widowed  parents  and  17,585  households  with  divorced\r\n\r\nparents,  representing  approximately 10%  of  all  family-based\r\n\r\nhouseholds.\"  Again, to put statistics into perspective, I would\r\n\r\nlike to humbly point out that according to the Census Report  of\r\n\r\n1990,  the  number of heads of households who were  widowed  and\r\n\r\ndivorced totalled 78,584 or 11.9% of total households.   Out  of\r\n\r\nthese, 60,999 heads of households were widowed or about 9.2%  of\r\n\r\ntotal households were thus single parent family households  with\r\n\r\nwidowed  parents, as stated by Madam Chiang in her  speech.   In\r\n\r\nthe same Census Report, there were 17,585 heads of households or\r\n\r\n2.7%  of  total  households who are divorced and not  households\r\n\r\nwith divorced parents, to quote Mdm Chiang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhow, Sir, I join Mdm Chiang and Dr Ker to make this plea\r\n\r\nto  Government  to  review  this  policy  for  singles  as  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are affected find themselves disadvantaged.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>\r\n\r\nSir,  first let me thank Members for raising several  issues  on\r\n\r\npublic  housing policies.  Let me take first Mr Zainul  Abidin's\r\n\r\nrequest for a report of the effectiveness of last year's  policy\r\n\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public housing situation is now stabilized. As at end\r\n\r\nFebruary  1998,  there were 128,800 applicants  on  the  waiting\r\n\r\nlist.   Of  these,  60,800  are  first-timers  and  68,000   are\r\n\r\nupgraders.  Compared to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary last year, we had 141,000 applicants.  So the situation\r\n\r\ntoday  is  better than last year.  The new applications received\r\n\r\nby  HDB are now more sustainable.  HDB now receives about  1,000\r\n\r\nto 1,500 applications per month.  This trend, if sustained, will\r\n\r\nbring  the  annual demand for new HDB flats to a more  realistic\r\n\r\nlevel of about 20,000 per year compared with the 67,000 that  we\r\n\r\nreceived in 1996.  The number of applications under the  fiance-fiancee  scheme has also dropped to a more realistic  figure  of\r\n\r\n500 a month, about half the monthly figures that we received  in\r\n\r\n1996.  There were also more first time applicants than upgraders\r\n\r\nrecently.   This  should  be the case as first-timer  applicants\r\n\r\nshould  be  and are given higher priority in owning their  first\r\n\r\nflats.  The revised policies have led to an overall reduction in\r\n\r\nthe  waiting time for new HDB flats.  First-timer applicants for\r\n\r\n4-room and 5-room flats in the north and west zones will now  be\r\n\r\nable to book a flat in approximately 2 years, those in the north-east  zone  within  3 years, and those in the Punggol  21  queue\r\n\r\nslightly  over 3 years.  Upgrader applicants in all  zones  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  wait  longer for their flats, about 3 1/2 years  for  the\r\n\r\nnorth and west zones, about 4 years for the north-east zone, and\r\n\r\nmore  than  5  years for the Punggol 21 estate.  Applicants  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to transfer their applications to another flat type  or\r\n\r\nzone and their applications will be set back by three months  on\r\n\r\nthe queue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised resale levy imposed in 1997 has also\r\n\r\ndiscouraged frivolous demand from upgraders whose existing flats\r\n\r\nare  already  able to meet their existing needs.  Prior  to  May\r\n\r\n1997,  there were about 300 new applications received per  month\r\n\r\nfrom  upgraders who were already existing lessees or  ex-lessees\r\n\r\nof  5-room flats or bigger.  This number has now dropped  to  an\r\n\r\naverage  of  22  per  month.   The  vast  majority  of  upgrader\r\n\r\napplications  now are applicants from 4-room or  smaller  flats.\r\n\r\nThese  applicants are our target group for upgrading to a second\r\n\r\nflat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the measures have achieved what we set out to do. HDB\r\n\r\nis building 35,000 flats in 1998, 27,000 for first-timers and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8,000  for  upgraders.   The waiting time for  first-timers  has\r\n\r\nshortened.   We  have weeded out the more frivolous  demand.   I\r\n\r\nwould  therefore say the overall impact of the 1997 revision  in\r\n\r\nthe policies has been positive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the resale market for HDB flats as a\r\n\r\nbackdrop  to  our subsequent discussion.  Resale prices  of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats showed huge increases from 1993 to 1996.  In May 1996, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  introduced  measures  to  curb  speculation  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  residential property market.  With  the  correction  in\r\n\r\nprices  for  the private residential properties it is inevitable\r\n\r\nthat HDB resale prices will also follow suit, especially for the\r\n\r\ntop-end of the HDB resale market.  A correction of prices at the\r\n\r\ntop-end  of  the  market will subsequently filter  down  to  the\r\n\r\nsmaller HDB flats.  The 1997 HDB policy changes also curbed  the\r\n\r\nspeculative  demand for HDB flats brought about by  easy  credit\r\n\r\npolicy  for  HDB  mortgage loans.  This correction  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nresale  prices is not unwelcomed, considering the huge  increase\r\n\r\nin  prices  from 1993 to 1996.  The correction has  made  resale\r\n\r\nflats  more affordable.  Upgraders who need  extra living  space\r\n\r\nor  who want a  flat fast can now consider buying flats from the\r\n\r\nresale market.  For first-timers, they are assisted by a $40,000\r\n\r\nCPF  housing  grant  or $50,000 grant if they  live  near  their\r\n\r\nparents.   More  and  more first-timers are taking  up  the  CPF\r\n\r\nhousing grant to buy a resale flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to pricing and affordability. Several\r\n\r\nMembers  have  expressed concern that in  the  current  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn  some  HDB flat owners may not be able  to  afford  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  or  they  may face difficulties paying for  the  mortgage\r\n\r\nloans.  I would like to reaffirm the Government's commitment  to\r\n\r\nprovide   affordable  public  housing  to  Singapore   citizens,\r\n\r\nespecially first-timers and families in the lower income groups.\r\n\r\nAs  I have said several times, the Government's commitment is to\r\n\r\nprice new HDB flats such that 90% of Singaporean households will\r\n\r\nbe  able to afford at least a 3-room flat and 70% at least a  4-room  flat.  This policy has not changed.  In general, HDB flats\r\n\r\nare  priced  such that purchasers are able to pay their  monthly\r\n\r\nloan instalments  within\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  30%  limit of their monthly CPF contributions which can  be\r\n\r\nused  to  pay  for  their housing.  The cash  outlay  that  flat\r\n\r\napplicants  have  to  take out from their disposable  income  is\r\n\r\nminimal.  HDB records show that in 1997 the average monthly loan\r\n\r\ninstalment constituted around 25% to 30% of the gross  household\r\n\r\nincome of the purchasers.  Also, 80% of purchasers were able  to\r\n\r\nservice  their monthly household loans entirely from  their  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.   This proportion is very high  considering  that\r\n\r\nsome purchasers are self-employed with no CPF contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further proof that HDB flats are affordable is evident in\r\n\r\nthe very low loan default rate.  Last year, HDB recovered only 5\r\n\r\nflats  out  of  430,000  flat owners with  outstanding  mortgage\r\n\r\nloans,  arising from the purchasers' inability to service  their\r\n\r\nmonthly  loan  payments.  To make sure  that  HDB  flats  remain\r\n\r\naffordable   to  Singaporeans  even  in  the  current   economic\r\n\r\nconditions,  we  will monitor the affordability indicators  very\r\n\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin has raised concern about Government\r\n\r\nhelping  low  income  families own their flats.   I  can  assure\r\n\r\nMembers  that MND would keep its eye on the ball and  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  low  income  families continue to be able  to  afford  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.  In 1994, we announced four policies to allow them to  do\r\n\r\nso:   (i)  the  sale  of rental flats to sitting  tenants  at  a\r\n\r\ndiscount;   (ii)  sale of 3-room flats purchased by HDB from the\r\n\r\nopen  market  and then sold to applicants, also at  a  discount;\r\n\r\n(iii)   sale  of  smaller 4-room HDB flats;  and  (iv)  priority\r\n\r\nallocation  of  3- and 4-room flats to HDB rental flat  tenants.\r\n\r\nThese  policies have been very successful and later  on  I  will\r\n\r\nannounce an extension of this programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min asked about applicants or buyers who may\r\n\r\nhave lost their jobs in the current economic turmoil and how HDB\r\n\r\ncan help them service their loans.  HDB has several measures  to\r\n\r\nallow home buyers to reschedule their mortgage loans.  First  of\r\n\r\nall,  we  allow  them  to  pay  the  mortgage  loan  arrears  by\r\n\r\ninstalments within a reasonable period.  Secondly, we allow them\r\n\r\nto reschedule\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  loans  up to the maximum repayment period that  they  are\r\n\r\neligible for.  Thirdly, we also allow those in hardship to defer\r\n\r\npayments  of the loan instalments for an initial period  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths,  and  with a further extension of six  months  if  their\r\n\r\ntemporary difficulties continue.  Fourthly, we can also  convert\r\n\r\ntheir  loan  scheme  to an easy repayment  scheme.   Under  this\r\n\r\nscheme,  the monthly instalment for the first five years  is  at\r\n\r\n75%  of  the  normal instalment amount.  It is  then  recomputed\r\n\r\nfrom  the  6th year onwards to the end of the repayment  period,\r\n\r\nbased on the outstanding loan on the 6th year.  Finally, we also\r\n\r\nencourage  the inclusion of a working family member as  a  joint\r\n\r\nowner  so that the CPF monies of the new lessee can be  used  to\r\n\r\npay for the arrears.  Sir, I want to assure Mr Ong Kian Min that\r\n\r\nHDB would resort to recovering the flat due to loan default only\r\n\r\nas a last resort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked about applicants who may want to change\r\n\r\nto  a smaller flat because of their difficulties.  If applicants\r\n\r\nare  unable  to  afford the flats they have  booked  because  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties, they can apply to HDB to  cancel  their\r\n\r\napplications or change their applications to smaller flats.   On\r\n\r\na  case-by-case  basis,   depending on their circumstances,  HDB\r\n\r\nwill consider waiving the penalty fees for the cancellation  and\r\n\r\nalso the 3-month setback for the change of flat type.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen has asked whether more first-timers are now\r\n\r\napplying for 5-room flats rather than smaller units and  whether\r\n\r\nwe  should have some criteria to make sure they can afford to do\r\n\r\nso.   As you all know, HDB has already implemented policies such\r\n\r\nas  credit assessment to ensure that applicants buy flats within\r\n\r\ntheir affordability.  The amount of loan HDB grants also depends\r\n\r\non  their  age and household income and is capped such that  the\r\n\r\nmonthly  instalments  do not exceed 40%  of  the  buyer's  gross\r\n\r\nmonthly  income.   With  these conditions  in  place,  there  is\r\n\r\ntherefore no need to impose further criteria for applicants of 5-room flats.  We hope, and we encourage, all Singaporeans to  buy\r\n\r\nwithin their means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the issue of housing subsidies. The\r\n\r\nreason why HDB flats are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naffordable  is  because  they  are  heavily  subsidized.    This\r\n\r\nquestion  of  public housing subsidy is a long-standing  debate.\r\n\r\nIt  started in 1984 between Mr Chiam and the late Mr Teh  Cheang\r\n\r\r\nWan  and  continued  in 1988-1989 between  Mr  Chiam  and  Mr  S\r\n\r\nDhanabalan.  I assume Mr Chiam now understands housing  policies\r\n\r\nand therefore we do not hear very much about this from him.  But\r\n\r\nnow  we  get a new \"Chiam\".  Mr Low Thia Khiang wants  to  raise\r\n\r\nthis debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most direct and the clearest manifestation of housing\r\n\r\nsubsidy  is  the  CPF housing grant of $40,000  for  first-timer\r\n\r\ncouples  to buy a resale flat.  This is the most direct subsidy.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if the first-timer couple buys a resale flat within\r\n\r\n2  km  from  their  parent's flat they enjoy a higher  grant  of\r\n\r\n$50,000.  In FY96, 4,692 first-timer families made use  of  this\r\n\r\ngrant.   A total of $203 million was disbursed.  In FY97,  based\r\n\r\non  current projection, the disbursement of CPF housing grant is\r\n\r\nestimated  to  go up to $223 million.  This is the  most  direct\r\n\r\nform of housing subsidy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of this CPF grant concept is the 3-room buy-back scheme. Here, HDB buys 3-room flats from the open market,\r\n\r\npays  the  going  market  price and  then  sells  the  flats  to\r\n\r\napplicants on the 3-room flat waiting list at a discount  of  up\r\n\r\nto  $50,000.   That  is  again a very  direct  form  of  housing\r\n\r\nsubsidy.  Since the scheme started in 1994, HDB has bought  more\r\n\r\nthan  7,500  3-room flats.  The subsidy involved in this  scheme\r\n\r\namounts to about $375 million over the three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to new HDB flats. There are 128,000\r\n\r\napplicants  on the queue.  Why is that so?  Because the  subsidy\r\n\r\nis  greater for those waiting for new flats than the $40,000  or\r\n\r\n$50,000  CPF  grant.  If the subsidy is less, then why  wait  so\r\n\r\nlong in the queue?  The Government's approach to pricing of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats and housing subsidy is very clear.  I have explained  this\r\n\r\nmany times.  Let me reiterate the principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will subsidise the smaller flats more than the\r\n\r\nbigger flats.  Second, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  subsidise  the less popular areas more  than  the  popular\r\n\r\nareas.   Mr  Low  Thia Khiang said that HDB made  a  development\r\n\r\nprofit  in the Sengkang contracts.  This is no great revelation.\r\n\r\nI  supplied  those  figures last month.  For the  bigger  flats,\r\n\r\nespecially  the design-and-build flats in Sengkang, HDB  made  a\r\n\r\ndevelopment profit.  In the Woodlands and Jurong West contracts,\r\n\r\nhowever,  HDB  made  a development loss.  Overall,  HDB  made  a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  loss  of  $280 million in 1997.   If  there  is  no\r\n\r\nsubsidy,  then  why  do we still have 40,000 applicants  in  the\r\n\r\nNorth-east queue waiting for flats in Sengkang Town?  The reason\r\n\r\nis  very  simple.  Because the average market subsidy of  a  new\r\n\r\nflat in Sengkang Town in 1997 was $103,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang gave these numbers, which were supplied\r\n\r\nin  February.  I hope he would take these numbers and  publicise\r\n\r\nthem  in  The Hammer.  Publicise these numbers widely, tell  all\r\n\r\nthe  Workers'  Party  supporters  that  the  Government  made  a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  profit in Sengkang and that therefore  they  should\r\n\r\nwithdraw  from the North-east queue.  We have 40,000  applicants\r\n\r\nin  the  North-east  queue.  I assume  the  Workers'  Party  can\r\n\r\ncommand  10-20% of support from Singaporeans.  So I  shall  look\r\n\r\nforward  to  perhaps 4,000 to 8,000 of Workers' Party supporters\r\n\r\nlistening  to  Mr Low Thia Khiang, knowing that  the  Government\r\n\r\nmade  a  profit  and,  therefore, withdraw from  the  North-east\r\n\r\nqueue.  If that happens, I will buy Mr Low a very good lunch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

There are 1,400 constituents in Hougang\r\n\r\nConstituency who are on the North-east queue.  HDB can provide a\r\n\r\ndirect mailing list to these 1,400 applicants, tell them that Mr\r\n\r\nLow  says  that  Sengkang  flats are not  subsidised,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment made a development profit and, therefore, they should\r\n\r\nwithdraw from the queue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are not stupid! They know whether there is a\r\n\r\nsubsidy  in HDB flats or not.  Mr S. Dhanabalan took some  pains\r\n\r\nto explain the concept of market subsidy to Mr Chiam.  I hope Mr\r\n\r\nChiam now understands the meaning of a market subsidy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of market subsidy is nothing new. It is\r\n\r\npractised in Hong Kong.  It is a very complicated system in Hong\r\n\r\nKong.   Let  me just explain the gist of it.  In Hong Kong,  the\r\n\r\nHong  Kong  Housing  Authority sells a flat  to  the  Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nresident  at  a  price.  When they sell the flat, they  estimate\r\n\r\nwhat  is the market price of the flat that they are selling and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, what is the price that they are selling, the discount\r\n\r\nof the flat that they are selling, compared to the market price.\r\n\r\nSo if they sell a flat at, say, 35% discount of the market price\r\n\r\n-  the market price is compared to the private property in  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  - that 35% discount is levied when the Hong Kong residents\r\n\r\nsell  their flats 10 years later.  So when the Hong Kong Housing\r\n\r\nAuthority sells you a flat, they tell you that this price is  at\r\n\r\n35%  discount of the market price.  You are not allowed to  sell\r\n\r\nyour  flat  until 10 years later.  When you sell  your  flat  10\r\n\r\nyears later, they levy 35% on the market price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we do not do such a thing. We allow you to\r\n\r\nsell your first flat and you do not pay a levy.  You only pay  a\r\n\r\nlevy  if you re-enter for a second flat.  We also allow  you  to\r\n\r\nsell  after  five years, not after 10 years.  And when  we  talk\r\n\r\nabout market subsidy in Singapore, we are comparing the price of\r\n\r\nHDB  flats to the resale HDB price, not to the private  property\r\n\r\nas in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what does this all add up to? In the latest HDB's\r\n\r\naudited  accounts  for  FY96, the  deficit  for  sale  of  flats\r\n\r\namounted  to $1 billion.  This comprises the development  losses\r\n\r\nthat HDB incurred from the sale of new HDB flats as well as  the\r\n\r\nmarket  discount  for  the sale of 3-room  flats  to  low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies.  For FY97, the accounts are not audited yet,  but  HDB\r\n\r\nexpects to incur a deficit of about $600 million for its sale of\r\n\r\nflats  activity.  As I said earlier, HDB incurred a  development\r\n\r\nloss of about $280 million in 1997.  HDB\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincurred $100 million in the buy-back of 3-room flats, and there\r\n\r\nis  another $200 million of subsidies in CPF grants.  All  these\r\n\r\nnumbers have been published in HDB's accounts since 1985.  There\r\n\r\nis  no great revelation in what Mr Low said yesterday.  In fact,\r\n\r\nas  I  have  offered,  we will be happy if he  publicises  these\r\n\r\nfigures  and encourages the people to withdraw from the Sengkang\r\n\r\nqueue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to CPF grant for the singles. This is an\r\n\r\nappeal  made several times by MPs in this House.  I am happy  to\r\n\r\nannounce  that,  with effect from 1st June 1998, the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  extend the CPF Housing Grant Scheme to single citizens  to\r\n\r\nhelp them purchase HDB resale flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single citizens who purchase a resale flat under this\r\n\r\nscheme  will get a grant of $15,000.  Joint singles who purchase\r\n\r\na resale flat under the Joint Singles Scheme will get a grant of\r\n\r\n$30,000.  Why $15,000?  We feel that the singles should not have\r\n\r\nthe  same  amount of grant as the first-timer couple.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe grant should be less than half, and therefore we have pegged\r\n\r\nit at $15,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say that with effect from 1st June 1998,\r\n\r\nsingles  can  only  purchase HDB flats from the  resale  market,\r\n\r\neither  under  the Singles Scheme or the Joint  Singles  Scheme.\r\n\r\nThey  can no longer purchase a flat directly from HDB.  So those\r\n\r\nwho  are  on  the queue now, under the Joint Singles Scheme,  to\r\n\r\npurchase flats directly from HDB, we will keep that queue.   But\r\n\r\nfrom  today,  HDB will not take anymore applications  under  the\r\n\r\nJoint Singles Scheme for direct HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that so? Because with this grant, we would like\r\n\r\nsingles to now purchase flats from the resale market and not add\r\n\r\nto  HDB  queue.  In addition, we have been noticing a  trend  of\r\n\r\nsingles  incorporating  single  elderly  in  the  Joint  Singles\r\n\r\napplication.  We think this is an abuse of the system because  a\r\n\r\nsingle would bring in another elderly single, a grandaunt  or  a\r\n\r\nrelative,  but there is no intention at all that the  two  would\r\n\r\nstay  together.  They would get a new flat and the single  would\r\n\r\nthen  stay  in  that flat on her own.  So we  are  stopping  the\r\n\r\nScheme as of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to upgrading. The Main Upgrading Programme\r\n\r\nwas  introduced  in  1990.  Since then,  we  have  announced  12\r\n\r\nbatches,  comprising 73,000 flats.  The IUP  now  involves  more\r\n\r\nthan  100,000 flats.  In other words, almost one in every  three\r\n\r\nHDB flats has undergone or is undergoing some form of upgrading,\r\n\r\neither  under the MUP or IUP.  This is a very massive programme.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a  key  programme to share the wealth with Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nWith  this current economic slowdown, there is a need to  review\r\n\r\nthe  MUP  and  IUP  schedules.  As we have  announced,  the  MUP\r\n\r\nschedule will be slowed down from 15 precincts last year  to  10\r\n\r\nprecincts  this year.  When the economy recovers, we  will  then\r\n\r\nbring the programme back to its original scale.  Similarly,  the\r\n\r\nIUP programme will be scaled down to between 16 and 20 precincts\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Mr Ong Kian Min for his support of this slowdown,\r\n\r\nbut  not  the  reasons for his support.  Mr  Ong  supported  the\r\n\r\nslowdown  because he said that the cost-sharing is a  burden  to\r\n\r\nthe HDB lessees who participate in this programme.  I can assure\r\n\r\nMembers  that  this  is  not  so.  First  of  all,  lessees  who\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  the  MUP programme do not  have  to  pay  their\r\n\r\nportion of the cost-sharing in a one-off payment.  They can take\r\n\r\na loan.  If they cannot afford the loan, we can keep in view the\r\n\r\nloan  until  they  sell  the flat.   So  it  is  not  true  that\r\n\r\nparticipating in the MUP is a financial burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau asked whether we could reschedule or\r\n\r\nreorganise the MUP programme so that it would not take so  long.\r\n\r\nHDB  has  worked out this arrangement in the best way of  saving\r\n\r\ncost  and  a  smooth flow of work.  But I leave it to individual\r\n\r\nMPs  and their architects and consultants.  If they want to call\r\n\r\na tender with a different way of organising their MUP programme,\r\n\r\nthey  are free to do so.  The only requirement is - do not  bust\r\n\r\nthe budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked for upgrading of 1-room and 2-room\r\n\r\nflats.   He  gave  the  impression that  the  MUP  programme  is\r\n\r\ntargeted at 3-room flats and above and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  1-  and  2-room  flats have  been  left  out  of  the\r\n\r\nprogramme.   That  is  not  so.   Under  the  MUP  and  the  IUP\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  the  1- and 2-room flats which  form  part  of  the\r\n\r\nprecinct  will  similarly be upgraded.  And if they  are  rental\r\n\r\nflats, the HDB pays for all the costs.  So far, 10,000 of such 1- and  2-room flats have been selected for the MUP.  Another 3,800\r\n\r\nhave  been  selected for the IUP.  Upon completion of  the  MUP,\r\n\r\nsome of the 2-room flats will be sold to the sitting tenants  at\r\n\r\na discount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, HDB has a programme to upgrade 1-room\r\n\r\nflats, to improve the living conditions of the elderly living in\r\n\r\nthese 1-room flats.  I have explained this several times.  Since\r\n\r\n1993,  we have upgraded 1-room rental blocks and, together  with\r\n\r\nthe  VWOs,  we will then provide services to the elderly.   This\r\n\r\nprogramme  has been very successful.  The project is  now  being\r\n\r\nimplemented for 25 1-room rental blocks, comprising 7,800 units.\r\n\r\nSo the elderly living in these units will benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also take this opportunity to announce that HDB will\r\n\r\nundertake  an  Ad  Hoc  Upgrading Programme  for  2-room  rental\r\n\r\nblocks.  As  I have said earlier, when the 2-room rental  blocks\r\n\r\nare  upgraded  under the MUP, we will sell them to  the  sitting\r\n\r\ntenants  at  a discount, after the upgrading is completed.   HDB\r\n\r\nhas  identified 54 blocks of rental flats that are suitable  for\r\n\r\nsale  to  sitting tenants.  So far, 18 of these 54  blocks  have\r\n\r\nbeen  included for upgrading under the MUP.  Another  22  blocks\r\n\r\nare  within  the  MUP  age band and will  be  grouped  with  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring blocks for MUP upgrading over the next  few  years.\r\n\r\nWe therefore have the remaining 14 blocks which fall outside the\r\n\r\nMUP  age  band.  Under normal circumstances, it will be  several\r\n\r\nyears before we can upgrade these units and sell them to sitting\r\n\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are taking this opportunity to undertake an Ad Hoc\r\n\r\nProgramme  to upgrade these 14 blocks in four batches,  starting\r\n\r\nfrom  the third quarter this year and the whole programme should\r\n\r\nbe  finished by the year 2002.  When we have upgraded the units,\r\n\r\nwe  will then sell them to the sitting tenants.  So this is  one\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextensions of the programme to allow low income families to  buy\r\n\r\nflats even during this economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the IUP programme. Several Members have\r\n\r\nraised  this issue about lift upgrading.  Let me just  say  that\r\n\r\neven  within  the budget of $6,000 per unit, some town  councils\r\n\r\nwere able to implement lift upgrading.  Nevertheless, last year,\r\n\r\nwe  increased  the  budget to $7,000 so as  to  facilitate  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading  during the MUP.  In response to the appeals  made  by\r\n\r\nMembers in this House, the Government will now raise the  budget\r\n\r\nfor  IUP  to $8,000 per unit for the next batch of IUP, provided\r\n\r\nyou  undertake  lift  upgrading.  If you do not  undertake  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading, then the budget is cut back to $5,000.  Then  Members\r\n\r\nwill be able to implement what they have been saying all along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about lifts in private housing estates. Under\r\n\r\nthe  Land  Titles  (Strata) Act, the management  corporation  is\r\n\r\nallowed to collect service and conservancy charges and set aside\r\n\r\na  portion of these charges as sinking fund for the upgrading of\r\n\r\nlifts.   If  the sinking fund is not sufficient, the  management\r\n\r\ncorporation can pass a resolution at the general meeting to levy\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  lift replacement from the owners of  the  private\r\n\r\nhousing  estate.   Therefore, we encourage the  owners  and  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  corporations to plan in advance  for  such  cyclical\r\n\r\nupgrading works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered most of the queries raised. I\r\n\r\nwould be prepared to respond if I have left out anything.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Can I confirm with the\r\n\r\nMinister that (1) there is no Government subsidy for the new HDB\r\n\r\nflats  in  Sengkang?  (2) Does the Government  make  development\r\n\r\nprofits  from  the  sale of these flats  in  Sengkang?   Another\r\n\r\nclarification is: would the selling price of new HDB flats,  let\r\n\r\nus say, in the north zone, be increased if more applicants apply\r\n\r\nfor flats in the zone?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Can I clarify also?

The concept of market subsidy ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I am talking about subsidy, not market\r\n\r\nsubsidy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I am telling you the concept of market\r\n\r\nsubsidy  is what the commodity will be priced in the market  and\r\n\r\nwhat  you are paying for it.  Singaporeans are not that  stupid.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will gain no pleasure at all if  HDB,  instead  of\r\n\r\nmaking  a  development loss of $280 million, makes a development\r\n\r\nloss  of  $2,800 million because of inefficiency.   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare not interested in what HDB makes or loses.  When they buy  a\r\n\r\nflat, they are interested in the value of the flat in the market\r\n\r\nand  what  they  are  paying for it.  And  that  is  the  market\r\n\r\nsubsidy.   And  as I have explained, the market  subsidy  for  a\r\n\r\nSengkang flat is $103,000.  That is why we have more than 40,000\r\n\r\napplicants in the queue.  For development contracts in Sengkang,\r\n\r\nin   some  contracts,  we  made  a  development  gain,  in  some\r\n\r\ncontracts,  we  made a development loss.  In a  design-and-build\r\n\r\ncontract, we price them higher because they cost more and  there\r\n\r\nare  extra design features.  There is a bigger development gain.\r\n\r\nOverall,  for  1997, HDB made a total development loss  of  $280\r\n\r\nmillion.  And as I have said, the Government's intention  is  to\r\n\r\nsubsidise the smaller flats and the less popular estates more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the development cost per unit, maybe I need another\r\n\r\ntutorial  on  arithmetic  101.   HDB  publishes  in  its  annual\r\n\r\naccounts  the development cost of the flats it sells.   It  also\r\n\r\npublishes  the number of units it sells.  If you take  the  two,\r\n\r\nyou  get  the  development cost per unit.  That is  not  a  very\r\n\r\nmeaningful figure because the development cost per unit, if  you\r\n\r\nget  an  average  figure like that, it averages the  development\r\n\r\ncost  of  a 4-room flat to an Executive flat from mature estates\r\n\r\nto  new  town.   So I do not see the gain in HDB publishing  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  cost per unit.  But if you want that  number,  just\r\n\r\ntake the two figures in the Annual Report and divide it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I do not think this is economics 101.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a question of subsidy of HDB flats which is a big  issue\r\n\r\nand in fact very complicated.  First of all, the land cost.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment acquires land compulsorily, not at market  price  but\r\n\r\nat  a price fixed by the Government.  In the early days, it  was\r\n\r\n1976  price, then 1985 price.  Now we have got the January  1991\r\n\r\nprice.   All these prices are lower than the market  value.   So\r\n\r\nthe  Government has already made money on the land for a  start.\r\n\r\nIt  spends  money  on clearance cost.  Then it tenders  out  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment of HDB flats.  Of course, the Government has to take\r\n\r\naway some land for roads and other power plants.  But taking all\r\n\r\nthat into account, I believe the Government prices the land  for\r\n\r\nsale  of  each unit at market value and not the acquired  value.\r\n\r\nSo the Government has already made money on the land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the contracts, I wish the accounts of HDB could\r\n\r\ngive  the detailed contract prices of each development.  We have\r\n\r\ngot  structural and piling cost.  We have got finance  cost  and\r\n\r\nelectricity, sewerage cost.  I wish they could give all these in\r\n\r\ndetail.   We can add them all up and see how much the Government\r\n\r\nhas  spent and the number of units.  Then we would know the true\r\n\r\nvalue  of the flat.  We will take the selling price and  I  will\r\n\r\ntell you that there is no subsidy.  The Government makes on  the\r\n\r\nsale of HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I am sorry I give Mr Chiam more credit\r\n\r\nthan  it is due.  Apparently, the years of exchange with Mr  Teh\r\n\r\nand  Mr  S.  Dhanabalan have made no imprint at all.  All  these\r\n\r\nnumbers are in the HDB's accounts and they are all added up  for\r\n\r\nyou.  We do not have to give you all the individual accounts for\r\n\r\nyou  to aggregate.  These are all in the accounts audited by the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General  and published in the HDB's Annual  Report.   It\r\n\r\nshows the development cost.  It shows the selling prices and  it\r\n\r\nshows the development loss or gain for the whole year as well as\r\n\r\nper unit.  So all these numbers have been published since 1985.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is back to his old hobbyhorse about land prices.\r\n\r\nAs Mr S. Dhanabalan explained to him way back in 1988, since\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>1988&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has been buying land from the Government at a price set\r\n\r\nby  the Chief Valuer and sold by the Land Office.  That price is\r\n\r\ndetermined by the Chief Valuer.  That price is a fraction of the\r\n\r\nprivate  market land price.  It is not meaningful to talk  about\r\n\r\nland  prices based on old acquisition cost.  I have raised  this\r\n\r\nexample many times.  I will raise it again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you price a unit based on historical cost, it makes\r\n\r\nnonsense of the pricing.  For example, we are building flats  in\r\n\r\nGillman Camp.  This is an old armed forces land.  Therefore, the\r\n\r\nprice  is  free  of  charge.  We are going to  reclaim  land  in\r\n\r\nPunggol.   It is going to cost us a lot of money.  So the  price\r\n\r\nwould  be very high.  If we go by his accounting, we will  price\r\n\r\nthe  central  area  at Gillman flats much cheaper  than  Punggol\r\n\r\nflats.   Why?  Because the land historically is priced  at  zero\r\n\r\ncost  to the Government and therefore we should sell them  at  a\r\n\r\nmuch  lower price than Punggol flats.  If that is how  Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nwill  run  the  government,  then I think  he  better  gets  his\r\n\r\narithmetics and economics right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir.

I think it is better to get these  things\r\n\r\nclear  here.  I am talking about Government subsidy.  I  am  not\r\n\r\ntalking  about  market subsidy.

That is a subsidy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Government subsidy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Call it what you like, that is what\r\n\r\nSingaporeans benefit from buying an HDB flat directly  from  us.\r\n\r\nMr  Low  has his point.  You can go round.  In fact, I encourage\r\n\r\nhim  to  publicise  those  numbers that  he  has  and  draw  the\r\n\r\nconclusions from there to both the Workers' Party as well as  to\r\n\r\nall  his constituents in Hougang.  In fact, I will help him with\r\n\r\nthe   direct  mailing  list.   Tell  them  that  this   is   his\r\n\r\ncalculations,  that in the Sengkang flats, the  number  which  I\r\n\r\ngave  him,  Government  made X dollars of development  gain  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  HDB  flats are not subsidised.  Therefore,  as  their\r\n\r\nleader  and  elected  representative, he  will  advise  them  to\r\n\r\nquickly withdraw from the North-East queue because HDB flats are\r\n\r\nnot subsidised.  Please do that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Minister has got the definition of  \"subsidy\"  from.\r\n\r\nMaybe  it  is  a mixed definition.  What I understand  from  the\r\n\r\nOxford  Universal Dictionary, the definition of \"subsidy\"  is  a\r\n\r\ngrant or contribution of money.  But in this particular case,  I\r\n\r\nstated  that  for  the Sengkang flats, the  Government  makes  a\r\n\r\nprofit.  It does not contribute any money in the development  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  flats.  And I asked him just now whether  the  selling\r\n\r\nprice of flats in the north zone will increase if there are more\r\n\r\napplicants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have explained in my speech\r\n\r\nearlier,  the  Government's  pricing  policy  goes  on   certain\r\n\r\nprinciples.  First, we will price 3-room flats such that 90%  of\r\n\r\nfirst-time households would be able to afford it.  We buy  these\r\n\r\nflats from the market and we subsidise it to the level that  90%\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans can afford a 3-room flat.  Today,  that  direct\r\n\r\ngrant  is $50,000 per flat.  Similarly, when you buy a new  flat\r\n\r\nfrom Government, you are enjoying a market subsidy, what you pay\r\n\r\nfor  the flat and what the flat is worth in the open market, and\r\n\r\nthat  subsidy is $103,000 in Sengkang.  If you say that this  is\r\n\r\ninequitable,  I agree with you.  In which case, we should  raise\r\n\r\nthe prices of flats in Sengkang.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I do not think the Minister has\r\n\r\nanswered  my  questions.  I have raised two  questions.   First,\r\n\r\nwhat is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's definition of \"subsidy\", and not market subsidy?\r\n\r\nI  am talking about subsidy.  Second, will the selling price  of\r\n\r\nthe new HDB flats in the north zone be increased further if, let\r\n\r\nus  say, they are more popular, as the Minister's answer is that\r\n\r\nthe price is based on popularity?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Subsidy, as I have explained many times,\r\n\r\nis  the  difference between what you pay in the market and  what\r\n\r\nyou  are  paying  today.  That is subsidy.  For the  north  zone\r\n\r\nflats,  the  principle which I enunciated is that the Government\r\n\r\nwill subsidise the less popular areas more than the more popular\r\n\r\nareas.   Why?  Because we have a building programme and we  want\r\n\r\nto  encourage  Singaporeans to buy into the building  programme.\r\n\r\nToday,  we  have  more than 40,000 applicants  in  the  Sengkang\r\n\r\nqueue.   Why?   Because it is a very popular town.  Because  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy there is much higher.  Otherwise, why would people apply\r\n\r\nfor   Sengkang   Town?    [Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang   interrupted.]\r\n\r\nPrecisely.   And the more you raise about this issue,  the  more\r\n\r\nthe prices in Sengkang will go up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, thank you for giving\r\n\r\nme  this chance to ask the Minister a question.  I think we have\r\n\r\nheard  enough  of subsidies.  I am just asking a very  practical\r\n\r\nquestion.   I  think most of us at our meet-the-people  sessions\r\n\r\nwould  have come across this.  These upgraders who are receiving\r\n\r\nkeys  to  the new flats face this problem of not being  able  to\r\n\r\nsell their present flat.  Would the Minister  allow them to take\r\n\r\nup  the  new flats after they have sold their present flat?   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  must make some provisos.  In other  words,  if  the\r\n\r\nowner  has  made several attempts to sell his flat, and  we  can\r\n\r\ncheck  this from advertisements in the newspaper whether he  has\r\n\r\nreally made an attempt to sell his flat, and he gets no response\r\n\r\nfrom  the  advertisements, would HDB be able to buy  back  those\r\n\r\nflats at HDB's assessed value?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> HDB will generally allow a lessee more\r\n\r\ntime to dispose of his first flat, after he has taken possession\r\n\r\nof his second flat, based on evidence that he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  tried to sell off the flat but he could not find  a  buyer.\r\n\r\nHDB  will  normally extend the time for him to  dispose  of  the\r\n\r\nflat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to his second question is no, HDB will not be\r\n\r\nthe  buyer  of  last resort.  We leave it to the  individual  to\r\n\r\ndispose of his flat in the open market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, according to\r\n\r\nthe  latest  available statistics, divorces  granted  under  the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter have been increasing substantially, the  number\r\n\r\nmore  than  doubling in the space of 10 years.  Muslim  divorces\r\n\r\nalso  saw  a  steady  increase.  The  Department  of  Statistics\r\n\r\nreported that the divorce rate tends to be higher among  younger\r\n\r\nmarried persons.  The majority of divorcees were aged between 30\r\n\r\nand 39 years in divorces granted in 1996.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In divorce proceedings, the distribution of matrimonial\r\n\r\nproperty is usually an issue.  If the matrimonial home is an HDB\r\n\r\nflat, the issue is whether it be offered for sale or retained by\r\n\r\none  of  the spouses.  Several problems have occurred concerning\r\n\r\nthis  matter.   First, if they purchased  an  HDB  flat  as  the\r\n\r\nmatrimonial home, they would be treated as upgraders  when  they\r\n\r\nsell  their flat following their divorce.  This means that  they\r\n\r\nwill  be barred from applying another HDB flat for 10 years.   A\r\n\r\ncouple  who bought a flat in 1989 and who sold it in  1995  will\r\n\r\nhave to wait until 1999 before they are eligible to apply for  a\r\n\r\nnew  flat.  Meanwhile, the displaced divorcee will have to  stay\r\n\r\nwith relatives, friends or rent another flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the spouse who is given the opportunity to keep the\r\n\r\nflat  will have to be eligible under one of the schemes, execute\r\n\r\nanother mortgage and pay the other party a sum that reflects his\r\n\r\ncontribution.   This may be a mission impossible for  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  groups.  In a case that I recently dealt with,  a  young\r\n\r\nmother,  who has custody of her two children, has been asked  to\r\n\r\ntake a new mortgage of $50,000 where she is expected to pay $300\r\n\r\nper  month over 29 years, and to provide over $110,000  cash  to\r\n\r\ndischarge the existing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsum  owed.   She  only earns around $800-$900 a  month.   It  is\r\n\r\nimpossible for her to come out with such a large sum.   So,  for\r\n\r\nthis  category of persons, it appears that the rules do not work\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renting a flat is also a problem, because the divorcee\r\n\r\nmight not fall within the $800 level.  I think that level is set\r\n\r\ntoo  low.   A  more realistic figure, bearing in mind  that  the\r\n\r\nspouse  may have to take care of children, may be around $1,500.\r\n\r\nMind  you,  Sir,   this  does  not  even  mean  that  they  will\r\n\r\ndefinitely  get a flat.  The queues are long and  the  divorcees\r\n\r\nare not regarded as a special class.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, my concern is for the children of broken\r\n\r\nmarriages.  Nothing could be more traumatic for them than to see\r\n\r\ntheir  parents separating.  On top of that, they find that  they\r\n\r\nare  no longer at the home, suffer severe financial hardship and\r\n\r\nmay have to rely on the goodwill of relatives and the like.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the plight of divorcees who are unable, after they are\r\n\r\ndivorced,  to come up with funds to cover the cost of  ownership\r\n\r\nis  a very real one.  Perhaps a more flexible rental policy  can\r\n\r\nbe implemented to allow them to live as a family unit as best as\r\n\r\nthey  can.  We should, at the end of the day, also think of  the\r\n\r\nchildren  who  must  have been through a great  deal  of  mental\r\n\r\nanguish.  Let us not make it more difficult for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has just now demonstrated an incredible\r\n\r\nability  to come out with fair and just solutions.  And  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  in  this  case,  he will also do  so  for  this  group  of\r\n\r\nunfortunate people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, my topic is on HDB car\r\n\r\nparks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of electronic road pricing, the car\r\n\r\npopulation  will grow more rapidly as more COEs will be  issued.\r\n\r\nThis  will  lead  to  a  greater demand  for  car  park  places,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  HDB  estates.  I understand that  HDB  has  been\r\n\r\nbuilding  multi-storey car parks for both new estates and  those\r\n\r\nundergoing Main Upgrading Programmes (MUP).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these car park provisions will meet the new\r\n\r\ndemand, not much has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  done  to  increase the car parking places  in  semi-mature\r\n\r\nestates.   Presently,  some semi-mature estates  such  as  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang  are  facing problems of inadequate car parking  places.\r\n\r\nThus,  I  would  like  to  urge the  Minister  to  consider  the\r\n\r\nfollowing suggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Build more multi-storey car parks in semi-mature estates\r\n\r\nimmediately  to  overcome the shortage of car parks.   Available\r\n\r\nstate land or HDB land in semi-mature estates should be utilised\r\n\r\neither temporarily or permanently as car parks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Incorporate the construction of multi-storey car parks\r\n\r\ninto  the  Interim  Upgrading Programme (IUP).   The  Government\r\n\r\nshould increase the grant for IUP so that multi-storey car parks\r\n\r\ncan  be built together with the provision of landscaped gardens,\r\n\r\ncovered  linkways,  and other facilities  in  the  open  spaces.\r\n\r\nThis  will  reduce wastage when the Main Upgrading Programme  is\r\n\r\nimplemented for these estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) HDB should standardise the fees for both multi-storey car\r\n\r\nparks  and  open  space  car parks to $50  monthly.  This  would\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  grouping of car parks for  season  parking  and\r\n\r\nencourage residents to use multi-storey car parks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Convert all open space car parks for season parking\r\n\r\nonly  between  10 pm and 7 am.  Overnight parking  for  visitors\r\n\r\nshould  be restricted to multi-storey car parks or less utilised\r\n\r\nopen space car parks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Relocate trees that are occupying car park lots\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I hope the Ministry can take immediate steps\r\n\r\nto  resolve the shortage of car park lots in semi-mature estates\r\n\r\nbefore the full impact of the ERP is felt.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, with\r\n\r\nthe  aging  of  the flats in the older estates and the  frequent\r\n\r\nresale  of  flats, there are many incidences of leaking  ceiling\r\n\r\ncaused by renovation works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present HDB policy, residents who have leaking\r\n\r\nceilings will have to bear the repair cost, because the  ceiling\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  party  structure  belonging jointly to the  adjoining  flats.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the owners of these two units are jointly liable  for\r\n\r\nthe  repair  cost.   Normally, when the Area Office  receives  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint,  they  will send their officials to  investigate  the\r\n\r\nmatter  within three days.  The  Area Office will write  to  the\r\n\r\ntwo parties involved within nine days so that they could proceed\r\n\r\nwith  the  repair works.  The Area Office would  also  recommend\r\n\r\ncontractors to the residents who have difficulty in getting  the\r\n\r\nappropriate contractor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, repairing a leaking toilet would cost about\r\n\r\n$1,200.   This  means  that each unit will have  to  bear  $600.\r\n\r\nNormally,  the people living upstairs are reluctant to  pay  for\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  repair and this will cause delay in the  repairs.\r\n\r\nThe  Area Office will then have to inform the legal officers  in\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  head office and normally this will be done  one  month\r\n\r\nafter receiving the complaint.  After the first letter is issued\r\n\r\nand  if  no  action is taken by the resident living upstairs,  a\r\n\r\nreminder will be sent.  So the whole process would take about 73\r\n\r\ndays  or about two and a half months after the complaint  before\r\n\r\nwork  can commence.  Very often the people living upstairs  will\r\n\r\nsay  that  they have no money as an excuse and keep on delaying.\r\n\r\nTaking  more than three months to resolve a leaking  ceiling  in\r\n\r\nthe toilet is indeed a cause of great regret.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a multi-racial society. If the people living\r\n\r\nupstairs and downstairs are of different races they may  have  a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding caused by the language differences.  This  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  be very bad to our efforts to promote racial  harmony\r\n\r\nand  enhance social cohesion.  I feel that the Area Office could\r\n\r\nresolve  such matters as leaking toilet ceiling easily,  because\r\n\r\nas  soon  as  the  Area Office has received  the  complaint  and\r\n\r\ninvestigated,  and  found that the complaint  is  substantiated,\r\n\r\nthey  could call up the two parties involved and tell  them  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  repair and how much they have to pay.  So it could  be\r\n\r\nresolved in three to five days' time.  I hope the Minister would\r\n\r\npay more attention to this matter because this is happening more\r\n\r\nand more often now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, the Transitional Rental Housing\r\n\r\nScheme  (TRHS) was introduced in October 1991 with  the  aim  of\r\n\r\nproviding  interim housing to young couples who are waiting  for\r\n\r\nthe  completion of their home ownership flats.  In October 1995,\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  introduced improvements to the TRHS to make it  easier\r\n\r\nfor  first-time applicants to get interim housing.  As a result,\r\n\r\nthe   demand  for  TRHS  flats  more  than  doubled  from  1,200\r\n\r\napplications  in  July  1995 to an average  of  2,800  in  every\r\n\r\nquarterly  exercise subsequently.  In  the July  1997  quarterly\r\n\r\nexercise,  2,840 applications were received for the  500  units.\r\n\r\nHDB  introduced various new measures in October  1997  with  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of 1-room flats and the buying back of 2- and  3-room\r\n\r\nflats  from the open market.  HDB increased the number of  flats\r\n\r\noffered  under  each TRHS quarterly exercise by  20%,  from  the\r\n\r\ncurrent 500-600 units from the October 1997 exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud HDB for this effort. However, what I would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister is about the waiting time for the TRHS\r\n\r\napplicants.  As he has mentioned just now, the queuing time  for\r\n\r\nRegistration of Flats Scheme (RFS) has been reduced drastically,\r\n\r\nfrom about five years to even two years for some areas.  I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister whether there are similar guidelines to\r\n\r\nreduce the waiting time for TRHS applicants, because for many of\r\n\r\nthem  who need interim housing, there is a more urgent  need  to\r\n\r\nget  this  housing  because of the size of the  family  and  for\r\n\r\nvarious  other  reasons,  as we hear  from  our  meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsession  cases.  Therefore, it is more urgent for  them  to  get\r\n\r\nthis housing.   I would like to ask the Minister whether HDB has\r\n\r\na similar target to shorten waiting time for TRHS applicants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nwith regard to the Government's announcement to freeze JTC's and\r\n\r\nHDB's  rentals for industrial and commercial properties, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  convey  the gratitude on behalf of the industrial  and\r\n\r\ncommercial sector in Singapore.  This shows that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  is beginning to attach importance to the problem  of\r\n\r\nexorbitant  rentals  faced  by  the  industrial  and  commercial\r\n\r\nsector.   However,  I regret to say that the Government has  yet\r\n\r\nto  thoroughly  resolve this problem,  to embody the  spirit  of\r\n\r\ncommon sharing of joy and sorrow among the tripartite parties of\r\n\r\nlabour, management and Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the years, the small and medium-sized enterprises\r\n\r\nhave been  loyal tenants of HDB.  In response to HDB raising its\r\n\r\nrental  year  by year, they have been taking it in their  stride\r\n\r\nand  appear to be rather helpless.   Once they do not accept the\r\n\r\nrental increases they will have to get ready to move out  or  to\r\n\r\nwind  up  the business which they have painstakingly  built  up.\r\n\r\nThey  will  have to suffer great business and financial  losses.\r\n\r\nWhy  has  HDB  been turning a blind eye to the hardship  of  the\r\n\r\ntenants?   Is  it because they are not interested in  the  well-being of the tenants?   When adjusting the rentals, HDB seems to\r\n\r\ngive  people the impression that it is very calculative and very\r\n\r\n\"kiasu\".   In the final analysis, it must be closely  linked  to\r\n\r\nthe budget objectives set by  HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From HDB's budget, we can see that in leasing out the\r\n\r\nindustrial  and commercial  properties, HDB's main objective  is\r\n\r\nto  make a profit and the rentals are pegged to the highest rate\r\n\r\nin  the  market.    According  to the workload  and  performance\r\n\r\nindicators  set  down  in the budget, the   rate  of  return  of\r\n\r\ncommercial  properties has actually been raised   from  8.2%  in\r\n\r\n1993  to  11.7%  in 1997, and the rate of  return of  industrial\r\n\r\nproperties  has increased from 13.7% in 1993 to 19.7%  in  1997.\r\n\r\nAlthough this year HDB has adjusted the estimated rate of return\r\n\r\ndown to 10.9% for commercial properties, it is still higher than\r\n\r\nthe  10.7% in 1996.   As for industrial properties, although the\r\n\r\nestimated  rate  of  return has been  adjusted  downwards  to  3\r\n\r\npercentage  points  lower than the 18.8% in 1996,  it  is  still\r\n\r\nmaintained  at  a  high  of  15.7%.  Apparently,  faced  with  a\r\n\r\nsituation of not being able to \"have the cake and eat  it\",  HDB\r\n\r\nwill  necessarily overlook the business cost and competitiveness\r\n\r\nof its tenants when it fixes its rentals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a gigantic landlord, HDB, in fixing the supply of\r\n\r\nindustrial  and  commercial properties  and  their  rentals,  is\r\n\r\ncapable  of  influencing the rentals and business  cost  of  the\r\n\r\nentire  market. In this difficult time, if HDB still insists  on\r\n\r\nmaintaining  a high profit, then it will not only be unrealistic\r\n\r\nbut  also  will force many SMEs to stop their business,  thereby\r\n\r\naggravating  the  adverse conditions of  our  economy.   I  must\r\n\r\nemphasize  that  the industrial and commercial  rentals  in  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries are already very cheap  as  compared  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, in the light of the substantial devaluation of  their\r\n\r\ncurrencies.    It will be extremely difficult for  Singapore  to\r\n\r\ncompete with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I would like to appeal to the Government to review\r\n\r\nthe  objectives and policies of HDB in terms of rental  revision\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  it will  not overlook the overall  competitive\r\n\r\nedge of our country while trying to make a surplus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, rentals of private properties have already\r\n\r\ncome   down.     HDB's   rentals   should   also   be   adjusted\r\n\r\ncorrespondingly to be closer to the market price and should  not\r\n\r\nremain at the high level.  As regards the 15% rebate on property\r\n\r\ntax  for  commercial and industrial properties, as announced  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government, I consider it as negligible as compared to  the\r\n\r\nvery high rentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to help lighten the rental burden of the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community so that  more funds could be  channelled  to\r\n\r\nimproving the productivity of different business operations, and\r\n\r\nat the same time to maintain our competitive edge, vis-a-vis our\r\n\r\nneighbours,   I urge the Government to make a resolute  decision\r\n\r\nto  take appropriate measures to further lower HDB's factory and\r\n\r\nshop  rentals.  At the same time, I hope that related  agencies,\r\n\r\nlike  JTC and PSA will also take corresponding measures to lower\r\n\r\nthe  rentals of their industrial land, factories and  warehouses\r\n\r\nso as to help  the business community to keep the operation cost\r\n\r\nat a reasonable level, and to maintain our competitive edge over\r\n\r\nour neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, just like the\r\n\r\nHDB  residential  estates, the old HDB industrial  estates  also\r\n\r\nneed major upgrading or redevelopment in order to better utilize\r\n\r\nthe  land,  many of which are on prime locations.  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nwill  also  lead to more well designed industrial premises  with\r\n\r\nmore  modern  and efficient features and facilities.   It  would\r\n\r\nenhance  the productivity of lessees and tenants, many  of  whom\r\n\r\nare   small   and   medium-sized  enterprises.    Although   the\r\n\r\nredevelopment of HDB industrial estates has been announced  last\r\n\r\nyear, I am not sure if every affected tenant or lessee has  been\r\n\r\ninformed.   I  would like to ask the Minister whether  HDB  will\r\n\r\ninform those affected as early as possible so that they can plan\r\n\r\nfor their relocation.  I would also like to know the response of\r\n\r\nthose who have been informed so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the economic downturn, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  what  further measures HDB would take  to  help  their\r\n\r\ntenants and lessees tide over this difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> Sir, HDB industrial estates were mostly\r\n\r\ndeveloped in the 70s and 80s to cater for small and medium-sized\r\n\r\nfactories  which  were  then  affected  by  land  clearance  and\r\n\r\nresettlement.  With continued economic growth over the last  two\r\n\r\ndecades, the business volumes of these factories have grown  and\r\n\r\nfactory  space  is  now grossly inadequate  in  supporting  this\r\n\r\nexpansion.  For example, the roads are very narrow and therefore\r\n\r\nconstantly  jammed  by  heavy vehicles.  With  the  loading  and\r\n\r\nunloading  of goods, sometimes occupying one side of  the  road,\r\n\r\nbottlenecks  have  resulted,  affecting  the  flow  of  traffic.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  there is an acute shortage of  parking  space  for\r\n\r\ncontainer  trucks.  Defu industrial estate which is  located  in\r\n\r\nPaya Lebar constituency is a case in point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development is aware of the above\r\n\r\nproblems and in February 1997 HDB announced that under  the  HDB\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Redevelopment Programme it will redevelop industrial\r\n\r\nestates  in stages, with the programme ending in the year  2007.\r\n\r\nFor industrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntenants  in the Defu industrial estate, they will probably  have\r\n\r\nto wait for another 7 to 10 years before their lease expires and\r\n\r\nredevelopment can take place.  However, during this  period,  it\r\n\r\nis  difficult  for  them to continue to expand production  under\r\n\r\npresent conditions.  Due to space constraint, some tenants  have\r\n\r\nresorted  to  building mezzanine floors illegally  or  undertake\r\n\r\nillegal   extensions   of  existing  factory   premises.    Once\r\n\r\ndiscovered   by  HDB  they  will  be  ordered  to  remove   such\r\n\r\nalterations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to solve their problems, I would like to suggest\r\n\r\nthat  HDB  bring  forward the plan to redevelop Defu  industrial\r\n\r\nestate as soon as possible.  HDB can compensate the tenants  for\r\n\r\nthe   unexpired  lease  period  by  offering  them  new  factory\r\n\r\npremises.   HDB  should also consider building one  or  two  new\r\n\r\nblocks of multi-storey buildings there for those who would  like\r\n\r\nto  move  into  a bigger factory space as soon as  possible  and\r\n\r\ndevelop the rest of the estate in stages.  Meanwhile, for  those\r\n\r\nwho  have to wait a few more years for their new factories,  HDB\r\n\r\nshould consider permitting some reasonable extension of space as\r\n\r\nlong  as the extension and the resultant structures meet  safety\r\n\r\nrequirements.  Where possible, road widening should  be  carried\r\n\r\nout and more temporary car parks built for heavy vehicles in the\r\n\r\nestate.   In  this  manner,  the inconvenience  of  an  outdated\r\n\r\nindustrial estate can be minimised for the time being while  the\r\n\r\ntenants wait for a totally revamped industrial estate in Defu.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, before I ask the\r\n\r\nquestion, I wish to declare my interest as a management staff of\r\n\r\nNTUC Fairprice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have a land use planning policy where\r\n\r\nvarious categories of land are designated for various uses, some\r\n\r\nfor  industries, some for commercial, and some for  residential.\r\n\r\nThere  is a category of retailers or foreign retailers who  have\r\n\r\ncome into Singapore and who have been using industrial spaces or\r\n\r\nland for such kind of retail purposes.  I am not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalking about warehouse sales.  Warehouse sales where warehouses\r\n\r\noccasionally  have their sales once in a while for promotion  or\r\n\r\nfor  clearance,  that is acceptable.  But  I  am  talking  about\r\n\r\nindustrial  land or warehouses actually being used  as  shopping\r\n\r\ncomplexes.   Land being scarce in Singapore, the proper  use  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  land should be for industries to generate  jobs  for\r\n\r\nhigh-value added contribution to the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can look into this aspect of it and not\r\n\r\nallow  such retailers who come in with new concepts  and  so  on\r\n\r\nusing  such kind of industrial land.  The difference is  because\r\n\r\ncommercial  rentals and industrial rentals vary by  a  very  big\r\n\r\nfactor, two to three times.  So people who operate in this  kind\r\n\r\nof situation, in this kind of land or spaces, have a very unfair\r\n\r\nadvantage.   The  retail  sector  in  Singapore  right  now   is\r\n\r\nsuffering  and  it is not a joy to see the state of  competition\r\n\r\nbeing so uneven.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, my topic is on cost\r\n\r\nreduction  for  public projects.  I would like  to  propose  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  measures to reduce the construction  cost  of  public\r\n\r\nprojects for the Ministry to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Design-and-build tenders. All public projects should\r\n\r\nnot invite more than 3 firms for design-and-build tenders. It is\r\n\r\ncostly  and  time-consuming to prepare such  tenders  especially\r\n\r\nwhen  details and models are required for the tender submission.\r\n\r\nThis  would  reduce  wastage of resources  of  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.   I  understand that HDB has adopted this measure  and\r\n\r\nwould urge all other Government departments to follow likewise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Bulk purchase of basic building materials. All\r\n\r\nGovernment departments should adopt HDB's approach in purchasing\r\n\r\nbasic  building  materials in bulk for  contractors  working  in\r\n\r\ntheir   projects.   This  procurement  method   provides   price\r\n\r\nstability, ensures availability of material supply, and  reduces\r\n\r\nthe cost of building materials.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Clerk-of-work and resident engineer. We need to review\r\n\r\nthe roles and impact of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclerk-of-work  and  resident engineer  on  the  productivity  of\r\n\r\npublic  projects.  The performance of clerk-of-work and resident\r\n\r\nengineer  should  be  closely  monitored  as  they  have  direct\r\n\r\ninfluence on the progress of the project.  They should  be  paid\r\n\r\nby employers and inclusive of overtime charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Standardization and modularization. Public projects\r\n\r\nshould  adopt a high level of standardization and modularization\r\n\r\nof  building components and elements.  Standard sizes of  beams,\r\n\r\ncolumns, floor slabs, windows and doors will facilitate the  use\r\n\r\nof  precast  technology  and  mass manufacturing.   The  use  of\r\n\r\nstandard components will expedite construction and also increase\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Project financing. Government departments can provide\r\n\r\nproject  financing  such  as  advance  initial  payment,  timely\r\n\r\nprogress payment, and early settlement of final accounts.   This\r\n\r\nwould  reduce  the borrowing cost of contractors, thus  reducing\r\n\r\nthe cost of public projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Provide housing for foreign workers. Recently, JTC has\r\n\r\nbeen  purchasing  HDB flats to rent them out to  their  workers.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  the  Ministry should also consider either  allocating\r\n\r\nlow cost land for contractors to build housing for their foreign\r\n\r\nworkers or build housing for these workers.  In addition, vacant\r\n\r\nsite  or vacant state land should be let out at lower rental  to\r\n\r\ncontractors for site office and storage purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Disposal of construction wastes. It is costly to dump\r\n\r\nconstruction wastes such as excavated earth, metal, wood,  glass\r\n\r\nand concrete waste.  Presently, all contractors are making their\r\n\r\nown  arrangements to dispose these construction wastes which may\r\n\r\nbe uneconomical at times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should centralise and out-source the disposal\r\n\r\nof  construction wastes to disposal firms.  Term contracts could\r\n\r\nbe  called for different regions.  This would provide and reduce\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of waste disposal drastically, and also at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime prevent indiscriminate dumping of wastes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, there are many condominiums and\r\n\r\nlanded  properties  that are being used as boarding  houses  for\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  As there is a healthy demand for  this,  many\r\n\r\nhouse  owners  are increasingly leasing out their properties  to\r\n\r\nforeign workers and, of course, with the permission granted from\r\n\r\nURA.  But somehow it seems that the number of applications is on\r\n\r\nthe increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem really is the abuse by foreign workers of\r\n\r\nthese  rented  dwelling units, especially in landed  properties,\r\n\r\nparticularly terrace houses which house up to 30 to 40 people in\r\n\r\none dwelling unit.  In fact, there are many such rental dwelling\r\n\r\nunits  in  various parts of Singapore.  In my own  constituency,\r\n\r\nthe  practice  is  somewhat prevalent  in  the  Cambridge  area,\r\n\r\nCarlisle  Road area, and around the Sing Avenue and  Joo  Avenue\r\n\r\nareas.  These foreign workers are probably village folks who are\r\n\r\nignorant that they are a nuisance to their neighbours and may be\r\n\r\noblivious  of the mess that they create around the  house,  with\r\n\r\ntheir sardine tins, broken beer bottles and the loads of rubbish\r\n\r\nthat  they  create.   Or  they  may  be  just  jealous,  perhaps\r\n\r\nvindictive,  of their richer Singapore neighbours.  Ignorant  or\r\n\r\nvindictive, their action has caused an avalanche of problems for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans living in the estate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me highlight some of these problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Many of these foreign worker dwelling units are not\r\n\r\nonly  packed  with  workers, but are also packed  with  lots  of\r\n\r\nwooden  furniture  and  partitions that they  become  real  fire\r\n\r\nhazards.   Sir, I refer the House to this Straits Times  report,\r\n\r\n4th  January  1998, written by Mr Jasbir Singh, and  he  stated:\r\n\r\n\"This  is  the second time in less than two months that  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers have died in a shophouse blaze.  On November 15th,  four\r\n\r\nMalaysians were killed in a Jalan Besar fire staying in quarters\r\n\r\nlike this.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Then, just a few days ago, there is reason to believe\r\n\r\nthat foreign workers' housing also facilitates mosquito breeding\r\n\r\nand  is causing dengue fever.  Straits Times, 14th March, stated\r\n\r\n28  cases  of  dengue fever near Tan Tock Seng  Hospital  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) These foreign workers cause noise pollution because\r\n\r\nthey  tend  to speak very loud, especially at night,  disturbing\r\n\r\nthe neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Some of these foreign workers have been caught for snatch\r\n\r\nthefts  or  outraging  of modesty of the females  in  the  area.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  having  these workers in  the  area  is  a  security\r\n\r\nhazard; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) All these problems result in a drop in the valuation of\r\n\r\nproperties  in the area which further upsets Singaporean  owners\r\n\r\nliving in these neighbourhoods.  And it is no fault of theirs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I asked my constituency's private residents' committee\r\n\r\nand  the  constituency's secretariat to take  up  this  critical\r\n\r\nissue  with the URA.  The reply from URA stated:  \"The  Planning\r\n\r\nAct   does  not  control  the  number  of  people  residing   in\r\n\r\nresidential estates and neither does it regulate the  rental  of\r\n\r\nresidential properties.\"  In other words, the number  of  people\r\n\r\nresiding  is not regulated in a particular unit.  Then we  wrote\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry  of Labour.  The reply from  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour stated:  \"It is stated in the work permit condition  that\r\n\r\nan employer must provide adequate housing for the foreign worker\r\n\r\nemployed  by  him.\"  And they went on and ended  the  letter  by\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"However, the Ministry of Labour is not  the  authority\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  specifying the building  requirements.\"   Then\r\n\r\nsomeone   checked  with  BCD  under  the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment to see whether they control the number of  residents\r\n\r\nin a dwelling unit, and BCD has no control either.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have been talking to URA, Ministry of Labour, BCD,\r\n\r\nENV, the Police to solve some of these security problems and  so\r\n\r\non,  and  yet  the  problems  remain unsolved,  except  for  the\r\n\r\noccasional  raids  by URA and others on some of  these  dwelling\r\n\r\nunits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, certainly this episode looks like an episode out of\r\n\r\nthe British TV series, \"Yes, Minister\".  Therefore, I would like\r\n\r\nto urge the Minister to look into the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To work much closely with other bodies, like MTI, JTC\r\n\r\nand  so  on,  to  ensure that workers are not  housed  in  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  in urban areas or landed properties but in other  older\r\n\r\nflats in outskirts, preferably away from Singaporean housing, if\r\n\r\nthat can be found.  I think, to some extent, this is being done.\r\n\r\nJTC  is buying up more flats.  But I think the pace needs to  be\r\n\r\nhastened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Ministry needs to coordinate all the foreign worker\r\n\r\nhousing-related  matters and find ways to  tighten  the  present\r\n\r\nguidelines  and  look  into  possible  changes  in  legislation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Planning Act needs to be reviewed to restrict  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  foreign  workers that can  be  housed  in  a  single\r\n\r\ndwelling  unit,  and to look into things like  fire  prevention,\r\n\r\nfire safety and security concerns of neighbouring residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps there is a need for a multi-agency task force\r\n\r\nto  be  set up to resolve these pertinent problems that irritate\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans  unnecessarily.  On this  number  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  in a dwelling unit, I just want to end by saying,  even\r\n\r\nthe Geneva Convention has got restrictions on how big a prisoner\r\n\r\ncell  should  be.   So I think we should not  deteriorate  below\r\n\r\nthese guidelines.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  urge  the HDB to take some strict  measures  to\r\n\r\nprevent  old air-conditioning units in high-rise buildings  from\r\n\r\nbecoming  killers.   Recently, it was reported in the  newspaper\r\n\r\nthat in Tampines Avenue 5, an old air-conditioner unit, weighing\r\n\r\nsome  10  kg, dropped from the eighth storey of an HDB block  to\r\n\r\nthe  ground  floor.  Fortunately, it did not hit  any  one.  The\r\n\r\nincident happened because the weather-battered metal support for\r\n\r\nthe  window unit air-conditioner gave way and could not  support\r\n\r\nthe weight of the air-conditioner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the report, there were a total of three such\r\n\r\nincidents  last year, two of them were at Nee Soon  and  one  in\r\n\r\nClementi.  Fortunately, no one was injured by these falling air-conditioners from high-rise buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that there are about 240,000 units of air-conditioners in these HDB estates and many of them are window-\r\n\r\nunit  air-conditioners.  So if there is no  strict  control  and\r\n\r\nregular inspection on them, one day disaster may come from above\r\n\r\nand  some  people  may be injured or even killed.   If  such  an\r\n\r\nunfortunate incident is to happen, then I think it is cause  for\r\n\r\nregret.   I think this can be avoided and prevented.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  in the HDB estates, we are now getting more and more  air-conditioners  being installed.  I think we should  do  something\r\n\r\nabout it to prevent unfortunate incidents from happening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these air-conditioners, there are also a lot of\r\n\r\nother  problems.   One of them is the water  dripping  from  the\r\n\r\nunits. In many cases, the outflow pipes of air-conditioners were\r\n\r\nnot  connected  to the bathrooms, as required by  the  HDB.   In\r\n\r\nother words, the water will drip direct into the unit downstairs\r\n\r\nand  cause a lot of unhappiness to the people below.  Sometimes,\r\n\r\nthe  condensed water will drip on to the ground floor, resulting\r\n\r\nin moss to be gathered and inconvenience to the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think HDB should look at this matter seriously and take\r\n\r\nmore  stringent measures against the culprits.  There should  be\r\n\r\nregular  inspections on the air-conditioners in the HDB  estates\r\n\r\nto  ensure that the owners have their air-conditioners  serviced\r\n\r\nregularly.

The Consumers  Association  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  has had occasion to blacklist plumbers,  electricians\r\n\r\nand  renovation  contractors who have no  qualms  about  earning\r\n\r\nexcessive fees for their services, and low quality services, and\r\n\r\nearning such fees in unconscionable situations.  The usual modus\r\n\r\noperandi  of  such scoundrels is to advertise in the  classified\r\n\r\nadvertisements  of  the newspapers promising services  for  what\r\n\r\nlooks  like  reasonable charges.  When they have finished  their\r\n\r\nwork,  which may actually be simple work, they claim that  their\r\n\r\noriginal  fees  have to be increased because of certain  special\r\n\r\nwork or equipment that they had used, without first seeking  the\r\n\r\nconsent  of  the householder.  Some of them have  even  inflated\r\n\r\ntheir charges 300 times more than what they have advertised  and\r\n\r\nused  coercion to obtain payment, for example, by escorting  the\r\n\r\nhouseholders to the ATM machines to withdraw cash.  Others  have\r\n\r\nmasqueraded  as  contractors engaged by HDB to do  upgrading  of\r\n\r\ntheir  flats.   They have preyed mainly on the elderly  and  the\r\n\r\nilliterate  who are more easily awed by officialdom and  threats\r\n\r\nof force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another source of frustration for householders is generated\r\n\r\nby  house removers.  These unscrupulous persons advertised cheap\r\n\r\nrates  for house removal also in the classifieds and would  even\r\n\r\npromise  householders  whatever they ask for:  covered  lorries,\r\n\r\nfree  boxes; everything moved in one trip, etc.  The householder\r\n\r\nthen fixes a date for moving and gets all packed up.  On the day\r\n\r\nof  the move, the workers turn up late and refuse to work unless\r\n\r\npaid overtime, or claim that the items in the house are far  too\r\n\r\nmany  to be moved in one trip, or turn up with lorries different\r\n\r\nfrom  those promised.  In the end, the householder has no choice\r\n\r\nbut to pay up because there is no way he can find an alternative\r\n\r\nmover  at  such short notice and so late in the day.   Sir,  the\r\n\r\nlist  of  tricks  goes on and on.  It is time we  licensed  such\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, we have a rather complicated and yet incomplete\r\n\r\nsystem of licensing such services.  Plumbers are licensed by ENV\r\n\r\nand  PUB, depending on whether they are sanitary or non-sanitary\r\n\r\nplumbers;  electricians are licensed by PUB; certain  renovation\r\n\r\ncompanies  are licensed by HDB, but not all; and house  removers\r\n\r\nare   not  regulated  by  any  agency.   They  are  a  law  unto\r\n\r\nthemselves.   The woes they inflict on unsuspecting householders\r\n\r\ncome about in the unfair way they conduct their businesses or in\r\n\r\nthe  poor quality of their services. Householders who have  been\r\n\r\ntaken  for  a  ride,  however,  cannot  find  redress  from  the\r\n\r\nlicensing  agencies because the agencies do not appear  to  have\r\n\r\npowers to require the tradesmen to do their businesses in a fair\r\n\r\nway.   The  so-called licensing is really a register  of  people\r\n\r\nwith  such  skills and licensing authorities are only  concerned\r\n\r\nwhether  these  people  have  the  correct  training  or  proper\r\n\r\nbusiness addresses for service of notices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this cannot be right. We are not a nation of robbers\r\n\r\nand  highwaymen.  Why do we permit such unconscionable  conduct?\r\n\r\nWhy  do  we have no laws or licensing requirements to  root  out\r\n\r\nsuch  underhanded ways of ripping off our poor  and  uneducated,\r\n\r\nour  law-abiding citizens who entrust their matters to companies\r\n\r\nwhich they mistakenly believe have been cleared and licensed  by\r\n\r\nthe authorities?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to add to the litany of woes, there are all sorts of\r\n\r\n\"real estate agents\" also who earn 1% or 2% of the sale price of\r\n\r\nHDB  flats  and  houses  without doing a single  thing  for  the\r\n\r\nhouseholder.   Fortunately, such agents have now got  to  attend\r\n\r\nclasses  before they are given licences to practise.  And  their\r\n\r\ncertificates are issued by the IRAS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we need is a single agency that members of the\r\n\r\npublic  can go to if they have been taken advantage of by crooks\r\n\r\nsuch  as  these, who will then get their licences revoked.   The\r\n\r\nlist of licence holders can be checked by householders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  need such services.  Advertisers who have no licences  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  allowed to advertise and the media companies should  be\r\n\r\nrequired  by  law to check such credentials before allowing  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to  advertise.  In this way, fly-by-night  operators\r\n\r\nwill  disappear overnight because they have no way to  advertise\r\n\r\ntheir  services.  The one-stop agency is for the convenience  of\r\n\r\nthe  public  and to prevent confusion.  It will also  result  in\r\n\r\nbetter control of such tradesmen and professionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit can be called the Housing Services Licensing Unit\r\n\r\nand  will exist to help trade associations to set trade,  safety\r\n\r\nand   training  standards  to  instill  professionalism.   These\r\n\r\nstandards can be formulated and applied by the respective  trade\r\n\r\nassociations  which should have powers to penalise violators  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own ethical standards.  This could include the  power  to\r\n\r\nrecommend that recalcitrant tradesmen's licences be revoked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move now to my last amendment. The Minister said\r\n\r\nyesterday  that the Government is \"still committed to  upgrading\r\n\r\nprivate estates\" but has postponed this in these austere  times.\r\n\r\nSo  that means when good times return and HDB estates have  been\r\n\r\nupgraded,  it  will  be the turn of the private  estates  to  be\r\n\r\nupgraded.   Even before that time comes, there will be occasions\r\n\r\nwhere MPs would like to improve and maintain the environment  of\r\n\r\ntheir residents in private estates and develop common facilities\r\n\r\nsuch  as  street  furniture, footpaths  and  neighbourhood  park\r\n\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a situation, it will be good to have an\r\n\r\nadministrative  infrastructure at the local  level  for  MPs  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the quality of life of their private estate voters.   I\r\n\r\nsubmit that such an agency and infrastructure already exists  in\r\n\r\nthe  shape  of the town councils.  They have the experience  and\r\n\r\nexpertise.  They can be given more responsibilities, such as the\r\n\r\nprovision  of municipal services, such as cleaning  and  garbage\r\n\r\ndisposal  and the upgrading and maintenance of common facilities\r\n\r\nin  such  estates.  The town councils will then be in charge  of\r\n\r\n`real'  towns  and  MPs  will no longer  be  in  the  unenviable\r\n\r\nposition of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing  accused  of  neglecting their private  estate  residents.\r\n\r\nWould the Minister please study this proposal?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, feedback received from architects,\r\n\r\nengineers  and  developers  indicate  that  although  they   are\r\n\r\ngenerally  satisfied with Government regulation on the  building\r\n\r\nand  construction  industry, they would like to  see  a  central\r\n\r\nregulatory body to coordinate all approvals required, from  fire\r\n\r\nsafety   to   compliance  with  other  buildings   and   control\r\n\r\nregulations.   What I am proposing is basically a one-stop  shop\r\n\r\nfor  architects, engineers and developers.  It is also  in  line\r\n\r\nwith  quality  service that the Government has been emphasising.\r\n\r\nI  am  not sure how this can be best organised and whether  this\r\n\r\ncentral  body should come under the purview of the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development  or the Building  Control  Department.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister to comment on this suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, can I have your permission to take the\r\n\r\nthree cuts together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Thank you. The first subject is on\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Construction.  The construction industry has  grown\r\n\r\ninto  a  sizeable  sector contributing 7%  to  8%  to  our  GDP.\r\n\r\nDespite its growth, the industry is faced with problems  of  low\r\n\r\nproductivity,  shortage  of skilled labour,  rising  cost,  poor\r\n\r\nimage  and a slow growth in the export of construction services.\r\n\r\nThere   is   a  lack  of  concerted  effort  to  spearhead   the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above problems are attributed to the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Limited authority and resources of the Construction\r\n\r\nIndustry Development Board (CIDB).  In 1984, the CIDB was set up\r\n\r\nto  spearhead,  promote,  develop and monitor  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.   Although  CIDB has achieved  moderate  success,  the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry is still experiencing the same problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIDB, being a statutory board under the Ministry, has\r\n\r\nlimited authority and resource constraints.  As a result, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry  is still unable  to  upgrade  to  better\r\n\r\ncontribute to our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Lack of one-stop approval centre for building\r\n\r\napprovals.   The  development of a building  requires  approvals\r\n\r\nfrom various Government departments, such as URA, BCD, ENV, PWD,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.   The productivity and workload of these Government\r\n\r\ndepartments vary.  Thus, approvals for projects may  be  delayed\r\n\r\nby one or two departments which are either having heavy workload\r\n\r\nor less productive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Government officers are not accountable for the\r\n\r\nproductivity  of  building projects.   Thus,  they  may  not  be\r\n\r\nmotivated to expedite the approval process.  We need to  provide\r\n\r\na  one-stop  approval  service for building  projects  and  give\r\n\r\nincentives  to  Government officials who have  made  efforts  to\r\n\r\nincrease the productivity of projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Bad experiences in venturing overseas. A number of\r\n\r\ncontractors  have ventured overseas but many have lost  lots  of\r\n\r\nmoney.   Some have wound up their businesses.  While contractors\r\n\r\ndo  not  expect  the Government to provide any direct  financial\r\n\r\nassistance,  they  hope the Government will provide  support  to\r\n\r\nreduce their risk exposure when venturing overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent initiative by TDB to include Singapore as a\r\n\r\nsignatory  in  MIGA is indeed a positive step  towards  reducing\r\n\r\npolitical risks faced by firms venturing abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government should also provide incentives\r\n\r\nfor  banks  and  supporting  industries  to  join  venture  with\r\n\r\nconstruction  firms to form conglomerates which are  capable  of\r\n\r\ncompeting  in the international market.  I understand that  many\r\n\r\nconstruction  firms  are  well  backed  by  private  banks   and\r\n\r\nconstruction-related  firms  when  they  tender   for   projects\r\n\r\noverseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, countries like Japan, China and Israel have Ministries\r\n\r\nof  Construction to spearhead their construction industries.   I\r\n\r\nam sure we can learn from these countries and develop a Ministry\r\n\r\nof Construction to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspearhead  our  construction industry in  the  next  millennium.\r\n\r\nLast year, I gave several suggestions to the Minister to upgrade\r\n\r\nthe  construction industry.  I hope the Minister will update the\r\n\r\nHouse on the status of the upgrading of the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next topic is on construction dispute resolution.\r\n\r\nDespite  all  the  Government's initiatives and incentives,  the\r\n\r\nproductivity of the construction industry is still low.  One  of\r\n\r\nthe main contributing factors to this phenomenon is the lack  of\r\n\r\nteamwork  and adversarial working culture among parties involved\r\n\r\nin  a  building  project.  Construction disputes are  common  at\r\n\r\nconstruction   sites.   These  disputes   often   sour   working\r\n\r\nrelationships, thus resulting in delays in completion  time  and\r\n\r\npoor quality of work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, parties have to go into litigation to\r\n\r\nresolve  their  disputes, thus further increasing  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nconstruction.   If  this situation is allowed to  continue,  the\r\n\r\nproductivity  of  our  construction  industry  will   never   be\r\n\r\nimproved.   We  need  to  adopt a more cordial  and  cooperative\r\n\r\napproach to resolving disputes in the construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend the Ministry of Law for initiating mediation\r\n\r\nas  a  form  of  dispute resolution.  With the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) was  set  up  in\r\n\r\nAugust 1997 to provide amicable and fair resolution of disputes.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  the  SMC  has  formed an  Advisory  Committee  on\r\n\r\nConstruction    Mediation   comprising   representatives    from\r\n\r\nconstruction related professional bodies to promote mediation in\r\n\r\nthe construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to declare my interest as a member of\r\n\r\nthis   Advisory  Committee.   To  encourage  mediation  in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry, I would urge the Ministry to consider the\r\n\r\nfollowing suggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Include a mediation clause in the public standard form\r\n\r\nof contract to refer all disputes to SMC for resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Include a condition in the sale of land tender\r\n\r\nrequiring  private  developers to insert a mediation  clause  in\r\n\r\ntheir contract when engaging construction firms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Provide training grant for construction-related\r\n\r\npersonnel  to  understand the use of mediation  as  a  tool  for\r\n\r\ndispute resolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provide more support to SMC to run the centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last topic is landscape along roads and expressways. I\r\n\r\nagree  with  the National Parks' mission \"To make Singapore  our\r\n\r\ngarden\".   But  we  need to adopt a more practical  approach  to\r\n\r\nmaintaining greenery in Singapore.  In land scarce Singapore, if\r\n\r\nwe  strictly  adopt  a  \"No removal of trees\"  policy,  we  will\r\n\r\nultimately face serious maintenance problems in our landscape.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there have been a number of accidents at the\r\n\r\nexpressways  involving  water tankers  that  were  carrying  out\r\n\r\nmaintenance works along these roads.  As reported in The Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  on  27th January 1998, the LTA has made it mandatory  for\r\n\r\ncontractors  to  install  shock-absorbing  device  to  safeguard\r\n\r\nworkers  and  motorists.  Instead of solving  the  problem,  the\r\n\r\nauthority  has  actually placed a device on our  expressway  for\r\n\r\ncars  to  knock.   This solution is indeed very  disturbing  and\r\n\r\ncosts  the  contractor $40,000 to install such a  device.   This\r\n\r\nextra  cost  will result in higher construction and  maintenance\r\n\r\ncost of our roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Ministry to review its policy of\r\n\r\nlandscaping and growing trees along the central divider of roads\r\n\r\nand expressways.  Landscaping along these dividers poses several\r\n\r\nproblems:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It requires frequent maintenance, such as watering,\r\n\r\nfertilising  and pruning.  The maintenance trucks cause  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion and pose safety hazards to other road users.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Mature trees tend to fall or have fallen branches\r\n\r\nduring  the  monsoon  season,  thus  endangering  the  lives  of\r\n\r\nmotorists.  Whenever there is a heavy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndownpour,  trees along roads are often reported to  have  fallen\r\n\r\nand injuring motorists or causing traffic congestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The leaves of trees and shrubs cause blockage of the\r\n\r\ndrainage  system  along the central divider, thus  resulting  in\r\n\r\nwater  ponding in certain areas during rainy days.  These  water\r\n\r\nponds  have  caused  cars and motorcycles to skid  resulting  in\r\n\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Workers who are maintaining the landscape along central\r\n\r\ndividers  tend  to be too engrossed in their work.   Thus,  they\r\n\r\nsometimes disregard their own safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above problems, I hope the Ministry could\r\n\r\nreview  its  policy  to remove all landscape along  the  central\r\n\r\ndividers  of our roads and expressways.  In certain expressways,\r\n\r\nthe  central  divider  is wide enough to be  converted  into  an\r\n\r\nemergency  lane  for ambulance or for diverting  traffic  during\r\n\r\ncongestion.   Furthermore, mature trees along  roads  should  be\r\n\r\ntied  back, if possible, to prevent them from falling  onto  our\r\n\r\nroads.   The  above measures would certainly improve the  safety\r\n\r\nand traffic flow of our roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tay is not here. You can continue with\r\n\r\ndeep sea fish farming.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, my next topic is on deep sea fish\r\n\r\nfarming.   I must commend the Ministry for conducting the  pilot\r\n\r\nstudy  on  deep  sea fish farming recently.  In resource  scarce\r\n\r\nSingapore where most of our food supplies are imported, there is\r\n\r\na  constant  need to search for alternative food sources.   Deep\r\n\r\nsea  fish  farming provides an innovative way for  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nbreed  fish  for local consumption.  I hope the Government  will\r\n\r\nprovide   more  support  to  develop  this  industry   as   fish\r\n\r\nconsumption is growing rapidly among Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a number of concerns which I hope the\r\n\r\nMinistry will address and they are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Experiences in British Columbia and Canada have shown\r\n\r\nthat salmon aquaculture farm have been the centre of controversy\r\n\r\nfor  many years.  These farms have been blamed for environmental\r\n\r\ndegradation and disruption to wild life in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  ocean.  The problems associated with open caged aquaculture\r\n\r\ninclude  faecal  pollution, release of dangerous pathogens  into\r\n\r\nthe  marine environment and disruption in the spawning  patterns\r\n\r\nof native salmon.  Recently, I met a professor from Finland.  He\r\n\r\ntold  me  that  the Ministry in Finland has recently  asked  all\r\n\r\nschool  children  to boycott the purchase of salmon  to  protest\r\n\r\nagainst   the   uncontrollable  pollution  caused   by   private\r\n\r\naquaculture farms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Another report from Vancouver highlighted the spread of\r\n\r\nvirulent disease by salmon fish farms.  It attributed the spread\r\n\r\nof  this disease to the netcage system which usually fills  high\r\n\r\ndensities of farm fish.  The jammed and stressful conditions  of\r\n\r\nthese  netcages  become potential breeding grounds  for  disease\r\n\r\nepidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am no expert in aquaculture, I hope my feedback\r\n\r\nwould help the Ministry to ensure that deep-sea fish farming  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is both safe and environmentally friendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nupdate  this House on the intended corporatisation of the Public\r\n\r\nWorks Department.  There is some concern from the private sector\r\n\r\nthat  the PWD, after corporatisation,  will compete for projects\r\n\r\nwith the private sector.   The PWD, given its size and technical\r\n\r\nexpertise  built  up  over many years,  should  focus  on  large\r\n\r\ninfrastructure   projects   in  Singapore.    It   should   also\r\n\r\nregionalise  to  take  advantage of its  brand  name  and  track\r\n\r\nrecord.  It should also consider helping our local building  and\r\n\r\nconstruction  companies to go into the region.  As Singapore  is\r\n\r\nsuch a small nation with limited resources, we should be careful\r\n\r\nnot  to  engage  in wasteful competition, but  leverage  on  one\r\n\r\nanother's skills and competitive advantage to get ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I propose to take the questions on\r\n\r\nrentals of HDB commercial premises and the redevelopment of  HDB\r\n\r\nindustrial estates.

Now,\r\n\r\nmore than two-thirds of HDB shops have been sold.  HDB does  not\r\n\r\nrent out any more shops except for small neighbourhood complexes\r\n\r\nin  the new towns.  Mr Tay Beng Chuan pointed out that the  rate\r\n\r\nof  return on HDB's commercial property department has  improved\r\n\r\nover the years.  This is so because the more you get rid of  the\r\n\r\nshops,  the better your performance.  The HDB shops are  heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised.   So, once you sell away two-thirds  of  the  shops,\r\n\r\nyour performance improves.  When we sell away all the shops, the\r\n\r\nperformance will be even greater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, we announced several measures to\r\n\r\nhelp the HDB shop tenants.  As you know, in many HDB shops,  the\r\n\r\nrents are far below market rents, and we have this programme  of\r\n\r\nmoving  the  rents  up to market rents at the third  renewal  of\r\n\r\ntheir  tenancies.   In November last year, we announced  further\r\n\r\nmoderation of this adjustment.  But we have to do so because  it\r\n\r\nis  very  inequitable.  In the same row of shops, you will  have\r\n\r\none  shopowner  who tendered for a HDB shop recently and he will\r\n\r\nbe  paying  the market rent of $2,500 per month.  Next  to  him,\r\n\r\nthere will be somebody who has been resettled several years  ago\r\n\r\nand  even though his rent has been moving up by 30% every  three\r\n\r\nyears  -  he started from a very low base of $300 -  now  he  is\r\n\r\nperhaps paying $600.  So I think it is not fair to continue with\r\n\r\nthis situation.   And it is in our interest to move things to  a\r\n\r\nmore  equal  level playing field and adjust the rents.   But  we\r\n\r\nacknowledge that during this period of economic difficulties, we\r\n\r\nshould moderate this increase, but we must adjust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another feature is that with two-thirds of our shops sold,\r\n\r\nin  fact, any shopkeeper who feels that HDB rentals are too high\r\n\r\ncan  easily  rent  a shop from the two-thirds who  have  already\r\n\r\nbought their shops.  If we look at the classified advertisements\r\n\r\nin  the Straits Times and the Chinese papers, we will find  many\r\n\r\nadvertisements of shops put out for rent by shopkeepers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  have already bought their shops from the HDB.  In fact, the\r\n\r\nmarket  rent is now set by shopkeepers who own their  shops  and\r\n\r\nwho are now renting or sub-letting their shops.  So HDB does not\r\n\r\nset  the market price.  Two-thirds of the shops are now sold and\r\n\r\nthis is the group that is now setting the market price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the November announcement, we decided on a\r\n\r\none-time  exercise to adjust the rents downwards to  the  market\r\n\r\nrent.   As  you know, in HDB tenancies, we will keep  the  rents\r\n\r\nfrozen  for three years and then adjust it at the end of the  3-year tenancy.  We could have kept the rent at current levels and\r\n\r\nthen  adjust the rent downwards at the end of the 3-year tenancy\r\n\r\nwhen the rent is due for renewal.  By December, we decided on  a\r\n\r\none-time  exercise to adjust all the rents down  to  the  market\r\n\r\nrent,  subject  to  a maximum of 10% drop.  So,  based  on  this\r\n\r\nannouncement in November, as of today, 2,380 commercial  tenants\r\n\r\nand  2,472  industrial tenants have benefitted from  the  rental\r\n\r\nconcessions introduced in December 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike what Mr Tay Beng Chuan has said, I think HDB has\r\n\r\ndone more than its fair share to help the shop tenants ease over\r\n\r\nduring this period.   Again, I can reiterate what Dr Richard  Hu\r\n\r\nsaid, if the situation worsens, he is prepared to consider other\r\n\r\noff-Budget measures to assist the SMEs even further.  So I think\r\n\r\nyou  will not find a more sympathetic landlord than the HDB with\r\n\r\nregard to HDB shops and the industrial shops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the redevelopment of HDB industrial\r\n\r\nestates.   I agree with Dr Ker and Mr Lew Syn Pau that  the  HDB\r\n\r\nindustrial  estates are very old.  Some of them were built  more\r\n\r\nthan  20  years ago and sorely need redevelopment or  upgrading.\r\n\r\nHDB  has  about 10,600 industrial premises under its management.\r\n\r\nAbout  55%  are  single storey terrace workshops  built  in  the\r\n\r\n1970s.   The remainder are high-rise industrial shops which  are\r\n\r\nabout 15 years old.  The House has heard the various problems in\r\n\r\nthe   industrial  estates.   They  were  built  with  inadequate\r\n\r\nelectrical loading to meet present needs.  The parking situation\r\n\r\nis tight because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMEs  now  use  low  loaders.  They use container  trucks.   The\r\n\r\nindustrial  estates  were not designed for  such  heavy  vehicle\r\n\r\nmovement.    Therefore,  last  year,  HDB  announced   a   major\r\n\r\nredevelopment programme for its industrial estates.  The purpose\r\n\r\nof  this redevelopment is two-fold: (1) to optimise the  use  of\r\n\r\nthese  sites to build it high-rise, greater intensity so  as  to\r\n\r\noptimise  land  use; and (2) to provide better  facilities  that\r\n\r\nwill   meet  the  operational  requirements  of  the  industrial\r\n\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This redevelopment is necessary and long overdue. I know\r\n\r\nmany  SME tenants will argue that during this difficult  period,\r\n\r\nthis will cause a disruption.  But no time is a good time.  When\r\n\r\nbusiness  is  good,  they will say, \"Don't  disturb  me.   I  am\r\n\r\nrushing to fulfill my orders.\"  When business is bad, they  say,\r\n\r\n\"Don't disturb me.  I can't afford to be going to new premises.\"\r\n\r\nIf  we  do  not  do  anything, the premises do  not  meet  their\r\n\r\nrequirement  and,  over  time,  they  will  be  less  and   less\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think we must press ahead with the HDB industrial\r\n\r\nredevelopment.   What  we  will do  is  to  incorporate  certain\r\n\r\nfeatures  that  will help ease them over to these new  premises.\r\n\r\nFirst  of  all,  for  every trade, we  set  up  a  committee  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the requirements of the individual trade.   The  food\r\n\r\nindustry  is  different from the motor  car  workshops.   It  is\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  the light electronics.  So we  have  committees\r\n\r\nwhich  will look into the needs of each trade, so that  when  we\r\n\r\nredesign  and redevelop the industrial premises, they will  meet\r\n\r\nthe needs of each trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with this redevelopment, we will also provide the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to rehouse the tenants from closely related  trades\r\n\r\nwithin  the  same  industrial complex for better  synergy.   The\r\n\r\npremises  will be bigger.  There will be higher ceiling heights,\r\n\r\nhigher  electrical loads and, therefore, better attuned  to  the\r\n\r\nmodern  needs of our SMEs.  As far as possible, the  replacement\r\n\r\nunits  built  by HDB will be located within the same  estate  to\r\n\r\nminimise the loss of business goodwill and workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tenants who are affected by relocation, I take Mr Lew\r\n\r\nSyn Pau's point.  We\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  give  them  ample notice to minimise disruption  to  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  operations.   Industrial  tenants  affected  by   this\r\n\r\nrelocation  will be given an ex-gratia compensation  of  $48,000\r\n\r\nper  unit.  They are also given an option to either purchase  or\r\n\r\nrent  the  replacement units.  Purchasing, of course, will  free\r\n\r\nthe  tenants from uncertainty in rent review.  HDB will  try  to\r\n\r\nkeep  the  prices  at affordable levels by  selling  them  at  a\r\n\r\nshorter  lease  period of 30 years.  Singapore  citizen  tenants\r\n\r\nwill be given a 5% discount of the market price.  For industrial\r\n\r\ntenants who opt to rent the units, they will continue to pay the\r\n\r\nexisting  rental  rates  on a per square  metre  basis  for  the\r\n\r\nremaining  term  of their existing tenancies.   They  will  also\r\n\r\nenjoy  a two-month rent- free fitting up period.  This rent-free\r\n\r\nfitting  up period will be extended to six months for  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen tenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these programmes in place, together with the\r\n\r\nassistance and the financial schemes offered by the Productivity\r\n\r\nand  Standards  Board  for local SMEs, I am  sure  we  can  work\r\n\r\nclosely together to make sure this redevelopment programme  meet\r\n\r\ntheir needs and puts them on a more competitive footing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the next set of questions raised by Dr Toh\r\n\r\nSee  Kiat,  Mr  Lew  Syn  Pau and Dr Teo on  licensing,  central\r\n\r\nregulatory  body  and  Ministry  of  Construction.   My  general\r\n\r\ncomment to all these points is that there is a standing joke  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service that whenever you get a Minister  or  a  new\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary, to create a sense of change, you centralise\r\n\r\nif  the  previous  administration had  decentralised.   And  you\r\n\r\ndecentralise if the previous administration had centralised.  So\r\n\r\nthere  is this fad of moving in the spectrum.  This also happens\r\n\r\nin the private sector.  You have conglomerates.  Then, in recent\r\n\r\nyears,  everybody has downsized, core competence,  sub-contract.\r\n\r\nNow, you are back to mergers and acquisitions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to go into the merits or demerits of\r\n\r\ncentralisation  or decentralisation.  I just want  to  make  the\r\n\r\npoint  that we have arrived at where we are.  We do not  have  a\r\n\r\none-stop  service  for  all  the  building  regulations,  first,\r\n\r\nbecause it is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npractical.  You have a super-mega Ministry.  I have no  interest\r\n\r\nin  heading  such  a  Ministry.  It is impractical  because  the\r\n\r\nregulatory  expertise  lies  in  different  Ministries  and   in\r\n\r\ndifferent professionals.  So it is not possible to put them  all\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we try to do, of course, is to use IT to overcome some\r\n\r\nof  these problems.  With the setting up of CoreNet and other IT\r\n\r\napplications, you are virtually dealing with a one-stop service,\r\n\r\nwithout physically and administratively putting everybody in one\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take Dr Teo's point about the merits of a Ministry of\r\n\r\nConstruction.   Again, personally, I do not see  the  need.   We\r\n\r\nhave  CIDB  to  spearhead the requirements of  the  construction\r\n\r\nsector.   I share the same frustration with Dr Teo in  that  the\r\n\r\nconstruction sector is not improving in productivity as much  as\r\n\r\nwe  would  like  to,  but  we have different  groups  of  people\r\n\r\ntackling  this  issue  together with the Singapore  Contractors'\r\n\r\nAssociation.  I will be very happy to enlist the help of Dr  Teo\r\n\r\nin  many  of these committees, so that he can apply his  talents\r\n\r\ninto some of these issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for licensing of household services, basically the\r\n\r\nGovernment licenses or regulates only if there is a safety issue\r\n\r\ninvolved.  For example, Mr Goh Choon Kang very eloquently talked\r\n\r\nabout  the dangers posed by old air-conditioner units.  I  share\r\n\r\nhis  view,  and in this type of situation you will see  the  HDB\r\n\r\ngetting  more  involved in the act.  But it is not  possible  to\r\n\r\nlicense  good  service.  How do Singaporeans choose  the  motor-repair  workshop?   You do not license it,  you  let  the  Motor\r\n\r\nRepair  Association  self-regulate.  How do Singaporeans  choose\r\n\r\ntheir  own hair-dressers?  You do not regulate.  Service  levels\r\n\r\ncannot  be regulated.  So I sympathize entirely with Dr Toh  See\r\n\r\nKiat.   All  I  can  say is CASE is doing great  work.   Anytime\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  face such problems they are encouraged  to  go  to\r\n\r\nCASE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where they masquerade as HDB contractors, we will\r\n\r\ngo after them.  In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases  like, for example, the real estate agents, we  will  take\r\n\r\nsteps  to  educate  them.  HDB in fact runs afternoon  seminars,\r\n\r\nboth  in English and Mandarin, so that you need not go to a real\r\n\r\nestate  agent to sell your flat or to buy a resale flat.  Attend\r\n\r\nthese  seminars, free of charge, or you pay a  small  fee.   HDB\r\n\r\nwill take you through how to transact a resale flat and you  are\r\n\r\non your own.  So similarly for all the other household services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one suggestion that Dr Toh can take is to have term\r\n\r\ncontractors within your town councils and advertise  these  term\r\n\r\ncontractors as reliable contractors for your residents.  That is\r\n\r\none practical solution you can take to help your residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expansion of the jurisdiction of town councils, I am\r\n\r\nalso very reluctant to do so.  If Dr Toh can solicit the support\r\n\r\nof  more Members of this House, I would then consider it.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  it  is  a good idea to take over looking  after  the\r\n\r\ncommon property of private housing estates.  They are very  well\r\n\r\ntaken  care of through their own management corporation.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot see why you want the town councils to do extra work.  If  we\r\n\r\ndo  implement the upgrading of the common areas in  the  private\r\n\r\nhousing estates, we will find a mechanism by which there will be\r\n\r\na  Government  agency  to help the MP  or  the  Advisor  to  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organizations to implement the  programme.   But  it\r\n\r\nneed not necessarily be undertaken by the town councils.  So off-hand,  I would not support the expansion of the jurisdiction  of\r\n\r\ntown  councils  until I get more favourable support  from  other\r\n\r\nMembers because this will affect every Member in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask Mr Koo Tsai Kee to take the other questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment (Mr Koo Tsai Kee):  Sir, I refer to the question  by\r\n\r\nProf  Chin Tet Yung.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Minister and I share the plight of some of these\r\n\r\ndivorcees,  the  problems that have been raised by  the  Member.\r\n\r\nBut I think we have got to re-focus back on basics.  What is the\r\n\r\nmission of HDB?  What\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  their prime objective?  Their prime objective is to  provide\r\n\r\nsubsidized public housing for all Singaporeans who qualify,  but\r\n\r\nin  particular, with special emphasis for first-timers.   So  to\r\n\r\nthe  extent that HDB has provided HDB flats to the couple before\r\n\r\nthey  divorced, or even after they had divorced, you  find  that\r\n\r\nHDB  has done its primary job.  If HDB were to waive the 10-year\r\n\r\nembargo  for  divorcees, we risk slipping into  what  economists\r\n\r\ncall  \"moral hazard\", which is the story for the last  6  months\r\n\r\nsince  the crisis in Thailand broke out.  The problem the Member\r\n\r\nhas  raised is real and the Ministry will look into it.  But the\r\n\r\nproblem  is not as serious as he has raised because the divorced\r\n\r\ncouple  has  an HDB flat.  If they had lived in it for  5  years\r\n\r\nthey can sell it on the resale market.  The proceeds can be used\r\n\r\nto rent an apartment or a flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the divorced couple are very poor, in the case cited by\r\n\r\nProf  Chin - if the wife especially earns below $800  -  we  can\r\n\r\nlook  at the case sympathetically and HDB is prepared, on a case\r\n\r\nby  case basis, to waive the 30-month debarment.  When you  sell\r\n\r\nyour  flat  you have got to wait for 30 months to  apply  for  a\r\n\r\nrental flat.  If he or she is very poor, then we are prepared to\r\n\r\nlook   into  this  30-month  debarment,  provided  the  divorcee\r\n\r\nsatisfies all other rental conditions.  So I hope the Member  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with  the  answer.  If he  knows  of  any   specially\r\n\r\ndeserving  cases, he is welcome to write to me and we will  look\r\n\r\nat it specially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue raised by Dr Teo Ho Pin on HDB car parks, I\r\n\r\nhave  asked my officers to give me a report.  He tells  me  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  adequate car park lots provided in  semi-mature  HDB\r\n\r\nestates,  especially those since mid-1980s when the  norms  were\r\n\r\nfairly  generous.  In Bukit Panjang, where he  is  the  MP,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, the overall season parking rate is only about 60%.  So\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  real serious problem in Bukit Panjang.   However,\r\n\r\nthere could be local problems.  The problem is that some of  his\r\n\r\nresidents may be reluctant to go to a car park which is slightly\r\n\r\nfurther  away,  say 100-150 metres.  That is why  HDB  has  this\r\n\r\ngrouping  system  where we group a few car  parks  together  and\r\n\r\nencourage residents within the zone to share these car\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npark  spaces.  Just for Dr Teo's information, there are  34  HDB\r\n\r\ncar  parks comprising 11,866 lots in Bukit Panjang estate.   But\r\n\r\nthe only car park with localized shortage is car park group G20.\r\n\r\nI  am  not sure if he is referring to that, but that is the only\r\n\r\nlocalized shortage in the area.  About 5-6% of the residents are\r\n\r\nunable  to  purchase a season parking ticket for this  car  park\r\n\r\ngroup.  HDB will look into this special problem and will come up\r\n\r\nwith some solutions and will inform the MP in due time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue raised by Mr Ong Ah Heng on ceiling leak and\r\n\r\nspalling  concrete, first let me distinguish  between  the  two.\r\n\r\nSpalling  concrete  is considered a surface maintenance  defect.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  cost sharing between the upper  and  lower  floor\r\n\r\nlessees  for  spalling concrete within the flats as  it  is  the\r\n\r\nlessee's responsibility to repair them.  But I think Mr Ong  was\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the  ceiling  leakage  problem,  particularly  in\r\n\r\ntoilets.   Under  the  lease, as he  rightly  pointed  out,  the\r\n\r\nparties  sharing  the  use  of  a  party-structure  are  jointly\r\n\r\nresponsible for its maintenance.  Hence the affected  upper  and\r\n\r\nlower  lessees  are required to engage their own  contractor  to\r\n\r\nrectify the leaking problem and share the cost of repair  works.\r\n\r\nMr  Ong  is not disputing that this should be the case.   He  is\r\n\r\nasking  for  faster remedial action on the part of   HDB  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  he is appealing to HDB to apply some kind of pressure  on\r\n\r\nthe  tenants, the upper floor and lower tenants, to  settle  the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB on its part will assist lessees to diagnose and\r\n\r\ndetermine   the   cause  of  the  leakage  and  will   recommend\r\n\r\nappropriate remedial action.  As to the time lead,  I  will  ask\r\n\r\nHDB  to  look into the problem and see whether they can  shorten\r\n\r\nit.   But the problem is really not HDB.  The problem is  really\r\n\r\nthe  tenants, both on the upper floor and lower floor.  I  think\r\n\r\nthey should take joint responsibility.  They should realise that\r\n\r\nwhen   they  inhabit  the  flats  there  are  certain  ownership\r\n\r\nresponsibilities and this is one of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the problem is not very serious. In 1997, only about\r\n\r\n1%  out  of  11,000 ceiling leakage cases has such difficulties.\r\n\r\nIf the leakage is really very bad and affects the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstructural  integrity  of  the  building,  then  HDB  will  take\r\n\r\nimmediate  legal action to enter the premises to carry  out  the\r\n\r\nrepair and recover the cost from the lessees.  This action will,\r\n\r\nas  the MP will appreciate, only be carried out as a last resort\r\n\r\nbecause this is a very drastic action and we respect the  rights\r\n\r\nof   the  owners.   Indeed  this  is  practised  widely  in  the\r\n\r\ncondominiums where the MC will refrain from interfering  in  the\r\n\r\nproblem of the upper and lower floor neighbours.  They will only\r\n\r\ngo in when the problem becomes acute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Transitional Rental Housing Scheme (TRHS), my friend and\r\n\r\nMP,  Mr  Sinnakaruppan,  has brought  out  this  problem.   TRHS\r\n\r\nexercises  are conducted quarterly, every three months.   First-timer  applicants  who  have been on the Registration  of  Flats\r\n\r\nSystem (RFS) for at least three months are eligible to apply for\r\n\r\nTRHS  flats.  I have been told that if you applied  for  a  flat\r\n\r\nbefore  July  last  year then you qualify to go  into  the  TRHS\r\n\r\nexercise in January in the next quarter.  Applicants who are not\r\n\r\nshortlisted  are nonetheless placed on the reserve list  and  if\r\n\r\nthere  are  rejected flats then we will ask the  people  on  the\r\n\r\nreserve list to select one of these rejected flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked how fast people who have been invited to\r\n\r\nselect  TRHS flat can get the flats.  In fact, if the applicants\r\n\r\nare  not  choosy, they can get it very quickly because over  the\r\n\r\nlast  year, HDB has increased both the supply and moderated  the\r\n\r\ndemand.   He mentioned some of the supply modifications HDB  has\r\n\r\nmade.  HDB has bought more 3-room flats from the open market for\r\n\r\nTRHS  applicants.   We  have offered 1-  and  2-room  flats  for\r\n\r\nselection,  in addition to 3-room flats.  But very  importantly,\r\n\r\nwe  have also opened a category called \"Flat Sharing\".   I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Member is aware of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If somebody comes to your MPS and says he needs a flat very\r\n\r\nurgently  because  his wife is pregnant or his mother-in-law  is\r\n\r\nhaving problems with him, then we tell him that there is a group\r\n\r\nof  flats  called  the \"Flat Sharing Scheme\",  where  if  he  is\r\n\r\nwilling to share a flat with somebody else\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  pay  half the rental and share half the responsibility,  he\r\n\r\ncan  get  the  flat  almost immediately.  In  fact,  I  can  say\r\n\r\nimmediately, because the drop-out rate is very high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the January TRHS exercise, we offered 600\r\n\r\nflats  -   500 flats for non-sharing and 100 flats for  sharing.\r\n\r\nWe  invited 1,233 applicants to select these flats.  Out of  the\r\n\r\n500 applicants selected to pick the TRHS flats, we find that 196\r\n\r\nrejected  the flat.  In other words, I offer you a flat,  I  say\r\n\r\n\"If  you want, there you are.\"  You say \"I don't want because  I\r\n\r\nwant a better area or I want a better height.\"  So it is not on.\r\n\r\nEven for this group of flats, with assured allocation, the fall-out  rate  is  very  high, almost 20%.  For the  100  flats  for\r\n\r\nsharing  purpose, eight took up the offer.  So 92 flats went  a-begging.   For  people  who  really want  a  flat  urgently  for\r\n\r\nwhatever reasons, my answer to the MP is, if they are not choosy\r\n\r\nabout  location, if they are not choosy, if they not  too  picky\r\n\r\nabout privacy, they can get it immediately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go to the problem raised by Mr Chay Wai Chuen. I think\r\n\r\nhe  is  quite  right.   As  a rule, URA  does  not  approve  any\r\n\r\nindependent  retail space in industrial or warehouse development\r\n\r\nfor  retail  purposes  for  the  reasons  pointed  out  by  him.\r\n\r\nHowever,  showrooms are allowed within the 40% floor area  which\r\n\r\ncan  be  used for ancillary purposes like office and  cafeteria.\r\n\r\nShowrooms  are  restricted only to the  first  storey  level  of\r\n\r\nindustrial or warehouse developments fronting major roads.   URA\r\n\r\nwill continue to take enforcement action on unauthorized use  of\r\n\r\nindustrial or warehouse space for independent retail activities.\r\n\r\nThere  are  a few in town.  We will look at them and  regularise\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo raised the issue of cost reduction for public\r\n\r\nprojects.  First of all, I would like to thank him for giving us\r\n\r\nvery good ideas.   On design-and-build tenders, he suggests that\r\n\r\nall Government departments should follow HDB's practice.  I want\r\n\r\nto  thank him for complimenting HDB.  This problem has also been\r\n\r\nhighlighted  in  the  Ministry's  dialogue  with  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nContractors  Association Limited.  They have raised the  problem\r\n\r\nthat it is very expensive for contractors to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngo  for design-and-build projects one after another if they fail\r\n\r\nin  a few of them.  So we will look into how we can minimise the\r\n\r\ncost  for contractors,  because we want to encourage contractors\r\n\r\nto  go  for  design-and-build.  This is what Singaporeans  want.\r\n\r\nThey are prepared to pay a premium for design-and-build flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also suggested that all Government departments should\r\n\r\nadopt  HDB's approach in purchasing basic building materials  in\r\n\r\nbulk  for contractors working in their projects.  This is  going\r\n\r\nto  be  very  difficult.  I think it is  not  possible  for  all\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments because none of them have  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nvolume  of  building programme, like the HDB's.  Certainly  not,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  Ministry  of Labour; certainly  not  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.  They build schools but they are not building in  the\r\n\r\nvolume that HDB is building flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of Clerks-of-Works and Professional Engineers\r\n\r\n(PEs)  has  also  been  highlighted by SCAL.   The  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nlooking   into   how  we  can  ameliorate  the  problem.    But,\r\n\r\nessentially,  the problem must be solved by the contractors  and\r\n\r\nthe  developers.   It  is a developer and contractor's  problem.\r\n\r\nSome  Clerks-of-Works are demanding, for example, concreting  at\r\n\r\nnight,  thereby jacking up the cost for contractors and creating\r\n\r\nnoise for residents.  The contractors are very welcome to file a\r\n\r\ncomplaint to BCD, CIDB or to the Ministry officials, and we will\r\n\r\nlook  at it.  But I understand that SCAL is reluctant to  finger\r\n\r\nClerks-of-Works who are corrupt in their mind and we have  asked\r\n\r\nSCAL that they must regularise.  We can only help them, but they\r\n\r\nmust  take  action on their part.  But, nonetheless, I  want  to\r\n\r\nassure the MPs that the Ministry is looking into this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On standardisation and modernisation, the Member encouraged\r\n\r\npublic   projects   to   adopt  pre-fab   components,   pre-cast\r\n\r\ncomponents, in order to speed up the construction process and to\r\n\r\nsave  construction cost.  This is being done extensively by HDB.\r\n\r\nHDB has a pre-fab technology centre.  I think the MP has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvisited  it.   For  public  projects, there  is  no  problem  in\r\n\r\nencouraging  contractors  to use standardised  components.   The\r\n\r\nproblem really lies in the private sector.  This is because most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   think   that  pre-fab  buildings   are   not   so\r\n\r\naesthetically  beautiful.  They prefer specially designed,  one-off  buildings.   Nonetheless, the Ministry is  aware  that  the\r\n\r\nproductivity  in the construction sector is rather  low  and  we\r\n\r\nthink  that one way to go about it is to encourage more  pre-fab\r\n\r\ncomponents.   Perhaps  in  the near future,  we  will  think  of\r\n\r\nlegislating buildable designs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On project financing, the MP made a few suggestions. He\r\n\r\nsaid  that Government should give initial payment, then,  timely\r\n\r\nprogress  payments,  and then early settlement  of  final  cost.\r\n\r\nInitial  payment is not possible.  The Government can  only  pay\r\n\r\nwhen something is being done, because we are dealing with public\r\n\r\nmoney.   We cannot pay the contract when no work is being  done.\r\n\r\nI notice sometimes it happens in the private sector.  But we are\r\n\r\ndealing  with public funds, so initial payment is not  possible.\r\n\r\nTimely  progress  payments, this is always done.   HDB  and  PWD\r\n\r\nalways make timely progress payments.  In fact, because HDB, PWD\r\n\r\nand  all the Government bodies are such good pay masters we  are\r\n\r\nseeing a flood of contracts recently.  Early settlement of final\r\n\r\naccounts,  this  is always done.  We always pay  promptly.   Our\r\n\r\nproblem  is  that we have to chase contractors to  finish  their\r\n\r\njobs early, not that we are delaying their payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs suggested providing housing for foreign workers. This\r\n\r\nis also a point raised by Mr Sinnakaruppan.  This point has also\r\n\r\nbeen  raised  by SCAL.  So we are looking into how we  can  help\r\n\r\ncontractors house foreign workers.  One possible way may  be  to\r\n\r\nallocate land to SCAL to build dormitory housing, but this is in\r\n\r\na  very initial stage, and I would let the MPs know more of  the\r\n\r\ndetails later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On disposal of construction wastes, the MP suggested\r\n\r\nemploying  term  contractors to clear all the debris  caused  by\r\n\r\nconstruction in zones.  Maybe in the western zone, you have  two\r\n\r\nterm contractors; the northern zone you have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree   term   contractors.   So  these  contractors   will   be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for clearing all the debris generated  by  all  the\r\n\r\nconstruction within the zone.  I think this is not very easy  to\r\n\r\nimplement.  But, nonetheless, I will ask the officials  to  look\r\n\r\nat  it.   Basically  we  do not know the volume  of  work  in  a\r\n\r\nparticular sector of Singapore, because some of this information\r\n\r\nare  time-sensitive.  So how do we call for contracts?   How  do\r\n\r\nterm contractors price their services?  Because they do not know\r\n\r\nthe volume of work that is coming down, and you cannot tell them\r\n\r\nthat  certain  activities will be started in  one  year  or  two\r\n\r\nyears' time.  These are price-sensitive information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan made a strong pitch for Government to\r\n\r\nregulate  the use of private residential properties as  boarding\r\n\r\nhouses.   For  the  whole  of 1997, URA received  979  cases  of\r\n\r\nunauthorised  use of residential premises as workers'  quarters.\r\n\r\nWhile  I  concede that this may be a low number, but if  Members\r\n\r\nknow  of  any  abuse  of residential units as  boarding  houses,\r\n\r\nplease  let  us  know.   URA has taken  enforcement  action  and\r\n\r\ncleared 895, or 91%, of the cases we know.  The remaining  cases\r\n\r\nare still under active enforcement.  As to the specific areas he\r\n\r\nmentioned  (Cambridge  Road, Sing Avenue, Joo  Avenue,  Carlisle\r\n\r\nRoad),  URA  is  particularly active because  the  MP  has  been\r\n\r\nparticularly  active in complaining, and that is good  for  him.\r\n\r\nThe  URA  has sent 26 warning letters to the persons responsible\r\n\r\nto  cease  the use.  I think they have ceased.  Six  cases  have\r\n\r\ncomplied, and enforcement notices will be served on the rest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we solve the foreign worker problem? This is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  everybody  must put  their  mind  to,  but,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, the people who employ foreign workers.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nthe   Government's  job  to  employ  foreign  workers.   It   is\r\n\r\nGovernment's job to house Singaporeans, and already  we  have  a\r\n\r\nheadache.  I think we cannot be encumbered with trying to  solve\r\n\r\nhousing  for foreign workers.  But it is a problem.  So  HDB  is\r\n\r\nassisting in whatever way it can.  But it is not HDB's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem.   HDB is extending its goodwill and trying to  solve  a\r\n\r\nproblem  that  has infected the whole of Singapore,  because  we\r\n\r\nhave  too many foreign workers, and Members are complaining that\r\n\r\nthe foreigner workers levy is too heavy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to solve the problem is to allocate land for\r\n\r\ndormitory  housing.  The MP has alluded to that.  JTC will  also\r\n\r\nbe  able  to buy HDB flats to rent out to foreign workers.   MPs\r\n\r\nraised a point that the Planning Act does not specify the number\r\n\r\nof  persons that can live in a house.  That is correct.  Because\r\n\r\nthese are private houses and some of them have large families (3-generation  or  4-generation families).  So  we  cannot  take  a\r\n\r\nparticular  number.   But some numbers are obviously  irregular.\r\n\r\nFor  example, if a house has 100 workers, of course, it is  used\r\n\r\nas  a  boarding house.  If a house has 30 workers, I think, then\r\n\r\nstraightaway, we will know that that house is likely to be  used\r\n\r\nas  a  boarding  house.  So although there  is  no  number,  the\r\n\r\nmagnitude  of  the number, a reasonable number, is a  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat a particular house is used as a boarding house.  So if  the\r\n\r\nnumber is, say, 10 to 15, please let us know.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> 30 to 40.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Definitely it is used as a boarding house.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have no numbers for a private home owner on how\r\n\r\nmany  people  he can rent out to, we have some numbers  for  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.   For  example, JTC flats which are used to rent  out  to\r\n\r\nworkers,  it  says that for 3-room flats, we do not  allow  more\r\n\r\nthan  10 workers in a 3-room flat; in a 4-room flat, we  do  not\r\n\r\nallow more than12 workers.  For the dormitory housing scheme, we\r\n\r\nhave  certain  norms.   In a 1-room, maximum  six  occupiers;  2\r\n\r\nrooms,  maximum eight occupiers; 3-room, 10 occupiers; 4  and  5\r\n\r\nrooms, maximum 12 occupiers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I urge the Member to be a bit tolerant about the\r\n\r\nforeign  worker  housing situation.  Because these  workers  are\r\n\r\nhere  to contribute to Singapore's economy and they are not like\r\n\r\nwhat  the  MP  said,  prisoners housed in  worse  conditions  in\r\n\r\nprisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On old air-conditioning units in high-rise buildings, Mr\r\n\r\nGoh Choon Kang has pointed out the problem.  Currently, HDB flat\r\n\r\nowners  must obtain HDB's approval before they can install  air-conditioners.   If the air-conditioner has been mounted  on  the\r\n\r\nexterior  of  the  flat,  flat owners are  required,  under  the\r\n\r\nBuilding Control Act, to engage a CIDB trained installer.   This\r\n\r\nwas  done  last  year.   So  we  are  moving  one  step  towards\r\n\r\nregulating the installation of air-conditioners.  And  over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  HDB  has  also  taken measures  to  further  secure  the\r\n\r\ninstallation   of  air-conditioners.   Since   1990,   all   the\r\n\r\nsupporting brackets for new installation of air-conditioners are\r\n\r\nto  be  made  of  stainless steel which  is  more  resistant  to\r\n\r\ncorrosion  than the former mild steel brackets.   In  1992,  HDB\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  service balcony for flat owners  to  place  the\r\n\r\ncondensers  of  split  air-conditioned  units.   In  1995,   HDB\r\n\r\ndesigned  the recess laundry area where a ledge with railing  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  flat  owners  to  place  their  condensers.   The\r\n\r\nprovision of such a ledge further prevents air-conditioners from\r\n\r\nfalling.  So these are various measures that are in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all these will come to naught if the flat owners\r\n\r\ndo   not   take  ownership  and  responsibility  for  the   air-conditioners.  Ultimately, it is the flat owner's responsibility\r\n\r\nto check and ensure that the air-conditioners and the supporting\r\n\r\nstructures are in good condition.  In 1994, HDB sent out letters\r\n\r\nto  remind flat owners that they are responsible for checking on\r\n\r\nthe  air-conditioners and to maintain them in good condition  at\r\n\r\nall  times.   So  HDB  has done its job.  We have  reminded  the\r\n\r\nowners.   Very often, the owners ignore.  In addition,  HDB  has\r\n\r\nadvised  flat  owners  how to go about  maintaining  their  air-conditioners.   And HDB will continue to advise flat  owners  to\r\n\r\ntake immediate action if they spot any air-conditioners that are\r\n\r\nnot properly maintained during the inspection round.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from the incident highlighted by the Member, the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control Division of PWD will look into the possibility\r\n\r\nof legislating the requirement for window air-conditioning units\r\n\r\ninstalled in high-rise buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to Dr Teo Ho Pin's comments on construction\r\n\r\ndispute resolution.  I want to thank him for the many ideas that\r\n\r\nhe has given us.  I want to say that the Government supports the\r\n\r\nMember's  suggestion and will encourage the use of the mediation\r\n\r\nprocess  to  settle construction-related disputes,  because  the\r\n\r\nprocess  is  less costly, not adversarial, and takes  less  time\r\n\r\nthan  arbitration.   Moreover, the cordial relationship  between\r\n\r\nthe  two parties is also retained, so that the construction work\r\n\r\ncan progress quickly to completion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the CIDB, together with HDB and PWD, is currently\r\n\r\nfinalising  the  mediation clause to  be  included  into  public\r\n\r\nsector  conditions of contract.  But Dr Teo wants us to  go  one\r\n\r\nstep  further.  He wants us to put this clause in all Government\r\n\r\nland  sales.  I think this is not possible.  We do not  want  to\r\n\r\nencumber  the prospective buyer with more and more clauses.   If\r\n\r\nthe developer is enlightened, he will encourage mediation and he\r\n\r\nwill  look  for a contractor who is pro-mediation.  So  I  think\r\n\r\nputting  the  clause in land sale is unwise.  Nonetheless,  CIDB\r\n\r\nwill  work  with REDAS and the Singapore Institute of Architects\r\n\r\nto   have   similar  clauses  for  private  sector  construction\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised several points in his speech. He wants grants\r\n\r\nfor  construction- related personnel to understand  the  use  of\r\n\r\nmediation.  I ask him to lobby the Minister for Finance and  the\r\n\r\nMinster  for Trade and Industry.  He hopes to have more  support\r\n\r\nfor the SMC.  CIDB will work closely with SMC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo went on to the next topic - landscaping along roads\r\n\r\nand  expressways.   I  think,  first,  we  must  settle  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  issue here.  The National Parks Board does  not  want\r\n\r\nthe  central dividers there.  The central dividers are there for\r\n\r\na very important reason, and that reason is safety.  The primary\r\n\r\npurpose  of  central dividers along expressways and other  major\r\n\r\nmulti-lane  roads  is to separate opposing streams  of  traffic.\r\n\r\nThey travel at high speeds.  So if there is a head-on collision,\r\n\r\nit  will  be  a serious accident.  The provision of the  central\r\n\r\ndividers is necessary to prevent head-on collision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  reckless  overtaking.   This  will  ensure  the  safety  of\r\n\r\ndrivers.  Since the central dividers are there, we might as well\r\n\r\nmake  good  use  of them.  And that is where the National  Parks\r\n\r\ncame  in.   The  National Parks Board came in to  green  up  the\r\n\r\ncentral   dividers   for  the  pleasure  of  all   Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  earned the reputation as  being  a  Garden  City\r\n\r\nmostly because of its kerb side greenery.  So you will find that\r\n\r\nthe  idea to remove plants, flowers and trees along the  central\r\n\r\ndivider will not go down well with most Singaporeans.  The  tree\r\n\r\nplanting along the central dividers softens the harshness of the\r\n\r\nconcrete jungle that we live in.  I am sure that many members of\r\n\r\nthe  public who drive along the ECP and AYE will enjoy the  cool\r\n\r\ncomfort  provided  by the trees.  But, of course,  the  National\r\n\r\nParks is aware of the points raised by Dr Teo and they are  very\r\n\r\nmindful of the safety aspects in maintaining the greenery  along\r\n\r\nmajor roads and expressways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, National Parks has worked very closely\r\n\r\nwith  LTA.  It is not just a problem of National Parks.   It  is\r\n\r\nalso a problem of LTA.  We are working on roads and the National\r\n\r\nParks  is taking the prescribed measures of public safety.   The\r\n\r\nNational  Parks  will  continue to enhance the  safety  measures\r\n\r\nwhere possible and viable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo raised the point that the fitting of a truck mounted\r\n\r\nattenuator (TMA) actually encourages vehicles to crash on to it.\r\n\r\nThis  is an exaggeration, to put it mildly.  The fitting of  TMA\r\n\r\nwill  not eradicate the hazard but it does minimise the loss  of\r\n\r\nlives when the time comes, hopefully, never.  National Parks has\r\n\r\nstrict  criteria on when to water the plants along  the  central\r\n\r\ndivider  and  how  to  water  them.   For  stationary  vehicles,\r\n\r\nNational Parks staff and contractors are required to comply with\r\n\r\na whole set of provisions, for example, they have to place cones\r\n\r\nand  make  sure  that  the yellow arrows  are  lighted.   It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for the watering vehicles to be mobile to  water  the\r\n\r\ncentral divider plants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand we do so during non-peak hours.  So it is unlikely that such\r\n\r\nwatering routine will cause traffic jams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo seems to forget that accidents can be caused by both\r\n\r\nparties.  So it is also pertinent to remind all of us that  when\r\n\r\nwe  travel  on  the highways, we should be on the look  out  for\r\n\r\nstationary vehicles, especially those with cones behind them and\r\n\r\nbig  yellow arrows flashing about.  We should also adhere to the\r\n\r\nsafe  speed limit.  If these conditions are observed by  all  of\r\n\r\nus,  I  think there should be very, very few accidents involving\r\n\r\nNational Parks watering trucks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On deep sea fishing, I think Dr Teo might have scared all\r\n\r\nthe  Teochews  about eating fish, and I remind  the  House  that\r\n\r\nthere  are many Teochews in the Cabinet.  Here, I would like  to\r\n\r\nreassure  the House that the fears are unfounded.   So  you  can\r\n\r\ncarry  on eating fish.  Our deep netcage fish farms are designed\r\n\r\nbased  on  the  Norwegians' 20 years' experience.  He  mentioned\r\n\r\nabout  the  Canadian experience.  Fortunately, we do  not  model\r\n\r\nafter  the Canadian.  We knew the problem.  So we went to Norway\r\n\r\nand also Greece.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Norwegian fish farming technique is so\r\n\r\nadvanced.  They have leapfrogged from a minor salmon breeder  to\r\n\r\na  major salmon exporter.  In fact, most of the salmons you find\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, in NTUC Fairprice, come from Norway.   And  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that you will enjoy the taste.  There is no problem.   The\r\n\r\nexperience  of  British  Columbia in  Canada  is  therefore  not\r\n\r\nrelevant to us and I will explain why later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our deep sea netcages are sited off St John's\r\n\r\nIsland in deep open waters.  The waste built up within the  cage\r\n\r\ncan  be readily dispersed in the open sea by the currents.   The\r\n\r\nwater  depth  in  the  area where we put the  deep  sea  netcage\r\n\r\nexceeds  10  metres and the currents there exceed 1  knot.   The\r\n\r\nnetcages   are  spaced  out  quite  evenly  apart   to   prevent\r\n\r\novercrowding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Columbian problem came about because they put\r\n\r\nthe aquaculture netcages along the migratory path of the salmon,\r\n\r\nespecially in the mouth of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrivers  where the salmons return to spawn annually.  So that  is\r\n\r\nthe  reason, because you disrupted their mating habits and their\r\n\r\nmigratory  patterns.   And I have been told  that  although  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Columbian  problem  may be real,  in  the  Scandinavian\r\n\r\ncountries,  they  have  no  such problems.   Intensive  farming,\r\n\r\nwhether it is fish stock, chickens or pigs, comes with a  higher\r\n\r\nrisk  of diseases.  However, with good veterinarians in the PPD,\r\n\r\ngood  disease  control  techniques,  good  management  and  good\r\n\r\nvaccines,  I  think  the  problem  can  be  minimised,  if   not\r\n\r\neradicated altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On corporatisation of PWD, the last topic raised in the\r\n\r\nseries  of cuts by Mr Lew Syn Pau, PWD Corporation is likely  to\r\n\r\nbe  corporatised or privatised next year.  And I want to  assure\r\n\r\nthe  Member  that his suggestion will be taken up, namely,  that\r\n\r\nPWD Corporation will cooperate with private sector architectural\r\n\r\ncompanies,   engineering   companies   and   quantity   surveyor\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Of course, PWD Corporation must also  compete  with\r\n\r\nthem  and provide a benchmark for an integrated engineering  and\r\n\r\narchitectural  services  to  take  on  regional  infrastructural\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why corporatise? Because the corporatisation of PWD will\r\n\r\nallow  a  leaner  and  trimmer  Government  to  concentrate   on\r\n\r\ndelivering  essential public services, such  as  regulatory  and\r\n\r\nplanning functions.  So we will keep the regulatory arm  of  PWD\r\n\r\nwhich  is the BCD.  We believe that the PWD Corporation will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  set  new  standards of engineering  and  architectural\r\n\r\nexcellence in Singapore after corporatisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, a point of clarification. Mr Lim\r\n\r\nsaid  in his reply that the management corporation's work should\r\n\r\nnot  be taken over.  I do agree.  But in my examples, they  were\r\n\r\nall   public  facilities.   Management  corporations  deal  with\r\n\r\nprivate facilities.  If the Minister is agreeable that upgrading\r\n\r\nwill  be done, my question is: why not town councils?  I do  not\r\n\r\nexpect  to persuade the Minister immediately.  But I think  some\r\n\r\nthought should be planted.  I would also thank the Minister  for\r\n\r\npraising  the good work CASE has done on a peanut  budget.   Now\r\n\r\nthat he has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassed  the buck back to CASE, perhaps, he would like to move  a\r\n\r\nfew hundred thousand bucks our way too.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, just a few points of clarification.\r\n\r\nOne, I am surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary has got the\r\n\r\nfigure  from his officer about the 60% season parking  in  Bukit\r\n\r\nPanjang.  They must have included a lot of new multi-storey  car\r\n\r\nparks  where  the  residents have not moved in.   Because  three\r\n\r\nmonths  ago, I went there and noticed that about 90% of the  car\r\n\r\nparks  were  all taken up.  But the Parliamentary Secretary  has\r\n\r\nnot  answered my suggestions concerning the equalisation of  car\r\n\r\npark fees and converting the unused land space to car parks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on bulk materials. What I mean is that\r\n\r\nHDB  is doing a good job.  But can the other Ministries also tap\r\n\r\non  HDB's  bulk  purchase of materials, that  is,  MOE  can  buy\r\n\r\nconcrete  or sand from HDB?  So the contractors can  reduce  the\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about the central dividers. I know there\r\n\r\nis  a  need for a central divider.  What I am trying to  say  is\r\n\r\nthat  you may not need to landscape the central divider heavily.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to maintain those trees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is on deep sea fishing. I know the method\r\n\r\nused in Singapore is different.  But if you put 30,000 fishes in\r\n\r\none  cage,  it does not matter whether the current is strong  or\r\n\r\nnot,  because  the  faeces are still  polluting  the  sea.   The\r\n\r\ncurrent  is  not important at all because it will still  pollute\r\n\r\nSt. John's Island.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I thank the Member for giving me a\r\n\r\nchance  to clarify some of the points which I forgot to clarify.\r\n\r\nHe asked whether unused land space in semi-mature estates can be\r\n\r\nconverted to car park spaces.  I think it is not fair to convert\r\n\r\nempty land spaces in semi-mature estates to car parks unless  we\r\n\r\ncan  establish that there is a real shortage of car parks in the\r\n\r\ngrouping  system.  The reason is that most people in  the  semi-mature estates do not own cars.  So they enjoy the greenery, the\r\n\r\nspace  and  the  comfort of the openness.  If  you  block  their\r\n\r\nvisual comfort, they will come to you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  me  and  say,  \"You  block my  fong  shui.   You  block  my\r\n\r\ngeomancy.\"  There are cases like that which have come to me.  So\r\n\r\nmy  immediate  reaction is that we have got to be  very  careful\r\n\r\nabout  taking away open space and putting a concrete block there\r\n\r\nunless there is a real need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we need to plant so many different kind of plants\r\n\r\nalong  central  dividers, I do not think we  crowd  the  central\r\n\r\ndividers  with  too many hybrids of plants.  For a  very  simple\r\n\r\nreason,  if  you over plant, you will find that the plants  will\r\n\r\nnot  flourish.  We want to plant the optimum number so that  you\r\n\r\nwill get the most beautiful bloom.  I do not think there is over\r\n\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of bulk purchase and whether contractors\r\n\r\nfor  MINDEF or MOL projects can tap into HDB's supplier of  sand\r\n\r\nand  granite,  I  have got to ask HDB whether  they  have  spare\r\n\r\ncapacity or not.  My understanding is that HDB has a very  tight\r\n\r\nschedule  in  completing all the HDB flats for so  many  people.\r\n\r\nRight  now, we have something like 130,000 people on the waiting\r\n\r\nlist.  So I think HDB's first priority is to build the flats for\r\n\r\npeople  in  the queue.  Contractors working on MOL  projects  or\r\n\r\nMINDEF  projects  are usually working on smaller  projects  like\r\n\r\nbuilding  an  army camp or a small building.  So they  can  take\r\n\r\ncare  of  the  construction materials  themselves.   As  HDB  is\r\n\r\ndealing  with  something like 30,000 flats  a  year,  its  first\r\n\r\npriority must be to protect the construction materials  for  its\r\n\r\ncore contractors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On deep sea fishing, so far, we have not detected any\r\n\r\ndiseases in the fish that are growing off St John's Island.   In\r\n\r\nfact, during the last visit of the GPC, we heartily tucked  into\r\n\r\nsome  of  these                  (jin mu lu) fish  or  what  the\r\n\r\nAustralians call barracuda.  Dr Teo and I are still healthy.   I\r\n\r\nthink the problem is not so serious.  It is not real.  I do  not\r\n\r\nthink it is a problem here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister and the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary for their replies and I would  like  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Property  being  a  scarce\r\n\r\ncommodity tends to be very expensive.  However, because  of  the\r\n\r\nrecent   regional  financial   turmoil,   property   prices   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have dropped.  Even then, the prices are  still  very\r\n\r\nmuch  on the high side to the people in general.    This is  the\r\n\r\nrepresentative view of the majority of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the ordinary citizens of Singapore, owning a piece of\r\n\r\nproperty is one of the most important things in life.  Yet, when\r\n\r\none wants to buy or sell a property, he will have to turn to the\r\n\r\nhousing  agencies  for  help, as property transactions  are  too\r\n\r\ncomplicated a matter to be handled by the laymen themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the housing agency is good or bad makes a lot of\r\n\r\ndifference  to  the buyers and  sellers.  In my  meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsessions,  I  have  come across complaints against  bad  housing\r\n\r\nagencies  who  gave a lot of troubles to their clients,  causing\r\n\r\nthem  not  only lots of inconvenience but also monetary  losses.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I urge  the Government to provide some form of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassistance  and protection to the  general population  in  their\r\n\r\nproperty transactions.   We should consider how to organise  all\r\n\r\nthe  housing  agencies and put them together in  a  professional\r\n\r\nbody  or   association,  the objective  of  which  shall  be  to\r\n\r\nregulate  and  coordinate  the activities  of  its  professional\r\n\r\nmembers,  so  that  they  would  conduct  their  business   with\r\n\r\nprofessionalism, discipline and efficiency.   This  will  be  of\r\n\r\ngreat benefit to our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Ministry of National Development can play a\r\n\r\ngreater  role in this regard.  As it is, presently  all  housing\r\n\r\nagents have to  pass the CEHA  conducted by the tax authorities.\r\n\r\nOnly  on  passing  the said examination  can they  apply  for  a\r\n\r\nlicence  to practise as housing agents.  They can then  register\r\n\r\nwith   the  HDB  as  authorised  housing  agents  to   deal   in\r\n\r\ntransactions  of HDB flats.  They enjoy certain  advantages  and\r\n\r\npriorities.  Through them, the transactions can be expedited and\r\n\r\ncompleted within  4 weeks.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is only one part of the story, ie, an\r\n\r\nexamination  conducted  by the  tax  authority.   What  is  more\r\n\r\nimportant is the professionalism in the housing agents.   I hope\r\n\r\nthat  HDB  or  MND  can  help  the  housing  agents  to  form  a\r\n\r\nprofessional body or association.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my meet-the-people sessions, I have some residents\r\n\r\ncoming  to  me about the inability of  single persons above  the\r\n\r\nage of 35 who were denied  the right to buy some 3-room flats in\r\n\r\nmy  ward.    I  feel  that  we  should  consider  relaxing  this\r\n\r\nrestriction  on single persons who wish to buy HDB  flats.   For\r\n\r\nexample, in Whampoa, which is an old housing estate, there are a\r\n\r\nlot  of  senior  citizens.  Many of them are hoping  that  their\r\n\r\nchildren could come and stay with  them.  But these children who\r\n\r\nare 35 years of age and above want to be independent and they do\r\n\r\nnot want to stay in the same flat with their parents, but at the\r\n\r\nsame time, they want to be near to look after their parents.  So\r\n\r\nthe best way out is to buy a 3-room flat close to their parents'\r\n\r\nflat   so  that  they  can  also  look  after  the  old   folks.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  because of the existing  regulations,  a  single\r\n\r\nperson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  not be allowed to buy a 3-room flat in the city area  and\r\n\r\nthis  has  caused a lot of inconvenience.  In other  words  they\r\n\r\nwould  not  be staying near to their aged parents to look  after\r\n\r\nthem.  If they are working in the city, and you want them to buy\r\n\r\na  flat  in the suburban area, they will have to spend a lot  of\r\n\r\ntime    travelling  to-and-fro.    It  is  too  troublesome  and\r\n\r\ninconvenient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also come across a case where a resident wanted to\r\n\r\nsell back the 3-room flat to  HDB in order to buy a bigger flat.\r\n\r\nHowever,  HDB was rather reluctant to buy back the 3-room  flat.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, he had trouble getting the 4-room  or 5-room flat\r\n\r\nhe  wanted  for his family which had expanded.   So  if  we  can\r\n\r\nallow  single  persons aged 35 and above to buy   3-room  flats,\r\n\r\nthen it will take a load off the back of the other resident  who\r\n\r\nwanted to sell off his 3-room flat to upgrade to a bigger  flat.\r\n\r\nThis  is a win-win situation for both.  I really want to  appeal\r\n\r\nto the Minister to consider allowing singles, aged 35 and above,\r\n\r\nto buy flats in the city area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the Member raised the issue last\r\n\r\nyear.  Perhaps I can give him an update on the situation today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, there are 501 housing agencies in the scheme. We\r\n\r\nstarted with 27.  These agencies are handling almost half of all\r\n\r\nresale  transactions.   When  the  scheme  was  implemented   in\r\n\r\nDecember  1995,  its  aim was to encourage housing  agencies  to\r\n\r\nconduct resale transactions in a professional and honest manner.\r\n\r\nThe minimum criteria set for admission was that at least 50%  of\r\n\r\nthe   agency's   housing  agents  must  possess   the   relevant\r\n\r\nqualifications recognised by the IRAS.  In July 1997 the  scheme\r\n\r\nwas tightened because of feedback from MPs like Mr Choo who said\r\n\r\nthat  many agents are unqualified.  They misrepresent the buyers\r\n\r\nor  the  sellers.  They are unclear about HDB policies resulting\r\n\r\nin  misery  to  both buyers and sellers.  Thus we tightened  the\r\n\r\nscheme.   But for those agencies which had already been admitted\r\n\r\nbefore  July  1997 we give them a grace period until  June  this\r\n\r\nyear to get all their agents qualified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualification is to pass an examination set by IRAS,\r\n\r\nand we call it the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon   Examination   for  Housing  Agents.    In   fact,   the\r\n\r\nqualification  to  sit  for  this  examination  is  rather   low\r\n\r\nactually.   It  requires  3  GCE \"O\"  levels  to  sit  for  this\r\n\r\nexamination.  I have made enquiries.   The pass rate so  far  is\r\n\r\nrather dismal.  Only 20-30% of candidates passed at their  first\r\n\r\nattempt.    But  of  course  those  who  fail  can  re-sit   the\r\n\r\nexamination whenever IRAS sets the next examination.  The second\r\n\r\nattempt pass rate is much higher and more satisfactory, at 60%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has alluded to the fact that HDB flats represent\r\n\r\nthe  most  important  asset  for  almost  all  Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  only qualified agents should be allowed  to  transact\r\n\r\nHDB  flats.  I fully agree with the Member.  Unfortunately,  the\r\n\r\nAuctioneers   Act  is  not  under  the  Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.   It  is under the Ministry of Finance.   Recently,\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers also lobbied me\r\n\r\nto have some kind of regulation over real estate agents.  I have\r\n\r\npassed  the note to the Minister for Finance and I am  sure  his\r\n\r\nofficials  would be looking into it.  The Act that  governs  the\r\n\r\nactivity of housing agents is rather old actually, a rather  old\r\n\r\npiece  of  legislation,  dating  back  to  1962.   Perhaps  some\r\n\r\nmodifications  can be made, but that is up to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But HDB monitors the performance of the Licensed Housing\r\n\r\nAgents  Scheme's agents closely.  So far, after this new  scheme\r\n\r\nhas been in place, the standard of services provided by the LHAS\r\n\r\nagencies are generally better because now they have to  sit  for\r\n\r\nan  examination, they are more qualified and they know HDB rules\r\n\r\nmuch better.  Nonetheless, HDB will tighten the scheme and, with\r\n\r\nfeedback  from MPs like Mr Choo, we hope to close  many  of  the\r\n\r\nloopholes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part of his question was whether HDB will relax\r\n\r\nthe  present rule which prevents singles over 35 from buying HDB\r\n\r\nresale flat in the central area, like my area in Tiong Bahru and\r\n\r\nhis  area in Whampoa.  Under the present ruling, as the  MP  has\r\n\r\npointed out, a single is not qualified to buy.  HDB will look at\r\n\r\nthis issue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagain  to  see whether there is a need to relax.

Before I start, I would like to declare my\r\n\r\ninterest.   I am the Advisor to two related organisations.   One\r\n\r\nis  the Poultry and Livestock Farmers Association and the  other\r\n\r\nis the Poultry Importers and Exporters Association.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent outbreak of the bird flu - the technical\r\n\r\nname  is  \"Avian Influenza\" - has caused 6 lives in  Hong  Kong.\r\n\r\nThe  authority there took a very serious view of the matter  and\r\n\r\ndestroyed  about 1.5 million chickens in order to eliminate  the\r\n\r\nsource  of  the  flu  virus.  According to  reports,  there  are\r\n\r\ndifferent  versions of the reports, the flu virus is transmitted\r\n\r\nthrough  people-to-bird  contact and not  from  people-to-people\r\n\r\ncontact.   It  is therefore important to note that  so  long  as\r\n\r\nthere are birds carrying the flu virus and there is contact with\r\n\r\nthe bird by the people, either in the farm, house, pet shop,  or\r\n\r\neven  at  home  in the garden when birds frequent, people  could\r\n\r\ncatch the flu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every day we import hundreds of thousands of chicken\r\n\r\nand  ducks  for  our  Singapore slaughter  house.   Besides  the\r\n\r\nmigrant  birds  from different countries, there are  also  about\r\n\r\ntens  of  thousands  of  birds shuttling between  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  daily.  Sir, under these conditions, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask the Minister, in what way we could be free from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible  attack  of  the  bird flu.  If,  unfortunately,  there\r\n\r\nshould be an outbreak of the bird flu, what would be the plan to\r\n\r\ncontain the flu?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Hong Kong, 1.5 million birds were destroyed. It\r\n\r\ncaused  hardship  to the chicken farmers and the  traders.   The\r\n\r\nHong Kong authority compensated them financially to cushion them\r\n\r\nthrough the difficult period but their action was taken  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  interest.  Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government will consider paying compensation if part or the\r\n\r\nwhole  chicken farm or the whole import of live chicks or  birds\r\n\r\nhas  to  be destroyed in order to contain the spread of  certain\r\n\r\ndiseases   like,  for  example,  bird  flu  and  the  Salmonella\r\n\r\nenteritidis disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> As said by Prof. Low\r\n\r\njust  now,  the  recent outbreak of avian flu in Hong  Kong  was\r\n\r\ntragic, with consequences more lethal than before.  I gather for\r\n\r\nthe first time that avian flu had affected human beings.  In May\r\n\r\nlast  year, the first human was affected in Hong Kong and  since\r\n\r\nthen there were 18 confirmed cases with 6 deaths reported.  I am\r\n\r\nsure, Sir, many Singaporeans were anxious then whether the  same\r\n\r\ncould  have  happened in Singapore.  We all know of course  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's Primary Production Department is very well known for\r\n\r\nits  strict import and control system, and that must have  given\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans comfort.  But, nevertheless, certainly  there\r\n\r\nmust  have been lessons that could have been drawn from the Hong\r\n\r\nKong avian flu experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question, Sir, to the Minister, is: what did PPD do\r\n\r\nduring  the  Hong Kong crisis and what lessons were  drawn  from\r\n\r\nthat  experience?  Does PPD have any contingency  plan  to  meet\r\n\r\nsuch an eventuality, touch wood?  If yes, such a plan should  be\r\n\r\nregularly  tested.  In view of the seriousness of what  happened\r\n\r\nto  Hong  Kong,  Sir,  PPD should review  its  existing  control\r\n\r\nmeasures, and if and when necessary, tighten them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the topic I would like to\r\n\r\ntalk about is branding of eggs.  I spoke on the branding of eggs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsecutively  in the past two Budget debates.   I  am  glad  to\r\n\r\nnote  that some progress was made.  Today, all chicken eggs sold\r\n\r\nin Singapore are branded with logos representing either the farm\r\n\r\nor the importer.  For some eggs, the name \"Singapore\" is printed\r\n\r\nto indicate the eggs are produced by our local high-tech farms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the branding of eggs, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nfollowing two questions.  First, if the local farm is doing both\r\n\r\nthe  egg-laying  and  egg-importing  business,  should  the  two\r\n\r\nproducts, local eggs and imported eggs, be branded by  the  same\r\n\r\nlogo  but the word \"Singapore\" is added for the local  eggs.   I\r\n\r\nask  this question because this could cause confusion as certain\r\n\r\nlocal farms do not print the word \"Singapore\" next to their farm\r\n\r\nlogo.   Second, when we see the word \"Singapore\" printed on  the\r\n\r\negg,  does it mean that the eggs are genuinely produced  by  our\r\n\r\nlocal farms?  Does the Ministry take sufficient action to ensure\r\n\r\ntheir authenticity?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a month ago, my CCC Chairman and I went to a\r\n\r\nsupermarket to purchase two boxes of local eggs, twenty  pieces,\r\n\r\nwith the word \"Singapore\" printed on them.  I notice that in one\r\n\r\nparticular  box,  three  out of the 10 eggs  were  tainted  with\r\n\r\nchicken  droppings.   In order to prove that  there  is  nothing\r\n\r\nunusual, I went to a supermarket in Queenstown last week.  I was\r\n\r\nunable  to  confirm that dirty eggs could be  easily  found.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the name \"Singapore\" means \"quality\" and how  could\r\n\r\nwe  feel  comfortable when it is used in association with  dirty\r\n\r\neggs tainted with bird droppings.  I hope the Ministry could set\r\n\r\nout  some specifications for the farms if they want to print the\r\n\r\nword  \"Singapore\"  on  their  products.   A  penalty  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered if anyone should misuse the word \"Singapore\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the hon. Member for Chua Chu Kang is\r\n\r\na  good  friend  of mine.  He is an automotive engineer  but  he\r\n\r\nseems  to have a fascination for birds and eggs.  He is becoming\r\n\r\nan expert on birds.  I would warn him how the Chinese press will\r\n\r\ntranslate that.  But jokes aside, Sir, he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Zainul  Abidin raised a very serious  issue  about  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of Avian flu invasion into Singapore.   I  want  to\r\n\r\nreassure  him  that  he  should not, like  all  the  economists,\r\n\r\nclassify  Singapore as among the emerging countries.   Singapore\r\n\r\nis  not  Hong  Kong.   We are four to five  hours  flight  away.\r\n\r\nSingapore is Singapore, and we are very safe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. Singapore is free from bird or Avian flu\r\n\r\nand  other  bird-related diseases that can cross from  birds  to\r\n\r\nhumans.   The  risk  of  the  introduction  of  Avian  flu  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  negligible as the PPD has in place  an  effective\r\n\r\nfarm  and plant accreditation programme and tight import control\r\n\r\nsystems to prevent introduction of such diseases.  PPD has an on-going  surveillance programme to check for Avian flu in imported\r\n\r\nand domestic poultry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike Hong Kong, Singapore does not allow the slaughter of\r\n\r\npoultry at wet markets.  We did this sometime ago. But it is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  done  today.   Live  poultry in  Singapore  is  assigned\r\n\r\ndirectly  to  the  centralised slaughter  houses  for  slaughter\r\n\r\nwithin  one day.  The public does not get a chance to come  into\r\n\r\ncontact  with  live poultry and the potential for  infection  is\r\n\r\nthus drastically reduced to almost zero.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the poultry in Singapore is confined to seven\r\n\r\nfarms.   Dr Low is the advisor to some of these farmers  and  he\r\n\r\nunderstands  better  than  I  do,  that  these  farms  are  well\r\n\r\nregulated, hygienic, clean and they are well monitored  by  PPD.\r\n\r\nIt  is,  therefore,  easy  to contain any  outbreak,  like  bird\r\n\r\ndisease, compared to other countries like Hong Kong.  But Dr Low\r\n\r\nand  Mr Zainul Abidin have raised very valid issues.  Is  it  at\r\n\r\nall possible for Avian flu virus to invade Singapore?  There are\r\n\r\nno  guarantees.  But given the surveillance programme we have in\r\n\r\nplace,  it is unlikely that any Singaporean will be contaminated\r\n\r\nwith Avian flu in Singapore from imported poultry.  They may get\r\n\r\nit on holiday in Hong Kong, I do not know.  Nonetheless, we will\r\n\r\ntake note of the lessons learned in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin asked what we were doing when the outbreak\r\n\r\nwas   at   its   peak  in  Hong  Kong.   Singapore  sent   three\r\n\r\nrepresentatives to Hong Kong to study the situation  there  with\r\n\r\nthe  hope  of  learning  important  lessons  and  preventing  an\r\n\r\noutbreak at the same time in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, PPD is looking at the surveillance system\r\n\r\nand  coming  out  with an exercise plan that  just  in  case  an\r\n\r\nunknown  virus were to come to Singapore, we will know  what  to\r\n\r\ndo.   Because  it is a multi-agency task, we need to  coordinate\r\n\r\nwith  Environment  Ministry;  we need  to  coordinate  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health; we need to coordinate with the  media.   So\r\n\r\nthe programme is in place.  And I want to assure the two Members\r\n\r\nand  all  Singaporeans that if the virus  does  come,  which  is\r\n\r\nunlikely, we are ready.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the egg problem, this is Dr Low's cut in three\r\n\r\nsuccessive years.  Imitation is the best form of flattery.  So I\r\n\r\nthink  our chicken farmers must have done something good because\r\n\r\nforeign  egg  farmers are now, according to Dr Low, putting  the\r\n\r\nSingapore logo onto their eggs.  But this is not prevalent.  Let\r\n\r\nme explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January 1997, PPD requires both imported and local\r\n\r\neggs  to  be labelled.  So if it is a foreign egg, you label  it\r\n\r\naccordingly.  If it is a local egg, or you import it, you  label\r\n\r\nit  accordingly.   This is to enable PPD to take  the  necessary\r\n\r\naction.   If  eggs  from  any particular consignment  are  found\r\n\r\ncontaminated with harmful pathogens or residues, we can stop the\r\n\r\neggs if we discover something irregular.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eggs sold in Singapore are inspected and monitored by PPD\r\n\r\nvery  regularly. We consume something like 3 million eggs a day.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  an  important health matter for PPD.  Imported  eggs\r\n\r\nespecially are checked to ensure that the consignments  of  eggs\r\n\r\nare  clean and labelled with a unique farm code and logo of  the\r\n\r\nexporting farm.  If a consignment of imported eggs is  found  to\r\n\r\nhave  mislabelled  eggs,  or  if more  than  5%  of  eggs  in  a\r\n\r\nconsignment  are  unlabelled, then PPD will take  action.   This\r\n\r\nranges from a warning to a total ban.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPD has on its own also received feedback that some\r\n\r\nimported  eggs have the word \"Singapore\" branded on  them.   PPD\r\n\r\nwill intensify these checks and take corrective action.  But  to\r\n\r\nhelp consumers differentiate local eggs from imported eggs,  the\r\n\r\nPPD,  with  the  help of local farmers, will  be  introducing  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  Quality  Egg Scheme by June 1998.   The  scheme  will\r\n\r\nallow  local  farms  which meet prescribed standards  to  use  a\r\n\r\nquality  mark on their eggs.  But at the same time, I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMember  to  also  inform his egg farmers that  the  egg  farmers\r\n\r\nthemselves  must be proactive.  They must market their  eggs  to\r\n\r\nlocal consumers.  So local consumers are aware that this egg  is\r\n\r\nimported, not so good maybe; this egg is locally produced, maybe\r\n\r\nvery good.  So I think the marketing aspect must be done by  the\r\n\r\nlocal  farmers.  And only then will loyalty to local  brands  be\r\n\r\nestablished in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I thank the Members, Dr Low and Mr Zainul Abidin, for\r\n\r\nraising this important issue and I hope the House is reassured.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I have a clarification? I\r\n\r\nwonder  if  the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that  some  egg\r\n\r\nproducers claim that their eggs contain low cholesterol.  Let me\r\n\r\ntell  you  my experience.  I bought one of these boxes of  eggs,\r\n\r\nclaiming  to have low cholesterol.  And when the egg  was  half-boiled,  cracked open, I noticed that the yolk of  the  egg  was\r\n\r\nvery large compared to other eggs.  To my understanding, all the\r\n\r\ncholesterol is, in fact, contained in the yolk of the  egg,  and\r\n\r\nnot  the white of the egg.  So if this egg has got a larger than\r\n\r\nnormal  size yolk, how can the producers claim that it  has  got\r\n\r\nlow cholesterol?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I have heard similar tales that some\r\n\r\nof  the locally produced eggs contain low cholesterol.  I am not\r\n\r\na  veterinarian, I am an agronomist.  But I tend to believe that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  possibility, a real likelihood, that  our  locally\r\n\r\nproduced  eggs  contain low cholesterol because the  cholesterol\r\n\r\ncontent in the chicken and the egg depends on the chicken  feed.\r\n\r\nAnd I am told that Singapore farmers, through advice given by Dr\r\n\r\nLow, use good chicken feed.  It is just like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhumans.   If  you  take  a  lot of  pork  fat,  teka,  you  have\r\n\r\ncholesterol.  But if you take vegetables, fresh fruits, you  may\r\n\r\nhave  lower cholesterol.  So I am assured that our local chicken\r\n\r\nfarmers  use good chicken feed.  So do not complain that chicken\r\n\r\negg is slightly more expensive in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I think the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  missed  the  point.   The  point  is  that  all   the\r\n\r\ncholesterol is contained only in the egg yolk.  So  if  the  egg\r\n\r\nyolk  is  larger than normal, it would definitely  contain  more\r\n\r\ncholesterol than an egg which has got a smaller yolk, unless you\r\n\r\nare  saying  that the concentration of the cholesterol  is  very\r\n\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> It is not true, because he is saying that\r\n\r\nbigger  yolk must correlate with higher cholesterol.   A  skinny\r\n\r\nperson  can  have  high cholesterol.  A fat  man  may  have  low\r\n\r\ncholesterol.  So what appears to be may not be.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we have to get away from this\r\n\r\nchicken  and  egg  question.

Because every now and then certain  lots\r\n\r\nof  the chickens in the farm have to be destroyed due to certain\r\n\r\nreasons.   So  in the case like Hong Kong, 1.5 million  chickens\r\n\r\nwere  actually destroyed, which was quite a significant  number.\r\n\r\nWe  do  not  have  such a big farm.

In 1997, for the first time,  about  200\r\n\r\nshops were sold with 30-year lease.  The response was  very good\r\n\r\nand  the  take-up  rate  is as high as  97%.   In  Bukit  Gombak\r\n\r\nConstituency, I believe we have 100% take-up rate.  Shop tenants\r\n\r\nwho  bought these shops are now paying monthly instalments which\r\n\r\nare actually lower than the rental they were paying prior to the\r\n\r\npurchase.

How many of them have applied to convert the 99-year lease to 30-year lease?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, according to my understanding, the closing date\r\n\r\nfor  such applications is at the end of this month.  I hope that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister will consider extending the closing date  or  even\r\n\r\ncompletely  abolish  the  closing date,  so  as  to  give  these\r\n\r\nshopowners more time to consider whether or not to apply for the\r\n\r\nconversion.  At this time of economic uncertainty, we should  be\r\n\r\nmore  sympathetic to these small-time businessmen by giving them\r\n\r\nmore breathing space to pull through these difficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is, since the 30-year lease has the\r\n\r\nsupport  of the shopowners, will the Government consider selling\r\n\r\nmore of the remaining shops, and how many such shops can be sold\r\n\r\nper year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also hope that the Minister will consider selling\r\n\r\nsome   of   these  30-year  lease  shophouses  to  the  existing\r\n\r\nshopowners in Bukit Gombak, in the next round of sales of shops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I was pleasantly surprised to\r\n\r\nlearn  from  the Minister just now that two thirds  of  the  HDB\r\n\r\nshops have already been sold.  I wonder whether he has forgotten\r\n\r\nsome of his older customers and lessees in some of the older HDB\r\n\r\nshops  in  areas like Queenstown.  In particular, I am referring\r\n\r\nto  the  Tanglin Halt precinct area where shops which  are  more\r\n\r\nthan 30 years are still not sold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the lessees of these shops are very keen to have\r\n\r\ntheir  shops purchased, at least on a 30-year scheme  or  lease.\r\n\r\nThey hope that with that they could rejuvenate the area and  the\r\n\r\nshops.  I was told that perhaps one of the reasons is that  they\r\n\r\nare two-level shops.  So the cost of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nland  may  be  higher.  But there have been cases  of  two-level\r\n\r\nshops which have been sold by HDB.  Even in that precinct,  many\r\n\r\nof  the  shops  are  actually on the ground level  of  high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings.  I hope the Ministry can consider this and give these\r\n\r\nold and loyal customers of HDB a chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, first, I would like to give Members\r\n\r\nof  this  House an update of the 30-year lease shop sale scheme.\r\n\r\nThe HDB has received 95 written enquiries on the conversion from\r\n\r\n99-year lease to 30-year lease.  Out of these, 52 shopowners are\r\n\r\nactively  pursuing their applications.  HDB is processing  these\r\n\r\napplications  and will inform them of the buy-back  process  for\r\n\r\nthe existing leases and the selling prices of the 30-year leases\r\n\r\nsoon.    These shopowners would then have to decide  whether  to\r\n\r\nproceed with the conversion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked whether the Ministry will consider\r\n\r\ngiving  99-year lease shopowners more time to convert their  99-year  lease to 30-year lease.  We have given a four-month window\r\n\r\nfor  existing  99-year lease shopkeepers to convert  to  30-year\r\n\r\nlease.   The announcement was made on 1st December 1997 and  the\r\n\r\nclosing  date  is 31st March 1998.  Anybody will  consider  this\r\n\r\nreasonable.  Nonetheless, since the Member has made  an  appeal,\r\n\r\nwe  can  consider extending it.  But it is not the intention  of\r\n\r\nHDB  to keep this window wide open permanently.  In view of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent economic slowdown, an introduction of the 30-year  lease\r\n\r\nand also the picture as to whether the conversion of 99-year  or\r\n\r\n30-year lease is very welcomed or otherwise, HDB will reduce the\r\n\r\nsale of shops programme to two sales a year, that is, about  200\r\n\r\nshops  in  each sale.  HDB will review this number  periodically\r\n\r\nand respond to the sale of shops accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has made a passionate plea to HDB to sell some\r\n\r\nof the shops in his area to the shop tenants.  I will ask HDB to\r\n\r\nkeep in mind his appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay has asked whether HDB has forgotten some of the\r\n\r\nolder estates like Queenstown.  The answer is no.  Because he is\r\n\r\nin Tanjong Pagar GRC, I will never\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforget  him.  But HDB sells shops according to various criteria,\r\n\r\nie,  geographical spread, age, need and potential land use.   So\r\n\r\nthe  sale  of shops programme has not arrived in the  Queenstown\r\n\r\nward.  But I will ask HDB to look at his request again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> I would like to thank the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary.

Sir, I have  spoken  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject many times in this House and I shall continue to do  so.\r\n\r\nThe  reason is that under the present system of disbursing  CIPC\r\n\r\nfunds,  which  are  public  money,  the  Opposition  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  shall never be able to get any CIPC  funds  to  help\r\n\r\nthem carry out the community projects in their constituencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, if my town council wants to embark on a\r\n\r\ncommunity  project, I have to apply for CIPC funds  through  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the CCC, who is presently Mr Andy Gan.  Mr Andy Gan,\r\n\r\nas  you  know, was the PAP parliamentary candidate who contested\r\n\r\nagainst  me  in  the  last  two  general  elections,  but  lost.\r\n\r\nRecently, it was announced that Mr Gan shall stand against me in\r\n\r\nthe next GE.  That being the case, I do not expect that he would\r\n\r\nadvise his Chairman of the CCC to approve applications for  CIPC\r\n\r\nfunds  from  me, who is his rival.  If the system of  disbursing\r\n\r\nCIPC  funds is not changed, I shall never be able to get any  of\r\n\r\nsuch  funds  to  carry out any of my community  projects  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am asking that the present system of allocation of\r\n\r\nCIPC  funds in relation to the Opposition wards be changed.   As\r\n\r\nan Opposition Member, I do not have any grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nthere.  So applications cannot be made through the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations which are not present.  I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat  at  the  Opposition  wards, the MP  should  be  given  the\r\n\r\nauthority to recommend applications for CIPC funds and  not  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of the CCC.  Unless we have this change of  disbursing\r\n\r\nCIPC   funds,  an  Opposition  Member  cannot  carry   out   any\r\n\r\nimprovements  in  his  constituency  to  the  extent  that  PAP-controlled constituencies can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the disbursement of CIPC funds, to-date, I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  each  of the PAP MPs has benefited  by  about  $1\r\n\r\nmillion  worth  of CIPC funds.  But no Opposition  MP  has  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in his application for CIPC funds.  This  House  has\r\n\r\nrecently been told that a sum of $36 million shall be set  aside\r\n\r\nfor  CIPC funds.  If we divide this amount equally among the  83\r\n\r\nMPs,  each would be allocated about $430,000.   My question  is:\r\n\r\nwill  each  of the Opposition MPs be allocated this  amount  for\r\n\r\ntheir community projects this year?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, it has been a long day. It is\r\n\r\nalways interesting to listen to Mr Chiam.  He asked whether  all\r\n\r\nelected  Members are entitled to a share of the CIPC funds.   My\r\n\r\nanswer  is all CCCs, all Singaporeans are entitled to  the  CIPC\r\n\r\nfunds,  which  is  more important.  All CCCs,  including  Potong\r\n\r\nPasir  CCC, have benefited from the disbursement of CIPC  funds.\r\n\r\nIt  is  important to work through the channels of CCC.  Mr Chiam\r\n\r\nis   very   welcome  to  work  with  some  of   the   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations   like,  for  example,  the   Sennett   Residents'\r\n\r\nAssociation which is, I am sure, apolitical and, being a private\r\n\r\nestate  Residents' Association, it is likely to  be  politically\r\n\r\nsympathetic to Mr Chiam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not true that all PAP MPs have an easy time getting\r\n\r\nCIPC  funds.  I have on many occasions turned down requests from\r\n\r\nmany  of my colleagues.  Each project is evaluated based on  its\r\n\r\ncost benefit analysis.  If it benefits your residents and if the\r\n\r\ncost  benefit  ratio works out, then it does not matter  whether\r\n\r\nyou are a PAP MP or an Opposition MP.  In fact, his Potong Pasir\r\n\r\nward has benefited from the CIPC programme.  So has Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKhiang's  ward  which  has benefited enormously  from  the  CIPC\r\n\r\nprogramme.

As I understand Mr Andy Gan\r\n\r\nonly managed to get $7,500 ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> $7,750.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Anyway, it is not even $10,000, and not\r\n\r\n1%  of  what a PAP MP's CCC would have been awarded on  average.\r\n\r\nSo he cannot say that it is tremendous.  In any event, the point\r\n\r\nis  that we are also doing community projects, like constructing\r\n\r\npebble walk, landscaping, walkways and covered walkways.   These\r\n\r\nare  projects in which CIPC funds have been freely disbursed  to\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  constituencies.  Why are we not allowed  to  get  such\r\n\r\nsimilar  funds?  We have to spend our own funds of  $300,000  to\r\n\r\nerect  five linkways.  We have asked for it, but we did not  get\r\n\r\nit.  Why?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> First of all, Mr Chiam, being a longer\r\n\r\nMember  in  this House, knows better than I do that CIPC  is  an\r\n\r\nextension of the Urban Rural Services Committee which was set up\r\n\r\nin   the  early  1960s  to  do  gotong  royong  projects.    The\r\n\r\narrangement then was that the CCCs would work together with  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations and put up submissions to the  Ministry\r\n\r\nto  get funding.  Since the formation of town councils, we  have\r\n\r\nstuck  to  this arrangement because his jurisdiction as  a  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil Chairman only extends to the HDB estates' common  areas.\r\n\r\nIt  does not extend to areas like Sennett Estate, where the  CCC\r\n\r\ncan  rarely reach out to the non-HDB estates' common areas which\r\n\r\nare outside his jurisdiction.  That is the reason why the CCC is\r\n\r\nstill  the best vehicle for applying for CIPC funds.  If I  were\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam,  I  will  work with the Sennett RA  and  the  various\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations.  The important thing is  to  get  the\r\n\r\ndisbursement through.  If he jumps on the right vehicle, then he\r\n\r\nmay get the CIPC fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I get one more clarification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I want the system changed.\r\n\r\nBecause  as  long as the present system is in existence,  as  an\r\n\r\nelected  MP, I have to apply to an Advisor, who is the  defeated\r\n\r\ncandidate,  for funds.  How is he going to advise his  Chairman?\r\n\r\nWill he say, \"Okay, by all means give it to Mr Chiam.\"  He would\r\n\r\nnever  do that.  That is against his interest.  He wants  to  be\r\n\r\nknown  that he is doing the project.  And if he cannot do it,  I\r\n\r\nalso  cannot  get it.  So it is a dog in the manger  policy.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  PAP  will  not accept such a  policy.   We  want  the\r\n\r\nconstituency improved and the only way we can really improve  it\r\n\r\nto  the  standard of the PAP's is we must have the  CIPC  funds.\r\n\r\nLet us play on a level field.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I have suggested how he can get the\r\n\r\nCIPC   funds   and,  that  is,  to  work  with  the   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations.  Some time last month, he asked me in this  House\r\n\r\nwhether I have received the submissions for walkways proposed by\r\n\r\nhis  town  council.  I have not received that.  I  was  thinking\r\n\r\nthat  even  if he follows the proper channel, goes  through  the\r\n\r\nCCC,  CCC approves and it comes to me, I am not sure whether  he\r\n\r\nhas  the money to do the walkways. Because I said in this  House\r\n\r\nlast  year that most CIPC-funded projects come with a co-payment\r\n\r\nportion.   The CCC may use the town council as the  agent.   For\r\n\r\nsome  projects like walkways, the co-funding is 10% by the  town\r\n\r\ncouncil.  So CIPC  pays 90%.  Walkways are very expensive.   The\r\n\r\nper foot run unit cost is something like $1,000-$2,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been looking at his balance sheet and income\r\n\r\nstatement,  and he has been running operating deficits  for  two\r\n\r\nyears.  For 1995-1996, the operating deficit was $150,000.   For\r\n\r\n1996-1997, the operating deficit was $195,000.  I wonder how the\r\n\r\nMember  can  run  a  town council.  His accumulated  deficit  is\r\n\r\n$114,000.   I told him last year and I will tell him again  that\r\n\r\nhe  should  not  be asking for projects.  He should  be  cutting\r\n\r\nprojects.   He  should be finding ways to make his town  council\r\n\r\nviable, because he is two years in the red.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I am very sorry that the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbring  this  up, because it is not in our topic of debate.   The\r\n\r\ndebate  now is about disbursing of CIPC funds.  And out  of  the\r\n\r\nblue,  he  wants  to  delve  into Potong  Pasir  Town  Council's\r\n\r\naccounts.  But I am telling  him now that we have never run into\r\n\r\na  deficit  except for one year.  Last year, due to a  technical\r\n\r\nproblem, as an MP, I had to change parties.   Apparently, we had\r\n\r\nto take away all the monies that I had in credit balance and put\r\n\r\nit  into  some  other funds.  And because of  this  movement  of\r\n\r\nfunds,  it would appear that we had a deficit. But, in fact,  we\r\n\r\nhave,  on record now a credit balance of over $300,000.   So  we\r\n\r\nhad  got no deficits for two years.  This is not true.  I  think\r\n\r\nhe had better withdraw that statement or verify his facts before\r\n\r\nhe says that Potong Pasir Town Council has two years of deficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that the system must be changed. If the\r\n\r\nsystem  is  not  changed, I will never get any  CIPC  funds  for\r\n\r\nimprovements or projects at Potong Pasir.  That is the  crux  of\r\n\r\nthe  matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary has asked me to go  to\r\n\r\nSennett   Estate and ask the residents' association  to  do  it.\r\n\r\nBut  Sennett Estate is a private estate. It is not a HDB estate.\r\n\r\nWe  are talking about HDB estates.  The private estates can take\r\n\r\ncare  of  themselves.  The two HDB estates in Potong  Pasir  are\r\n\r\nmuch  larger  than  Sennett Estate.  We should  start  with  the\r\n\r\nhousing estates in Potong Pasir first before we go on to Sennett\r\n\r\nEstate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point is whether I can get a commitment from the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development that the rules of applying  for\r\n\r\nCIPC funds will be changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, the operating deficits were published\r\n\r\nin  the  auditor's statements.

One era of some interest and importance  is\r\n\r\nthat  of  the  pre-Parameswara and prior to the opening  of  the\r\n\r\nisland by the British.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I thank the Member for moving to\r\n\r\nthese two very green pastures.  How do we inject life, soul  and\r\n\r\nspirit into the Singapore Botanic Gardens (SBG) and Fort Canning\r\n\r\nPark?  These are the issues which are focusing the minds of  the\r\n\r\nNational Parks officials.  They will take up some of his  ideas.\r\n\r\nOver the years, they have been doing quite a lot.  The fact that\r\n\r\nthese  two  places  are tropical parks makes  it  a  little  bit\r\n\r\ndifficult  compared to, say, temperate parks like Hyde  Park  or\r\n\r\nCentral Park,  because the weather is against them.  If we mount\r\n\r\na  cultural show or a Shakespearean play in the afternoon,  very\r\n\r\nfew  people  will go there.  So we are limited  to  narrow  time\r\n\r\nwindows,  in  the  evenings and public  holidays.  The  Member's\r\n\r\npoints  are taken and we will see how to make these things  come\r\n\r\nalive at Fort Canning, and how to make SBG more exciting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for some of the items that we have done, eg, we have\r\n\r\nopened up SBG up to midnight.  I think we can do a lot from  the\r\n\r\nevening  to midnight.  Since 1995, performances have  also  been\r\n\r\nstaged at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSymphony  Stage, located at Symphony Lake.  These, I understand,\r\n\r\nhave been attracting very appreciative and sizable audiences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Horticulture in the Singapore Botanic Gardens\r\n\r\nhas  been  conducting gardening courses and guided  tours.   All\r\n\r\nthese help to inject some life and culture into SBG.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fort Canning Park is a different kettle of fish. It is on\r\n\r\na  hill.  It has a lot of historical potential and we will  work\r\n\r\nwith  Mr  Zainul Abidin to see how we can make it more exciting.\r\n\r\nOf  course, now the Battle Box is there, not well used  and  not\r\n\r\nwell  known but it is there.  Maybe we should encourage  schools\r\n\r\nto conduct more visits.  Dr Ong Chit Chung is not here.  Maybe I\r\n\r\nwill ask him to facilitate, as he is involved in the Battle Box.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, with that refreshing\r\n\r\nresponse, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think this has been quite a day of fishes,\r\n\r\nchickens, birds and eggs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $460,151,560 for Head U ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $17,219,293,400 for Head U ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head J -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head J - Ministry of Community Development.\r\n\r\nDr Vasoo, amendment No. (1).\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S.

I  think this is very important, because  we  can\r\n\r\nreduce  the  social divide amongst people.  We need  to  enhance\r\n\r\ncommunity building.  Otherwise, there will be abrasions  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity amongst different groups and,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore,  it is essentially necessary that we pay  very  close\r\n\r\nattention to the area of community building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the social health of Singapore society varies directly\r\n\r\nwith  the  degree of Singaporeans' civility.  The more civil  we\r\n\r\nare,  the  more  caring we are, the more cohesive the  community\r\n\r\nwill be.  My parliamentary colleagues and I join the Minister to\r\n\r\nurge  the  Ministry of Finance to deploy more resources  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Community Development, so that they will be able  to\r\n\r\nundertake   more  programmes  for  building  a   more   cohesive\r\n\r\ncommunity.   I think this is important because there  should  be\r\n\r\nmore  resources  to  be allocated in the area of  prevention  of\r\n\r\nsocial problems and in helping to build better communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of the preventive programmes, we should pay\r\n\r\nclose  attention to this.  There is a need to invest in  people.\r\n\r\nI  feel  there is a need for more resources.  We are not  asking\r\n\r\nfor  handouts  but  it  is important to  invest  in  the  social\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.   And  this is crucial  because  it  is  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of building a better community, a better social  health\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the assistance for the retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers.  In anticipation that more older and unskilled  workers\r\n\r\nare likely to be affected by retrenchment, it is helpful for the\r\n\r\nMinistry to put in place additional measures and plans to assist\r\n\r\nthem.   Some  of  these  retrenched older workers,  particularly\r\n\r\nthose  with less skills, may be less employable.  And I  foresee\r\n\r\nthat  there will be this group of people who require help.  They\r\n\r\nmay  face  hardship.  I would like to find out  what  additional\r\n\r\ncontingency  measures that the Ministry will be taking  to  help\r\n\r\nolder retrenched workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I first of\r\n\r\nall  declare my interest.

If  we  want to build a caring society, a society  that\r\n\r\nlooks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter  one another and is concerned about the well-being of  the\r\n\r\nsociety,  then  we must get our priority right.  In  Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontext,  I  think  a call has been made by my colleague,  Madam\r\n\r\nChiang,  about  the allocation of funds.  I  am  not  trying  to\r\n\r\nbegrudge  the  Ministry of Home Affairs for its  funds.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink  MCD  should be given sufficient funds so  that  it  could\r\n\r\ncarry out its responsibility and duty to the society at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have stated in the budget debate that the emphasis\r\n\r\nshould be on retraining of the workers, but there may be a small\r\n\r\ngroup of workers who may find it difficult to either retrain  or\r\n\r\neven  obtain  a  job in the market, Sir.  They  may  be  out  of\r\n\r\nemployment for some long months and I think we should give  them\r\n\r\nsome  financial assistance.  The usual assistance that they will\r\n\r\nget will be not sufficient.  In doing so, I would like to assure\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  that I am not suggesting that  we  should  go  on\r\n\r\nencouraging handouts, welfarism, but I think it would be  unjust\r\n\r\nnot to help our fellow Singaporeans, who because of the economic\r\n\r\nconditions,  do not have the financial means to look  after  the\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular context, Sir, I am really concerned\r\n\r\nabout  the  children,  their education and welfare,  should  not\r\n\r\nsuffer.  I would ask the Minister to urge his colleague, if need\r\n\r\nbe,  to set up a special fund for this purpose and perhaps at  a\r\n\r\nlater  date  he could persuade his colleague, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.   It is of course not helping the economy directly  but\r\n\r\nyou  are helping your fellow Singaporeans who may later on  help\r\n\r\nthe  economic life of Singapore.  I would urge the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> On the area of care for the aged and dependants,\r\n\r\nSir, this area should receive serious attention although we have\r\n\r\nbeen  discussing about this area for a long time.  It  has  been\r\n\r\nattended  to  by  a number of ministries, ie,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development, the Ministry of Health and the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour  which deals with retired workers.  So  there  are  a\r\n\r\nnumber of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nministries involved in this whole issue.  There is a need for  a\r\n\r\nmore  coordinated effort to examine this whole area of care  for\r\n\r\nthe  aged in a more comprehensive manner.  Although there  is  a\r\n\r\nCommittee  which is studying into this whole issue, there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed  for  one  ministry to orchestrate, manage and  direct  the\r\n\r\nwhole  plans  for  the  care of the  aged.   And  this  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  because you require a single agency to set directions\r\n\r\nto  deal with a problem, the greying problem of Singapore, in  a\r\n\r\nmore comprehensive manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the next 10 years, at least 15% of our population\r\n\r\nwould have aged.  Population ageing will pose an acute challenge\r\n\r\nto  our  society.   I  note that in my meet-the-people  sessions\r\n\r\nthere are increasing numbers of families who are requesting  for\r\n\r\nhelp  for the dependent aged and particularly the aged  who  are\r\n\r\nsick  and disabled.  Many members of these families are working.\r\n\r\nThey  work in different sectors.  It makes it difficult for them\r\n\r\nto  render  assistance, ie, the care and support to  their  aged\r\n\r\nparents  who  require special care.  With all the  goodwill  and\r\n\r\nintention,  Sir, many of these families run into serious  stress\r\n\r\nand problems.  It is important that we examine these issues very\r\n\r\nclosely  and see how this whole problem of the care of dependent\r\n\r\naged  can  receive the kind of service delivery which  would  be\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more people are also expected to retire. There is a\r\n\r\nlarge  talent  pool  out there and many of them  can  contribute\r\n\r\nfurther  to  our  society.  There is a case  to  see  how  their\r\n\r\ntalents  and  expertise could be tapped and redeployed  and  how\r\n\r\nthey could be helped to be re-engaged in our society to continue\r\n\r\nto be useful members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in time to come, we will also witness that there will\r\n\r\nbe  less carers available because of a declining population.  On\r\n\r\naverage, the family-size will be less than 2 children.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthese  children will be left with the problems of the burden  of\r\n\r\ncare  and we have to see how these dependent family members  can\r\n\r\nbe  supported through a strengthened support network within  the\r\n\r\ncommunity itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of this acute greying scenario, the\r\n\r\nMinistry   should  take  a  lead  role  to  implement   a   more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  plan to meet the challenges posed by  our  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation.  Sir, what comprehensive and coordinated  plans  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to be put in place to deal with the ageing problems  more\r\n\r\neffectively?   This is an important issue that we have  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  because  there  are more and more families  that  will  be\r\n\r\naffected  by this problem out there.  We still require  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  family members to contribute to the economy.  We need  to\r\n\r\nfind ways to lessen their burden and there is an urgency to find\r\n\r\na  better coordinated effort to deal with this greying issue  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, most people,\r\n\r\nincluding women, need to work for a living.  The care  of  their\r\n\r\ndependants and the needs arising from their having to work  then\r\n\r\nbecome  important.  My concern, Sir, is about how much more  can\r\n\r\nwe further enhance our facilities to benefit our elderly and our\r\n\r\nschool-going  children.   Although  the  Ministry  of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment has done very well up till now in these  two  areas,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need  for  an  even more radical  and  accelerated\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the rapidly increasing population of the elderly\r\n\r\nand  the increasing recognition of benefits from supervised care\r\n\r\nof  children before and after the school hours, MCD may  perhaps\r\n\r\nbe  even  more  proactive  and supportive  towards  having  more\r\n\r\nCentres  of  Activities for the Retired and Elderly  (CARE)  and\r\n\r\nBefore-and-After  School Care (BASC) Centres.   Sir,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsuggesting  building more expensive structures.  I am suggesting\r\n\r\nincreased usage of community centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our community centres are strategically located all\r\n\r\nover  Singapore  and they are all within walking distances  from\r\n\r\nthe housing estates.  This user-friendly element is only one  of\r\n\r\nthe  plus  points.   The other and perhaps even  more  important\r\n\r\nadvantages  include  very low capital outlay  and  very  reduced\r\n\r\nrunning  costs.  This is possible, when in fact,  these  centres\r\n\r\nare  supported by grassroots organisations like CCMCs, CCCs  and\r\n\r\neven RCs.  Self-help within the community is a desirable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature and better rapport among the residents will be promoted.\r\n\r\nPutting  to better use our community centres which are sparingly\r\n\r\nused   in   the  day  time  is  also  a  worthwhile  point   for\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is so in the case of CARE, especially when various\r\n\r\nfacilities like activity halls, dining halls, karaoke and  games\r\n\r\nrooms  are  already present in community centres.  As  for  BASC\r\n\r\ncentres,  there  are  already  several  of  them  operating   in\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres.  One of them is in my Kim Seng  Constituency\r\n\r\nat the Bukit Ho Swee Community Centre.  It is rather popular and\r\n\r\nis  being  run  effectively  and efficiently  within  the  usual\r\n\r\ncommunity  centre  setting.  So much so that I  feel  we  should\r\n\r\naccelerate  introducing  the  concept  of  BASC  programmes   at\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres.   I notice that one of these  centres  needs\r\n\r\nonly  30  students  to become self-sufficient.   We  do  need  a\r\n\r\nfurther 60 or so BASC centres in the next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that the support for BASC centres from the\r\n\r\nMinistry for Community Development has been most commendable.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to see the same sense of commitment and urgency given\r\n\r\ntowards  the  CARE concept.  I am sure the People's  Association\r\n\r\nwill  be  happy that the various community centres and clubs  be\r\n\r\nused in this value-added manner and welcome such arrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, ageing is not just a\r\n\r\nproblem  of  the poor who are being well taken care  of  by  the\r\n\r\nservice  of  MCD.  Ageing and how to cope with the  problems  of\r\n\r\nageing and how to care for them is a major issue.  The best care\r\n\r\nfor  the  aged is to help them to continue working and  to  help\r\n\r\nthem  to  care  for themselves.  Many senior citizens,  who  are\r\n\r\nstill  healthy,  want to carry on working.  Employment  services\r\n\r\nfor  senior citizens are taken care of by the MOL, PA, MCD, SAGE\r\n\r\nand  others.  The demand for retirees seeking full-time or part-time  employment  will  increase.   But  currently,  there   are\r\n\r\nproblems such as employer's attitude towards employing retirees,\r\n\r\nthe elderly's salary expectation and other demands which are not\r\n\r\nrealistic.  Sir, there should be job counselling for  older  job\r\n\r\nregistrants\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut I understand this is lacking.  Providing a second career for\r\n\r\nretirees would be a major challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, different Government ministries handle different\r\n\r\nservices  for  the  aged.   MCD looks after  the  aged  and  the\r\n\r\ndestitute, while MOH looks after health and home nursing  needs.\r\n\r\nVolunteer welfare organisations look after senior citizens, day-care centres, befriender networks and meal deliveries. Of course\r\n\r\nHDB looks after the housing needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elderly are a very diverse group of people with\r\n\r\ndifferent needs.  There is therefore a need to provide  a  total\r\n\r\napproach  in  the care of the elderly so that the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  groups of elderly can be addressed.  Many of  the  aged\r\n\r\nfind  it  very confusing to have to go to different agencies  to\r\n\r\napply for various forms of assistance.  Care for the aged can be\r\n\r\nbetter  coordinated and improved so as to avoid  duplication  of\r\n\r\nresources.  MCD with its wide experience in looking after senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  could be the lead agency to handle all issues relating\r\n\r\nto the elderly.  There should be a one-stop service point set up\r\n\r\nin  MCD and all the CDC service centres to explain policies  and\r\n\r\nprovide  services to senior citizens.  This can be  easily  done\r\n\r\nthrough IT and the different Government computerised networks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our Asian culture, the family is expected to look\r\n\r\nafter the elderly.  In encouraging families to take care of  the\r\n\r\nelderly,  the  Government  and the  community  have  to  provide\r\n\r\noptions to help such families cope with the elderly and  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  maintain  and strengthen family  links  between  the\r\n\r\ngenerations.   With advance in modern medicine and longer  life-span  we  now  have the old in their 60s looking after  the  yet\r\n\r\nolder parents in their 80s, and many of these people in the  60s\r\n\r\nthemselves need care.  Families who have to cope with  work  and\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time  take  care of  frail  elderly  parents  can\r\n\r\ncertainly need information, guidance and training on care giving\r\n\r\nas well as different support services to help them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what services are\r\n\r\navailable   now  to  address  these  needs.   Are  these   needs\r\n\r\nsufficient?   And  what plans are there to meet  the  increasing\r\n\r\ndemand for such services as our population ages.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I share the sentiments of Dr Ho\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the problems faced by the aged, but I would like\r\n\r\nfirst to deal with the young dependants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Lily Neo has pointed out the after-care centres. I\r\n\r\nthink it is important that we look after our young students  and\r\n\r\nI  am  glad  that  the community centres -  and  I  applaud  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres - are doing a good job.  I visited  the  CDAC\r\n\r\nself-help  group in which Mr Chan  Soo Sen was then  running  at\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh  and I was very impressed by the way it was  managed.\r\n\r\nWhat I would urge is that the other community clan associations,\r\n\r\nwhich  have  their own premises, which are not used in  the  day\r\n\r\ntime,  could  consider turning them into after-care centres  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  the Minister may consider giving them some grants.   It\r\n\r\nis  not  really expensive to run such centres.   I think we  can\r\n\r\nsolve this problem, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the community centres are doing a wonderful job but I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think we are going to be fair to them to allow them  to\r\n\r\nshoulder  the  responsibility.  I think the community  at  large\r\n\r\nmust also do something about this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move to the problems of the aged. The\r\n\r\nGovernment has acknowledged that we are going to have an  ageing\r\n\r\nproblem in years to come.  Unless we tackle the problem now,  we\r\n\r\nwould have to face greater problems in years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President, in the Opening of the 9th Parliament,\r\n\r\nhas highlighted the issue and in the Addendum to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nCommunity Development this was what was said.  May I quote  with\r\n\r\nyour permission, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We will encourage Singaporeans to prepare early for\r\n\r\nretirement, and to remain socially and physically active as they\r\n\r\nbecome  senior  citizens.   We will promote  positive  attitudes\r\n\r\ntowards ageing and filial responsibilities.  Respect for  elders\r\n\r\nshould be an integral value in our gracious society.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge the Minister to look afresh at a report\r\n\r\nwhich  was actually discussed in this House some years back.   I\r\n\r\nam  referring to the Howe Yoon Chong Report.  By courtesy of the\r\n\r\nLibrarian,  I was given a copy and I studied it.  I  would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry officials and the Minister to have a look  at  it.\r\n\r\nMany  of the observations and recommendations it had made should\r\n\r\nbe  relooked.  Unfortunately, because of CPF, we threw the  baby\r\n\r\nwith the bath water.  We should not make the error again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should encourage our citizens to prepare for\r\n\r\nretirement.   I  totally agree.  They should be  prepared,  both\r\n\r\nfinancially  and  mentally.   We  are  living  in  a   healthier\r\n\r\ncondition  and we are having a longer lifespan.   So  we  should\r\n\r\nencourage the habit of saving and investment.  I think  just  to\r\n\r\nrely  on  CPF  alone would be very foolish.   It  would  not  be\r\n\r\nsufficient.   What  we  ought to do is to  encourage  ourselves,\r\n\r\ninstead of spending on things which are not essential, to invest\r\n\r\nour  savings, and I am glad that the Government is relaxing  the\r\n\r\nrules on CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mentally, we must let the older Singaporeans, our\r\n\r\nsenior citizens, know that they are not unwanted by society.  We\r\n\r\nmust  take care of them.  All of us are going to be old one day.\r\n\r\nAnd it is an on-going process, especially for those who are sick\r\n\r\nand  infirm.  We must take special care, and health care is very\r\n\r\nessential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area which I think we have not paid enough attention,\r\n\r\nSir, is housing.  Especially on public housing, we have to think\r\n\r\nof  how  to  integrate the retiree village, if we are  going  to\r\n\r\nbuild  one.   It should not be isolated somewhere  outside.   It\r\n\r\nshould be an integral part of the housing scheme, so that  these\r\n\r\npeople would feel that they are wanted in the community.  It  is\r\n\r\nsad  to  say  in  some countries, it is isolated  and  is  never\r\n\r\npopular.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best thing is to keep our old at home. But there may\r\n\r\nbe  situations, Sir, and I agree, that we may have to send  them\r\n\r\nelsewhere, ie, home for the aged or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nretiree  village.   I would urge the Minister  to  persuade  his\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Minister for National Development,  to  look  at\r\n\r\nhousing  which is very important.  I know we are concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe  health aspect, but I think housing is an essential part  of\r\n\r\nthe whole retiring process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> The topic I would like to talk\r\n\r\nabout is coordination of the aged programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call to make preparation for an aged population has\r\n\r\nbeen  very  successful.  At present, senior citizens  programmes\r\n\r\nmushroom  in the community where both the Government-led  bodies\r\n\r\nand  the non-profit organisations are providing different  types\r\n\r\nof  services  and  facilities for the aged population.   In  the\r\n\r\nResidents'  Committee level, we build senior citizens'  corners.\r\n\r\nWe  also have the senior citizens' club in the community centre.\r\n\r\nThey  organise activities to brighten up the life of our  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens.   At the MCD level, they run homes for the  aged.   In\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Health,  they deal with  the  development  of\r\n\r\nmedicine  for the aged and other preventive medicine to  prepare\r\n\r\nfor an aging society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this moment, there is a lack of coordination\r\n\r\nbetween all the said organisations.  This is especially true for\r\n\r\nthe level of work in the RCs and the community clubs.  There are\r\n\r\norganisations at the moment which merely run the centres to keep\r\n\r\nthe  senior  citizens occupied, but activities  are  limited  to\r\n\r\nsocial  programmes,  like  outings,  shopping,  tea-tasting,  or\r\n\r\nkaraoke   sessions.   By  right,  they  should  conduct  certain\r\n\r\nactivities,  like physical exercises, physiotherapy, introducing\r\n\r\npreventive medicine, care for friends who recover from  sickness\r\n\r\nand counselling, or conducting courses to deal with the problems\r\n\r\nof  the  aged  and  retirement.   However,  due  to  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nprofessional knowledge of the leadership of this level of  work,\r\n\r\nand  the  present coordinating body is not able to provide  such\r\n\r\nprofessional  support,  they  are  not  able  to  play  a   more\r\n\r\nconstructive role to benefit the aged members, except  confining\r\n\r\nthemselves to only social activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for all these front-line organisations to play a\r\n\r\nmore  constructive role, and to cover a wider and  comprehensive\r\n\r\nkind  of  activities,  they  should be  supervised,  guided  and\r\n\r\nsupported  by  a  body which has the resources  or  professional\r\n\r\nsupport  for  the  aged.  At this moment,  there  are  too  many\r\n\r\norganisations involved in the aged programme.  They include MOH,\r\n\r\nMCD and the PA, and my colleagues just now mentioned that HDB is\r\n\r\ninvolved in providing housing.  We should actually pool all  the\r\n\r\npossible  resources  from  the  relevant  departments   of   the\r\n\r\ndifferent  interested parties by setting up a  unit  in  MCD  to\r\n\r\ngather   views,   provide   better  coordination,   offer   more\r\n\r\nprofessional  support and cater to the shortage of manpower,  as\r\n\r\nmentioned by other Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the combined professional expertise from such a\r\n\r\nmerger,  I believe that we could do a much better job in serving\r\n\r\nthe aged population.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore is one of the countries where the population ages most\r\n\r\nrapidly.   In  1980,  only  7.5% of the population,  or  173,400\r\n\r\npersons  were aged 60 and above. The number  rose to 305,300  or\r\n\r\n10%  of the population in 1996.  It is estimated that the number\r\n\r\nwill rise to 900,000 or 20% of the population by the year 2030.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the problem of an aging population is something we\r\n\r\ncannot  neglect.  We should make sure that the  aged  are  cared\r\n\r\nfor,  and  the young are properly deployed for the good  of  the\r\n\r\nsociety.   In  fact,  our  Government  has  not  forgotten   the\r\n\r\nsacrifices  and  contributions made by these old people  towards\r\n\r\nour   social   and   economic  development.    Many   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and organisations have launched quite a  number  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes for the aged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, economically, our CPF system is providing\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  with  financial security after  their  retirement.\r\n\r\nWhether  it is health care, housing, family protection or  asset\r\n\r\nenhancement, the Government has shown great care and concern  to\r\n\r\nprovide Singaporeans with all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  needs  after  retirement.   Recently,   HDB  proposed  to\r\n\r\nprovide senior citizen apartments for them to apply and to  live\r\n\r\nin.   The People's Association and the  grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nof   the   various   constituencies   are   conducting   various\r\n\r\nrecreational, cultural and sports activities on a regular  basis\r\n\r\nfor  the  senior citizens who are still healthy  and  fit.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Community  Development  has  set  up  a  \"National\r\n\r\nFamilies and Aged People's Consultative Committee\" to look  into\r\n\r\nthe   needs  of  the  senior  citizens  in  Singapore.      Some\r\n\r\ncharitable  organisations have also set up day-care centres  and\r\n\r\ncommunity hospitals for the benefit of these old people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board deals with housing and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Community Development deals with setting up  of\r\n\r\nhomes  for  the aged while the Health Ministry looks  after  the\r\n\r\nhealthcare  of  the  aged.   A few  days  ago,  we  debated  the\r\n\r\nimportance of training for our workforce.  I must say  that  the\r\n\r\nproblems of an aging population are equally important.   Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Government could set up a \"Life Planning Ministry\"  or  the\r\n\r\nMCD  could set up a special unit to deal with and coordinate all\r\n\r\nefforts  by the various quarters to help the old people.   There\r\n\r\nshould  be  a centralised body to coordinate all the efforts  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect.  Otherwise, there may be duplication  of  efforts\r\n\r\nand  thereby resulting in wastage of resources.  If we have such\r\n\r\na  body,  the  problems of the aged can be  divided  into  food,\r\n\r\nclothing,  housing  and  transport.  Most  of  the  aged  people\r\n\r\nreceive  support  from their children.  If possible,  this  body\r\n\r\nshould  provide counselling to the aged and train them to  carry\r\n\r\non  working  for  as  long  as possible  so  that  they  can  be\r\n\r\neconomically independent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the changes in our family pattern, most children\r\n\r\nmove  out  to form their own families once they get married  and\r\n\r\nboth  husband  and  wife  go  out to  work  to  make  a  living.\r\n\r\nTherefore, looking after the aged is a problem.  Some charitable\r\n\r\norganisations  have set up some day-care centres to  look  after\r\n\r\nthese  aged people.  At night, these aged people can go back  to\r\n\r\ntheir homes.  I think we should not send them to a home for  the\r\n\r\naged.  Although they are provided with food, this is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhealthy  and  it  is  very  cruel to  send  them  to  the  home.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is  important that we  should  set  up  day-care\r\n\r\ncentres  and  convalescence centres.  We  should  encourage  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector to set up such centres to look after the aged.  I\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the  Government to provide  enough  funds  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose, so that more such centres can be set up. With the  help\r\n\r\nof the private sector, we can do  better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for housing, although we plan to build senior citizen\r\n\r\napartments for them,  can we ask the PA to plan some activities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  home nursing to look after those who are sick  and  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  to take care of  certain basic chores, eg, preparing\r\n\r\ntea  or cooking porridge for them?  Through the CDCs, PA and the\r\n\r\nMCD  can also arrange for more activities for these aged people,\r\n\r\nnot only recreational and cultural activities, but some care and\r\n\r\nconcern for them, particularly those who are handicapped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I am concerned with is education and moral\r\n\r\nvalues.   During   the past few months, MCD launched  some  mass\r\n\r\nmedia  programmes.  I have received feedback  from  people  that\r\n\r\nthese  programmes  are  very good.  They  depicted  episodes  of\r\n\r\ndisputes  between  the  parents-in-law and daughters-in-law  and\r\n\r\nproblems  such as the lack of respect for parents.  I hope  that\r\n\r\nMCD would do more in this respect. MCD should liaise with TCS to\r\n\r\nproduce more of such programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that we should psychologically prepare\r\n\r\nour  aged people.  Recently, in my constituency, we have  looked\r\n\r\ninto  the  psychological needs of such aged  people.   The  aged\r\n\r\npeople  have  slowly  become senile.  Certain  disputes  between\r\n\r\nparents-in-law   and   daughters-in-law   are   due   to   their\r\n\r\npsychological  make-up.   We do not understand  their  problems.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in a day-centre in my constituency, there are  one\r\n\r\nor  two  older people who are constantly complaining that   they\r\n\r\nhad  no  food to eat, but the folks there told us that they  had\r\n\r\nalready  taken  their meals.   Whenever they see a  car  driving\r\n\r\nnear the centre, they would say they want to go home.  In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances like this, our  young people should be educated on\r\n\r\nhow  to  look  after  the  older  people.   So  through  certain\r\n\r\ngrassroots  activities, if we can have the hardware as  well  as\r\n\r\nthe  software, and if we can set up a special body to coordinate\r\n\r\nall  the efforts, I think we can certainly  do better in looking\r\n\r\nafter the older folks among us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, the hon. Members before me have\r\n\r\npointed  out  that we do have an aging population.   As  I  look\r\n\r\naround  this House, I suspect that this House is probably greyer\r\n\r\nthan  it has been any time in its history.  In any case, I  know\r\n\r\nfor  a  fact  that  the average age for the 23 freshmen  MPs  is\r\n\r\nhigher  than it has ever been before.  We therefore clearly  are\r\n\r\naging  as  a nation.  And I agree with Dr Vasoo that  we  should\r\n\r\ndedicate  more funds for MCD to deal with the problems faced  by\r\n\r\nan  aging community.  What is being done, what will be done,  to\r\n\r\nprepare Singaporeans for the day that they too will grow old and\r\n\r\nto  position our social structures to cope with that change.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister to update us on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further question is: would these plans be affected by the\r\n\r\nmore  austere  budget  necessitated by  the  regional  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to move to my next cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> I wish to talk of bonds and the breaking\r\n\r\nof  bonds.  But before you rule me out of order, I must  quickly\r\n\r\nadd  that the bonds I am talking about are the social and family\r\n\r\nbonds which are the glue that holds our nation together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is trite to say that the family is the building block of\r\n\r\nthe nation, and that for the family to stay together we need  to\r\n\r\neducate our young to respect their elders, to honour them and to\r\n\r\nlook  at  them  as the repositories of the wisdom which  is  our\r\n\r\nnation's resources and treasure.  Too often, however, we pay lip\r\n\r\nservices to these principles.  Or perhaps we do not know how  to\r\n\r\nbe practical in teaching our young how to honour their elders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most practical and eminent ways in which we can\r\n\r\nshow we care and respect our elders is to acknowledge their past\r\n\r\ncontributions.   They have toiled to give us  the  Singapore  we\r\n\r\nhave  today.   They  did  not, as a rule,  obtain  the  material\r\n\r\nbenefits  we  gain  today  in doing  the  same  thing.   We  can\r\n\r\nacknowledge  their  past contributions  by  praising  them,  but\r\n\r\npraise is not tangible and does not impact the young mind on the\r\n\r\nseriousness with which we praise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not change the minds of the young, we will be\r\n\r\nguilty  of planting the seeds which would cause a break  in  our\r\n\r\nsocial  bonds.  Would it not be possible for the small  kindness\r\n\r\nmovement,  for  example,  to  extend  to  the  giving  of   more\r\n\r\nconcessions  to  the  elderly?  First, we  can  extend  the  bus\r\n\r\nconcessions  we have given them by lifting restrictions  on  the\r\n\r\nroutes and on the time of use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we can encourage both public and private sectors to\r\n\r\nrealise  that  concessions  to  the  elderly  are  not  entirely\r\n\r\nsubsidies  but a show of gratitude and also good business.   The\r\n\r\ngoodwill  gained, the lessons imparted to the young,  the  extra\r\n\r\nmoney  earned  from  the increased volume of  repeat  visits  or\r\n\r\npurchases  by  the  elderly - these are, I submit,  of  greatest\r\n\r\nvalue to us on the whole.  Many places such as the museums,  art\r\n\r\nfestival  performances, SSO concerts, perhaps the tourist  spots\r\n\r\nwhich  are  currently  languishing, and the  cinemas  which  are\r\n\r\nflourishing on the other hand, these can all benefit  from  such\r\n\r\nconcessions.   There  is  a  ready market  out  there  which  is\r\n\r\ncurrently   being   tapped  only  by  conmen  selling   magnetic\r\n\r\nmattresses and spurious investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there can be centres put up at, say, community\r\n\r\ncentres,  or  some other centres, like what Dr Neo  said,  which\r\n\r\nwould  take  care  of the elderly.  Perhaps  at  these  centres,\r\n\r\nbesides giving them activities to do, we could also provide them\r\n\r\nwith  opportunities  to buy daily necessities  at  concessionary\r\n\r\nrates and the marketers who sell such products and services  can\r\n\r\nbenefit by saving the cost which they pay for overheads, such as\r\n\r\nrental, advertising\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand middlemen's commissions.  Government should take the lead by\r\n\r\noffering concessions for the elderly in Government-run places of\r\n\r\ninterest and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us stop thanking and praising our elders only and start\r\n\r\ngiving  them  some practical help to alleviate  their  sometimes\r\n\r\nprecarious financial conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, in the year 2030, Mr\r\n\r\nS. Iswaran, the youngest Member of this House, would be 68 years\r\n\r\nold  if  he told me the truth about his age.  He will then  join\r\n\r\nthe  ranks  of the senior citizens, those who are 60  years  and\r\n\r\nabove.   This  group  which  now constitutes  about  9%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  will increase to about 25% in the year 2030.   After\r\n\r\nleading  a  successful life as an economist at MTI, a  corporate\r\n\r\nexecutive at Singapore Technologies and as a Parliamentarian, Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran in 2030 would be deemed to be in his twilight years.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, my son would be 35 years old then, at the  prime\r\n\r\nof  his life and probably doing things which are different  from\r\n\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ratio of working adults to senior citizens would be\r\n\r\n3:1, decreasing from the ratio of 10:1.  We have heard all these\r\n\r\nstatistics   earlier.   With  life  expectancy  increasing   and\r\n\r\nmarriage  and child births taking place later in life, Singapore\r\n\r\nin  2030  is  expected to have three or even  four  generational\r\n\r\nfamilies.  What does all this mean for us today?  We have  heard\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore is a rapidly aging society.  We  are  a  country\r\n\r\nwhich  caters to the young today.  Can we do the same  30  years\r\n\r\nfrom now?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senior citizens of tomorrow, such as Mr Iswaran, Mr\r\n\r\nChan  Soo Sen, Dr Toh See Kiat, myself and many others  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  would be mobile, highly skilled and literate and by  all\r\n\r\naccounts  will value our personal independence.  The demands  of\r\n\r\nthis  group and those of my son would be different and  must  be\r\n\r\nattended to.  How then do we cater to a group which is seen as a\r\n\r\nspent  force and a group which is seen as the engine of  growth?\r\n\r\nAre  these descriptions appropriate or even meaningful  in  this\r\n\r\ncontext?  How do we cater to the likes of Mr Iswaran and company\r\n\r\nwho\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspend  their adult life building a Singapore for my son and  his\r\n\r\ngeneration?   There  are many implications to  this  demographic\r\n\r\nscenario.  For example, there will be more of the aged including\r\n\r\nnon-ambulant  cases requiring care.  Whose responsibility  would\r\n\r\nit  be  then to take care of the sick aged?  Studies have shown,\r\n\r\nfor  example, that senior citizens' response time during driving\r\n\r\nwould be eight times longer than that of a younger person.  Will\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  obligate senior citizens to retake  their  driving\r\n\r\ntests then?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the implications that both Mr Chan and I\r\n\r\nare  looking at as part of the Singapore 21 Committee.  I do not\r\n\r\nintend  to  elaborate here our findings.   But  there  are  some\r\n\r\nconcerns that I would like to share.  Many whom we have met have\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  there is a glaring need for a national  focused\r\n\r\napproach to the problem of aging.  Some have even suggested that\r\n\r\na  Ministry of the Old be set up to take care of the aged.  I am\r\n\r\nnot  sure  whether they envision a young or an old man  to  head\r\n\r\nthis  Ministry.  I do not think that these are wise suggestions.\r\n\r\nBut  underlying  these  suggestions is a  concern  that  somehow\r\n\r\nsociety does not seem to care for the old.  An elderly gentleman\r\n\r\nin  fact  said  that  it is better to die  than  to  be  old  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We have to change this view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, that is a problem of perception or \"agism\", to use\r\n\r\nthe term coined to describe prejudice and discrimination against\r\n\r\nthe  elderly.  Do we view the old as a spent force and therefore\r\n\r\nnot  provide resources for them?  I do not think Mr  Iswaran  at\r\n\r\nthe age of 68 will be a spent force.  If anything, I am sure  he\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to contribute as long as he is healthy.  Clearly,\r\n\r\nwe  should move away from the definition of the aged than ignore\r\n\r\nthe need for independence among the healthy old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the greying of Singapore, we will need to address the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  two  groups,  the independent  healthy  old  and  the\r\n\r\ndependent frail old.  We must begin to view both the old and the\r\n\r\nyoung   as   resources,  each  with  their  own  abilities   and\r\n\r\ncapabilities.  Society needs to provide opportunities for people\r\n\r\nof any age group\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  contribute  economically or to volunteer their  services  as\r\n\r\nlong  as they are willing to do so.  In fact, studies have shown\r\n\r\nthat  those who continue to live a healthy and active life  tend\r\n\r\nto have less medical problems.  Societal norms will also have to\r\n\r\nchange  to  reflect this move away from treating the elderly  as\r\n\r\nthough they were children or senile.  Studies have shown that  a\r\n\r\nsingle elderly who remarries tends to live longer and healthier.\r\n\r\nBut  second  marriages  will carry other  implications  for  the\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we cannot ignore the problems of\r\n\r\ndependency  among the sick and frail elderly.  Many  today  have\r\n\r\nraised  the  concerns  about  this group.   Their  numbers  will\r\n\r\nincrease  in  future and they will also live longer  in  various\r\n\r\nstages of dependency.  What can we do now to help this group  of\r\n\r\npersons in the future?  Sir, could the Minister inform the House\r\n\r\nof the current thinking in MCD concerning this problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah\r\n\r\nTarmugi):   Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to step in  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture to answer Members.  I have decided to speak now because\r\n\r\nI  think the problem of the aged is a very serious one,  as  has\r\n\r\nbeen  mentioned earlier by many Members.  And I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nthank Members for their very generous support by calling on  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance to give more funds to my Ministry.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister will hear these plaintive cries and  do  the\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of the aged is a very important one.\r\n\r\nSeveral  Members  have  mentioned the  proportion  of  the  aged\r\n\r\nincreasing between now and the next century and how fast we  are\r\n\r\naging.   In  one  study, it was stated that we are  the  fastest\r\n\r\naging  community in Asia, surpassing even Japan.  In  1997,  the\r\n\r\naged  65 years and above in Singapore was 7% and it was forecast\r\n\r\nthat  by 2018, the proportion will double to 14%.  It took Japan\r\n\r\nabout  26 years to achieve the same increase.  But it will  take\r\n\r\nus only 21 years.  So that gives a broad idea of the seriousness\r\n\r\nof  the  issue of the aged and how we want to handle the  future\r\n\r\nwhen many of us, including Mr Iswaran, will be getting old,  and\r\n\r\nhow our children will handle their future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aging, Sir, is an inevitability. So we must prepare for\r\n\r\nit.   I  agree with Members that it is indeed a major  challenge\r\n\r\nfor  our  community  and  everyone, and  I  mean  everyone,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the community, the VWOs and corporations, will  have\r\n\r\nto put their minds together and look for solutions which will be\r\n\r\nbest  for  our community.  The issues and challenges are  multi-faceted.  They are very wide-ranging and we have to plan and lay\r\n\r\nthe  infrastructure  to  meet the needs  and  aspirations  of  a\r\n\r\ngrowing number of better educated aged, as mentioned earlier  by\r\n\r\nDr  Yaacob.   Their needs will be different.  Their  aspirations\r\n\r\nwill  be  different from the elders now, from  our  fathers  and\r\n\r\nindeed from even our own aspirations.  So we will have to  think\r\n\r\nof  what we have to do to fulfil these aspirations, concerns and\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current approach now, Sir, is to draw the expertise of\r\n\r\nthe  various Ministries in planning and providing facilities and\r\n\r\nservices  to  the  aged and there are very  close  consultations\r\n\r\namong these various Ministries.  My Ministry, for example,  also\r\n\r\nworks  closely  with HDB, the Ministry of National  Development,\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Labour.   We  have\r\n\r\nclose consultation at various levels in our Ministries.  So from\r\n\r\npolicy  conceptualisation to programme implementation, there  is\r\n\r\nvery  close consultation and this approach has served  us  well.\r\n\r\nBut  as the number of the aged grows, so will the impact on  the\r\n\r\nrest  of the society.  Therefore, we would need to look  at  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  the  aged holistically and comprehensively  and  an\r\n\r\nintegrated approach be taken in our national response to address\r\n\r\nthe needs, concerns and aspirations of our aged population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also merit in having one agency, be it a Ministry\r\n\r\nor  department,  to  take  a lead role in  coordinating  and  in\r\n\r\nputting  things  together to ensure that  there  is  a  seamless\r\n\r\nprovision of service and a continuum of service being  given  to\r\n\r\nthe  aged.   The lead agency, among other things, will  have  to\r\n\r\nprovide  overall  strategic  direction  and  policies  for   the\r\n\r\nelderly,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  ensure  a  very coordinated response across Ministries  and\r\n\r\nacross  programmes,  and  ensure that  there  is  inter-Ministry\r\n\r\ncoordination on issues of the aged which do not fall  under  any\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been examining ways to further enhance\r\n\r\npolicy  coordination and policy development, and we are  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of re-evaluating our approach in dealing with the  aged\r\n\r\nand  exploring the feasibility of my Ministry assuming the  role\r\n\r\nof the lead agency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will review our resources. We will review the expertise\r\n\r\nthat we need, the steps that we have to take before we make  any\r\n\r\nrecommendations and before we offer ourselves to  take  on  this\r\n\r\nlead  role.  But whatever structure we take, whatever we decide,\r\n\r\nwe  must  continue to help the elderly to lead meaningful  lives\r\n\r\nand to contribute to society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two basic philosophies which we hold. One is\r\n\r\nthat  the  aged  should  be encouraged  to  live  healthily,  be\r\n\r\nfinancially independent, be socially active for as long as  they\r\n\r\ncan,  and  the Government holds on to this philosophy to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat   our  aged  are  healthy  and  that  they  will  keep   on\r\n\r\ncontributing to the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second philosophy is that the aged should preferably\r\n\r\nlive  within  the  community, integrated in  the  community  and\r\n\r\npreferably also with their families.  As far as possible, we try\r\n\r\nto avoid putting and shunting our aged in institutions away from\r\n\r\nthe community.  I think this would answer Mr Rai's concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have to pay attention to the specific difficulties\r\n\r\nof  the care givers, the family members' trials and tribulations\r\n\r\nto take care of the aged, especially the frail aged and the sick\r\n\r\naged,  and  we  will  have  to  ensure  that  there  are  enough\r\n\r\nfacilities and community support to help the carers of the  aged\r\n\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go to Mrs Yu-Foo's suggestions. She has many\r\n\r\ngood  suggestions which I will ask my officials  to  look  into.\r\n\r\nShe  also  emphasises  the  need for coordination,  and  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier  that we also accept that principle,  and  we\r\n\r\nwill indeed be looking into how we can coordinate our programmes\r\n\r\nand our projects better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made one suggestion about more private enterprises\r\n\r\ncoming into the scene to provide facilities or services for  the\r\n\r\naged,  and  asking for Government support, preferably  financial\r\n\r\nsupport,  for this.  Personally, I am reluctant to  give  direct\r\n\r\nfinancial support, especially to private enterprises,  when  the\r\n\r\nmotive is profit.  But if the private enterprise or organisation\r\n\r\ncan  come  out  to  say that they are willing  to  provide  some\r\n\r\nwelfare  services, we will consider the kind of support that  we\r\n\r\ncan give them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go to Dr Lily Neo and her issues and concerns on\r\n\r\nthe  BASC.  The Ministry would like to thank Dr Lily Neo for her\r\n\r\nconstant  support of the Ministry's programmes,  especially  for\r\n\r\nthe  BASC,  and now the new institutions which she  calls  CARE.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  may wish to know that there are 82 non-profit  BASC\r\n\r\ncentres  as  at February this year, providing a total  of  5,890\r\n\r\nplaces.  Another 75 centres are run by private operators,  which\r\n\r\nare  different  from  non-profit organisations.    The  Ministry\r\n\r\nplans  to  build another 74 non-profit BASC centres by the  year\r\n\r\n2000,  and this will bring the total number of non-profit  BASCs\r\n\r\nto  156 and the number of places to 10,400.   We feel that  this\r\n\r\nwill be sufficient for our needs until 2000.  If need be and  if\r\n\r\nwe  find that demand is more than what we have supplied, we will\r\n\r\ndefinitely look into building more BASCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for CARE, as Members are aware, there are two types of\r\n\r\nday care programmes for the elderly.  One is the social day care\r\n\r\ncentres (SDCs) which come under the purview of my Ministry,  and\r\n\r\nthe other is the day rehabilitation centres which come under the\r\n\r\npurview of the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are six social day care centres offering a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  207  places with a utilisation  rate  of  about  80%.\r\n\r\nAnother  10 SDCs are in the pipeline and these can offer another\r\n\r\n500 places.  If there is demand, my Ministry will certainly look\r\n\r\ninto it and, if necessary, we will build more SDCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the rehabilitation centres, there are currently 17\r\n\r\ncentres  catering  to  the  frail and elderly  sick,  and  three\r\n\r\ncatering to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose suffering from senile dementia.  Together, they provide  a\r\n\r\ntotal of 700 places.  The average utilisation rate is about 60%.\r\n\r\nAnother  four  centres with 120 places are in the pipeline,  and\r\n\r\nthere  are  also  plans  to set up at least  another  eight  new\r\n\r\ncentres by the year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware that the health of the elderly vacillates\r\n\r\nbetween progress and regress, and they change from one state  to\r\n\r\nanother.  As such, every effort is made to try to site the  SDCs\r\n\r\nnear  to day rehabilitation centres, so that the elderly can  be\r\n\r\nconveniently  transferred from one facility to  another  with  a\r\n\r\nminimum  of  fuss, and with convenience for their families.   We\r\n\r\nwill also continuously strive to provide a more coordinated  and\r\n\r\nintegrated  day  care programme to cater to  the  well  elderly,\r\n\r\nfrail elderly and elderly with disabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo proposes that BASC centres and Centres of\r\n\r\nActivities  for the Retired and Elderly (CARE) to  be  sited  in\r\n\r\ncommunity centres.   The Member may be pleased to know that both\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association and my Ministry support this proposal.\r\n\r\nThe  PA,  through  the  CDCs, will continue  to  facilitate  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of such centres at the community centres jointly with\r\n\r\nvoluntary  welfare organisations in areas where there is  demand\r\n\r\nfor  such services.  But the Member should understand that these\r\n\r\nwill also have to take into account the competing demands in the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres.  Nevertheless, we support this proposal  and\r\n\r\nwe will pursue it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai mentioned the Howe Yoon Chong Report and\r\n\r\nhow  he  regretted that it was not given the attention  that  it\r\n\r\nshould  be given.  The Member may wish to know that contrary  to\r\n\r\nwhat   the   Member  believes,  the  Government  indeed   places\r\n\r\nimportance on the recommendations of the Howe Yoon Chong Report.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the major initiative which I can mention  is  the\r\n\r\npublic  education  efforts to change public  perception  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly  and encourage the elderly to be physically healthy  and\r\n\r\nsocially  and  mentally  active.  That has  become  one  of  our\r\n\r\nphilosophies on how the elderly should proceed through life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another recommendation of the Howe Yoon Chong Report was\r\n\r\nthe employment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  aged.  This was reinforced by the Advisory Council  for\r\n\r\nthe  Aged  in  1988 which led to the legislation to  extend  the\r\n\r\nretirement age to 62, and later perhaps to 67.  So the Howe Yoon\r\n\r\nChong Report has been given the due regard that it deserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to retirement planning, I cannot agree more\r\n\r\nwith  the Member that retirement planning is important.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nwe  have  been advocating the retirement planning concept  since\r\n\r\n1987  when we launched the public education programme on  aging.\r\n\r\nThe  importance  of  pre-retirement planning is  promoted  among\r\n\r\nemployers in the workplace, and seminars are organised with  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  also with other agencies such as  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Employers' Federation.  And  quite apart  from  making\r\n\r\nemployers  aware of the need for their employees to prepare  for\r\n\r\nretirement,  we  also help employees to prepare for  retirement.\r\n\r\nThis  is  equally  or not more important, that  we  prepare  the\r\n\r\nemployee  himself or herself for retirement.  My Ministry  works\r\n\r\nwith  agencies like the People's Association and other VWOs  and\r\n\r\nalso   SAGE   to  provide  pre-retirees  with  information   for\r\n\r\nretirement planning.  In the coming year, my Ministry will  also\r\n\r\nbe  working with the Ministry of Labour's Back-to-Work programme\r\n\r\nto reach out to more people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to support services for the aged, there are\r\n\r\nmany  services  already  set up for  the  aged.   Let  me  touch\r\n\r\nspecifically on an important but often neglected aspect, ie, the\r\n\r\nsocial and emotional needs of the elderly.  Quite naturally, the\r\n\r\nfamily  plays an important role in fulfilling the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nelderly,  and  they  always benefit from  being  in  the  family\r\n\r\nsetting.  Our public education efforts encourage the family  and\r\n\r\nsociety  to respect and help the elderly to have a role and  for\r\n\r\nthe  elderly to use the opportunities around them to  help  them\r\n\r\nlead meaningful lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move to Prof. Low Seow Chay's topic. I thank\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Chua Chu Kang for his comments on the  services\r\n\r\nfor the elderly.  There are indeed a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvariety  of  services and programmes  -  I have  mentioned  some\r\n\r\njust now - provided for the elderly by the different VWOs.   The\r\n\r\nvery  fact  that there are different VWOs and many of  them  are\r\n\r\nproviding services should not be construed as a haphazard way of\r\n\r\ndoing things and unprofessionally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are different categories of elderly persons - the\r\n\r\nwell  elderly, the frail elderly and non-ambulant elderly.   And\r\n\r\nthe  needs  of these different categories of elderly people  are\r\n\r\ndifferent.   So  we  need different bodies or  organisations  to\r\n\r\nprovide specifically for their needs.  Some prefer opportunities\r\n\r\nfor informal and unstructured activities and interaction, whilst\r\n\r\nothers   prefer   more  formal  and  organized  activities   and\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   There are three specific goals in the delivery  of\r\n\r\nservices  and  programmes.  One is to help  the  elderly  remain\r\n\r\nphysically, mentally and socially active; two, to make available\r\n\r\na  continuum in the variety of care and support for the elderly;\r\n\r\nand  third, to run services and programmes based on the  concept\r\n\r\nof the family as social insurance in the care of the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Senior Citizens Corners, for example. They may not\r\n\r\nlook  much.  All you need are some tables and chairs in a corner\r\n\r\nwhere  senior citizens would drop by, congregate and just  chat,\r\n\r\nperhaps  having  a  drink or two.  It may seem  unstructured  or\r\n\r\ninformal,  but  these are the things which the  senior  citizens\r\n\r\nneed.  They do not want any structured activities.  They do  not\r\n\r\nneed anything which is structured or formal.  All they need is a\r\n\r\nplace  to  come down to every time they feel like  it,  to  meet\r\n\r\ntheir friends, to chat, to exchange gossips, to talk about their\r\n\r\nchildren,  grandchildren,  or whatever.   So  there  are  indeed\r\n\r\nvarious  needs.   Some  senior  citizens  will  need  such  very\r\n\r\ninformal activities while others will need the more formal  ones\r\n\r\nwhich  are to be held in community centres or organised  by  the\r\n\r\nvarious welfare organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each voluntary welfare organisation has got its own mission\r\n\r\nand  expertise.   It is better for us to leave  it  to  them  to\r\n\r\nexercise  this  mission and expertise, because they  are  better\r\n\r\nplaced to provide the services\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich they know best and which they are very committed to.  So I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  it  is  wise for us to  organise  all  of  them,\r\n\r\nstructure  them  so tightly that they have no freedom  to  move,\r\n\r\nthat  they  do  not  have the initiatives to come  up  with  new\r\n\r\nprogrammes and ideas to serve the elderly.  But I do agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  Member  that  there is certainly room  for  improvement  in\r\n\r\nintegrating  the  programmes  and  services  to  ensure  a  more\r\n\r\ncoordinated  and better approach.  Indeed we would also  try  to\r\n\r\nhelp VWOs where the management is rather weak, so that they  can\r\n\r\noperate   better  and  have  better  programmes  to  serve   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to coordination, one step which we have taken\r\n\r\nis  the formation of three networks.  I do not know whether  the\r\n\r\nMember  has heard about this, but we have formed three  networks\r\n\r\nalong  regional lines to coordinate services for the elderly  in\r\n\r\nthe  Western Sector, Central Sector and Eastern Sector.  In this\r\n\r\nnetwork system, a lead agency coordinates the activities of  the\r\n\r\nother  agencies to promote community and geriatric  care,  which\r\n\r\nmeans there are some professional inputs here and some expertise\r\n\r\nbeing brought into play in the organisation of the activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Community Care Network led by NCSS, with\r\n\r\nthe participation of MCD and MOH, addresses the issue of service\r\n\r\nfragmentation, service gaps and barriers to service utilization.\r\n\r\nThen  there  is  geriatric care.  Ministry of  Health  chairs  a\r\n\r\nCoordinating Committee involving MCD and NCSS also,  to  monitor\r\n\r\nsupply  and  demand  for  geriatric  care,  develop  and  review\r\n\r\noperational  procedures and promote coordination  among  service\r\n\r\nproviders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More will be done to form inter-ministry and inter-agency\r\n\r\ncommittees  so  that networks can be formed  to  coordinate  and\r\n\r\nmonitor the programmes better.  So we will indeed follow up with\r\n\r\nthe Member's suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to Dr Toh See Kiat on concessions for the\r\n\r\nelderly.  The Member suggested that MCD play a more active\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrole in persuading organisations to provide concessions for  the\r\n\r\nelderly.   Let me assure the Member that we have been  doing  so\r\n\r\nand  we  will  continue  to  do so.   There  are  two  types  of\r\n\r\nconcessions that the Member may wish to know.  One  is  for  the\r\n\r\ngeneral   population  of  elderly  persons.   In  other   words,\r\n\r\neligibility  is  based purely on age.  It applies  to  all  aged\r\n\r\npersons.   The  other  pertains to  services  used  by  selected\r\n\r\nelderly  such  as those for day-care centres and  rehabilitative\r\n\r\nservices.   Concessions are given to the elderly,  for  example,\r\n\r\nfor  admissions  to museums, the Zoo, Sentosa,  Science  Centre,\r\n\r\nBird Park, Night Safari and concessions for public transport and\r\n\r\nentry  into  sports facilities managed by the  Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil.  So the array of concession facilities is indeed  many,\r\n\r\nand we will try to multiply the number in time to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member that my Ministry will\r\n\r\npursue the question of increasing the number of concessions, not\r\n\r\nonly  to  what we have now, but also increasing the  quality  of\r\n\r\nconcessions.   For example, previously they could only  go  into\r\n\r\none  class but maybe we could ask for concessions for  a  higher\r\n\r\nclass.  We will continue to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> The Minister has not responded to my point on\r\n\r\nassistance  for retrenched workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> My apologies. Dr Vasoo and Mr\r\n\r\nShriniwas  Rai asked about it.  At the moment, we  do  not  have\r\n\r\nspecific  programmes or specific projects to help the retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers.   In our view, the best and most enduring help  we  can\r\n\r\ngive  to  retrenched workers is to find them jobs  and  also  to\r\n\r\ntrain  them for jobs so that they can get new jobs if they  want\r\n\r\nto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, the NTUC and the Ministry of Labour have put\r\n\r\nin  place several measures to help retrenched workers.  This has\r\n\r\nbeen  announced  and Members may wish to know that  my  Ministry\r\n\r\nalso  has  some  help  for such workers.  We  have  in  fact  an\r\n\r\ninterest-free  loan  scheme  for  skills  training  and   skills\r\n\r\nupgrading for low income workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough  this  is for low income workers, this  can  be  easily\r\n\r\nextended to retrenched workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This loan actually complements the training award schemes\r\n\r\nwhich the various self-help groups now administer.  Workers  who\r\n\r\nwish  to undergo skills training but cannot afford the cost  can\r\n\r\nbe  assisted under these schemes.  Members may wish to know that\r\n\r\napplication  forms are available in all the service counters  of\r\n\r\nthe  community  self-help  groups  and  also  at  CDC  counters,\r\n\r\ncommunity  clubs and town councils.  For those  who  still  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  paying  the balance of  the  course  fees  after\r\n\r\nreceiving  the  skills training, the community self-help  groups\r\n\r\nwill  submit the names of these people who have problems  direct\r\n\r\nto my Ministry for interest-free loans.  In other words, they do\r\n\r\nnot have to apply.  The self-help groups will automatically send\r\n\r\ntheir names and we will extend the loan facilities to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked whether there is any assistance for\r\n\r\nfamily  members  of  the aged.  There are  in  place,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nvarious financial and non-financial assistance schemes, which my\r\n\r\nMinistry  and  other ministries administer, to help  individuals\r\n\r\nand  families  who  are in financial difficulty.   Some  of  the\r\n\r\nschemes include assistance in job placement through the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour and NTUC, if he or she wants to obtain a job.   There\r\n\r\nis  also  financial  assistance from funds  administered  by  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  for those in genuine hardship to help them  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies tide over the difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also assistance to meet the educational expenses\r\n\r\nand other support for school children, for example, school fees,\r\n\r\nschool  uniforms,  supplementary  fees,  through  MCD  and  also\r\n\r\nthrough the schools.  There is also assistance in linking up the\r\n\r\nelderly to service providers and support services such as  meal-help, home-help service and domiciliary nursing or medical  care\r\n\r\nservice.  So there is already assistance in place and,  if  need\r\n\r\nbe, we will multiply the number.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Council of Social Service and my Ministry,\r\n\r\nSir, are monitoring the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpact of the economy on the individuals and families.

There are differing views on this, Sir.   The\r\n\r\nyouth agencies will say that the problem is a growing one.   The\r\n\r\ncrime   control  agencies  say  that  the  problems  have   been\r\n\r\ncontained.  I assess that the problem of juvenile delinquency is\r\n\r\na  multi-faceted one.  It requires a concerted effort to  tackle\r\n\r\nthe  problems  through  the  levels  such  as  the  family,  the\r\n\r\ncommunity and the schools.  We have to take tougher measures and\r\n\r\na  more  concerted  effort at different  levels  to  tackle  the\r\n\r\nproblem.   The Children and Young Persons Act, particularly  the\r\n\r\nsection dealing with juvenile offenders, has to be revised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the school level, there have been concerns about\r\n\r\nthe  disciplinary  problems  of  students.   Many  schools  have\r\n\r\nreported  that there are juvenile delinquency problems and  they\r\n\r\nhave been trying to tackle the problems.  There is a need to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexamine whether we should ensure that there is better discipline\r\n\r\nat  the  school  level  to deal with these  problems.   What  is\r\n\r\nimportant is also to empower the teachers in the school to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the problem because we have to identify some of the  early\r\n\r\nproblems of students who are vulnerable to juvenile delinquency.\r\n\r\nThe school can play an important role and it should be empowered\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  this disciplinary problem at an early  stage  in\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask the Minister what steps are being taken to\r\n\r\nmake the Children and Young Persons Act more effective.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nhe  may  want  to  explore the possibility of  empowering  those\r\n\r\nteachers,  who are playing a policing role in school,  to  refer\r\n\r\nstudents  with  juvenile delinquency problems  to  the  juvenile\r\n\r\ncourt  so  that  the problems faced by schools  can  be  tackled\r\n\r\nearly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Directly to court?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I share the sentiments of Dr Vasoo.\r\n\r\nThe  Children and Young Persons Act needs to be amended.  It  is\r\n\r\nlong overdue and I think the Ministry is looking into it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem of social juvenile delinquency is actually\r\n\r\nnot  a  criminal  problem.  We have to go to  the  root  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem  because if we treat it as a criminal problem,  we  will\r\n\r\nsend  it  to  the  juvenile courts.  I beg to  differ  from  the\r\n\r\nopinion of criminologists and the others.  I think this is  what\r\n\r\nwe  ought  to do.  And I hope the Minister would give  this  due\r\n\r\nconsideration.   I could relate to him another issue.   He  will\r\n\r\nremember  that  when the Maintenance of Parents Bill  was  first\r\n\r\nproposed  in  this  House, there was a  proposal  that  District\r\n\r\nCourts  should hear such cases.  I and another lawyer, Mr Joshua\r\n\r\nLim,  were opposed against the whole idea and we both  wrote  to\r\n\r\nthe newspaper and appeared before the Select Committee.  I think\r\n\r\nthe problem, Sir, would have been worse if it had gone to court.\r\n\r\nI  do not want to flatter ourselves, but when Mr Choo Si Sen was\r\n\r\nhere, we had taken a different\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattitude.   Similarly, Sir, I would urge the  Minister  to  take\r\n\r\naway  the  court,  get a trained lawyer and two social  workers,\r\n\r\nform  a  tribunal and let this problem be studied  as  a  social\r\n\r\nproblem.  It is not a criminal problem, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I totally agree with Dr Vasoo that we should empower the\r\n\r\nschool,  with  the help of the Police.  I am not agreeable  with\r\n\r\nhim  as  he proposes teachers.  Let the principals decide.   The\r\n\r\nteachers  discipline  them  through  the  principal,   and   the\r\n\r\nprincipal should decide.  Just like we detain criminal  elements\r\n\r\nwithout trial, I will go further and say that these boys  should\r\n\r\nbe  taken away, send them on holiday for two weeks at the  boys'\r\n\r\nhome.   They will learn their lessons.  Unfortunately, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nboys'  home I visited with Dr Vasoo sometime back is too  harsh.\r\n\r\nDiscipline is an important aspect of reformation.  But  I  think\r\n\r\ntoo  much emphasis is being paid on the penal aspect of it.   We\r\n\r\nshould be more reformative and provide counselling.  And this is\r\n\r\nsomething we have to look at.  It is a social problem and not  a\r\n\r\ncriminal problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister and the GPC to help them out,\r\n\r\nmake a study of the legislation, see how best we can incorporate\r\n\r\nthis  into  the new era, move away from the right and wrong  and\r\n\r\nsee how we can go forward and counsel these boys and girls.   We\r\n\r\ncannot  console  ourselves that criminal  delinquency  has  been\r\n\r\nchecked.  No.  It may be tapering off there, but we have  to  go\r\n\r\nto  the root of the problem.  I think many parents, many of  us,\r\n\r\nare  not in a position to take parental control.  And I remember\r\n\r\nmeeting  a  very young boy of 13 who was there and  the  parents\r\n\r\nsaid they could not control him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what the parents refuse to do, the society may have to\r\n\r\ndo.   I urge the Minister to make a study of this problem - take\r\n\r\nit  away from the court, set up a tribunal, and give it  a  try.\r\n\r\nIf you feel it is not working, send it back to the court.  But I\r\n\r\nam  quite confident, given the opportunity and the way  we  have\r\n\r\nworked out in other agencies, that it would be worthwhile to try\r\n\r\nit out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, according to reports, the number\r\n\r\nof juvenile offenders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas,  in  fact, stabilised over the past two years.  The numbers\r\n\r\npeaked to about 2,500 in 1995, before falling to about 2,100  in\r\n\r\n1996,  and  to  2,147  in  1997.  This  is  encouraging  and  it\r\n\r\ndemonstrates   the   effectiveness  of  our   current   juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency policy.  I am sure, and this is where Mr  David  Lim\r\n\r\nwould  agree, that the ban on the admission of 16-year  olds  to\r\n\r\ntea  dances outlets must be in part responsible for this decline\r\n\r\nin offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the Inter-Ministry Committee on Juvenile\r\n\r\nDelinquency is now working with the CDCs to reach out to  school\r\n\r\ndropouts.   We  seem,  therefore, to have  the  situation  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.   However, Sir, as we have heard from  Mr  Rai  and  Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo,  the  popular  perception is, in fact,  contrary  to  the\r\n\r\npicture  presented  by  these  figures.   The  rioting  at   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Boys'  Home  on 17th December 1997  has  raised  some\r\n\r\nconcerns.  Are the programmes in place at these homes truly able\r\n\r\nto  help  the boys turn over a new leaf?  Are the boys at  these\r\n\r\nhomes  receiving  adequate counselling?   Is  there  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nresources at these homes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These concerns are not only being voiced in relation to the\r\n\r\nboys  at  these homes but also in relation to youth  now  living\r\n\r\noutside  such  institutions  and,  in  particular,  the   school\r\n\r\ndropouts.  If the boys from the homes are not helped,  they  may\r\n\r\nnegatively  influence others once they are  released  back  into\r\n\r\nsociety.   This  failure to help will ultimately feed  a  never-ending cycle of juvenile delinquency problems in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotal evidence seems also to suggest that more youths\r\n\r\nare  bolder  these days.  I was informed that during the  recent\r\n\r\nfestive seasons, there were several minor clashes between  youth\r\n\r\nand Police.  For example, near the Malay Village, several knives\r\n\r\nwere found stuck to trees and a Police officer was slashed by  a\r\n\r\nyouth after he resisted arrest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this context, could the Minister enlighten the\r\n\r\nHouse  on what preventive measures have been taken currently  to\r\n\r\nhelp our youths to deal with their time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwisely?   Given what has happened at the Boys' Home,  could  the\r\n\r\nMinister  also give us an update on plans by MCD to ensure  that\r\n\r\nproblems such as rioting do not recur?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the topic I would like to\r\n\r\ntalk about is Boys' Home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Boys' Home is a place for the juvenile offenders,\r\n\r\na  place for receiving punishment for their wrongdoing,  yet  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time  it is a place for them to continue  with  their\r\n\r\neducation and rehabilitation.  As a Member of the GPC for MCD, I\r\n\r\nhave had the opportunity to visit the Boys' Home in Clementi.  I\r\n\r\ndiscovered that some of the residents there are as young  as  13\r\n\r\nyears  old.  From their look, they do not seem \"evil\"  as  those\r\n\r\nportrayed  in  the western films showing juvenile  offences.   I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  with proper guidance, counselling and continuing  to\r\n\r\nattend  school upon completion of their short stay in the  Home,\r\n\r\nnormally  about two years, most of them could turn  over  a  new\r\n\r\nleaf, just as any youngster now in secondary school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from what I have observed, the Home is more than 100\r\n\r\nyears old.  There is a lack of facilities and it is overcrowded.\r\n\r\nOn  the one hand, we could consider the rundown condition of the\r\n\r\npremises  as one form of punishment for the residents.   On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the  poor  training facilities  could  affect  the\r\n\r\noutcomes  of  the rehabilitation programme.  Worse still,  there\r\n\r\nare neither proper school premises nor programmes for the normal\r\n\r\nschool curriculum, except the offering of BEST and WISE classes.\r\n\r\nIn  my  view,  it  is  not  satisfactory.   We  should  consider\r\n\r\nproviding  facilities  which are equivalent  to  a  school  with\r\n\r\nproper curriculum for the young residents in the Boys' Home  who\r\n\r\nare still schooling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the objectives of the Home is for the purpose of\r\n\r\nrehabilitation, the staff or counsellors' contact with residents\r\n\r\nis  very  important because they can, through their contact  and\r\n\r\ncommunication with the residents, impart or extend their  values\r\n\r\nto the residents and help convert them.  This is part and parcel\r\n\r\nof the counselling and rehabilitation programme.  From what I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow, the supervisor to resident ratio of the Home currently  is\r\n\r\n1:40 in the day time, and 1:80 at night.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this ratio, I do not think the Home could\r\n\r\ndischarge its task of counselling or conversion well.  The staff\r\n\r\nto resident ratio must be strengthened to enhance the quality of\r\n\r\ncounselling  in  converting the residents and  helping  them  to\r\n\r\nreturn  and  contribute to society just like any ordinary  young\r\n\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I really hope that the Government would look into the\r\n\r\nrunning of the Boys' Home seriously with the injection of  funds\r\n\r\nand manpower to provide a proper programme to help the young and\r\n\r\nperhaps innocent residents to return to society and start a  new\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got another cut. May I continue?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, the next topic I would\r\n\r\nlike to talk about is child care service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more married women joining the workforce, placing\r\n\r\nchildren in the child care centres has become a norm in a modern\r\n\r\nindustrialised society.  Despite many child care  centres  being\r\n\r\nbuilt  in the young constituencies like mine, there is always  a\r\n\r\nshortage of full-time child care places in meeting the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  residents.   Sir,  I was told that  all  these  child  care\r\n\r\ncentres  are  not  only running child care  services,  but  also\r\n\r\nconducting  other children's enrichment programme because  these\r\n\r\nenrichment programmes are more lucrative than running child care\r\n\r\nservices.   Certain centres could have put the number of  places\r\n\r\nfor  child  care to a bare minimum so as to meet the contractual\r\n\r\nrequirements of MCD.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong for the child care centre to make\r\n\r\nmore  money.   However,  in my view, they should  only  consider\r\n\r\nmaking  more  money by running enrichment programmes  after  the\r\n\r\nlocal  child care needs are fulfilled.  Some of the  child  care\r\n\r\ncentres  have  100 children on the waiting list,  and  yet  they\r\n\r\nrefuse to take in the children because of the enrichment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   I  believe  this  is going  against  the  original\r\n\r\nintention of MCD in setting up child care centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge MCD to look into this and see in what\r\n\r\nway  child care centres would place child care services as their\r\n\r\npriority  and  help to provide sufficient child care  places  in\r\n\r\nmeeting the needs of the working mothers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, I would like to propose\r\n\r\nthis cut on child care with specific emphasis on education.   It\r\n\r\nmay  appear odd that I am talking about education.  But this  is\r\n\r\nnot  surprising, considering that education for  pre-primary  is\r\n\r\nunder MCD, and not under the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to be able to persuade the Minister to have a\r\n\r\nnational child care and pre-primary system, that child care  and\r\n\r\npre-primary services should not be simply left to market forces.\r\n\r\nThe  Government should go beyond its existing role  of  being  a\r\n\r\nfacilitator  of  such  services as this  is  an  area  that  has\r\n\r\nimportant economic and social implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of child care services has been seen as a\r\n\r\nvital  part  of  the national effort to encourage higher  labour\r\n\r\nparticipation rate amongst women.  There is always  the  concern\r\n\r\nthat  our  children are being brought up by foreign maids.   The\r\n\r\nforeign  maid  levy reflects this concern as there  are  dangers\r\n\r\ncaused by over-reliance on foreigners who may bring up Singapore\r\n\r\nchildren  in the light of their own cultures.  There  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  frequently  expressed concerns on the importance  and  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  transmit the right values to our young,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmaintain and strengthen the social fabric of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I sympathise with the Government's anxiety to\r\n\r\navoid  being suck into what it perceives as a potential  welfare\r\n\r\ntrap,  I  nevertheless  feel that an arm's  length  approach  to\r\n\r\nchildren has created its own set of problems.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nclarify these:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It is difficult to find a good child care. There is a\r\n\r\nquote  from  the  NUS  Society publication  recently.   It  said\r\n\r\n\"finding a good child care is like buying 4-D\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The long waiting list is a common experience amongst\r\n\r\nchild care providers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Uneven quality of service amongst various child care.\r\n\r\nThis is  sometimes because of the over-reliance on self-help and\r\n\r\nother  social groups who operate child care centres.  Some child\r\n\r\ncare  centres  have been known to hire foreigners  with  degrees\r\n\r\nfrom  Sri  Lanka and China who are cheaper but do not understand\r\n\r\nSingapore's  culture.  But I am particularly very  disturbed  by\r\n\r\nthe worrying trends towards racial segmentation.  Muslim parents\r\n\r\ntend to enrol their children in mosque-run kindergartens and day\r\n\r\ncare  centres.   Higher  income families  tend  to  enrol  their\r\n\r\nchildren in child care centres that are run by Caucasians  whose\r\n\r\ncurriculum  and  teachers are vastly different  from  our  local\r\n\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am extremely concerned as the issue of segregation of\r\n\r\nchildren at such a young age cannot possibly be conducive to the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of a more cohesive society.  In fact, I would  caution\r\n\r\nthat  segregation  at  this level can  bring  about  strong  and\r\n\r\ndivisive forces in the future.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, urge the Minister to consider the\r\n\r\nintroduction of a national child care system as it is timely and\r\n\r\nappropriate.  The services can be provided by private  companies\r\n\r\nbut  the  coordination and regulation at various levels  can  be\r\n\r\ndone  by the Government.  Child care services should be seen  as\r\n\r\npart of the essential education of a child and be treated in the\r\n\r\nsame  way  as other forms of formal education.  Policy on  child\r\n\r\ncare  should  take  into  account both the  core  and  education\r\n\r\ncomponents.  The Government should be more directly involved  in\r\n\r\nsetting up these centres.  The formulation and implementation of\r\n\r\nchild  care  policies should be handled by both the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  and  Ministry  of  Education.   Attempts\r\n\r\nshould be made to resolve the space constraint problem.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  there  is clearly a strong competition  for  void  deck\r\n\r\nspaces  by  different social groups.  Space planning  for  child\r\n\r\ncare should be better coordinated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While diversity is not necessarily bad nor avoidable,\r\n\r\nattempts  should  be made to ensure that all  centres  not  only\r\n\r\nprovide  a  common minimum standard of service but also  a  core\r\n\r\ncurriculum  that  imparts our national values  to  our  children\r\n\r\nregardless  of  race, language, religion or  income  groups.   A\r\n\r\ncoordinated  national  child care system  will  also  be  better\r\n\r\npositioned  to  address some of the concerns I  raised  earlier,\r\n\r\nthat is, closer integration of different races, increased access\r\n\r\nto  all  families,  especially the lower income  families.   The\r\n\r\nlatter  is one effective way of giving Singaporeans as equal  as\r\n\r\npossible an opportunity to start their lives with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ensure that we maintain minimum standards to get\r\n\r\naround  the problem of uneven quality of services.  There should\r\n\r\nbe,  as  a  first  step,  closer  coordination  amongst  various\r\n\r\ninstitutions  that provide child care education,  including  the\r\n\r\nNational  Institute  of Education, NTUC and  the  PAP  Community\r\n\r\nFoundation and all other agencies that do it on an ad-hoc basis.\r\n\r\nLike  teachers in a formal education system, there should  be  a\r\n\r\nmore  rigorous  system to monitor the professionalism  of  child\r\n\r\ncare  givers.   Efforts  must be made  to  understand  the  poor\r\n\r\nresponse  to  training facilities offered by child care  givers.\r\n\r\nWhile the recruitment of new teachers is a challenge confronting\r\n\r\nall  levels of education, it seems to be particularly severe  at\r\n\r\nthe child care education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would conclude by saying that as the Republic moves\r\n\r\ntowards  the  next lap in its development, it should  bring  its\r\n\r\neducation  system  to  a level befitting  its  status.   A  more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  education system starting  with  the  early  pre-school years is one indication of such a progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, in last year's debate on\r\n\r\nthe  President's Address, Mr David Lim, Member for Aljunied GRC,\r\n\r\nmade  the point that investing in the very young will enable  us\r\n\r\nto  further  push the limit of our human resources.  This  point\r\n\r\nseems not to have been taken, regrettably, seriously enough  for\r\n\r\nthe  budget to be increased in relation to child care  generally\r\n\r\nin this year's budget.  The estimates for FY98 provide for $3.42\r\n\r\nmillion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  of  $42.8  million  development expenditure.   For  capital\r\n\r\ngrants,  they  amount  to  less than $1  million.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  this  is  a  very small  amount  of  the  total\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure budget.  Surely child care deserves more\r\n\r\nthan that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children must be at the heart of any family policy. The\r\n\r\noverriding  interest should be the welfare of our children.   We\r\n\r\nmust  be  more understanding of children's dependency needs  for\r\n\r\nstable  and  committed parenting or child  care  for  reasonable\r\n\r\nmaterial  provision, for educational and other opportunities  to\r\n\r\nenable  their  true potential to emerge.  In other words,  child\r\n\r\ncare  is not just about building child care centres or licensing\r\n\r\nprivate  operators  to  run  child care  centres.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nacknowledge  that there is an acute shortage of  facilities  and\r\n\r\ntrained-minders  for  the very young,  as  pointed  out  by  the\r\n\r\nNominated MP, Mr Zulkifli.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more positive approach has to be taken. A child policy\r\n\r\nrequires  coordination  among several agencies  and  Ministries.\r\n\r\nFirst,  may I ask what coordination now exists between  HDB  and\r\n\r\nMCD   in   terms  of  the  placement  of  child  care   centres,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  new  estates.  Timing  is  also  an  important\r\n\r\nelement.   I  am sure that many Members in the House would  have\r\n\r\nmet residents who requested letters of support in an attempt  to\r\n\r\nget  their  children  into  the very  few  child  care  centres,\r\n\r\nparticularly in new estates with a waiting list of more than 200\r\n\r\nsometimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, coordination between MCD and other Ministries, such\r\n\r\nas  Manpower,  to provide for skills training for  child-minders\r\n\r\nand  pre-primary teachers.  These skills upgrading  or  training\r\n\r\ncourses  should  also  attract  the  various  tax  rebates   and\r\n\r\nexemptions   enjoyed  by  other  workers.   Third,  coordination\r\n\r\nbetween MCD and grassroots organisations to improve feedback  on\r\n\r\nthe  need  for such facilities in different areas of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWithout  such coordination and feedback, MCD's response  appears\r\n\r\nto be sluggish and not proactive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the need for a more positive approach to child care\r\n\r\npolicy is great.  I hope the Minister can respond wholeheartedly\r\n\r\nto increasing not just the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilding  of child care centres but also the training  of  child\r\n\r\ncare  minders generally.  Child care at an early age will foster\r\n\r\ngood  habits and develop minds.  We can and should do  more  for\r\n\r\nour children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, as a nation, we have to wean\r\n\r\nourselves  from an over-dependence on foreign labour, especially\r\n\r\ndomestic  labour.  We also want our women to contribute  to  the\r\n\r\neconomic growth of our country by staying in the workforce.  Who\r\n\r\nwill  then look after our children?  Who will teach and  nurture\r\n\r\nthem?   I  am one with Mr Zulkifli in asking if we have  to  pay\r\n\r\nsomebody to teach them and nurture them, would it not be  better\r\n\r\nto  rely  on well-trained professionals who have our own  values\r\n\r\nand understand our own cultural sensitivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some things we can learn from the developed\r\n\r\ncountries in this area where they have large numbers of women in\r\n\r\nthe  workforce  and  yet only the very very  rich  have  live-in\r\n\r\ndomestic  help.   One of the ways they do this  is  to  have  an\r\n\r\nextensive  system of child care centres, nurseries and  creches.\r\n\r\nMany  enlightened  employers  even  run  these  centres  at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace.   The  advantage  of such arrangements  is  that  the\r\n\r\nmother brings the child to the same place she works, leaves  the\r\n\r\nchild  with professional child carers and goes to her own  work.\r\n\r\nAt  lunch  time, she can visit her child, play with  her  child,\r\n\r\nhave  personal quality time to interact and bond with the child.\r\n\r\nWhen  the child is ill, the mother can work with peace  of  mind\r\n\r\nbecause  she can pop in now and then to check on the  child  and\r\n\r\nthe  company benefits too from this arrangement because she does\r\n\r\nnot have to apply for urgent leave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, she does not have to rush off early\r\n\r\nfrom work to battle the traffic jams so that she can pick up her\r\n\r\nchild  in time.  Instead, she can just pop in to the centre  and\r\n\r\nmake  arrangements  with the staff there before  going  back  to\r\n\r\nwork.   Alternatively, she can pick up her child and  bring  the\r\n\r\nchild  back  to her work desk.  She can then quickly finish  her\r\n\r\nwork without being worried sick to death that her child will  be\r\n\r\ntraumatised by the delay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  that the child care centre will levy a huge penalty  on  her\r\n\r\nfor not picking up the child punctually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a simple idea and highly practical. Why do we\r\n\r\nnot  have  more  of such arrangements?  Perhaps we  should  give\r\n\r\nemployers  tax  incentives or grants to build and  operate  such\r\n\r\ncentres.   Or  as Prof. Chin has said, we could perhaps  release\r\n\r\nmore funds to upgrade the carers' skills and give them pride  of\r\n\r\nplace  so that people actually would want to work in such places\r\n\r\nand  it  would no longer be a lottery to find a good child  care\r\n\r\ncentre.  More importantly, I think the Government should set the\r\n\r\nexample  by  setting up centres like these in all the Government\r\n\r\ndepartments.   If  the  Government  employees  do  not  form   a\r\n\r\nsufficient  catchment for the service, they could  open  up  the\r\n\r\ncentres to workers working in the immediate vicinity or  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  building.  And who says they should limit this service  to\r\n\r\nmothers?  I know there are some fathers who would need this type\r\n\r\nof  service  too.   I do hope the Minister would  consider  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion useful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, I want to move away from child\r\n\r\ncare  to  the problem of child abuse.  On 14th October 1997,  an\r\n\r\nunwed father was sentenced to 10 years for causing the death  of\r\n\r\nhis  three-month old son.  In today's Straits Times,  a  mother,\r\n\r\nsentenced  for  child  abuse, had her sentence  doubled  by  the\r\n\r\ncourts.  She was described as a cruel animal who should not be a\r\n\r\nmother.   Winnie Ho's tragic case, perhaps more than  any  other\r\n\r\ncase recently, has galvanised public awareness of child abuse in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There is enough ground support for the Government to\r\n\r\nensure wider protection of innocent children and to take abusive\r\n\r\nparents to task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While child abuse cases provide dramatic and visual proof\r\n\r\nof the need to intervene, punish violent behaviour in the family\r\n\r\nsetting, they also raise many questions about the causes of such\r\n\r\ndisturbingly  violent behaviour.  Some recent  reports  seem  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that child abuse is precipitated by stress.  A report in\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday  Times of 15th March 1998, for example, quoted a  one  Mr\r\n\r\nChong Meng Fat who had been sentenced for inflicting harm to his\r\n\r\n8-year  old daughter as saying that his job as a security  guard\r\n\r\nwas too stressful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many families no doubt are emotional and economically ill-equipped to care for their children. Caring for a child on low\r\n\r\nincome  combined with the inherent stress of caring  for  highly\r\n\r\ndependent young child can be overwhelming.  Many harried parents\r\n\r\nfeel overwhelmed by the relentless onslaught of responsibilities\r\n\r\nwith  their jobs, children and themselves.  But child  abuse  is\r\n\r\nnot an inevitable outcome in stressful environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to look at both ends of the child abuse\r\n\r\nproblem.  I strongly support any Government move to ensure  that\r\n\r\nchild  abuses are appropriately punished.  But at the same time,\r\n\r\nwe  also need to look into ways of preventing child abuse.   The\r\n\r\neffects  of  child abuse are long lasting.  Child  abuse  leaves\r\n\r\nphysical and emotional scars that are likely to be carried  into\r\n\r\nadulthood.  Moreover, victims of child abuse are more likely  as\r\n\r\nadults  to  be  violent  towards their children.   We  jail  the\r\n\r\nabusers  today but they will eventually be released and continue\r\n\r\nto be parents.  How do we ensure that abuse does not recur?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good parenting is not an attribute that we can turn on and\r\n\r\noff   automatically.   As  parents,  we  too  need  support  and\r\n\r\nguidance.   Can  we take some proactive steps  to  help  parents\r\n\r\nbecome  better parents?  Can we not mobilise resources  to  help\r\n\r\nthe  community  agencies  put  in  place  counselling  and  care\r\n\r\nprogrammes for parents?  Can we not identify new parents at risk\r\n\r\nand  provide  them with support and information about  parenting\r\n\r\nand community resources?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister inform the House on any new\r\n\r\nprovisions to protect our children and, in particular, would  he\r\n\r\ntell  us  whether steps are being taken to help parents  develop\r\n\r\nhealthy and supportive family environment?  What are we doing to\r\n\r\nhelp  abusers move away from rage, neglect and violence in their\r\n\r\nparent-child relationship?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have got one to two minutes more.
