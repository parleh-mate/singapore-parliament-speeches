Operating a  hawker\r\n\r\nstall is a business that requires a financial investment  and\r\n\r\ngood  culinary skills.  Many \"hardship\" cases allotted stalls\r\n\r\nin  the  past were unable to operate their stalls  profitably\r\n\r\nand  their  businesses  failed,  leading  to  more  financial\r\n\r\nhardship.    Some   resorted  to  subletting   their   stalls\r\n\r\nillegally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hawker business is best left to people with adequate\r\n\r\nresources and culinary skills whilst \"hardship\" cases  should\r\n\r\nseek other forms of employment or assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun A.

The\r\n\r\npolicy  to  allocate stalls to hardship cases was started  in\r\n\r\n1975 and the policy was stopped in 1990. When the policy  was\r\n\r\nreviewed, it was felt that there was no longer a need for the\r\n\r\npolicy.   Maybe I can give an idea of the situation  at  that\r\n\r\ntime.  There were then a total of 648 approved hardship cases\r\n\r\non the waiting list.  In 1990, when the policy was stopped, a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  212  vacant cooked food stalls  and  1,621  market\r\n\r\nproduce stalls were offered to them.  However, there were  no\r\n\r\ntakers.  In fact, all 648 cases had not selected a  stall for\r\n\r\nnine  months and 538 had not selected any stalls for  over  a\r\n\r\nyear.  In fact, most of them were not really in dire need  of\r\n\r\na  stall.   Many of them could not operate the stalls.   They\r\n\r\nwere  hoping  to get stalls in good locations  so  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  sublet to other people and, indirectly, get a  subsidy\r\n\r\nfor living allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR THE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 2000 TO 31ST MARCH, 2001</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b></b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Paper Cmd.

Prof. Chin.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to raise three matters concerning road safety.   First,\r\n\r\ncan  the Ministry look into whether the entry and exit points\r\n\r\non   certain   highways,  such  as  the  CTE,   be   resited,\r\n\r\nparticularly one that involves a confluence of points  on  to\r\n\r\nthe  CTE.   For example, first, the confluence of two  exits,\r\n\r\none from the PIE and the other from Toa Payoh, as we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproach  the CTE.  Next, these two then converge on  to  the\r\n\r\nCTE  just  at the point when the CTE has an exit  point  into\r\n\r\nFarrer  Road.  This, I believe, is why every evening  we  see\r\n\r\nthe  sign, \"Heavy traffic up to Braddell\".  In the  same  way\r\n\r\nfrom  the other side of the CTE going towards the city, every\r\n\r\nmorning we have virtually the same problem so that we see the\r\n\r\nwarning, \"Heavy traffic from Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 or 1 to  the\r\n\r\nPIE\".   Arguably, these must be the most congested areas  and\r\n\r\nit  may  well  be due to the misplacement of exit  and  entry\r\n\r\npoints.   So I hope that the Ministry can do something  about\r\n\r\nalleviating the conditions by resiting exit and entry  points\r\n\r\non this particular stretch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, could LTA look into more road safety indicators\r\n\r\nto  prevent  two  bad habits?  The first is the  tendency  of\r\n\r\ndrivers and motorcyclists to cut into lanes or weave  in  and\r\n\r\nout  of  lanes,  especially  on the  expressways.   I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether installation of devices, such as cat's eyes, would be\r\n\r\none  way  of discouraging this irritating and often dangerous\r\n\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second bad habit is tailgating, particularly, on bus\r\n\r\nlanes.  Could the Ministry, for example, consider the use  of\r\n\r\nchevrons  on  the roads, particularly on the  fast  lanes  to\r\n\r\nindicate  safe distances that cars should have between  them.\r\n\r\nToo  often,  we  have  had multiple car pile-ups  because  of\r\n\r\ntailgating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, could LTA consider the banning of fog lights? I\r\n\r\nknow that, recently, LTA has responded in the Forum pages  to\r\n\r\nsay that such lights would be permitted.  But very often,  on\r\n\r\nclear  nights, there appears to be a lunatic freak who drives\r\n\r\na  certain mark of car, I think it is German, who delights in\r\n\r\nswitching on these lights that usually blind all others  even\r\n\r\nif  we  were  to view them from the rear view  mirror.   Such\r\n\r\ninconsiderate  people never seem to learn  the  lesson.   And\r\n\r\nsuch  lights  are supposed to be switched on when  there  are\r\n\r\nhazardous   conditions.   But  in  Singapore,  these   lights\r\n\r\nthemselves  actually form the real hazard.   So  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry will look into these matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  raised this issue in this House before and I would like\r\n\r\nto  hear  a commitment from the Minister that, at the  policy\r\n\r\nlevel,  his  Ministry will review transportation  safety  for\r\n\r\nschool  children from the ages of 3 to 12 who are  travelling\r\n\r\nto  and  from  school in buses.  The review will  consist  of\r\n\r\nworking out the costs of fitting school buses with bus  seats\r\n\r\nbefitting  the  size  and leg length of children  of  varying\r\n\r\nages,  beginning with those of a child as little as  3  years\r\n\r\nold.   The review will address the costs also of fitting  the\r\n\r\nback  seats  of  the car with padding so as  to  cushion  any\r\n\r\nconcussion that may result from a sudden brake by the driver.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  will  establish  and  continually  assess  the\r\n\r\ndriving  competence of bus drivers.  They would  ensure  that\r\n\r\neach  bus has a competent assistant who is able to discipline\r\n\r\nthe  children by making sure that they are seated and  belted\r\n\r\nand  who  is capable of crisis-management should an  accident\r\n\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister of State told me, during the last\r\n\r\nsitting,  that  there  were  no  fatal  accidents  linked  to\r\n\r\ntransportation   of   school   children   in   kindergartens.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there  was no need for seat  belts  or  to  refit\r\n\r\ncurrent  fleet of school buses.  I also learnt that the  same\r\n\r\nvans  or  buses which are ferrying school children  at  other\r\n\r\ntimes  are  used  by  older  students  and  adults  as  well,\r\n\r\ntherefore making it less cost effective for the bus  operator\r\n\r\nto  fit his buses only for use by a limited category of young\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for me, safety is an issue which cannot be\r\n\r\ncompromised   or   calculated   on   principles    of    cost\r\n\r\neffectiveness.   Unless we study the problem and  the  latest\r\n\r\ndevelopment  on car fittings, we cannot be so sure  that  the\r\n\r\ncost  is  unaffordable.  In any case, the principle  of  best\r\n\r\npractice   on   transportation  safety  must  be  safeguarded\r\n\r\nirrespective of costs and pragmatic reasoning.  A speed limit\r\n\r\ncannot  serve  as a safety substitute.  We all  know  that  a\r\n\r\nsudden  brake,  even when driving at the slowest  speed,  can\r\n\r\nsucceed  in throwing the child towards the window screen  and\r\n\r\ncracking his or her neck.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister not to delay in studying this issue\r\n\r\nseriously.   It is better to err on the side of caution.   We\r\n\r\nmay  not  have  had fatal accidents, but certainly,  we  must\r\n\r\nprotect our children from being maimed due to our failure  in\r\n\r\nnot  spending a few hundred dollars more in fitting  out  the\r\n\r\nbuses.   One  real concern is the unhappiness of  parents  if\r\n\r\nthey were to pay more for transportation because the costs of\r\n\r\nrefitting  the buses will mean passing the costs  on  to  the\r\n\r\nusers.   Surely, if any government is capable of  making  its\r\n\r\npeople  accept a good policy despite its price hikes,  it  is\r\n\r\nour  Government.   And  surely, the fear  of  unhappy  public\r\n\r\nreaction cannot be a good reason for not doing something that\r\n\r\nis right in the first place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the role of the Government be one of a protector\r\n\r\nin  the  interests  of  the school children,  or  that  of  a\r\n\r\ndefender  on  behalf  of  the  commercial  interests  of  bus\r\n\r\noperators?  The Government must balance this conflicting role\r\n\r\nin favour of the children.  For me, as a mother, the decision\r\n\r\nis clearly evident.  I will pay for my child's safety because\r\n\r\nhe  or she is priceless.  For those parents who cannot afford\r\n\r\nit,  the  school  and other supportive parents  can  help  to\r\n\r\nsubsidise  transportation  charges  for  their  children.   I\r\n\r\nrepeat, Sir, our children's safety cannot be compromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, Singapore has 3,120\r\n\r\nkilometres of roads and 700,000 vehicles on the roads.  As we\r\n\r\nprogress  to become a vibrant metropolis, we will expect  our\r\n\r\nroads  to be more busy, especially during the night.  We  are\r\n\r\nalso  a  fast  ageing population and there will be  a  higher\r\n\r\nproportion of drivers between the age of 50 and 60 years  old\r\n\r\nin the years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, we have many different types of road markings\r\n\r\nand  signages  on  our  roads.  The  road  signages  come  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  sizes,  fonts, colours  and  shapes.   These  road\r\n\r\nsignages  are usually placed at ad hoc locations and  can  be\r\n\r\nuntidy  and  sometimes confusing.  The recent change  of  the\r\n\r\ntourist  attractions'  road signages to  brown  is  indeed  a\r\n\r\ncorrect  step  towards standardising our  road  signages  and\r\n\r\nmaking them more user friendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are also many road markings on our roads.\r\n\r\nSome of these road markings are necessary and also confusing.\r\n\r\nThe  extensive road markings on our roads also  increase  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance  cost, and affect the smooth flow of  traffic  as\r\n\r\nthey need frequent maintenance and repainting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek the Minister's clarifications\r\n\r\non the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the policy for deciding where to place road\r\n\r\nsignages and road markings?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) How much is spent on road signages and markings\r\n\r\nmaintenance per year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the measures taken by the Ministry to\r\n\r\nensure  that  all  road  signages and markings  are  visible,\r\n\r\nespecially at night?\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, last year, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  adopted  the  bold  move  of  not  fining  the  ERP\r\n\r\nviolators  from  the  start, but by asking  them  to  pay  an\r\n\r\nadministrative  charge and the relevant ERP  fee.   This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  seen  as  a good move by the Ministry which  should  be\r\n\r\ncongratulated for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether this example should not serve as a\r\n\r\nmodel  for treating other types of offences that are,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak,  victimless.   I will give an example.  Last  year,  a\r\n\r\nmother  and  her six-year old child was caught  eating  while\r\n\r\nthey  were  leaving  an MRT station. They  had  already  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  the  electronic barrier and the mother thought  that\r\n\r\nthey  were  out of the restricted zone as it were.   However,\r\n\r\nthey  were  unpleasantly surprised when  they  were  accosted\r\n\r\nwhile   their  mouths  were  bulging  with  paus  and   given\r\n\r\nsummonses.  The officer did not listen to their  explanation,\r\n\r\nwhich was that the mother made a genuine mistake and it  took\r\n\r\ntwo  letters  of appeal before LTA decided to let  them  off.\r\n\r\nBut  once  again,  may I say that I am grateful  to  LTA  for\r\n\r\nletting them off.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this has led me to wonder whether we are doing\r\n\r\nthe right thing by banning, for example, eating and drinking,\r\n\r\nwhen what we are interested in is to punish littering.  It is\r\n\r\nnot  what  we  put inside our stomachs.  Surely that  is  the\r\n\r\nissue.   I  am  all for imposing fines for littering  because\r\n\r\nthat  is  definitely a matter of public hygiene.  But banning\r\n\r\neating   and   drinking,   perhaps,  needs   reconsideration.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, a public education programme would be better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation's\r\n\r\nregulations,  I  can  give  other examples  where  the  first\r\n\r\nresponse had been to summon the person and to give penalties.\r\n\r\nI  refer  especially,  for example,  to  non-compliance  with\r\n\r\ninstructions of an LTA officer, $500 fine; entering into  and\r\n\r\nremaining in train when it is full, $500 fine; feet placed on\r\n\r\nseats,  $500 fine; spitting and littering, $500 fine; playing\r\n\r\nmusical  instruments,  $500 fine; throwing  missiles,  $5,000\r\n\r\nfine.   I  know all these fines are compounded but these  are\r\n\r\nmatters that I thought could be dealt with first by having  a\r\n\r\npublic education programme, rather than by imposing penalties\r\n\r\nstraightaway on such undesirable modes of conduct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that LTA will consider reviewing their whole\r\n\r\nstructure  of  regulatory offences to see whether  the  first\r\n\r\nresponse  should  be  through the criminal  sanction.   Using\r\n\r\ncriminal  sanction  as first response for  certain  types  of\r\n\r\nconduct  can  be akin to using a machine gun  against  a  guy\r\n\r\narmed with a bow and arrow.  What I am saying is that a  good\r\n\r\npublic education programme should be tried out first and,  if\r\n\r\nit  does really become a problem, for example, if the  trains\r\n\r\nbecome  littered  with rubbish, then I  would  say  that  the\r\n\r\ncriminal sanction would be justified.  I hope that LTA  would\r\n\r\npursue more the line of public education rather than punitive\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, any visitor\r\n\r\nwho  travels on our roads will invariably get the  impression\r\n\r\nthat we have very new cars and generally green cars which  do\r\n\r\nnot pollute the air. That same\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvisitor  would  be forgiven if he, at the same  time,  thinks\r\n\r\nthat  as  far  as our buses, vans, taxis and motorcycles  go,\r\n\r\nhowever,  the  norm  is  that of  a  trail  of  black  smoke.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  the  authorities here give some  special  exemption\r\n\r\nfrom   anti-pollution   laws  to  commercial   vehicles   and\r\n\r\nmotorcycles.  That impression should be corrected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicles which spew pollutants reduce the quality of air\r\n\r\nthat  we  rely  on  to live.  It is an issue  which  we  must\r\n\r\naddress as a matter of survival.  Vehicles using fossil fuels\r\n\r\nalso drain our financial resources, as these fuels have to be\r\n\r\nimported at great cost from a cartel of nations which do  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily have our nation's interests at heart.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  must look at alternatives to the diesel or petrol  driven\r\n\r\nvehicles  for  the sake of our health, finances and  national\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cut our reliance on fossil fuels totally may not be\r\n\r\nfeasible,  but  we can reduce that reliance.  After  all,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  getting  plenteous  amounts  of  natural  gas  from\r\n\r\nIndonesia  soon.   Being  a tropical  country,  we  are  also\r\n\r\nblessed   with  lots  of  free  sunshine.  There   are   many\r\n\r\nalternatives  which  use these sources of  energy:   electric\r\n\r\ncars  which have become quite reliable with advances in,  for\r\n\r\nexample, battery technology; hybrid cars which allow electric\r\n\r\ncars  to  travel beyond the city; liquid petroleum gas  (LPG)\r\n\r\ncars which use natural gas, and even solar-powered cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is thus surprising to me that the Government is not\r\n\r\nputting in more effort to permit the use of such vehicles  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Could we not give tax incentives, for example, to\r\n\r\nthose  who  import such vehicles and the fuel that is  needed\r\n\r\nfor  such  vehicles, or rebates for those who use these  cars\r\n\r\nand   tax   reliefs  for  those  who  have   to   build   the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure,  such as the fuel stations,  to  service  and\r\n\r\nmaintain such vehicles?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the day when, because of such\r\n\r\nmeasures, we will have cleaner air, cheaper fuels and cheaper\r\n\r\ncars  and,  best of all, we can cock a snook  at  the  petrol\r\n\r\ncartels.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nseek  the  indulgence of the Minister for Communications  and\r\n\r\nInformation  Technology to consider the  future  of  post-war\r\n\r\nclassic  cars in Singapore.  We are referring to those  post-war cars that are more than 20 years old and quite apart from\r\n\r\nthose   pre-war  vintage  cars  that  already  enjoy  special\r\n\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to look into this matter now because\r\n\r\nmost  of  these cars have 10-year certificates of entitlement\r\n\r\n(COEs)  that will expire in May 2000. These cars are restored\r\n\r\nand  well-maintained  by  enthusiasts  and  they  are  to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered a heritage of ours worth preserving.  The problem,\r\n\r\nSir,  is  that  the costs and returns to continue  preserving\r\n\r\nthem are too foreboding under these current circumstances:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) the prevailing quota premium (PQP) is about $50,000\r\n\r\nand this is far too exorbitant in relation to the car values;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) a payment of the full PQP will not be commensurate\r\n\r\nwith the usual amount of usage of these cars; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) the payment of PQP has to be on a 10-yearly basis\r\n\r\nin order to qualify for future COE extensions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the owners are not able to afford the\r\n\r\nimpending  outlay for the COEs and they will have  to  either\r\n\r\nexport or scrap their cars. This will be most unfortunate and\r\n\r\nit  would, therefore, be good if the Minister alleviates  the\r\n\r\nsituation by endorsing a \"classic car category\" fairly  soon.\r\n\r\nThe  more  than 20-year post-war cars could then be  accorded\r\n\r\nsome  privileges  similar  to  those  for  the  \"vintage  car\r\n\r\ncategory\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority would have to collaborate\r\n\r\nwith  the relevant involved parties to formulate the criteria\r\n\r\nand  rules.   It  is necessary to be prudent  and  avoid  two\r\n\r\nsituations.  Firstly,  a \"bonanza\" situation  should  not  be\r\n\r\ncreated  in  these cars and especially in the \"new\"  20  year\r\n\r\nolds  when privileges are accorded. Secondly, an increase  in\r\n\r\nthe number of \"bad\" cars on our roads.  This may happen\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  poorly maintained \"new\" 20 year-old cars get registered\r\n\r\nin  the  \"classic  car category\" instead of  being  scrapped.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  having the cars qualify for categorisation initially\r\n\r\nand  imposing punitive transfer fees may ensure  only  valued\r\n\r\nand well-maintained cars remain in the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are encouraged to preserve and to appreciate our\r\n\r\nhistory  and heritage.  In line with this,  I would  like  to\r\n\r\npersuade  the Minister to enable us to continue  keeping  our\r\n\r\nclassic cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, Singapore is\r\n\r\nprobably the most expensive place in the world to buy and own\r\n\r\na  car. It all started many years ago when the car population\r\n\r\nexploded  and there was a need to dampen the demand for  cars\r\n\r\nto deal with congestions, which carries a high economic cost.\r\n\r\nWe  introduced the ARF, and then PARF, CBD, COE, RPS and ERP.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when COE for bigger cars fetched a price  of\r\n\r\n$100,000.  In spite of the high cost of owning a car,  demand\r\n\r\nfor  COEs remains in excess of the supply. This is partly due\r\n\r\nto  the aspiration to own a car and to a great extent, due to\r\n\r\nconvenience, bordering on necessity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been done and is being done to extend the\r\n\r\nnetwork of public transport. Undoubtedly, we already  have  a\r\n\r\npublic  transportation  system  that  we  can  be  proud  of.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  only  have to look at the  queues  of  vehicles\r\n\r\noutside   the   schools  to  see  but   one   important   and\r\n\r\nindispensable  use  of the car. Many mothers  have  made  the\r\n\r\nsacrifice to care for their young children and part of  their\r\n\r\ndaily routine includes the ferrying of their children to  and\r\n\r\nfrom  school  for classes, ECA activities, and  to  tuitions.\r\n\r\nFor  the  mothers, having a car is not a convenience,  but  a\r\n\r\nnecessity. The alternative would be that their children would\r\n\r\nhave  to wake up before 5 am and prepare for the school  bus,\r\n\r\nand what about the activities outside school hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have an effective means of dealing with\r\n\r\ncongestion. We have in place\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Electronic  Road Pricing system that is  unique  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.  Its  effectiveness  has  attracted  attention  and  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that there are interests shown by other countries  to\r\n\r\nimplement  a similar system.  As a result, the ARF  has  been\r\n\r\nreduced and the scale for road tax has been smoothened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broken down vehicle inevitably causes congestion.\r\n\r\nThere  is  belief  that older vehicles would  have  a  higher\r\n\r\ntendency  to break down.  Well, new cars do break  down  too.\r\n\r\nIn   any   case,  cars  being  retained  beyond  their   10th\r\n\r\nanniversary  are  subjected to a  revalidation  of  the  COE,\r\n\r\npremium  on the road tax, which amounts to 50% from the  15th\r\n\r\nyear  on, and an annual vehicle inspection. That is a lot  to\r\n\r\npay for any person.  Whilst it is easier to explain about the\r\n\r\nrevalidation of the COE, given that it has a validity  period\r\n\r\nof only 10 years, it is almost impossible to sound convincing\r\n\r\nabout  the  premium on road taxes since cars  older  than  10\r\n\r\nyears are subjected to an annual inspection.  Of course,  the\r\n\r\ninspection is to check on certain main safety aspects of  the\r\n\r\nvehicle   and  cannot  give  much  comfort  on  the   overall\r\n\r\nreliability of the vehicle.  Vehicles can break down  minutes\r\n\r\nafter passing a vehicle inspection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as motorists, we bear with the costs. However,\r\n\r\nexcept for the ERP, which is usage based, other policies  are\r\n\r\nnon-discriminating.  A person who uses the  car  occasionally\r\n\r\nfor  essential purposes only is equally penalised on cost  as\r\n\r\nthe person who uses the car indiscriminately, such as driving\r\n\r\nto  the provision store just five minutes away. With the COE,\r\n\r\nthe  growth  in  the  vehicle population is  controlled.   It\r\n\r\ncannot grow faster than the number of COEs being released.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ERP, vehicles are kept away from the main\r\n\r\narterial roads to keep them relatively congestion-free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that those who keep their cars in good\r\n\r\ncondition  are  rewarded. A badly maintained car  will  break\r\n\r\ndown  even if it is just a year old. Whilst whether a car  is\r\n\r\nin  good  condition  can  only be determined  by  a  thorough\r\n\r\ninspection, an effective alternative measure would be that if\r\n\r\nit is still\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrunning  well, in spite of being over 20 years old,  it  must\r\n\r\nhave been reasonably well-looked after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) introduce a more thorough annual inspection scheme\r\n\r\nfor  vehicles  older than 10 years and remove  the  road  tax\r\n\r\npremium on such cars; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) introduce a special scheme for cars older than 20\r\n\r\nyears  for restricted usage.  The main aim of such  a  scheme\r\n\r\nwould be to reduce the ownership cost of keeping a car beyond\r\n\r\n20  years.   Without proper maintenance, it is very  unlikely\r\n\r\nthat  a vehicle would be retained beyond 20 years. There  are\r\n\r\nmany  well-manufactured cars that, with proper care,  can  be\r\n\r\nused  on  the roads for many decades. This will avoid wastage\r\n\r\nwhere  serviceable  cars are scrapped and  worse,  if  it  is\r\n\r\nreplaced,  our foreign exchange reserve will be drawn  on  to\r\n\r\npay the foreign manufacturer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special scheme for older cars would benefit the\r\n\r\nretirees.  We are making the call for active ageing.   If  we\r\n\r\nwant  older  persons to remain in the workforce or  volunteer\r\n\r\ntheir  services,  we  should, at  the  very  least,  make  it\r\n\r\naffordable  for  them  to  retain  their  personal  mode   of\r\n\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average person would make a major upgrade when he or\r\n\r\nshe is around 45 years old.  20 years on, the person would be\r\n\r\n65  years  old  and approaching retirement or  retired.   The\r\n\r\nperson  will have less use of the vehicle but would  like  to\r\n\r\nkeep  it.   After  working  hard  and  contributing  to   the\r\n\r\nSingapore's economy all these years, it would not  be  asking\r\n\r\nmuch  to make it affordable for him to retain his vehicle  if\r\n\r\nhe  so wishes.  He will be subjected to the ERP, like anyone,\r\n\r\nand  would likewise have to use the vehicle discriminatingly.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, Singapore will have its own pool of heritage cars\r\n\r\nthat  would, in time, be viewed as vintage cars. We will have\r\n\r\non  our roads a living history of the evolution of cars  used\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your consideration, Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, most\r\n\r\npeople in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  basically understand that as a small  nation  with\r\n\r\nlimited  land  to  use,  we need to  have  a  set  of  highly\r\n\r\nefficient land transport system and a vehicle control system,\r\n\r\nto  make sure that our roads are free flowing.  The roads and\r\n\r\nrail networks are like the blood vessels in our body.  If the\r\n\r\nblood vessels are blocked, then the body will be partially or\r\n\r\ncompletely paralysed.  Singapore is the only country  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  that  has  successfully implemented the  COE  and  ERP\r\n\r\nsystems.  However, we cannot just depend on all these control\r\n\r\nmeasures,   because   clothing,   food,   accommodation   and\r\n\r\ntransportation are the four essential conditions in our life.\r\n\r\nWhen  everybody wants to own a car and there are  not  enough\r\n\r\nroads for the cars to move, we have to do something.  We have\r\n\r\nto build a very good network, a rail network or an integrated\r\n\r\npublic transport system.  These are very important to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rail network has progressed very rapidly in the last\r\n\r\nfew years.  The MRT system enables us to travel from east  to\r\n\r\nwest and from north to south.  The Airport line and the North-East  Line  will be completed in 2001 and 2002  respectively.\r\n\r\nAn  effective MRT system has also let us to make optimum  use\r\n\r\nof our land.  I would like to know whether the Government has\r\n\r\nany  plans  to  extend  the rail network  to  all  the  major\r\n\r\nresidential estates, so that they could be linked up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, the former Communications Minister, Mr Mah Bow\r\n\r\nTan,  and  the GPC Chairman, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, visited  many\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the world, and recommended the LRT  system  in\r\n\r\n1995.  The LRT will become an important mode of transport  in\r\n\r\nour HDB estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong announced the first LRT\r\n\r\nsystem  in  February 1996, and thereafter the Government  has\r\n\r\nalso  announced  LRT systems in Bukit Panjang,  Sengkang  and\r\n\r\nPunggol, and the people were very excited about this.   After\r\n\r\nthis,  the  residents in the other estates have been  waiting\r\n\r\nand  waiting, and yet they do not hear any news of LRT coming\r\n\r\nto their new towns.  I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe   are  going  to  extend  our  LRT  system  to  the  other\r\n\r\nresidential estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the rail network, our road network\r\n\r\nshould also be improved.  Last year, in the  Budget debate, I\r\n\r\nmentioned that ERP is a specific and effective cure, but  not\r\n\r\na panacea.  We must expand our road network and to clear some\r\n\r\nof  the  bottleneck situations in some of our roads.   It  is\r\n\r\nlike  a  patient  who  has an artery  blockage  problem.   If\r\n\r\nnecessary, we may have to get a specialist to put in a stent,\r\n\r\nso  that the blood vessels will be free again.  Otherwise, we\r\n\r\nmay even have to perform an operation on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our CTE is like a blood vessel which is almost\r\n\r\nincurable.   Recently, many private residential estates  were\r\n\r\ndeveloped  along  the  CTE.  In the north-east  area,  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  with the completion of Hougang  new  town  and\r\n\r\nwith  Sengkang and Punggol 21 rapidly developing, with  about\r\n\r\n1,000 units being completed every month, I hope we could have\r\n\r\na  new  blood  vessel there, so that these  areas  will   not\r\n\r\nsuffer a stroke and become paralysed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also do not wish to see the CTE having more and more\r\n\r\nERP  gantry points.  Otherwise, passing through the CTE  will\r\n\r\nbe a problem because we have to pay ERP all the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the North-East Line that is due to be completed in 2002-2003 will, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  bring  great  relief to the residents  of  Sengkang,\r\n\r\nPunggol  and  Cheng  San  GRC  in  general.   We  very   much\r\n\r\nappreciate  that  MCIT  has  helped to  speed  up  the  work.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  the  residents do  face  significant  traffic\r\n\r\nproblems because, as part of the MRT construction, there  are\r\n\r\nsignificant road diversions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few points that we would like to raise with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister.  Firstly, we would appreciate it  if  LTA  can\r\n\r\nlook  beyond just the local diversion, because some of  these\r\n\r\nlocal diversions prevent the opening of major arterial roads.\r\n\r\nThis means that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven though they do divert a small bypass but, for the estate\r\n\r\nas  a  whole, the roads are choked.  For example, in Sengkang\r\n\r\ntown, the main arterial road now is Punggol Road, which is an\r\n\r\nold   road   and,   unfortunately,  it  cannot   be   widened\r\n\r\nsignificantly.  So this causes significant problems and  time\r\n\r\nwastage  for the residents.  We are looking at whether  other\r\n\r\narterial  roads like Sengkang East Way or some  other  bypass\r\n\r\ncould be opened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is on transport problems on a larger\r\n\r\nscale, like what my colleague has just mentioned.  If we look\r\n\r\ncarefully  at  how the town is growing, we are  having  about\r\n\r\n1,000  new households moving in every month or so.   At  this\r\n\r\nrate  of  increase  in the population,  we  do  face  traffic\r\n\r\nproblems,  not  just locally, but also when  going  to  town,\r\n\r\ncongestion on CTE and other bypass roads.  The ERP has helped\r\n\r\nto some extent but, in the longer term, we should really look\r\n\r\nat   other   expressways  or  semi-expressways   to   provide\r\n\r\nalternatives for the residents there.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, with more and more\r\n\r\nnew  towns  being  developed, like Sengkang and  Punggol  21,\r\n\r\nnowadays  the  HDB  estates are getting  bigger  and  bigger.\r\n\r\nSengkang is bigger than Ang Mo Kio, and the density  is  very\r\n\r\nhigh.   There  are  more and more people in  each  new  town.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should have a very good public transport system\r\n\r\nfor the convenience of the residents there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know whether there is any coordination\r\n\r\nbetween  LTA  and HDB in this aspect, so that  the  residents\r\n\r\nwould  not  have to move into a new town where there  are  no\r\n\r\nbuses  running.  It would have been very inconvenient.  Also,\r\n\r\nthe  construction  of bus stops should  also  be  planned  in\r\n\r\nadvance, so that they could be completed before the residents\r\n\r\nmove in.  In this way, they would not have to suffer from the\r\n\r\nstrong sun and rain when they are waiting for buses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also have some direct buses from the city to\r\n\r\nthe  new  towns.  For example, Service No.  572 goes all  the\r\n\r\nway\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  Lorong  Chuan  to Shenton Way.   Such  an  express  bus\r\n\r\nservice  is very convenient for the residents, and  many  car\r\n\r\nowners may even turn to taking the bus instead of driving  to\r\n\r\ntown.  However, I feel that this type of bus service has  not\r\n\r\nreceived  much attention, because the numbers of these  buses\r\n\r\nare not found on the bus stops.  Once when I went to this bus\r\n\r\nstop,  I  was not sure which buses were passing that way  and\r\n\r\nwhether the bus routes were still operating.  I hope the  LTA\r\n\r\nwould encourage more operators to provide such direct express\r\n\r\nservice  so  that the residents in the new towns would  enjoy\r\n\r\nthis benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, in tropical Singapore, travelling\r\n\r\ncan  be  quite uncomfortable for bus commuters and motorists,\r\n\r\nespecially during the rainy days.  Whenever there is a  heavy\r\n\r\ndownpour in Singapore, we will notice that some bus commuters\r\n\r\nwill  be standing on the seat at bus stops for shelter, while\r\n\r\nmany motorists will seek shelter under flyovers, resulting in\r\n\r\nbottlenecks and traffic congestion.  These motorists are also\r\n\r\nendangering themselves by staying at the road shoulder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve a seamless land transportation system, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary to integrate the development and upgrading  of  bus\r\n\r\nshelters  into  the  development  guide  plans.   More  micro\r\n\r\nplanning  efforts should be focused to ensure that bus  stops\r\n\r\nare   correctly  positioned  for  the  convenience   of   bus\r\n\r\ncommuters.   The authorities must coordinate more closely  to\r\n\r\nensure   that   bus  shelters  are  provided   expeditiously,\r\n\r\nespecially  in new housing estates.  We also need  to  review\r\n\r\nthe design guidelines of bus shelters and rain shelters.   In\r\n\r\nmany    developed   countries,  bus  shelters   are   simple,\r\n\r\naesthetically pleasing, functional and maintenance free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to seek the following clarifications\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the policy for providing new bus shelters in new\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;housing estates?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the progress of upgrading existing bus shelters?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will the Ministry expedite the construction of rain\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shelters for motorists\r\n\r\nalong expressways?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, sweeping the road is\r\n\r\nnot  a  very desirable job.  With labour shortage and  rising\r\n\r\nlabour  cost,  it makes sense to use mechanical  sweepers  to\r\n\r\nclean  our  pavements.  We have seen some of  these  sweepers\r\n\r\nbeing  used today in a limited way.  But it is quite  comical\r\n\r\nwhen  they  try  to  navigate around trees, lamp-posts,  high\r\n\r\ncurbs  and  other obstacles, which are in their  way  on  the\r\n\r\npavements.  Would the Minister consider setting some standard\r\n\r\nand  uniformity in the design and building of our  pavements,\r\n\r\nin such a way as to facilitate the more extensive use of such\r\n\r\nmechanical sweepers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next topic relates to covered linkways. Our\r\n\r\nTown Councils and LTA have, over the years, built hundreds of\r\n\r\nkilometres of these linkways.  They do not come cheap, and  I\r\n\r\nhave  been  told  that  this  is because,  at  times,   major\r\n\r\nunderground  services need to be diverted.   Apart  from  the\r\n\r\nhigh  cost,  sometimes the diversion of these major  services\r\n\r\nhave  resulted  in  delays  and  caused  irritation  to   the\r\n\r\nresidents  around there.  A hole has been dug to prepare  for\r\n\r\nthe  foundation  and if the work does not  progress,  it  may\r\n\r\nbreed mosquitoes and our residents have complained from  time\r\n\r\nto  time.  To me, a linkway is quite a simple structure,  and\r\n\r\ncan  be  constructed with lightweight materials.  Perhaps  no\r\n\r\none has really sat down to work out a structure that could be\r\n\r\nused without the need of a deep foundation.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister whether an agency can be tasked with  this\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of designing a structure  that  can  be  used\r\n\r\nuniformly across Singapore without the need of designers  and\r\n\r\ncontractors  looking  at  it  on a  case-by-case  basis,  and\r\n\r\ndesigning  it  for  that purpose, but to  use  a  lightweight\r\n\r\nstructure  that  does  not  require  a  deep  foundation  and\r\n\r\ntherefore to reduce the cost of these linkways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third question is a simple one for the Ministry.\r\n\r\nHow  does  a  mother with two young children, aged  5  and  2\r\n\r\nyears,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none of whom is in a stroller and the other has to be held  by\r\n\r\nthe  hand, cross Alexandra Road safely from the Ikea side  to\r\n\r\nthe Anchorage Condominium on the other side of the road?   By\r\n\r\nthis,  I  am  referring to the tragic accident that  happened\r\n\r\njust before the Lunar New Year, where a Korean mother and her\r\n\r\ntwo  young  children were knocked down.  Most of us  had,  at\r\n\r\nsome  point  of  time, young children, and  all  of  us  have\r\n\r\nexperienced  how difficult it is to use overhead  bridges  or\r\n\r\nunderpasses  because  of  the  steps,  when  we   also   have\r\n\r\ngroceries,  shopping bags and a stroller  The  difficulty  is\r\n\r\ncompounded  many  times, to the point where pedestrians  find\r\n\r\nthat they have no choice but to risk dashing across the road.\r\n\r\nWhy  can  we  not  install escalators?  Even  the  very  busy\r\n\r\nunderpasses  under Orchard Road and Scotts Road do  not  have\r\n\r\nescalators throughout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I visited some cities in Germany in 1980 when I was\r\n\r\nstudying  in  England.  I was very impressed  that  they  had\r\n\r\nescalators  leading  to their subway systems.   They  do  not\r\n\r\noperate  all  the time, but are equipped with  pressure  mats\r\n\r\nlike  those  that  we  have to open automatic  sliding  doors\r\n\r\nbefore  motion detectors became popular.  Sir, when you  step\r\n\r\non  the  mat, the system is activated and it moves.  After  a\r\n\r\nwhile,  the escalator stops to conserve energy.  That was  20\r\n\r\nyears  ago. Do we have a lower standard of living today  than\r\n\r\nthat enjoyed by the Germans 20 years ago?\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a fast aging population. Our overhead\r\n\r\nbridges and underpasses have to be more elderly friendly  and\r\n\r\nless cumbersome for people who are less than fully mobile.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, first I would like to\r\n\r\nthank all the Members who have spoken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Dr Michael Lim, Mr Goh Choon Kang and\r\n\r\nMr Yeo Guat Kwang\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  also  spoken on the ERP and the road system.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  take  them  altogether since they  are  all  inter-related.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin first by highlighting some of the key\r\n\r\nchallenges  we  face  in  the  future  with  regard  to  land\r\n\r\ntransport because that is very relevant to the solutions that\r\n\r\nwe  are  having today and in the future.  Today, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmake only about seven million trips a day and already, as  we\r\n\r\nall  know, some roads are very congested and during the  peak\r\n\r\nhours  the buses are all packed.  We project that the  number\r\n\r\nof  daily trips will increase to 10 million by the year 2010,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  a 40% increase from today over the next 10  years.\r\n\r\nBy  the year 2030, the number of daily trips will increase to\r\n\r\n14  million.   That is a doubling over today's number.   Such\r\n\r\nsignificant  increases  would not be  a  problem  if  we  had\r\n\r\nplentiful land but, unfortunately, we do not.  About  12%  of\r\n\r\nour  limited  land  is  already used by  the  land  transport\r\n\r\ninfrastructure network.  By comparison, 13% of our total land\r\n\r\nis  used  for housing.  This shows that there is very limited\r\n\r\nscope  to significantly expand our road network to cater  for\r\n\r\nmore  vehicular  trips and therefore the cornerstone  of  our\r\n\r\nland  transport policy is, and will always be,  an  excellent\r\n\r\nmass   public  land  transport  system  that  is  affordable,\r\n\r\nefficient,  comprehensive in coverage and  which  can  be  an\r\n\r\nattractive alternative to private transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, not all trips can be made on the rapid transit\r\n\r\nsystem  or  in  buses.  Goods being transported  have  to  be\r\n\r\ntransported  in  vehicles and these  vehicles  use  the  road\r\n\r\nsystem.   Buses also use the roads and will continue to  have\r\n\r\nan  important role  in serving areas not covered by our rapid\r\n\r\ntransit  system.  Our vehicular population will also continue\r\n\r\nto  grow as we cater to the growing demands for business  and\r\n\r\nfor  the  aspirations of our people to own cars.  But because\r\n\r\nof land, and therefore, road constraints, we cannot allow our\r\n\r\nvehicle population to grow unfettered.  Nor can we allow  our\r\n\r\nroads to be congested that all economic and social activities\r\n\r\ncome to a halt.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the Vehicle Quota System to control the growth of\r\n\r\nthe  vehicle  population and the ERP system to  control  road\r\n\r\ncongestion.   These are vital components of the  Government's\r\n\r\noverall  land  transport  policy.   They  will  enable   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  own cars whilst ensuring  that  our  roads,\r\n\r\nwhich are like our nation's economic arteries, as pointed out\r\n\r\nby Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, are kept flowing efficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim was concerned about the ERP Phase 2B and\r\n\r\nthe further expansion of the ERP system. The objective of the\r\n\r\nERP  Phase  2 is to address the increasing traffic congestion\r\n\r\nalong the arterial roads leading into the existing Restricted\r\n\r\nZone (RZ). Hence,  Phase 2 of the ERP established this second\r\n\r\ncordon  along the outer ring roads. As not all the  roads  in\r\n\r\nthe second cordon are presently congested, LTA will implement\r\n\r\nPhase  2  in  stages.   The  first  stage  of  Phase  2   was\r\n\r\nimplemented  last year in September 1999, and seven  gantries\r\n\r\nwere implemented at the most congested locations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 2B, which is on the way, will have 11 to 12\r\n\r\ngantries, and this will complete the second cordon.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to assure Dr Lim that we will be very careful and  will\r\n\r\nonly introduce these gantries when the traffic conditions  at\r\n\r\neach  of  these locations become unacceptable.  As Dr Michael\r\n\r\nLim  has  also  pointed out, whenever we have an  ERP  priced\r\n\r\nroad, it tends to divert traffic to other parts that are  not\r\n\r\nERP-priced.   This  is, of course, to be expected.   I  think\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are very aware of the need to control cost.   So\r\n\r\nthose  who find that the ERP rate may be too high, they  will\r\n\r\nseek  other alternative roads.  In fact, this is one  of  the\r\n\r\ndesired  outcomes of the ERP system.   When one road  is  too\r\n\r\ncongested  we price it.  Those who find that the  pricing  is\r\n\r\ntoo high would then find alternative roads, or they can shift\r\n\r\ntheir travel times because there is some flexibility there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the ERP system which uses the user-pay principle\r\n\r\nhas  been  very effective in influencing motorists' behaviour\r\n\r\nand has kept the traffic flow on our roads quite\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanageable in the day time.  However, certain expressways are\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  show signs of strain during the  peak  evening\r\n\r\nhours.   If  necessary, ERP may be extended  to  the  evening\r\n\r\nhours  on  these heavily congested roads to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ntraffic does not come to a standstill.  LTA is monitoring the\r\n\r\ntraffic  speeds on the congested expressways in the  evenings\r\n\r\nand  will recommend whether we need to introduce evening  ERP\r\n\r\nin due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Chay and Dr Michael Lim also asked about\r\n\r\nalternatives  to ERP.  Other than just simply increasing  the\r\n\r\nrate  for  ERP, what are the alternatives?  Sir,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned just now, motorists do have alternatives.  They can\r\n\r\nchange  their  pattern of travel, their time  of  travel  or,\r\n\r\nbetter still, they can switch to public transport.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nwe  certainly hope that more motorists will switch to  public\r\n\r\ntransport over time.   LTA will continue to work closely with\r\n\r\nthe  Public Transport Council, SMRT and the bus companies  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  public  transport  system  is  keeping  up\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily with the demand.  We will also be speeding  up\r\n\r\nconstruction of  two new expressways and expanding the  rapid\r\n\r\ntransit system.  I will go into this later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang brought up a few points yesterday. He\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  request  that he  made  last  month  about\r\n\r\nreducing ERP rates for school holidays or certain periods  of\r\n\r\nthe  year where travel is less.  As I had informed him in  my\r\n\r\nreply,   LTA  will look into his suggestion.  I am  happy  to\r\n\r\ninform  the House that LTA has studied the situation and  has\r\n\r\nagreed  that it is possible for the ERP rates to  be  revised\r\n\r\nduring  parts of the year as the travel pattern is definitely\r\n\r\nlighter.  This coincides with the school holiday pattern.  As\r\n\r\nwe all know, many families go away during the school holidays\r\n\r\nand  therefore  the roads become noticeably lighter.   So  we\r\n\r\nwill begin the first trial in June this year to coincide with\r\n\r\nthe  June  holidays.   The  new rates  will  be  designed  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  acceptable speeds on the roads.  We may adjust  the\r\n\r\nrates  from  time to time, as we do with all  the  other  ERP\r\n\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang also suggested that we review the ERP\r\n\r\ncharges  for  the  restricted zones because  during  off-peak\r\n\r\nhours he mentioned that certain roads in the restricted  zone\r\n\r\ntend  to be very lightly used.  Sir, the speeds measured  for\r\n\r\nthe  restricted  zone are based on a basket  of  routes  that\r\n\r\ncover  both  the busy areas as well as areas which  are  less\r\n\r\nbusy   or   less   utilised  and  they  are  chosen   to   be\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the average traffic conditions  within  the\r\n\r\nrestricted  zone.   It  is not possible  to  just  isolate  a\r\n\r\nparticular  road  that  is lightly used  because  within  the\r\n\r\nrestricted  zone, all the roads are inter-related and  inter-connected.   For example, a certain stretch of  Orchard  Road\r\n\r\nmay  be  very lightly used but, nonetheless, the  traffic  on\r\n\r\nthat  stretch  can still end up in Bras Basah Road  or  other\r\n\r\nparts of the city and contribute to congestion. So we have to\r\n\r\ntake  the whole restricted zone as one.  Nonetheless, I  will\r\n\r\nask   LTA  to  monitor  the  situation  closely  within   the\r\n\r\nrestricted zone and see whether it is feasible to reduce  the\r\n\r\nERP rates during the off-peak hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay yesterday also asked about the ERP and how does\r\n\r\nthe  ERP  collection  compare with  the  old  Area  Licensing\r\n\r\nScheme.   Sir,  the  ERP  has  resulted  in  a  25%  drop  in\r\n\r\ncollections versus the previous ALS system.  This  is  before\r\n\r\neven accounting for the rebates in road taxes.  The drop is a\r\n\r\nvery real one.  It is quite substantial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asked about the COE quota for this year and\r\n\r\nwhether  LTA  is  going  to introduce the  recommendation  to\r\n\r\nmoderate  the peak in the COE supply  by his Committee  which\r\n\r\nwas  made last year.  Members will be happy to note that  the\r\n\r\nCOE  supply  will again provide for 3% growth in our  vehicle\r\n\r\npopulation for the Quota Year May 2000 to April 2001.   Based\r\n\r\non  LTA's  computations, the COE quota  for Quota  Year  2000\r\n\r\nwill  be 109,452.  This is about 61% more than that of  Quota\r\n\r\nYear  1999,  and  will be about 50% more  than  that  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  projection for Quota Year 2001.   Although  the  GPC\r\n\r\nchaired  by  Mr  Chay  in its review of  the  VQS  last  year\r\n\r\nrecommended that we moderate this peak\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  supply,  my Ministry has decided not to do  so.   Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain why.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because we have implemented the GPC's\r\n\r\nrecommendation that we use projected deregistrations  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  year  rather than the actual deregistration  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious year in computing the new COE supply.  This has  led\r\n\r\nto  a  better  match  between supply  and  demand.    As  the\r\n\r\nprojected  number of deregistrations will be high this  year,\r\n\r\nthere  is a need to raise the quota correspondingly to  match\r\n\r\nthe   peak  demand  pattern.   If  the  Government  were   to\r\n\r\narbitrarily  moderate the quota, we run  the  risk  that  the\r\n\r\nmoderated  quota  may  be too low to  meet  the  demand  from\r\n\r\nderegistrations. As a result, this would cause the COE prices\r\n\r\nto spiral upwards.  If the actual deregistration figure turns\r\n\r\nout  to be higher or lower than what was projected, then next\r\n\r\nyear's  quota supply will be adjusted accordingly.  LTA  will\r\n\r\nbe releasing the full details of the annual quota today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay had also asked whether the COE prices for cars\r\n\r\nhave  stabilised after the merger of the car  COE  categories\r\n\r\nfrom  four to two categories.  During the review of  the  VQS\r\n\r\nlast  year,  the Committee had noted that the  monthly  quota\r\n\r\nsize  for  Category  1, which are cars  below  1,000  cc  and\r\n\r\nCategory  4,  which are cars above 2,000 cc,  was  relatively\r\n\r\nsmall.  It felt that such small quota size was undesirable as\r\n\r\nit was likely to lead to greater fluctuations in COE prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the amalgamation of the four categories into two,\r\n\r\nthe COE prices in Categories A and B have seen some degree of\r\n\r\nstability,  as  anticipated  by the  Review  Committee.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, let me give Members some figures.  During the  past\r\n\r\nsix  months, the month-to-month fluctuation in the COE prices\r\n\r\nin  Category  A ranged from 1% to 13%.  Prior to the  merger,\r\n\r\nthere  were wide fluctuations in Category 1 COE prices.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  between October and November 1996, the  fluctuation\r\n\r\nwas  67% and between February and March 1996, the fluctuation\r\n\r\nwas  80%.   Between  April and May 1995,  the  month-to-month\r\n\r\nfluctuation was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1745</b></font><br><br>\r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n134%.   Indeed,  the recommendation of the  Committee  was  a\r\n\r\ncorrect one.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about Category B? Category B COE prices have also\r\n\r\nstabilised with fluctuations between 1% and 11%.  Previously,\r\n\r\nthe  fluctuations in Category 4 COE prices went up to as high\r\n\r\nas 42%.  So that was a good recommendation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Dr Michael Lim talked about the\r\n\r\nCTE  and  the  traffic  access  to  the  North-east  part  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  also asked what plans we have  for  expanding\r\n\r\nboth the expressways and rail network.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to relieve the CTE congestion, I am happy to inform\r\n\r\nthe House that LTA is developing two new expressways, ie, the\r\n\r\nKallang  Expressway (KLE) and its northward extension,  which\r\n\r\nis  the  Paya Lebar Expressway (PLE).  The KLE and  PLE  will\r\n\r\nprovide  an alternative road for people living in the  North-east,  such as in Sengkang and Punggol.  I have asked LTA  to\r\n\r\nlook   into   speeding  up  the  development  of  these   two\r\n\r\nexpressways.   As  a result, I think Members  would  be  very\r\n\r\nhappy  to  know that LTA would be commencing construction  of\r\n\r\nboth  Expressways early next year, and will complete the  KLE\r\n\r\nin 2005 and the PLE in 2006.  LTA will also work closely with\r\n\r\nthe bus companies to further improve the bus services serving\r\n\r\nthe  North-east area, so that those motorists who  decide  to\r\n\r\nswitch   to   public  transport  would  have  an   attractive\r\n\r\nalternative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, we will continue to expand the\r\n\r\nroad  capacity, but there is a limit to this, given our  land\r\n\r\nconstraints.  Our growing transport needs must be met through\r\n\r\na comprehensive and efficient public transport system, one of\r\n\r\nwhich  is  our  rapid  transit system.  This  will  form  the\r\n\r\nbackbone of our public transport system in the years to come.\r\n\r\nThe Government will be developing a comprehensive RTS network\r\n\r\nmatching  the coverage and convenience of systems in  London,\r\n\r\nTokyo and Paris.  The venture system will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomprise  a  close grid-like network of rapid transit  lines.\r\n\r\nFrom  the  city we will have rail lines spanning outwards  to\r\n\r\nthe  population centres, and there will be an orbital or ring\r\n\r\nline  linking  all  the  rail lines, and  this  will  form  a\r\n\r\ncomplete distributed network.  We will have local LRT network\r\n\r\nto  provide  links to the MRT network within  HDB  towns  and\r\n\r\nbetween HDB towns.  So this is in reply to Mr Yeo.  Yes, this\r\n\r\nwill  be  done,  but  of course all this will  take  time  to\r\n\r\ndeliver.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the Government expects to triple the rapid\r\n\r\ntransit  system  network from today's 91  kilometres  to  270\r\n\r\nkilometres by the year 2010.  So in 10 years' time,  you  can\r\n\r\nexpect tripling, and to again double it to 540 kilometres  by\r\n\r\nthe year 2030.   Currently, LTA is already working on several\r\n\r\nnew  lines.   They are the North-east line, the Changi  line,\r\n\r\nthe Sengkang and the Punggol LRTs, and we are retrofitting  a\r\n\r\nnew station on the existing East-west line near the Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic.   And  soon, work will also  begin  on  the  new\r\n\r\nMarina line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that we have put in place\r\n\r\ntough  but very necessary vehicle demand management measures.\r\n\r\nThe  ERP  and the VQS are key components of the overall  land\r\n\r\ntransport policy framework.  The public transport system  is,\r\n\r\nin  fact, the cornerstone of our land transport system.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  will continue to invest heavily in expanding  our\r\n\r\nrapid  transit system, and we will continue to work with  the\r\n\r\nbus  companies  to  ensure that there  is  an  efficient  and\r\n\r\nattractive  bus  alternative, and  all  these  together  will\r\n\r\nenable  us  to keep our car population growing while  keeping\r\n\r\nour expressways and arterial roads congestion-free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran yesterday called for more consultation by LTA\r\n\r\nwhen  planning new roads and expressways.  Sir, I agree  with\r\n\r\nhim  that it would be ideal if the road planners can  consult\r\n\r\neverybody,   from   the  conceptualisation   stage   to   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  stage.   But  there are  constraints.   Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads are planned and built to support economic and\r\n\r\nsocial activities and to cater\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  traffic growth.  In land scarce Singapore, road  projects\r\n\r\nwill  inevitably  affect existing land usage  and  buildings.\r\n\r\nThus, when planning and designing a road, the designers  will\r\n\r\ncarefully examine various alternatives and alignment options.\r\n\r\nTheir main aim is to minimise the land take in the most cost-effective  manner.   This  is done  very  professionally  and\r\n\r\nobjectively, since the designers have no vested interests  at\r\n\r\nall in the properties along the route.  Furthermore, the road\r\n\r\nproposals will be closely scrutinised and are deliberated  at\r\n\r\nlength  by  the  Master Plan Committee  before  they  can  be\r\n\r\nimplemented.   The  Committee members comprise  a  number  of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from Government departments  and  they  will\r\n\r\nevaluate  the  proposals based on factors,  such  as  traffic\r\n\r\njustification, economic value, land and environmental impact.\r\n\r\nAlternative  road  schemes  are  also  examined   for   their\r\n\r\nfeasibility.  So it is not just one proposal.  There have  to\r\n\r\nbe various alternatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognise that the information on which plot of\r\n\r\nland  or  which building is going to be affected  by  a  road\r\n\r\nscheme is very, very price-sensitive.  Thus, such information\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  divulged when the detailed design  is  still\r\n\r\nunder  study and very much likely to be subjected to  change.\r\n\r\nIf property owners along the proposed route are consulted,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  first,  we  can  expect the prices  in  the  area  to\r\n\r\nfluctuate   very  significantly,  and  we  can  also   expect\r\n\r\nobjections  from those affected.  I think it is very  natural\r\n\r\nfor  residents in the area affected to want to  have  a  road\r\n\r\nnearby  but  not  to  have  it  affect  them  directly.   The\r\n\r\nconsultation process will likely result in protracted  delays\r\n\r\nto  the  project and maybe even result in the  project  being\r\n\r\nabandoned, as we have seen in many countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, before LTA proceeds to implement a road\r\n\r\nproject,   it  will  brief  the  adviser  of  the  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisation   and  even  the  grassroots  leaders   of   the\r\n\r\nconstituencies  affected, of the implementation  details  and\r\n\r\nthe schedule of works, so as to prepare them for the oncoming\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLTA  will  also  try to assure them of the  various  measures\r\n\r\nwhich  are  being  taken  to  minimise  inconvenience.    The\r\n\r\nconsultation  will have an added benefit in  the  sense  that\r\n\r\nthis  will  allow the adviser and the grassroots  leaders  to\r\n\r\nalso  offer suggestions on how to minimise the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nSo this is a very important process which we will continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim expressed some concerns about the impact\r\n\r\nof the MRT construction on the road system in Sengkang.  Sir,\r\n\r\nlet  me,  first,  assure him that LTA and HDB  do  work  very\r\n\r\nclosely  together in planning the road network  for  the  new\r\n\r\ntowns.   The situation in Sengkang is, I think, quite a  fair\r\n\r\nbit  complicated by the fact that just as we are building the\r\n\r\nnew  town and the new roads, we are also having a very  major\r\n\r\nMRT  line going through it all underground.  And we know that\r\n\r\nunderground construction does pose a lot of complications  to\r\n\r\nthe road system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Sengkang, it was decided in 1996 that LTA\r\n\r\nwill  construct some of the internal roads which are affected\r\n\r\nby the construction of the North-east line.  This is to allow\r\n\r\nbetter coordination between the construction of the line  and\r\n\r\nthe  construction  of the roads.  The roads affected  include\r\n\r\nSengkang  East Way, Sengkang Central and Sengkang East  Road,\r\n\r\nand I understand these are major roads feeding into Sengkang.\r\n\r\nThe  roll-out plan for the road infrastructure was worked out\r\n\r\njointly  between  LTA and HDB, taking into consideration  the\r\n\r\npace  of development in these two towns.  Therefore,  LTA  is\r\n\r\naware that a thousand units are being opened each month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sengkang East Way has since been completed by LTA at the\r\n\r\nend  of January this year, and LTA has opened one of the  two\r\n\r\nlanes in each direction.  I will ask LTA to expedite its work\r\n\r\nand  open the remaining lane, both ways, as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nSengkang  Central and Sengkang East Road were  scheduled  for\r\n\r\ncompletion  only  end  of  next year,  and  this  is  because\r\n\r\nSengkang  Central is a two-way road, sitting  directly  above\r\n\r\nthe North-east line tunnel and the Buangkok station.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nObviously, the road cannot be completed until the station has\r\n\r\nbeen completed.  On the other hand, the Sengkang East Road is\r\n\r\naffected by the construction of the North-east line depot.  I\r\n\r\nwill  ask LTA to try to expedite the work there at the North-east  line depot and see whether we can schedule to move  the\r\n\r\ncompletion date for the Sengkang East Road by maybe April  or\r\n\r\nmid of next year, instead of December next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Punggol Road, this road, as mentioned by\r\n\r\nDr  Lim, was expanded by HDB to a two-lane dual carriage  way\r\n\r\nroad.  However, because of the intensive development work  on\r\n\r\nboth  sides of the road, I think this road tends to  be  very\r\n\r\ncongested.  Not only that, I understand that there is  a  lot\r\n\r\nof illegal parking along the road as well, and this has added\r\n\r\nto  the  congestion.  So I will get the LTA to work with  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  authorities  to see what we can  do  about  illegal\r\n\r\nparking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will ask my Minister of State and Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to answer the other questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):</b> Sir, first, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank  Assoc. Prof. Toh for  his  kind  remarks  on\r\n\r\nmeasures taken by LTA to improve road safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Road safety is a key consideration of LTA. And to that\r\n\r\neffect, LTA has set up a special unit called the Road  Safety\r\n\r\nEngineering  Unit  which focuses on road safety  engineering.\r\n\r\nIt will continually review and identify areas for improvement\r\n\r\nand help to enhance road safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has also engaged a consultant to carry out road\r\n\r\nsafety  review for all the expressways.  The review has  been\r\n\r\ncompleted  for  PIE, BKE, CTE and KJE, and it  has  concluded\r\n\r\nthat  these  expressways have met our stringent  road  safety\r\n\r\nstandards.   LTA will follow up with some minor modifications\r\n\r\nthat  the consultants have suggested to further improve  road\r\n\r\nsafety on these roads.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh asked whether the review can be extended to\r\n\r\nother  roads  as soon as possible.  Yes, LTA  also  plans  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  road safety review for all existing major  roads,\r\n\r\nand  there are about 570 kilometres in length of these  roads\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  So it will take some time and we expect to do\r\n\r\nthe review perhaps over the next three to five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also asked that LTA tap the feedback and\r\n\r\nsuggestions of the public to improve road safety.   Yes,  LTA\r\n\r\nwelcomes public feedback.  The public is encouraged  to  give\r\n\r\ntheir feedback through the LTA hotline or the Feedback Unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked about the policy for road markings and\r\n\r\nsigns.  Road signs and markings are important elements in our\r\n\r\nroad  design for traffic management and to ensure  safety  of\r\n\r\nmotorists.   LTA  has  a signs manual for  implementing  road\r\n\r\nsigns  and markings.  The guidelines in the manual were drawn\r\n\r\nfrom  manuals  used overseas, for example, UK and  Australia,\r\n\r\nand  adopted for local use.  The manual has been updated from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time to make it current.  For instance, it  is  now\r\n\r\nbeing amended to include guidelines for the use and placement\r\n\r\nof variable message signs (VMS) used in connection with EMAS.\r\n\r\nWe   did  not  have  VMS  earlier.   The  signs  manual  sets\r\n\r\nguidelines  for a number of things.  For example, the  siting\r\n\r\nof signs, ie, the distance from the decision point, the types\r\n\r\nof  destinations to be included and the order they should  be\r\n\r\ndisplayed,  the size of the letterings for different  speeds,\r\n\r\nthe   spacing  between  letters  on  the  sign,  the   colour\r\n\r\ncombinations  for the different types of signs, for  example,\r\n\r\nyellow  on  green for expressways, white on green  for  other\r\n\r\nroads,  white  on brown for tourist sites,  etc.   Also,  the\r\n\r\nspecifications  of  the  material  used  are   all   in   the\r\n\r\nguidelines.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High quality materials have been used to ensure their\r\n\r\neffectiveness and to minimise maintenance cost.  LTA has used\r\n\r\ndurable  thermo  plastic painting with glass  beads  as  road\r\n\r\nmarking material for the lanes along our roads.  This ensures\r\n\r\nthat the carriageways are well delineated both\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  day  and  night.  However, the visibility  of  these\r\n\r\nmarkings  may  be  affected by rain at  night.   One  way  to\r\n\r\novercome this problem is to use cat'-s eyes or road studs, as\r\n\r\nproposed  by Prof. Toh.  LTA had used these studs  mainly  to\r\n\r\ndelineate  some  of the turnoff points to  the  exit  of  the\r\n\r\nexpressways.  These studs are currently not used on the  main\r\n\r\nlanes  on  the  expressways  because  the  safety  impact  on\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists is still uncertain.  In other words, what would\r\n\r\nhappen  if motorcyclists ride between lanes or change  lanes.\r\n\r\nLTA  will  therefore continue to study the issue closely  and\r\n\r\nsee  whether  there are other options to address  the  issue.\r\n\r\nEarlier,  Prof.  Chin  was proposing  using  studs  to  guide\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists or impose a discipline on them.  As I said,  we\r\n\r\nhave to also look at the safety issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for road signs, electro reflective sheetings for road\r\n\r\nsigns  are  also used to improve their visibility, especially\r\n\r\nat  night.   In view of the ageing population, LTA  has  been\r\n\r\nprogressively upgrading the existing directional signs  along\r\n\r\nour  roads and expressways by using better grades of  electro\r\n\r\nreflective sheeting.  It also has a programme to upgrade  our\r\n\r\nstreet   name  boards  and  traffic  signs  to  improve   the\r\n\r\nvisibility of these signs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about the maintenance cost. Annually,\r\n\r\nabout  $2.5  million  is  spent on the  maintenance  of  road\r\n\r\nmarkings  and  another $1 million on the maintenance  of  the\r\n\r\n85,000  road  signs  in  Singapore.   The  maintenance  works\r\n\r\ninclude washing, replacement of old and damaged signs.   This\r\n\r\ncost  is not high, considering that a good maintenance regime\r\n\r\nis  essential to ensure that the road markings and road signs\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  serve  their purposes so  that  safety  of  the\r\n\r\nmotorists is not compromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin commented on the exit and entry points along\r\n\r\nexpressways.  I assure Prof. Chin that the locations  of  the\r\n\r\nentries  and  exits  along  the  expressways  were  carefully\r\n\r\nstudied  before  construction.  The  present  arrangement  is\r\n\r\nconsidered to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noptimum,  in  terms of traffic functional requirement,  given\r\n\r\nthe  land available.  It will be ideal if we could have exits\r\n\r\nfrom the entrance to expressways spread out.  This would  cut\r\n\r\ndown  confluence and convergence.  However, with our  limited\r\n\r\nland  and dense expressway network intersecting major  roads,\r\n\r\njunctions  are frequent and necessary.  In general,  we  will\r\n\r\nprevent access to expressways from the minor roads.  However,\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of CTE, which he has brought up,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for the connection to the major roads, such as  from\r\n\r\nBraddell  Road  and PIE.  If we do not do  so,  then  traffic\r\n\r\nintending to join or leave the CTE has to go to the  adjacent\r\n\r\nparallel roads, such as Thomson Road or Upper Serangoon Road,\r\n\r\nwhere  traffic conditions are also heavy.  The congestion  at\r\n\r\nthe  CTE  between PIE and Braddell is mainly due to the  very\r\n\r\nhigh  volume  of  traffic  and partly  also  because  traffic\r\n\r\nexiting at Braddell is backed up to the expressway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I note that Prof. Chin's real concern is\r\n\r\nthe  way  in  which we can reduce the traffic congestion.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  inform him that the LTA  is  constructing  a\r\n\r\nvehicular underpass along Braddell Road.  This underpass will\r\n\r\nbe  ready by December 2002 and will improve the situation  at\r\n\r\nthe  interchange  between the CTE  and  Braddell  Road.   LTA\r\n\r\nexpects  that, with the underpass in place, more  green  time\r\n\r\nwould be available to allow traffic from the CTE to exit into\r\n\r\nBraddell Road, thereby easing the congestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On bad driving habits, LTA will step up its education\r\n\r\nprogramme.  I believe that is what Prof. Chin would  like  to\r\n\r\nsee,  ie, more education.  And LTA will continue to work with\r\n\r\nthe  Traffic  Police and other relevant agencies  to  educate\r\n\r\ndrivers  on  good driving habits and discourage  bad  driving\r\n\r\nhabits,  including dangerous lane switching  and  tailgating.\r\n\r\nProf.   Chin  has  also  suggested  using,  what  he   calls,\r\n\r\n\"chevron\". Basically, it is a  safe-distance guide marking on\r\n\r\nexpressways  to allow motorists to keep a safe  distance.   I\r\n\r\nwould  ask  LTA to look into his suggestion.  LTA  will  also\r\n\r\nstudy,  perhaps  instead  of studs, whether  raised  pavement\r\n\r\nmarkers can be used to discourage dangerous lane switching.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Prof. Chin's concern about fog lamps,\r\n\r\nthese  lamps are designed to project a low and diffused light\r\n\r\nto assist the drivers to see road markings more clearly under\r\n\r\nfoggy conditions when visibility is very poor.  The authority\r\n\r\ndecided  to  allow the installation of fog lamps  to  improve\r\n\r\nvisibility  following the bad haze experience  in  1994.   If\r\n\r\napproved  fog lamps are properly installed, they  should  not\r\n\r\nblind  other road users.  LTA has advised vehicle  owners  on\r\n\r\nthe  proper design and installation of the fog lamps.  During\r\n\r\nthe  mandatory periodic inspection, vehicle owners  would  be\r\n\r\nrequired to remove or cover the lamps, if their vehicles  are\r\n\r\nfound  with  unapproved or improperly  installed  fog  lamps.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the LTA will continue to monitor the  situation\r\n\r\nclosely  and, if necessary, step up enforcement of unapproved\r\n\r\nor improperly installed fog lamps.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now, I come to Mdm Claire Chiang's issue. She\r\n\r\nbrought  up  the  issue  of  safe transportation  for  school\r\n\r\nchildren again.  I share Mdm Chiang's concern over the safety\r\n\r\nof  our school children when travelling in school buses.  But\r\n\r\nshe  seems  to  think that the safety of the school  children\r\n\r\ntaking  school bus is compromised.  I would like to reiterate\r\n\r\nto her that their safety is not compromised.  That is because\r\n\r\nwe  have  at  the moment a number of measures.  Firstly,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  we  require the bus to fulfil stringent  technical\r\n\r\nrequirements.  Secondly, we require the bus drivers to have a\r\n\r\nvocational  licence  and  medical  check-ups.   Thirdly,   we\r\n\r\nrequire  the bus to have a bus attendant.  Fourthly, the  bus\r\n\r\ncannot exceed the speed limit of 50 kilometres per hour.  All\r\n\r\nthese  measures  have helped us to maintain the  good  safety\r\n\r\nrecord that we have.  But, nevertheless, it is always good to\r\n\r\nsee how we can look for other ways to enhance road safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would ask LTA to do three things. Firstly, I would\r\n\r\nask  LTA  to monitor the safety records closely and  look  at\r\n\r\ntrends  and  indications  whether  safety  is  being  eroded.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I would ask LTA to discuss with MOE and school  bus\r\n\r\noperators to find cost effective ways to enhance the  safety.\r\n\r\nTo Mdm Claire\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChiang,  perhaps she does not mind paying.  But I  think  the\r\n\r\ncost  effectiveness  and cost levels  must  be  a  legitimate\r\n\r\nconcern.  If there is a diminishing return, I do not think it\r\n\r\nis  wise to do something which may not be necessary.  But  we\r\n\r\nwill  look  at  how  we can reduce cost,  for  instance,  for\r\n\r\ninstalling  seat belts or back padding, and so on.   And,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  I would enlist her help to look at how  the  cost\r\n\r\nissues  can be addressed.  Thirdly, I would also ask  LTA  to\r\n\r\nstep  up  the training of the school bus attendants  and  the\r\n\r\nenforcement of their responsibilities.  So I think these  are\r\n\r\nthe  things  that  we  can do instead of mandating  that  all\r\n\r\nschool  buses must install seat belts.  Because,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  before,  from  our preliminary calculations,  the  cost\r\n\r\nimplications are not a small one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked how we plan public\r\n\r\ntransport and bus services in HDB new towns.  At the planning\r\n\r\nstage  of  a  new HDB town, the bus operator responsible  for\r\n\r\nproviding  bus  services  for  the  town  would  put  up  the\r\n\r\nconceptual  bus plan based on the bus service  guidelines  of\r\n\r\nthe  Public Transport Council.  The bus plan would take  into\r\n\r\naccount HDB's inputs on the size of the town, ultimate number\r\n\r\nof  dwelling units, estimated population, land use  and  road\r\n\r\nsystem  for the town.  Bus stop locations are also identified\r\n\r\nduring the planning stage and are indicated in a road-related\r\n\r\nfacilities  plan.  The authorities concerned,  HDB  and  LTA,\r\n\r\nmake provisions for these facilities at the development stage\r\n\r\nwhen  the  roads  are constructed.  There is an  inter-agency\r\n\r\ncommittee  and they meet quarterly and all these  issues  are\r\n\r\ndiscussed  and  implemented.   In  the  initial  stage   when\r\n\r\nresidents start moving into the town, the bus operator  would\r\n\r\nimplement bus routes to the CBD and other employment  centres\r\n\r\nas  well  as  links  to  the  MRT  station,  interchange  and\r\n\r\namenities  in  nearby towns.  The operator is  provided  with\r\n\r\nHDB's  staging  plans  for the town's  development  and  will\r\n\r\nintroduce  more bus routes in tandem with the growth  of  the\r\n\r\ntown.  Routes are planned in accordance with the travel needs\r\n\r\nof  residents which are assessed through surveys  at  various\r\n\r\nstages of the town's development.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked about the premium bus service. The\r\n\r\npremium bus service serves a niche requirement and it  serves\r\n\r\nto  complement  the trunk service provided by  the  main  bus\r\n\r\noperator.   If  necessary,  we  can  always  introduce   such\r\n\r\nservices.  He mentioned about the publicity of such services.\r\n\r\nYes, I would ask LTA to look into how we can get the operator\r\n\r\nto  publicise  them  and  to ensure that  their  numbers  are\r\n\r\ndisplayed properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin also asked about the bus shelters' design.\r\n\r\nBus  shelters  are designed taking into account  construction\r\n\r\nand  maintenance cost as well as comfort for commuters.  Most\r\n\r\nbus shelters today are three metres wide.  Newer bus shelters\r\n\r\nhave  been  installed  with panels  which  serve  to  shelter\r\n\r\ncommuters from the rain.  Presently, about a quarter  of  all\r\n\r\nbus  shelters  have such panels.  The design and construction\r\n\r\nmaterials of the shelters will continue to be reviewed by the\r\n\r\nLTA  so  as to improve comfort for commuters while minimising\r\n\r\ncosts.   We welcome any new ideas that Members have that  can\r\n\r\ncontribute to a better design.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rain shelters, LTA recognises the plight of the\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists during heavy downpours and has thus constructed\r\n\r\nrain  shelters  under  flyovers  for  their  use.  These  are\r\n\r\nconcrete  bays, located away from the traffic flow to  ensure\r\n\r\nthe safety of all motorists.  LTA has provided these shelters\r\n\r\nunder all flyovers where space permits.  LTA will continue to\r\n\r\nimprove  the existing rain shelters by expanding the bays  to\r\n\r\naccommodate more motorcyclists, where possible.  It will also\r\n\r\nexplore   ways   to   overcome  space  constraints,   without\r\n\r\ncompromising  the safety of motorists. In view  of  our  high\r\n\r\nrainfall,  motorcyclists should also be  prepared  by  having\r\n\r\nraincoats at hand in case of inclement weather.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked me to update him on the progress of\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  bus  shelters.  In Phase I, LTA  has  upgraded\r\n\r\nnearly 900 bus shelters and there are more than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3,000  bus  shelters to go. LTA will carry out the  upgrading\r\n\r\nover the next four years and the plan is for LTA to call  for\r\n\r\ntenders  and  to  ask the contractors to  design,  build  and\r\n\r\noperate  these  shelters.  LTA will, of course,  specify  the\r\n\r\nlocations and the design specifications for the bus shelters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong raised three issues. Firstly, he asked about the\r\n\r\npavement  design.   With  regard to standardised  design  for\r\n\r\nfootpaths and pavements, I agree with Mr Ong that this  would\r\n\r\nmake  sweeping by mechanised road-sweepers easier.  LTA  has,\r\n\r\nin fact, already introduced such guidelines. However, many of\r\n\r\nthe  existing pavements were built way before we standardised\r\n\r\ntheir  designs, hence, the variety of different  layouts  and\r\n\r\ncharacteristics, as pointed out by Mr Ong.  As most of  these\r\n\r\nfootpaths are still in good condition, it would be a waste of\r\n\r\npublic funds to reconstruct them to the latest standards.  We\r\n\r\nwill  replace  them when necessary and, in the meantime,  LTA\r\n\r\nwill  discuss  with ENV on ways to improve the efficiency  of\r\n\r\nmechanical road sweeping for these older pavements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On linkway design, for the linkways built by LTA, LTA\r\n\r\nhas  adopted a few standard designs of basic form.   However,\r\n\r\nthese  covered linkways are often connected to a  variety  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  amenities of different designs.  Hence,  there  is\r\n\r\nalso  a need to see that the covered linkways can be designed\r\n\r\nto  blend in with the surroundings.  LTA tries to maintain  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between  the  two.  As for linkways  built  by  town\r\n\r\ncouncils  between flats and other buildings, HDB  has,  since\r\n\r\n1997,  provided  15  designs of linkways for  town  councils'\r\n\r\nreference  to  assist  them  and  their  consultants  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of linkways.  The designs have been standardised\r\n\r\nto   expedite  processing  time  and  cut  down  cost,  which\r\n\r\naddresses  Mr Ong's concern, and at the same time, provide  a\r\n\r\nsufficient variety of choices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked whether we can install escalators on\r\n\r\noverhead  pedestrian  crossings and underpasses.   Escalators\r\n\r\nhave been provided for many pedestrian overhead bridges which\r\n\r\nare connected to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshopping centres. The reasons for installing them at shopping\r\n\r\ncentres   are,  firstly,  the  heavy  usage  by  pedestrians;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  the  mechanical and electrical equipment  will  be\r\n\r\nunder cover and protected from rainwater; and thirdly, if the\r\n\r\nescalators break down due to faults or vandalism,  there  are\r\n\r\nthe  security personnel at the shopping centres to  put  them\r\n\r\nback into operation quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For expressways, we will build pedestrian bridges or\r\n\r\nunderpasses  with  ramps.  For  other  overhead  bridges  and\r\n\r\nunderpasses, we will look into the various factors,  such  as\r\n\r\nsite   constraint   for  ramps,  vehicular  traffic   volume,\r\n\r\npedestrian  traffic volume, cost-effectiveness of  escalators\r\n\r\nand their operational problems, and review how safety and the\r\n\r\nneed  to cater to the elderly can be met.  I believe  I  have\r\n\r\nanswered all the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim):</b> Sir, Prof. Chin has made a call to MCIT and\r\n\r\nLTA  to  review the way we treat offences.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nthank Prof. Chin for his thoughtful suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the introduction of the\r\n\r\nadministrative  surcharge as a first stage  in  dealing  with\r\n\r\ncertain   ERP  violations  actually  arose  from  a   similar\r\n\r\nsuggestion made by Prof. Chin at the debate in the  Committee\r\n\r\nof  Supply last year.  Here, I would like to point  out  that\r\n\r\nProf. Chin's latest suggestion is somewhat different from his\r\n\r\nearlier  one.  The  rationale for  the  introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nadministrative surcharge for ERP violations was  premised  on\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  ERP enforcement is almost 100%.  Hence,  any\r\n\r\nviolation  is mainly due to forgetfulness or carelessness  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of the motorists. This is not the case  for  other\r\n\r\noffences, such as eating at MRT stations, when enforcement is\r\n\r\nmore   difficult  and  we  would  have  to  rely  on   public\r\n\r\ncooperation not to dirty our trains and MRT stations.   While\r\n\r\nSMRT  would like to avoid fining commuters, sometimes  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  drive home the point that  people  should  not\r\n\r\nengage in such inconsiderate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbehaviour.  But, nonetheless, Prof. Chin's suggestion  is  an\r\n\r\ninteresting one which I would ask LTA to look into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh has asked whether my Ministry has any plans to\r\n\r\nencourage  the use of more environmentally friendly  cars  on\r\n\r\nour  roads.  It  is  indeed  true that  today,  there  is  an\r\n\r\nincreasing awareness of the environmental pollution caused by\r\n\r\nthe  combustion  of conventional fuels. Some  countries  have\r\n\r\nembarked  on  the development of green vehicles that  utilise\r\n\r\nalternative fuels. Such green vehicles include electric, fuel\r\n\r\ncell and hybrid vehicles.  Recent technological advances have\r\n\r\nplaced such vehicles closer to reality and some have actually\r\n\r\nbecome available for sale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a land transport perspective, we have no objections\r\n\r\nto  the  use of green vehicles on our roads, as long as  they\r\n\r\nmeet  established safety standards. As these  green  vehicles\r\n\r\nalso  occupy  road space and they contribute  to  congestion,\r\n\r\nthey will be subjected to the same registration and licensing\r\n\r\nrequirements  for conventional vehicles. As such,  all  green\r\n\r\nvehicles  will  similarly be required  to  pay  COE  and  ERP\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we recognise that these vehicles are less pollutive\r\n\r\nat  the  point of usage, as compared to conventional vehicles\r\n\r\nusing  petroleum-based  fuels.   Therefore,  my  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nexamining  if tax incentives should be provided, as suggested\r\n\r\nby  Prof.  Toh,  to promote their use in Singapore.  We  will\r\n\r\ncarefully  study  this  together with  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment and Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to thank both Dr Lily Neo and Mr\r\n\r\nGerard  Ee for making a call for a scheme for older  cars  or\r\n\r\ncars  older than 20 years old. Today, as we know, there is  a\r\n\r\nvintage car scheme where special tax concessions are given to\r\n\r\ncars  manufactured  before 1940. Under a  restricted  scheme,\r\n\r\nthese  vintage cars enjoy COE exemption and, in return,  they\r\n\r\nmay  only be used for a maximum of 28 days a year. There  are\r\n\r\nabout 100 vintage cars in Singapore. Internationally, cars\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanufactured   during  the  pre-war  period   are   generally\r\n\r\nrecognised   as   vintage  cars.   However,   there   is   no\r\n\r\ninternational  agreement on what constitutes a  classic  car.\r\n\r\nSome  clubs and associations use a criterion where  cars  are\r\n\r\ndeemed  classic if they were manufactured more than 20  years\r\n\r\nago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, there are currently about 31,000 cars\r\n\r\nabove  20  years of age.  I am sure Members will  agree  that\r\n\r\n31,000  is  quite  a large number and that not  all  of  them\r\n\r\npossess  a heritage value.  In fact, it is very difficult  to\r\n\r\nassess the heritage value of these cars.  Therefore, we  must\r\n\r\nbe  very cautious about granting any concessions for  such  a\r\n\r\nlarge  group  of  cars  as this would greatly  undermine  our\r\n\r\nexisting    policies   which   are   tough   but   necessary.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we do not want a situation where there  are  too\r\n\r\nmany  old cars on our streets as owners take advantage  of  a\r\n\r\ngenerous concession scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For owners who do not want to use their cars on a\r\n\r\nregular  basis,  there  is an existing  off-peak  car  scheme\r\n\r\n(OPC).  Under this scheme, owners pay reduced taxes in return\r\n\r\nfor  using their cars during off-peak periods.  Moreover,  as\r\n\r\nwe  further  shift the balance between the  upfront  cost  of\r\n\r\nowning  a car to usage cost via the ERP and road tax rebates,\r\n\r\nthe  financial burden for the retention of these classic cars\r\n\r\nunder  the OPC will further be minimised. Car owners and  car\r\n\r\nenthusiasts may wish to consider the OPC scheme,  which  will\r\n\r\nhelp them to reduce cost somewhat although, obviously, not to\r\n\r\nthe same extent as  complete COE exemption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult for us to justify COE exemption or the\r\n\r\npayment  of  a lower PQP for this large group of 31,000  cars\r\n\r\nwhen  their  heritage value cannot be ascertained objectively\r\n\r\nand  definitively.   The COE, as has been  explained  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  is  a  basic  component of  vehicle  ownership  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. COE exemption is given only to a select  group  of\r\n\r\nvehicles that include scheduled buses, emergency vehicles and\r\n\r\nthose for the handicapped.  Hence, any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreatment  for  cars  over 20 years  old  must  be  evaluated\r\n\r\nagainst  the  adverse impact they would have on  our  overall\r\n\r\nvehicle quota system.  However, my Ministry will continue  to\r\n\r\nreview  the feasibility of having a classic class scheme  and\r\n\r\nwhat this would entail for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, with your indulgence, I\r\n\r\ndid  also  ask  the Ministry whether they could  give  us  an\r\n\r\nupdate  on  the effectiveness of the KJE and if  it  will  be\r\n\r\nextended  to other expressways.  Could I ask if Dr John  Chen\r\n\r\nhas an answer to that also?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> I have answered him.

The  Minister   actually\r\n\r\ntouched  upon the merger of COE categories in his  reply  and\r\n\r\nhas  said that it is a good proposal because it brings  about\r\n\r\nvery stable COE prices. May I remind him that in the Question\r\n\r\nfor  Oral  Answer,  I  actually asked a similar  question  on\r\n\r\nmerger of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOEs and the MOS has replied to my question on the impact  of\r\n\r\nthe  merger of COE categories, that is, the merger was  based\r\n\r\non   non-budgetary  consideration.   In  fact,  it  would  be\r\n\r\npossible  that the merging of the COE categories  will  bring\r\n\r\nabout a lowering of revenue collected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek a clarification on page 18 of the\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement  for FY2000.  It says, \"Revenue  for  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  taxes  is expected to increase  by  35.5%  to  $1.6\r\n\r\nbillion and this is due to more COEs released for quota  year\r\n\r\n1999  and the registration of more vehicles with higher  open\r\n\r\nmarket  value following the merger of the COE categories  and\r\n\r\nalso  the recovery of the economy.\"  May I ask how could  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  once  again,  under-estimate  the  impact  on  the\r\n\r\nrevenue   collected  following  the  merging   of   the   COE\r\n\r\ncategories?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the reply given by my MOS to Dr\r\n\r\nWang is correct.  The merging of the four categories into two\r\n\r\ncategories is not because of budgetary reasons. We did not do\r\n\r\nthat  in  order  to  raise more revenue.  So  the  answer  is\r\n\r\ncorrect.  My point to Mr Chay is also correct when  he  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is  stability and whether it  has  helped  to\r\n\r\nstabilise the COE prices. As the figures have shown, what the\r\n\r\nGPC Review Committee had expected has come true, that is,  by\r\n\r\nmerging  the  four  categories into two,  it  has  helped  to\r\n\r\nstabilise COE prices. As to why there is an increase  in  the\r\n\r\nCOE  collections, the answer is very simple. As  stated,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of quotas for 1999 has been much higher than in  1998.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  as the economy has recovered, the COE prices  also\r\n\r\nrecovered.  Most car dealers will tell you that if  you  want\r\n\r\nto know about COE prices, look at the stock market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I am actually referring to the\r\n\r\noperative   words  in  the  statement  that   says   \".   the\r\n\r\nregistration  of more vehicles with higher open market  value\r\n\r\nfollowing the merger of the COE categories.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Which page is it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> It is at page 18, paragraph 4 or 5.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, the merging of the two categories  actually\r\n\r\nresulted in registration of vehicles with higher open  market\r\n\r\nvalue, ie, bigger cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, with the merging of the two\r\n\r\ncategories, the advantage is that the user can decide whether\r\n\r\nhe  wants, with the same COE, to purchase a higher value  car\r\n\r\nor  a  lower  value  car.  In the past, we forced  people  to\r\n\r\ncompete  in the small category and having bidded successfully\r\n\r\nfor  Category 1, they have no choice but to buy a small  car.\r\n\r\nNow, they can decide whether they want to buy a bigger car or\r\n\r\na smaller car.  It shows that the market prefers a bigger car\r\n\r\nand,  of course, a bigger car has a higher open market value.\r\n\r\nThat is the consequence and there is a choice, not because of\r\n\r\nour  intention of trying to rake in more revenue, but  it  is\r\n\r\nactually to allow Singaporeans to have more choices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, may I inform the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  that  some Singaporeans are indeed very  happy  to  be\r\n\r\nforced  to  compete in the small car category.

And  if we have a very small number,  the  COE\r\n\r\nprices  tend  to fluctuate, and that is not  good.   For  any\r\n\r\nsystem, if there are large fluctuations in prices, it is  not\r\n\r\ngood.  On  top  of that, experience has shown  that  the  COE\r\n\r\nprices for Category 1 were not too far behind the Category  2\r\n\r\nprices and, at times, exceeded the Category 2 prices.  So  we\r\n\r\nmade  a  judgment  and we feel that by merging,  we  actually\r\n\r\neliminate the pitfalls and provide more choices.

I have always thought that the ERP was introduced\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  congestion, and the vehicle quota  system  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  car  population.  Having introduced  these  two\r\n\r\nmeasures, is there still relevance for a premium on road tax,\r\n\r\nother  than penalising those who cannot afford to buy  a  new\r\n\r\ncar and have to keep their cars for a further 10 years?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The  reason why that is in place is that we  want  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  we  have a relatively young car  population  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   That is the policy that we have  adopted.   But,\r\n\r\ncertainly, in view of the call now to consider whether or not\r\n\r\nthere  is  provision  for older cars in  Singapore,  we  will\r\n\r\nconsider  all these factors in our review on the  feasibility\r\n\r\nof having a classic car scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I just like to reiterate that the\r\n\r\nstability of COE prices has been brought about at a price, in\r\n\r\nother words, at a price that some Singaporeans are unable  to\r\n\r\npurchase small cars of their own choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the price of a COE and the price\r\n\r\nof  a  car are very much related to the state of the economy.\r\n\r\nWhen the economy is doing very well, when people are keen  to\r\n\r\nbuy  new cars, they bid up the price of the COE.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  having got the COE, they now have to decide what  sort\r\n\r\nof  car they want to buy.  Do they buy a cheap import  or  do\r\n\r\nthey buy a European import that may be double the price?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the economy did very well. Whereas in the\r\n\r\npast, a person with, say, category A, may have bought a small\r\n\r\ncar,  but  because  of the better state of  the  economy,  he\r\n\r\ndecides to buy a car which is of a higher value, and he  gets\r\n\r\na  higher  OMV.  So, the system is one which is very open and\r\n\r\nit  gives the consumers the ultimate choice  -  how  much  to\r\n\r\nbid, what to buy and how much to pay for the car.  It\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  all within his control, and he has to buy something  that\r\n\r\nfits  his budget and pocket.

I do not think people  will  go\r\n\r\nand  bid  for a COE and having got a COE, then decide whether\r\n\r\nthey  want  to  buy a small car, a big car or a  luxury  car.\r\n\r\nHaving  obtained a COE, within a period of six months, unless\r\n\r\nI  strike a lottery, I am unlikely to buy a bigger car than I\r\n\r\noriginally planned to do so.  I think the sequence  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has illustrated is completely the reverse  of  what\r\n\r\nordinary Singaporeans would do when purchasing cars.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I have tried to simplify it for\r\n\r\nthe  Member.  Basically, when a person buys a car, first,  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  even  bid for the COE, which is why the  Committee\r\n\r\ncame  out with this proposal to have open bidding so that  we\r\n\r\ncan  encourage more Singaporeans to bid and therefore  be  in\r\n\r\nbetter  control.  But the decision is made based on  what  is\r\n\r\nthe COE price and, ultimately, what is the total price of the\r\n\r\ncar, which is why I said it depends on what is his budget and\r\n\r\nwhat he can afford from his pocket.  And that is the ultimate\r\n\r\ncost all roped in  -  COE, OMV, taxes, the whole works, which\r\n\r\nis the price of the car on the road.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I agree with Dr\r\n\r\nWang  that  the  decision to buy a car is made  first  before\r\n\r\ngetting  a COE.  But I want to go back to the point that  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State made on price fluctuations.  In my opinion,\r\n\r\nwhy do we not let market forces decide, rather than we try to\r\n\r\ncontrol  price fluctuations. On one occasion, the  COE  price\r\n\r\ndropped  to $50 and $50,000 on another occasion.   We  should\r\n\r\nlet  the  market decide and if people decide to bid  in  that\r\n\r\nway, I think we should let it be and give the flexibility  to\r\n\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, that is precisely what we\r\n\r\nare doing, to let the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarket decide what cars they want to buy.

Let me remind\r\n\r\nMembers  that before the merger, the numbers for  category  1\r\n\r\nover  the  years were dropping.  And just before the  merger,\r\n\r\nthe number was only 100-plus a month.  It was getting smaller\r\n\r\nand  smaller.   Is  that desirable?  And why  is  the  number\r\n\r\ngetting  smaller  and smaller?  Because  we  have  allowed  a\r\n\r\nmechanism via the open category to allow the market to decide\r\n\r\nwhat  choice  of  cars people want to buy, and  that  is  the\r\n\r\nsignal we were receiving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh said that he agrees with Dr Wang\r\n\r\nthat  the people would decide what car to buy first.  I agree\r\n\r\nwith  him.  That is also what happened under the new  system,\r\n\r\nwhich shows that people prefer to buy a higher cc car.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Sir, for\r\n\r\nletting me join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we made this recommendation in the VQS report, we\r\n\r\nhave always been haunted by this issue.  Actually, one of the\r\n\r\nterms  of  reference  of  the VQS study,  I  want  to  remind\r\n\r\nMembers, is the stability in the quota prices.  As a term  of\r\n\r\nreference, that was one of the considerations.  It was not  a\r\n\r\nbudgetary or fiscal revenue collection consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure, as rightly pointed out by the Minister of\r\n\r\nState,  for  Category A, below 1,000 cc, was  actually  very,\r\n\r\nvery  small.   As  the figure gets smaller and  smaller,  the\r\n\r\ntendency for fluctuation in value becomes very high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ang Mo Kio asked about why do we not let\r\n\r\nthe  market  decide.  Precisely, there was  this  problem  of\r\n\r\ngreat fluctuations in the prices of COE  -  we had an outcome\r\n\r\nof $50 and so on  -\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand this was one of the issues that we wanted to address.   I\r\n\r\nwould just like to make this clarification that the stability\r\n\r\nin  the COE prices was one of the considerations in the terms\r\n\r\nof reference.  It was never a budgetary or revenue collection\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing is on the open market value. Actually,\r\n\r\nif  the consumer wants to, he can still buy a smaller car and\r\n\r\nthe  OMV would be small, even in the present situation.   But\r\n\r\nthen the question is, what is the COE price that he will have\r\n\r\nto  bid?   The principle on which the Committee went  by  was\r\n\r\nthat  every user of the road is occupying a certain space  on\r\n\r\nthe  road and should be considered equally, not just  because\r\n\r\nsomebody  says his is a smaller car, therefore, he should  be\r\n\r\ncharged  at  a  lower  rate.  If we want  to  address  equity\r\n\r\nreasons, then let us address it through differential rates of\r\n\r\ntaxation, road tax for cars and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, as far as I can recall, we only\r\n\r\nhad  one  point  in  history  where  the  COE  prices  really\r\n\r\nfluctuated  from  a big amount to $50.  Other  than  that,  I\r\n\r\nthink  throughout  the time the COE system  has  worked,  the\r\n\r\nprices  were determined by market forces.  In my opinion,  if\r\n\r\nwe  had  continued  with the old categories  and  let  market\r\n\r\nforces  decide on how to distribute the number of quotas  for\r\n\r\nthe  various  categories, I do not think we  will  see  major\r\n\r\nprice fluctuations, as what the suspicion is.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I shall close the debate by having\r\n\r\nthe last word.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we follow what Mr Singh has said, I think we are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  in for a lot of trouble.  His closing  remarks\r\n\r\nwere  to  let the market decide on the distribution.   If  we\r\n\r\ntake it to the ultimate, we will only have one category.   Is\r\n\r\nthat what Mr Singh is proposing?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Why not?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I will remember that in the future.\r\n\r\nIn  any  case, as regards price fluctuations, as I  mentioned\r\n\r\njust\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow,  under  the old scheme, the fluctuations  were  actually\r\n\r\nquite  significant, going up to 160% at one stage,  month  to\r\n\r\nmonth.  I do not think that is really in the interest of  the\r\n\r\nconsumers,  because  I  understand  that  most  of  the   car\r\n\r\ncompanies  take a buyer's order with the provision  that  the\r\n\r\nfinal  price would depend very much on the COE price.   If  a\r\n\r\ncar  buyer works with a limited budget and the COE  price  is\r\n\r\njumping like crazy and is going upwards, I think he is  going\r\n\r\nto  be  on  tenterhooks.  So, it is better  that  we  have  a\r\n\r\nsystem,  as proposed by the committee, that still allows  the\r\n\r\nmarket to decide what is the final price for the COE, and yet\r\n\r\nhaving a big enough quota number so that while the market can\r\n\r\ndecide, the fluctuation tends to be a little bit less.   That\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean that there is no fluctuation.  If  the  stock\r\n\r\nmarket  is going to triple tomorrow, I am sure the COE prices\r\n\r\nwill likewise go up quite significantly, maybe not triple but\r\n\r\ndefinitely not in the current range of up to 11% or so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think hon.

Some  of the main philosophies  in  such  an\r\n\r\nenvironment  is that we have regulators who are  transparent,\r\n\r\nwho  would  promote good governance in the market and  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  regulators  are impartial in all that  they  do.   And,\r\n\r\nultimately,  of  course, there must be market  efficiency  in\r\n\r\nservices  that are provided.  We have moved in this direction\r\n\r\nin  many  areas.  In the port, for example, we have decoupled\r\n\r\nthe  regulator from the port operator.  So PSA and  MPA  were\r\n\r\nborn.   In  the National Computer Board before it was  merged\r\n\r\ninto the IDA, they had interest in a certification authority.\r\n\r\nBut  when  the NCB became the regulator, they divested  their\r\n\r\ninterest in Netrust.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  we have also taken pains to divest the telecoms operator\r\n\r\nfrom the telecoms regulator, and the broadcast regulator from\r\n\r\nthe  broadcast operator.  I just want to ask why we have  not\r\n\r\ndone  this  for the airport and therefore this  is  something\r\n\r\nthat  makes it an anomaly, not just internationally, but even\r\n\r\nin Singapore itself.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, the Port of Singapore is ranked\r\n\r\nas the busiest port in the world in terms of shipping tonnage\r\n\r\nas well as the top bunkering port.

There  are several new ports  emerging  in  the\r\n\r\nregion  threatening to take away business from the  Singapore\r\n\r\nport.   Of course, at present, the Port of Singapore is still\r\n\r\nranked  No.  1  and support services in Singapore  are  still\r\n\r\nsuperior  compared  to  the  regional  ports.   However,  the\r\n\r\nprospect of major shipping companies moving over to privately\r\n\r\noperated berths in Tanjong Pelapas poses questions of whether\r\n\r\nthe  time is now ripe for some of our own berths in our ports\r\n\r\nto be leased out to private shipping companies to operate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain advantages for berth operations to be\r\n\r\nprivatised.  Shipping companies can lease their berths for  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  time.  Since they have to pay for this they  will\r\n\r\nhave to maximise efficiency down the supply chain to maximise\r\n\r\nvalue.  They can also plan to maximise the use of berths  and\r\n\r\nplan  their turnaround time for mother and feeder vessels  to\r\n\r\nand  from  the region.  There is no doubt that  the  Port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  doing well.  There is also  the  need  to  see\r\n\r\nbeyond tomorrow,\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, actually, I was\r\n\r\ngoing to suggest that we use the cashcard instead of the toll\r\n\r\ncoupon  for  our motorists to go through the Causeway.   But,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry has already made an announcement on this a  few\r\n\r\ndays ago.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  giving us this good news.  But I  have  a  few\r\n\r\nquestions to ask the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some motorists have already purchased a lot of these\r\n\r\ntoll   coupons.  They have not finished using them.  Although\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry said they can be refunded, there is  an  expiry\r\n\r\ndate  for these toll coupons.  Secondly, they have to  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry for the refund. Can we allow them to go to  the\r\n\r\npetrol  stations  or some other outlets to get  a  refund  on\r\n\r\ntheir  unused toll coupons?  This will be more convenient  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, although at various times it has\r\n\r\nbeen  said that, with the explosion going on in the world  of\r\n\r\nthe Internet and e-commerce, the hottest thing in the not too\r\n\r\ndistant  future  is  the  battle for  bandwidth.   Yet  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  the  state of our broadband  Singapore  One\r\n\r\nproject.   There  are today about 30,000 subscribers  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  One  broadband  multimedia  since  it  was   first\r\n\r\nlaunched  commercially  in June 1998.   There  is  a  general\r\n\r\nperceived  lack  of  value  in our broadband  content.   Many\r\n\r\npeople get dissatisfied with the service and switched back to\r\n\r\nthe  narrow  banding Internet service.  My  concern  is  also\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  high rate of technological obsolescence  in\r\n\r\nthis  field.  Why have we not been able to develop a sizeable\r\n\r\ncustomer base to sustain the viability of the project?   This\r\n\r\ncustomer  base is said to be around 200,000.   How  does  the\r\n\r\nagency  intend to go about developing this?  Is there a  time\r\n\r\nframe and content development to reach this base?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the present scheme of charges for the SCV and\r\n\r\nMagix access is too high.  Perhaps to give the industry  more\r\n\r\nscope  for business development, the Minister should consider\r\n\r\nseparating  the  infrastructure  provider  from  the  content\r\n\r\nproviders.   For  example, a service  provider  can  run  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructural  facilities leasing  out  the  bandwidth  and\r\n\r\nleaving  the multimedia content business to others.  In  this\r\n\r\nway, we can give a more focused efficiency to players in  the\r\n\r\nindustry and to give value to the customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I have the same\r\n\r\nconcerns  as Mr Chay.  We have for many years now a broadband\r\n\r\ncapability called Singapore One. At the rate technology  goes\r\n\r\nobsolete  in  this  new  economy, I fear  that  we  might  be\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  while elephant, a monument to a grandiose  dream\r\n\r\nthat  was  not meant to be.  I know there is a  lot  of  talk\r\n\r\nabout how effective and how useful  broadband would be and  I\r\n\r\nthink we need to do something about this base of 30,000  that\r\n\r\nis not attractive to entrepreneurs providing content, because\r\n\r\nwith  30,000  people they do not sell many, many  things  and\r\n\r\nthey are not going to come to  Singapore.  But\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother than the issue which Mr Chay raised about lowering  the\r\n\r\ncost  for the end users, I certainly agree with him that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should look into making it cheaper for  the  end-users.    Right  now,  cable-modem  and  ASDL  are  the   two\r\n\r\ntechnologies  used   -   perhaps we can  look  into  wireless\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  allowing for some kind of  competition  that\r\n\r\nwill drive down the prices, and perhaps for Government to pay\r\n\r\nfor  the  infrastructure in the same way that we pay for  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure in MRT and allow the operator to recover  just\r\n\r\nthe operation revenue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing about the broadband technology we have\r\n\r\nis  that  I  think people forget that the real issue  is  not\r\n\r\ntechnology. We have the technology and we have the best  that\r\n\r\ncan  meet  the world's competition on technology.   They  say\r\n\r\nthat  Bill  Gates  is not really a technology  genius.   Bill\r\n\r\nGates is a marketing genius.  I think that we do not have the\r\n\r\nmarketing genius where Singapore One is concerned.   We  have\r\n\r\nnot been able to sell it well enough.  We have not publicised\r\n\r\nit  enough in the international arena perhaps and we get very\r\n\r\nlittle  response  also partly because the base  is  just  too\r\n\r\nsmall.   So  how  do  we enlarge this  base  and  how  do  we\r\n\r\npublicise  this  infrastructure so that the world  will  come\r\n\r\nrushing down to our doorstep.  Perhaps we need a Li Ka  Shing\r\n\r\nor Richard Li?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I agree with the views\r\n\r\nexpressed by Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Prof. Toh. In this era  of\r\n\r\nInformation technology, information and knowledge travel very\r\n\r\nfast from one part of the world to another.  News on what  is\r\n\r\nhappening  in  this  part of the world  is  transmitted  very\r\n\r\nquickly to another part of the world.  As such, we must speed\r\n\r\nup  our efforts to equip our people with at least some  basic\r\n\r\nknowledge  in  IT  so that they would be  able  to  use  this\r\n\r\nnetwork to obtain all the information they want, quickly  and\r\n\r\naccurately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broadband network is a very important\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.  If we say that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  land  transport system is like blood vessels,  then  the\r\n\r\nbroadband  is like the nervous system in the body.   We  must\r\n\r\nspread  it  throughout the nation and everyone would  have  a\r\n\r\nfeel  of  what  is happening in the world in  order  to  make\r\n\r\nappropriate responses promptly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government is financing the development and\r\n\r\nconstruction of the land transport system, the MRT system and\r\n\r\nthe  telephone system, why is it that the Government has  not\r\n\r\nconsidered  financing  the  installation  of  the   broadband\r\n\r\nnetwork  infrastructure,  so that broadband  access  is  more\r\n\r\naffordable to our people? From what I know, SCV's charge  for\r\n\r\nuse of the broadband is almost double that of Hong Kong's.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the Internet\r\n\r\nrevolution  has  taken the world by storm  but  to  date  the\r\n\r\nEnglish language is the predominant language of the Internet.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly  it  has become clear that Internet  development\r\n\r\nwill  take place in other languages.  The trends seem clearly\r\n\r\nto  indicate the number of people who are going to use  their\r\n\r\nnative  languages  to access the Internet  will  increase  in\r\n\r\nfuture.   In  fact,  recently  the  National  University   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  spawned  off  as  an  individual  business   which\r\n\r\nprovides  registration of domain names  in  other  languages.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,   MITA  in  the past has  encouraged  the  use  of\r\n\r\nChinese  Internet by setting up the Chinese Internet Steering\r\n\r\nCommittee  which has now been spawned off as a  business.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  was  very happy that recently Singaporean  Business\r\n\r\nEnterprises  has got together and spawned off  Huayi.net.  In\r\n\r\nview  of the new development and the future prospects on  the\r\n\r\nInternet  in terms of usage by different languages,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike the Minister to tell us what are the plans that MCIT, in\r\n\r\nparticular, IDA has, for the future development of  Internet,\r\n\r\nparticularly   in  the  Singapore  context  for   the   three\r\n\r\nlanguages, which are Chinese, Malay and Tamil.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Minister Yeo Cheow\r\n\r\nTong announced recently that the Government has planned\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  allocate $25 million in the next three years to give away\r\n\r\nsecond-hand personal computers to 30,000 low income  families\r\n\r\nand  to allow them to surf the Net for free.  This is a  very\r\n\r\ngood idea.  At the same time, every Singaporean above the age\r\n\r\nof  45  years  will  be provided with an e-mail  account  and\r\n\r\npersonal  website,  thereby narrowing  the  gap  between  the\r\n\r\ncomputer savvy and the computer illiterate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, the business community is better informed of\r\n\r\nwhat  is happening in the world through the Internet  and  e-mail.   Through the use of personal computers, they can  gain\r\n\r\naccess  to a wealth of knowledge and information.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe must be computer-literate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC has been offering training on the use of computer\r\n\r\nto  the  workers.  Now that almost every family has a PC  and\r\n\r\nthe fact that housewives and senior citizens are in the habit\r\n\r\nof  watching television programmes, the Ministry may want  to\r\n\r\nwork  hand in hand with TCS to produce some documentaries  on\r\n\r\nthe  use  of computers and information technology, and  teach\r\n\r\nthem  how  to  surf  the  Net.  This is  more  effective  and\r\n\r\neconomical than  employing  2,500 computer experts to  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  RC  centres  and teach the people there.   We  can  also\r\n\r\ncooperate with TCS to telecast to our residents, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  lower income people, the latest news on network updates,\r\n\r\nand recommendations on interesting sites on the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In China, there are regular TV programmes on the latest\r\n\r\ndevelopments  on  information  technology.

Computer\r\n\r\nsecurity  lapse  could  also  lead  to  a  private  citizen's\r\n\r\nsensitive information being revealed through the Government's\r\n\r\ndatabase.   I  think the Government, being the user  of  such\r\n\r\ntechnology, should also be aware of the risks associated with\r\n\r\nit.

Technology must be used  to\r\n\r\nhelp  Singaporeans access information, understand and use  it\r\n\r\nappropriately.   How  do  our  Ministries   fare   in   these\r\n\r\nfunctions?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in June 1998, a researcher analysed for me the\r\n\r\nwebpages of the Ministries of Health, Manpower, Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nand  Community Development.  On the whole, she felt that  the\r\n\r\nwebpages  were  not interactive, information was  inadequate,\r\n\r\nsketchy  and  not  updated, particularly press  releases  and\r\n\r\nspeeches in each Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I had three of my staff spend a whole morning\r\n\r\nsurfing  these same Ministries and one more, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.  It was a morning well spent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  it benefited the staff because they learned so much more\r\n\r\nabout  the  Government  and society.   Their  reactions  were\r\n\r\npositive, indicating a vast improvement from the observations\r\n\r\nmade in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from their responses to the various websites,\r\n\r\nthey  look  for  three things.  First, is  clear  information\r\n\r\nwhich is comprehensive and useful.  For example, one staff in\r\n\r\nher  30s,  single, was drawn to a list of assistance  schemes\r\n\r\nand  range  of services the Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\noffers.  The website of Ministry of Health, to another staff,\r\n\r\na  mother  of  two, was comprehensive, thoroughly educational\r\n\r\nand user-friendly.   She made special mention of two reports.\r\n\r\nFirst, the National Health Survey 1998, and second, Dr Yaacob\r\n\r\nIbrahim's  report  on  employment  and  employability.    She\r\n\r\nbenefited from both reports personally.  As an older  person,\r\n\r\nshe is drawn to the setting up of Silver Manpower Centres  in\r\n\r\nhousing estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The website of MOM was an exciting one for two of my\r\n\r\nstaff  because of the long list of employment agencies posted\r\n\r\non the web.  They were particularly pleased about the Back-to-Work  programme.  I wish I will not lose my staff because  of\r\n\r\nthis information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The website of Education was evidently the most\r\n\r\nthoroughly  prepared, including information  on  the  current\r\n\r\nsystem,  a  section  on PRIME, Programme for  Rebuilding  and\r\n\r\nImproving  Existing  Schools  and  on  Planning  Ahead  about\r\n\r\neducational   choices.   For  parents,  these  segments   are\r\n\r\ninvaluable  information.  My staff drew my attention  to  the\r\n\r\nsection  on  FAQ (frequently asked questions) and found  them\r\n\r\nreassuring.   They  do not feel they are  the  only  ignorant\r\n\r\nparents  or  kiasu  ones.   She also  liked  the  segment  on\r\n\r\nEpisodes   from   the  Singapore  Story,   particularly   the\r\n\r\nphotographs, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing they look for is an interactive format.\r\n\r\nHere,   the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  apart  from  being\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and informative, must be singled\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  for  its  colourful layout and interactive format.   One\r\n\r\nregret  was  that, unless you have CD-ROM, you cannot  access\r\n\r\nthe eCitizen Corner.  So there is a suggestion for setting up\r\n\r\na  chat  room  for young people to express their fears  about\r\n\r\nschool  bullies or gangsters to policemen who can then  serve\r\n\r\nas   on-line   mentors  or  befrienders.   Can  the   various\r\n\r\nMinistries consider setting up a chat forum, like the one  in\r\n\r\nMinistry of the Environment, particularly for the young?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing they look for is fast response. One\r\n\r\nstaff  in  posting  her suggestion to MHA at  11.22  am  that\r\n\r\nmorning  had  an immediate screen response that said:  \"Thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  your  feedback.   We will seriously  consider  your\r\n\r\ncomments and will get back to you if necessary.  Have a  nice\r\n\r\nday.\"  She was pleased by that and she exclaimed, \"Hey,  they\r\n\r\ngot  my  message!\".  To her delight, that afternoon, at  4.23\r\n\r\npm,  an  e-mail  from a Mr Daniel Tan Chee  Kiang  (Corporate\r\n\r\nCommunications  Division) indicated  to  her  that  they  had\r\n\r\naccessed the eCitizen Centre hyperlink and invited her to try\r\n\r\nit  one  more  time.  He thanked her again for bringing  this\r\n\r\nmatter to his attention.  In the words of my staff, \"this  is\r\n\r\nthe  kind of interactive communication we need for Singapore,\r\n\r\nwell done Home Affairs!\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Ministries to assess and update their\r\n\r\nwebsites  regularly.  There are inconsistencies.   There  are\r\n\r\nstill  incomplete information.  For example, MCD has  a  Shop\r\n\r\nFront  retailing books, but when it comes to payment and  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  of  application,  there  is  no  information,   no\r\n\r\nprocedures being set, and no indication of postage or courier\r\n\r\ncharges, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the responses of my three staff, I observed\r\n\r\nthat  this  information is important to them.  But  my  three\r\n\r\nstaff also asked one basic question: what if you do not  have\r\n\r\na computer, how do you access this information?  An even more\r\n\r\nfundamental one, the one that Mr Ravindran just mentioned, is\r\n\r\nwhat  if  you  cannot  read and write English?   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will look into these issues and fully  exploit  the\r\n\r\nInternet as a form of raising\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic   education,  making  information  user-friendly   and\r\n\r\naccessible   for   promoting  mutual  understanding   between\r\n\r\nGovernment and the people sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam is not here.

We had a firm of consultants to help us look into it,\r\n\r\nand  the  conclusion was that there was no really  compelling\r\n\r\nneed to corporatise or privatise CAAS at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an airport operator, CAAS has actually done a\r\n\r\nwonderful job.  The commercial operations in the airport are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactually  farmed  out  to  private  sector  operators.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  airport ground operations, such  as  passenger\r\n\r\ncheck-ins,  baggage  handling, cargo handling,  and  the  in-flight  catering,  are all done by private  sector  companies\r\n\r\nsuch  as  SATS and CIAS.  As a result of all the  efforts  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  airport, Changi Airport has  consistently  been\r\n\r\nrated  as the best airport in the world for many, many years.\r\n\r\nDespite  the fact that CAAS is a statutory board, it has  not\r\n\r\nrested  on  its  laurels.  It has continued to introduce  new\r\n\r\nconcepts   and   new  facilities  to  the  airport,   because\r\n\r\ncompetition  at  the airport level is not just  regional  but\r\n\r\ninternational  as  well.  And with more  long  haul  aircraft\r\n\r\ncoming  in,  I  think the competition is  going  to  be  even\r\n\r\ntougher.  So we need CAAS to remain on its toes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key projects that CAAS is now embarking on is\r\n\r\nthe  development  of  our Terminal 3.   The  construction  of\r\n\r\nTerminal  3 would start shortly.  When completed in the  year\r\n\r\n2006,  Terminal 3 will increase Changi Airport's capacity  to\r\n\r\n64  million passengers from its current 44 million.  So  CAAS\r\n\r\nis  looking into the future, and it will continue to take the\r\n\r\nnecessary    steps    to   maintain   our    competitiveness.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I can assure Prof. Toh that we do  revisit  the\r\n\r\nquestion every so often, because we need to be clear  in  our\r\n\r\nminds  as to whether the time has come to separate those  two\r\n\r\nroles.  So we will continue to revisit that question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Chay Wai Chuen spoke on the\r\n\r\nport.  They asked about competition from other regional ports\r\n\r\nand  how  do we fare against the other ports, and whether  we\r\n\r\nhave  benchmarks.  Both Mr Yeo and Mr Chay also  asked  about\r\n\r\nthe possibility of allowing dedicated terminals to operate in\r\n\r\nour port.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, competition from regional ports has indeed\r\n\r\nintensified  in recent years.  I am sure Members  would  have\r\n\r\nread about the efforts to improve Port Klang, the opening  of\r\n\r\nthe  new Tanjong Pelapas port, which is right next to us, and\r\n\r\nefforts  by ports elsewhere  -  Sri Lanka, Indonesia   -   to\r\n\r\nupgrade and to improve.  In fact, some of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  new ports or upgraded ports have publicly stated  that\r\n\r\ntheir  intent is to not just emulate PSA but to take business\r\n\r\naway  from  PSA.   Tanjong Pelapas, our  new  neighbour,  has\r\n\r\npublicly stated that it is targeting taking away 10% of PSA's\r\n\r\nbusiness.  So the competition is going to be hotting up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Port competition is not new to Singapore. It is\r\n\r\nsomething that we have faced all through the years.  But more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  port  competition is  not  just  from  regional\r\n\r\nports.  Because today the concept of hubbing and treating the\r\n\r\nwhole world as one huge network means that shipping companies\r\n\r\ncan  hub  as far away as, for example, Malta, for the region.\r\n\r\nThey transship in Malta or they can transship in Colombo when\r\n\r\nit  comes  to  shipping containers into our region.   So  the\r\n\r\ncompetition is not just from neighbours but it is really from\r\n\r\nfurther afield as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you that PSA does take all this competition\r\n\r\nvery seriously.  They have embarked on a lot of activities to\r\n\r\nimprove  on their competitiveness.  PSA and both MPA  monitor\r\n\r\nvery   closely   several  indicators,   for   example,   port\r\n\r\nconnectivity.  How many ports is PSA connected  to?   Because\r\n\r\nthe  more ports we are connected to, the more we will be used\r\n\r\nas  a  transshipment centre.  They monitor productivity,  how\r\n\r\nmany  containers are moved, loaded, unloaded.  And they  also\r\n\r\nmonitor  what is the value for money that users get from  our\r\n\r\nport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be happy to know that we are connected to\r\n\r\nmore ports in the world by more shipping lines than any other\r\n\r\nregional ports.  PSA also currently holds the world's  record\r\n\r\nof  moving  234  containers per  hour  from  one  ship.   The\r\n\r\ncompetition  is  not  really  just  on  price  alone.    Many\r\n\r\ncommentators comment quite wrongly on just basing  on  price.\r\n\r\nBecause  we know that you can pay a very low price  for  some\r\n\r\ngoods  but  you get no value.  Whereas if you  pay  a  higher\r\n\r\nprice for other goods and the value is there, it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstill  worth the while paying the higher price.  And that  is\r\n\r\nwhat  PSA  sets  out to do.  It does not compete  to  be  the\r\n\r\nlowest price provided.  They strive very hard to provide  the\r\n\r\nhighest  value  for  your money. And  this  has  resulted  in\r\n\r\ngrowing business for PSA and our port even during the  recent\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis.\r\n\r\nOn  the question of dedicated terminals, both Mr Chay and  Mr\r\n\r\nYeo  asked  whether we will allow dedicated terminals.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Government will introduce competition to the port as and\r\n\r\nwhen  that competition proves necessary and beneficial.   So,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  the  cart  services have  already  been  fully\r\n\r\nliberalised  and  port users now have a choice  of  six  cart\r\n\r\noperators to choose from.  In the area of container  terminal\r\n\r\noperations, PSA is currently the only operator for main lines\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  As I said just now, it does not mean that PSA\r\n\r\nis  a  monopoly  because PSA has to compete for transshipment\r\n\r\nbusiness  with both regional ports as well as  ports  in  the\r\n\r\nSouth Asian and Middle East regions.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transshipments make up more than 80% of PSA's business.\r\n\r\nAs  Members would be aware, transshipment cargo does not have\r\n\r\nto   use   PSA.   They  are  not  meant  for  us,  as   final\r\n\r\ndestinations, and they do not originate from us.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  fact that they use Singapore must be because we are able\r\n\r\nto add value to their business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about dedicated terminals? For those Members who\r\n\r\nare not familiar, dedicated terminals refer to port terminals\r\n\r\nthat  are  managed or owned by shipping companies  to  handle\r\n\r\ntheir  own cargo.  Because of the heavy investments  required\r\n\r\nin  some  ports, some countries do invite shipping  lines  to\r\n\r\ncome  in  and  set up their own terminals.  But quite  often,\r\n\r\nthose  dedicated  terminals  are  present  in  what  we  call\r\n\r\n\"gateway  ports\", that means, the bulk of the  business  from\r\n\r\nthe  shipping  line is with that country where  the  port  is\r\n\r\nsited.   So if there is a lot of outward and inward  shipment\r\n\r\nof  containers to that country, it may be worth while for the\r\n\r\nshipping line, if the shipping line has a lot of business, to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperate its own port rather than use another port.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, PSA is known as a common user\r\n\r\nterminal for our operator which shall serve all ships calling\r\n\r\nat  our  port.  PSA has done a very good job, as I  mentioned\r\n\r\njust   now.    As  a  result,  Singapore  is  now   the   key\r\n\r\ntransshipment  hub in the region.  We were  No.  1  port,  in\r\n\r\nterms of container throughput, last year.  This year, we have\r\n\r\nfallen  to  No. 2.  But it still shows that PSA  has  a  very\r\n\r\ndominant  and successful business.  The high volume of  cargo\r\n\r\nallows  PSA  huge economies of scale. And as a  result,  this\r\n\r\nmakes it attractive for shipping companies to use our port to\r\n\r\ntransship  to  other  ports.  So in a  way,  this  becomes  a\r\n\r\nvirtuous  cycle.   The  more they use  us,  the  greater  the\r\n\r\neconomies  of  scale,  and there will be  more  feeder  lines\r\n\r\nserving us, and the business builds up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When charting the course of the future, we must continue\r\n\r\nto  understand what are the reasons for a common user port to\r\n\r\nbe  successful  and what are the reasons that shipping  lines\r\n\r\nwant  to have their own dedicated terminals.  For the present\r\n\r\nmoment, we do not intend to have dedicated terminals, but  we\r\n\r\nwill  keep an open mind.  We will have to watch the  dynamics\r\n\r\nof the business and the changes in the shipping business.  If\r\n\r\ngood  reasons  exist, we will definitely look seriously  into\r\n\r\nhaving dedicated terminals in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Dr Toh See Kiat, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang\r\n\r\nand,   yesterday,  Dr  Michael  Lim  talked  about  broadband\r\n\r\nmultimedia.    They  commented  that  they   are   not   very\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  This is a very important industry and  service.\r\n\r\nAnd we should make all efforts to make broadband multimedia a\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  Singapore.  Sir, let me first explain  that  the\r\n\r\nbroadband  multimedia market is still in its infancy  in  all\r\n\r\nparts  of the world.  In the USA, broadband adoption is  only\r\n\r\n6%.  In Singapore, we have about 30,000 subscribers, or about\r\n\r\n100,000  users, and the 100,000 users comprise about  14%  of\r\n\r\nall  Internet  users.   So  in  terms  of  penetration  rate,\r\n\r\nbroadband penetration in Singapore is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactually higher than in the US.  From what I hear, we are one\r\n\r\nof  the  highest  in the world.  We were  one  of  the  first\r\n\r\ncountries to spot the tremendous potential for broadband  and\r\n\r\nas  early as 1996, we put in place the Singapore One  network\r\n\r\nwhich  is the backbone of the broadband network.  We want  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  large  and vibrant broadband industry  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause  this would contribute very greatly to  our  goal  of\r\n\r\nbecoming an infocomm hub in the Asia-Pacific.  Because of its\r\n\r\nimportance,  the development of broadband is in fact  one  of\r\n\r\nthe key elements in my Ministry's Infocomm 21 Masterplan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To grow the broadband industry, as mentioned by both Mr\r\n\r\nChay  and Mr Yeo, we need attractive content and also a large\r\n\r\nsubscriber  base.  Both feed on one another.  It  is  like  a\r\n\r\nchicken-and-egg challenge.  Which one comes first,  broadband\r\n\r\ncontent or subscribers.  We feel both are important.  We  can\r\n\r\nattract  more  content  providers  if  we  can  get  a  large\r\n\r\nsubscriber  base.  On the other hand, as mentioned  by  Prof.\r\n\r\nToh,  the subscribers find that the content is not attractive\r\n\r\nand  not  very  exciting.  Therefore, they  do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nsubscribe or they are reluctant to subscribe.  Another factor\r\n\r\nholding back subscribers is the high cost.  Compared to  USA,\r\n\r\nour broadband access is more expensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IDA is working on three initiatives to develop our\r\n\r\nbroadband   sector.   Firstly,  it  is  wooing  new   content\r\n\r\nproviders to come into Singapore and provide content and  hub\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore.  Secondly, we are also assisting the existing\r\n\r\nones  to  upgrade  their  services.  In  fact,  yesterday,  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  about the three marketing trips by  IDA  and  EDB.\r\n\r\nRecently, my Minister of State also went on a trip to the  US\r\n\r\nand  the  objective  of  the trip is also  to  reach  out  to\r\n\r\nbroadband content providers to get them to come and locate in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   So,  in effect, we are actually  marketing  very\r\n\r\naggressively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second initiative, and this is very crucial, is that\r\n\r\nwe  are working very closely with SCV, SingTel and, later on,\r\n\r\nStarHub to reduce consumer prices.  In fact, SCV,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narising  from  our  discussions with them, has  already  gone\r\n\r\nahead  to  reduce their prices.  I understand that  they  are\r\n\r\nquite competitive compared to the regional service providers.\r\n\r\nWith  full liberalisation of the telecommunication sector,  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  Members that we should expect to  see  broadband\r\n\r\nprices coming down in Singapore in the months ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third initiative is that IDA intends to open access\r\n\r\nto  the  infrastructure to other Internet service  providers.\r\n\r\nBy  opening access, I think it will make the broadband sector\r\n\r\nmore competitive and attractive and we should be able to  see\r\n\r\nmore  subscribers arising from that.  We also expect  to  see\r\n\r\nnew  technology  being introduced, wireless  transmission  of\r\n\r\nbroadband.  That is definitely in the works.  And we hope  to\r\n\r\nsee the wireless broadband transmissions coming in later this\r\n\r\nyear or early next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo asked why the Government does not subsidise the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  cable infrastructure  since  it  is  so\r\n\r\nimportant.   Sir,  let me first clarify that  the  Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not subsidise and pay for the telephone infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe telephone company actually makes the investments and they\r\n\r\nexpect  to  make  a  commercial return on those  investments.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the cable infrastructure is an investment made  by\r\n\r\nSCV  and  they  use  it for both their cables  and  broadband\r\n\r\ntransmissions.   I would think that SCV and its  shareholders\r\n\r\nwould  expect  to  have some returns on their  investment  as\r\n\r\nwell.   Nonetheless, the Government recognises the importance\r\n\r\nof  the  broadband infrastructure in our development  into  a\r\n\r\nregional infocomm hub.  We expect that while today,  many  of\r\n\r\nthe  Internet  subscribers are opting for narrow  band,  more\r\n\r\nwill migrate to broadband because the contents will be better\r\n\r\nand prices should be coming down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that we supported the roll-out of\r\n\r\ncables  to  HDB flats and private residential  estates.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment, through the HDB, actually contributed $16 million\r\n\r\ntowards the cabling of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHDB  estates, bringing broadband to all HDB households.   HDB\r\n\r\nflat  dwellers do not have to pay any upfront charges at  all\r\n\r\nfor  the  cable infrastructure.  In addition, the  Government\r\n\r\nhas,  through  IDA,  helped to lower  the  overall  costs  of\r\n\r\nbroadband subscription by subsidising 70% of the cost of  the\r\n\r\nhead-end   equipment  and  the  cable  modems  required   for\r\n\r\nbroadband  services.   For  the  private  homes,  the   cable\r\n\r\ninfrastructure has been rolled out to the kerb.   Because  of\r\n\r\nthe  high  costs of laying the cables to low density  private\r\n\r\nhousing,  SCV  has decided to charge individual house  owners\r\n\r\nfor the last mile of cable to their homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that my Ministry will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  strongly  promote  growth  and  development  of\r\n\r\nbroadband in Singapore and we expect the introduction of full\r\n\r\nand open competition in the telecommunications sector to help\r\n\r\nus achieve our objective of growing this important sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will ask my Minister of State to answer the other\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

At the back of the T-shirt, it was\r\n\r\nwritten  \"The answer is no\".  I was very curious of what  was\r\n\r\nthe  question in front. So, I overtook her and in  front,  it\r\n\r\nwas written, \"The answer is still no\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have listened to the various cuts put up by the\r\n\r\nvarious  Members with an open and receptive mind. I  want  to\r\n\r\nassure  them  that  I did not come in with any  pre-conceived\r\n\r\nideas.   Let  me  respond  to some  of  the  cuts  that  were\r\n\r\npresented by the Members here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Iswaran touched on the issue of a digital\r\n\r\ndivide.   59% of households in Singapore today have a  PC  at\r\n\r\nhome and 42% have access to Internet.  In fact, Singapore  is\r\n\r\none  of  the  most IT-intensive nations in the  world  today.\r\n\r\nHowever, we feel that the threat of a digital divide is still\r\n\r\nvery real.  The question is, why?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the penetration of home PCs, for the 1-to 3-room HDB flats, it is only 41%, compared to 78% for the\r\n\r\nHDB  Executive  flats and private housing. Among  the  people\r\n\r\nusing computers today, only 1 in 5 is more than 40 years old,\r\n\r\nand  1  in  20  is more than 50 years old. In  fact,  80%  of\r\n\r\ncomputer users today are those who are younger than 40  years\r\n\r\nold.   In  terms  of  educational qualifications,  among  the\r\n\r\ncomputer users again, only 1 in 6 is a primary school leaver,\r\n\r\n1 in 3 is a secondary school leaver.  60% of computer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusers  are  those with post-secondary and tertiary education.\r\n\r\nIn  short, we think that there is an early sign of a  digital\r\n\r\ndivide  along  the line of household income,  age  group  and\r\n\r\neducational qualifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under ICT 21 Masterplan, one of our aims is to dot.com\r\n\r\nthe  entire  people sector so that there will be  no  digital\r\n\r\ndivide  in  the  information society of  the  future.   Among\r\n\r\nhouseholds  without home PCs, according to  our  survey,  14%\r\n\r\ncited the high cost of a PC as a reason for not owning a  PC.\r\n\r\nFor  low-income households, we need to help make ownership of\r\n\r\nhome PCs more affordable to them.  However, what is even more\r\n\r\nimportant  is  to  help  more Singaporeans  to  discover  the\r\n\r\nusefulness  of  IT  and Internet and  to  learn  to  use  the\r\n\r\ntechnology.  This  is because among those households  without\r\n\r\nPCs  at home, 73% of them either do not see the need for  PCs\r\n\r\nor  do not know how to use a PC. Some of them also feel  that\r\n\r\nthey are too old to learn to use IT.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bridge this emerging digital divide, the Government\r\n\r\ncannot  do  it  alone. What we need is a  broad-based  people\r\n\r\nsector  driven  movement, reaching out to all  the  different\r\n\r\npopulation  segments in our society. We need to rely  on  the\r\n\r\njoint  efforts  of the Government, the labour  movement,  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community and the various volunteer and  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations,  so  as to overcome the  barriers  of  income,\r\n\r\nlanguage and mindset which are holding back some Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfrom embracing IT and Internet today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran made three suggestions yesterday. Firstly,\r\n\r\nto  draw on the People's Association in reaching out  to  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  users. Secondly, to use characters well-known  to\r\n\r\nolder Singaporeans, such as Liang Po Po and so on, as our  IT\r\n\r\nicons  and e-ambassadors.  And thirdly, to take the  path  of\r\n\r\nleast  resistance, such as games and entertainment, to induce\r\n\r\nfirst-time  computer users before they progress to  something\r\n\r\nmore  serious.  My response to Mr Iswaran's three suggestions\r\n\r\nis yes, yes and yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran suggested that we should step up effort to\r\n\r\npromote development of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternet  contents in Mandarin, Malay and Tamil.   Again,  my\r\n\r\nresponse  is yes. Up till now, Internet content is very  much\r\n\r\nUS-centric  and mainly in English.  With the  rapid  rise  in\r\n\r\nInternet  users based in Europe and in Asia, we are seeing  a\r\n\r\nclear  trend towards the development of regional contents  in\r\n\r\nregional  languages.  We can expect to see a rapid growth  of\r\n\r\nAsian portals in Asian languages from now on.  In fact,  this\r\n\r\nmorning, Media Corp Interactive and Popular Holdings launched\r\n\r\na  joint venture known as the Chinese 88.com. Their aim is to\r\n\r\nbecome  a  global  player  in the  Chinese  Internet  portal.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  our Malay and Tamil communities are promoting  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment and the use of Malay Internet and Tamil  Internet\r\n\r\nto  keep  up  with  the transition towards a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy and the information society.  The Government, through\r\n\r\nthe  IDA,  will work with these various industry players  and\r\n\r\ncivic  organisations, such as the Malay  and  Tamil  Internet\r\n\r\nSocieties,  and  provide them with the  necessary  assistance\r\n\r\nbecause the proliferation of non-English Internet is probably\r\n\r\nthe  best  way for us to attract more older Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  more  comfortable with their mother tongues rather  than\r\n\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, we will be providing assistance through\r\n\r\nthe   Local  Industry  Upgrading  Programme  (LIUP)  and  the\r\n\r\nInnovation  Development Scheme (IDS) to  help  companies  and\r\n\r\norganisations  that want to go into the development  of  non-English  contents  and portals.  At the same  time,  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  step up our training of Internet in  Malay  and\r\n\r\nTamil.  For example, at One Learning Place in Toa  Payoh,  so\r\n\r\nfar,  1,200 users have been trained to use Internet in  Malay\r\n\r\nand 257 were trained to use Internet in Tamil and we will  do\r\n\r\nmore of this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh suggested that we should do more to reach out to\r\n\r\nthe   homemakers.  I  agree  with  him.   In  fact,  we  have\r\n\r\nidentified homemakers as one of the five target groups.   The\r\n\r\nother  four  are  NS men, workers, senior  citizens  and  the\r\n\r\ndisabled. We will explore the use of TV as a medium\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  bring IT education to the homes, as suggested by Mr  Peh.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr Peh may be pleased to note that IDA is  running\r\n\r\nthe  One  Learning Place in Toa Payoh to provide training  on\r\n\r\nbroadband  Internet which is more fun and more exciting  than\r\n\r\nlearning Internet on TV.  For the 10 months, from May 1999 to\r\n\r\nFebruary  this  year, One Learning Place has reached  out  to\r\n\r\nmore  than  37,000 trainees. Among them, more  than  30%  are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are more than 40 years, including  608  of\r\n\r\nthem  who  are  more than 60 years old. Even  though  working\r\n\r\nadults  make  up  the  majority of the trainees  at  the  One\r\n\r\nLearning  Place,  we  did  have 2,970  homemakers  among  the\r\n\r\ntrainees  and  we hope that more will join the  class  as  we\r\n\r\nintensify  our efforts in reaching out to these  five  target\r\n\r\ngroups in the coming years.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang urged the Ministries to make their\r\n\r\nwebsites  as  interactive  as  possible  and  she  urged  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to exploit the full potential of Internet.   Again,\r\n\r\nmy  response is yes.  The public sector has been the  leading\r\n\r\nusers   of   IT   since   we  started   the   Civil   Service\r\n\r\nComputerisation   Programme  (CSCP)  in   1981.    The   CSCP\r\n\r\nspearheaded the use of PCs and database in Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nearly 80s, followed by data communication and electronic data\r\n\r\ninterchange  (EDI)  in  the  mid-80s,  and  followed  by  the\r\n\r\nintelligent  systems  and integrated office  systems  in  the\r\n\r\nearly 90s.  It has also been an early adopter of Internet and\r\n\r\nIntranet in the past few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next IT challenge for the civil service is to become\r\n\r\na  leading user of broadband Internet, wireless Internet  and\r\n\r\nInternet appliance.  With our firm foundation in IT built  up\r\n\r\nover  the  past 20 years, we should aspire to  be  among  the\r\n\r\nfirst  nations  in the world, if not the first,  to  offer  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  e-Government services for the  convenience  of\r\n\r\nthe  public.  We hope the day will come when members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  can have access to Government services in a triple  A\r\n\r\nmanner, meaning any time, anywhere, using any device,  be  it\r\n\r\nthe PC, Notebook, Palmtop, cellular handphone and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, but not least, we should not forget the\r\n\r\nsignificant role played by the labour movement.  In fact, the\r\n\r\nNTUC  is  today  the  largest provider of  IT  education  and\r\n\r\ntraining  in  Singapore, training more than 20,000  rank-and-file  workers in IT every year.  It will continue to  have  a\r\n\r\nmajor  role to play under the ICT 21.  We believe that it  is\r\n\r\nthrough such concerted efforts of the Government, the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement, the business community and grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nthat  we  are hopeful that many Singaporeans will embrace  IT\r\n\r\nand cross over to the right side of the digital divide in the\r\n\r\ncoming years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now move on to respond to the cut proposed\r\n\r\nby Mr Low Thia Khiang regarding IT security in the Government\r\n\r\nsector.  I agree with Mr Low that, as we intensify the use of\r\n\r\nIT  in  the  Government sector, IT security will become  even\r\n\r\nmore important, because it is important that we safeguard the\r\n\r\nreliability  and the security of the system, as well  as  the\r\n\r\ninformation maintained in this system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked three questions. Firstly, whether we have\r\n\r\nIT  standards in place for the Government sector.  The answer\r\n\r\nis  yes.  In fact, since July 1996, the former NCB, which  is\r\n\r\nIDA  today,  formulated a comprehensive set  of  IT  security\r\n\r\nstandards.   In  the  formulation  of  these  standards,   we\r\n\r\nbenchmarked ourselves with best practice all over  the  world\r\n\r\nand we even have a foreign expert to advise us.  Today, there\r\n\r\nis  a comprehensive set of IT security standards in place for\r\n\r\nthe  public  sector.  It covers all areas of security,  right\r\n\r\nfrom  IT  security  policy  to  various  specific  guidelines\r\n\r\nregarding  firewall and even disaster recovery, meaning  that\r\n\r\nif  something were to happen to our data centre, we  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to recover and relaunch the whole system within a  very\r\n\r\nshort period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low's second question is: are the guidelines secure\r\n\r\nenough to prevent illegal access?  The answer is yes and  no.\r\n\r\nThe  answer is yes because the guidelines, based on  what  we\r\n\r\nknow today, in terms of the technique for illegal access, are\r\n\r\nsufficient  to  prevent illegal access, at  least  to  detect\r\n\r\nthem.   But we must be mindful that every day there could  be\r\n\r\nsomeone\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndreaming of new ways of making an illegal access.  Basically,\r\n\r\nthe  risk  is always there.  Our challenge is to continue  to\r\n\r\nupdate  our  security standards to make sure that the  system\r\n\r\nwill be as secure as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mr Low wants to know who is responsible to\r\n\r\nensure  that the security guidelines will be implemented  and\r\n\r\nfollowed  in the civil service.  The direct agency that  must\r\n\r\nbe held responsible for the implementation of these standards\r\n\r\nmust  be  the  respective Ministries, because the information\r\n\r\nand  the  data  are owned by the respective Ministries.   The\r\n\r\nMinistries will therefore have direct responsibility to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that the security standards are being implemented,  and\r\n\r\nyet  at  the  same  time, we have in place  a  system  to  do\r\n\r\nauditing.  For example, every year, the Auditor-General  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  programme to audit the various Ministries.   At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, the IT audit team from IDA  goes round  to  audit\r\n\r\nthe Ministries, and they complement the effort of the Auditor-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the cut by Dr Teo Ho Pin who\r\n\r\nasked  two  questions.   Firstly, he  asked  whether  we  can\r\n\r\ninstall  outgoing mail boxes in all residential blocks.   The\r\n\r\nanswer is no.  The reason is because SingPost did a study and\r\n\r\nthey  came  to  the conclusion that if they were  to  put  an\r\n\r\noutgoing  mail  box in every residential block,  firstly,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be very labour intensive, meaning that they would  have\r\n\r\nto  employ more postmen to do the job.  Secondly, what is  of\r\n\r\neven  greater  concern to SingPost is that it  will  actually\r\n\r\nslow  down  the delivery time for local mail.  Because  right\r\n\r\nnow  under  the IDA guidelines, SingPost will have to  ensure\r\n\r\n95%  next day delivery for mails outside the CBD.  For  mails\r\n\r\nwithin the CBD, the standard is 98%.  And their assessment is\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  were  to put outgoing  mail  boxes  in  every\r\n\r\nresidential block, it will actually lengthen the process  and\r\n\r\ndelay the delivery of mail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question Dr Teo asked was whether we can\r\n\r\nrelocate  the  mail boxes along the roads  so  as  to  reduce\r\n\r\ntraffic congestion or provide parking bays for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  mail boxes.  Sir, the answer is yes.  IDA will continue\r\n\r\nto  work  with  SingPost  and the  LTA  to  minimise  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion and relocate the post boxes to population centres,\r\n\r\nsuch  as MRT stations, community clubs, bus interchanges  and\r\n\r\nselective petrol stations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, since the NTUC has committed to\r\n\r\nsupport and fund the training of all its 10,000 union leaders\r\n\r\nfor  basic IT and Internet, I would like to ask the  Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  whether  his  Ministry can  request  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation to do the same for all the grassroots leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> I think this is a very good suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe IDA will take it up with the People's Association and see\r\n\r\nhow we can implement a similar programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State what\r\n\r\nmeasures  have  been  taken by the Ministry  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nresidents can post mails conveniently?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, under the licence issued by the\r\n\r\nIDA  to  SingPost, there is a requirement  in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nlocation  of the mail boxes.  For example, in the  population\r\n\r\ncentres,  for  HDB estates that are more dense, the  distance\r\n\r\nbetween  any two outgoing mail boxes cannot be more than  500\r\n\r\nmetres.   For  the medium density blocks, it is  750  metres.\r\n\r\nFor  the low density blocks, it is 1 km.  Within the business\r\n\r\ndistrict, it is 250 metres.  In that sense, we make sure that\r\n\r\nour  residents do not have to walk too far in order  to  have\r\n\r\naccess to a mail box.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister, the\r\n\r\nMinister of State and the Parliamentary Secretary for all the\r\n\r\nanswers and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2).

If we have such a scheme, it\r\n\r\nwill  be a stabilising effect on COE prices.  I will give  an\r\n\r\nexample.  If the strike price is $30,000, one third  of  that\r\n\r\nis  $10,000.   And  anyone  bidding  above  $40,000  will  be\r\n\r\ndisqualified for that particular round, but his name  can  go\r\n\r\nover  to  the  next  or  following bid.   This  will  have  a\r\n\r\nstabilising  effect.  Instead of the upward push  of  prices,\r\n\r\nthis  cap would keep prices fairly stable, and not a  runaway\r\n\r\nprice like the $100,000 COE price that we had some time back.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are 30 seconds left, Mr Yeo.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> I think I should answer the Member.\r\n\r\nThe  studies  by LTA show that the successful  bids  actually\r\n\r\ncluster very closely to the lowest successful bid.  Using the\r\n\r\nexample of $30,000, actually most of the successful bids  are\r\n\r\nwithin  that $10,000 band that the Member was talking  about.\r\n\r\nThis is the vast majority.

It is a new hardware that we are all  very\r\n\r\npleased  and  proud of.  Thanks to you, Sir, as Speaker,  and\r\n\r\nall  those  who  have  been  involved  in  this  development.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I think that it is an opportune time to review  the\r\n\r\nsoftware  -  the Standing Orders and other related matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on a few points. First, the\r\n\r\nsitting times.  The sitting time of this House should perhaps\r\n\r\nbe  extended from the present time in the Standing Orders  of\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm to, say, 6.30 pm. The reason is that in the last\r\n\r\n81/2 years or so that I have been in this House, I have seen,\r\n\r\nalmost  at every sitting day, the Leader of the House had  to\r\n\r\nstand up and ask for an extension.  I think it is not fair to\r\n\r\nimpose  it  on him, and I think that we should extend  it  to\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm. If we finish early, he can stand up occasionally to\r\n\r\nsay, \"Let us adjourn.\"  That will be a better arrangement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the notice for Oral Questions. Presently, we\r\n\r\nneed  to give seven days' notice, and I would like to propose\r\n\r\nthat  with all these Internet speeches being made, we  should\r\n\r\nmove  to  a  more Internet time of maybe two or  three  days'\r\n\r\nnotice.   I know that some countries like the UK has  got  10\r\n\r\ndays' notice.  In the US, they hardly give any notice.   They\r\n\r\ngo  through  the committees.  There are various models.   For\r\n\r\nevery  country that we can find to say it is seven  or  eight\r\n\r\ndays,  we  can find countries, which like Uganda, have  three\r\n\r\ndays' notice.  So there is no right or wrong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmodel, but let us look at what is suitable for us.  This will\r\n\r\nmake  us more relevant and not dated in putting our Questions\r\n\r\nforward.   When  the  Straits Times  has  come  out  with  an\r\n\r\narticle, we have to wait seven days to ask the same Question,\r\n\r\nwhich does not really look right and current.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the civil servants and, to some extent, the\r\n\r\nFrontbench have to work a little bit harder if it is  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  days'  notice,  but I think it is  worth  it  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  all  Singaporeans who want to  get  the  updated\r\n\r\nposition of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point on Question Time is that we only have\r\n\r\none  hour for Question Time.  We have so many Questions.   In\r\n\r\nthe past, many Questions cannot be answered.  Something could\r\n\r\nbe  done, occasionally for  the Speaker or the Leader of  the\r\n\r\nHouse to decide that we  extend Question Time by another half\r\n\r\nan  hour to clear most of the Questions, and this can be done\r\n\r\nwith the discretion of the two gentlemen of the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards time limit for Backbenchers, you may be\r\n\r\nvery,  very  happy, Sir. At present, we allow 30 minutes  for\r\n\r\nspeeches  by Backbenchers.  I would like to propose maybe  we\r\n\r\ncut  it down to 15 or 20 minutes, simply because some  of  us\r\n\r\nhere  are  very  tired of hearing old gramophone  records  of\r\n\r\nspeeches  and  points made by some persons on such  topic  as\r\n\r\nlack  of  democracy in Singapore or lack of rule  of  law  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and so on.  Sir, certainly, we do not want to  put\r\n\r\nup with this.  I do not know whether Dr Vasoo agrees with me.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Certainly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Certainly. I want to move on to the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  Supply.  With many substantive  issues  to  be\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in  this  House  and the  number  of  Budget  cuts\r\n\r\nincreasing by the year and records being broken every year, I\r\n\r\nwould like to propose something practised by Westminster, ie,\r\n\r\nto  divide  the House into at least two Committees.   If  you\r\n\r\nlook at the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget  book on page 11, the financial expenditure is divided\r\n\r\nby   various  sectors.  We  have  got  security,  social  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  services, economic and infrastructural development\r\n\r\nand  general services.  The first two categories  are  really\r\n\r\nmore  for Defence and Home Affairs, Civil Defence, Education,\r\n\r\nHealth,  MCD  and  Sports,  MITA,  Environment,  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nInfrastructural development will include many of the business\r\n\r\nareas:  National Development, MCIT and so on.  We can  divide\r\n\r\nthe House into two and find a way to organise the MPs, either\r\n\r\nthey sit in one group or the other, or use our professors  in\r\n\r\nthe  University to find out how they schedule  their  student\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  where  they  go  through  various  modules   and\r\n\r\ncombinations.    I  know there are expert  systems  that  are\r\n\r\navailable for universities to use, and we can use  it  for  a\r\n\r\nfew days, I am sure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sinnakaruppan, can I ask you to allow\r\n\r\ntime for the Minister to reply?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Can I just be allowed two minutes\r\n\r\nmore, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I would like to propose that we\r\n\r\nlook  at  this  Committee model so that we can be  much  more\r\n\r\nefficient and at the same time give more time for speakers to\r\n\r\nput their points forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is on the $100 cuts. Mr Chiam has put\r\n\r\nin  many  $10  cuts.  Maybe he is following  the  rules  very\r\n\r\ncorrectly, but maybe he is just putting in his name  so  that\r\n\r\nhis name appears in many places and not be given a chance  to\r\n\r\nspeak because most MPs now put $100 cut.  Maybe we should get\r\n\r\naway with that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point is, I do not want to say anything\r\n\r\nabout  the Speaker's title because although he does not speak\r\n\r\nmuch  here,  the  Speaker is a distinguished  title  that  we\r\n\r\nshould still keep it.  It is an honorary title.  But for  the\r\n\r\nClerk of Parliament, in today's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontext  in  Singapore, (Mr P O Ram is about to  retire  from\r\n\r\ncivil  service)  if  we try to get younger  people  to  come,\r\n\r\nnobody  would  want  to  be the Clerk of  Parliament  because\r\n\r\neverybody thinks that it is a clerk's job.  P. O.  Ram  is  a\r\n\r\nsenior  civil  servant.  Many younger people will  not  come.\r\n\r\nEven an insurance agent is called an insurance consultant.  I\r\n\r\nthink we should look at all these points and perhaps call for\r\n\r\na  review  of  our  Standing Orders by  our  Standing  Orders\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> I thank the\r\n\r\nMember  for making this amendment.  Since the Speaker  cannot\r\n\r\nspeak, I will speak on his behalf and I hope he will not  cut\r\n\r\nme off at 4.05 pm.  I think we follow what some people do and\r\n\r\nwe  also  do new things on our own. I always have  a  dictum.\r\n\r\nWe  always look at what we do all the time, review them  and,\r\n\r\nif  it  is necessary to change, we will change.  But  I  also\r\n\r\nbelieve sometimes that when it ain't broke, do not fix it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few points that the Member raised. For\r\n\r\nexample, the extension of Question Time by more than half  an\r\n\r\nhour.   I  have looked up the other Parliaments and  I  found\r\n\r\nthat practically all of them have one hour or less.  In fact,\r\n\r\nin  some cases, even just 30 minutes.  In the case of Canada,\r\n\r\na  question cannot even be asked in more than 35 seconds  and\r\n\r\nan  answer cannot be given in more than 35 seconds.  I do not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  you want to get to that stage.   For  Question\r\n\r\nTime,  I  have some sympathy but for now, until we relook  at\r\n\r\nthe Standing Orders again, we leave it well and good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point about reducing the notice period from seven\r\n\r\ndays  to two days, I think two days would not be fair  enough\r\n\r\nfor  a  proper  answer to be given, unless he just  wants  an\r\n\r\nanswer  that says \"The Ministry will look into it.\"  That  we\r\n\r\ncan  give it to him perhaps with one day's notice or  on  the\r\n\r\nspot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exempting the Standing Orders every time we need to go\r\n\r\nbeyond  4.30 pm is not a problem at all.  It is a very simple\r\n\r\nthing.  I will stick to that because, if need be,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  will move a motion.  By his suggestion, I still have  got\r\n\r\nto come up and adjourn earlier.  So it makes no difference to\r\n\r\nme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time limit of speeches of Members to 20 minutes is a\r\n\r\ngood  point to consider.  At the right time, we may  consider\r\n\r\nthat.   But some may not totally agree with him because  some\r\n\r\nmay prefer a longer time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Committee of Supply dividing into two different\r\n\r\nCommittees,  I  think  all of us  want  to  be  in  the  same\r\n\r\ncommittee.   I  think it is very difficult  to  say  that  my\r\n\r\ninterest  is only in this and not in the others because  some\r\n\r\nof   our   interests  may  cross.   If  you   look   at   one\r\n\r\nclassification,  \"Economic and Infrastructural  Development\",\r\n\r\nMinistry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Manpower,  are\r\n\r\nvery different from public housing under Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.   So they are totally unrelated.  The  Ministers\r\n\r\nhave  a responsibility for their own portfolios and we should\r\n\r\nleave  it  to  them to decide how to answer  those  questions\r\n\r\ninstead of putting them into different Committees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the title, I think the Clerk will not appreciate\r\n\r\nchanging  the  title.   I do not know his  sentiments.   This\r\n\r\ntitle  has  been in existence for more than 600  years.   The\r\n\r\nfirst  recorded term of \"Clerk\" was in 1363, 637  years  ago.\r\n\r\nFortunately,  other Members said that the  Speaker  does  not\r\n\r\nneed  to  change his name.  If we changed, I am sure you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   will take great offence because in  the  whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  no  official title is called the Speaker,  except\r\n\r\nyours.   If we call you \"President\" or \"Chairman\", there  are\r\n\r\nplenty around.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sinnakaruppan, seeing that I am quite\r\n\r\nhappy with the way things are, do you still insist on cutting\r\n\r\nmy  budget?

Since\r\n\r\nthen, the issue has abated, thanks in no small measure to our\r\n\r\nlaw  enforcement officers, the new immigration checkpoint and\r\n\r\nalso  of  course  the recent addition to our  fleet  of  fast\r\n\r\npatrol boats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the issue has abated, it is by no means\r\n\r\nover.   We  still  have substantial numbers trying  to  enter\r\n\r\nSingapore illegally and right now there must be thousands  in\r\n\r\nour  midst  even  as I speak today.  As long as  our  economy\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  grow  and some other countries  face  economic\r\n\r\nhardship,  this  problem will not go  away.   Without  proper\r\n\r\nidentification records, and sometimes taken advantage  of  by\r\n\r\nsome unscrupulous employers, it is inevitable that some of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  illegals  will  resort  to  crime.   Apprehending  the\r\n\r\nperpetrators  becomes  sometimes an impossible  task  when  a\r\n\r\ncrime is committed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like the Minister to give an update to this\r\n\r\nHouse  on  the  situation  of  the  illegal  immigrants   and\r\n\r\noverstayers.   We should continue to place high  priority  on\r\n\r\nmaking  sure  that  our  borders  are  sealed  against  those\r\n\r\nentering Singapore illegally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must wonder the extent of the problem. For every\r\n\r\nsuccessful  apprehension of smuggling of  illegal  immigrant,\r\n\r\nthere  must be a number who have got away scot free. We  read\r\n\r\nin  the  newspapers  that everyone who has  been  caught  has\r\n\r\nadmitted to doing it more than once.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides depending on the Home Team for enforcement, we\r\n\r\nmust  also  do  more  by  way of  public  education.   In  an\r\n\r\nurbanised  country  like Singapore,  there  must  be  several\r\n\r\ninstances  of  Singaporeans who are aware  or  suspicious  of\r\n\r\nforeigners   living  in  their  midst  who  may  be   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants, yet they do not come forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is shocking indeed to read a New Paper report\r\n\r\nof  4th March headlined \"120 workers in one flat\".  There was\r\n\r\na  6-room  flat  in Serangoon which housed some  120  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   The  report  highlighted  the  horrendous   living\r\n\r\nconditions  of  these 120 foreign workers and  it  took  five\r\n\r\nmonths   for   someone  to  alert  the  police   and   report\r\n\r\nanonymously.  Although not proven yet that there are  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  in  this  group, this is an ideal  situation  for\r\n\r\nharbouring illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\nSir, we must step up public education that illegal immigrants\r\n\r\nare  a  threat to our well-being and security and it is  also\r\n\r\nthe public's duty to be on the lookout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister consider further measures to encourage\r\n\r\nthe public to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore proactive in seeking out illegal immigrants?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, the Minister informed\r\n\r\nthe  House last year that the Home Team arrested about 23,000\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders in 1998, which was a 65% increase  over\r\n\r\nthe  14,000  arrested  in 1997.  This  increased  arrest,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  came at a time when the region's economies were  not\r\n\r\ndoing  well.   As such, it was logical to expect that  people\r\n\r\nfrom  the  not-so-well  developed countries  come  and  flock\r\n\r\nillegally  to countries that have weathered the crisis  well.\r\n\r\nSingapore was one of these countries.  However, the situation\r\n\r\nhas changed.  Singapore and the regional economies have begun\r\n\r\nto recover.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned that Singaporeans may now have the\r\n\r\nperception  that  we  no longer have an immigration  offender\r\n\r\nproblem.  I wonder whether the Minister can update us on  the\r\n\r\ncurrent immigration offender situation in Singapore.  I think\r\n\r\nwe cannot afford to be lax in our enforcement efforts against\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders. We are not out of the woods  yet  and\r\n\r\ncannot afford to let our guards down.  We should particularly\r\n\r\ntarget those who trade in illegal immigrants, smuggle them in\r\n\r\nor  who  are traffickers.  Perhaps we should see how  we  can\r\n\r\nincrease penalties to deter them from pursuing such trades.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nimmigration law in Singapore is very stringent.  It has to be\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the size of our country.  However,  due  to  the\r\n\r\nproblem  that  we  encounter with the  slowing  down  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  growth  and the importance of attracting  foreign\r\n\r\ntalents, we have accepted more immigrants in recent years  to\r\n\r\nfulfil   our  objective.   Otherwise  the  rigidity  of   the\r\n\r\nimmigration rule is still intact.  One such rule governs  the\r\n\r\nreturn  of  single parents and their offsprings.   The  rules\r\n\r\nstate  that the children of single parents, father or mother,\r\n\r\nwho  return  to Singapore cannot be automatically granted  PR\r\n\r\nunless  his  or  her single parents can prove that  they  are\r\n\r\ngainfully   employed.    However,  many   Singaporean   women\r\n\r\nespecially, who married\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforeigners and who failed in their marriage and having gained\r\n\r\nthe  custody of their children, find it difficult  to  obtain\r\n\r\nPRs for them because they may not be able to secure a job due\r\n\r\nto  educational level or many other reasons that are  out  of\r\n\r\ntheir control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dilemma faced by these single parents is that their\r\n\r\nties  have been severed by their former spouses and they have\r\n\r\nno alternative place to settle but back to Singapore where at\r\n\r\nleast  they  have  the  support of their immediate  families.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Ministry  should be more compassionate  in  the\r\n\r\nruling  towards  these cases as, first, the number  of  these\r\n\r\ncases  must be quite insignificant.  Secondly, at  least  the\r\n\r\nchild  has  cultural  and  social  ties  with  the  immediate\r\n\r\nfamilies.   Thirdly,  it  seems to  be  quite  hard  that  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  their  offspring  cannot  be  considered\r\n\r\nfavourably to be PR.  Worse still, in case something  happens\r\n\r\nto  them,  their  offspring cannot stay in  Singapore  to  be\r\n\r\nlooked  after  by their immediate families  but  have  to  be\r\n\r\nrepatriated  to the country where they are its citizen,  they\r\n\r\nwill  have no connection whatsoever by now and their  spouses\r\n\r\nmay  have  remarried or moved to other places and  cannot  be\r\n\r\nlocated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, this House has heard in\r\n\r\nthe past few days of debate many calls for civil servants  to\r\n\r\nbe  proactive, accountable and transparent.  I echo the  need\r\n\r\nfor  civil  servants to have all these attributes  and  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  focus on the Singapore Immigration and Registration\r\n\r\nDepartment today.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR plays a key role in regulating the number of people\r\n\r\nentering  and staying in Singapore.  It also has  a  role  to\r\n\r\nplay  in determining who should or should not be citizens  or\r\n\r\npermanent  residents.   It shares a responsibility  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower in relation to maids, foreign  workers\r\n\r\nand the like, who are on work passes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that many Members of this House are asked\r\n\r\nto help applicants to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  SIR.  Whether it be an application for long-term  social\r\n\r\npass,  dependant's pass, or the extension of such passes,  or\r\n\r\nthe  application  for permanent residence or citizenship,  we\r\n\r\nare  continually at a loss as to why a case is rejected or  a\r\n\r\ndecision postponed.  Usually there is a brief message  saying\r\n\r\nthat the application has been unsuccessful.  Within a day  of\r\n\r\nreceiving the letter, the unsuccessful applicant is  back  in\r\n\r\nthe  meet-the-people session asking the MP to  write  another\r\n\r\nletter.   Huge  amount  of paper work is  generated  by  this\r\n\r\nprocess,  let alone the man-hours spent in having  to  answer\r\n\r\nwhat must be a mountain of letters every week from Members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the applicants to all these various forms of passes\r\n\r\nare  continuously puzzled by the rejection.  They  inevitably\r\n\r\nhave  stories to tell - their neighbours or their  co-workers\r\n\r\nwere  successful on similar facts, and so on.  I should  like\r\n\r\nto  suggest  that SIR be more precise in their letters.   The\r\n\r\nbest,  of  course, is to give a reason or reasons  for  their\r\n\r\ndecision.   That  would  give  invaluable  guidance  to   the\r\n\r\napplicant and he or she would be informed as to how he or she\r\n\r\ncan  improve  their chances of getting the appropriate  pass.\r\n\r\nIf  the  policy  is somehow veiled in secrecy,  the  official\r\n\r\nletters  should  state  how long the  applicant  should  wait\r\n\r\nbefore  his  or her case gets reviewed again.  The  MP  could\r\n\r\nperhaps be separately informed about the problem in the case.\r\n\r\nBut  I  naturally hope that this would be more the  exception\r\n\r\nthan the rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans who are applying on behalf of\r\n\r\ntheir  spouses  or family members frequently come  frustrated\r\n\r\nand  angry  at  the seemingly mysterious rejection  of  their\r\n\r\napplications.   And they get even more frustrated  and  angry\r\n\r\nwhen the MP could not lift the veil of mystery.  I believe it\r\n\r\nis  time  that SIR must be clearer in their communication  of\r\n\r\ntheir decisions to those who are applying and their sponsors.\r\n\r\nVery  often these decisions affect the happiness or otherwise\r\n\r\nof  the families concerned.  At least they should be entitled\r\n\r\nto  know why their applications are turned down.  I hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister can elaborate on this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Singapore Police Force Public\r\n\r\nPerception Survey last year and a similar survey done by  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times should make us proud of the Home Team.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusions are similar: in the Straits Times\r\n\r\nsurvey,  some  99% of the Singaporeans found this  country  a\r\n\r\nsafe  place to live in; and the Police survey, 95.8%  of  the\r\n\r\nrespondents  rated the general security of  Singapore  to  be\r\n\r\ngood  or  excellent.  The public's perception  of  safety  in\r\n\r\nSingapore perhaps stems from the fact that Singapore has seen\r\n\r\na decline in crime rate over the past 10 years.  In 1999, the\r\n\r\nPolice had less than 3,500 cases recorded per month, compared\r\n\r\nto  an average of some 4,000 cases per month in 1998.  It  is\r\n\r\nheartening to see that almost all major categories of  crimes\r\n\r\nhave declined.  As a result, people feel safe walking through\r\n\r\na stretch of deserted road from the bus-stop to their homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the image of a safe and secure Singapore has done\r\n\r\nour  economy  much good.  Many investors see Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nplace  where  they can do business smoothly, efficiently  and\r\n\r\nsafely.   Thus,  it  is no surprise that many  multi-national\r\n\r\ncompanies see Singapore as an ideal business hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not however take the situation for granted.\r\n\r\nIf  the standard of our law enforcing agencies should go into\r\n\r\ndecline, there is no turning back the clock.  After years  of\r\n\r\nbeing  perceived as a law and order country, today, Japan  is\r\n\r\nplagued  by  a  series of scandals in the  police  force  and\r\n\r\npublic perception of the level of security has dropped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good public perception of the Police is a hard-earned\r\n\r\none.   To ensure that we maintain this high standard, we must\r\n\r\ncontinue  the  high  standard  of  training  and  reward  our\r\n\r\nofficers well.  In the area of training, we must also improve\r\n\r\nthe training of officers handling the public as only some 64%\r\n\r\nof  the  Straits Times survey rated the service of the Police\r\n\r\nto  be  good  or  very good.  It could be  that  poor  public\r\n\r\nrelations is the cause of this perception.  It\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  be  that  good crime busters may not be the best  public\r\n\r\nrelations   persons,  but  we  have  to  try.    Besides   an\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  training, we must also  improve  the  reward\r\n\r\nsystem so that acts of exemplary conduct be well rewarded and\r\n\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Minister can highlight to the House how we\r\n\r\ncan continue to keep our Home Team in tip-top shape.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\non  24th  January this year, the Lianhe Zaobao  shows  a  big\r\n\r\ncaption that public confidence in the Police in Singapore has\r\n\r\ndeclined.   It  gave me a shock.  Do not  tell  me  that  the\r\n\r\npublic  has lost its confidence in our Police Force. This  is\r\n\r\nnot  true.  This caption was very misleading.  If we had  not\r\n\r\ncarefully read the contents of the article, the readers would\r\n\r\neasily get the wrong impression.  Therefore, I feel that  the\r\n\r\nmedia  should  be more careful in dealing with this  type  of\r\n\r\nnews.   Because  public confidence in the Police  is  closely\r\n\r\nlinked  to  public order, law and discipline of our  country.\r\n\r\nSo  the  media  has the responsibility to avoid unnecessarily\r\n\r\nand wrongly tarnishing the image of the Police.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sub-caption of this news was that more members of\r\n\r\nthe  public  feel  that  the Police  has  been  effective  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining public order in Singapore.  But this was the main\r\n\r\nfinding  of the survey in 1999.  Actually, there is  a  great\r\n\r\ncontradiction between the two captions.  If more people  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  Police is effective in maintaining  public  order,\r\n\r\nthen  their  confidence in the Police should  be  increasing,\r\n\r\ninstead of declining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1999 Singapore Police Force Public Perception\r\n\r\nSurvey,  as compared to the survey in 1996, shows that  there\r\n\r\nare  more  people who feel that the perception of the  Police\r\n\r\nhas  improved.   More people feel that the  Police  has  been\r\n\r\neffective in maintaining public order and that the Police has\r\n\r\ngiven  them  adequate protection, and are more  professional.\r\n\r\nThey  are able to solve crime cases in a better manner.  They\r\n\r\nwill  do  their  best  to go after the  criminals,  quick  in\r\n\r\nresponse, and effectively enforcing traffic laws,  etc.   The\r\n\r\ngeneral overall\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpression  of this survey is that the vast majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople feel that public order in Singapore is very good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past three years, there have not been great\r\n\r\nchanges.  As we all know, in 1997 and 1998, many countries in\r\n\r\nthis  region suffered from the financial crisis and  many  of\r\n\r\nthem had great political and social unrest, and we could  not\r\n\r\nhelp  being affected, particularly when there were a  lot  of\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants coming here.  It cannot  be  denied  that\r\n\r\nthere were some cases where Police officers were charged with\r\n\r\ncorruption  and  they had tarnished the clean  image  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force.   But  the  fact that  the  Police  Force  has\r\n\r\neffectively discovered and dealt with these black sheep among\r\n\r\nthem  also  illustrates  that  the  Police  Force  itself  is\r\n\r\ndetermined to safeguard its noble image.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the maintenance of public order, the Police's\r\n\r\ndeterrent  effect is crucial.  The deterrent  effect  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice   Force,   to   a  great  extent,   depends   on   its\r\n\r\nprofessionalism and effectiveness in solving cases.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, it is like paddling a canoe against the current.  If\r\n\r\nyou  do not go ahead, you will go backwards.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nPolice should work harder to further improve itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the society getting more and more\r\n\r\nsophisticated, the Police has to face greater  challenges  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with the criminals and in the investigation  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  types  of  crimes.  The social public  order  cannot\r\n\r\ndepend  on the Police alone.  The public should also  play  a\r\n\r\nvery important role to cooperate with the Police.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nI will take this opportunity to urge members of the public to\r\n\r\nactively  participate in the Community  Safety  and  Security\r\n\r\nProgramme  launched by the Police Force, so as to  contribute\r\n\r\ntowards the overall social security.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, if I can take it where\r\n\r\nMr  Chng and Mr Goh have left.  It appears from time to  time\r\n\r\nthat there is a disjoint between the public perception of the\r\n\r\nPolice Force and the general crime situation on the one  hand\r\n\r\nand the actual state of affairs on the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the facts, the Police Force has come a\r\n\r\nlong way in terms of professionalism, in terms of the quality\r\n\r\nof  its manpower and in terms of the general crime situation.\r\n\r\nYet,  the Police Force comes in for an unfair criticism or  a\r\n\r\nbum rap, as some would say it from time to time.  Why is that\r\n\r\nso?  There appear to be several contributory factors. One  is\r\n\r\noccasional   media   reporting;   the   other   is   personal\r\n\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can elaborate, although the general statistics on\r\n\r\ncrime have been improving, occasional crime occurrences, such\r\n\r\nas  some recent ones in Bukit Batok, loom large in the public\r\n\r\npsyche  and  fundamentally affect their  sense  of  security.\r\n\r\nSecondly, personal experiences with the Police.  Although, in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  one might be pleased with the state of  affairs,  a\r\n\r\nparticular episode with an individual officer may  leave  one\r\n\r\nwith a different impression. And thirdly, a few bad apples in\r\n\r\nthe  Force may also give the entire Police Force an  unfairly\r\n\r\nbad  image.   These occasional episodes can affect  adversely\r\n\r\nthe general sense of security and therefore public perception\r\n\r\nof  the  Police  Force.   And this  may  also  hinder  public\r\n\r\ncooperation  with  the Police's efforts,  which  I  think  is\r\n\r\nfundamental for the success of the Police's efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what is being done\r\n\r\nto  maintain and enhance the Police Force's standing  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  eye.   The Police Force, like any other organisation,\r\n\r\npublic  or private, needs strong public relations because  it\r\n\r\nmust  do  a good job and it must be seen to be doing  a  good\r\n\r\njob.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I would like to know whether the\r\n\r\nMinistry  and  the  Police Force, in  particular,  has  a  PR\r\n\r\nprogramme  in general with the national level,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  and  sustain the public's confidence and  sense  of\r\n\r\nappreciation for the Police Force.  Second, whether there are\r\n\r\nspecific programmes that can be put in place in the aftermath\r\n\r\nof  particularly dramatic incidents, so that  people  in  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  can rest assured and their confidence  can  be\r\n\r\nrestored quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, third, what programmes there are at the individual level\r\n\r\nfor  particular officers to be trained in order to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe general public and also with grassroots leaders?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the recent spate of\r\n\r\nhigh  profile  prosecution  of  corrupt  officers  from   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Police Force, the Civil Defence and the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration Department (collectively called the \"Home  Team\")\r\n\r\nhas  caused  much  concern and dismay to  Singaporeans.   The\r\n\r\nprosecutions  would  appear  to  have  had  the   effect   of\r\n\r\nundermining  public confidence in the integrity of  the  Home\r\n\r\nTeam.  Needless to say, Singaporeans take great pride in  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  our  society is relatively free from  corruption.\r\n\r\nThe  fact  that these cases have now come out to light  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter of concern indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many Singaporeans who continue to express\r\n\r\nthese  concerns, even though a recent report  from  a  survey\r\n\r\ncommissioned by the Police Force and published in the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  revealed  that  most  Singaporeans  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Police Force is doing a good job  in  keeping  the\r\n\r\ncountry   safe   and   that  the  Police   are   respectable,\r\n\r\napproachable, well-trained, disciplined and capable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such reaction is only natural, as the public has rightly\r\n\r\ncome  to  expect the highest level of integrity  and  honesty\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people  whom  they have  placed  their  trust  and\r\n\r\nconfidence in to look after their safety and security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, even though their concern is natural, it is not\r\n\r\nthe  only way to react to the recent publicity.  On the other\r\n\r\nhand, the publicity may be seen from a different perspective.\r\n\r\nOne way of looking at this is that the prosecution of corrupt\r\n\r\nofficers shows that we do not cover up such cases.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  should take comfort in the knowledge  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  goes  all  out to prosecute  errant  officers  of\r\n\r\nwhatever  rank.   And  indeed, those tempted  to  follow  the\r\n\r\nfootsteps of the errant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficers  would  know that far from providing any  protection\r\n\r\nagainst  detection  and punishment,  the  Home  Team  and  in\r\n\r\nparticular the Police Force,  is ever more determined to keep\r\n\r\nits own house in order.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics given by the Straits Times as to the\r\n\r\nexact   number  of  errant  officers  who  were  caught   and\r\n\r\nprosecuted  in  recent  years  have  shown  a  rising  trend.\r\n\r\nStatistics,  however,  Sir, must be  read  in  context.   The\r\n\r\nfigures must be seen in the light of the total composition of\r\n\r\nthe  Home Team.  Compared to previous years, the Police Force\r\n\r\nis  now  7,500 strong.  If out of the 7,500 police  officers,\r\n\r\nonly 35 have been prosecuted as of September 1999, the figure\r\n\r\nseems  quite  minuscule indeed.  We must bear  in  mind  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  an overwhelming number of officers from  the  Home\r\n\r\nTeam  who  maintain  the  highest  standard  of  conduct  and\r\n\r\ndecorum.   To  pass poor judgment on the Home Team  would  be\r\n\r\nmanifestly  unfair to the others who have served the  country\r\n\r\nfaithfully.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question is whether those who were caught and\r\n\r\nprosecuted only represent the tip of the iceberg.  Sir, I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think so.  Since last year, we note that the police have\r\n\r\nput  in  place  a  series  of measures  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  of  the Home Team is maintained.   These  measures\r\n\r\ninclude   job   rotation,  zero  tolerance  for   corruption,\r\n\r\npsychological screening and emotional and financial help  for\r\n\r\npolice officers in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over and above such measures put in place by the Police\r\n\r\nForce,  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would consider it necessary to prescribe  heavier\r\n\r\npenalties  in  law for police officers who  have  broken  the\r\n\r\ntrust  of the public by engaging in corrupt practices.   What\r\n\r\nthis  means  is that the law specifies special  penalties  on\r\n\r\nsuch  officers as opposed to leaving it to the discretion  of\r\n\r\nthe  judge  as  a  matter  of  sentencing  policy.   This  is\r\n\r\nimportant as it sends a clear signal to members of the public\r\n\r\non the seriousness with which we treat such breaches.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, police officers are not ordinary civil servants.\r\n\r\nTogether with members of the Home Team, they are entrusted by\r\n\r\nthe members of the public to protect life and property and to\r\n\r\nuphold  the  law.  The Home Team has a very high and  onerous\r\n\r\nduty.   A breach of the trust that the public placed on  them\r\n\r\nis  very  serious  indeed.  Accordingly, the punishment  must\r\n\r\nalso  be considerably higher than the rest of society.   With\r\n\r\nmore  severe  penalties,  it would  perhaps  add  as  another\r\n\r\ndeterrent to discourage police officers from even thinking of\r\n\r\nstepping in the direction of errant ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the objective of the Community\r\n\r\nSafety   and  Security  Programme  (CSSP)  is  to   encourage\r\n\r\ncommunities  to take active responsibility in solving  safety\r\n\r\nand  security problems at the local level, supported  by  the\r\n\r\nHome  Team.   Sir, the approach in implementing the  CSSP  so\r\n\r\nfar  is  to mobilise the community through grassroots leaders\r\n\r\nin  the CDCs, CCCs, RCs and neighbourhood committees.   These\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders have been instrumental in crafting CSSP in\r\n\r\nreaching  out  to  the  residents  and  encouraging  them  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in their activities.  Although an integral  part\r\n\r\nof the community, schools have largely been operating outside\r\n\r\nthe CSSP framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a number of benefits for us to send the\r\n\r\nCSSP to the schools.  These are (1) the focus in dealing with\r\n\r\nsafety and security concerns.  Sir, different schools have  a\r\n\r\ndifferent safety and security profile.  The CSSP allows every\r\n\r\nschool to tailor-make measures to zero in on the most present\r\n\r\nsafety and security problems.  For example, some of the  CSSP\r\n\r\nactivities  may  include  the  refinements  to  the  school's\r\n\r\nconduct  of  fire drills, with the assistance  of  the  SCDF,\r\n\r\nimplementing  a  scheme to enrol students  in  policing  busy\r\n\r\nroads  and junctions leading to the schools, etc.  This  will\r\n\r\nensure  that  our  traffic safety rules are  observed  during\r\n\r\nschool  assembly  and  dismissal  hours.   (2)   Working  out\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  address  the issue of delinquency  in  school\r\n\r\nchildren loitering in our void decks.  The main point is that\r\n\r\nthere is a single point of contact for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools.   Schools  currently conduct  individual  Home  Team\r\n\r\ncontact,  individual Home Team department to seek  advice  in\r\n\r\nsystems,  in  areas, such as crime prevention,  fire  safety,\r\n\r\ndrug abuse, prison visits, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the CSSP framework in place, schools can work with\r\n\r\nthe  Home  Team on all safety and security issues  through  a\r\n\r\nsingle  point of contact represented by the Police.  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  arrangement  will  also help  to  reduce  inconvenience\r\n\r\nworkload of the schools.  It will also allow the Home Team to\r\n\r\nhave  a better understanding with the school's overall safety\r\n\r\nand  security  problem and thereby enable the  Home  Team  to\r\n\r\ncoordinate joint assistance programmes to effectively improve\r\n\r\nthe safety and security vision of the schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, inculcating community spirit. Through the\r\n\r\nCSSP,  the school can educate our students on the community's\r\n\r\nrole  in  resolving safety and security issues by  roping  in\r\n\r\nstudents  to  participate in the CSSP  activities.   Students\r\n\r\nlearn  the  concept of community self-help and they  need  to\r\n\r\ntake up responsibility to look after the community.  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis  timely  that we do more work and take some  comprehensive\r\n\r\nsteps  to  bring  the  schools to win the  CSSP.   Would  the\r\n\r\nMinister  highlight to the House what are the plans  in  this\r\n\r\narea?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, CSSP has been in force for some time\r\n\r\nnow.  I would like to ask the Minister what the progress  has\r\n\r\nbeen,  in  particular, what the response has  been  from  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots   organisations  who  have  been   approached   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the programme.  In particular, I would like to\r\n\r\nknow whether the Ministry adjudges the programme to have been\r\n\r\na  success so far and how it has measured the success of this\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as Mr Chng has highlighted, the question is\r\n\r\nwhether we can build on this platform and extend the CSSP  to\r\n\r\nother  organisations  or  other areas  of  concern,  and  the\r\n\r\nschools are a logical extension in this respect.  However, my\r\n\r\nconcern  is  also that, if a school participates  in  a  CSSP\r\n\r\nprogramme, does it risk\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattracting an audience that is involved because of a problem,\r\n\r\nor  that it is rife with a crime or criminal elements  rather\r\n\r\nthan  the  fact  that  it  is proactive  and  forthcoming  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in this activity.  So I would ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nexplain how such programmes, if they intend to be extended to\r\n\r\nthe  schools  and  other  agencies, will  be  done  and  what\r\n\r\ncriteria and perhaps, more importantly, how the right message\r\n\r\ncan  be communicated that this participation is proactive and\r\n\r\nnot because there are problems rife within the organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, with this general effort to involve the\r\n\r\ncommunity  in policing and in the maintenance and enhancement\r\n\r\nof  general security in our communities, the question that is\r\n\r\noften  asked is whether this augments or whether it  replaces\r\n\r\nor  is  a  substitute for activities by  the  Police  on  the\r\n\r\nground,  in particular, patrolling and the manning levels  at\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  police  posts,  etc.   So  I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  assurance that indeed, the CSSP is to  complement\r\n\r\nthe  existing police activity on the ground and that it  does\r\n\r\nnot lead to any scaling back of such activity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the speed in which\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore police officers solve cases is well  known  to\r\n\r\nall.  For example, they have done very well in arresting  the\r\n\r\nkidnappers, secret society members and robbers. This is  very\r\n\r\nheartening.   However, recently, I heard some  comments  from\r\n\r\nordinary  citizens in Singapore that when the police arrested\r\n\r\nthe  illegal  workers and  loansharks at the coffeeshops  and\r\n\r\nhawker centres, they could only arrest the \"tua pek kong\" but\r\n\r\nnot  the  \"heads\".  At first, I did not understand what  they\r\n\r\nmeant  by  tua  pek  kong.  Later on, I found  out  that  the\r\n\r\nordinary citizens were referring to the runners.  They cannot\r\n\r\nget hold of the syndicate leaders, but managed only to arrest\r\n\r\nthe runners who were really the scapegoats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that with the wisdom, experience and\r\n\r\nefficiency of the senior-ranking police officers,  they  need\r\n\r\njust to spend a little more time and effort.  And\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  would be able to catch hold of these syndicate  leaders\r\n\r\nand  not just these runners to be the scapegoats.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nif  our  policemen  can  only nab these  runners,  while  the\r\n\r\nsyndicate  leaders stay at the back and laugh at  the  police\r\n\r\nfor  their  incapability, it will be an insult to the  entire\r\n\r\npolice  force.   From what I know,  even after these  runners\r\n\r\nwere arrested and sent to prison, the gang would continue  to\r\n\r\ncollect the protection money, which could be as high as  $500\r\n\r\nper  month  from the hawkers.  But of course,  the  syndicate\r\n\r\nleaders  will  look after the runners and every  month,  they\r\n\r\nwill  pay money to family members of these runners to support\r\n\r\nthem.  What I am worried is that if the police is not able to\r\n\r\ncatch  hold  of the syndicate leaders, then we would  not  be\r\n\r\nable to eradicate these criminal activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, foreign workers\r\n\r\nand   domestic  maids  come  from  different  countries  with\r\n\r\ndifferent   language,  religious  and  cultural  backgrounds.\r\n\r\nAlthough  statistics  reveal that there are  cases  involving\r\n\r\nforeign  workers, it is fortunately not on an  upward  trend.\r\n\r\nBut  the  number  of cases involving foreign  domestic  maids\r\n\r\nseems to be going up and recently, in the media, we read  the\r\n\r\nreport  of  various  types of cases like rape,  outraging  of\r\n\r\nmodesty, abuse, theft, etc.  So the impression given to us is\r\n\r\nthat cases involving foreign domestic maids are on the upward\r\n\r\ntrend.  Perhaps, their cases may be more complicated than the\r\n\r\ncases  involving  our  local citizens and  the  investigating\r\n\r\nofficers will require some specialist skills for that.   Some\r\n\r\npeople  feel  that the police should have a special  unit  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with such cases and the new crime situation.

Let me deal with\r\n\r\na few of the cuts and then I will ask my Minister of State to\r\n\r\nanswer the others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the illegal immigrant situation,\r\n\r\nraised by Mr Chng Hng Kok and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin,  let me report to this House that in  1999,  the\r\n\r\nHome  Team  arrested about 17,000 immigration offenders.   By\r\n\r\n\"immigration  offenders\"  we  mean  illegal  immigrants   and\r\n\r\noverstayers,   people  who  have  overstayed  in   Singapore,\r\n\r\noverstayed  beyond the period stated in their  visit  passes.\r\n\r\nThis figure of 17,000 is actually a decrease of about 26%  of\r\n\r\nthe  1998's figure of 23,000.  But this figure is still  much\r\n\r\nhigher,   about  21%  higher  than  the  14,000   immigration\r\n\r\noffenders   arrested  in  1997.   The  immigration  offenders\r\n\r\narrested  in 1999 came from all over the region - Bangladesh,\r\n\r\nChina, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of illegal immigrants arrested in 1999, ie,\r\n\r\nthose  who  sneak  into Singapore either  by  car,  boat,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  means, was about 11,500.  This is  a  22%  decrease\r\n\r\nfrom  the 14,800 compared to 1998.  But it is still 51%  more\r\n\r\nthan  the 7,600 arrested in 1997 and I consider this  a  very\r\n\r\nunacceptably high figure.  As for the overstayers,  5,400  of\r\n\r\nthem were arrested in 1999 and this is also a decrease of 35%\r\n\r\nfrom  the  8,300 overstayers arrested in 1998 and  a  further\r\n\r\ndecrease of 14% from the 1997's figure of 6,300.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure that the immigration offender problem\r\n\r\nremains  in  check, the Home Team has taken  a  multi-pronged\r\n\r\napproach  to  deal  with this problem  comprehensively.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  we  have  enhanced our  border  control.   We  have\r\n\r\ncontinued  with  intensive enforcement  efforts  against  the\r\n\r\ntraffickers,  the  employers  as  well  as  the   harbourers.\r\n\r\nPolice  and  Immigration have also conducted raids  in  areas\r\n\r\nwhere  immigration offenders are likely to gather to work  or\r\n\r\nlive.  Let me elaborate on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past year, the Police and the Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration   and  Registration  raided  various  immigration\r\n\r\noffender  haunts,  including construction sites,  workplaces,\r\n\r\nforested  areas  and known congregation  areas.   The  Police\r\n\r\nconducted  15  major island-wide operations throughout  1999,\r\n\r\nresulting in the arrest of 1,400 illegal immigrants  and  185\r\n\r\noverstayers.  In addition, 17 operations were conducted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  forested areas, with 195 illegal immigrants  and  27\r\n\r\noverstayers arrested.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police also targeted the employers of immigration\r\n\r\noffenders  and the harbourers at their residential  premises,\r\n\r\nsuch as our HDB flats and also in private estates.  Since  we\r\n\r\nstepped  up  enforcement  in  early  1998,  it  is  now  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to find congregations of immigration offenders  at\r\n\r\nany particular location. The Police has therefore widened its\r\n\r\nnet  to  include  entertainment outlets in the  crackdown  on\r\n\r\nimmigration offenders. For example, in October last year, 100\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders  were arrested  in  a  discotheque  in\r\n\r\nOrchard Road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Police Coast Guard has stepped up both sea and\r\n\r\nshore  patrols to detect those who attempt to enter Singapore\r\n\r\nillegally  by  sea.   The  Police Coast  Guard  also  deploys\r\n\r\nmonitoring  posts  equipped with surveillance  equipment  and\r\n\r\nsystems  at  strategic  locations  to  detect  these  illegal\r\n\r\nlandings.  The  Police  Coast Guard's enhanced  presence  has\r\n\r\nthwarted  many illegal immigration attempts.   In  1999,  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Coast Guard foiled 52 attempts and arrested close  to\r\n\r\n240  illegal immigrants.  To stay on top in its fight against\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders and the smugglers,  the  Police  Coast\r\n\r\nGuard recently added 20 high speed patrol boats equipped with\r\n\r\nthe  latest surveillance and digital communication  equipment\r\n\r\nand   six   highly  manouverable  speedboats  or  interceptor\r\n\r\nspeedboats  to its fleet.  Illegal immigrants and traffickers\r\n\r\nwho try to sneak in by sea will therefore be up against these\r\n\r\nhigh performance boats.  The Police Coast Guard will continue\r\n\r\nto  upgrade  its  fleet  to ensure that  it  is  sufficiently\r\n\r\nequipped to handle the threats and the challenges it faces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July last year, the new Woodlands Checkpoint or land\r\n\r\ncheckpoint  came  into  operation.   To  address  Mr   Chng's\r\n\r\nquestion,  the  facilities at this new  Woodlands  Checkpoint\r\n\r\nhave enabled the immigration to conduct more stringent checks\r\n\r\non  the  people  who  come in, to prevent illegal  entry  and\r\n\r\ndeparture through the land\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncheckpoints,   without  adversely  affecting  traffic   flow,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  it  starts to check everybody, then  I  am  sure\r\n\r\npeople  will complain that there are long queues of  vehicles\r\n\r\nand long lines of people queuing at our immigration counters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police and the immigration also intensified the\r\n\r\nintelligence gathering to curb the trafficking of immigration\r\n\r\noffenders through the land checkpoints and these efforts have\r\n\r\nyielded  positive results. For example, 60 illegal  immigrant\r\n\r\ntraffickers  were arrested and 52 vehicles  seized  in  1999,\r\n\r\ncompared  to  only 42 illegal immigrant traffickers  arrested\r\n\r\nand  23  vehicles  seized in the year 1998.   Many  of  these\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants who were arrested were  trying  to  enter\r\n\r\nSingapore or leave Singapore by concealing themselves in  the\r\n\r\ncar  boots  or  in  special compartments of  travel  coaches,\r\n\r\nlorries  or  bus  kilangs.  The media have  highlighted  some\r\n\r\nenforcement successes.  In a widely reported case last  year,\r\n\r\nSIR  arrested 35 illegal immigrants who tried to  sneak  into\r\n\r\nSingapore  on the 30th of July, which was the very  last  day\r\n\r\nwhen our old checkpoint was in operation. They were all in  a\r\n\r\nlorry  under  the canvas sheet and mattresses.   This  tragic\r\n\r\ncase  resulted  in  four of the illegal immigrants  dying  of\r\n\r\nsuffocation. This case clearly shows the ruthless  nature  of\r\n\r\nthe traffickers of these immigration offenders. They will  go\r\n\r\nto  no end just to earn a quick dollar without caring for the\r\n\r\nsafety of the people in the vehicle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police and immigration are also now focusing on\r\n\r\ncrippling the syndicates that are responsible for trafficking\r\n\r\nthese immigration offenders and giving these offenders forged\r\n\r\ndocuments. With the stringent checks in place, the syndicates\r\n\r\nhave  been  finding new ways to send these illegal immigrants\r\n\r\nthrough  the land checkpoints.  From using lorries and  buses\r\n\r\nor  hiding in car boots, the syndicates are now resorting  to\r\n\r\nusing  special compartments in the vehicles or ferrying these\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants  by car or lorry to  somewhere  near  the\r\n\r\ncheckpoint  and  then ask these illegal  immigrants  to  find\r\n\r\ntheir own way into Singapore, or out of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch action by the syndicates is a sign of their desperation,\r\n\r\nin  view  of  the  stringent checks and  enforcement  by  the\r\n\r\nauthorities.  The evolving nature of the problem  means  that\r\n\r\nthe  Home Team has to be alert and stay on top of the problem\r\n\r\nand  be  responsive to the new methods of operation of  these\r\n\r\nsyndicates.   We will seek deterrent sentences against  these\r\n\r\nsyndicate members who are arrested.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the responsibility for tackling the immigration\r\n\r\noffender problem does not just lie with the Home Team  alone.\r\n\r\nThe  public, too, has a role to play. Singaporeans should not\r\n\r\ncreate  the  demand  for immigration offenders  by  employing\r\n\r\nthem.    That   is   very  important.   And  neither   should\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  harbour  them by renting  out  their  premises,\r\n\r\nflats,  private apartments or houses to them.  In  1999,  388\r\n\r\nemployers were arrested, compared to 270 arrested in 1998 for\r\n\r\nhiring these immigration offenders.  306 harbourers were also\r\n\r\narrested  last year compared to 166 in 1998. All  these  were\r\n\r\nbecause of stepped-up enforcement by Police and immigration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home-owners with premises to let out should be more\r\n\r\ncareful  when  selecting their prospective  tenants,  because\r\n\r\nmany  of  these home-owners claimed that they did  not  check\r\n\r\nthis or that, or they simply checked the copy without looking\r\n\r\nat  the  original copy.  What they should do is to check  the\r\n\r\nprospective  tenants' original copy of  the  immigration  and\r\n\r\nwork  passes  and  then cross-check to  make  sure  that  the\r\n\r\nparticulars  on the passports tally with those  of  the  work\r\n\r\npasses.  In addition, where the names of the employers appear\r\n\r\non  the  work passes, then the home-owners should also  check\r\n\r\nwith the employers to verify that the prospective tenants are\r\n\r\nindeed  employed by these employers. If not, they  will  find\r\n\r\nthemselves in great difficulty explaining to the  court.   If\r\n\r\nthe  home-owners are in doubt of the genuineness of the  pass\r\n\r\nor  about  the status of the person, or even about  his  work\r\n\r\nstatus, then, they should contact the immigration authorities\r\n\r\nduring  office  hours  or  check  with  the  information  and\r\n\r\nservices  counters  of  the  Work Permit  Department  of  the\r\n\r\nManpower Ministry to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nverify the genuineness or the authenticity of these passes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we amended the law, all work permit holders or\r\n\r\nforeign  workers must carry their work permits with them  all\r\n\r\nthe  time. So there is no reason why foreign worker would not\r\n\r\nbe able to produce the original copy of their work permits on\r\n\r\ndemand.   Landlords should be suspicious if their prospective\r\n\r\ntenants  say that their employer kept the original  and  that\r\n\r\nthey  have only a photocopy, or that their passports are with\r\n\r\nthe  employer  and  they  have only a  photocopy.  When  they\r\n\r\nreceive  such  papers,  they should question  and  insist  on\r\n\r\nseeing  the original copies.  A home-owner may lose  his  HDB\r\n\r\nflat,  if he or his spouse or any authorised occupier of  the\r\n\r\nflat  has been convicted of harbouring immigration offenders.\r\n\r\n14  such  errant owners had their flats re-possessed  between\r\n\r\n1st January 1995 and 31st October 1999.  So be careful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fundamental point I wish to make here is that, like\r\n\r\nour  Members who have suggested, Singaporeans should take  an\r\n\r\ninterest  in  their own safety and security  and  the  public\r\n\r\nshould  report any suspected immigration offender as well  as\r\n\r\nharbourers and employers of such immigration offenders.  I am\r\n\r\ntold by the Director of Singapore Immigration that there  was\r\n\r\na  recent instance where a member of the public came  forward\r\n\r\nto report a suspected immigration offender who had produced a\r\n\r\nforged  blue identity card. The member of the public saw  the\r\n\r\nforged blue identity card and he suspected that something was\r\n\r\nnot  quite right.  He called the SIR to look at that identity\r\n\r\ncard  and SIR confirmed that that foreigner was, in fact,  an\r\n\r\nimmigration  offender.   Such public spiritedness  is  to  be\r\n\r\nencouraged.  This  will further deter  anyone  who  wants  to\r\n\r\nemploy or harbour such immigration offenders and in the  end,\r\n\r\nthese immigration offenders will find that they have no place\r\n\r\nto live, work or hide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the case brought up by Mr Chng of the 120 persons\r\n\r\nfound  living in a boarding house in Serangoon  Road,  I  had\r\n\r\nfollowed  up and checked it out, and I was told that  all  of\r\n\r\nthem are here with work passes. So\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have  work permits.  But the owner of the property  has\r\n\r\nmisused his property.  He did not have the permission of  the\r\n\r\nproper  authority and I believe URA or BCA has taken  action,\r\n\r\nand so has the Civil Defence Force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me also talk about the Immigration Act which\r\n\r\ndeals  with  immigration  offenders.  We  have  reviewed  the\r\n\r\nImmigration Act quite a few times already to make  sure  that\r\n\r\nit  is  effective in dealing with this problem  and  now  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   is   reviewing  the  Immigration  Act   based   on\r\n\r\noperational   experience  to  ensure  that  this   piece   of\r\n\r\nlegislation  continues to remain effective.  For example,  we\r\n\r\nare considering introducing new provisions to ensure that the\r\n\r\nhousing   agents  also  play  their  part  in   curbing   the\r\n\r\nimmigration  offender  problem. To deter  the  harbouring  of\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders, the current Immigration  Act  imposes\r\n\r\ndue diligence on the person letting out the accommodation  to\r\n\r\ncheck  and  make  sure that the prospective tenants  are  not\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders.  But my Ministry  will  now  consider\r\n\r\nextending  this  legal requirement for due diligence  by  the\r\n\r\nlandlords to those who act as facilitators or middlemen in  a\r\n\r\ntransaction to rent out the premises as well.  But  this  new\r\n\r\nprovision  will  not  absolve or reduce the  home-owners  and\r\n\r\nlandlords to conduct due diligence checks as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of my colleagues spoke on the public perception\r\n\r\nof  the  police  force  and  Mr Goh Choon  Kang  specifically\r\n\r\nreferred to the headline in the press report in Lianhe Zaobao\r\n\r\nand  he  also  explained  that  the  second  headline  better\r\n\r\nexplains the public perception of the Police Force.   Let  me\r\n\r\nsay  that  I  am the first person to be concerned  about  the\r\n\r\npublic  perception of the Police Force because, if the public\r\n\r\nhas  a  poor impression of the police force, I think it  will\r\n\r\nmake  it  very  difficult for the Police to operate  in  this\r\n\r\nenvironment. They cannot recruit people to join them  because\r\n\r\nit is a lousy outfit or people think it is a lousy outfit and\r\n\r\nthey  cannot do their job well because the public  would  not\r\n\r\ncooperate with it.  But we must look at the problem  that  is\r\n\r\ncurrently   highlighted  or  reported   in   the   press   in\r\n\r\nperspective, in the total context of the Police Force.  From\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  you  read in the papers and what you read  about  other\r\n\r\ncountries  like in the United States, whether it  is  in  New\r\n\r\nYork or Los Angeles, or whether it is in Japan or in Britain,\r\n\r\nI  think  the  problems  we face pale in  significance.   But\r\n\r\nstill,  I am concerned because any black sheep that  we  have\r\n\r\nwill  cast a black mark on the whole force and will  make  it\r\n\r\ndifficult for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the survey mentioned by Mr Goh Choon Kang\r\n\r\nfirst.  Generally, the survey has been positive and  many  of\r\n\r\nthe  positive points have been highlighted.  This survey  was\r\n\r\ndone by a private survey agency, Forbes Research, and it  was\r\n\r\ncommissioned  by  the  Police Force.  That  survey  was  also\r\n\r\nreinforced  by the results of the Straits Times  survey.  The\r\n\r\nsignificant  attributes of the survey were that  90%  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  surveyed  felt  that  the  Police  is  effective   in\r\n\r\nmaintaining law and order, and this is an increase of 6% over\r\n\r\nthe  previous survey.  78% of the people surveyed  found  the\r\n\r\nPolice  is rational in discharging their duties, and this  is\r\n\r\nalso  an increase of 5% over the previous survey.  82%  found\r\n\r\nthat the Police has done well in solving crimes, and this  is\r\n\r\nalso an increase of 3% compared to the previous survey.   76%\r\n\r\nfelt  that the Police provides high quality service, and this\r\n\r\nis  also an improvement of 7% over the previous survey.  When\r\n\r\nthe  respondents  were asked to select five  out  of  the  13\r\n\r\nstatements, whether they are positive statements or  negative\r\n\r\nstatements  of  the  Police,  the  five  top  attributes   or\r\n\r\ndescriptive   terms  of  the  Police  were  that   they   are\r\n\r\nrespectable,  approachable,  well-trained,  disciplined   and\r\n\r\ncapable.   So, the public perception of the Police  is  still\r\n\r\ngenerally  positive.  The fact that the public is willing  to\r\n\r\ncome  forward  and  help the Police in solving  a  number  of\r\n\r\ncrimes  is testimony to the public's confidence in the Police\r\n\r\nForce, that Police will act when they make a report.  In  the\r\n\r\ninstance  of  snatch  theft, motor  vehicle  theft,  robbery,\r\n\r\nhousebreaking, outraging of modesty, murder and rape, 45%  of\r\n\r\nthe  arrests of people who committed these offences were  the\r\n\r\nresult of public cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drop referred to in the headlines in Zaobao was in\r\n\r\nresponse    to    respectability,   and    reliability    and\r\n\r\ntrustworthiness, both registering falls to 77%,  down  by  6%\r\n\r\nfor  respectability; and for reliability and trustworthiness,\r\n\r\ndown  4%, at 57% compared to the previous survey.  But  these\r\n\r\nreductions,  I  believe,  were due to  the  recent  spate  of\r\n\r\nreports  of Police corruption in one major case   -   the  Ah\r\n\r\nLong  San case.  But one must not let this one case  mar  the\r\n\r\nwhole perception and whole performance of the Police Force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put in context, more than 99.9% of our Police Force\r\n\r\nofficers  conduct  themselves well.  Less than  0.1%  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force  officers are charged in court every  year.   I\r\n\r\nthink  we must look at the numbers in perspective.   And  the\r\n\r\nPolice  is  serious in weeding out all these errant  officers\r\n\r\nwhenever they are found, and although the Police knew that it\r\n\r\nwould attract adverse publicity, it does not hesitate to take\r\n\r\nthese  officers to court, even though it may attract  adverse\r\n\r\npublicity against the Police.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mr Sin Boon Ann's suggestion to raise the\r\n\r\npenalty for Police officers who commit criminal offences such\r\n\r\nas  corruption, yes, I will take note of his suggestion.  For\r\n\r\nnow,  I  believe the courts have enough discretion to  impose\r\n\r\nthe maximum penalty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng asked how does the Police make sure that it\r\n\r\nkeeps  up  its  image and the performance  of  its  officers.\r\n\r\nTraining  is  the  key,  as Mr Chng  himself  has  said,  and\r\n\r\nsupervision and management.  There are various measures  that\r\n\r\nthe  Police  has  put in place to ensure  that  its  officers\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  remain on top of the job.   Basic  training  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely a must, and they take a multi-pronged approach  in\r\n\r\ntraining,  inculcating  the  right  values,  competencies  in\r\n\r\ndischarging  their  duties, and they  also  do  psychological\r\n\r\ntests.   In  other  words, before people are  recruited,  our\r\n\r\nPolice  Psychological Unit actually interviews them  and,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as possible, try to sieve out those who are not suitable\r\n\r\nfor the Police Force.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also continuous training on the job, and the\r\n\r\ntraining  for  the supervisors who, I believe, are  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant people in making sure that the officers under their\r\n\r\ncharge  do  the job properly.  Because without good managers,\r\n\r\nwithout  good supervision, then I think something will  give.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  important that we also train our Police  managers\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Iswaran's concern about the public sense of\r\n\r\nsafety,  let  me assure him that generally the  public  still\r\n\r\nfeel  very  safe.  Otherwise, the results of the survey  will\r\n\r\nnot hear this out.  But the question he also raises is: do we\r\n\r\nhave a good PR strategy to deal with these problems that crop\r\n\r\nup  from  time  to  time?  The Police meets  the  press  very\r\n\r\nregularly.   It  briefs them on the major cases.   It  briefs\r\n\r\nthem  on  how it handles its cases.  And I think  the  public\r\n\r\nknow  from these cases and the handling of the cases and  the\r\n\r\nspeed in which the Police solves some of the problems and the\r\n\r\ncases  show  the Police has been quite proactive in  engaging\r\n\r\nthe  media  and  in sharing with them as much information  as\r\n\r\npossible.   But sometimes the Police cannot  tell  the  press\r\n\r\neverything  because  some  of  these  are  operational  trade\r\n\r\nsecrets.  We also do not want the people on the wrong side of\r\n\r\nthe  law to learn about them and find new ways of beating us.\r\n\r\nSo,  sometimes we have to reserve a bit of our  position  and\r\n\r\nnot  tell  everything.   But as far as possible,  the  Police\r\n\r\ntries  to  manage it and get to the public and tell  them  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  they  can.  By informing the public about  what  is\r\n\r\ngoing on, even by reporting the crimes that are committed, it\r\n\r\nalso  serves a purpose to remind the public that although  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  low crime rate in Singapore, it does not  mean  that\r\n\r\nthere is no crime.  So please take the necessary precautions.\r\n\r\nSo,  highlighting  all these cases is not  at  all  bad,  but\r\n\r\nsometimes  we  have to hold back some of the information,  or\r\n\r\neven  have  to ask the press to cooperate not to release  the\r\n\r\ninformation, as it may jeopardise a case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year's kidnapping case is a good example. I know\r\n\r\nthat some journalists got wind of that and, fortunately, they\r\n\r\ncooperated and did not put out the story.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I think the Police operation to catch the culprits\r\n\r\nwould  have been in jeopardy.  It is only after the  culprits\r\n\r\nwere  arrested that the story came out.  I think that is  the\r\n\r\nway  we should manage all these cases.  I suppose if you have\r\n\r\nread  about  cases in Taiwan, I think the press got  to  know\r\n\r\nmore  than  the  police, and I do not think  that  helps  the\r\n\r\nvictim  at  all in solving his or her problem.  That  is  the\r\n\r\nkind  of  approach that we want to take.  But, of  course,  I\r\n\r\nwould say also that we can be a bit more proactive and we can\r\n\r\nfind new ways of marketing ourselves.  And I have always told\r\n\r\nmy  officers  that while they may have a good story,  a  good\r\n\r\nproduct, if they have not told people about how and why  they\r\n\r\ndo  it, then I think they have not won the public  over.   It\r\n\r\nis  not that we want to brag about what we do and gain credos\r\n\r\nand  applause, but really if we have done something  good,  I\r\n\r\nthink the public ought to know it, so that they know that the\r\n\r\nPolice is actually working hard for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Mr Iswaran that we take safety and\r\n\r\nsecurity  very  seriously.  But I also want  to  stress  that\r\n\r\nsafety  and security is not just the job of the Police Force,\r\n\r\nor  the job of the Home Team only.  In fact, the idea that we\r\n\r\nare trying to propagate is that every one of us living in our\r\n\r\ncommunity,  living  in  our HDB flats  and  private  estates,\r\n\r\nactually  has  a  role  to play in ensuring  that  the  place\r\n\r\nremains  a  safe  and secure one for us.  So  this  programme\r\n\r\ncalled  the  Community Safety and Security Programme  is  one\r\n\r\nsuch  programme that we put out to engage the community.   It\r\n\r\nis  not  a programme to pass responsibility to the community,\r\n\r\nas  some  would  like to believe.  The Police will  carry  on\r\n\r\ndoing  its  job, so will CNB, Immigration, Civil Defence  and\r\n\r\nall  the  other departments.  But if the residents themselves\r\n\r\ndo  not  play a role, because they are the ones on the ground\r\n\r\nwho know exactly what goes on, and if they do not play a role\r\n\r\nin  helping to ensure that the place is safe and secure, then\r\n\r\nit is very difficult for the Police to be there all the time.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the Police to be everywhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Community Safety and Security Programme, which Mr\r\n\r\nGoh Choon Kang also said that we should promote and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nencourage,  is indeed something that we ought to  do.   Since\r\n\r\nthe programme was launched in October 1997, we have, to date,\r\n\r\n<br><br>450&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community Safety and Security Programmes already drawn up\r\n\r\nby  the various committees  -  RCs, neighbourhood committees,\r\n\r\nand  they are doing it even in private estates.  I think this\r\n\r\nis  quite encouraging.  The fact that individuals and parents\r\n\r\nare coming forward, eg, to make sure that the zone around the\r\n\r\nschool is safe for the children, is a good sign.  But I think\r\n\r\nmore  should  be  done, not just keeping this programme  only\r\n\r\nwithin  the  grassroots  committees or  only  within  certain\r\n\r\nconcerned  citizens, but all residents who want to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  their place is safe and secure should play a  role.   I\r\n\r\nthink  that is the only way for us to drive out the  would-be\r\n\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, in fact, I take a deep interest\r\n\r\nin this because wearing both hats in the People's Association\r\n\r\nand  the  Police,  I think there is a lot of  synergy  to  be\r\n\r\nderived  between  the community organisations  and  what  the\r\n\r\nPolice, the Civil Defence and the CNB want to do.  It is  not\r\n\r\njust  using the vehicle of the grassroots organisations,  but\r\n\r\nbecause the People's Association is also an organisation that\r\n\r\nhelps  to  promote community bonding, cohesiveness and  self-help  among the community.  We thought that this is really  a\r\n\r\npractical  example  of  active citizenship.   We  talk  about\r\n\r\nSingapore  21 and active citizenship, and I think this  is  a\r\n\r\nconcrete  example  of  what  active  citizens  can   do   for\r\n\r\nthemselves, for self-interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the suggestion to extend this programme to\r\n\r\nschools,  we are already thinking about that, but I  want  to\r\n\r\ntread a bit cautiously here.  Because some may feel, like  Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran  said,  that the schools may attract the  odium  that\r\n\r\nthey have a problem.  Let me assure them that this is not the\r\n\r\ncase  to  highlight a problem in the school,  but  really  to\r\n\r\nencourage  the  school community to also care for  their  own\r\n\r\nsafety and security, within their own neighbourhood.  And the\r\n\r\nstudents will also, in a way, be involved with the community,\r\n\r\nnot just within the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool  itself, but also the neighbourhood around them.   But\r\n\r\nwe can work with the\r\n\r\nschool,  with the parents, teachers and the students, whether\r\n\r\nit is on juvenile delinquency, street gangs or bullies and so\r\n\r\non.   I think it is good that they themselves play a role  in\r\n\r\nidentifying  and  finding solutions to solve these  problems.\r\n\r\nAnd the Home Team will give them the necessary support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to tread cautiously here because some teachers\r\n\r\nmay  not  fully  understand this now.   Some  principals  may\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  we are giving them more work.   So  we  have\r\n\r\ntaken  the first step to brief the cluster supervisors.   Let\r\n\r\nthem understand it.  Then we are going to have a meeting with\r\n\r\nsome  principals so that they can understand what it  is  all\r\n\r\nabout, and those who are willing can experiment on this, just\r\n\r\nas  we  did on the anti-drug campaign.  We have got  all  the\r\n\r\nschools  involved in preventive drug education  now,  and  no\r\n\r\nschool  is  saying that just because it has got an  anti-drug\r\n\r\ncampaign  or it has a group of people coming to talk  to  its\r\n\r\nstudents  on drugs or drug prevention, the school has  got  a\r\n\r\ndrug  problem.  I think that kind of perception is no  longer\r\n\r\nso  visible any more.  I want to take CSSP one step closer to\r\n\r\nthe  schools but, at the same time, I will move it at a  pace\r\n\r\nthat the schools are comfortable with.  The CSSP is really  a\r\n\r\nproject  to complement the community with all the  Home  Team\r\n\r\ndepartments, including the Civil Defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system of working together with police posts,\r\n\r\nworking  together  with the police centre,  is  certainly  an\r\n\r\nimprovement  over the normal community policing concept  that\r\n\r\nwe  have implemented for quite some time.  We have now  moved\r\n\r\nfrom  NPP  to  NPC in two of our Police Divisions.   The  NPC\r\n\r\nwill, since Mr Iswaran asked, let me say to him and all of us\r\n\r\nhere,  actually provide more time for the Police officers  to\r\n\r\ndo  patrols on the ground, because the NPCs can deploy  their\r\n\r\nresources  better.  The results in the two  NPCs  have  shown\r\n\r\nthat  the  crime rate is actually lower, and Police time  for\r\n\r\npatrols  has  actually  increased,  and  the  residents   are\r\n\r\ngenerally  happy with the system.  And in time, by next  year\r\n\r\nor a year after that,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  shall have all our Police Divisions converted to the  NPC\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to Mr Peh Chin Hua's question whether we\r\n\r\nare  only catching the Tua Pek Kongs and not the masterminds.\r\n\r\nThe  Police must be also interested in syndicate leaders, not\r\n\r\njust  only the runners of the syndicates.  Wherever possible,\r\n\r\nthey  will  go  after  them.   The  Police  has  indeed  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful in a number of such cases.  One recent example was\r\n\r\nin  December  last year when the Police smashed  a  syndicate\r\n\r\nwhich  supplied  immigration  offenders  as  labourers.   The\r\n\r\nsyndicate  leader and his associates were all arrested.  They\r\n\r\nwere  all responsible for managing the illegal workers.  They\r\n\r\nwere  deploying them to the various companies  and  worksites\r\n\r\nand  they  were also collecting the payments.  The  syndicate\r\n\r\nleader has since been charged in court and the case will come\r\n\r\nup for trial.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Police also busted two illegal\r\n\r\nmoneylending  syndicates that were active  in  Circuit  Road,\r\n\r\nGeylang  and  Changi  areas.   The  two  masterminds  of  the\r\n\r\nsyndicates  who are responsible for providing  money  to  the\r\n\r\nrunners  to  operate the illegal money-lending business  were\r\n\r\nalso  arrested.   Both  masterminds  have  been  brought   to\r\n\r\njustice.   But breaking up syndicate operations and arresting\r\n\r\nand prosecuting the leader of the masterminds is not a simple\r\n\r\nand  straightforward issue because it  will  take  time.   It\r\n\r\ninvolves  careful  planning, careful intelligence  collection\r\n\r\nand  elaborate investigations.  You do not just rush in there\r\n\r\nand  catch  somebody and say he is the mastermind,  otherwise\r\n\r\nyou  might  catch the wrong guy and the real fellow  may  run\r\n\r\naway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me assure Mr Peh that police does pay a great\r\n\r\ndeal  of attention on the mastermind, just as we also  do  on\r\n\r\nthose who traffic illegal immigrants or who traffic in drugs.\r\n\r\nI  think the most important thing, of course, is to go  after\r\n\r\nthe mastermind. As far as possible that will be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  let me also say that it is more than one person who will\r\n\r\nbe  involved and if we chop one head, new heads will pop  up.\r\n\r\nSome  of them may not even be here to be found.  I will  tell\r\n\r\nyou  that  in  many instances the masterminds of the  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants are actually not in Singapore. They are not  based\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. They might be Singaporeans but  they  are  not\r\n\r\nbased in Singapore.  So it is not that easy to catch them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I will now take the three cuts of Mr Kenneth\r\n\r\nChen, Prof. Chin Tet Yung and Mr Goh Choon Kang.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen said that the Government has made it\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  Singapore citizen mothers,  including  single\r\n\r\nmothers,  who  have lived abroad and divorced  their  foreign\r\n\r\nspouses, to get Singapore Permanent Residence (PR) status for\r\n\r\ntheir children when they return.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first say that it is not true that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  made  it  difficult  for  Singapore  citizen\r\n\r\nmothers  who  have  lived abroad to get PR status  for  their\r\n\r\nchildren  when they return.  These Singapore citizen  mothers\r\n\r\nwould be assessed no differently than if they had resided  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  all  the  time,  in  other  words,  they  are  not\r\n\r\npenalised for having lived or worked overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Mr Chen that the Government adopts a\r\n\r\ncompassionate approach towards female Singapore citizens  who\r\n\r\nsponsor  their children for PR.  Generally, as  long  as  the\r\n\r\nfemale Singapore citizen is able to provide evidence to  show\r\n\r\nthat  she is able to support the family financially, we would\r\n\r\ngrant PR to her children.  This is a justifiable requirement.\r\n\r\nIn  some  cases, it might take some time for her to establish\r\n\r\nher  income.   So  if the Singapore citizen mother  continues\r\n\r\nworking, it should be a matter of time before her child  gets\r\n\r\nPR.   In  the  event  that the child  cannot  be  granted  PR\r\n\r\nimmediately, the child is normally issued a long-term  Social\r\n\r\nVisit Pass or Student's Pass so that he or she can remain  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  with  the mother. In any case,  where  a  case  is\r\n\r\nmarginal, we are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprepared to exercise flexibility in granting PR to the child.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Chin Tet Yung has asked whether Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration and Registration (SIR) can be more transparent in\r\n\r\nits replies to unsuccessful appellants.\r\n\r\nProf. Chin would be pleased to know that this is indeed  what\r\n\r\nSIR aims to do.  SIR regularly reviews the way it replies  to\r\n\r\nappellants.   Over  the  years, the department  has  in  fact\r\n\r\nbecome   more  forthcoming  in  providing  the  reasons   for\r\n\r\nrejection.   More efforts would be made in this direction  in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIR would as far as possible disclose the reasons for\r\n\r\nrejection  to the appellants.  For example, in certain  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  the  foreigner does not have a stable employment,  SIR\r\n\r\nwould  inform  the  appellant that more  time  is  needed  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  his income and employment track record.   There  are\r\n\r\nalso  cases  where SIR would advise the appellant to  produce\r\n\r\nthe necessary documentary evidence to substantiate the claims\r\n\r\nin  the  application,  such as the relationship  between  the\r\n\r\nsponsor and the appellant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the point to note is that in striving to be\r\n\r\nmore  transparent,  SIR  has also  to  be  careful  that  the\r\n\r\nprovision of reasons for rejection does not lead to abuse and\r\n\r\ncircumvention of the evaluation criteria.  SIR would continue\r\n\r\nto  strike  an  appropriate balance between transparency  and\r\n\r\nprevention of abuse, based on the merits of each case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I go to Mr Goh Choon Kang's cut. Mr Goh Choon Kang\r\n\r\nhas  expressed concern over cases involving maid  abuse.   He\r\n\r\nhas  asked  for  a  response  of the  Ministry  to  a  recent\r\n\r\nsuggestion in the Lianhe Zaobao that a unit be set up to deal\r\n\r\nwith  allegations  made by foreign domestic  maids.   Let  me\r\n\r\nassure  the  House  that the maid abuse  situation  is  under\r\n\r\ncontrol.  The number of maid abuse cases is small relative to\r\n\r\ntheir  population  in  Singapore.  In  1999,  there  were  82\r\n\r\nsubstantiated  cases of maid abuse.  This was  slightly  less\r\n\r\nthan the 89\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncases  in 1998.  However, the figures for 1999 and 1998  were\r\n\r\nsignificantly lower when compared to the 1997 figure of  157.\r\n\r\nThis  is  due  to  the fact that in April  1998  we  enhanced\r\n\r\npenalties  against maid abusers in the Penal  Code.   So  the\r\n\r\nsituation has certainly improved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his question whether or not there is a need to set up\r\n\r\na  special  unit to look after or investigate such cases,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry has considered the suggestion but we feel that there\r\n\r\nis no such necessity.  The reason is that these investigators\r\n\r\nare professionally trained and equipped to deal with the wide\r\n\r\nrange  of  offences, including maid abuse and in  some  cases\r\n\r\nfalse  allegation cases.  All complaints and  accusations  by\r\n\r\nmaids are treated seriously and thoroughly investigated,  and\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is a need, interpreters are used.  The  current\r\n\r\nsystem  is  working  well.  There is no  need  to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nseparate unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, last year, a few high\r\n\r\nprofile  drug  busts were reported.  Only  yesterday  it  was\r\n\r\nreported that another drug ring has been crippled.  This  was\r\n\r\nindeed  good  news for Singaporeans.  We should  congratulate\r\n\r\nour  drug  enforcement officers' tremendous effort.  However,\r\n\r\nwe  have  not  been  informed of how this  has  affected  the\r\n\r\nstatistics of drug offenders.  Can the Ministry release  some\r\n\r\nfigures   of  drug  abuse  in  year  1999?   Was  there   any\r\n\r\nimprovement  or  did  any such busts cause  the  drug  abuser\r\n\r\nnumbers to be decreased?  I would also like to request for an\r\n\r\nupdate  of  the rehabilitation effort. What is the percentage\r\n\r\nof drug abusers who have been successfully converted?  At the\r\n\r\npresent  moment, the law is harsh on drug consumers.   It  is\r\n\r\nrightly  so because when one starts to consume drugs,  it  is\r\n\r\nlikely  that he would become a drug addict and we must  spare\r\n\r\nno effort to ensure that this would not happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like the Ministry to consider, instead\r\n\r\nof  harsh punishments such as jail or DRC detention for  long\r\n\r\nperiods  of  time, whether there are more effective  ways  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  first time offenders so that they  would  not  be\r\n\r\nstigmatised and put themselves in a position\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere they will have no opportunity to go back to normal life\r\n\r\nbecause of a moment of weakness.  I think it is important  to\r\n\r\ntry our best to help them to get away from this vicious cycle\r\n\r\nof  drug abuse as the more they are isolated and outcast  the\r\n\r\nmore difficult it is to rehabilitate them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I echo Mr Kenneth\r\n\r\nChen's  request  for more details on the drug  situation  and\r\n\r\nalso  join  with  him  in  congratulating  our  CNB  for  the\r\n\r\nsuccesses  in  fighting the drug problem.  In 1998,  we  were\r\n\r\ninformed  of  the improving drug situation.   They  both  had\r\n\r\ndropped  in  the  number of arrested and improvement  in  the\r\n\r\nrelapse rate of drug addicts over the corresponding figure in\r\n\r\n1994.   It  has  been  two years since,  and  besides  abuses\r\n\r\ninvolving  traditional drugs such as heroin and cannabis,  we\r\n\r\nalso  learn  with concern from the media that abuses  of  new\r\n\r\nforms of drugs such as Ice and Ecstasy have been on the  rise\r\n\r\nin  the  region.   It has also been reported that  these  new\r\n\r\ndrugs  no longer have to be supplied from traditional sources\r\n\r\nlike   the  Golden  Triangle  but  can  be  manufactured   in\r\n\r\nlaboratories here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must ensure that we continue to maintain our\r\n\r\ntough  stance against drug and drug traffickers and to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our young people are adequately informed of the  danger\r\n\r\nof  drugs  and  not experiment with them.  I would  therefore\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister to provide the House with an update\r\n\r\non  the  local drug situation since 1998 and to let  us  know\r\n\r\nwhat his Ministry has done or will do to ensure that the drug\r\n\r\nmenace remains under control, particularly in relation to the\r\n\r\nnewer drugs that have come on to the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the strict\r\n\r\nenforcement of law in Singapore is well-known throughout  the\r\n\r\nworld.

This\r\n\r\nis something that we are very proud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully admire the police force and the various law\r\n\r\nenforcement  agencies  for their spirit  of  professionalism.\r\n\r\nHowever, recently, I discovered that some law\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenforcement  agencies have been too rigid  enforcing  certain\r\n\r\ntypes  of  offences  and they have forgotten  that  sometimes\r\n\r\nwithin  the  law  we  should also  exercise  some  mercy  and\r\n\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in my meet-the-people session, I came across\r\n\r\ntwo  cases.   In  the first case, a resident in  my  GRC  was\r\n\r\nretrenched during the financial crisis.  For quite some time,\r\n\r\nhe  was unable to find a job to support his family.  In order\r\n\r\nto  make  ends  meet,  he was stupid  enough  to  succumb  to\r\n\r\ncircumstances and resorted to sell uncensored VCDs.  Although\r\n\r\nthe  VCDs  he sold were neither pornographic nor religiously-sensitive, they were nevertheless illegal.  During a raid  by\r\n\r\nthe  police, he was arrested.  He pleaded guilty in court and\r\n\r\nwas  sentenced to two years' imprisonment, even though he was\r\n\r\na first offender with no previous conviction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second case involved a female resident in my GRC.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  family  and  some financial  problems,  she  was\r\n\r\ninduced  by  somebody to take  drugs and the very first  time\r\n\r\nwhen  she  was  taking  drugs, she was  arrested  by  Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics Bureau (CNB) officers, and charged in court.   Upon\r\n\r\nconviction,  she  was  sentenced to one year's  imprisonment,\r\n\r\nalbeit a first offender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, selling uncensored VCD is an offence. But for\r\n\r\na  first offender, the sentence of two years in prison is too\r\n\r\nheavy.   In  order  to earn a living, he did  not  resort  to\r\n\r\nrobbery  or secret society activities, but was merely selling\r\n\r\nsome uncensored VCDs.   As a first offender, a sentence of  a\r\n\r\nfew months' imprisonment would have been adequate to serve as\r\n\r\na  deterrence  to  him.  To  me,  a  two-year  jail  term  is\r\n\r\nmanifestly  excessive.   He had given  an  assurance  not  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  the offence.  After interviewing him, I was convinced\r\n\r\nthat  he was truly repentant.  I made representation  on  his\r\n\r\nbehalf to the relevant authority, but it was rejected by  the\r\n\r\nprosecution  and  the judge.  I wonder if we could  sometimes\r\n\r\ntemper  justice  with  mercy,  and  give  these  first   time\r\n\r\noffenders with good mitigating circumstances a chance to turn\r\n\r\nover  a  new  leaf.

Presently, this  is  done  in  several\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries and the results have  been  positive  in\r\n\r\nsolving  crimes  committed by known   criminals.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nintend to go into the technical merits of DNA testing and the\r\n\r\nresults  and  so on, but I am confident that  building  up  a\r\n\r\ndatabase will help in the long term in solving crimes and  of\r\n\r\ncourse in improving our crime fighting abilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the Minister to update the House on what are some\r\n\r\nof the concrete plans that we are doing in this direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, since the introduction of the\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood Police Centres last year, a number of temporary\r\n\r\nNPCs were built to serve residents in various constituencies.\r\n\r\nAs  the NPC is a new concept, there is not much provision  to\r\n\r\nintegrate the siting of NPCs in both new and existing  towns.\r\n\r\nThus,  not  much  priority is given to  NPCs  when  they  are\r\n\r\nselecting  suitable sites for development.   In  many  cases,\r\n\r\nNPCs   were  simply  asked  to  co-locate  with  many   other\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, I would like to make the following\r\n\r\nclarifications:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can the Ministry incorporate the planning of NPCs in the\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGuide  Plan  so that NPCs can be suitably located  to  better\r\n\r\nserve our residents?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the selection criteria when selecting a\r\n\r\nsite for NPC?\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, a Singapore citizen complained\r\n\r\nin  the  Straits  Times of 14th October last  year  that  his\r\n\r\nidentity  card was stolen and he had conclusive  evidence  of\r\n\r\nthe theft; yet he was made to pay $100 for the replacement of\r\n\r\nhis IC.  That incident brings up the following issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it shows that the Government bureaucracy is\r\n\r\ntotally inflexible.  In that case, the Police had caught  the\r\n\r\nthief and the thief had admitted that he had disposed of  the\r\n\r\ncomplainant's IC.  There was indisputable evidence  that  the\r\n\r\ncomplainant's IC was stolen and not negligently  lost.   Yet,\r\n\r\nhe was made to pay $100 for the replacement of his IC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the money collected is excessive. If it is a\r\n\r\ngenuine  case of having one's identity card stolen,  at  most\r\n\r\nthe  Government should only charge an administrative fee  of,\r\n\r\nsay,  $5.   The local banks only charge that amount  for  the\r\n\r\nreplacement  of  lost  ATM cards.  The  amount  of  $100  for\r\n\r\nreplacement of an IC is definitely not, I believe,  to  cover\r\n\r\nfor  the  administrative  cost, but  as  a  punishment  or  a\r\n\r\npenalty.  The end result, of course, is that the Government's\r\n\r\ncoffers  will  become even more with money.   The  Government\r\n\r\nshould  not ingrain in its civil servants to be so inflexible\r\n\r\nwhen  it  comes  to  imposing  penalties.   They  should   be\r\n\r\ncompassionate.  If there is a good explanation or good reason\r\n\r\nwhy  the IC was lost, they should not blindly just force  the\r\n\r\ncomplainant   to   pay   $100  but   look   into   his   case\r\n\r\ncompassionately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, this case shows that if there is no check on\r\n\r\nthe  Government's bureaucracy, it can abuse its powers.   Not\r\n\r\nonly  the  bureaucrats in that instance took  $100  from  the\r\n\r\ncomplainant  but threatened to charge a further $300  if  the\r\n\r\nnext time he lost his IC, although, in the first instance,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  person  had indisputable proof that his IC was  stolen.\r\n\r\nContrasted with the civil servants, the people in the private\r\n\r\nsector must be given top marks.  Happily for the complainant,\r\n\r\nthe POSBank and DBS did not charge him the $5 replacement for\r\n\r\nthe reported loss of his ATM card.  In fact, the officers  of\r\n\r\nthose banks waived the $5 replacement fee when he showed them\r\n\r\nthe police report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that this matter will be looked into by the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Mr Kenneth Chen and Prof. Chin\r\n\r\nasked about the drug situation in Singapore.  Since the  peak\r\n\r\nof  the  drug  problem in 1994, MHA has taken a multi-pronged\r\n\r\napproach in dealing with this problem.  This was done through\r\n\r\npreventive   drug   education,  very  rigorous   enforcement,\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  and  aftercare of those abusers  arrested  or\r\n\r\ndetained in the DRCs.  This strategy has worked well and I am\r\n\r\npleased  to  report  to  the  House  that  the  drug  problem\r\n\r\ncontinues to be well under control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of drug abusers arrested fell by a marked 15%\r\n\r\nfrom  4,500  in  1998 to about 3,800 in 1999.  The  continued\r\n\r\nhigh  price and the low purity level of heroin in  the  local\r\n\r\nmarket  also  confirm  that  the  drug  situation  here   has\r\n\r\nimproved.  The purity level of the heroin, the main  drug  of\r\n\r\nabuse, has fallen to an all time low of less than 3% compared\r\n\r\nto 7% in 1996.  Over the same period, the price of heroin has\r\n\r\nactually increased from $10 a straw to $20 a straw.  For  the\r\n\r\nsecond  consecutive year since 1998, the number of  new  drug\r\n\r\naddicts arrested has also remained below 800.  The last  time\r\n\r\nit  fell  below 800 was in 1986.  CNB's enforcement,  as  you\r\n\r\nread  from  time to time in newspapers, continued  to  remain\r\n\r\nrigorous.   It  conducted  48  major  operations  last  year,\r\n\r\ncrippling  30  drug trafficking syndicates  in  the  process.\r\n\r\nApproximately 50 kg of heroin and about 7 kg of cannabis were\r\n\r\nseized  last  year.  About 100 kg of opium  and  over  17,000\r\n\r\nEcstasy tablets were also seized.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Council Against Drug Abuse has continued to\r\n\r\nplay a crucial role\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin preventive drug education.  The Council works very closely\r\n\r\nwith   the   CNB,   with  the  schools,   voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  as well as the private sector corporations  to\r\n\r\nrun  programmes  to  specifically target at-risk  youths  and\r\n\r\nthere was a mass awareness programme highlighting the dangers\r\n\r\nof  drug abuse.  For example, the Council works closely  with\r\n\r\nSANA  (Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association) to put  together\r\n\r\nan  outreach  programme targeting out-of-school youth  called\r\n\r\nthe  Peer  Alliance Liaison or PAL programme.  Many voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations have since joined  this  programme  to\r\n\r\nturn at-risk youths away from abusing drugs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council also works very closely with advertising\r\n\r\nagencies  under  the banner of Partnership  for  a  Drug-free\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  Partnership  devised  innovative  ways  to\r\n\r\nspread  the  anti-drug message.  Last year,  the  Partnership\r\n\r\norganised  an  anti-drug song writing  contest,  published  a\r\n\r\nparents'  guide  to drug prevention and developed  innovative\r\n\r\nadvertisements showing the dangers of heroin, Ecstasy and Ice\r\n\r\nabuse, and these agencies actually put in a lot of their  own\r\n\r\ntime and resources and expertise in helping in this effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, I briefed Members on the rehabilitation and\r\n\r\naftercare  measures  undertaken  by  my  Ministry.    And   I\r\n\r\nhighlighted  the  community-based  programme  which  releases\r\n\r\naddicts  into  the community to continue their rehabilitation\r\n\r\nin  supportive environment, such as half-way houses  and  the\r\n\r\noffer  of  employment opportunities for addicts  through  the\r\n\r\nSCORE's job placement service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides continuing with these measures, we also offer\r\n\r\nmore educational and vocational training for drug addicts  in\r\n\r\nthe  past years.  The commencement of the Prisons school this\r\n\r\nyear also gives better facilities and more opportunities  for\r\n\r\ndrug  addicts to study.  Information technology classes  have\r\n\r\nalso  been  introduced to the drug inmates  last  year.   And\r\n\r\nthese   measures  have  contributed  in  some  way   to   the\r\n\r\nreintegration of the addicts into our society.  As a  result,\r\n\r\nwe saw a decline of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe relapse rate from 81% in 1994 to about 52% last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For first-time abusers, Mr Chen has asked whether there\r\n\r\nare  better or more effective ways of dealing with them.  Let\r\n\r\nme  assure  Mr  Chen  that we do try to help  the  first-time\r\n\r\nabusers who are earnest in wanting to kick their drug  habit.\r\n\r\nThe  Prisons  Department actually runs a treatment  programme\r\n\r\ncalled  the Voluntary Treatment Programme which is  basically\r\n\r\nintended for first-time abusers.  Under this programme, first-time abusers who confess and volunteer to go for treatment in\r\n\r\nChangi  Hospital  will  be given the opportunity  to  undergo\r\n\r\ndetoxification  and follow-up counselling  sessions,  without\r\n\r\nbeing  committed to the DRC and therefore have no record,  so\r\n\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the number of first-time abusers who actually\r\n\r\nsuccessfully complete this programme is dismally  low.   Many\r\n\r\nof  them  just  do  not have the stamina,  determination  and\r\n\r\ndiscipline to go through with it.  Out of the 137 abusers who\r\n\r\nsigned  up  for this programme since 1996, only  44  of  them\r\n\r\neventually completed the programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to help the first-time abusers to help\r\n\r\nthemselves.   But,  ultimately, they  must  help  themselves.\r\n\r\nBecause if they do not, nobody can help them.  If Mr Chen  or\r\n\r\nanybody else can think of better ways of rehabilitating them,\r\n\r\nI would be very happy to look into them.  But let me tell him\r\n\r\nand  everybody here, that nobody enjoys sending a drug abuser\r\n\r\nto a court or to the DRC, because ultimately we would like to\r\n\r\nhave  our  society rid of this problem.  But if he  does  not\r\n\r\nheed  the  law,  then, of course, the law  has  to  take  its\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Mr Chng's question about the DNA technology,\r\n\r\nlet  me  say that my Minister of State has already  mentioned\r\n\r\nsomething  like  that the last time he spoke  on  this.   The\r\n\r\nPolice is already beginning to study this to find out how  it\r\n\r\ncan make better use of DNA technology for its investigations.\r\n\r\nAnd it is looking at the practices\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin other countries, such as UK and US which have successfully\r\n\r\nset  up  such databases.  The setting up of the database  for\r\n\r\nDNA is indeed a strategic thrust of the Police.  For forensic\r\n\r\nand  intelligence-led investigations, DNA  should  become  an\r\n\r\nimportant  tool for criminal investigation as  the  criminals\r\n\r\nare   now   becoming  more  sophisticated,  and  conventional\r\n\r\ninvestigation  methods  will  become  inadequate.   But   the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of a DNA database is not a straightforward  task\r\n\r\nbecause  it  will  take time, as operational,  technical  and\r\n\r\nlegal  issues need to be looked at.  We are now working  with\r\n\r\nthe Health Ministry and AG's Chambers on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about the NPCs and the criteria we\r\n\r\nuse  for  selecting the sites for the NPCs.  We want to  site\r\n\r\nthe  NPC where the community is.  Where else can it  be?   It\r\n\r\ncannot  be  tucked  in a corner somewhere in  Singapore.   It\r\n\r\nought  to  be convenient, central and easily accessible.   As\r\n\r\nfar  as  possible, we will also try to site the NPC  together\r\n\r\nwith the community clubs, community centres.  We already have\r\n\r\ndone  so in a couple of the community clubs and centres where\r\n\r\nthe  NPCs  are co-located.  Over the years, we are  going  to\r\n\r\nhave  another  10  or 12 more such NPCs co-located  with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity clubs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a policy of the Government, and here I am wearing\r\n\r\nmy  two hats as People Association's Deputy Chairman as  well\r\n\r\nas  the Minister in charge of Police, that we would have  the\r\n\r\nNPC co-located with the community club as far as possible. We\r\n\r\nhave  to  maximise the land use.  It is a luxury  to  have  a\r\n\r\nstand-alone  community club occupying 0.4 or 0.5 hectares  of\r\n\r\nspace.   I think in land scarce Singapore, we should maximise\r\n\r\nthe land use, put as much of our communal facilities together\r\n\r\nas  possible, so that they can share in the use  of  land  as\r\n\r\nwell as become convenient points of contact for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of other organisations are co-located with the\r\n\r\ncommunity  clubs,  such  as  the library,  NTUC  child  care,\r\n\r\nCouncil of Social Services and some corporate members of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me take Mr\r\n\r\nPeh  Chin Hua's cut.  I would now respond to his concern that\r\n\r\nthere  should be greater compassion when the Police  and  law\r\n\r\nenforcement   departments  enforce  our  laws,   particularly\r\n\r\nagainst first-time offenders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both the Police and the Attorney-General's Chambers\r\n\r\nalready  exercise compassion whenever appropriate,  before  a\r\n\r\ndecision is made to prosecute offenders.  If the offence is a\r\n\r\nminor  one and the offender has a good record, indeed he  may\r\n\r\nbe let off with a warning, instead of being charged in court.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in 1998, over 1,800, constituting about 40%  of\r\n\r\nshoplifters,  were  let off with a warning.   However,  being\r\n\r\nforced by circumstances as an excuse is not acceptable and is\r\n\r\nnot  a justification for committing an offence.  Sir, neither\r\n\r\nshould  a  person be exonerated nor spared punishment  merely\r\n\r\nbecause he is a first-time offender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, cases of the sort that Mr Peh mentioned must have\r\n\r\nbeen  serious enough for the offenders to be charged in court\r\n\r\nin  the  first place.  The court then takes into account  all\r\n\r\nthe   relevant  facts  and  mitigating  circumstances  before\r\n\r\ndeciding on the appropriate punishment in accordance with the\r\n\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our laws and enforcement approach are tough but\r\n\r\nfair.   Our  enforcement agencies will continue  to  exercise\r\n\r\ncompassion  where justified.  In line with this approach,  as\r\n\r\nMr  Peh  would know, my Ministry is working with the relevant\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies to put in place a range of new sentencing\r\n\r\noptions  such  as  community service orders,  front-end  home\r\n\r\ndetention,  boot  camps, and probation for  adult  offenders.\r\n\r\nThese  sentencing  options  carry  a  greater  rehabilitative\r\n\r\nelement  and would be suitable for persons who have committed\r\n\r\nrelatively  minor  offences and first time  offenders.   They\r\n\r\nwill complement existing forms of punishment and broaden  the\r\n\r\ncourt's sentencing options.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now take Mr Chiam's cut. Mr Chiam has commented\r\n\r\nthat persons who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  victims  of  crime are also penalised by  the  deterrent\r\n\r\nreplacement  fee through no fault of theirs.  He  feels  that\r\n\r\nour  civil servants are bureaucratic and Government is unfair\r\n\r\nin  levying the replacement fee of $100.  First, let  me  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  deterrent  replacement fee  complements  Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration and Registration's (SIR)  public education effort\r\n\r\nto  get Singaporeans to take good care of their ICs. So it is\r\n\r\nnot    a   blunderbuss   approach.    Indeed,   before    its\r\n\r\nimplementation  in  July 1998, there was  a  public  campaign\r\n\r\nadvising Singaporeans of the situation which was bad at  that\r\n\r\ntime and in fact giving prior warning to Singaporeans that if\r\n\r\nthe  situation  did not improve, tougher penalties  would  be\r\n\r\nimposed.  Before the fees were implemented in July 1998,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of lost ICs was not only high, but was on an uptrend.\r\n\r\nThe monthly average of about 3,300 cards lost in 1997 rose to\r\n\r\nabout  4,000 in the first half of 1998.  The number has since\r\n\r\ndropped  to 2,600 monthly for the whole of 1999, which  means\r\n\r\nthat with the deterrent regime people have been reminded that\r\n\r\nit is important to take good care of their ICs.  This figure,\r\n\r\nalthough lower, is still a serious problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure Mr Chiam that SIR, like I have said\r\n\r\njust  now,  does not take a blunderbuss approach  because  it\r\n\r\ndoes  exercise discretion in waiving the deterrent  component\r\n\r\nof  the replacement fee carefully on the merits of each case.\r\n\r\nFor  example, SIR waives the penalty where the IC  holder  is\r\n\r\nnot at fault, such as in the case of break-ins, robberies, or\r\n\r\nlosses  due to fire.  Indeed, between July 1998 and  February\r\n\r\n2000,  SIR waived the penalty for about 7,000 cases.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthese  IC  holders only have to pay the recurrent replacement\r\n\r\nfee of $60 which incidentally is just above the cost of a new\r\n\r\nIC  which is about $50.  So the Government is not levying the\r\n\r\nfee to make money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The onus is on the IC holders to explain the\r\n\r\ncircumstances in which the loss occurred.  In cases where the\r\n\r\ncircumstances of the loss were dubious, for example,  persons\r\n\r\nare  unable to recollect how the IC was lost, the request for\r\n\r\nwaiver of the penalty fees will not be acceded to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Chiam  referred to a writer in the Straits  Times'  Forum\r\n\r\nlast  year  and I believe there were also one  or  two  other\r\n\r\nwriters.   Let me tell him that, following further interviews\r\n\r\nand  clarifications given by the IC holders in  those  cases,\r\n\r\nSIR gave them the benefit of the doubt and waived the penalty\r\n\r\nfees for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point is that Mr Chiam compares the\r\n\r\napproach  taken  by banks to SIR.  Banks do not  charge  very\r\n\r\nhigh  administration fee for an ATM card.  Is he  serious  in\r\n\r\ncomparing an ATM card with an IC?  If one loses an ATM  card,\r\n\r\nperhaps  at  most, he loses his money in the  bank.   If  one\r\n\r\nloses  an  IC and if enough Singaporeans lose their  ICs,  it\r\n\r\nwill  impact  on Singaporean's sense of safety  and  security\r\n\r\nbecause you may have people who get hold of these ICs and, in\r\n\r\nfact,  there are syndicates who do that, and they  will  fall\r\n\r\ninto  wrong  hands.   That is why I think  we  must  be  very\r\n\r\ncareful with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

One  is  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  we devote sufficient resources  and  effort  to\r\n\r\nbuild Singapore into an advanced knowledge-based economy that\r\n\r\ncan compete with the rest of the world.  The second\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimperative is to mould and build our local people  and  local\r\n\r\ncapabilities that could measure up against the  best  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, within the framework of Singapore, we are\r\n\r\nactually  faced with many constraints.  First, we are  small.\r\n\r\nSecond,  we  have  no resources and, third, we  have  limited\r\n\r\nmanpower.  But remarkably, despite these handicaps,  we  have\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  work  together  as a nation  that  has  achieved\r\n\r\nphenomenal  stability and growth in the last  30  years,  and\r\n\r\nranked as one of the most competitive countries in the world.\r\n\r\nNo mean achievement for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to discuss in big broad strokes some of\r\n\r\nthe  major issues and actions that the Ministry of Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  has  to  address as the key  national  agency  that\r\n\r\noversees  economic development of Singapore.  Given our  well\r\n\r\nknown constraint, this is not an enviable task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on cost competitiveness, because of our shortage of\r\n\r\nland and manpower, our cost of doing business continues to be\r\n\r\nhigh  and  not competitive versus the neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has been vigilant over business  costs.   We\r\n\r\ncannot artificially suppress business costs, but we should at\r\n\r\nleast  ensure that such costs do not escalate, or unnecessary\r\n\r\ncosts  or  time  be  wasted  due to  bureaucratic  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations.   Many of my fellow GPC colleagues have  touched\r\n\r\non this point.  Some, such as Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee\r\n\r\nHua,  have  conjured  the vision of an entrepreneurial  civil\r\n\r\nservice.   I  support their vision, but I despair  that  this\r\n\r\nvision  will  only  remain as a hope  unless  there  is  more\r\n\r\nurgency  in  the declared plan on infusion of entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nblood  in  the  top  ranks  of  the  civil  service  and  the\r\n\r\nleadership, and a major paradigm shift in the mindset of  our\r\n\r\ncivil servants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, maximising the use of our resources. We have to\r\n\r\nmaximise the use of our limited resources.  The land  use  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  can be intensified by allowing higher plot  ratios\r\n\r\nfor  land  development and more flexibility in the change  of\r\n\r\nuse\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the type of use of our land.  For example, Sentosa Island\r\n\r\nis one of our main tourist attractions, and the playground of\r\n\r\nthe  residents living in the main city.  Hence, I  feel  that\r\n\r\nSentosa  Island should have been more intensively  developed,\r\n\r\nand  the infrastructure should be improved.  More attractions\r\n\r\ncan be added.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also do a review of our electricity, gas and\r\n\r\nwater  supply and the usage policy so as to ensure that these\r\n\r\nprecious  resources  are efficiently  produced  and  used  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, maximising the use of our limited manpower. As\r\n\r\nit  is  now,  we  have to bring in large numbers  of  foreign\r\n\r\nprofessionals  and  workers  to supplement  our  local  pool.\r\n\r\nHence, we have to create an environment where both local  and\r\n\r\nforeign  manpower can give their best.  By this,  I  mean  we\r\n\r\nhave to actively promote technopreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from my professional occupation as a director of\r\n\r\na  local firm that is interested in e-commerce investments, I\r\n\r\nhave  recently met with and come across many local firms  and\r\n\r\nyoung  persons who want to start up new businesses.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\ncan  feel  in them a strong sense of purpose and  urgency  in\r\n\r\nthem  wanting to venture out and start up companies based  on\r\n\r\ntheir  ideas  and  dreams.  The Government  has  started  the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneurship  21  programme.   I  fully   support   this\r\n\r\nprogramme.   In fact, I would like to urge the Government  to\r\n\r\ndo more, such as providing more funds, support facilities and\r\n\r\ncreate a conducive environment for enterprise, and for  those\r\n\r\ndaring to dream and daring to venture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall elaborate on each of the above ideas in\r\n\r\nmore detail as I speak on each of the subjects later.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I support\r\n\r\nefforts  to promote our external economic wing by encouraging\r\n\r\ncompanies   and   Singaporeans  to  invest   overseas.    All\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are representatives of our country when we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare abroad.  We are all ambassadors of Singapore.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nhow Singapore companies manage and how Singapore managers and\r\n\r\nworkers   conduct  themselves  will  affect  the   impression\r\n\r\nordinary  people of the host country will have of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  is  therefore  in  our national interest  for  people  in\r\n\r\ncountries  receiving  our  investments  to  have  a  positive\r\n\r\nimpression   of   Singapore.   To  cultivate  this   positive\r\n\r\nimpression,  we  need to look beyond sheer  profits  for  our\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Local people who work in Singapore companies  and\r\n\r\nwith Singapore managers are in the best position to act as  a\r\n\r\nconduit for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many examples of countries with poor record.\r\n\r\nThe  United States has a terrible record of human  rights  in\r\n\r\nLatin America which is still being repaired.  There are  also\r\n\r\nrecords  of  some East Asian countries with  poor  record  of\r\n\r\nhuman  and  labour relations in some of the South East  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries.   Therefore,  Singapore  companies  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nmanagers  will  have to realise that it is not  just  profits\r\n\r\nthat   make   for  successful  business.   Beyond  maximising\r\n\r\nshareholder value and pursuing economic efficiency, companies\r\n\r\nwill  need the human face and human values, ie, the  need  to\r\n\r\nsustain families, treat men and women equally, look after the\r\n\r\nenvironment,  to  respect natural justice,  to  give  workers\r\n\r\ndignity  at  the workplace, respect the rights of workers  to\r\n\r\nform trade unions and to conduct collective bargaining and to\r\n\r\ncomply with the laws of the land of the host country, and the\r\n\r\nlist can go on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in this context, Sir, I like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  while encouraging investments  overseas,  his\r\n\r\nMinistry   should   also  advise  Singapore   companies   and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to be aware of social issues and  sensitivities\r\n\r\nlike  labour  rights, human rights and environmental  issues.\r\n\r\nThis  is  especially needed when operating in countries  with\r\n\r\nrepressive  regimes  in  power.  It  is  better  that  we  be\r\n\r\nproactive  in  this area before someone does  something  that\r\n\r\ndamages Singapore's good name.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, allow me to begin my cut with an\r\n\r\nillustration.  There\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas   once  a  contract  manufacturer  which  began  a   very\r\n\r\nsuccessful operation in Singapore.  It was able to  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  a huge multinational electronics corporation  that\r\n\r\nhad   decided   to   outsource  some  of  its   manufacturing\r\n\r\nactivities.  As time grew, more MNCs became its customers and\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, capacity was gradually added.  Every employee,\r\n\r\nincluding the non-production worker, could see and  feel  the\r\n\r\npace  of growth.  Because the company's track record  was  so\r\n\r\ngood, when its biggest client decided to produce in China, it\r\n\r\nwas  invited  to  set up supporting manufacturing  facilities\r\n\r\nthere.  Growth there was soon exponential, well in excess  of\r\n\r\nthat in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if the Singaporean employees were focusing only on\r\n\r\nthe  hive of activity at their own plant, they would not have\r\n\r\nshared the excitement of growth in China.  Likewise, if there\r\n\r\nwas  a  structural  change  which led  to  the  MNCs  ceasing\r\n\r\nproduction  in  China, they also would  be  none  the  wiser.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  they  had  had a total picture  of  the  entire\r\n\r\nnetwork of operations, they would be better informed of their\r\n\r\ncompany's  plight through thick or thin.  Sir,  I  hope  this\r\n\r\nillustration  will  convey the need  to  plug  the  following\r\n\r\ninformation  gaps  in  the  measurement  and  assessment   of\r\n\r\neconomic activity for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to enable Singaporeans to embrace the global\r\n\r\nnature of our economic being, we should also highlight  Gross\r\n\r\nNational  Product  (GNP),  or  its  equivalent,  instead   of\r\n\r\nstopping  at  Gross  Domestic Product (GDP).   This  gives  a\r\n\r\nbroader  reflection  of our reach outside  of  Singapore.   A\r\n\r\nquick  look at the 1999 Economic Survey shows some  differing\r\n\r\ntrends,  granted that comparison only in current price  terms\r\n\r\nis available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, even though services, including financial\r\n\r\nservices,  constitute a substantial pillar  of  our  economy,\r\n\r\nmeasures  are  few, perhaps inherently so.   Nonetheless,  as\r\n\r\nservices are crucial to us, I would like to urge the Minister\r\n\r\nto continue seeking out appropriate measures and indicators.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrade statistics abound and are available on a monthly basis,\r\n\r\nbut  they  do not form a complete picture.  Hence,  they  may\r\n\r\noverstate the deterioration in the economy, as was  the  case\r\n\r\nfor some months in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, business cycles have shortened through the\r\n\r\njudicious application of technology. Therefore, frequency and\r\n\r\ntimeliness   of  economic  statistics  are  key  to   helping\r\n\r\ncompanies  and individuals project ahead.  Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nexplore how far this can be done?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, first I would like to declare\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  a  Director  of a company involved  in  property\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   We  have to maximise the use  of  our  limited\r\n\r\nland.   I  like to propose the following suggestions  on  how\r\n\r\nland can be used more intensively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to allow the use of higher plot ratios for land\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Compared to the major cities around  the  world\r\n\r\nlike  Tokyo,  Hong  Kong  and New  York,  Singapore  is  less\r\n\r\ndeveloped  in  terms  of land use.  In  these  cities,  their\r\n\r\nbuildings are definitely higher and land development is being\r\n\r\nused more intensively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to allow more flexibility in the usage and\r\n\r\nchange of use of existing buildings and built-up areas.  Some\r\n\r\nbuildings or areas were constructed for an original  approved\r\n\r\nusage.  However, over time, the demand or the nature  of  the\r\n\r\nlocation  changes. Hence, there may well be a need to  change\r\n\r\nthe  usage  to  another type so as to match  the  surrounding\r\n\r\ndevelopments. For example, a building may originally be built\r\n\r\nas  an  industrial building.  But as it turns out,  there  is\r\n\r\nmore  demand  in  the  locality for use of  the  premises  as\r\n\r\nshowrooms,  offices or even as residences. The owners  should\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  allowed  more flexibility  in  the  usage  and\r\n\r\nconversion.  Otherwise, the building will remain  vacant  and\r\n\r\nunused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the possibility of co-location and mixed use of\r\n\r\ndifferent types of premises will enable more intensive use of\r\n\r\na building.  Subletting and renewal of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleases  will enable the existing premises to be better  used,\r\n\r\nor re-developed for other purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in land scarce Singapore, I feel that within\r\n\r\ncertain broad rules and guidelines, it is very critical  that\r\n\r\nland use be more flexible and intensified.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, we are familiar about the\r\n\r\ncurrent  interest and the type of industries we want for  our\r\n\r\neconomy  to  grow  and we have focused a  lot  on  the  info-communications     area,     electronics,     semi-conductor,\r\n\r\npharmaceutical  and chemical industries and  I  believe  that\r\n\r\nsome  of  us will start planning about the type of industries\r\n\r\nwe want 20 to 30 years from now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister as to what, in his\r\n\r\nopinion, we should be focusing on in the longer term. Are  we\r\n\r\ndoing  enough in promoting life sciences, bio-technology  and\r\n\r\ngenetic engineering in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to my next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Carry on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Many Members have expressed their\r\n\r\nconcern  that  by  rolling back some of the cost  containment\r\n\r\nmeasures,  it  may  affect the cost  competitiveness  of  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector and businesses in general.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on a few of these issues. First\r\n\r\nof all, I am concerned that the JTC rentals of factories will\r\n\r\ngo  up as a result of the property tax rebate reduction  from\r\n\r\n55%  to  25%.   Similarly, the rental rebates implemented  in\r\n\r\n1998  will eventually be removed, bringing land cost back  to\r\n\r\npre-crisis  levels.   If this happens,  we  will  once  again\r\n\r\nbecome   uncompetitive  as  compared  to   our   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries where permanent reductions in prices have occurred.\r\n\r\nI  therefore feel that through land intensification measures,\r\n\r\nwe  can  keep  our future land and rental costs low  and  any\r\n\r\nfuture  increases  will  continue to be  benchmarked  against\r\n\r\nworld  prices so that we remain relevant in these industries.\r\n\r\nMr Leong has given some excellent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexamples of how we can keep land cost low in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we should watch out against any drastic\r\n\r\nincreases  in  Government fees and charges in  the  next  few\r\n\r\nyears.  These too should be benchmarked against global prices\r\n\r\nbefore increasing any of these in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have been pre-occupied by cost issues in\r\n\r\nmost  of  the measures that we have implemented in  the  past\r\n\r\ncouple of years and I think we should now go beyond cost  and\r\n\r\nfocus  on value-added activities as the focus on how  we  can\r\n\r\nbecome competitive in the future.  One possible concept is to\r\n\r\nencourage  more  assetless companies who can outsource  their\r\n\r\nmake  functions to any part of the world, while  focusing  on\r\n\r\nthe  value creation activities with the limited resources  we\r\n\r\nhave here in Singapore.  This will require a different set of\r\n\r\nincentive  schemes and I suggest the Ministry study  possible\r\n\r\noptions  to  encourage  the  growth  of  such  companies   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I have a concern that there will be increases\r\n\r\nof utility charges as we go on.  In fact, electricity charges\r\n\r\nhave  already gone up by almost 20% recently while prices  of\r\n\r\nwater  will  be going up later this year as was announced  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance. While I understand that we need  to\r\n\r\nprice  water  realistically, I believe  that  the  Government\r\n\r\ncould  have  held  back  any increases  by  another  year  to\r\n\r\nminimise any increases during this transition year and  which\r\n\r\nwe  can continue increasing as we go along in the future.  On\r\n\r\nthe  issue of the cost of electricity, I feel that the  power\r\n\r\ngeneration and distribution infrastructures in Singapore  are\r\n\r\nnot  operating efficiently enough.  In fact, I  believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  cost  is  about  two to three times  more  expensive  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  compared to the United States  of  America.  I\r\n\r\nstrongly  feel  that  we  need to  completely  privatise  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  power  generation and distribution services  and  to\r\n\r\nopen up these to true foreign competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, still on the issue of power, there have been\r\n\r\ntoo many instances of power\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndips, causing serious disruptions to our high-tech industries\r\n\r\nlike  wafer  fabs and also some semi-conductor  manufacturing\r\n\r\nfacilities. These dips and disruptions cause money and I feel\r\n\r\nthat the company should not bear the full burden of this cost\r\n\r\nand that the power distribution company should also be liable\r\n\r\nfor part of the cost incurred by the affected companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the projection of\r\n\r\nthe  World Bank and the Asian Development Bank made  in  1997\r\n\r\nfor  environmental infrastructural projects  such  as  water,\r\n\r\nsewerage, power and waste management in South East Asia alone\r\n\r\nwas about US$20-US$30 billion annually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the countries in this part of the world become more\r\n\r\naffluent,  demand for such environmental related  businesses,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  non-infrastructural products  and  processes,\r\n\r\nwill,  in  fact,  be  much larger.  And if  we  consider  the\r\n\r\ncountries  of  China  and India and  South  Korea,  if  these\r\n\r\ncountries  are included, the size of the potential market  in\r\n\r\nsuch  businesses  in this region could be as  high  as  about\r\n\r\nUS$50-US$60 billion annually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a small country and we are constantly\r\n\r\non  the  lookout for suitable business and industrial  niches\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, I think Singapore, being right in the middle\r\n\r\nof  Asia,  cannot ignore this potential niche. We  have  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in  niches  such  as  finance,  electronics   and\r\n\r\nspecialty    chemicals.    We   are   now    promoting    IT,\r\n\r\ntelecommunications and the life sciences.  Surely, given  the\r\n\r\npotential of the environment-related industry, we should also\r\n\r\npromote this particular sector to be located in Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nhope that the Ministry sees such a potential and gets EDB  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  serious look at these businesses.  I also hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister,  when  he  asks EDB, will  also  consider  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  initiatives  to  help Singapore  develop  into  an\r\n\r\nenvironment industrial park.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, there should be schemes to support and\r\n\r\nencourage environmental\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs  to start up new companies  similar  to  those\r\n\r\ngiven to IT entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an Exim-type of financing facilities to be\r\n\r\nmade  available to support projects in emerging economies  in\r\n\r\nthe  region.   In  this particular business,  such  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  is quite common. In fact, one of the reasons  why\r\n\r\nthe  South  Korean  companies  and  the  Japanese  companies,\r\n\r\namongst  the  Asian  countries, are very successful  in  this\r\n\r\nbusiness  is  because of the Exim-type of loans  provided  by\r\n\r\ntheir  respective countries or by institutions  supported  by\r\n\r\nthe Government.  This will certainly help Singapore companies\r\n\r\nto  compete  with  companies like  the  Japanese  and  Korean\r\n\r\ncompanies.  And, more importantly, it will put us on the same\r\n\r\nfooting as a lot of other western companies too and, in fact,\r\n\r\nsome  form  of  equal partnership can be formed  between  the\r\n\r\nSingapore companies and the foreign companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, financial incentives for Singaporeans and\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  Singapore should be  given  for  them  to  use\r\n\r\nenvironment  positive products and processes.  This  type  of\r\n\r\nfinancing  incentive  will certainly  encourage  the  greater\r\n\r\nusage  of  environment  positive products  and  processes  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   leading,  I  believe,  to  a  very  much   better\r\n\r\nenvironment here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to share my\r\n\r\nthoughts  on  how we can participate in the Internet  economy\r\n\r\nand  what all of us, both the public and private sectors, can\r\n\r\ndo   in  order  to  compete  successfully  in  this  economy,\r\n\r\nespecially in the area of e-commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the barriers to entry in the e-commerce\r\n\r\narena  are  typically very low and we will  see  many  almost\r\n\r\nsimilar businesses sprouting all around the world as compared\r\n\r\nto  those  that  we  start here in Singapore.  One  important\r\n\r\nlesson  to  learn  is that while we may  have  thought  of  a\r\n\r\nseemingly unique idea and business model, there are many more\r\n\r\nsmart  people around the world who have probably also thought\r\n\r\nof it at about the same time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, the first mover advantage is going to be  the  key\r\n\r\nand  the first mover is the one who introduces the idea first\r\n\r\nto  the marketplace. Having become the first mover, speed and\r\n\r\nconstant  innovation and improvement will help  us  keep  the\r\n\r\nlead and I will not belabour on the Internet speed again.  It\r\n\r\nis crucial in this area if you want to be successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for our companies to be successful, they will\r\n\r\nneed very good and cheap infrastructure which, in my opinion,\r\n\r\nis  still  an  issue  in Singapore.  Some Members,  in  their\r\n\r\nearlier  speeches during the MCIT debate, have  compared  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  using broadband network here with those around  the\r\n\r\nworld.  We  are  still  not competitive  and  while  for  big\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  the cost may not be a major issue, for  many  of\r\n\r\nour start-up companies, the cost is still very painful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, my concern is that in our eagerness to promote\r\n\r\nthe  information  communications  industry,  many  investors,\r\n\r\nincluding the National Science and Technology Board,  may  be\r\n\r\ndisbursing  funds  a bit too liberally.   In  fact,  we  have\r\n\r\nalready  used about half a billion dollars of the $1  billion\r\n\r\nfund  in  these  last six months.  While I am not  advocating\r\n\r\nthat we should slow things down, I do, however, feel that  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  inject some realism as to what the Internet economy\r\n\r\nis  all  about. At the end of the day, a business is still  a\r\n\r\nbusiness, and a sound model and strategy are still needed  in\r\n\r\norder  to  compete effectively globally. So I hope  that  our\r\n\r\nyoung  and  aspiring  technopreneurs  will  look  beyond  the\r\n\r\ninitial  hype and the short-term possibilities and  focus  on\r\n\r\nbuilding  sustainable  businesses for  the  long  term.   The\r\n\r\ntypical terms used in the Internet economy are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The \"burn rate\" which refers to the rate at which\r\n\r\nyou spend the money in sustaining the business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The \"last man spending\" which refers to when the\r\n\r\nmoney  eventually runs out at the rate at which it  is  being\r\n\r\nburnt.  The last company that remains in business is the  one\r\n\r\nthat is going to be the winner.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are very interesting terms but every entrepreneur\r\n\r\nshould  treat his every cent as his or her own and he  should\r\n\r\nnot  develop the attitude that someone else's money is  being\r\n\r\nburnt,  and  this  is the danger of liberal  availability  of\r\n\r\nfunds in trying to promote such an Internet economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, to be successful, we need to focus on building\r\n\r\nbusinesses  that  have good or unique technology  content  or\r\n\r\nunique   technology  applications  or  those  who  make   our\r\n\r\ntraditional  brick and mortar businesses more efficient  with\r\n\r\nthe use of information technology.  I therefore urge both the\r\n\r\nprivate  and public sectors to focus in these areas  if  they\r\n\r\nreally want to be successful and, in the long term, when  the\r\n\r\nbubble  bursts and the hype goes away, only the fundamentally\r\n\r\nstrong companies are the ones that will be left standing.  So\r\n\r\nthere  are  portals that we see developing which will  be  in\r\n\r\ndanger  if  they do not build fundamentally strong ideas  and\r\n\r\nstrategies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, one useful role I believe that the National\r\n\r\nScience  and  Technology  Board  can  play  is  to  regularly\r\n\r\norganise  lessons, sharing seminars or gatherings,  where  we\r\n\r\ncan  invite  both  the  local and foreign  technopreneurs  to\r\n\r\nimpart  their experiences, both good and bad, so that we  can\r\n\r\navoid  making the same mistakes others have made in the past.\r\n\r\nUp  to now, we have been painting too rosy a picture and have\r\n\r\nhighlighted  mainly  the successful companies  and  very  few\r\n\r\nfailures have been highlighted. We should, in fact, celebrate\r\n\r\nboth  failures  and  successful companies,  especially  those\r\n\r\nfailures who eventually made it again after they have  failed\r\n\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have no choice but to participate in this new\r\n\r\neconomy and, in doing so, we should be well-prepared and play\r\n\r\nwith the desire to win big.  We therefore must ensure that we\r\n\r\nbuild a conducive environment for this to happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, whether we like\r\n\r\nit  or  not,  employment of e-commerce as a  means  of  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the Internet economy is increasing with each passing day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a global player, Singapore has no choice but to\r\n\r\nembrace  its  widespread use.  I am happy to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nacceleration of the e-commerce usage has been identified as a\r\n\r\nkey  strategy under one of the three pronged approach to  SME\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the  recent  SME  21  launch.   While  I  am\r\n\r\nencouraged   that   the  Minister  for   Communications   and\r\n\r\nInformation  Technology has spoken in this House about  swift\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the telecommunications industry and  keener\r\n\r\ncompetition  which  will benefit consumers,  I  am  concerned\r\n\r\nabout  the  preparedness of businesses to face this  dramatic\r\n\r\nchange expected in the near future.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several of my MP colleagues yesterday, and Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh a moment ago, also spoke at length about  the\r\n\r\nrapidly  increasing e-commerce trends and the urgent need  to\r\n\r\neducate  and reach out to various constituent groups of  this\r\n\r\nimpending change.  My primary concern is the urgent  need  to\r\n\r\nget  Singapore SMEs to exploit e-commerce to enable  them  to\r\n\r\neffectively compete in the global marketplace.   We  need  to\r\n\r\nquickly  plug  them on to existing B-to-B and B-to-C  portals\r\n\r\nand,  wherever necessary, facilitate the development of  more\r\n\r\nportals for various sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to propose that e-commerce\r\n\r\ndevelopment  initiatives  undertaken  by  SMEs  are  strongly\r\n\r\nsupported  by  the  Government,  and  that  such  support  be\r\n\r\nincorporated in current Government assistance schemes such as\r\n\r\nVTAS and LEFS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to facilitate speedy development and\r\n\r\nimplementation, several Government agencies such as the  IDA,\r\n\r\nEDB,  PSB,  NSTB, etc, should be identified to play catalytic\r\n\r\nand  lead roles in strategic e-commerce development projects,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  grooming of selected promising  SMEs  and  the\r\n\r\npromotion of adoption of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlocally available portals.  Their roles and activities should\r\n\r\nbe  coordinated to ensure efficient deployment  of  resources\r\n\r\nand no duplication of efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, recognising that only 4-5% of our local SMEs\r\n\r\ncurrently  adopt e-commerce, we should get more  SMEs  to  e-invent  themselves, and also set a target  for  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nnumber  of  SMEs  to  be using e-commerce in  their  business\r\n\r\nactivities  by a certain  period, say, about five years  from\r\n\r\nnow.   The  goal should be not only for our business entities\r\n\r\nto  use e-commerce as a tool, but also to get them to embrace\r\n\r\ne-commerce as an integral part of their business strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, under the Technopreneurship 21\r\n\r\nPlan,  the  Government has allocated US$1 billion to  promote\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship.  Recently, Deputy Prime Minister  Dr  Tony\r\n\r\nTan  announced that over half of this sum has been  committed\r\n\r\nfor  start-up companies and venture funds which promote  such\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship development in Singapore.  Dr Tan announced\r\n\r\nthat this investment fund will be fully invested by June, and\r\n\r\nthe Government is considering launching a second fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of the funding support from the Government\r\n\r\nand  the  drive  towards technopreneurship is being  felt  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As I have said earlier in my speech, in my recent\r\n\r\nmeetings  with  young founders and managers of several  local\r\n\r\nstart-up  companies, I can discern a strong sense of purpose,\r\n\r\ndrive   and  direction  amongst  them.   There  is  a  strong\r\n\r\nemergence  of  heightened energy level  amongst  these  young\r\n\r\npeople  who  ventured  to found new  start-up  companies.   I\r\n\r\nstrongly  feel that we should continue to harness and  propel\r\n\r\nthis  growing  energy by providing more funds,  more  support\r\n\r\nfacilities   such  as  incubation  centres  and  creating   a\r\n\r\nconducive  environment  where our  local  technopreneurs  can\r\n\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue with this Technopreneurship 21 drive, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  suggest that the Government should  allocate\r\n\r\nmore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoney,  say,  another  US$500 million or  even  a  full  US$1\r\n\r\nbillion  towards  the  new Technopreneurship  programme.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  instead  of  channelling  the  new  funds  to  the\r\n\r\nexisting   two  agencies,  ie,  the  National   Science   and\r\n\r\nTechnology  Board  (NSTB) and the GIC, to  allocate  out  the\r\n\r\nfunds,  I  would like to suggest that some part  of  the  new\r\n\r\nfunds  be  assigned  to  a third agency  which  has  a  large\r\n\r\nproportion  of  private-sector trained executives  to  be  in\r\n\r\ncharge.   The two existing agencies, NSTB and GIC, have  done\r\n\r\nan  excellent job.  The idea of a third body to  have  a  new\r\n\r\nhigh  number of private sector staff agency, maybe a new one,\r\n\r\nwould serve as a third body to provide more avenues for start-up companies and technopreneurs to seek funding support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the Budget debate, I also proposed that\r\n\r\npioneer  status, ie, five years' tax free status, be accorded\r\n\r\nto start-up companies.  These companies are pioneers in their\r\n\r\nown field such as info-com and biotechnology, and they should\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged.   They  will form a new  wave  of  pioneering\r\n\r\nchanges in upgrading the industrial development of Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir,  I am particularly keen on this idea of a pioneer status\r\n\r\nfor  high-tech  start-up  companies,  not  so  much  for  the\r\n\r\nincentive  as not many of them will make money in  the  first\r\n\r\nfive years to enjoy this tax benefit, but for the recognition\r\n\r\nthat  we  give  to  them,  and  in  the  process  create   an\r\n\r\nenvironment  whereby more high-tech companies are  encouraged\r\n\r\nto  be  formed,  just like in the early days  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nindustrial  development, pioneer companies  were  given  this\r\n\r\nspecial status.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the proposed additional fund and a\r\n\r\nthird  agency  to  channel through  the  funds  and  awarding\r\n\r\npioneer status to selective start-up companies will serve  to\r\n\r\ngive another boost to Singapore's technopreneurship plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, as part of giving the promotion\r\n\r\nof  technopreneurship a shot in the arm,  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nestablishing  a Science Hub.  For the Science  Hub  to  fully\r\n\r\nrealise  our objectives, the least of which is to  provide  a\r\n\r\nconducive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  vibrant  environment  for the  nurturing  of  knowledge-intensive capabilities, I would like to ask the Minister what\r\n\r\neconomic model would be used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am especially interested in how the Government will\r\n\r\ndrive this effort as there are multi-faceted needs to be met,\r\n\r\nsuch  as nurturing, social and leisure requirements,  if  one\r\n\r\nwere to use the Silicon Valley as a model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nindicate what the concentrations are likely to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the Technopreneurship 21\r\n\r\nCommittee launched by the Government is one excellent example\r\n\r\nof  how the Government and the private sector can play  their\r\n\r\npart    in    trying   to   promote   entrepreneurship    and\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship  in Singapore.  Today,  in  the  knowledge-based  economy (KBE), Singapore, more than at any time before\r\n\r\nin its history, has a best chance to compete with the world's\r\n\r\nbest countries on a level playing field.  We have no lack  of\r\n\r\nideas and talent but we need a more conducive environment and\r\n\r\nmotivation  factors that can be created  by both  the  public\r\n\r\nand  the private sectors.  While I am not advocating too much\r\n\r\nof  Government  interference, I do feel that  in  making  the\r\n\r\ntransition from a paternalistic approach of governance to one\r\n\r\nof an entrepreneurial governance, the Government can become a\r\n\r\ncatalyst and a facilitator, and once we have taken off,  they\r\n\r\nshould take a few steps back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Science and Technology Board's role needs\r\n\r\nto  be  one  of  a facilitator and incubator, and  perhaps  a\r\n\r\nfunding  agency  to  do  well in promoting  entrepreneurship,\r\n\r\nrather  than being the main driving force.  The NSTB,  to  do\r\n\r\nthis  role  effectively, will need to hire as  many  industry\r\n\r\nexperienced  people as possible, so that it can be  effective\r\n\r\nin executing its role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the governance with a lighter touch will help\r\n\r\nus create a more conducive environment.  I have heard of many\r\n\r\ncases of restrictive Government practices\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  the  sub-letting of JTC and HDB premises, the  Building\r\n\r\nand   Control  Authority's  and  the  Fire  Safety   Bureau's\r\n\r\nstringent   requirements  and  restrictions  make   it   very\r\n\r\ndifficult for setting up such offices, especially for a small\r\n\r\ngroup  of  entrepreneurs who need to spend more time focusing\r\n\r\non  the real value added activities.  But sometimes they  get\r\n\r\ndistracted  in  trying to fulfill the  requirements  of  such\r\n\r\nagencies, and this is really a waste of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the proposed Science Hub at Buona Vista is an\r\n\r\nexcellent   start  of  how  we  can  create  this   conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment.  And I suggest that in this Hub, we should allow\r\n\r\nsome  amount of untidiness, some chaos and practise  as  much\r\n\r\nflexibility  as  possible,  as compared  to  what  we  cannot\r\n\r\npractise out in Singapore, in general.  We should try to,  as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  possible,  duplicate the  Silicon  Valley  type  of\r\n\r\nenvironment in this area.  In fact, once we have learned from\r\n\r\nthe  Buona Vista Science Hub, I think we can afford  to  make\r\n\r\nthe  whole  of Singapore a science hub where we can  practise\r\n\r\nall  of  the  things that we have learned from  Buona  Vista.\r\n\r\nThis is one way that we can become the Silicon Valley of  the\r\n\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, to support the Industry 21 programme which the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board announced last  year,  I  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  we  set  up permanent industry groupings.   Instead  of\r\n\r\nrelying on ad hoc groups, I believe that if we have permanent\r\n\r\nindustry groupings, this should allow us to focus a lot  more\r\n\r\non  the  various sectors that we want to promote.   I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  these  permanent  groupings be funded  jointly  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  private sector,  and  through  this,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  a  more  focused approach will help  us  succeed  in\r\n\r\nachieving the Industry 21 programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, to promote more cottage industries, I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  we  liberalise  the  use of HDB  shophouses  for  info-communications type of companies.  This can be  an  extension\r\n\r\nof the home-office scheme\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we have implemented recently.  In my opinion, this will\r\n\r\nmake our housing estates more vibrant, allow entrepreneurs to\r\n\r\nhave  their  offices  near their homes, and  also  become  an\r\n\r\nintegral  part of the community where they work.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthis  will  also help alleviate the problem of excess  retail\r\n\r\nspace that we are facing in our housing estates today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, to bring in more talent has always been a big\r\n\r\nissue  for  Singapore.   I  would like  to  ask  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  willing  to consider setting  up  centres  of\r\n\r\nexcellence  in  a  few  countries,  like  in  India,   China,\r\n\r\nPhilippines,  Thailand, the USA and  a  few  other  countries\r\n\r\naround the world, where some of our activities, whether it is\r\n\r\nprivate sector or Government activities, can be outsourced to\r\n\r\nthese areas.  And these are the areas where we can groom  and\r\n\r\nidentify  talent who could in turn flow back into  Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  will  have a better chance of attracting the best  talent\r\n\r\nthis way and, at the same time, have access to as much and to\r\n\r\na bigger pool of people as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, we need to strengthen the generation,\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  the  use  of  intellectual  property  as  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive tool in promoting our high-technology industries.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  I believe that we do not have enough intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty lawyers nor a strong infrastructure to support  this\r\n\r\nimportant  area.   And I think we need  to  spend  some  time\r\n\r\ndeveloping this if we are very serious about starting up many\r\n\r\nmore technology companies in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Very quickly, the mega-merger  of  AOL and Time Warner was eclipsed by the Vodafone-Mannesman mega-merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the merger of the two banking giants of\r\n\r\nDBS  and  POSB  became history with the  merger  of  SIA  and\r\n\r\nVirgin,  a  merger  of sorts.

In\r\n\r\nthe  OECD  countries, monopolies are theoretically prohibited\r\n\r\nby  anti-trust and anti-monopoly laws.  The philosophy behind\r\n\r\nthese  laws date back to the 1930s, when big was regarded  as\r\n\r\nbad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monopolies and cartels are bad for the consumer, because\r\n\r\nof  their  power to control prices and manipulate markets  to\r\n\r\nthe  great inconvenience and disadvantage of the consumer and\r\n\r\nsmaller  businesses.   This is particularly  so  in  consumer\r\n\r\nproducts  and  services which for the most part  function  in\r\n\r\nimperfect  and  captive  markets.  Hence,  the  Internet  and\r\n\r\nglobal  competition will ensure that the power  of  localised\r\n\r\nmonopolies  is  reduced or nullified.  This  is  because  the\r\n\r\nInternet  allows  the consumer to buy not just  from  MPH  or\r\n\r\nTimes   Bookshop,   but  also  from  BarnesandNoble.com   and\r\n\r\nAmazon.com.  It allows the consumer to get information  about\r\n\r\nprices,  quality  and availability of products  and  services\r\n\r\nmore readily and thus makes for a more perfect market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this brave new world, it becomes increasingly\r\n\r\ndifficult to enforce or to justify laws regulating monopolies\r\n\r\nand   cartels.    Even   countries  with  supposedly   strict\r\n\r\ncompetition  laws  close an eye to the realities  which  have\r\n\r\nresulted  in the mega-mergers I have mentioned and  to  those\r\n\r\nlike  DaimlerChrysler, PriceWaterhouseCoopers  and  the  Citi\r\n\r\nGroup.    In   this   light,   it   will   be   fundamentally\r\n\r\nanachronistic,  it  would seem,  to ask for  laws  protecting\r\n\r\nconsumers from monopolies and cartels.  But I shall try.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make a case, Sir, for limited regulation in\r\n\r\nsituations where the market is effectively closed; the market\r\n\r\nfor petrol\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, for example, or the market for household goods\r\n\r\nand  consumer equipment.  Then there are the public transport\r\n\r\nand  public  utility  sectors.  In these  situations,  market\r\n\r\ndominance is still possible because the consumer has no  real\r\n\r\nchoice when it comes to alternatives.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy, of course, that in public transport and\r\n\r\nutilities, the monopolies, duopolies and cartels are  closely\r\n\r\nmonitored by the regulators - who indeed are also looking  to\r\n\r\ncreate  competition wherever they can.  Witness the  telecoms\r\n\r\nand  the  power supply industries, and the beginning of  free\r\n\r\ncompetition in public transport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deregulating and liberalising previously closed sectors\r\n\r\nis not good enough, Sir.  Closed markets cause our businesses\r\n\r\nto  be  complacent and cumbersomely inefficient, stifle their\r\n\r\ngrowth  and  hamper their ability to survive  in  the  global\r\n\r\neconomy.   Look at our banking industry and legal profession,\r\n\r\nfor example.  Hence the beginnings of change there also.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to urge the Ministry to look into monopolistic\r\n\r\nconduct  and  business practices and make these illegal.   We\r\n\r\nmay  not break up our relatively small companies in the  name\r\n\r\nof  competition  but  we certainly can discourage  them  from\r\n\r\nunconscionable  conduct.  Much  of  this  market   unfriendly\r\n\r\nconduct  may  even  look innocuous.  A  market  leader  could\r\n\r\nresort  to  predatory pricing to kill off  competitors,  deny\r\n\r\naccess  to smaller competitor on the pretext of its inability\r\n\r\nto  pay on time; collect deposits from customers on all sorts\r\n\r\nof pretexts and not return the money promptly or at all; clog\r\n\r\nup competitors' distribution channels with massive numbers of\r\n\r\nsmall purchases; set so-called recommended retail prices with\r\n\r\nsevere  contractual penalties for breach of  that  price;  or\r\n\r\nquietly collude with other service or goods providers  in  an\r\n\r\nunwritten pact, therefore no evidence, which obliges them  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  the  same price levels whatever the  true  economic\r\n\r\ncosts of doing business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not hypothetical situations. They have\r\n\r\nactually all happened in recent months and even for years  on\r\n\r\nend   -   in   the   telecoms  industry,   petrol   stations,\r\n\r\nsupermarkets, car dealers, the list goes on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when are we going to stop closing an eye to such\r\n\r\ninequity?   These situations can be nipped in the bud  if  we\r\n\r\nhad  a Fair Trading Act.  CASE will be submitting a paper  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry on such an Act after our visit to Australia and\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand  in  May.  We will bring a  team  of  consumers,\r\n\r\nbusinessmen   and  officials  to  observe  the   impact   and\r\n\r\neffectiveness of such a law and make recommendations  on  our\r\n\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will give the paper careful\r\n\r\nconsideration when it is submitted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, much has been said already in\r\n\r\nthis  House about the role of Government-linked companies  or\r\n\r\nGLCs  in  driving economic growth in Singapore.   Also,  many\r\n\r\nMembers,  including myself, have exhorted the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconstantly  review and identify candidates for  privatisation\r\n\r\nwhere private sector pressures would make sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst privatisation may provide the best models in many\r\n\r\ncases,  GLCs  who prove their worth can continue  to  justify\r\n\r\ntheir existence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, GLCs may well be a good intermediate step or\r\n\r\nmodel  for  certain Government-run operations.  Specifically,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should review the extent to which  sea  port\r\n\r\nservices  should  be deregulated and whether  certain  ports,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Jurong  Port which supports the  Jurong  industrial\r\n\r\nestate,  should be corporatised or even privatised.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister to comment on the feasibility  of\r\n\r\nsuch a transition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, competition and the free market\r\n\r\nrepresent  an  important  ideological  underpinning  of   our\r\n\r\nsociety.  It is a trite statement to say that competition\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallows  for greater variety and therefore freedom  of  choice\r\n\r\nfor  the consumers in the market place.  Without competition,\r\n\r\na wide array of goods and services  available to the consumer\r\n\r\nwould  not  have  been  possible.   Until  recently,  we  are\r\n\r\nconfronted  with an alternative choice to the free  market  - the  command  economy.  We have seen that  command  economies\r\n\r\nproduce excesses that result in great inefficiencies  in  the\r\n\r\nmarket place.  Someone once joked that the East Germans under\r\n\r\nthe communist regime, could only choose between a red Trabant\r\n\r\nor  a  white  Trabant,  a  three piston  car  with  polluting\r\n\r\nexhausts.  I will not be surprised if that were true.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, Sir, free competition without regulation also\r\n\r\nproduces  excesses. Starting from the premise  that  not  all\r\n\r\nfirms are of equal ability, extreme competition would feed on\r\n\r\nthe  predatory instincts of businesses seeking to survive  in\r\n\r\nthe  market  place.  Just as in the natural world,  only  the\r\n\r\nstrongest  will survive and the weaker ones will perish  into\r\n\r\noblivion.  What happens is perhaps a growing dominance of the\r\n\r\nmarket  place by a few major producers of goods and services.\r\n\r\nIn  the  hands  of these few major producers or  even  single\r\n\r\nproducer  of  goods and services, the consumer is  left  very\r\n\r\nmuch at their mercy because of their extensive power over the\r\n\r\nprice which they charge for their goods and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is for this reason that many countries in the\r\n\r\nWest have passed laws that regulate against the formation  of\r\n\r\nmonopolies  or cartels and anti-competitive practices.   Such\r\n\r\nentities are, by its tendency, an antithesis to this idea  of\r\n\r\nfreedom of choice for the consumer.  The Americans understood\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  of the market early and have  since  the  19th\r\n\r\ncentury  enacted such legislation as the Sherman Act and  the\r\n\r\nClayton  Act and other legislation.  Many European countries,\r\n\r\nincluding Australia, have also adopted similar legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore becomes a mature economy, it is perhaps\r\n\r\ntimely that the Government should look to comprehensive anti-trust laws to check against\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  excesses  of firms that dominate the market  place.  The\r\n\r\nadvantage  of these policies is obvious.  Recently,  we  have\r\n\r\nseen  that  as  a  result of competition, overseas  telephone\r\n\r\ncharges began to fall dramatically.  As another example, when\r\n\r\nStarHub introduced free Internet services in a bid to attract\r\n\r\nsubscribers.    Almost  overnight,  another  rival   Internet\r\n\r\nservice provider responded by offering free services as well.\r\n\r\nThe  move  by  the  ISP  to  save customer  accounts  is  not\r\n\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, it is not seen by many as a sincere move on its\r\n\r\npart to provide best service for its customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that the IDA plays the role of\r\n\r\nregulator  in checking, amongst other things, the competition\r\n\r\namong  telecommunication  companies.  However,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nwatchdog body like IDA with respect to the other parts of the\r\n\r\nindustry at the market place.  One question that I would like\r\n\r\nto ask the Minister therefore is whether the Government would\r\n\r\nseriously  consider introducing legislation  like  the  anti-trust  laws  which  are applicable in the United  States  and\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the support for small and\r\n\r\nmedium  enterprises (SMEs) has always been a topic  discussed\r\n\r\nby  many  Members in this House.  The real issue is  that  we\r\n\r\nhave not been able to find the right formula to help our SMEs\r\n\r\neffectively.   The  many  schemes  available  are  not  fully\r\n\r\nbenefitting  the smaller companies and we need to  relook  at\r\n\r\nhow   best   to   incentivise  such  companies.   While   the\r\n\r\nProductivity and Standards Board (PSB) is working hard at it,\r\n\r\nI believe there is a serious misalignment of the needs versus\r\n\r\nthe help available for such SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SME 21 is a good plan but, in my opinion, the\r\n\r\nimplementation is not going to be easy and we may end up with\r\n\r\njust  incremental  changes but what we really  need  is  some\r\n\r\nrevolutionary  changes if we are serious about creating  many\r\n\r\nmore world class companies out of these SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, we need an EDB-style organisation which\r\n\r\nis able to grant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincentives  like pioneer status or other incentives  that  Mr\r\n\r\nOng  has talked about earlier on.  This agency should,  first\r\n\r\nof  all,  have  a focused look at growing local  world  class\r\n\r\ncompanies  while  EBD  should continue  to  focus  on  multi-national companies.  In my opinion, with the current set  up,\r\n\r\nthe EDB cannot effectively focus on both sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such an organisation will also have the flexibility to\r\n\r\nselect, groom and help grow companies from the start-up stage\r\n\r\nto  the  time they become world class companies  or  MNCs  in\r\n\r\ntheir own right.  Such an approach where some agencies follow\r\n\r\nthe  life  cycles of a company will allow faster  action  and\r\n\r\nsupport  to  the  specific needs of such companies.   Because\r\n\r\nsuch agencies will know the needs of such company well having\r\n\r\nfollowed them throughout their life cycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in my opinion, the selection criterion for\r\n\r\npromising local enterprises is outdated.  The question I have\r\n\r\nfor  the  Minister is, how many of these PLEs  have,  in  the\r\n\r\npast, actually made it as world class companies and in return\r\n\r\nhow  many  of  the  world class companies that  come  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  were  identified as PLEs  before.   I  suggest  we\r\n\r\ninduct  the private sector to help determine and choose  PLEs\r\n\r\nfor  these  Government agencies.  This is an example  of  the\r\n\r\noutsourcing of Government of Singapore to the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point of time, we need the focus agencies to\r\n\r\nnurture,  groom, grow, guide and launch local companies  into\r\n\r\nthe  global market place if we are serious about creating the\r\n\r\n100  or  so  world-class companies that we talked about  last\r\n\r\nyear.    So  my  previous  suggestion  of  these  independent\r\n\r\norganisations should be considered seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest we spin off the PSB or part of PSB into a\r\n\r\njointly  managed consortium managed by both the  private  and\r\n\r\npublic  sectors with complete independence of management  but\r\n\r\nperhaps guided by a board consisting of people from both  the\r\n\r\npublic  and  private sectors to provide strategic  direction.\r\n\r\nThis can be jointly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunded  again by the public and private sectors and there  is\r\n\r\nan organisation called the SEMATECH in the USA.  With such an\r\n\r\nindependent  body, the SME 21 will have a much better  chance\r\n\r\nof  success  because of the direct private sector involvement\r\n\r\nto allow faster decisions to be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that we devise some incentives to\r\n\r\nencourage the merger and consolidation of our SMEs.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthem  may not be able to operate, given their small size  and\r\n\r\ninefficiencies they may have.  The feedback that  I  have  is\r\n\r\nthat   current  regulations  in  Singapore  create  too  many\r\n\r\nobstacles for companies to merge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, while many things have been said about the\r\n\r\npractices of GLCs, I do however feel that the GLCs  can  play\r\n\r\nan   important   role   if  they  are  privatised   and   run\r\n\r\nindependently.   GLCs could also partner our local  SMEs  for\r\n\r\nglobal  projects as is being done by a number  of  countries,\r\n\r\nfor example, in the UK and Japan.\r\n\r\nGLCs should therefore be given appropriate incentives to help\r\n\r\nsuch  SMEs  to secure overseas business together  with  their\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nshare  a  lot  of  the views expressed by Mr  Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nearlier.  I want to go into some practical points but, first,\r\n\r\nin my view, SMEs today face very exciting challenges but very\r\n\r\nfrustrating problems also.  Exciting challenges in the  sense\r\n\r\nthat  never before have they been able to see lower  barriers\r\n\r\nof  entry.  Technology and Internet allow them to open  their\r\n\r\nmarket  and allow them to  make network and connections  with\r\n\r\nmany  people  in  the  world without  even  having  to  leave\r\n\r\nSingapore.   But  what is very frustrating to  them  is  that\r\n\r\nthere is a great demand for intellectual capacity for them to\r\n\r\ntake  advantage just presented before them. That is for  many\r\n\r\nreasons.  But  one of the reasons is that in Singapore,  when\r\n\r\nyou  start to compete with the best and the brightest in  the\r\n\r\nworld,  you are faced with great odds.  Because in  Singapore\r\n\r\nthe best\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the brightest join the Government.  Maybe the second-best\r\n\r\njoin  the  MNCs  and then you are left with a  very  deprived\r\n\r\nintellectual pool in the SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you want to go into very high leading edge\r\n\r\npractices, sometimes it is very difficult.  This is  where  I\r\n\r\nfeel  we  can  do a lot more to help them because  while  the\r\n\r\nworkers  can do many things, they can get new graduates  from\r\n\r\nthe  universities and polytechnics, it is the leaders of  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  themselves that must keep up with  the  speed  and\r\n\r\nchanges in the economy.  I see the case of Hewlett Packard in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and they have spawned many public-listed companies\r\n\r\nlike Omni Industries, Venture and NatSteel and so on, because\r\n\r\nwhen they start to outsource business to these people they do\r\n\r\ntake  a  personal stake in these companies in the sense  that\r\n\r\nthey get their engineers and their planners to be involved in\r\n\r\nthe  entire outsourcing process.  So they are not  just  some\r\n\r\nsub-contractors  but  they  are  themselves   investors   and\r\n\r\npersonally  involved in this.  They have spawned  world-class\r\n\r\ncompanies like Venture, NatSteel in the world.  This is where\r\n\r\na  working model is available in Singapore.  So they can have\r\n\r\nlarge  GLCs. They get business and give it to sub-contractors\r\n\r\nand some MNCs complain, \"I can do what the GLCs can do except\r\n\r\nthat  I do not have a name like GLC.\"  To overcome this, what\r\n\r\nwe could do is GLCs starting to take an interest and stake in\r\n\r\nsmall companies, take it through mergers and acquisition.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way, you tap on the entrepreneurial skill but  you  can\r\n\r\nalso  help  translate leading edge technologies and practices\r\n\r\nthat are available to GLCs to these small companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing that perhaps we can do is that at the\r\n\r\ncentres  where  there  is  a lot of leading  edge,  like  the\r\n\r\nuniversities  and the polytechnics, we should encourage  more\r\n\r\nof that to get out and work directly with some of these small\r\n\r\ncompanies.  These small companies sometimes find it very hard\r\n\r\nto  invest  in training.  They do not train as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nMNCs.   But if you can tap on to the R&D of universities  and\r\n\r\npolytechnics and get these academics to work\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  areas  other than business, in engineering  or  in  other\r\n\r\nresearch work, we can avail these best practices to small and\r\n\r\nmedium  enterprises, otherwise they may not be able to afford\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think GLCs can also benefit because one of the things\r\n\r\nthat may be problematic in the future is that as GLCs try and\r\n\r\ngo  into the region, how they are perceived by people in  the\r\n\r\nregion may be problematic because they do not just see  their\r\n\r\ncommercial presence but they see the Singapore entity  behind\r\n\r\nit  and  people are very nationalistic. They may not  welcome\r\n\r\nsome   GLCs.   If  you  could  collaborate,  bring  in   more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  to be involved in some of these  projects,  we\r\n\r\ncan buffer some of the nationalistic sentiments that some  of\r\n\r\nthese  countries  may respond to when Singapore  Incorporated\r\n\r\ntries  to  expand to the region. Certainly, I share  with  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh the other incentives that we need to offer  in\r\n\r\nterms of taxation and incentives to provide training to these\r\n\r\ncompanies.  I say again that training is not just  for  those\r\n\r\nwho  are  already at risk.  New technologies are  putting  at\r\n\r\nrisk  a  whole host of people who may not be aware that  they\r\n\r\nare  at risk today, but certainly it will be too late by  the\r\n\r\ntime  companies  start to move out.  By  the  time  companies\r\n\r\nstart  to  move out, they find themselves completely  out  of\r\n\r\nsync with the needs of the economy and technology.\r\n\r\n<br>6.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think we need to really look far ahead and see who\r\n\r\nare  the people - the receptionists, the tellers, the  little\r\n\r\nmanagers  -  who  will  be  made  virtually  extinct  by  new\r\n\r\ntechnologies.  How do we help them before they really  become\r\n\r\nvirtually  extinct  or  redundant?  This  is  where  I  think\r\n\r\nfurther  collaboration and specific attention given to  SMEs,\r\n\r\nunderstanding their weaknesses, can help.  GLCs  can  play  a\r\n\r\ngreat part here to help SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister could give some attention and direct\r\n\r\nsome resources to help these SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, the recent launch of SME 21\r\n\r\nand its broad range of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrategies and programmes appear poised to well position  our\r\n\r\nSMEs  in  the  21st century.  In fact, the  SME  21  document\r\n\r\ndistributed  during  the launch is so well  regarded  that  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it  is  officially requested  by  many  countries\r\n\r\nworldwide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I believe, while the ideas and strategies\r\n\r\nhave  been  well conceived, there was no reference  whosoever\r\n\r\nbeing made to benchmarking or learning from the experience of\r\n\r\nothers.   I am not suggesting that this is not already  being\r\n\r\ndone,  but  I  am  sure  we  are  aware  of  the  merits   of\r\n\r\nbenchmarking  against  others, in this  case,  against  other\r\n\r\ncountries which are more experienced and are ahead of  us  in\r\n\r\npromoting  SMEs.  In the United Kingdom, for  example,  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  more than 3.7 million enterprises, of which  only\r\n\r\n7,000  are  large  establishments,  the  government  acts  as\r\n\r\ncatalyst    to   encourage   collaboration   for   corrective\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  As a result, one in 10 SMEs is able to  set\r\n\r\naside 10% or more of their sales turnover on new products and\r\n\r\nprocess development.  Australia is quite ahead in government-led  strategies  to tap the vast potential of  e-commerce  by\r\n\r\ncreating    a   dynamic   business   environment,   promoting\r\n\r\ntransactions  via  the Internet, and also conducting  regular\r\n\r\ndialogues  with  the  business community to  discuss  on-line\r\n\r\nbusiness  issues.   Taiwan and Korea,  while  having  a  more\r\n\r\nliberalised  business environment, implement  policies  which\r\n\r\nare   designed  to  strengthen  the  quality  framework   and\r\n\r\ntechnological competitiveness of their SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although some strategies adopted by these countries\r\n\r\nmay  be  unique  to  their local and specific  situations,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve many are also generic and applicable as well  to  us.\r\n\r\nI  would  therefore like to urge the Minister for  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  to  consider  putting  in  place  a  barometer   to\r\n\r\nbenchmark  ourselves against what some of  the  best  in  the\r\n\r\nworld are doing to promote SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, the SME 21 is a comprehensive\r\n\r\neffort  to  develop  the  role and  contribution  of  smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies to the growth of Singapore.  At the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame  time,  it  also  addresses the issues  that  vulnerable\r\n\r\nsectors,  such  as retail and construction,  are  facing  and\r\n\r\nrecommends   some  strategies  for  survival,  for   example,\r\n\r\nconsolidation  for  small operators to achieve  economies  of\r\n\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, as my colleagues Mr Singh and Mr Magad have\r\n\r\nobserved,  we know that whilst a lot of effort has gone  into\r\n\r\nformulating the blueprint, it is the follow-up, in  terms  of\r\n\r\nrendering  actual assistance to target SMEs, that  will  make\r\n\r\nthe difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how the relevant\r\n\r\nagencies can proactively help such vulnerable businesses.  In\r\n\r\nparticular,  will  their efforts extend to the  neighbourhood\r\n\r\nshop   operators,   especially  those  who  are   non-English\r\n\r\nspeaking, or who may be unaware of the existence of  the  SME\r\n\r\n21  altogether?   Sir, many neighbourhood operators may  have\r\n\r\nbeen  running  chronic losses but still  feel  they  have  no\r\n\r\nalternatives.   For  such  operators,  where   cessation   of\r\n\r\nbusiness  could well be the only solution, can placement  and\r\n\r\nretraining assistance be extended as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, based on its\r\n\r\nDesired  Outcomes, the Ministry of Trade and Industry appears\r\n\r\nto  be  only interested in nurturing only the more successful\r\n\r\nlocal  enterprises and forging a strong partnership with  the\r\n\r\nMNCs.  If this is its main direction, how could we expect MTI\r\n\r\nto  channel adequate resources to give priority attention  to\r\n\r\nachieving  the aim of the SME 21, which is to  build  up  the\r\n\r\ncapability of the SMEs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMEs are indigenous to Singapore and are important\r\n\r\nconstituents  of  the Singapore economy.   The  SME  21  plan\r\n\r\nlaunched  in  January has given due recognition to  this  and\r\n\r\nwants  to  make a concerted effort to assist SMEs  keep  pace\r\n\r\nwith  the  rest  of  the economy as a critical  part  of  the\r\n\r\nnational plan to sustain Singapore's economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given its importance, I feel that this should have been\r\n\r\ngiven and reflected\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  Budget Statement or budget provision  for  MTI.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  is not a single provision for the promotion  of\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of SME 21 in the Budget.  How  could  the\r\n\r\nlocal  business community react positively to the  objectives\r\n\r\nof  the SME 21 without a very clear and strong commitment  on\r\n\r\nthe part of MTI?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the lower-income group among the heartlanders in\r\n\r\nHDB  estates,  who  have been assisted  to  move  on  to  the\r\n\r\nmainstream  of life through substantial help and  support  by\r\n\r\nboth  the Government and the community, the SMEs who  can  be\r\n\r\nclassified  as  the  lower-income group  in  the  competitive\r\n\r\nbusiness  world,  would also require greater  care  and  help\r\n\r\nbefore  they can be singled out as successful enterprises  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  right, and thereon to be nurtured as  world-class\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In forging a strong partnership with MNCs, the\r\n\r\nGovernment ought to guard against creating a misconception of\r\n\r\nfavouring  the  MNCs at the expense of our  indigenous  SMEs.\r\n\r\nThe  Government must find ways and means to encourage or  get\r\n\r\nour  MNCs, as well as GLCs, to contribute their part  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral well-being of the local business community, with  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  objective  of creating a pro-business  environment\r\n\r\nfor all enterprises in Singapore, both big and small.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MNCs and GLCs have ample resources with the\r\n\r\nfacilities,  direct access to information  or  even  relevant\r\n\r\nauthorities  for their business operation and expansion.   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  they  do  not  feel the compelling  need  to  join  or\r\n\r\ncontribute to the local trade and industry associations.   On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, many of our trade and industry associations\r\n\r\nexist  to  serve  the needs of SMEs.  And  with  the  limited\r\n\r\nmembership  dues collected, they find it extremely  difficult\r\n\r\nto make a strong commitment of their limited resources to the\r\n\r\nimplementation of any national economic plans such as the SME\r\n\r\n21,  or  even  to promote IT applications among the  SMEs  in\r\n\r\nsupport of Singapore's IT plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation calls for Government funding as well as\r\n\r\nmore voluntary or even\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmandatory  contribution of resources from the MNCs and  GLCs,\r\n\r\nand even our very successful local enterprises, to enable our\r\n\r\nlocal  trade  and  industry associations to draw  up  various\r\n\r\nschemes  and  programmes to effectively service the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity.   I  therefore  urge  the  Ministry  to  take  the\r\n\r\ninitiative,  together  with  the  major  trade  and  industry\r\n\r\nassociations,  to  draw up some concrete measures,  including\r\n\r\ncertain  financial and technical assistance schemes  for  the\r\n\r\nSMEs  and  their  trade associations as a  big  step  towards\r\n\r\nbuilding a vibrant, resilient and cohesive business community\r\n\r\nwhere  all enterprises, big and small, can contribute to  the\r\n\r\ngrowth of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ong Kian Min is not here. Mr Ahmad\r\n\r\nMagad.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Sir, much has been spoken in the\r\n\r\nlast several days and today about the importance of promoting\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  and technopreneurship as  one  of  the  key\r\n\r\nactivities  for  Singapore  to  focus  on.   We  need  a  new\r\n\r\ngeneration of home-bred wealth and value creators  who  could\r\n\r\nplay  a meaningful role in continually improving the standard\r\n\r\nof living of Singaporeans as we hop on the global stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awareness created and the many schemes we have put\r\n\r\nin place have encouraged many younger Singaporeans to want to\r\n\r\njump  on the bandwagon.  However, as adrenalin begins to flow\r\n\r\nand  ideas  begin to sparkle, many are discovering  to  their\r\n\r\ndismay  that funds availability represents a major  stumbling\r\n\r\nblock to execute and market their ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that we consider setting up an\r\n\r\nagency  where  technopreneurs and high-tech  aspirants  could\r\n\r\nreadily  come  to  and  meet  with  venture  capitalists  and\r\n\r\ninterested  angel investors who, at the same time,  are  also\r\n\r\nlooking  for investment opportunities.  The agency's  primary\r\n\r\nactivity  is  to  marry ideas which could potentially  strike\r\n\r\nbig,  with funds to bring the ideas into reality.  I envision\r\n\r\nan  agency,  Sir,  where the technopreneur aspirants  present\r\n\r\ntheir ideas and business\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplans  to  interested investors where technopreneur marriages\r\n\r\nare solemnised and hopefully live happily ever after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously, Sir, I believe the availability of such an\r\n\r\nagency would help to increase the momentum of entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nactivities.   To  widen  its  scope,  such  an  agency  could\r\n\r\nsimultaneously  act as a one-stop agency for SMEs  to  obtain\r\n\r\ninformation  on  the  multitude  of  Government's  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes and other forms of help available for both new start-ups and existing entrepreneurs to grow their business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, there is a perception that the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Economic Development Board are  no  longer\r\n\r\nconsidering  trading  as an important  economic  activity  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   In fact, I have heard a number of  good  traders\r\n\r\nwho actually have left Singapore for trading cities like Hong\r\n\r\nKong  and  Dubai,  citing cost, support  and  also  financing\r\n\r\nability as reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, for us to promote the e-commerce industry\r\n\r\nin the future, the trading community actually can play a very\r\n\r\nimportant role to promote this concept of a click and  mortar\r\n\r\nconcept  where the traditional businesses are made  efficient\r\n\r\nby  the  use of information technology to compete effectively\r\n\r\nin  the  world  arena.  The traders probably,  having  traded\r\n\r\naround the world, are the best people to promote this portion\r\n\r\nof the growth that we want in the Internet economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, I also spoke about possibilities of\r\n\r\nimplementing  trade financing schemes, similar  to  the  LEFS\r\n\r\nscheme  for  the  manufacturing sector.   After  speaking  in\r\n\r\nParliament  last year, I discussed some potential  approaches\r\n\r\nwith the Trade Development Board officers.  I think they have\r\n\r\ncome up with some possible plans. And I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he will consider implementing them  because\r\n\r\nthese plans will not incur too much of Government funds.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  we need is for someone to get it started and, I  think,\r\n\r\nif  it  has  started, the Government can  take  a  step  back\r\n\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  will run by itself - run by the private  sector,\r\n\r\nthe banks and the insurance agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing I would like to talk about is trade\r\n\r\nexhibitions  and  shows.  I believe since 1994,  the  subsidy\r\n\r\ngiven  to  our  companies in attending shows and  exhibitions\r\n\r\noverseas has been reduced drastically from about 70% down  to\r\n\r\nabout  35%.   I  would like to ask the Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nincreasing this back again to around 55% and to fund some  of\r\n\r\nthe industry organisations, like the Chambers of Commerce, to\r\n\r\nactually help such companies attend such trade shows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe the infrastructure costs in Singapore\r\n\r\nstill  need  to  be  addressed.  PSA charges  are  still  not\r\n\r\ncompetitive compared to the best ports around the world, like\r\n\r\nin  Rotterdam.  Telecommunication charges are still an issue.\r\n\r\nIf they are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nserious about promoting this industry, we should look at  all\r\n\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is 7.00 pm now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon, Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the\r\n\r\nCommittee and took the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to report that the Committee\r\n\r\nof  Supply  has  made further progress on  the  Estimates  of\r\n\r\nExpenditure for the financial year 2000/2001, and  ask  leave\r\n\r\nto sit again tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Seven o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\u0000\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
