I was\r\n\r\nmerely  making  some general comment on  the  fact  that\r\n\r\ntoday  the  high state of respectability  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice of Singapore is held by a local man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to the extent that the present Chief Justice is a\r\n\r\nMalayan - more  so  a  Singaporean - we  are  happy.  It  is\r\n\r\nappropriate  though that we reflect this appointment  in\r\n\r\nthe  perspective of an independent Judiciary on which  I\r\n\r\npropose to elaborate under my next amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry to say that the appointment of Justice\r\n\r\nWee  Chong Jin as the Chief Justice has not created  the\r\n\r\njubilation that it should have, if not for anything else\r\n\r\nthen  at  least for the fact that it is the first  local\r\n\r\nappointment.  Sir, the discontent over this appointment,\r\n\r\nI am sure, is known to many. It is unlikely that Members\r\n\r\nof this House are not aware of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not for me to talk of the competence or\r\n\r\notherwise  of Justice Wee, but what is paramount  is  to\r\n\r\nstress  the  need  for a non-political approach  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to the Judiciary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is an open secret today that the appointment\r\n\r\nof  Justice  Wee is regarded as a political appointment.\r\n\r\nSir,   having  witnessed  the  conduct  of  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the last four years, it is not  difficult\r\n\r\nto  understand  the  legitimate  apprehension  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is capable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  making  the  law  courts P.A.P. law  courts.  It  is\r\n\r\nregrettable that the P.A.P. persists in converting State\r\n\r\ninstitutions into P.A.P. organs. Sir, the people  cannot\r\n\r\nplace  trust  on  justice  if  political  colouring   is\r\n\r\nintroduced  into the administration of  justice.  It  is\r\n\r\nneedless  for me to say that it will be a  sad  day  for\r\n\r\nSingapore if British colonial Chief Justices are  to  be\r\n\r\nreplaced by P.A.P.

Then I  am  quite\r\n\r\nprepared to have the matter investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Constitution, before the appointment is made\r\n\r\nby  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara, the Prime Minister  who\r\n\r\nhas  to  give  the  advice is obliged  to  con-suit  the\r\n\r\nretiring  Chief  Justice,  which  I  did.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nretiring  Chief Justice deemed it fit and proper  before\r\n\r\nhe  left the country to indicate what he thought of  the\r\n\r\nadvice  he gave me. I also took advice from all  members\r\n\r\nof  the  Bar Committee. Amongst the members I  consulted\r\n\r\nwas  the  Member  for Farrer Park. I  do  not  wish  any\r\n\r\njustification for the choice made, which I can  in  good\r\n\r\nconscience  say was the best that any Prime Minister  in\r\n\r\nmy  position could have done. The fact that  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  should have chosen in a  sly  way  to  try\r\n\r\nsomehow  to  bring discredit to an institution  of  some\r\n\r\nimportance in a democratic State without really  wishing\r\n\r\nto pursue the point is, I think, a sad reflection on the\r\n\r\nstandards  of the Opposition. Men who have not  got  the\r\n\r\ncourage  to  pursue  their allegations  publicly  should\r\n\r\ndesist from making sly and oblique references.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I merely wish to say this.

Sir,  under  the\r\n\r\nConstitution, the powers to appoint, promote or transfer\r\n\r\ndistrict  judges and magistrates is vested in the  Legal\r\n\r\nService Commission under section 93 of the Constitution,\r\n\r\npage 42. The Legal Service Commission consists of:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the Chief Justice;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the Chairman of the Public Service Commission;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) a Judge of the Supreme Court nominated\r\n\r\ngenerally or specially by the Chief Justice;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the State Advocate-General; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) not more than two members of the Public Service Commission nominated generally or specially\r\n\r\nby the Chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first of all, the Chief Justice is appointed by\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara in accordance with the advice\r\n\r\nof  the Prime Minister. For practical purposes, it means\r\n\r\nthat  he  must be a man of the Prime Minister's  choice;\r\n\r\nsecondly,  the Chairman of the Public Service Commission\r\n\r\nis  also  in the same manner appointed by the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  in accordance with the  advice  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister; thirdly, the State Advocate-General  is\r\n\r\nalso   appointed  in  the  same  manner.  The  remaining\r\n\r\nmembers, as has been pointed out, are appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nChief  Justice  and the Chairman of the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Legal Service Commission as constituted, as\r\n\r\nhas  been  explained, is a body which has the  authority\r\n\r\nfor  the  appointment,  promotion  or  transfer  of  all\r\n\r\ndistrict judges and magistrates. That is the first point\r\n\r\nthat  I  wish  to  make  in respect  of  the  manner  of\r\n\r\nappointment of Judges and magistrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is the current practice in the\r\n\r\nappointment  and transfer of district court  judges  and\r\n\r\nmagistrates. Art officer who is a magistrate  today  can\r\n\r\nbe  transferred  tomorrow  to  become  a  Deputy  Public\r\n\r\nProsecutor and vice versa. There are many examples:  one\r\n\r\noutstanding example is Mr Francis Seow Tiang  Siew.  He\r\n\r\nwas a D.P.P. at one Time: then he was transferred to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  district court judge for some months and now, Sir, he\r\n\r\nis  transferred once again to he a D.P.P.  Incidentally,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, Mr Francis Seow is a gold medallist,\r\n\r\nthough not in the Olympics, but in the legal service for\r\n\r\nhaving run the race well on behalf of the P.A.P.

He must not do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> All I wanted to point out was that he was\r\n\r\nawarded    the    Public   Administration   Medal - Pingat\r\n\r\nPentadbiran ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Those medals are awarded for\r\n\r\nconduct and therefore there is an indirect reflection on\r\n\r\nthe  officer's conduct. That must not be  done  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Very well, Mr Speaker, Sir, that was just\r\n\r\none  example. Then there are many other examples, and  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  propose  to  go  into  them  now.  But  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wants, I am quite prepared to list out a  few\r\n\r\nmore examples later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the practical effect of all this is that a\r\n\r\ndistrict   judge,   before  whom  the  Solicitor-General\r\n\r\nappears and whose conduct is subject to the authority of\r\n\r\nthe Judge, can one day be transferred and he expected to\r\n\r\nwork  under the Solicitor-General. Again. Sir, the other\r\n\r\nway  round. A Deputy Public Prosecutor, who works  under\r\n\r\nthe  Solicitor-General and takes instructions  from  him\r\n\r\ntoday,  may be transferred tomorrow to become a district\r\n\r\njudge  before  whom the Solicitor-General will  have  to\r\n\r\nappear.  I  am  quite sure the Government  Members  will\r\n\r\nagree  that there are very illustrious examples of  this\r\n\r\nto  be quoted. It is hardly necessary for me to say that\r\n\r\nthis practice puts the district judge or a magistrate in\r\n\r\nan  invidious position in the administration of justice,\r\n\r\nparticularly  too,  when  the Solicitor-General  himself\r\n\r\nappears in the courts. The least I can say is that  this\r\n\r\npractice  is  scandalous. Perhaps you will  recall  that\r\n\r\nthere was a case of a district judge who was transferred\r\n\r\nsoon after a particular case in which six trade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunionists were involved. Sir, some Members of this House\r\n\r\nhave   suggested   on  a  previous  occasion   that   an\r\n\r\nindependent   Judiciary  is  one  of  the   pillars   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  Sir,  there  is no  doubt  that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nlaudable acclamation, though it is regrettable  that  it\r\n\r\ncame  from  some  people who merely pay lip  service  to\r\n\r\ndemocratic  practices. The basis of my argument  is  not\r\n\r\ndemocracy  or  what have we. There is  no  democracy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   and  Singapore  is  hardly   a   democracy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, it would be futile to talk about pillars\r\n\r\nof    democracy.   I   hope   that   Members   of   this\r\n\r\nHouse - particularly  those  self-acclaimed  champions  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy sitting across the Floor - will forgive me if  I\r\n\r\nput  aside  democracies and pillars of  democracies  and\r\n\r\ntalk of hard reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the administration of justice, in our view, is\r\n\r\nthe   essence   of  a  civilised  human   society.   The\r\n\r\nindependence  of  the Judiciary is  a  fundamental  pre-requisite  for  the  administration of  justice,  as  it\r\n\r\nshould  be. Justice in one form or another has been  the\r\n\r\ncrux    of   struggle   in   human   society.   However,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  institutions for the  administration  of\r\n\r\njustice  have  been more often than not  instruments  of\r\n\r\noppression in the hands of the ruling class.  Today,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the P.A.P. takes honours for having  excelled\r\n\r\nin   the   use  of  State  organs  for  repression   and\r\n\r\noppression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, but for the aspersions that\r\n\r\nhave  been cast not upon me, but upon the Chief Justice,\r\n\r\nthe  State Advocate-General, the Chairman of the  P.S.C.\r\n\r\nand  a  whole  host of other appointments  made  by  me,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Speaker of this Chamber,  I  would  have\r\n\r\ndeemed  the  remarks  made by  the  Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\nbeneath comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the nature of things that somebody has to\r\n\r\nmake  an  appointment and in the new Constitution  which\r\n\r\ncame  into  operation in 1959. I inherited in my  office\r\n\r\nthe  powers of a Governor, the Chief Secretary  and  the\r\n\r\nMayor.  If  these powers, Mr Speaker, Sir, are  wrongly\r\n\r\nused,   then   the  institutions  of  the   State   will\r\n\r\ndisintegrate.  I  am proud to say that  at  least  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of the appointments made, housing has succeeded,\r\n\r\nthe Polytechnic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  expanding, the Public Utilities Board is well on its\r\n\r\nway  to being established, and a whole host of statutory\r\n\r\ncorporations, including the Singapore Harbour Board, are\r\n\r\nfunctioning efficiently, discharging their duties to the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  But  to suggest, as the Member  for  Thomson\r\n\r\nsuggests, that one makes political appointments for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of having yes men is a proposition  so  absurd\r\n\r\nand  so  stupid that if ever he got endowed  with  these\r\n\r\npowers and uses them in the way he believes I have  used\r\n\r\nthem, then the State would collapse ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

These  things\r\n\r\ncannot  be  done in a matter of months. These are  plans\r\n\r\nformulated   in  1959  and  1960,  when  the  unpleasant\r\n\r\ndecisions had to be made to up the taxes, to put on  the\r\n\r\neconomy  measures, in order to produce results in  1961,\r\n\r\n1962  and  now 1963. If only the Member for Thomson  had\r\n\r\nmore  moral  fibre,  he  would  have  stood  up  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunists at the unpopular moments that we went through\r\n\r\nand  he  would have seen sunshine at the end of it  all.\r\n\r\nInstead of that, they switched sides and now they  found\r\n\r\nout  that it was the wrong side. I suggest to the Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson seriously to consider whether he is wise  in\r\n\r\nhis  own interest to make these suggestions. Mr Francis\r\n\r\nScow  is  one of the outstanding officers in  the  State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General's Department, and the  State  Advocate-General,  I  am  proud  to say, recommended  him  for  a\r\n\r\ncitation, together with other officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A D.P.P. prosecuting or a Solicitor-General\r\n\r\nprosecuting  before  a  district  court  is  no  unusual\r\n\r\nbusiness.

As  District\r\n\r\nJudge,  Mr  Francis  Seow sentenced  Mr  Bani's  close\r\n\r\nassociate  and  stooge, Mr Foo, in the Business  Houses\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union,  to  nine months for  putting  lighted\r\n\r\ncigarettes  on  the back of non-striking  workers  in  a\r\n\r\ncowardly and dastardly manner.

I\r\n\r\nhope  he  is the wiser for it; for if there is any  more\r\n\r\nsuch foolishness of brutality and bullying next time, he\r\n\r\nwill   find  that  the  first  offence  is  taken   into\r\n\r\nconsideration when the second conviction is considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political appointments?

It is a matter for the Court\r\n\r\nof  Appeal  to  decide. Everybody heard every  scrap  of\r\n\r\nevidence, every lie that went on in the court for a full 2\u00bd  months.

I can only tell\r\n\r\nhim  that the only mitigation I can find for him is that\r\n\r\nprobably  he  is ignorant of the system of law  that  is\r\n\r\napplied in this country, and indeed that applies in  all\r\n\r\nother  countries where members of the Bar and the  Bench\r\n\r\nare small in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a pity that the Member for Anson is not\r\n\r\nhere, because I think on an occasion like this he serves\r\n\r\na  useful purpose, because I use him as a sounding board\r\n\r\nfor  concessions  and admissions. All over  the  British\r\n\r\nCommonwealth,  this system prevails. Before  a  man  can\r\n\r\never  become a Judge of the High court, he should  have,\r\n\r\nin   his   career,  acquired  a  varied  experience   as\r\n\r\nprosecutor, as counsel for the defendant and the plaintiff,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadviser,  draftsman, magistrate,  Registrar,  and\r\n\r\nOfficial  Assignee. In other parts of  the  world,  they\r\n\r\nhave   recruited  their  puisne  judges  from  the  Bar.\r\n\r\nDifferent systems prevail. A man picks up his experience\r\n\r\nin  the  wider  world and then retires on  his  year  of\r\n\r\nlargest  income, off income tax, on the Bench.  That  is\r\n\r\nnot possible here, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Farrer Park will remember that\r\n\r\nI  went through the Bar list of 130 names with him. That\r\n\r\nis  all there is to it in Singapore. And you have to run\r\n\r\na  judiciary,  you have got to run a legal service,  you\r\n\r\nhave  to  man all your other departments connected  with\r\n\r\nthe  law, Trade Marks, Official Assignee, with the  same\r\n\r\ngroup  of men. You have got to be fair and give  them  a\r\n\r\nvaried  experience. This is purely a professional matter\r\n\r\nwhich  is  settled  between the State Advocate-General,\r\n\r\nthe Chief Justice, one Puisne Judge and the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  Public  Service Commission. It was  so  decided  in\r\n\r\nLondon in 1957. We defended the Constitution - the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson  may  remember - in  the  Tanjong  Pagar  by-election. We fought on the basis of this Constitution in\r\n\r\n1959.  Now we are on the verge of changing it. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  if  the Member for Thomson thinks it a change  for\r\n\r\nthe  better. But right at this moment, we are  seriously\r\n\r\nconsidering  the  problem of future  appointments  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Perhaps the Member for Thomson does not  know\r\n\r\nthat in the Federation the Chief Justice is appointed by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister and so are the Puisne Judges. That is\r\n\r\nan  independent  country. And here in a semi-independent\r\n\r\ncountry,  we  allow  the Judges  to  sit  together  and\r\n\r\nappoint  another  man to join their august  ranks.  What\r\n\r\nsystem  is  to endure after Malaysia? This is a  subject\r\n\r\nfor   careful  debate  between  the  Chief  Justice   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and his brother Judges and the State Advocate-General, who is at the present moment in Kuala Lumpur in\r\n\r\na  conference of lawyers, a conference which I may  have\r\n\r\nto join shortly within\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  next  day or so, if I may have the consent  of  one\r\n\r\nMember on the other side of this House. If not, then  we\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  run  the risk of having  the  Government\r\n\r\ndefeated  and  voted out of office, and the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  or perhaps the Member for Queenstown will  feel\r\n\r\nthe  noose slip from round his neck again. But there  it\r\n\r\nis.  These are the problems. And I am glad that  in  his\r\n\r\nsecond  speech  he has decided - as the  Leninist  phrase\r\n\r\ngoes -  \"one step forward, two steps back wards\"; it  is\r\n\r\nnot  two steps forward, one step backwards, but one step\r\n\r\nforward and two steps backward. That is right. There is\r\n\r\nnothing wrong with these appointments. What is wrong is,\r\n\r\nit  is  a pity that they should be shunted about in  the\r\n\r\nway  they are. If the Member for Thomson has any  really\r\n\r\nbright ideas, let him give serious thought to them,  not\r\n\r\nwith the idea of getting Judges or Magistrates who will\r\n\r\nlet  off  criminals  by  being  intimidated  from  this\r\n\r\nChamber.  I  do not think  - not the men I know - that  they\r\n\r\nwill  likely be so inclined. They are not likely  to  be\r\n\r\nrattled by the fierce noises here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what I have suggested to the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson  is, I think, the most honourable thing  he  can\r\n\r\ndo.  If  he  really  believes that these  are  political\r\n\r\nappointees who do my bidding - are puppets - then  I  say,\r\n\r\n\"Say  it  outside.\" He has retracted now, and  he  says,\r\n\r\n\"No.  It is the system.\" I say that if he can suggest  a\r\n\r\nbetter  system  of  having  these  four  men  sit   down\r\n\r\nprofessionally  and  decide  how  to  give  everybody  a\r\n\r\nchance,  because  this is a competitive  race  within  a\r\n\r\nservice to the top, and the top is the High Court Bench,\r\n\r\nlet him put up his proposals. The constitutional lawyers\r\n\r\nare  at the present moment in Kuala Lumpur. Lawyers from\r\n\r\nBrunei,  North  Borneo, Sarawak, London,  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur arc all there drafting. On this matter, may\r\n\r\nI  take  this  opportunity to say that when  the  House\r\n\r\nrises en Saturday, the Leader of the House will formally\r\n\r\nmove that we adjourn to the beginning of August  - I think\r\n\r\nit  is  the 7th of August. But I am hoping, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, and I would like to give due notice now that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  constitutional provisions will be finished before\r\n\r\nthen.  There is no hope now, in view of the delay  that\r\n\r\nhas  taken place partly because of us and partly because\r\n\r\nof  Brunei -  difficulties over oil in one case and common\r\n\r\nmarket  and surplus in the other - that the constitutional\r\n\r\nprovisions will be ready before 27th June, when  we  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to initial the broad principles. But  I  hope,\r\n\r\nbefore  7th August, to be able to reconvene this  House,\r\n\r\nif  it  is  possible. And I hope, Mr Speaker, Sir,  you\r\n\r\nwill  give  due  weight  to the request  then,  because\r\n\r\notherwise we will run into the 31st of August whilst  we\r\n\r\nare still debating these provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

But before I do that, I must accept  what\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister says. I am not a legal student, Sir.\r\n\r\nI  must  say  that I have not been as fortunate  as  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister who has gone to Cambridge and acquired  a\r\n\r\nlegal degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that I want to ask him is this. He says\r\n\r\nthat  it  is necessary to have a variety of  duties  so\r\n\r\nthat  varied experience is gathered for officers in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment legal service. What I would like to  ask  him\r\n\r\nis  whether it is necessary for an officer in the  legal\r\n\r\nservice,  after  having been a D.P.P.,  to  have  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed  a District Judge and then go back  to  be  a\r\n\r\nD.P.P. to   acquire  experience  in  the  process   of\r\n\r\nprosecution, etc.?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I would like to mention to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson how the system operates when  there\r\n\r\nare  more  bodies  that one can move about.  In  England\r\n\r\nevery  Q.C. who is a private practitioner, every leading\r\n\r\nsilk,  is at the same time a Judge and a Recorder, which\r\n\r\nmeans   the  status  of  a  District  Judge  and   First\r\n\r\nMagistrate  in  some town. He does it  as  a  matter  of\r\n\r\npublic duty. One day he is Judge and the next day he  is\r\n\r\nProsecuting Counsel, and the third day he is Counsel for\r\n\r\nthe Defendant. These are normal procedures. Because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  man  knows  what  counsel  does  when  he   is\r\n\r\nprosecuting, what counsel does when he is defending,  he\r\n\r\nis  all a better Judge when he sits on the Bench.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure  of  that. I have never  sat  on  the  Bench\r\n\r\nmyself,  Mr Speaker, Sir, but I have not the  slightest\r\n\r\ndoubt  that quite a number of the people who are at  the\r\n\r\nBar  would make very good Magistrates. It might interest\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Thomson to know that the Chief  Justice\r\n\r\nand  his  brother Judges are considering, together  with\r\n\r\nthe  Bar, a system whereby one District Court is  manned\r\n\r\nby  a  senior member of the Bar in roster, in  order  to\r\n\r\nhelp  out  in the duties so that from Time to Time  when\r\n\r\nthere are difficult cases, here is a completely unbiased\r\n\r\nmember of the Bar who could sit as District Judge.  That\r\n\r\nrequires  the co-operation of the Bar which  means  that\r\n\r\nleading  lawyers  whose  average  income  is  $4,000   a\r\n\r\nmonth - any  member of the Bar with more  than  12  years'\r\n\r\nstanding  would  deem himself a failure  if  he  is  not\r\n\r\nearning at least $4,000 a month - would have to give  that\r\n\r\nup  while sitting on the Bench. The High Court Bench  is\r\n\r\npaid  only $1,950 a month. This is another problem  that\r\n\r\nwe face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would also like to take this opportunity to say\r\n\r\nthat  far from wanting to demean them, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI have a little constitutional problem in that I have to\r\n\r\nraise their status by way of a Supplementary Estimate in\r\n\r\nthe  very  near future. It has been agreed in  principle\r\n\r\nthat the Judiciary will be Pan-Malaysian. Therefore,  as\r\n\r\nsuch,  the  basic  salaries of Puisne Judges - at  present\r\n\r\n$1,950 - will  go up to $2,100, and certain  Establishment\r\n\r\nmatters  will  have  to be cleared regarding  the  other\r\n\r\nperipheral  allowances. And before 31st  August,  I  may\r\n\r\nhave  to move the Supplementary Estimate to bring  their\r\n\r\nbasic salaries into line with the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I said to the Member for Thomson, he ought to\r\n\r\nbe careful before he ventures into this field. These are\r\n\r\nmen of some scholarship, learning and integrity. And  he\r\n\r\nis  unlikely  to  rattle them into doing things  against\r\n\r\ntheir better judgment just by casting wide aspersions ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, surely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I am not retracting from whatever I have\r\n\r\nsaid.

Merely to say that because\r\n\r\none has been a D.P.P. and that therefore when he gets on\r\n\r\nto the Bench he is going to side with the prosecution is\r\n\r\nnot correct and is not fair to the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I wish to raise: it is a\r\n\r\ntechnical  point, Mr Speaker, Sir. We are on  the  Head\r\n\r\nJudicial. A number of these appointments like the  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice  and  the Puisne Judges, all their salaries  are\r\n\r\nitems  of  statutory expenditure. There is no indication\r\n\r\nin  this Head that any of the items of expenditure under\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Justice or the Puisne Judges  are  items  of\r\n\r\nstatutory  expenditure. Now, in a minute  or  in  a  few\r\n\r\nminutes,  Mr Speaker, Sir, you are going  to  ask  this\r\n\r\nHouse  under Head 2, for the amount of $2.05 million  to\r\n\r\nbe  voted.  This Assembly cannot vote that  full  amount\r\n\r\nbecause statutory expenditure is not voted upon. Because\r\n\r\nyou will notice in Head 1 that statutory expenditure was\r\n\r\nnot  voted  by  the  Assembly;  and  the  only  item  of\r\n\r\nstatutory expenditure which should have been included in\r\n\r\npage  35  and which should have come under Judicial  has\r\n\r\nbeen  omitted.

You will\r\n\r\nremember that the Prime Minister in this very House gave\r\n\r\nas  a reason for guillotining our debate on the 9th  and\r\n\r\n10th  of  April  that he had to go to Kuala  Lumpur  for\r\n\r\nnegotiations, when in fact he went there to  play  golf;\r\n\r\nand  in  explanation in page 86 of the Hansard  of  10th\r\n\r\nJune, [Unrevised transcript] [col. 737 of Hansard,  Vol.\r\n\r\n20,  No.  6],  the  Prime Minister said  in  the  second\r\n\r\nparagraph near the end:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Therefore, for reasons which I thought to be in the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people, I did not attend a  particular\r\n\r\nmeeting  in  Kuala Lumpur and chose to stay  in  Cameron\r\n\r\nHighlands with the Prime Minister of the Federation  who\r\n\r\nwas golfing with me.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little bit of a statement shows one or two\r\n\r\npoints:  that  the  Prime Minister did  not  attend  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  because he chose to stay in Cameron  Highlands,\r\n\r\nand  therefore it could be interpreted, because of  what\r\n\r\nhad   happened  between  the  Prime  Minister  and   the\r\n\r\nFederation Ministers, that the Prime Minister was trying\r\n\r\nto  inflate his own bosom and flex his own muscles in  a\r\n\r\nshow of toughness. He never really had the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  at  heart. Because if  he  really  had  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people at heart, he would have gone  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate under any circumstances as befitting a Head of\r\n\r\nGovernment  responsible  to  the  people.  He  did  not,\r\n\r\nbecause  he wanted to inflate his own bosom,  hoping  to\r\n\r\ngive  the  impression that he was a tough guy.  That  is\r\n\r\npoint No. 1, and it shows that our Prime Minister is too\r\n\r\narrogant  even to negotiate on behalf of the  people  in\r\n\r\nspite of his own protestations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Sir, may I refer you to page 95 of the same\r\n\r\nHansard  [col.  750], when the Member for Cairnhill,  in\r\n\r\nreply,  revealed the true story. Somewhere in the middle\r\n\r\nof the second paragraph, the Member for Cairnhill said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He did not attend the meeting in Kuala Lumpur when the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister did, because he agreed with the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  the Federation of Malaya  that  no  useful\r\n\r\npurpose could be served for a meeting to be held.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, unless the Prime Minister tells us\r\n\r\nthat  this is an incorrect statement and that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill has been speaking an untruth,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister himself has been speaking an untruth.

They  have\r\n\r\nroll-calls,  and  if they do not answer the  roll-calls,\r\n\r\nthey lose their money. Is that what the Work Brigade  is\r\n\r\nmeant  for? The Prime Minister, of course, says that  he\r\n\r\ngoes to the rural constituencies to meet the people. But\r\n\r\nwhom  can he deceive? He cannot deceive the people. When\r\n\r\npeople go to meet the Prime Minister, he disappears.  He\r\n\r\nscoots from his office. Families wanted to meet him, but\r\n\r\nhe  dared not meet them. So how can he say that he  goes\r\n\r\nto  meet the people? When he goes to a constituency,  he\r\n\r\nmakes  sure that all his bodyguards are around him,  and\r\n\r\nif  anybody should want to hand a memorandum to him,  he\r\n\r\nhas  first  to go through a certain sieve, so to  speak,\r\n\r\nbefore  he  has even a chance of just handing  over  the\r\n\r\nmemorandum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was so embarrassed that he made sure that such people who wanted to meet him were completely prevented from\r\n\r\ndoing so. These are only a few facts about his constituency visits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Prime Minister is also in charge of the ex-City Council and the Public Utilities Board is also\r\n\r\nunder   him.  Everybody  is  suffering  from  the  water\r\n\r\nshortage.  If you go home at any time in the  middle  of\r\n\r\nthe  day, you just do not have water for a wash.  But  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that Oxley Road has no water rationing. I  do\r\n\r\nnot know who stays in Oxley Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Why should he  have\r\n\r\nwater all the day when other people who need it most  do\r\n\r\nnot get it? Let him answer all this.

If  he was confused over the two,  then,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  he  should have paid two visits,  one  in  his\r\n\r\ncapacity as the Prime Minister and later on unofficially\r\n\r\nas  the  Secretary-General of the People's Action Party.\r\n\r\nIt  is  because he went in his dual capacity that people\r\n\r\nwere  confused. When he attacked other political Parties\r\n\r\nin  the  course of his visit, I think that was improper,\r\n\r\nbecause  if he, as the Prime Minister, made a  political\r\n\r\nspeech  before a crowd that was there to meet  him,  he\r\n\r\nopened  himself  to  the criticism that  he  is  like  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  servant  making  use  of  his  position  for\r\n\r\npersonal  profit.  Sir, I am sure he does  not  want  to\r\n\r\nexpose  himself  to that criticism. In future,  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest that he make two separate visits instead of one,\r\n\r\nas  the Prime  Minister and as the Secretary-General  of\r\n\r\nthe People's Action Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I expect we will have to dwell at\r\n\r\ngreat  length on this Head.

It leads to  neurosis.  My\r\n\r\nheart  goes  out  to the Member for Queenstown.  On  two\r\n\r\noccasions,   he   found   the  burden   of   his   heavy\r\n\r\nresponsibility too much for him, and he literally passed\r\n\r\nout.

Sir,I\r\n\r\nsincerely hope that the Press will note this, because if\r\n\r\nindeed  Oxley Road is getting water and other roads  are\r\n\r\nnot, then this is a valuable piece of information to all\r\n\r\nin the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneighbourhood. I am sorry to say that all the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  has done now is to enrage all my  neighbours\r\n\r\nwho  will run around wondering how I can get water  into\r\n\r\nmy  house when they cannot get it into theirs next  door\r\n\r\nand  in  front  and behind and when there  has  been  no\r\n\r\nspecial  road-digging to connect a special  pipe  to  my\r\n\r\nhouse.  Apart  from  the fact that  he  will  enrage  my\r\n\r\nneighbours,  I  am quite happy that he should  have  got\r\n\r\nthis off his chest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I have been likened to Baron Profumo, a man\r\n\r\nof  great prowess in many fields of war and love. It  is\r\n\r\nbeing  suggested  that, like him, I have  lied  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  Now,  Sir,  I have many shortcomings,  like  any\r\n\r\nother  human  being.  But I hope that  I  am  reasonably\r\n\r\ncircumspect  never to be a blatant liar. I said  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse  on  the  night of 9th April that  we  had  urgent\r\n\r\ntalks,  and we had talks, because Tun Razak was  leaving\r\n\r\nafter Easter for Washington and London and he would  not\r\n\r\nbe  hack for a month. Talks were held - I have the records\r\n\r\nhere -  and meetings were held. I was there the very  same\r\n\r\nnight  while  the Member for Queenstown was  talking  at\r\n\r\ngreat  length in this Chamber. I was told I missed  very\r\n\r\nlittle.   However,  if  there  is  anything   of   great\r\n\r\nimportance which he thinks I ought to know,  I  hope  he\r\n\r\nwill  refer  me to the relevant sections of Hansard.  We\r\n\r\nwere  in Kuala Lumpur meeting on 10th and 11th, and  the\r\n\r\n12th  was Goad Friday. We returned to Singapore. We were\r\n\r\ndue to go back for another meeting on the 16th, Tuesday.\r\n\r\nIn  the  meantime,  in  the Finance  Ministry  of  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur, the thermometer went up. I was going up to  join\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku for Easter at Cameron Highlands to play golf,\r\n\r\namongst other things, in a special plane - there was  a\r\n\r\nspecial  reason why there was a special plane; a special\r\n\r\nR.M.A.F. plane picked me up at Kuala Lumpur, landed  me\r\n\r\nat Bidor, flew on and picked the Tunku up at Butterworth\r\n\r\nand  brought him back to Bidor, and we sojourned in  the\r\n\r\nHighlands for four days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan originally was that I was to be down on\r\n\r\nTuesday  for  further  talks  - I read  that  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Federation said this in the Sunday  Times  of  14th\r\n\r\nApril at page 1 referring to what Tunku Abdul Rahman had\r\n\r\ntold Mr Lee:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`He added, \"What the Federation Prime Minister told Mr\r\n\r\nLee  was that the Federation was the goose that lays the\r\n\r\ngolden eggs. But it was Singapore who has benefited from\r\n\r\nthose  eggs. In other words, Singapore derives the  main\r\n\r\nbenefit as middleman from the goods, the toil and  sweat\r\n\r\nof  the Federation. It was therefore only right that the\r\n\r\nFederal Government should be entitled to a fair share of\r\n\r\nSingapore's   prosperity,  for   without   the   natural\r\n\r\nresources of the Federation, where would Singapore be?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan said it was clear that on Thursday [that was the week before, on the 10th of April when the meetings were held] the talks were\r\n\r\non the verge of breaking down. Then  he said, \"It was in fact at his \r\n\r\n(Mr Lee's) urging that  the  Federation Government agreed to continue \r\n\r\nthe talks next week.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I read this with some interest. I did ask for  the\r\n\r\ntalks.  I  seriously  urged that we  should  meet  again\r\n\r\nbefore Tun Razak went off because Time was running  out;\r\n\r\nand  when  I  read that in the open Press, I felt  that,\r\n\r\nrightly  or  wrongly,  the  Finance  Minister   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation had misunderstood my position. He  thought  I\r\n\r\nwas  on  the verge of a nervous breakdown because  there\r\n\r\nwas  no  agreement and that I went down on my knees  and\r\n\r\npleaded  for another. If I turned up at the  meeting  on\r\n\r\nTuesday  with the Finance Minister of the Federation  in\r\n\r\nthat  frame of mind, and he suddenly found that far from\r\n\r\ngoing  down  on my knees I started telling  him  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat I thought of it all, he would probably fly off into\r\n\r\na  rage,  which would not help things at all. Therefore,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  rarefied  and comforting  atmosphere  of  the\r\n\r\nHighlands, I let it be known, with the agreement of  the\r\n\r\nTunku who had spoken to his Deputy, that I was not going\r\n\r\ndown  to  Kuala  Lumpur until the temperature  had  gone\r\n\r\ndown. This was reported in the Straits Times of 17th.  I\r\n\r\nthink I am entitled to choose my own tactics. This is  a\r\n\r\ngruelling  process in which I am engaged with a  company\r\n\r\ndirector  of  no  mean  skill as a company  director - and\r\n\r\ncompany  directors are hard-headed men who have a  glint\r\n\r\nin  their  eyes when they see money, and when  they  see\r\n\r\nSingapore's  surpluses there is more  than  a  glint  in\r\n\r\ntheir eyes. And whilst I like to keep everybody\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhappy, I must do it on conditions which make sure that I\r\n\r\nkeep  Singapore  and  the people of Singapore  generally\r\n\r\nhappy,  including the Member for Queenstown,  because  I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  him that if there were not all  this  money\r\n\r\naround  the place, you can send any number of  thugs  to\r\n\r\nbeat the man up and he would not have the $5 to give you\r\n\r\nfor  your  arch.  It is not possible. He  must  have  $5\r\n\r\nfirst.  I make no apologies for choosing my own tactics.\r\n\r\nI   have  said  before  that  we  are  always  ready  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate. We still are. But I have made it quite  clear\r\n\r\nthat the formula - and I am now fortified by the unanimous\r\n\r\nsupport   of  the  House  because  there  was  not   one\r\n\r\ndissenting voice that night.

The Finance Minister of the\r\n\r\nFederation disclosed it and said I begged for a  further\r\n\r\nmeeting.  I decided that in those circumstances  it  was\r\n\r\nhardly  likely that there was going to be  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nargument, and he was probably under the impression  that\r\n\r\nI  was going to fall down on my bended knees and entreat\r\n\r\nhim for a settlement. So I thought the best thing to  do\r\n\r\nwas   to  allow  things  to  cool  down.

The Member  for  Queenstown\r\n\r\ntried  to pinpoint the statements made in this House  on\r\n\r\nthe  10th, and he said that one of us (either the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  or  I)  was  telling  an  untruth.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  therefore  had to stand  up  and  explain  the\r\n\r\nsituation,  to  try to say that what he said  about  the\r\n\r\n10th  was  the  truth. I would not have wanted  to  pick\r\n\r\nflaws  in his statement if he had just left it at  that.\r\n\r\nHe  said, about the 9th, that he left for Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\non  the 9th. That was true in that while the debate  was\r\n\r\ngoing  on,  he was in Kuala Lumpur on the 10th.  On  the\r\n\r\n10th, in the morning, he was having a wonderful game  of\r\n\r\ngolf, and in the afternoon when the meeting was to have\r\n\r\nbeen held, he did not attend that meeting.

I  myself  am\r\n\r\nquite interested in this matter, and so I would like  to\r\n\r\ngive  my  own  views on it. I personally feel  that  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of the State is not only a  clever  man,\r\n\r\neloquent  and  capable, but today  he  is  also  a  very\r\n\r\noutstanding actor in this House. As a matter of fact, we\r\n\r\ncan  see for ourselves that when the Prime Minister goes\r\n\r\non rural visits, his performance is very outstanding and\r\n\r\nwonderful.  Sometimes he cries, sometimes he jumps,  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  he laughs, and there is a lot of  banging  of\r\n\r\ngongs and drums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a very interesting matter for the Prime Minister to go to the rural areas. We originally did not bother about these things. But because the Prime Minister has said in this House that we cannot stop his visits to the rural areas. I would like to reply that we do not have any intention of\r\n\r\nstopping  him from going there. We can see  clearly,  as\r\n\r\nour  Party Chairman and other Members of this House have\r\n\r\npointed  out, that the Prime Minister has been going  on\r\n\r\nrural  visits  to waste public funds. We know  that  the\r\n\r\nmarket is not so good these few days, and the visits  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister have -not been of any benefit to the\r\n\r\npea-pie.  Instead  it has cost them some  money  in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding and construction of arches. So we say that this\r\n\r\nis  a  suicidal  move  of  the  Prime  Minister  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical  field. We do not care to stop him. [Laughter]\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  a  joke.  I  think you  are  crying  inside\r\n\r\nyourself. This is not a joke, you know. [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nrural visits of the Prime Minister, as he explains,  are\r\n\r\nmade  to enable him to understand the livelihood of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the rural areas. But what is the method  and\r\n\r\nhow does he go about this thing? He goes about it in the\r\n\r\ngrandest way. How can he say that he can understand  the\r\n\r\nway  of living of the people? From the history of  China\r\n\r\nwe  can see that those officials who were interested  in\r\n\r\nthe  livelihood of the people, when they went on  visits\r\n\r\nto  the  people,  went in a very plain  manner,  without\r\n\r\nbeing  noticed by members of the public.  They  did  not\r\n\r\nmake  a  lot  of fuss and visit places where there  were\r\n\r\nlots of arches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, actually the aim of the Prime Minister in his rural visits is only to make political propaganda. We can see that when the Prime Minister said things during his visits, they were said with threats or deceit, especially recently with regard to the breakdown in the financial talks. The Prime Minister made use of\r\n\r\nthe   opportunity  during  his  rural  visits  to   make\r\n\r\ncomplaints before the people. When he met with difficulties,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  said  that  they  were  difficulties  in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  talks;  and then all of a sudden  he  made  a\r\n\r\ntwist and said that there was much progress. So he tried\r\n\r\nto  make use of his rural visits to show that he is  one\r\n\r\nwho is a hero looking after the interests of the people.\r\n\r\nBut  how  has he helped in the livelihood of the people?\r\n\r\nIf  one says that the amenities of any constituency must\r\n\r\ndepend on the rural visits of the Prime Minister, then I\r\n\r\nsay that this Government is incapable and incompetent. I\r\n\r\nwould  say that a responsible Prime Minister should  not\r\n\r\ndo  a  thing of this nature. If you want to develop  the\r\n\r\nrural areas or to construct any road, then you must  not\r\n\r\nwait until the Prime Minister goes on a rural visit.

That is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was quite irresponsible when he said that he\r\n\r\nagreed  to the detention of these people during February\r\n\r\nof  this year, because he wanted them to have some  rest\r\n\r\nand free meals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I say that this kind of talk should not have come from a responsible Prime Minister. I would like to explain to you further about this matter. I am a citizen of Singapore. Is that not right? If the Government is so irresponsible as to detain anybody and make use of public funds to feed them when they can work for their own livelihood, then the Government is being\r\n\r\nirresponsible. If these persons have not  committed  any\r\n\r\ncrime, the Government cannot do this.

I  say  that  responsible\r\n\r\ncitizens were very unhappy about his statement.

I would suggest that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Stamford make a few notes. It would be much simpler\r\n\r\nfor interpretation. The Prime Minister completes what he\r\n\r\nhas  to  say,  and  then  I will allow  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nStamford to reply. Mr Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister (In Mandarin): The Rural Dwellers\r\n\r\nand   Country  Peoples  Association  wanted  to  protest\r\n\r\nagainst  the  anti-colonialist heroes. I am  an  elected\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. Therefore, I cannot help  but  persuade\r\n\r\nthem to meet me in an open front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same womenfolk in Jalan Kayu and the women in\r\n\r\nThomson  District  said  that I did  not  satisfy  their\r\n\r\nneeds.  What  are their needs? Do they want  payment  or\r\n\r\nmaterial  compensation?  Why  all  these  arrogant   and\r\n\r\nunjustifiable claims? All these are false statements. If\r\n\r\nthe  question of compensation is settled, they will then\r\n\r\nbring  up another question. All compensations have  been\r\n\r\npaid. So if both say that they are right, then one  must\r\n\r\nbe lying. So I asked one old woman to come and see me on\r\n\r\nSunday  and  then  on Monday when Press  reporters  were\r\n\r\npresent,  she  dared not turn up, because  her  master's\r\n\r\nsupporters did not dare come out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young Lady Member has described my rural visits as\r\n\r\na  show of putting across my emotions and feelings. If I\r\n\r\nhave  made any errors, I will ask her to excuse me.  She\r\n\r\nhas  paid so much attention to my rural visits.  I  feel\r\n\r\nvery  touched and happy. To have such attention paid  by\r\n\r\nher shows that there is a real need for my rural visits.\r\n\r\nThen,  in future, we shall be able to disclose  step  by\r\n\r\nstep  whatever false statements they have  made  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  since 1959. I personally hope that  one  day  so\r\n\r\nyoung   a  lady  like  her  will  get  more  and  richer\r\n\r\nexperience  and then perhaps she may help us  to  manage\r\n\r\nour  affairs.  As to telling me how to be a  good  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, it is very kind of her, but if she says that I\r\n\r\nhave  been irresponsible in my talks to the people, then\r\n\r\nI say it is not a fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that those detained are having a rest and\r\n\r\nfree meals.

Therefore, I  hope  these\r\n\r\npeople  can  review what they have done in the  past  in\r\n\r\nthese   quiet  surroundings.

In the  past,\r\n\r\nbecause  the educational policies in schools were  in  a\r\n\r\nchaotic state, the future of the students was in a  very\r\n\r\nbad state: so they stood up to protest against this. The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister then said that these people are young and\r\n\r\ninexperienced and can easily be made use of. I must  ask\r\n\r\nhim what about these aged womenfolk? Will they be easily\r\n\r\nmade  use of too? By this argument, he will feel ashamed\r\n\r\nof  himself. Old women have their own ideas. With  years\r\n\r\nof  life  and  experience behind them, how can  they  be\r\n\r\neasily made use of?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has said just now that he wishes that I must have full and rich experience before I can help him.

He does not know his own standing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister always says that those under detention are living very well, but I must point out that if a person loses his liberty and has only good meals, then he is no better off than a pig.

For item (4)  in 1962, we had a  token  vote\r\n\r\nof  $10, and we are still asked to give a token vote  of\r\n\r\n$10  for  1963. But in the meantime a post of  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary (Special Duties), Grade C, has been created in\r\n\r\n1962. I thought that when that post was created it would\r\n\r\nhave  filled that vote for the Permanent Secretary  with\r\n\r\nthe  token  vote of $10. Can the Prime Minister  explain\r\n\r\nwhy  he  should  want two Permanent Secretaries  in  one\r\n\r\nsmall Ministry, which will get smaller and smaller after\r\n\r\nMalaysia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir. One\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretary is at the moment acting as  General\r\n\r\nManager  of the Public Utilities Board: hence the  token\r\n\r\nvote  of  $10. The position is quite simple.  I  get  no\r\n\r\nbenefit  out of having two Permanent Secretaries because\r\n\r\nthey  are  doing  their respective duties  whether  they\r\n\r\nappear on my list or somebody else's list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my Ministry shrinking after Malaysia, I think\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill must have got his White  Paper\r\n\r\nwrong,  as  mainly  it  is  the  Home  Affairs  that  is\r\n\r\nshrinking.

But what we do not want to see is  the  use  of\r\n\r\npublic funds to buy silver medals, gold medals and  what\r\n\r\nhave they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  give  people whose services are recognized  only  if\r\n\r\nthose   services  are  to  the  advantage  of   P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\npolitical interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true that if we go through the names - and\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister himself has accepted it to  be  true\r\n\r\njust  now  in the reply given to the Member for  Queenstown - in  the  list there are many whose only meritorious\r\n\r\nservice appears to be activities which are political and\r\n\r\nin  the interest of the P.A.P. There are a lot of people\r\n\r\nlike   Devan   Nair - for  example.  Mr   Gopalakrishnan.\r\n\r\nPractically all the P.A.P. trade union leaders have been\r\n\r\ngiven  citations - gold  medals, I  suppose.  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nstrange again that some equally well-known P.A.P. trade\r\n\r\nunionists  have been omitted. I am quite sure that  this\r\n\r\nis  not  a  mistake,  but quite a  deliberate  act.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  former  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture whose standing, I believe,  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s small trade union world, is equivalent to  that\r\n\r\nof  Mr  Devan Nair, or if not Devan Nair, at  least,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  Sir, to that of other people like Ho See  Beng\r\n\r\nand  so on. But the Parliamentary Secretary did not  get\r\n\r\none.  There is one other interesting example, Mr T.  V.\r\n\r\nGomez, who is also a notorious P.A.P. trade unionist. He\r\n\r\nhas  also  been left out. Perhaps the reasons  are  that\r\n\r\ngiving  citations to these people would only make things\r\n\r\nmore obvious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not think it is proper for the Government to\r\n\r\nutilise public funds in the region of $20,000 - next  year\r\n\r\n$23,940  merely to give citations to individuals because\r\n\r\ntheir activities favour the P.A.P.'s interest. This,  we\r\n\r\nthink, is a complete waste of Time and a waste of money,\r\n\r\nparticularly in a period which is described by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister as a period of austerity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is another\r\n\r\ninstance  where  the Government has  been  using  public\r\n\r\nfunds  for  its own party purposes.

But  in  order  for  a\r\n\r\ndecoration  or medal to be accepted by the  people,  the\r\n\r\nperson  who  receives  it  must  have  contributed  some\r\n\r\nsubstantial  service to the State, otherwise  the  medal\r\n\r\nwould be no more valuable ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> --- than the metal it is made of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in its last days of power, we see the Government coming out with emergency laws and by-laws, and putting forward new prizes for those who have helped the P.A.P.

I have no doubt that some  of  these\r\n\r\nmedals   were   given  to  those  who  have  contributed\r\n\r\nmeritorious service not to the State as such but to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. There is one single instance where I wish to seek\r\n\r\nclarification  from the Government.  I  remember  a  few\r\n\r\nweeks  before  these medals were given,  the  Organising\r\n\r\nSecretary  of the P.A.P., who is the Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,   opened  a  P.A.P.  Branch   in   Jalan   Kayu\r\n\r\nconstituency, and in his speech he paid tribute and  was\r\n\r\ngrateful to one of the contractors - a famous contractor - building  lots  of houses in Sembawang and  Jalan  Kayu\r\n\r\narea by the name of Mr Ang Oon Hwee, who had given  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. the branch premises in Jalan Kayu. Not many weeks\r\n\r\nlater after that, Mr Ang Oon Hwee got a medal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I think the Member for Hong Lim  has  got\r\n\r\nhis facts wrong.

Amongst\r\n\r\nthose  who  got  the meritorious service medal  are  two\r\n\r\nmembers  of the Special Branch, Mr Ahmad Khan  and  Mr\r\n\r\nRichard  Byrne Corridon. They did their work  well,  not\r\n\r\nfor the P.A.P., Mr Speaker. Sir. They were there before\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., they will be there after the 31st of August\r\n\r\nwhen they will not be working for the P.A.P. at all, and\r\n\r\nthey  will  be working direct to Kuala Lumpur.

So tot) Mr Koh Teck Kin, the\r\n\r\nPresident  of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce,  and  Mr\r\n\r\nAssomull. They are not P.A.P. members. Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nThey  rendered valuable services as the leaders  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunities  at  a Time when men who were  faint-hearted\r\n\r\nducked  for  cover before it was known that  the  battle\r\n\r\nwould  be  fought and won.

No Member of the Government,  whether  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary,  a  Minister  or  a  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary, got any decorations, because as a  matter  of\r\n\r\nprinciple we felt that they are not eligible. Therefore,\r\n\r\nMr  Kandasamy, Mr Jek Yuen Thong, Mr Rahim Ishak  did\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nqualify. Whether they were or they were not, the  matter\r\n\r\ndoes  not  arise.

And I say the State of Singapore\r\n\r\nowes  him  that  star. And let me tell  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  this, that Mr Devan Nair has got more iron  in\r\n\r\nhis  soul than the Member for Thomson. Twice he went  to\r\n\r\nprison  for  long periods, and he has got  the  guts  to\r\n\r\nstand up to fight for his beliefs. I hope the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson  will emerge as much a man of iron as Mr  Devan\r\n\r\nNair. Then he is in a position to deride Mr Devan  Nair\r\n\r\nand  the medal which I think the State owed him, not for\r\n\r\nwhat  he did for the P.A.P. but for what he did for  the\r\n\r\ncountry  in exposing the Communist conspiracy  here,  in\r\n\r\nCairo,  Moshi and a lot of other places besides, and  he\r\n\r\nwill continue to do so to the great discomfiture of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists, all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister.

It  is  true that I have read The Three  Kingdoms\r\n\r\nvery thoroughly, and because of that reason we have been\r\n\r\nable to escape so far unscathed from the repression, the\r\n\r\noppressive methods, the cunningness and the ruthlessness\r\n\r\nof  the  Prime  Minister, because he typifies  the  same\r\n\r\nperson   in   The  Three  Kingdoms,  Chou  Chou,   whose\r\n\r\ncharacteristics  are  cunningness,  ruthlessness,  small\r\n\r\neyes and cruelty in the extreme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, as the political life of the Government is\r\n\r\ncoming to an end, it is apparently doing something which\r\n\r\nis  very good at first sight. In 1962, on National  Day,\r\n\r\nthe  Government gave away quite a great number of  State\r\n\r\nhonours  and decorations but at that Time the number  of\r\n\r\nrecipients did not exceed 30. But this year,  all  of  a\r\n\r\nsudden and out of the blue, the number increased to 424.\r\n\r\nDoes it mean that these people who have been given these\r\n\r\nhonours  did not give any service to the State in  1962?\r\n\r\nDoes it mean, in the opinion of the Prime Minister, that\r\n\r\nthese  people have done a great deal for the  Government\r\n\r\nin 1963 and nothing in 1962? No, that is not the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the intention of the Government is to make use of these honours and decorations to achieve its political aim. Of course, we do not have any objection to those who have really rendered services to the State receiving State honours and decorations. But in the list of recipients made public by the Government, there is a great number of people who actually work for the\r\n\r\nGovernment itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the Prime Minister visited the Sembawang constituency, there was a welcoming committee organised for this purpose and among the recipients of the State honours are members of this welcoming committee. One of them was the Chairman, Mr Yeo Kok Wah, and the other was a working committee member. For example, in Tam-pines, a recipient of the State honours\r\n\r\nwas  a member of the welcoming committee on the occasion\r\n\r\nof a rural visit by the Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, why\r\n\r\nis it that the Prime Minister wants to do this? Well, it\r\n\r\nis  all  because  he knows that in the near  future  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will  have to face the judgment of  the  people.\r\n\r\nThat  is why it has to do these things to buy over  some\r\n\r\npeople in order to save its political life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister mentioned Mr Ko Teck Kin and says that he is not a member of the P.A.P. True, but we must not forget that the Vice President, Mr Yap Pheng Gek, was not given any honour or decoration. Why? Well, it\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  because he has crossed over to the M.C.A., and  that\r\n\r\nis why the Government did not give him one. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nI can assure this House that if Mr Ko Teck Kin had been\r\n\r\na  member  of the M.C.A., he, would not have been  given\r\n\r\nany State honour or decoration. So all this goes to show\r\n\r\nthat  the intention of the Government in giving  honours\r\n\r\nand  decorations  to  certain  people  is  for  its  own\r\n\r\npolitical  end.  Mr  Speaker,  if  my  information   is\r\n\r\ncorrect,  in  1962, the recipients of State honours  and\r\n\r\ndecorations   included  the  Vice  Chancellor   of   the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore, Dr Sreenivasan. But he did not\r\n\r\naccept  this honour. So we can see that it is  not  good\r\n\r\nfor  people  to  receive honours given  by  the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nbecause  they know that by receiving them they  will  be\r\n\r\nbought over by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, it grieves me to have to\r\n\r\nberate Members on the opposite side.

And I make  no\r\n\r\napologies  that Mr Devan Nair deserves  honour,  and  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  if  there should be a subsequent  Government\r\n\r\nwhich is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  he  will continue his good work, carry  on  the\r\n\r\nbattle  against the Communists and receive high honours.\r\n\r\nWhy  the  number? It took us four years to see  who  was\r\n\r\nwho. The Chief Architect of the Housing Board got a gold\r\n\r\nmedal for public administration. I think he deserves it.\r\n\r\nSo  does  the Acting Director of Primary Production  who\r\n\r\nhas  done  a  splendid job in the rural  areas - pig  stud\r\n\r\nservice,  chicken inoculation, ploughing  service,  tree\r\n\r\ninfection  service, educating, advising and helping.  He\r\n\r\nwas  there  before the P.A.P. He will be  there  if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is not in Government next year. [Interruption] He\r\n\r\nwas  there before the P.A.P. He will be there after  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is gone. He deserves a gold medal.

It  is  foolish. About the Public Service  Star,\r\n\r\nyes, there can be an argument. Yes, Mr Ko Teck Kin  got\r\n\r\na  Meritorious  Service Medal for  taking  a  stand  for\r\n\r\nmerger and Malaysia before the battle was fought and won\r\n\r\nwhen it looked as if it could have been fought and lost.\r\n\r\nAnd he would still have the Star if he joined the M.C.A.\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong of the Hakka Association got a Public Service Star, and he is a member of the M.C.A.

Mr Yeow  Kok  Hua, one  of  the\r\n\r\nrecipients,  was the chairman of a welcoming  committee.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, this Mr Yeow Kok Hua was unknown  to\r\n\r\nall  the  people  in Sembawang before. Even  during  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  they  did  not  come  out  to  support   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  merger proposals. Where is  their  courage\r\n\r\nand bravery? Where is their achievement? His only merit\r\n\r\nis that he was the chairman of a welcoming committee for\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister. When the Prime Minister went there,\r\n\r\nhe shook hands with him. In return for this service, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  gave him a medal.  The  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nmentioned why the people in Choa Chu Kang were not given\r\n\r\nany medals. The answer is that there will not be any by-election in Choa Chu Kang. The Prime Minister knows that\r\n\r\nin  the very near future there will be a by-election  in\r\n\r\nSembawang,   and,  therefore,  this  is  a   very   good\r\n\r\nopportunity to buy over these people. Therefore, in  the\r\n\r\ncitations,  at  least  two members from  Sembawang  were\r\n\r\nawarded  medals. Their only merit was that they went  to\r\n\r\nwelcome the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the facts are very clear.

They have every reason  to  be\r\n\r\nopposed to the conferring of medals and awards on people\r\n\r\nwho  have shown that they are not Communists, that  they\r\n\r\nare not prepared\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto be intimidated by the Communists or by their threats.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  am  told  is that in some Communist  countries,\r\n\r\nreceiving honours is a dangerous thing, because  certain\r\n\r\nwriters and patriots get medals one day and the next day\r\n\r\nthey  vanish  from the scene. They are repudiated,  they\r\n\r\nare  condemned. In fact, Sir, I am told  that  even  the\r\n\r\nleader,  the  boss of the Communist Party who  conferred\r\n\r\nhonours on other people, like Mr Josef Stalin, you will\r\n\r\nremember,  Sir,  he was honoured in the  mausoleum -   and\r\n\r\nwhen somebody took over, his bones were disinterred  and\r\n\r\nreburied elsewhere. At least in democratic countries  we\r\n\r\nhave no need to confer honours on people just because of\r\n\r\ntheir  services to the Party. In fact, very few of those\r\n\r\nwho  are  members  of  the Party have  received  honours\r\n\r\nbecause they are Party members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Devan Nair, for example, Sir, I think his\r\n\r\nname  has  been  mentioned. Apart  from  being  a  trade\r\n\r\nunionist,  he  is  a  member  of  a  number  of  Boards,\r\n\r\nincluding the Adult Education Board - a kind of service\r\n\r\nwhich  I do not think any member of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhas  ever  rendered to the people. Their  only  kind  of\r\n\r\neducation  is  to  mislead young children,  to  mobilise\r\n\r\nthem, to participate in strikes, and riots, to use  them\r\n\r\nas  cover for their own safety, to hide behind them.  At\r\n\r\nleast Mr Devan Nair, in addition to his service to  the\r\n\r\ncause   of  democracy,  in  addition  to  exposing   the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  has also done a great deal to  educate  the\r\n\r\npeople.  And these are among his many other achievements\r\n\r\nfor which there will be citations, and so will there  be\r\n\r\ncitations also for the others who have received honours.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, when the citations are made, as far as I know,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  reference to their contributions  to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. All the references will be to their contributions\r\n\r\nto  the  service  of the State, education,  welfare - and.\r\n\r\ntherefore,  I  would ask the Members of the  Barisan  at\r\n\r\nleast  not  to make these honours a matter for political\r\n\r\nfootball  here.  And, Sir, if any  Member  even  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  suddenly  decides  to   vacate   the\r\n\r\nCommunist camp ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I was wondering\r\n\r\nwhether thought has been given to whether we should have\r\n\r\nboth Federal representation in London after Malaysia and\r\n\r\nState representation as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We have given thought to this\r\n\r\nmatter,  and  as I referred the Member for Cairnhill  to\r\n\r\nparagraph\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5  of the White Paper, I similarly refer the Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park to the same paragraph, that it was agreed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Measures to protect the interest of Singapore trade\r\n\r\noverseas  will include the establishment  of  a  section\r\n\r\nwithin  any of the Federal missions as may he  necessary\r\n\r\nto deal with trade matters of Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jakarta and London are our two missions at the moment.\r\n\r\nThey  will continue after merger as part of the  Malayan\r\n\r\nEmbassy or of the Malayan High Commissioner's Office  in\r\n\r\nLondon.  And,  in  fact,  in  the  case  of  the  London\r\n\r\nrepresentative,  it may well be that  his  duties  as  a\r\n\r\nfinancial  officer of this Government may increase.  The\r\n\r\nCrown  Agents have increased their charges for  handling\r\n\r\nour matters, such as payment of pensions and hooking  of\r\n\r\npassages and advertisements for consultants and  so  on.\r\n\r\nWe  have therefore terminated the services of the  Crown\r\n\r\nAgents, and we are saving money. The Office in London is\r\n\r\nnow directly handling all payments of pensions, passages\r\n\r\nand  other  cognate  matters.  The  Federation  External\r\n\r\nAffairs   Ministry  may  well  decide  to  expand   this\r\n\r\nparticular    function    of   the    Singapore    Trade\r\n\r\nCommissioner's  Office  to include  their  Crown  Agents\r\n\r\nhandling of matters too. The other function, of  course,\r\n\r\nis  to  give  information that may  be  enquired  of  by\r\n\r\nimporters  and  exporters in London  and  general  trade\r\n\r\nenquiries. We have adverted our minds to the possibility\r\n\r\nof  getting  them completely absorbed in the  Federation\r\n\r\nExternal  Affairs Ministry, but I think, for  the  first\r\n\r\nphase,  we are convinced that we have sufficient special\r\n\r\ninterest   in  entrepot  trade  to  merit   a   separate\r\n\r\ncommercial  representative, or a Commercial  Attache  or\r\n\r\nConsul, to look after our special interests. As  far  as\r\n\r\nwe  can envisage, there are four places where ultimately\r\n\r\nwe  may want to establish a section in the Malayan  High\r\n\r\nCommissioner's Office or the Malayan Embassy abroad, and\r\n\r\nthey are Jakarta.

I  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  staff doing the work on the Malay Settlements\r\n\r\nhave  been  on a temporary basis for the last  three  or\r\n\r\nfour  years. I wonder whether it would not be convenient\r\n\r\nboth  for the Government and for the stall to have  them\r\n\r\nput on a permanent basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> First, the Malay Settlements. I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Member  for  Geylang  Serai  is  aware  that\r\n\r\nprogress  has  been  made  in  three  out  of  the  four\r\n\r\nSettlements that have been gazetted. The only one  where\r\n\r\nprogress  has  not been made is West Coast Road  because\r\n\r\nthe area has these squatters. At Kaki Bukit Phase 1, 282\r\n\r\nlots  where allocated; in Phase 2, the area on the west,\r\n\r\nwith an estimated expenditure of $30,000, it is expected\r\n\r\nthat  50 allotments will he soon available; and in Phase\r\n\r\n3,  the area to the north, on an expenditure of $400,000\r\n\r\nthere will be 376 lots available. In Sembawang, 108 lots\r\n\r\nhave  been  allotted on the 1st of June,  old  residents\r\n\r\noccupying 24 lots. And in Phase 2, 68 lots will he  made\r\n\r\navailable.  At Ayer Gemuroh, an expected expenditure  of\r\n\r\n$105,900 for constructing a sea wall and filling of  the\r\n\r\nearth  has  been set aside and in due course allocations\r\n\r\nwill  be  made, although we are not quite sure just  how\r\n\r\nmany allotments there will be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Geylang Serai, I think, as the former Deputy Chief Minister in charge of lands and the S.I.T., understands the problem acutely. There are less and less lands available for the traditional Malay house in the urban areas. The traditional Malay house is one on stilts with a hit of\r\n\r\nland  on  it for fruit trees and the rearing of poultry.\r\n\r\nAnd  in  the  Geylang  Serai Scheme  we  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nacclimatise  our  Malay population to flat-dwelling.  We\r\n\r\nhave succeeded in the case of the Police and the S.I.R.\r\n\r\nwhere  large  blocks  of  flats are  allocated,  all  to\r\n\r\nsimilar types of tenants in the same establishment,  and\r\n\r\nthey  seem to have adjusted very well. And we are trying\r\n\r\nit  out  at Geylang Serai - there are two blocks,  one\r\n\r\nblock we are hoping will be completely for Malays in the\r\n\r\narea, the other for the Chinese and the other races  who\r\n\r\nwere  displaced from the area as a result of the Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai Scheme. And, with, I hope, the co-operation of all\r\n\r\nMalay Members, if this scheme proves successful, then we\r\n\r\nare  hoping in Phase 3 of the Kaki Bukit Scheme to  have\r\n\r\nhousing  flats  instead of the traditional  Malay  rumah\r\n\r\npondok. For, on the same land where you can put up, say,100  \r\n\r\nMalay  rumah in the traditional Malay  fashion,  no\r\n\r\nless than 500 units of housing flats can be erected. And\r\n\r\nit might be arranged to give them suitable plots of land\r\n\r\nnearby for the rearing of poultry or the cultivation  of\r\n\r\nfruit trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That really is the core of the problem. I think the\r\n\r\nMember  for Geylang Serai must be honest and admit  this\r\n\r\npublicly  that  there is no hope of  solving  the  Malay\r\n\r\nhousing problem, unless we push the Malays more and more\r\n\r\ninto  the  outer  areas where there is  no  electricity,\r\n\r\nwater,  bus  services, and proper roads.  Unless  we  do\r\n\r\nthat,  the alternative is to get them to live in  flats,\r\n\r\nand I think it can be done, provided certain adjustments\r\n\r\nare  made by them and by the Housing Board, so that  for\r\n\r\nreligious and other reasons. It may be necessary that  a\r\n\r\nwhole  flat is set aside for Muslims only; as the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Geylang  Serai suggested, a corner of  the  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai Market should he set aside for sellers of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfood prepared in the Muslim way, makanan halal. So these\r\n\r\nadjustments  will  be tried, all with the  intention  of\r\n\r\ntrying  to  acclimatise the Malay kampong dwellers  into\r\n\r\nthe  urbanised conditions of Singapore. Whether we  like\r\n\r\nit or nut, this is a relentless trend and the Malays, as\r\n\r\na  group,  either  fit  in  with  the  modernisation  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  live in flats, as they are  successfully\r\n\r\ndoing  in the S.I.R. and in the Police quarters, or,  it\r\n\r\nthey  insist  on a piece of land around  the  house,  in\r\n\r\nwhich  case,  our problems will continue to become  more\r\n\r\nand  more difficult as they are pushed into the more and\r\n\r\nmore  remote areas. I do not think the Members  opposite\r\n\r\nwho  represent the Malay constituencies would like  that\r\n\r\nto happen. The Member for the Southern Islands knows the\r\n\r\nenormous  amount of effort and money that has gone  into\r\n\r\nthe Southern Islands. In Pulau Sudong, there is no water\r\n\r\nsupply.  We  have to bring water there.  More  and  more\r\n\r\nfishermen  are  catching the same fish  population, and\r\n\r\nmore and more kelongs are trapping the same fish. So the\r\n\r\nfishermen are getting less and less fish. Their children\r\n\r\nhave to go to school, It would be so much easier for all\r\n\r\nof  us if they could come and live on the mainland.  But\r\n\r\nfor various reasons, they prefer to live in the Islands,\r\n\r\nand  so  we try to make the adjustments. So it  is  with\r\n\r\nBlakang  Mati, Sambu, Tekong, Bukom and a lot  of  other\r\n\r\nplaces.  But  finally we have to face the  problem.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  simply  is, how do we help the whole  community\r\n\r\nadjust  to the new problems? I would be grateful if  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Geylang Serai would give us his co-operation\r\n\r\non this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> I am glad the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\ngiven  us the assurance that one block of flats will  be\r\n\r\nallotted to the Malays in the Geylang Serai Scheme.  But\r\n\r\nI  would also like him to consider, in the case  of  the\r\n\r\nsecond  block  of flats, where there will  be  vacancies\r\n\r\nafter  the  flats have been allocated to the  non-Malays\r\n\r\nwho  have  been  de-housed in the same area,  that  they\r\n\r\nwould be allocated to the Malays in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is with regard to the West Coast Road.\r\n\r\nHe  said  that it was not possible to proceed  with  the\r\n\r\nscheme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause of the squatter problem. But, as I know  it,  it\r\n\r\nis not so much a squatter problem as a swamp problem.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that if the Government are willing to spend some\r\n\r\nmoney,  they could reclaim no less than about  fifty  to\r\n\r\nsixty  acres  of  land in West Coast  Road  which  could\r\n\r\neasily be allocated to Malay applicants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I raised was also with regard to\r\n\r\nthe temporary staff. They have been on a temporary basis\r\n\r\nfor  the  last three years, I think, and since  this  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be a permanent feature of the administration,\r\n\r\nwould  it  not be wise for the Government to  place  the\r\n\r\nofficers on a permanent basis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is that the last point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I think eventually we will have to\r\n\r\nface  up to this problem.

It was  so when the P.A.P. came to power, \r\n\r\nbut it is not so now.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of the Land Office is one of the\r\n\r\nworst of all the Government departments. The poor people\r\n\r\nalways  go  to the department to seek help in  order  to\r\n\r\nsolve  their  problems, but when they  go  there,  their\r\n\r\nproblems  are always unsolved. There are many  instances\r\n\r\nwhich  can he quoted. When they go there, their problems\r\n\r\nare  not solved; they always see their Assemblymen.  But\r\n\r\nif   their  Assemblymen  happen  to  be  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nAssemblymen,  their  problems still  cannot  be  solved,\r\n\r\nbecause    their   Assemblymen   are   the    Opposition\r\n\r\nAssemblymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to quote a few examples that affect the\r\n\r\nlives of the people directly. According to information I\r\n\r\nhave  received, I know that there is a committee to deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  transfers  of  T.O.L.s.  and  this  Committee\r\n\r\nconsists   of   three  Parliamentary  Secretaries:   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister   for   Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor National Development. If this Committee consists  of\r\n\r\nonly  three Parliamentary Secretaries of the Government,\r\n\r\nI  wonder  whether it is fair to the people,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  people living in the rural areas who  oppose  the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You oppose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the transfer of\r\n\r\nthe  T.O.L.s is very important. As you know, the  people\r\n\r\nliving  in the kampongs, especially the old men and  old\r\n\r\nwomen,  because they are afraid something may happen  to\r\n\r\nthem,  so  they want to transfer their T.O.L.s to  their\r\n\r\nchildren. If that person first goes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  seek  help  from the Opposition Assemblyman,  and  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Member  or P.A.P. Assemblyman  knows  that  this\r\n\r\nperson  goes  to  see that Opposition  Assemblyman,  his\r\n\r\napplication will not be approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to ask the Government to make\r\n\r\nsure is that, as you know, Sir, on Crown land people are\r\n\r\nnot  allowed  to build two houses in one  lot.  But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment must be aware that the people living  in  the\r\n\r\nkampongs  are  usually poor and their  families  usually\r\n\r\nlive  in  the same place. Because they cannot build  two\r\n\r\nhouses  they  must  be allowed to extend  their  houses.\r\n\r\nUsually their application for building two houses cannot\r\n\r\nhe approved, but the application for an extension of the\r\n\r\nhouse  is  usually not approved very quickly.  It  takes\r\n\r\nmonths  to  approve the application for an extension  of\r\n\r\nthe  house.  I hope the Government in future  will  take\r\n\r\nsteps quickly and not to delay the application for  many\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to seek clarification from the\r\n\r\nGovernment, concerns boundary disputes. In kampong areas\r\n\r\nmany   people  have  boundary  disputes  because   their\r\n\r\nboundary  stones  have been lost. Because  of  this  the\r\n\r\npeople ask the Government to go there and re-survey  the\r\n\r\nland. Before the Government resurvey the land, they want\r\n\r\nto  charge a fee which the poor people cannot afford.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Government in future will not charge  any  fee\r\n\r\nbecause  that  is Crown land, and the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  to see that  there  is  no  quarrel\r\n\r\nbetween two families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth matter I want to ask the Government to help\r\n\r\nthe  people  is this. There are many people, especially\r\n\r\nthe Malays, who have illegal houses built on Crown land.\r\n\r\nThese  people live on Crown land for many,  many  years,\r\n\r\nand  suddenly they receive notices asking them  to  move\r\n\r\nfrom their land. The Government offer no alternative  to\r\n\r\nthese  people.  I  hope  when the Government  ask  these\r\n\r\npeople  to demolish their houses they will offer them  a\r\n\r\nplace to settle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Member for Punggol wish to add\r\n\r\nanything?

I am\r\n\r\nafraid that the points made by the Member for Changi are\r\n\r\nso  nebulous  that I am unable to put my finger  on  his\r\n\r\ncomplaints.  He makes a wild allegation  that  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice  is  the most inefficient of all the departments.\r\n\r\nHe  does not set out any particular instance, or set  of\r\n\r\ninstances  which justify his making such an  allegation.\r\n\r\nHe lists out his complaint No. 1 as the inability of the\r\n\r\nLand Office to deal with Assemblymen all equally because\r\n\r\nTemporary  Occupation  Licences  are  dealt  with  by  a\r\n\r\nCommittee   in   which  there  are  three  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries,  but he forgot to mention  that  there  are\r\n\r\nalso  three  officials on the same Committee. Opposition\r\n\r\nAssemblymen, such as he, are stymied in their efforts to\r\n\r\nget  things  done. Sir, I am glad that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi  can  only  cite  this  as  his  illustration  of\r\n\r\nmaladministration.  The  whole purpose  of  putting  the\r\n\r\nthree Assemblymen in charge of the T.O.L.s was to remove\r\n\r\nthe  stigma that there was some funny business going  on\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to T.O.L.s. The only thing  is  that  they\r\n\r\ncould be influenced in their duties for a consideration.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  every T.O.L. goes through this Committee  of\r\n\r\nthree  officials and three Parliamentary Secretaries  in\r\n\r\norder to protect the officials. If they are doing right,\r\n\r\nI  can  assure the Member for Changi that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nreason whatsoever why anybody who is in the right should\r\n\r\never require his services. I can also assure him that if\r\n\r\nthey are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  wrong,  his services will not  help  them.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  building  two houses on the  same  T.O.L. is\r\n\r\nsomething  which  is wrong. By the very  nature  of  the\r\n\r\nT.O.L.,  it is implicitly stated that the land would  be\r\n\r\nrequired in the immediate future for public use. And the\r\n\r\nmore families you allow on the land, the greater will be\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of the State in re-housing them. For\r\n\r\nevery  public project which has to be preceded  by  land\r\n\r\nclearance means a re-settlement programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other complaint was, and I do not know why he\r\n\r\nshould particularly mention Malays, because I think  the\r\n\r\nChinese  and  Indians are equally at fault  in  building\r\n\r\nunauthorised houses on Crown land. If the land  bailiffs\r\n\r\nare  not swift enough in their detection, the houses  go\r\n\r\nup   in   one   night   and  are  immediately   occupied - [Interruption] - old houses. The Member for Changi  knows\r\n\r\nwell  that  there is a Committee which  sat  on  it.  We\r\n\r\ndecided in 1061 that all houses up to a certain date  in\r\n\r\n1960 would be allowed, and as from that date we issued a\r\n\r\nwarning  that  houses  put  up  would  be  struck   down\r\n\r\nimmediately.  All  houses up  to  that  date  have  been\r\n\r\nallowed.  I cannot remember now off-hand that particular\r\n\r\ndate,  but  the  Member for Changi participated  in  the\r\n\r\ndeliberations in which I took the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Sir, I will be quite frank\r\n\r\nabout  this.  Two Committees have sat on this,  and  the\r\n\r\nproblem was - as you know. Mr Speaker, we brought this\r\n\r\nout  in  the last debate - how to fit the law into  the\r\n\r\nrealities  of  the situation. A man is in occupation  of\r\n\r\nland,  like  a  rubber estate. The  owner  is  still  in\r\n\r\noccupation  of the trees and he has got his  workers  to\r\n\r\ntap  them,  but the squatter uses the land for  chickens\r\n\r\nand  other  things.  I am afraid right  up  to  now  the\r\n\r\nS.A.G.'s  department  has not  been  able  to  devise  a\r\n\r\nconcept in law whereby possession is with two persons at\r\n\r\nthe  same Time. Possession is with the owner because  he\r\n\r\nis  still  tapping.  The squatter is  also  in  physical\r\n\r\npossession as licensee. But that really does  not  salve\r\n\r\nthe  problem. If you try and give to the tenant  or  the\r\n\r\nlicensee  the  tenancy of the place, then the  owner  is\r\n\r\ndebarred  from occupancy: in other words, he  no  longer\r\n\r\ntaps  the rubber. Then the rent must go up to take  into\r\n\r\naccount  the fact that the tapping of rubber is lost  to\r\n\r\nthe  owner.  But  if  the tenant cannot  pay  that  rent\r\n\r\nbecause he does not know how to tat the rubber and  make\r\n\r\nmoney on it, then the thing ends in a stalemate. Here is\r\n\r\na  concept  of  law of the absoluteness   - of  possession\r\n\r\nmeeting the technical problem of joint possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the owner who has his rubber tappers\r\n\r\ntapping and the squatter who has his chicken run in  one\r\n\r\ncorner  of  the estate and uses a large section  of  the\r\n\r\nestate for the feeding of his chickens and ducks. It may\r\n\r\nwell  be  that we may ultimately have to resolve  it  by\r\n\r\ncreating a new creature in the law - a tenancy which has\r\n\r\nnot got absolute possession. That I do not know - I do not\r\n\r\nwant  to  go into the intricacies of it. The problem  is\r\n\r\nthere  and  I raise the problem. All I can say  is  that\r\n\r\nlegally  a solution is not at present apparent. We  have\r\n\r\ndone what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  think is the best in the circumstances, namely, hold\r\n\r\nthe status quo until we find the problem to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem which I would like to mention and to\r\n\r\nwhich again we have not found the problem is the sale of\r\n\r\nflats.  We  want to work out a scheme whereby  not  only\r\n\r\nwill  the  Housing  Board  build  flats  but  they  will\r\n\r\nsubsequently sell these flats. The question is:  do  you\r\n\r\nsell  air  space  or do you sell to all the  people  one\r\n\r\nblock  of flats, who jointly own the floor space of  the\r\n\r\nground  floor,  and build upwards? Or do they  own  that\r\n\r\nparticular  sector  of the air space above  the  ground?\r\n\r\nThis  solution has been found in different countries  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  ways. In certain continental  countries,  the\r\n\r\nsolution  is to sell air space: in other words,  if  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  comes down, then the tenant of that particular\r\n\r\nfloor still owns that air space and provided you can get\r\n\r\nthe  co-operation of the other tenants,  you  can  build\r\n\r\nback with the same air space ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  would like to draw the attention of the Government to\r\n\r\nthis  fact, that if there is to be revision, which  must\r\n\r\ntake place sometime or another, then it should take note\r\n\r\nthat  the  old system on which the Master Plan has  been\r\n\r\nworked  is  not  practical  these  days.  I  refer,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, to certain areas where it is insisted that  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  house  in that area, you must have  a  minimum\r\n\r\nspace of land as the surrounding houses. In some areas,\r\n\r\nSir, which are so-called first-class areas, people built\r\n\r\nhouses  on one acre, two acres, at a time when land  was\r\n\r\nabout  10, 20, or 50 cents a square foot. Today, in  the\r\n\r\nsame  areas,  the land is about 2, 3, 4 or 5  dollars  a\r\n\r\nsquare foot, and it is no longer possible for people  to\r\n\r\nbuild houses on such big pieces of land. Because of  the\r\n\r\nscarcity  of  land  in Singapore and  also  because  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of building skywards has been accepted  by  the\r\n\r\npeople  nowadays. I think the Government should  have  a\r\n\r\nnew  system of basing their decision on how big a  space\r\n\r\nof   land  it  should  be.  In  some  cases,  Sir,  this\r\n\r\ninsistence  has made it impossible for that area  to  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out, and give as an example, one\r\n\r\narea  which  I  know of where it has made it  physically\r\n\r\nimpossible to develop that place. I will give this as an\r\n\r\nexample because I feel that as the Housing Board  builds\r\n\r\nmore  and more flats, this problem is going to  crop  up\r\n\r\nmore  and  more. One end of Ridout Road is a first-class\r\n\r\nbungalow  area where houses have been built on  one  and\r\n\r\ntwo  acres  of  land. The other end of  Ridout  Road  is\r\n\r\nwithin  hearing distance of Queenstown. It is impossible\r\n\r\nto  develop  the land there because nobody is  going  to\r\n\r\nspend  $200,000 on land alone to build a bungalow  which\r\n\r\nis within hearing distance of third-class flat buildings\r\n\r\nlike those built by the Housing Board. Therefore, it  is\r\n\r\ncausing stagnation there. As I have said, more and  more\r\n\r\nHousing  Board  houses are coming up and more  and  more\r\n\r\nareas  are  similarly  affected, and  I  feel  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should look into that when they  revise  the\r\n\r\nMaster Plan and see that certain areas are not being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprevented from developing because of impractical laws\r\n\r\nthat are being insisted on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, the\r\n\r\npurpose of the preparation of the Master Plan Documents.\r\n\r\nThey  are  for  a revised Master Plan and also  for  the\r\n\r\nwritten  statement which accompanies the Master Plan.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the problems raised by the Member for Mountbatten\r\n\r\nreally   turn  upon  the  question  of  density   limit.\r\n\r\nRevisions have taken place, and I myself must say that I\r\n\r\nam  very dissatisfied with the existing law because when\r\n\r\nwe  allow density to increase, the land owner profits by\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in density and immediately puts  up  more\r\n\r\nhousing  units  on  the  same  piece  of  land,  thereby\r\n\r\nincreasing traffic and other problems. The price of  the\r\n\r\nland  also goes up because more can be built  on  it.  A\r\n\r\nsocial  problem  is created, a burden which  has  to  be\r\n\r\nborne  by the State at large - traffic, utilities  and  so\r\n\r\non. I am seriously considering, when altering densities,\r\n\r\nat  the same time to put a premium on the alteration  of\r\n\r\ndensities to pay for all the runabouts and the  flyovers\r\n\r\nthat will be necessary in order to keep up the same rate\r\n\r\nof  flow  of  traffic with the increase  in  density  of\r\n\r\npopulation  allowed on various pieces  of  land.  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  the Member for Mountbatten that this  matter  is\r\n\r\nreceiving attention. The only problem is that there  are\r\n\r\nno  easy  precedents  that we can  follow.  The  English\r\n\r\npractice  here, on which most of our planners have  been\r\n\r\neducated,  is unsatisfactory because of the sanctity  of\r\n\r\nproperty.  If  density goes up, the land  owner  gets  a\r\n\r\nprofit  on  it.  But I do not think  that  that  is  the\r\n\r\nprinciple which should guide us because the profit  that\r\n\r\nthe land-owner makes can only become possible because of\r\n\r\nthe  burden  which the State has to carry  with  heavier\r\n\r\ndensity.  Therefore, I think it is only  fair  that  the\r\n\r\nland-owner  should not altogether derive profit  out  of\r\n\r\nincreasing density which we may ultimately have to allow\r\n\r\nin  many  of the suburban areas which the hon. Lady  has\r\n\r\npointed  out. It may have cost a few cents a  few  years\r\n\r\nago,  a  decade or two decades ago, but it is now  being\r\n\r\nsold at dollars per square\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfoot.  I  myself am not prepared to say that we  have  a\r\n\r\nready-made solution, but I am quite prepared to consider\r\n\r\nany  practical  proposition.  I  think  it  has  to   be\r\n\r\napproached  radically from the point of view of  society\r\n\r\nas  a  whole,  not the point of view of the sanctity  of\r\n\r\nproperty. And once we accept that the standpoint is  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of society as a whole and not the benefit of the\r\n\r\nindividual  owner, then the whole approach changes, and\r\n\r\nit means, of course, a basic alteration in our land laws\r\n\r\nand rates of compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\npoint out, before I withdraw my amendment, that I am not\r\n\r\ninterested in the individual or owner or the sanctity of\r\n\r\nproperty,  as  has  been  spoken  about  by  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. But I am interested that certain areas  should\r\n\r\nnot be prevented from developing. It has been brought to\r\n\r\nmy attention that certain areas have been prevented from\r\n\r\ndeveloping   because  of  impossible   requirements   of\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Lady has said something and she\r\n\r\ncannot  withdraw if what she has said calls for a reply.\r\n\r\nDoes it call for a reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes. I do not think I, can allow\r\n\r\nthat  to  pass. From Time to Time allegations have  been\r\n\r\nmade  against  the Planning Department and  I  think  we\r\n\r\ncannot  allow  these  allegations to pass  unchallenged.\r\n\r\nThey  have to be investigated because, if they are found\r\n\r\nto  be true, then obviously misdemeanour is going on and\r\n\r\nthere  is  an abuse of power. But what often happens  is\r\n\r\nthat  a  land-owner's  interest is  not  necessarily  in\r\n\r\ncoincidence with the planner's interest. The planner  is\r\n\r\ninterested  in certain deployment of use of land-varying\r\n\r\ndensities,   green   belt,  suburban  areas,   lay-outs,\r\n\r\nroundabouts  and  pieces of land.

As a road is hit through, they\r\n\r\nlike  to  build along the road. That is the easiest  way\r\n\r\nout.  But  that is not the planner's way of solving  our\r\n\r\nhousing problem, and often we do not allow it. We say if\r\n\r\nyou  want to develop, then these are the conditions.  It\r\n\r\nmay  be  that property and other sociological conditions\r\n\r\nhave  not reached that point where development can  take\r\n\r\nplace in housing estates. But that does not mean that we\r\n\r\nshould  allow  ribbon  building.  I  do  not  know  what\r\n\r\nspecific  instances  the Lady has in  mind,  but  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  her that I am fully alive to the massive  powers\r\n\r\nof  the  planner  and he has a committee which  includes\r\n\r\nmembers of the professional organisations interested  in\r\n\r\nplanning - association  of  architects  or  society  of\r\n\r\narchitects,  structural  engineers - not  the  ratepayers.\r\n\r\nThere   is  a  balancing  of  interests  and.  I  hope,\r\n\r\nsufficient checks and counter-checks to prevent  anybody\r\n\r\nfrom  getting his way, and certainly to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nplanner  (1)   discharges his duties in an unbiased  way,\r\n\r\n(2)   is also protected from malicious criticism when any\r\n\r\nparticular  group of property owners do  not  get  their\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to make\r\n\r\nit clear that I am not accusing the department at all of\r\n\r\nbeing  biased  or of malpractice, as the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nseems to think.

There is constant alteration going on  with\r\n\r\nthe Master Plan - revisions of density, changes in plan to\r\n\r\nface realities - and that is the reason for asking for the\r\n\r\nvote  of  $20,000  for the printing of this  new  Master\r\n\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his other scandalous allegation, that is exactly\r\n\r\nwhat   I  have  said.  If  they  keep  on  making  these\r\n\r\nallegations,  in  all fairness, we have  to  investigate\r\n\r\nthem,  because  it  may  well be  that  there  are  land\r\n\r\nbailiffs who have abused their position, particularly as\r\n\r\nwe have known in the past\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  their  overlooking unlawfully built houses on  Crownland.  If  you can get a land bailiff to ignore  illegal\r\n\r\nbuilding  for  48  hours, you  can  get  a  family  into\r\n\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you can get a family into residence, then the\r\n\r\nsocial  blackmail starts. He says, \"I dare you  to  move\r\n\r\nme,  my  children, my family. This is all I have got  in\r\n\r\nthe world. I am squatting here. Now lift me.\" This is  a\r\n\r\nserious problem. Hence, from time to time over the  last\r\n\r\nfew years, we have done regular switches, as they do  in\r\n\r\nthe  Customs, so that nobody really gets to settle  down\r\n\r\ninto a routine and then begins to take short cuts in his\r\n\r\nduties.  As  against that, of course,  is  the  constant\r\n\r\nproblem of the man not really knowing his area.  If  you\r\n\r\nhave  too  many  switches, the man never really  becomes\r\n\r\nfamiliar with the locality he is in charge of.  He  does\r\n\r\nnot  know  the back-lanes and the by-lanes. The  various\r\n\r\nbits and pieces and illegal buildings can well be put up\r\n\r\nand  occupied  and the tenant securely ensconced  before\r\n\r\nthis  has come to the notice of the Land Office.  But  I\r\n\r\nhave  said  that  all these allegations  of  malpractice\r\n\r\narise  out of T.O.L.s. For that reason, we have  put  up\r\n\r\nthis  Committee  of three Parliamentary Secretaries  and\r\n\r\nthree officials, the idea being to see that nobody sells\r\n\r\nor  transfers T.O.L.s which are not supposed to be  sold\r\n\r\nor transferred; and that nobody puts up another house on\r\n\r\nthe  same T.O.L., thereby increasing the burden  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  subsequent resettlement. His  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Changi, condemns this Committee.  Quite\r\n\r\nforgetting  my  reply to his colleague, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi, he said that the land bailiffs are corrupted and\r\n\r\nthat  we  should look into the matter. This  is  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  we are doing. And when we do look into the matter,\r\n\r\nand we are straight, his colleague was not satisfied. So\r\n\r\nI   do  implore  him  to  pay  some  attention  to   the\r\n\r\nproceedings  that  have  just  taken  place  before  his\r\n\r\nquestions arrive; at least he can follow up the argument\r\n\r\ninstead of having to regurgitate the same old facts in a\r\n\r\nnew form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member wishes for a vote, or to\r\n\r\nwithdraw?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng:</b> I withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $827,770 for Head 9 ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 11 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head 11-Survey.

The\r\n\r\nreason  is  that  there  is a possibility  that  further\r\n\r\ndredging  will  cause  the walls of  the  embankment  to\r\n\r\ncollapse.

If they do not have money to buy cars, of\r\n\r\ncourse, most of their cars will be emitting smoke.  When\r\n\r\nthey receive summons, the car owners will be fined,  say\r\n\r\n$20, even in the case of a first offence. This will be a\r\n\r\ngreat burden on people who own such cars. I do not  know\r\n\r\nhow  the Government will treat the larger vehicles owned\r\n\r\nby other bodies or Europeans, e.g., the S.T.C. How is it\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  is  not taking  the  same  action\r\n\r\nagainst   cars,  vehicles  or  buses  owned  by  foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists?  Instead the Government  has  taken  action\r\n\r\nagainst the cars owned by our poor people here.  To  the\r\n\r\npoor people, of course, $20 means a lot. But $20 to  the\r\n\r\nforeign  companies,  who own big vehicles,  is  a  small\r\n\r\namount. They can pay up to $200 or even more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fines imposed upon taxi drivers should also be reduced\r\n\r\nto,  say, $2. In the P.A.P. pamphlet, that is The  Tasks\r\n\r\nAhead,  at  page  5,  it is stated that  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  are mostly poor. They support us not  because\r\n\r\nwe have talents among us. They support us because of our\r\n\r\nprinciple of equality to all. I would like to point this\r\n\r\nout.  Since all the friends and relatives of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  deserted the P.A.P. it is now trying to intimidate\r\n\r\nthe  people. I would not like to waste any more Time  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly. But I would like to point out  one  more\r\n\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The car park attendants were formerly P.A.P. members.\r\n\r\nThey  had been recommended for this type of work by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. These people have a conscience. They do not  like\r\n\r\nto  toe the P.A.P. line. Now the P.A.P. is sacking every\r\n\r\none  of them, but not because they have offended against\r\n\r\nany  regulations. They merely receive notices  from  the\r\n\r\nauthorities terminating their services within 24 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to what is stated in The Tasks Ahead, the so-called equality to all is a far cry from this principle.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  these people do not like to become  running\r\n\r\ndogs  of  the  P.A.P., and because  of  this  they  were\r\n\r\nsacked.  The  P.A.P.'s way of doing things  is  a  great\r\n\r\nthreat to the staff of Government departments because if\r\n\r\nthey do not toe the P.A.P. line, they would be sacked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. is applying psychological pressure on these\r\n\r\npeople so that they are under mental torture. So I  hope\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. could give up this sort of practice  and\r\n\r\nnot  try  to  put the people under fear of losing  their\r\n\r\nbowl of rice. Formerly the P.A.P. asserted that it would\r\n\r\ndo  all  sorts  of things for the workers and  the  poor\r\n\r\npeople. But what do we see these days? I ask the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nnot  to resort to these practices again. In the past the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. said that it wanted to protect the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers. This has been one of its slogans. But  now\r\n\r\nthis has been seen through by the people. The P.A.P. is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  looking  after the interests of  the  workers.

The Member for Moulmein surely must ask  whether\r\n\r\nwe  should enforce laws that are for the benefit of  the\r\n\r\npublic  or  do  not enforce laws at all. Everybody  will\r\n\r\nagree that vehicles which emit offensive fumes from  the\r\n\r\nexhaust are a danger to public health. In fact,  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  things which we wish to prevent in Singapore is  to\r\n\r\nallow  this city to degenerate into a smoke-filled town.\r\n\r\nIt  is  well known that fumes from incomplete combustion\r\n\r\nof petrol can give rise to offensive chemicals which, if\r\n\r\nbreathed  in  for a long Time, may be a  cause  of  lung\r\n\r\ncancer;  just  as it is very much a possibility  that  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  keeps  on smoking a very  large  number  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes and inhaling the smoke may suffer  from  lung\r\n\r\ncancer,  it is in the interest of public health that  we\r\n\r\nare  enforcing  this regulation so as to make  the  city\r\n\r\nclean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolute nonsense for the Member for Moulmein to\r\n\r\nsay  that in enforcing this law, we are making the  poor\r\n\r\npeople suffer. In the first instance, poor people do not\r\n\r\nown motor cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou  can hardly say that Members of the Barisan who  are\r\n\r\nsitting opposite us today arc poor when they have  motor\r\n\r\ncars.  And  if  their motor cars should  emit  offensive\r\n\r\nsmoke,  I  have no doubt that complaints will be  lodged\r\n\r\nwith  the Registrar of Vehicles and lie will take action\r\n\r\naccordingly. However, I do not think it is the intention\r\n\r\nof  the  authorities to impose a fine on all and  sundry\r\n\r\nsimply  for the pleasure of collecting money from owners\r\n\r\nof  vehicles who are guilty of this offence. Usually, in\r\n\r\nthe first instance, a warning is given but in most cases\r\n\r\nthis  warning is not heeded and, therefore, more drastic\r\n\r\naction has to be taken. It is also incorrect 10 say that\r\n\r\nS.T.C. buses are exempted from this regulation. The  law\r\n\r\nis  applicable to every vehicle. Any person who  reports\r\n\r\non  such  and such a vehicle, whether it be a privately-owned  vehicle or whether it be a taxi or  a  bus,  will\r\n\r\nfind  that the R.O.V. will investigate the case and  the\r\n\r\nowner  of  the  vehicle  will be asked  to  produce  his\r\n\r\nvehicle  and  tests  will be made  to  see  whether  the\r\n\r\nallegation  is  true  that  offensive  smoke,  which  is\r\n\r\ndetrimental to public health, is being emitted by such a\r\n\r\nvehicle.  However,  Members  will  agree  that   it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary now and then to enforce this regulation. These\r\n\r\nregulations  are  not new regulations  which  have  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  by the P.A.P. Government. These  regulations\r\n\r\nhave  been  in  existence ever  since  the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  was  formed.  It is necessary  in  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest that these regulations must be enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the complaint by the Member for Moulmein and the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Changi that car park attendants  are  being\r\n\r\ndismissed simply because they are not P.A.P. members,  I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that  that  is an utterly  irresponsible  and\r\n\r\nmischievous charge. Car park attendants are  engaged  by\r\n\r\nthe City Council Committee, and they are taken on not on\r\n\r\naccount of their party affiliations. I am quite sure the\r\n\r\nMember  for Moulmein will know that many of the existing\r\n\r\ncar park attendants do not belong to the P.A.P. He ought\r\n\r\nto  know,  because obviously his keen interest  in  this\r\n\r\nsubject  year by year should show that many of  the  car\r\n\r\npark attendants are his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersonal friends.

I can cite  a\r\n\r\nnumber   of  instances.  For  example,  some  car   park\r\n\r\nattendants  apparently have a hatred for motorists,  and\r\n\r\none  of  their  ways  of venting  their  hatred  on  the\r\n\r\nmotorists is to make false reports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and again car park attendants have been making\r\n\r\nfalse  reports  to  the Registrar of Vehicles  that  the\r\n\r\nowner  of  such and such a car had not paid his  parking\r\n\r\nfee.  When  the report is received by the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles it is natural that his first action is to issue\r\n\r\na  summons to the owner of the car; the owner of the car\r\n\r\nappears  in  Court,  and when investigations  are  fully\r\n\r\nmade,  it  is found out that the car park attendant  had\r\n\r\nbeen  telling  a lie. This is one example  of  car  park\r\n\r\nattendants  not doing their duty; there are  others  who\r\n\r\nhave  been  dismissed on account of their  laziness.  We\r\n\r\nhave  received  many complaints from  motor-car  drivers\r\n\r\nthat they have been kept waiting for a considerable time\r\n\r\nbefore  a car park attendant comes to issue them with  a\r\n\r\nparking ticket, although the car park attendant was only\r\n\r\na  few  yards  away.  Any  car  park  attendant  who  is\r\n\r\ndismissed  is  usually asked for  an  explanation  by  a\r\n\r\nDisciplinary  Committee consisting of  officers  in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council.  This  Committee  investigates  all   the\r\n\r\ncharges made. There arc parking supervisors who do their\r\n\r\nrounds  to  watch  the  work of the parking  attendants.\r\n\r\nSometimes,  they receive reports from motorists  on  the\r\n\r\nbehaviour  of  certain parking attendants and  all  this\r\n\r\ncomes before the Disciplinary Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have 172 parking attendants at the moment and so\r\n\r\nfar,  of  this  number, only 25 have had their  services\r\n\r\nterminated. It can therefore be seen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  there  has  been  no  spite  vented  on  car  park\r\n\r\nattendants on account of their political affiliations. I\r\n\r\npersonally  have very little intimate knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\npolitical  thinking or the political prejudices  of  the\r\n\r\ncar  park attendants. I do not see them at all.  And  25\r\n\r\ntermination  of services out of a total of 172  is  very\r\n\r\nsmall  indeed. That is a number which will be in keeping\r\n\r\nnormally  with  dismissals concerned with unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also add that besides car park attendants, we\r\n\r\nhave also postmen who are employed at a lower level, and\r\n\r\nany termination of service or dismissal of a postman  is\r\n\r\ndecided  by a Disciplinary Committee which includes  the\r\n\r\nhead of the Department and sometimes this goes up to the\r\n\r\nP.S.C. level.  In the case of the car park  attendants,\r\n\r\nthe termination of their service is closely examined  by\r\n\r\na  Committee  of officers. As Minister, I  have  nothing\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  to do with their termination of  service.  I\r\n\r\nmust  once again refute the lie of the Member for Changi\r\n\r\nthat  a  car park attendant must be a Branch member,  or\r\n\r\nmust  be - what is it?  - a member of the P.A.P. in order\r\n\r\nto be employed.

Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  control over vehicles is a very great problem.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment should be very careful in going about it.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as I know, the Deputy Prime Minister has set up two\r\n\r\nCommittees   to  investigate  the  traffic  problem   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  first Committee  was  the  Bus  Service\r\n\r\nInquiry Committee which was chaired by his Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary. This Committee spent some time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  carrying out investigations into all aspects of  the\r\n\r\ntraffic problem. It also issued its Report to the Press.\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, in the Report, the  Committee\r\n\r\nsuggested many recommendations as to how to improve  the\r\n\r\nbus  service and to safeguard the passengers, especially\r\n\r\nthe  schoolchildren. But ever since the  publication  of\r\n\r\nthis  Report,  we  have not been able to  see  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has actively implemented the recommendations.\r\n\r\nWe  urge the Deputy Prime Minister to tell this House to\r\n\r\nwhat   extent  the  Government  has  carried   out   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the recommendations contained  in  the\r\n\r\nReport and what are the difficulties of those which have\r\n\r\nnot  been  carried out? Is it possible  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation immediately in this respect?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very important problem. If the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is only interested in setting up  Committees\r\n\r\nand  not  in  carrying  out the recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittees,  it is only a tactic of deception.  Sir,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as I remember, after the publication of the Report,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  also  set up  a  Taxi  Licences  Review\r\n\r\nCommittee.   This   was   done  after   the   Government\r\n\r\ntemporarily suspended the issue of taxi licences.  After\r\n\r\nsome  Time, the Government also announced that Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  are  entitled to apply for taxi  licences  but\r\n\r\nthat  they must be recommended by the taxi-owners before\r\n\r\ntheir  applications can be considered by the Government.\r\n\r\nCan  the Deputy Prime Minister tell this House how  many\r\n\r\napplications   have  been  received  by   the   Vehicles\r\n\r\nRegistration  Office  since  the  announcement  of   the\r\n\r\nReport;  how  many applications have been approved,  and\r\n\r\nhow  many applications have been rejected, and what  are\r\n\r\nthe  reasons for the rejection? I hope the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  can give a very detailed explanation  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse on this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I listened to the reply  by  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. He seems to twist the facts to  deceive\r\n\r\nthe  people by saying that I am not interested in public\r\n\r\nhealth.  But  the crux of the problem  is  that  if  any\r\n\r\naction is to be taken against cars which emit smoke,  it\r\n\r\nis the taxi-drivers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  are  the greatest offenders. The Government  cannot\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problem  by imposing  more  fines  on  taxi-drivers.  The Government should educate these people  by\r\n\r\npointing out to them that they should minimise the smoke\r\n\r\nemitting from their cars or taxis. We all know that taxi-drivers are poor people. They earn only a few dollars  a\r\n\r\nday,  and  they have to be on the alert to  avoid  being\r\n\r\nsummoned by the traffic authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister has twisted what I said by saying that I am not concerned with public health. I do not object to the enforcement of the law on traffic offenders. What I am asking is that the Government should reduce the fines, especially the fines on taxi- drivers. The fines should be reduced to two or three dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the car parking attendants, the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  said  that the  reason  why  I  was  so\r\n\r\nconcerned about those who were sacked was that they  are\r\n\r\nmy  relatives  or  friends. I come  from  the  labouring\r\n\r\nclass, and I stand on the side of the labouring class; I\r\n\r\nunderstand  their  sufferings.  Termination  of  service\r\n\r\nwithout any reason is very unjust to them. He said  that\r\n\r\nwhen  I was in the Labour Ministry, I was in close touch\r\n\r\nwith  these people.

Among those who were  sacked,  the\r\n\r\nfirst  was the Secretary of the Moulmein Branch  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. The Deputy Prime Minister also told us that  only\r\n\r\n25  were sacked.

It may well be that  if\r\n\r\nthe  plea  put  up  by  the  owner  of  the  vehicle  is\r\n\r\nsufficiently  convincing, the magistrate  may  not  even\r\n\r\nimpose  a  fine.  The magistrate could  issue  a  severe\r\n\r\nwarning, or, at the least, impose a small fine of two or\r\n\r\nthree  dollars, as suggested by the Member for Moulmein.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  we  might even think of making the  Member  for\r\n\r\nMoulmein a magistrate to sit upon these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to the questions raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Yio Chu Kang ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

[Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, there is no innuendo in my\r\n\r\nremark,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker. I  always  get  mixed  up\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two. It is true that a bus  committee  was\r\n\r\nappointed  by  me  to  study the conditions  of  service\r\n\r\nprovided  by  bus companies, and a report was  duly  put\r\n\r\nforward. This report was circulated to all bus companies\r\n\r\nand  bus unions. Now, the Member for Choa Chu Kang asked\r\n\r\nwhether  we have implemented the recommendations  stated\r\n\r\nin the report. I must say that it is a bit difficult for\r\n\r\nus   to   force   the  bus  companies  to   follow   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations made by this committee.  At  Times,  you\r\n\r\nrequire  a  stick by which you can enforce  regulations,\r\n\r\nbut  sometimes  I  think it is better  if  you  can  use\r\n\r\npersuasion rather than force to get into effect what you\r\n\r\nwant. Well, in this case, we have tried to persuade  the\r\n\r\nbus  companies and the unions to give improved  services\r\n\r\nto  the  public  and, in some instances, I  believe  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  have  been carried  out.  But  in  some\r\n\r\ninstances  they  have  not been carried  out.  This,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, is largely the responsibility of the bus owners.\r\n\r\nIf they wish to extend their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness,  they  should  see that  the  public  is  well\r\n\r\ntreated and well served.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the committee which sat on the issue of\r\n\r\ntaxi licences and taxi drivers' licences, this committee\r\n\r\nhas  not completed its investigations. I believe it sent\r\n\r\nout over 10,000 questionnaires to people who are holding\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers' licences. Many answers have come in,  and\r\n\r\nthe  R.O.V. is overwhelmed by the amount of work it  has\r\n\r\ngot to do to study the answers which have come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will be aware that there are\r\n\r\nslightly  over 3,000 taxis which are now being  operated\r\n\r\nby over 10,000 people who own taxi drivers' licences. We\r\n\r\nhave  had  complaints in the past from the taxi-drivers'\r\n\r\nunion  that business has not been good, because  of  the\r\n\r\nexcessive  number of taxis in this City. On  account  of\r\n\r\nthis  complaint, we have temporarily suspended the issue\r\n\r\nof  licences to people who wish to drive taxis. That  is\r\n\r\none  positive  way  by which we hope  to  alleviate  the\r\n\r\nplight  of  taxi-drivers, and I believe  this  has  been\r\n\r\nfavourably  received by the majority of people  who  own\r\n\r\ntaxis as well as people who drive taxis. When the Member\r\n\r\nasked  me  whether  I  could  give  him  the  number  of\r\n\r\napplications for new taxi licences and applications  for\r\n\r\nnew  taxi drivers' licences, I am afraid I am not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  here to give him the figures, because  he  has\r\n\r\nnot given me due notice that he was going to ask me this\r\n\r\nquestion.  However, I will only add that this  committee\r\n\r\nwhich  is investigating into the conditions of the  taxi\r\n\r\nservice in Singapore will carefully consider whether  it\r\n\r\nwill be advisable to increase the number of taxis or the\r\n\r\nnumber of people who wish to drive taxis. With regard to\r\n\r\nthe  latter problem of the number of people who wish  to\r\n\r\ndrive  taxis, one point of view is that really  not  all\r\n\r\nthose  who  apply for taxi drivers' licences  enter  the\r\n\r\ntrade.  Many  of  the  10,000  who  hold  taxi  drivers'\r\n\r\nlicences  are in some other profession or in some  other\r\n\r\noccupation. For example, a person may be a tinsmith,  or\r\n\r\nhe  may  be working in the Harbour Board, or he  may  be\r\n\r\nworking elsewhere, but at the same time he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarries a taxi driver's licence. In the old days, a taxi\r\n\r\ndriver's  licence was issued very readily to any  person\r\n\r\nwho  holds a driving licence and on payment of  a  small\r\n\r\nsum  of  money.  This  indiscriminate  issuing  of  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers' licences has been to the prejudice of real taxi-drivers - people who are earning a living  by  driving  a\r\n\r\ntaxi. For one thing, it makes it very difficult for  the\r\n\r\nauthorities to judge how many people are really  engaged\r\n\r\nin the taxi driving profession, and how to protect taxi-drivers  in  the  profession from excessive  competition\r\n\r\namong themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is also the complaint from some taxi-owners that the ratio of about 10,000 persons who hold\r\n\r\ntaxi  drivers'  licences to about  3,000  taxis  is  too\r\n\r\nsmall. They say that sometimes it is quite difficult for\r\n\r\nthem to find a person to drive or operate a taxi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these questions must be carefully looked into by\r\n\r\nthis  committee before a decision can be made. Obviously\r\n\r\nto  make  a  decision one way or the other is  going  to\r\n\r\nannoy  the taxi-drivers or the taxi-owners. But whatever\r\n\r\ndecision  we arrive at, it must be a fair and  just  one\r\n\r\nwhich would be in the interests of the operators as well\r\n\r\nas in the interests of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is now four\r\n\r\nyears  since  the  P.A.P. came to  office.  It  will  be\r\n\r\nremembered that as early as 1955, 1956 and in  the  days\r\n\r\nwhen  the Prime Minister, the Secretary-General  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  was  in the Opposition, a lot was talked  about\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Traction Company and the monopoly it  has\r\n\r\nin  maintaining  bus routes. I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister what steps have been taken by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  during  these  four  years  to  break   this\r\n\r\nmonopoly of the Singapore Traction Company?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we know, the Singapore Traction Company,\r\n\r\nLimited,  is  a foreign company operating  with  British\r\n\r\ncapital.

And here in Singapore, in so far as\r\n\r\nthe  bus companies are concerned, we know that the local\r\n\r\nbus companies are not allowed to operate the routes that\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Traction Company has. Sir, anyone will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  routes the Singapore  Traction  Company\r\n\r\noperates  are  the most lucrative routes  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAlthough  to  some  extent, taxi  competition  may  have\r\n\r\naffected  the revenue of the Singapore Traction Company,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  the Singapore Traction  Company  operates\r\n\r\nthe  most  lucrative routes in Singapore. And  also,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, taxi competition is also a problem to the  local\r\n\r\nChinese bus companies which operate the routes which are\r\n\r\nlargely  outside  City  limits. Also,  to  make  matters\r\n\r\nworse,  I  am  told that there is a bias  against  local\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  the  rate  of calculation  of  road  tax,\r\n\r\npassenger tax, etc, of the bus companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.

It  will  only  lead  to\r\n\r\nconfusion of the services and the competition which will\r\n\r\narise  among  the bus companies fighting  for  passenger\r\n\r\nfares  along the same route will be so keen that instead\r\n\r\nof  having a proper service there will be madness  along\r\n\r\nthis  route. If the route had been given to the  S.T.C.,\r\n\r\nit was probably because it was earlier on the scene. You\r\n\r\ncannot expect a late-comer, if it applies for the route,\r\n\r\nto  be  given the route.

I have, in fact, two  months\r\n\r\nago,   had  a  meeting  with  the  Chinese  Bus   Owners\r\n\r\nAssociation together with their solicitor. Many problems\r\n\r\nwere  raised at this meeting. We spent a whole afternoon\r\n\r\ndiscussing  these problems, and they went off  satisfied\r\n\r\nwith  my explanations. This point of monopoly was raised\r\n\r\nby  their solicitor and I asked him, \"Which part of  the\r\n\r\nS.T.C.  Ordinance  indicates that a  monopoly  is  being\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  S.T.C.?\" There  is  no  section  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance which at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  moment  says  that the S.T.C. has  a  monopoly  of\r\n\r\nroutes.

There were two propositions.  One\r\n\r\nwas  to get the bus companies to federate or amalgamate,\r\n\r\nand  the  other was for the Government to take over  all\r\n\r\nthe  bus  companies. This Government is not  anxious  to\r\n\r\nspend  or  dump several million dollars into the  second\r\n\r\nproposition  by  merely taking over  the  bus  companies\r\n\r\nwithout  the possibility of providing more opportunities\r\n\r\nfor employment to the people or even the possibility  of\r\n\r\nimproving  the  bus  services.  I  have  discussed   the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  nationalisation  of  bus  companies   with\r\n\r\nseveral   Ministers  overseas,  and  it  has  been   the\r\n\r\nexperience that when you nationalise a bus company,  for\r\n\r\nseveral years that nationalised bus company loses  money\r\n\r\nand  efficiency drops.

I\r\n\r\neven  suggested  to him that some of the  S.T.C. shares\r\n\r\nshould  be  sold to the local bus companies. I  believe,\r\n\r\naccording to my report, that approaches have been  made,\r\n\r\nbut the offer was not accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to face one simple fact, Mr Speaker, and that\r\n\r\nis  many bus companies today are not solely involved  in\r\n\r\nthe  business  of  running buses.  There  are  many  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  which  do  not try to  plough  back  whatever\r\n\r\nprofits  they  earn  into the business  of  running  bus\r\n\r\nservices.  We  find many bus companies are  involved  in\r\n\r\nputting  up housing estates, simply because it  is  more\r\n\r\nprofitable. There is also the complaint that the takings\r\n\r\nof  a bus company are not what they ought to be. And  it\r\n\r\nis  not  unnatural that any offer made by the S.T.C. to\r\n\r\nlocal  citizens that some of its shares can  `be  bought\r\n\r\ndoes not meet with very keen response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the granting of routes to bus companies,\r\n\r\nthat  is the job of the Road Licensing Authority,  which\r\n\r\nis  composed of officials. I have taken very great  care\r\n\r\nindeed  that no politicians should ever be in this  Road\r\n\r\nLicensing   Authority  so  that  applications   can   be\r\n\r\nconsidered   solely   on   their   merits,   and    that\r\n\r\nconsideration  be given to the fact that the  travelling\r\n\r\npublic  will benefit by these applications.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid before, the Member for Thomson just seeks to make a\r\n\r\npolitical issue out of this when there is none  at  all.\r\n\r\nIf he were in charge of the S.T.C. Union today, probably\r\n\r\nhe would have kept his mouth shut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>9.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I do not see how the S.T.C. Employees' Union\r\n\r\ncomes  into  the picture at all. For the information  of\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy Prime Minister, as early as 1959 when I  was\r\n\r\nstill  in the S.T.C. Employees' Union, I told the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  in the presence of Mr C. V. Devan  Nair,  of\r\n\r\nthe  necessity to break the monopoly of the  S.T.C.,  to\r\n\r\ntake over, to nationalise the bus transport industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that I raise this now has got\r\n\r\nnothing - absolutely  nothing - to  do   with   the   S.T.C.\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union. Whether I am in the S.T.C. Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion  or not in the S.T.C. Employees' Union is not  the\r\n\r\nissue.  The issue is very simple. The Government  claims\r\n\r\nto  give  priority to local capital, local industry  and\r\n\r\nwhat-not.  The Singapore Traction Company is  a  British\r\n\r\ncompany, operating with British capital, and it enjoys a\r\n\r\ngood monopoly. This is by virtue of the fact that it  is\r\n\r\na  very old company, that it is a British company,  that\r\n\r\nthe rulers of Singapore were the British. Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nhas the most lucrative routes in Singapore. There is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt about it - you can ask anybody in Singapore, and  he\r\n\r\nwill  tell  you  that the S.T.C. operates  on  the  most\r\n\r\nlucrative  routes, routes which are most  yielding.  And\r\n\r\nwhat  have the Singapore Government done to try - as  they\r\n\r\nalways say they want to - to encourage local companies  to\r\n\r\nflourish? The Deputy Prime Minister merely says  in  law\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  monopoly. But in practice, there  is.  He\r\n\r\nknows  as  well  as anyone else that there  are  certain\r\n\r\nroutes  on  which the local companies cannot  ply  their\r\n\r\nbuses.  And  from  time  to time  local  companies  have\r\n\r\nobjected to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I am\r\n\r\nquite sure the S.T.C. is quite willing to pass over  its\r\n\r\nshares to loca1 capital. In fact, it was only too  eager\r\n\r\nat one time to get the company off its hands. That would\r\n\r\nmean  not only the disruption of bus services, but  also\r\n\r\nthrowing several thousand workers out of jobs. If  there\r\n\r\nis  abundant local capital doing nothing, then the  best\r\n\r\nthey could do would be to invest in industry which would\r\n\r\nprovide  bigger  opportunities for  employment  for  our\r\n\r\npeople.  That is the pressing problem. I do not see  how\r\n\r\nnationalising  the S.T.C. or local capital  taking  over\r\n\r\nthe  S.T.C. can  create more jobs.

I asked the Deputy Prime Minister a very  simple\r\n\r\nquestion,  whether he knows there is a  different  basis\r\n\r\nused as between the S.T.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  local  bus  companies in assessing  royalties.\r\n\r\nObviously, he does not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the Deputy Prime Minister says that the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore do not have enough money to take over  the\r\n\r\nproperties  and  shares of the S.T.C. I personally  feel\r\n\r\nthat  in  saying  this  he is perhaps  disregarding  the\r\n\r\ncapacity of the people of Singapore. As far as we  know,\r\n\r\nin  the  fields  of  transportation,  this  s  the  most\r\n\r\nlucrative line. If the S.T.C. had been prepared to  sell\r\n\r\nall  its  shares  to  the people of  Singapore,  then  I\r\n\r\nbelieve overnight all the shares would have been  bought\r\n\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that, as far as I know, the S.T.C.,\r\n\r\nat  the  present moment, is paying taxes on a  different\r\n\r\nbasis  from  that  of  the Chinese  bus  companies.  The\r\n\r\nChinese  bus  companies have to pay taxes  once  in  six\r\n\r\nmonths,  whereas in the case of the S.T.C., their  basis\r\n\r\nis  different. If a bus from the S.T.C. is on  the  road\r\n\r\nfor  six  hours, then tax will have to be paid  only  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of those six hours. So from this, you  can  see\r\n\r\nthat  the  companies of the suzerain country  have  been\r\n\r\ngiven special privileges over others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the routes of the S.T.C. have\r\n\r\nalready  encroached  on  the  routes  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese  bus  companies. That is why great  losses  have\r\n\r\nbeen  suffered by the Chinese bus companies.  Obviously,\r\n\r\nwe  know  that the P.A.P.

As I pointed out very clearly,\r\n\r\nin  so far as the bus routes are concerned, this is  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  an  independent Road Licensing  Authority,\r\n\r\nwhich  judges the merits of each application  and  which\r\n\r\nhears  any  objection.

I do not think the public want to  see\r\n\r\nS.T.C. buses,  Green Bus Company buses,  Hock  Lee  Bus\r\n\r\nCompany buses and Changi Bus Company buses, all racing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  another down Nicoll Highway to look for passengers.\r\n\r\nThat  will  only  bring confusion in the  bus  services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a minute.

It has been our policy to assist the\r\n\r\nfarmers,  to  help them increase production,  to  reduce\r\n\r\nproduction  costs,  so  that their  farm  produce  could\r\n\r\nbecome competitive not only against foreign imports sold\r\n\r\nin  the  local market but could also compete  in  export\r\n\r\nmarkets. This achievement can be borne\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  by the fact that in 1962 we exported 12,000 locally\r\n\r\nproduced pigs, 68 million locally produced hen eggs, and\r\n\r\nabout   2  million  locally  produced  poultry  to   our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries. Prior to 1959 we were not  self-sufficient.  What  is  the reason that  has  transformed\r\n\r\nSingapore  from an importing country into  an  exporting\r\n\r\none  in agricultural produce? The simple answer is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  farmers have been able to  produce  not  only\r\n\r\nenough  for home consumption but also to have a  surplus\r\n\r\nfor  export, and not only have a surplus for export, but\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  production has been  reduced  to  such  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  level  that  they  could  sell  Singapore's\r\n\r\nagricultural   produce   on  foreign   markets   against\r\n\r\ncompetition  from foreign imports and local products  of\r\n\r\nthese foreign markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago a question was asked in one of the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assemblies in the Borneo territories  as  to\r\n\r\nwhy   they  had  to  import  Singapore  eggs  into  that\r\n\r\nterritory.  The  answer  was that  Singapore  eggs  were\r\n\r\ncheaper  than the locally produced eggs in Borneo.  What\r\n\r\ndo  all  these  facts show? They show  that  Singapore's\r\n\r\nfarming  activities have expanded tremendously over  the\r\n\r\nlast few years, making it possible to produce enough for\r\n\r\nhome  consumption as well as a surplus  for  export.  It\r\n\r\nalso  shows that the cost of production of farm  produce\r\n\r\nin  Singapore has been reduced to such a level  that  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  able to compete effectively not only  in  the\r\n\r\nlocal market but also in foreign markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would not want to claim all the credit\r\n\r\nfor this advance and expansion of farming activities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Singapore   farmers   are   hard   working,\r\n\r\nintelligent and are very receptive in adopting new ideas\r\n\r\nin  modern farming activities. And the agricultural  and\r\n\r\nveterinary  services  provided  by  the  Government  are\r\n\r\nsecond to none in South-East Asia.

To assist farmers to reduce the  cost  of\r\n\r\nproduction  by cutting down losses of livestock  through\r\n\r\nmortality   and   sickness,   the   Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  vaccinated 11.5 million heads of poultry  in\r\n\r\n1962, as compared with 6.7 million heads in 1959, nearly\r\n\r\ndoubling the figure in only three years. In addition,  a\r\n\r\nnew   service  to  protect  young  chicks  from  getting\r\n\r\nranikhet  disease was initiated in 1961. The  Government\r\n\r\nalso  built  more veterinary centres in the rural  areas\r\n\r\nwhere   poor  facilities  existed  before  1959.   These\r\n\r\nveterinary centres bring the very services to  the  very\r\n\r\ndoorsteps  of  the  farmers,  and  each  centre  has   a\r\n\r\nveterinary   surgeon  and  a  team  of  six   to   seven\r\n\r\nsubordinate  officers  permanently  stationed  there  to\r\n\r\nassist  the farmers. Since 1959 three more centres  have\r\n\r\nbeen  built, three are under construction and  two  more\r\n\r\nwill be built next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from veterinary surgeons engaged in research and\r\n\r\nother   veterinary  services,  there   are   now   seven\r\n\r\nveterinary  surgeons working full-time on the  treatment\r\n\r\nof farm animals and poultry in the rural areas alone, as\r\n\r\ncompared to only one full-time surgeon in 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Point of elucidation, Mr Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I shall be very grateful if the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  elucidate whether or not he  is  reading\r\n\r\nexcerpts  from  the  Annual Report of  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development.

Mr Minister, please continue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, apart from veterinary surgeons\r\n\r\nengaged  in  research  and other veterinary  activities,\r\n\r\nthere  are  now seven veterinary surgeons working  full-time on the treatment of farm animals and poultry in the\r\n\r\nrural  areas alone, as compared with only one  full-time\r\n\r\nsurgeon in 1959. The number of livestock treated  was  2\r\n\r\nmillion in 1962 as compared with half a million in 1960.\r\n\r\nIt  is the Government's intention to build more of these\r\n\r\nveterinary  extension centres in the rural  areas  where\r\n\r\nveterinary services are needed, and it is also  intended\r\n\r\nto organise a veterinary mobile unit to provide services\r\n\r\nto farmers in Pulau Ubin, Pulau Tekong, and the Southern\r\n\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the disease incidence in livestock has reduced\r\n\r\nconsiderably due to these animal treatment services  and\r\n\r\nthe  sale of veterinary drugs to farmers at cost  price.\r\n\r\nThe sale of $18,000 worth of drugs in 1959 compared with\r\n\r\n$80,000  worth in 1962 reflected how much more Singapore\r\n\r\nfarmers have become conscious of utilising modern  drugs\r\n\r\nto  reduce  livestock losses and to reduce the  cost  of\r\n\r\nproduction. This year the Government also intends to set\r\n\r\nup   a   veterinary  diagnostic  laboratory  to   combat\r\n\r\nlivestock diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who have been to the rural areas recently\r\n\r\nwould  be  struck  by  the change  in  animal  husbandry\r\n\r\nmethods  used by the farmers. In the past,  poultry  and\r\n\r\npigs  have  been reared on a free range  basis  and  the\r\n\r\nanimals  fend  for themselves. Through the demonstration\r\n\r\nand  advice  given by the Primary Production Department,\r\n\r\nmany  farmers  are now adopting labour saving  and  cost\r\n\r\nreducing  devices such as rearing poultry in  cages  and\r\n\r\nrearing pigs in simple\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhygienic pig sties. Through the efforts and research  of\r\n\r\nthe Primary Production Department into animal nutrition,\r\n\r\nmany  farmers are now feeding their livestock on  a  dry\r\n\r\nfeed basis using well balanced rations which will ensure\r\n\r\nmaximum  production at minimum cost. To assist vegetable\r\n\r\nfarmers,   the  Department  has  initiated  a  ploughing\r\n\r\nservice to save the farmers a lot of Time and hard work,\r\n\r\nand  an  anti-pest service to help the farmers to combat\r\n\r\nagricultural  pests  and  plant  diseases  with   modern\r\n\r\ninsecticides   and  fungicides  using  modern   spraying\r\n\r\nimplements. We have also recently initiated  a  sale  of\r\n\r\nfertiliser  service  to help the farmers  to  use  these\r\n\r\ncheap  and effective fertilisers in order to reduce  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  production. It is also the  intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  produce  improved  seeds  and   planting\r\n\r\nmaterials  for  distribution  to  farmers  in  order  to\r\n\r\nimprove the yield and to reduce the cost of production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that these agricultural services\r\n\r\nwere  not  available to the farmers of Singapore  before\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government came to power. Recently a Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Extension Unit has been established  in  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  with  the  object of  bringing  the  various\r\n\r\nprimary  production services even closer to the farmers.\r\n\r\nIt  will  bring  a knowledge of improved  techniques  of\r\n\r\nfarming  to  the farmers through illustrated  talks  and\r\n\r\nfilms  on  all aspects of primary production. Handbills,\r\n\r\npamphlets,  booklets on these subjects  are  also  being\r\n\r\nproduced for distribution to farmers so that they may he\r\n\r\nacquainted    with   all   the   up-to-date   production\r\n\r\ntechniques. Primary Production Department personnel will\r\n\r\nalso   be  able  to  apprise  the  Government   of   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties and problems faced by the farmers  so  that\r\n\r\nnew schemes could be formulated to assist them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be seen from the above, the Government has\r\n\r\nspared  no  effort in trying to assist the farmers,  and\r\n\r\nnobody in his right mind could accuse the Government  of\r\n\r\nwant of trying to better the lot of the farmers, to help\r\n\r\nThem increase production and reduce production costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that in 1958 the total number of Government\r\n\r\nofficers,  including  monthly  and  daily-rated   staff,\r\n\r\nengaged in primary production work was 236 compared with\r\n\r\n1963 when the total strength of personnel in the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department increased to 434 persons,  nearly\r\n\r\ndoubling  the strength of the establishment strength  in\r\n\r\n1958,  shows that the Government is very concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of  the rural communities.  As  the  rural\r\n\r\ncommunities have been neglected by past governments,  we\r\n\r\nare  now  doing  everything possible to help  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople  and  to  develop the rural  areas  in  order  to\r\n\r\nrectify the mistakes and neglect of past governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nevery time the P.A.P. Minister gives reports on figures.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why they are afraid of their lies. The present\r\n\r\ncondition  is  also  caused by  the  concept  of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters.  I  have  here a Sin Chew Jit  Poh  newspaper\r\n\r\nreport  dated  the  4th of June. It touches  on  certain\r\n\r\nmerchants  dealing in animal feed. They are  faced  with\r\n\r\nbusiness  difficulties,  and  they  convened   a   Press\r\n\r\nconference  and issued this report. This  clearly  shows\r\n\r\nrural  difficulties. I will just quote from it  here  to\r\n\r\nshow you:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Chinese Animal-Feed Merchants Association convened\r\n\r\na  press conference, the Chairman of which said that the\r\n\r\ncommittee of this Association had a meeting on the  13th\r\n\r\nof  this month at which the question of dropping  prices\r\n\r\nof  eggs  was discussed. The rural economic  bankruptcy\r\n\r\nand crisis were discussed too. Many merchants dealing in\r\n\r\nthis line and farmers were meeting with difficulties.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did they mention all this? I would like to tell\r\n\r\nyou. These merchants are dealing in animal feed which is\r\n\r\nsupplied to the farmers. If the prices of their  produce\r\n\r\nare lower than the cost, then they will lose money. They\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  calculate how much they  can  pay  these\r\n\r\nmerchants. There are certain merchants who are  able  to\r\n\r\nsupply  these goods on credit to them, and  the  farmers\r\n\r\nwill  have to calculate what is the amount they will  be\r\n\r\nable  to produce every month in order to cover the cost.\r\n\r\nThe  present situation is that when prices drop, farmers\r\n\r\nwill  not be able to pay for the supplies they get  from\r\n\r\nthe merchants, thus leading to their economic bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe middlemen too have become bankrupt  because\r\n\r\nof this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has talked about setting up various veterinary stations and surveying teams in the rural area. These are not fundamental solutions. On the face of all this, they look very nice. If the Minister goes down to the rural areas, he can find that everywhere chicken sheds are in a very bad condition. Because of the poor market, the farmers cannot maintain the repair\r\n\r\nof these sheds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell you more about the prices of eggs.\r\n\r\nRecently  the price of an egg has dropped to  six  cents\r\n\r\neach.  This is the first Time in postwar years that  the\r\n\r\nprice  of eggs has fallen to such a low level. Normally,\r\n\r\nin  postwar years, an egg costs about 10 cents. Even  in\r\n\r\nthe  Lim  Yew Hock Government's Time, it was about  nine\r\n\r\ncents  per  egg. Now under the P.A.P., it  is  only  six\r\n\r\ncents.  The  farmers are therefore unable to meet  their\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the chicks are mostly meant for\r\n\r\nthe  table.  The  selling price is about  90  cents  per\r\n\r\nkatty.  Chicks must be fed for about four or five months\r\n\r\nbefore  they can be sold at $2 each. So let the Minister\r\n\r\ncalculate  how much the cost is and how much  the  price\r\n\r\nis,  and  then  he will know whether any profit  can  be\r\n\r\nmade. For instance, a pig will cost about $80 per picul.\r\n\r\nBut  the piglings will have to be fed for about  six  or\r\n\r\nseven  months  before they can be sold as  fit  for  the\r\n\r\ntable at a price that cannot meet the cost. That is  why\r\n\r\nI   would   like  to  ask  the  Minister  for   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment how he is going to solve the difficulties in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, a\r\n\r\nlittle  while  ago,  we  have  heard  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development reading the Annual Report  of  his\r\n\r\nDepartment,   showing   the   grand   achievements   his\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  made. But he has forgotten  one  thing.\r\n\r\nToday,  the  present Government, in the field  of  rural\r\n\r\nprimary  production  services,  is  only  treating   the\r\n\r\nsymptoms  but not the disease itself. The Government  is\r\n\r\nonly  buying more stud pigs and is setting up a few more\r\n\r\nveterinary stations here and there. Can this  raise  the\r\n\r\nliving standard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the farmers? There is grave doubt about this. We all\r\n\r\nknow  that the prices of domestic animals are  very  low\r\n\r\nand  they  are usually sold at a price that cannot  meet\r\n\r\nthe  cost.  I  believe the Political  Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister himself is keeping  hens  to  lay\r\n\r\neggs.  But he does not make money out of this.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I  say  the  Government is not tackling  the  basic\r\n\r\nproblems.  The Government is only treating the  symptoms\r\n\r\nbut  not  the  disease.  What the Government  should  be\r\n\r\nconcerned with is how to enable the farmers to have good\r\n\r\nprices for their agricultural produce in order to better\r\n\r\ntheir livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I quite\r\n\r\nappreciate  what  the Minister for National  Development\r\n\r\nhas read with regard to the so-called grand achievements\r\n\r\nof  the Government in the rural areas. But what he  says\r\n\r\ndoes  not  provide us with anything new at  all.  If  we\r\n\r\ncompare what he has said just now with what he said last\r\n\r\nyear,  with  regard to the budget of his  own  Ministry,\r\n\r\nthen  we can see that there is not much difference. This\r\n\r\nis actually the same as white-washing an old house. This\r\n\r\nis  only  what the Government can do so far  and  it  is\r\n\r\nclaiming much credit for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when the P.A.P. candidates took part in the elections in 1959, all the voters in the rural constituencies supported the P.A.P. in office because they believed that the rural development plans of the P.A.P. would ultimately improve the lot of the rural people, especially poultry farmers and farmers in general. Under those circumstances, the people in the\r\n\r\nrural constituencies gave them full-hearted support  and\r\n\r\nattached  great hopes to the P.A.P., praying that  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood  would be improved eventually. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. at  that Time did give very good  and  practical\r\n\r\nplans  for the improvement of the rural people. In fact,\r\n\r\nif the P.A.P. Government had done something practical to\r\n\r\nthese  plans, they would have indeed raised the standard\r\n\r\nof   living   of  the  rural  people.  So  it   is   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Minister for National  Development\r\n\r\nto implement all the plans that were promised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  rural  people  in 1959  during  the  general elections. Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nhowever, from the reply  given by  the  Minister  concerned and the work \r\n\r\ndone  by  the P.A.P. during the past four years, it can he seen  that the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  especially the Minister  for  National Development, \r\n\r\nhas not given full-hearted attention to the development of the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let us look now at the booklet of the P.A.P. during the general election concerning the development of the rural areas.\r\n\r\nIt is The Tasks  Ahead, volume  1, paragraph 3. One of the paragraphs here \r\n\r\nsays that: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is our aim to encourage the establishment of co-operative\r\n\r\nsocieties of the farmers  and  to  give  them financial  assistance, \r\n\r\nso that  co-operative  societies will  replace  the  farmers' own ways of\r\n\r\nbuying  animal feeds  and  fertilisers. In this way,  the  co-operative \r\n\r\nsocieties  will  be able to buy cheaply the  fertilisers and  then  resell\r\n\r\nthem  to the  farmers  without  great profit.  And  then by and by the\r\n\r\nco-operative  societies will  be able to build up their own capital so that \r\n\r\nthe farmers will no longer be exploited by the middle man In the purchase \r\n\r\nof the feeds and fertilisers.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the departments under the Minister for National Development, as far as I know, include one\r\n\r\nso-called  co-operative society division. But what I  would like  \r\n\r\nto know from the Minister concerned is this.  What has this co-operative \r\n\r\ndivision of the P.A.P. done during the  past four years? What has it done \r\n\r\nin respect of co-operative  society establishments? Has the  P.A.P. done\r\n\r\nits  best  to  foster the establishment of  co-operative organisations among\r\n\r\nthe farmers? Mr Speaker, the answer is  very  obvious. It is emphatically no. \r\n\r\nIt is entirely no.  If  there had been any achievements in this  field,\r\n\r\nthen  when  the  Member for Jalan  Kayu  raised  certain queries,\r\n\r\nthey should have been answered accordingly.  In fact,  there  would \r\n\r\nhave been no necessity  for  him  to raise  such  queries.  So we can see \r\n\r\nclearly  that  the Minister for National Development has not spent all  \r\n\r\nhis Time  and  made use of all the departments available  to implement\r\n\r\nthe election pledges of the P.A.P. That is why up  to the present moment\r\n\r\nthe lot of the farmer is still very bad and remains unimproved.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  no doubt the Minister has been  able  to quote a great number\r\n\r\nof figures in order to tell us that the Ministry of National Development \r\n\r\nand he himself have done  a  great  deal  to improve the livelihood  of  \r\n\r\nthe farmers  His  explanation is  that  there  has  been  an increase in\r\n\r\nthe produce of the farmers over these years. But  one  must  not forget\r\n\r\none fact. In  the  past  four years,   there  has  been  a  tremendous  \r\n\r\nincrease   in population  in  the  rural  areas.  When  the   farmers'\r\n\r\nchildren leave school, they could not find jobs  in  the factories. The \r\n\r\nonly thing for these people to do  is  to crowd  round their vegetable \r\n\r\ngardens in order  to  raise their  crops and thereby provide a livelihood \r\n\r\nfor  their own family.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not deny there has been an increase in\r\n\r\nfarm produce.  But this does not mean that the livelihood  of the  farmers\r\n\r\nhas  improved. This is  because  increased production  is closely related \r\n\r\nto the cost of production and  the  selling price of agricultural produce.\r\n\r\nSo  it would  be a grave mistake if you only talk of the volume of production\r\n\r\nwithout taking into consideration the cost of  production and the selling \r\n\r\nprice of farm produce.  I believe  his  colleague, the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nwill not base this as his logic and say that this is proof of the improvement\r\n\r\nof the livelihood of the farmers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for National Development has also mentioned other matters connected with his\r\n\r\nMinistry.  Bust he has not been able to  show  from  his speech  that \r\n\r\nthe promises made by the P.A.P. in  those days  have been fulfilled. \r\n\r\nWhen the Minister for Finance made  his Budget Speech, he was very proud of \r\n\r\nThe  Tasks Ahead  of  the  P.A.P.  But the  Minister  for  National \r\n\r\nDevelopment  has  made no mention of  the  P.A.P.'s  The Tasks  Ahead.\r\n\r\nThat means that he himself knows that  the Ministry  of National Development\r\n\r\nhas not done what  the P.A.P. has  promised.  For example,  Mr  Speaker,  \r\n\r\nthe Government promised to set up a model fisheries  village in  order  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  poor fishermen  improve  their livelihood.  There is a Fisheries\r\n\r\nDepartment  under  the Ministry  of National Development. But I would  like\r\n\r\nto ask this question. Has the Fisheries Department  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone  anything? Has the Minister himself fulfilled the promise by making \r\n\r\nthe Fisheries Department carry out the promise made during the elections? \r\n\r\nThe answer is no. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, from all the available facts, one can see that the Minister for National Development should be ashamed of the answer\r\n\r\nthat he has given us.  He  should not  be  proud of what he has said.\r\n\r\nIn the past, he  has talked  about  the allocation of goats to  the  \r\n\r\nSouthern Islands.  But  I  have not as yet seen  him  making  any report\r\n\r\non the work of distributing goats to the  people of the Southern Islands.\r\n\r\nThere has been no report on the rearing  of goats in the Southern Islands.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the progress  made in this respect? If there  has  been  any \r\n\r\nprogress and success in this field, I am quite sure, Mr Speaker, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor National Development would not have  neglected this aspect of his \r\n\r\nachievements. So  one can  see  very  clearly  that he  has  not  been  \r\n\r\npaying attention   to  the  livelihood  of  the   farmers   and fishermen.\r\n\r\nNeither has he carried out the promises  made by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the present lot of the rural people is extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nThey are in great misery. The  eggs produced  by  the farmers are taxed \r\n\r\nif they  are  to  be exported   from   Singapore  to  the   Federation.  \r\n\r\nThe Government has not been able to explain why that  should be  so. \r\n\r\nNeither has it been able to pacify the  farmers over  this  matter. \r\n\r\nAll that the Government can  say  is that on the advent of the common market,\r\n\r\neverything will be solved. This actually amounts to drawing a biscuit on the \r\n\r\nwall,  and telling you that the biscuit is  on  the wall  and  \r\n\r\nthat you can enjoy it. But, as  a  matter  of fact,  a biscuit on the wall \r\n\r\nis of no use to the stomach at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if the Minister for National Development wants to establish confidence among the farmers\r\n\r\nin  all the departments under him, then I think he should go all out to \r\n\r\nimplement the promises made. It is no use for him to boast about figures.\r\n\r\nThey are not very useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is fully aware of\r\n\r\nthe difficulties now being experienced by farmers,  particularly those \r\n\r\nengaged in the  rearing  of poultry.  My  Ministry  and  the  Ministry \r\n\r\nof  National Development   have  been  keeping  the  position   under \r\n\r\nobservation for quite some time. It is quite unnecessary for Members of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan opposite to make reckless and unfounded charges. You will \r\n\r\nremember, Mr Speaker,  Sir, that towards the end of last year and the \r\n\r\nfirst month or two  of this year, the farmers were experiencing an even\r\n\r\nmore  difficult time than they are passing through  now. At  that  time, \r\n\r\nthe reason was largely due  to  certain measures  taken by the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the  Federation  of Malaya when it restricted the\r\n\r\nexport of eggs and poultry from  Singapore to the Federation. That matter,\r\n\r\nyou will remember, Sir, was solved in a very satisfactory way and brought \r\n\r\nimmediate  improvement  to  the   economy   of Singapore's  poultry farmers.\r\n\r\nNow they are  experiencing difficulties partly because of the fall in the\r\n\r\nprice  of eggs. We are fully aware of the reasons for this decline in \r\n\r\nprices, and measures to meet the situation are  well in  hand  and  \r\n\r\npreparation of these measures  is  in  an advanced  stage. It is merely \r\n\r\na matter of  examining  to what  extent  the present decline in the price\r\n\r\nof  eggs reflects  the basic imbalance or disequilibrium  in  the supply \r\n\r\nand demand position, and to what extent it is due to  temporary factors. \r\n\r\nIt is an experience common to all countries  because prices of agricultural\r\n\r\nproducts -   not only  eggs - are extremely sensitive to changes in  supply and\r\n\r\ndemand. Other countries also have experienced a very rapid and catastrophic \r\n\r\ndecline in prices of agricultural products. This is inherent in many \r\n\r\nagricultural products because  of  the  delicate balance  between  supply\r\n\r\nand demand.  The  measures that are required to improve  the situation are\r\n\r\nfairly easy to carry out. But, at the same time, we must remember that\r\n\r\nwe have to take into account not  only  the  livelihood of the farmers \r\n\r\nbut  also  the effect on the consumers in general. It is quite easy  to \r\n\r\nbring about a high level\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   prosperity  for  farmers  by,  \r\n\r\nsay,   creating   an artificial shortage of food-stuffs.\r\n\r\nThe farmers would do very  well;  they  would make a lot of money. \r\n\r\nBut  that would be at the expense of other people who have to  pay high \r\n\r\nprices  for  food.  That  obviously  is  not   the desirable  thing,\r\n\r\nbecause it means that you  are  really shifting prosperity from one \r\n\r\nsector of the population to the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, measures  to remedy  the  situation  are  in  an  advanced  stage  of\r\n\r\npreparation  and  will be carried out  in  the  not  too distant future. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make this point here because I want to make it clear that when these\r\n\r\nmeasures are carried  out,  they  are entirely  measures undertaken by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  the interests of the farmers. They do not at all reflect  \r\n\r\nin the slightest degree anything that is said by Members of the  Barisan \r\n\r\nopposite, because what they have  told  us today   is  nothing  new.  \r\n\r\nFurther,  they  have  grossly distorted  the  picture  to the extent \r\n\r\nthat  they  have deliberately neglected to give a proper picture  of \r\n\r\nthe measures  that the Government has taken in the past  and is taking\r\n\r\nand is continuing to take and will continue to take in the future in the\r\n\r\ninterests of the farmers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is very\r\n\r\neasy  for Members of an irresponsible Opposition to make political capital \r\n\r\nout  of  the  hardships of  a  section  of  the population. It is easy to\r\n\r\nblame the decline of prices of eggs  on  the wickedness of the Government,\r\n\r\nbut such  an argument  can  only  deceive little  children,  and  the \r\n\r\nimmature  minds which make up the bulk of the  followers of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. They will not deceive any adult with any brains to think, \r\n\r\neyes to see, and ears to hear. Just  as  in  the same way. Mr Speaker, \r\n\r\nSir,  we  have Members  of an irresponsible Opposition saying that \r\n\r\nthe present  water shortage is duo to acts of negligence  of the\r\n\r\npresent  Government, when it has been  demonstrated clearly  by facts\r\n\r\nand figures that if there was any  one person who was responsible  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor past neglect in the carrying development schemes for water  in  \r\n\r\nadvance,  that  one person  former  Mayor  of Singapore, at the Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I advise the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nnot to shed any crocodile tears on  behalf  of farmers   whom  they  \r\n\r\nclaim  quite  wrongly  have   been neglected by the Government? \r\n\r\nThe position is being  kept under  close  observation, and measures to \r\n\r\ncorrect  the situation are in hand, and they will be taken at a  \r\n\r\ntime of our choosing and not at a time when these foolish and immature \r\n\r\nyoung irresponsible politicians think  that  we should.  And,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  when  we  take  those measures, not only will the measures and the \r\n\r\ntiming  and the  manner in which they are carried out be made  clear to \r\n\r\nthem but they will also see the purpose behind it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, we know that the policy of the P.A.P. concerning\r\n\r\nfarmers and fishermen is to  help them increase their daily produce.\r\n\r\nBut what  do we  see now? The fishermen and farmers are now suffering\r\n\r\nvery much, and I want to know whether the Government has any plan to \r\n\r\nhelp them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is true the Government has built quite a\r\n\r\nnumber of veterinary centres in the villages, but it  is not  enough\r\n\r\nbecause the daily produce  of  the  farmers still cannot be increased.\r\n\r\nFor the fishermen it is  even worse.  The policy of the Government to\r\n\r\nhelp the farmers and  fishermen  has failed. The plan to  set  up \r\n\r\na  co-operative society has not been carried out by the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\nThis plan is stated in The Tasks  Ahead  of the P.A.P. Most of the people\r\n\r\nliving in the kampongs earn their living by rearing poultry and planting\r\n\r\nvegetables. The  Government  does not help them but only  make  them suffer. \r\n\r\nIt  can be seen in the case of Toa Payoh  where many people earn their living\r\n\r\nin the way I stated above. These people have now been forced to move out from\r\n\r\ntheir houses and to live in places which they cannot afford. I hope\r\n\r\nthat before the Government collapses, it  will  do something for the\r\n\r\nfarmers and the people.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister\r\n\r\nwish  to  wind  up?

Sir,\r\n\r\nregarding the items under the Head Ministry of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, Members of the Barisan Sosialis  have  made\r\n\r\nmany  allegations. They pretend that they are  champions\r\n\r\nof   the   farmers.  Although  they  come   from   rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  they  very seldom  go  to  their  rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies. If they should go to the rural areas, it\r\n\r\nis only for their own individual benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on any matter, theory is one thing and\r\n\r\npractice is another thing. Members of  the  Barisan Sosialis \r\n\r\ncan  put forward many beautiful  theories  but when  they want \r\n\r\nto put them into practice, they can only draw biscuits on the \r\n\r\nwall to satisfy their hunger. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding farming activities in the rural areas, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  understand the background to these  activities\r\n\r\nand  the background to all the occupations in Singapore.\r\n\r\nFarming is only a secondary industry, and that is why we\r\n\r\nhave  to  push  forward  our  industrialisation  scheme.\r\n\r\nWithout industrialisation, to whom can you sell eggs and\r\n\r\npoultry?  If  there  had been more blank  votes  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  last  year, perhaps the farmers  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen   more  miserable  this  year.  They  cannot   even\r\n\r\nunderstand a simple and fundamental issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to see that the increase in farm produce is in\r\n\r\nkeeping  with the increase of population.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nresult of farmers using modern techniques of production.\r\n\r\nIf there has been an increase in their produce, the only\r\n\r\nproblem is the problem of marketing their produce. If we\r\n\r\nwere  to  talk only without devising a method to  expand\r\n\r\nour  markets,  it  would not help. The Members  opposite\r\n\r\nalways talk of helping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe farmers, but when we carry out construction of roads\r\n\r\nand  bridges in the rural areas, they make use of  their\r\n\r\nunited   front  organisations,  such  as  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nCountry  People's Association, to frustrate and obstruct\r\n\r\nour work. Can they say that they are helping the farmers\r\n\r\nin  this way? Can they deny what they have done? As  far\r\n\r\nas  I know, when we carry out some schemes, many persons\r\n\r\npretend  to be farmers, but when we want to check  their\r\n\r\nidentity cards, they all run away. These are facts.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to waste the time of this House, but I\r\n\r\nwish only to rebut their argument. That is the end of my\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister like to wind up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu was\r\n\r\nquoting  prices of eggs and poultry. If  they  were  not\r\n\r\nincorrect prices, I would not have taken up the time  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly. He mentioned that the price of an egg  is\r\n\r\nnow  6  cents as compared with about 10 or 11  cents  in\r\n\r\n1948/49.  I  have  here, Sir, ex-farm  egg  and  poultry\r\n\r\nprices  compiled by the Department of Primary Production\r\n\r\ndated  9th June, 1963. There are two prices of eggs  ex-farm,  one  for small eggs and one for large  eggs.  For\r\n\r\nsmall  eggs it was 7\u00bd cents on 8th June, 1963. For large\r\n\r\neggs  it  was 8\u00bd cents 19th June, 1963. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nJalan  Kayu mentioned just now that the price is only  6\r\n\r\ncents. What was his intention in saying those things? We\r\n\r\nhave  officers who go round the farms all over Singapore\r\n\r\nisland. The Member for Jalan Kayu has a farm of his own.\r\n\r\nHe rears ducks, poultry and pigs, but he comes into this\r\n\r\nAssembly  and deliberately gives false information  with\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of  saying that the Government is  not  doing\r\n\r\nanything  for  the people of Singapore.  He  quotes  the\r\n\r\nprices  of poultry as 80 cents or 90 cents per katty.  I\r\n\r\nhave  got  here official figures. There are two  figures\r\n\r\nfor  poultry  - cockerel per katty on 8th June, 95  cents;\r\n\r\nfor pullet, $1.45 per katty.

As I have said, he comes  into\r\n\r\nthis Assembly deliberately to mislead people and to give\r\n\r\nfalse information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

He  is more concerned about the bankruptcy  of\r\n\r\nthese feed-merchants than the farmers. He mentioned that\r\n\r\nbecause these feed-merchants have to give credit to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  and because some of these farmers have  refused\r\n\r\nto pay up their money, so the retailers and whole-salers\r\n\r\nof  feed-stuff  arc going bankrupt. These  are  entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent  matters. He is more concerned with the  feed-merchants who are losing money than the farmers who  are\r\n\r\nhaving  more  produce from their farms  - as admitted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Choa Chu Kang. But the Member for Changi\r\n\r\nstood  up later on and said the exact opposite  to  what\r\n\r\nthe Member for Choa Chu Kang said.

Sir, I have  recently  been\r\n\r\nvisiting  the  rural constituencies  together  with  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  and,  in  fact,  I  have  visited  more\r\n\r\nconstituencies unofficially because it  is  my  duty  as\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development to  look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of the rural folks. [Interruption] These  are\r\n\r\nthe  Members  from the Barisan Bench who do  not  bother\r\n\r\nabout  their  constituents;  they  only  go  into  other\r\n\r\nconstituencies  to  disturb the progress  of  Government\r\n\r\nconstruction work in these constituencies. That  is  why\r\n\r\nthey do not know what is going on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last constituency that I visited with the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  was the Punggol constituency  and  this\r\n\r\nconstituency,  as  can be verified  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nPunggol, has the most number of poultry farmers. In  the\r\n\r\nPunggol  constituency, wherever you go into the  kampong\r\n\r\ntracks,  you  will  find the residents  have  their  own\r\n\r\nchicken runs. As I have said, they are now having  their\r\n\r\nchickens  kept in cages and all these cages seem  to  be\r\n\r\nexpanding more and more and occupying more space,  which\r\n\r\nsimply  means that the Barisan Members are just  talking\r\n\r\nthrough  their hats. The poultry-rearers  and  the  pig-rearers  in Singapore are enjoying a boom in production,\r\n\r\nalthough prices have fluctuated, but they have not  gone\r\n\r\nso  low,  as suggested by the Barisan Members, that  the\r\n\r\nfarmers are going bankrupt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Member for Pasir Panjang, he was half-laughing and I could not understand what he was saying.\r\n\r\nSir, if Members in this House cannot understand what  he\r\n\r\nis trying to say, how do you expect him to be able to do\r\n\r\nanything for his constituency? [Interruption] The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Choa Chu Kang, as I mentioned the other day, is out\r\n\r\nof  his mind again. He mentioned, in the same way as the\r\n\r\nMember for Changi did, that we have not done anything to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  farmers and the fishermen and  that  we  have\r\n\r\nfailed  to form a co-operative society which we  put  in\r\n\r\nour The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTasks  Ahead.  Sir, I have not intended to say  anything\r\n\r\nabout this thing because it reflects on someone in  whom\r\n\r\nI  had  faith at one time. When I took over the Ministry\r\n\r\nof National Development from the Member for Hong Lim,  I\r\n\r\nworked  out a scheme with a gentleman whom I  sent  away\r\n\r\ntwice in two years for special training to initiate this\r\n\r\nfarming co-operative work. But, unfortunately, after his\r\n\r\nsecond trip overseas when he had imbued himself with all\r\n\r\nthe  necessary knowledge and experience to come and form\r\n\r\nthis  co-operative society, he deflected from the Party.\r\n\r\nThat,  more  or less, dashed the hopes of the Government\r\n\r\nto  form the co-operative society. It was wrong  on  our\r\n\r\npart in this sense, that we had placed too much faith in\r\n\r\na  man  whom we thought would be going along with us  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  farmers of Singapore. But because  he  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  with  us,  we have suffered a  setback  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect. But, as is stated in The Tasks Ahead, this  co-operative society is to help buy feed-stuff, import feed-stuff,  and sell it cheaply to the farmers and to import\r\n\r\nfertilisers and sell these fertilisers at low prices  to\r\n\r\nhelp farmers reduce their cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite the fact that we have suffered a setback\r\n\r\nin  forming  this  rural co-operative society,  we  have\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  produce a cheap fertiliser which  has  been\r\n\r\nexperimented and used by farmers themselves and liked by\r\n\r\nthem.  This  cheap fertiliser is being sold through  the\r\n\r\nextension centres and the rural community centres to the\r\n\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards fisheries, Sir, the Member for Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang  has  again  said  that the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  has not kept its election pledges.  I  have\r\n\r\nmany times mentioned in this Assembly what the Fisheries\r\n\r\nDepartment  has done for the fishermen of Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nhave  started  two Fisheries Training  Schools  to  help\r\n\r\nchildren of fishermen in how to service their boats  and\r\n\r\nhow to go around using modern techniques of fishing.  We\r\n\r\nhave  also  a  mobile  unit attached  to  the  Fisheries\r\n\r\nDepartment  which  is  on  call to  service  fishermen's\r\n\r\nboats.  We  have  also  encouraged local  fishermen  and\r\n\r\nfishing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerchants  to go in for deep-sea fishing.  All  in  all,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Fisheries Department has done what it possibly\r\n\r\ncan to help the fishing industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I come back to the Member for Changi. He has\r\n\r\nmentioned just now about Toa Payoh farmers being  forced\r\n\r\nout  of  the  area by the Government, whether  they  are\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  their livelihood. Sir,  I  have  mentioned\r\n\r\nbefore in this Assembly the scheme in Toa Payoh and what\r\n\r\nwe  are  doing  to help the settlers move  out  of  that\r\n\r\nplace.  Sir, out of 184 families who are living  in  the\r\n\r\nPhase  1  project of this Toa Payoh Scheme, 125 families\r\n\r\nhave already moved out. To cater for the different needs\r\n\r\nof  these families, flats, house lots, farm lots,  basic\r\n\r\nterrace  houses and shops have been offered and accepted\r\n\r\nby  these  people. Acceptance of such offers means  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  continue to have a livelihood of their  own,\r\n\r\nand   in  many  cases  it  will  improve  their  present\r\n\r\nconditions.  People  have  been  offered  basic  terrace\r\n\r\nhouses  from  which they can carry on with  their  small\r\n\r\ncottage  industry. Others have moved into farm lots  and\r\n\r\nhouse lots whereby they can carry on with their farming.\r\n\r\nIndustrial resettlement cases will be considered for the\r\n\r\nKallang  industrial site. Compensation rates  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen well received by settlers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we have not been able to move these\r\n\r\npeople  and carry on with this Toa Payoh Scheme for  two\r\n\r\nyears  is because of agitation from the Country People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  and the Barisan boys. But as I  have  said,\r\n\r\nSir,  those  farmers from the Toa Payoh  area  who  have\r\n\r\nmoved  out have moved out to a place which is acceptable\r\n\r\nto them, and unless they are good offers, they would not\r\n\r\nhave accepted them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 20 be reduced by\r\n\r\n$10 in respect of item (3)  of subhead 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item concerns Political Secretary.

After some time, it was found  that\r\n\r\nthe work carried out by these temporary Rural Organisers\r\n\r\nwas  essential,  so it was decided this work  should  be\r\n\r\nexpanded  and  the  temporary posts of Rural  Organisers\r\n\r\nshould be made permanent so that the holders could carry\r\n\r\nout their work more effectively and efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 24 permanent posts of Assistant Primary Production\r\n\r\nOfficers  (Rural Development) were created in  order  to\r\n\r\nbring  them  in  line  with the ten  existing  Assistant\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production Officers (Rural Development)  posts.\r\n\r\nThese  24  new posts were advertised in the English  and\r\n\r\nvernacular  papers  by application. Out  of  nearly  395\r\n\r\napplicants, the Public Service Commission selected 24 to\r\n\r\nfill the posts. As it is the policy of the Government to\r\n\r\nprovide better and more efficient services, the work  of\r\n\r\nthese  Assistant  Primary Production Officers  has  also\r\n\r\nbeen increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are now posted in the various rural districts of\r\n\r\nSingapore   to   investigate   farmers'   problems   and\r\n\r\ncomplaints,  to  carry out agricultural surveys  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide  primary  production services such  as  sale  of\r\n\r\nfertilisers,   tractor  service,  poultry   inoculations\r\n\r\nthrough the rural community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was\r\n\r\nsurprised  that  it took the Government  four  years  to\r\n\r\nrealise the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportance  of the primary production of the State.

Since\r\n\r\nnew  appointments have been made, why is  it  that  five\r\n\r\nholders of the original posts were dismissed from  their\r\n\r\nposts?  As far as I know, these five dismissed employees\r\n\r\nstarted  work in 1959. They were living in the  district\r\n\r\nof Punggol. Their work was in the region of Tampines and\r\n\r\nPunggol and the farmers who had been served by them were\r\n\r\nvery  happy and satisfied with their services. So  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know for what reason they have been dismissed.  Can\r\n\r\nthe Minister enlighten us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> First, I must correct the Member for\r\n\r\nPunggol. These posts that we are talking about  are  for\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Officers (Rural Development) and they\r\n\r\nare  not part-time inoculators whom he meant. The  part-time inoculators come under the temporary posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come back to the Member for Havelock. What I\r\n\r\nhave  said  just  now. Sir, is that when  we  came  into\r\n\r\noffice,  we  knew  the  importance  of  having  services\r\n\r\nsupplied  to the rural areas, so we created 24 posts  at\r\n\r\nthat  time.  Last  year  we  changed  these  posts  into\r\n\r\npermanent posts. It does not mean that when these  posts\r\n\r\nwere temporary the people were not doing their work. But\r\n\r\nhe  is  saying it took us four years to realise that  we\r\n\r\nhave to have these posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the men to fill these 24 posts, 22 of these\r\n\r\n24 posts are filled by new applicants and two of the old\r\n\r\nRural  Organisers were selected to fill  the  other  two\r\n\r\nposts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the\r\n\r\nexplanation given by the Minister just now was that  the\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposts  were  temporary until this year  when  they  were\r\n\r\nchanged  to permanent.

Those five whose  services\r\n\r\nwere terminated were part-Time inoculators. They were in\r\n\r\ntemporary  posts  which are different  from  these.  The\r\n\r\nposts  of  Assistant Primary Production Officers  (Rural\r\n\r\nDevelopment)  are  Grade III-24.

Is the Minister for National Development aware that these actions of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  are to show that it is  his  merits?  I\r\n\r\nshould  say that it is not his merits. All these  things\r\n\r\nshould  have been carried out by the Government, because\r\n\r\nthe people are paying taxes. The Government levies taxes\r\n\r\non  them, and it has the duty to carry out all this kind\r\n\r\nof  construction  work, to build roads  and  to  install\r\n\r\nstreet lights where they are lacking. Sewerage should be\r\n\r\nlooked after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be repaired whenever it is necessary to do\r\n\r\nso. Whenever the Prime Minister goes to the rural areas,\r\n\r\nhe  will promise the people that the Government will  do\r\n\r\nthis  and  that for them in order to carry out political\r\n\r\npropaganda.  That  is  why  I would  like  the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned to pay attention to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. In many outlying rural areas,\r\n\r\nin   the  Sembawang  constituency,  the  Government   is\r\n\r\ninstalling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany street lights and metalling the roads, whereas  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is not going to in the other constituencies.\r\n\r\nDoes  it  mean  that  this is  a  way  to  do  political\r\n\r\npropaganda,  to  prepare  the way  for  the  future  by-election  in that constituency? Is it to make  political\r\n\r\ncapital for that event?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, although the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has explained the objects of  his  rural\r\n\r\nvisits,  the Member for Serangoon Gardens still  insists\r\n\r\non  twisting those objects The development of the  rural\r\n\r\nareas  with  regard  to roads, lighting,  drains,  stand\r\n\r\npipes,  has  been going on for the last four years.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  goes  to  the rural  constituencies  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  further the needs of such  people.  But  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of supplying all these amenities in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas has been going on for four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member brought up the subject of the\r\n\r\nSembawang constituency. I do not think he has been  down\r\n\r\nthere. I do not think he knows the conditions that  have\r\n\r\nexisted  since June 1959. For his information, the  late\r\n\r\nAssemblyman for that constituency did a lot of  work  in\r\n\r\nthat constituency for his constituents. The constituents\r\n\r\nof  Sembawang knew very well, much more than the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon Gardens knows, that when the  late  Inche\r\n\r\nAhmad was alive, he was looking after their welfare very\r\n\r\nwell.  He  did it very much better than the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSerangoon   Gardens  who  has  not   appeared   in   his\r\n\r\nconstituency for over a year. I say this, Sir, because I\r\n\r\nhave been down to his constituency lately to see to  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  his  constituents.

The Public Works Department did not carry out the work of maintenance and repair. Only when the Prime Minister was about to visit the rural areas did they\r\n\r\nissue  the so-called development projects, in  which  it\r\n\r\nwas  announced that various works and projects would  be\r\n\r\ncarried out. All this is the normal round of work to  be\r\n\r\ndone  by  the Public Works Department, but the villagers\r\n\r\nhave  to  wait  until the Prime Minister  comes  to  the\r\n\r\nconstituency  before  they  can  get  all  these  normal\r\n\r\nservices   which  they  deserve;  whereas  the  projects\r\n\r\nannounced by the Prime Minister when he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvisited the rural areas were past projects, and not new\r\n\r\nones.
