The proposal does not make any fundamental change to the system of 1-man 1-vote. When the discussions are concluded and if legislation is decided on, the Member will see that no referendum is required under the Constitution. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Supplementary question, Sir. I believe at the last general elections the PAP did not have this amendment to the Constitution to make provisions for the election of team MPs as one of their platforms. So they have no mandate to amend the Constitution. In fact, when this law to elect team MPs comes about, it will deprive voters in the constituencies of their constitutional right to elect a candidate of their own choice. Would you not agree with me on that? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir is wrong. The PAP has a mandate to amend the Constitution except for Part III of the Constitution, because it has two-thirds, or more than two-thirds, of the number of representatives in Parliament. The only situation when we need to go for a referendum is clearly spelt out in the Constitution, and that is under Part III, Protection of the Sovereignty of the Republic of Singapore. That section in the Constitution spells out clearly that a referendum is required \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> where it is proposed to surrender or transfer, wholly or in part, the sovereignty of the Republic of Singapore as an independent nation; or where it is proposed to relinquish control over the SAF or the Police Force. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst the concept of team MPs was not on our election platform in the last elections, it is not of the same magnitude that requires a referendum, even though an amendment to the Constitution is required. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think the First Deputy Prime Minister has answered my question. I think the key point is that once this provision is --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, do ask your supplementary question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I know. But he has not answered my question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> But you are going on to something else. Do ask your supplementary question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I want him to answer the point on whether, when this provision comes into being, a voter who is in a constituency for group MPs will be deprived of his right to elect a candidate of his own choice. As far as we know, it has been told to us that when this comes into being, true, you have got a 1-man 1-vote, but all the votes will be put into a common bin, is it not correct? Therefore, you cannot elect your candidate of your own choice. You are depriving a very fundamental right of a citizen. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Potong Pasir has not understood my answer. As I explained just now, this question was premature. I was answering his point on the need for a referendum on the concept of team MPs. I do not think we should stray into a debate on the concept of team MPs because discussions are still underway amongst PAP MPs, amongst ourselves and members of the public, and no legislation has been put forward to this House yet for a debate. His point of view can be argued in this House when legislation is presented to this House. But for today, I have answered his question on the need of a referendum on this particular concept. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> There are two supplementary questions. This is of national interest. You say discussions are going on. Will you include the Opposition in your discussions? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is nothing to prevent the Opposition MP from presenting his views while discussion is underway outside Parliament. And, of course, when discussion takes place in Parliament, we expect the Opposition MP to contribute his views on this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am going to ask the other supplementary question. You say it is true that you have the legal right not to hold a referendum. But do you not think the moral right is just as important? When you go for elections, I think the credibility should be tested. You have not told the electorate that you are going to amend the Constitution and half-way through the term you start amending and tinkering with the Constitution. Do you not think that is not really telling the electorate the truth of what you are going to do when you have another term of office? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a referendum is a very costly affair to hold and we should not just hold a referendum on any matter. Where an issue impinges significantly on the life of Singaporeans and on the future of the nation, then perhaps we should go for a referendum. But this is not an issue of such magnitude. It should be clear to Members of this House that when legislation of such a grave magnitude is presented, one has got to go to referendum. As I explained earlier, it will be clear to this House when we present the legislation that the proposed amendment would not in any way affect the right of members of the public or the electors to choose the MPs they want. There is no fundamental change to the system of Parliamentary elections. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this point is important. He says there is no fundamental change. I say there is. Can he please clarify? This is important to the people of Singapore because they will belosing their right to choose a representative. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam. Order. Would you please ask your supplementary question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> As regards the costs, I think we have covered this ground before.

Chandra Das</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs what were the main achievements of the 20th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting that was held in Singapore in June 1987, particularly with reference to economic relations within ASEAN and dialogue partners. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are satisfied with the outcome of the 20th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting and the Post-Ministerial Conference hosted by Singapore last month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN Foreign Ministers reviewed the preparations for the ASEAN Summit in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> December. In particular, they laid the groundwork for agreement on proposals to advance ASEAN economic cooperation. In July, the ASEAN Economic Ministers met in Singapore and agreed on several major recommendations on economic cooperation for the Summit. These recommendations would significantly improve the ASEAN Preferential Trading Arrangements and the ASEAN Industrial Joint Venture Scheme. The recommendations are practical, achievable, and will create important new linkages among the ASEAN countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Post-Ministerial meeting with dialogue countries, progress was made in eliciting Japanese support for ASEAN economic cooperation. The ASEAN countries welcomed a Japanese proposal for the establishment of an ASEAN Development Fund which can finance joint ventures among ASEAN entrepreneurs as well as between ASEAN and Japanese entrepreneurs. Senior officials from both sides will be meeting to discuss the details of the Fund. The Fund will stimulate the flow of investments to the ASEAN countries and increase industrial cooperation among the ASEAN private sectors. The ASEAN Ministers also suggested to the Japanese Foreign Minister measures to make the Japanese domestic market more accessible to ASEAN exports. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meeting with the US Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, it was agreed that senior officials from the US and ASEAN would begin work to arrive at a consensus on the ASEAN-US Initiative. The ASEAN-US Initiative would provide an economic arrangement to protect and advance ASEAN's economic interests with the United States. It could be an umbrella under which each ASEAN country could negotiate more specific agreements with the US. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the practice in the last three years for the 11 ASEAN and dialogue Foreign Ministers from the Pacific region to hold a session for consultations on developments in the Pacific region. We believe that ASEAN should not be inward-looking and must pay more attention to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the economic dynamism and rapid political and strategic changes which are taking place in the Pacific region. The discussion among the 11 Foreign Ministers is a unique forum at a high political level. This forum will assume more significance in the years ahead as economic and political trends in the Pacific increasingly affect ASEAN and Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, Singapore hosted a significant and substantive meeting. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>POLITICAL SOLUTION FOR CAMBODIA</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Differences among ASEAN countries)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S.

Chandra Das</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (a) whether he will comment on a Vietnamese statement that \"there are profound differences among the ASEAN countries\" on a political solution for Cambodia; and (b) what new initiatives will ASEAN embark upon to bring about a solution to the Cambodian problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member is referring to what was said by the Vietnamese Communist Party newspaper Nhan Dan on 21st June 1987. It is an old ploy of the Vietnamese to create the impression that ASEAN is not united in the rejection of Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia. The Vietnamese have also for some time been trying to play the divide and rule game among the ASEAN countries. They have not been successful. All the ASEAN countries are firmly agreed that the Vietnamese forces must be withdrawn from Cambodia. They are all prepared to respond to any positive signs from Vietnam to arrive at a political solution. They are also just as determined to expose any insincere manoeuvring. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the second part of the question, the main elements for a political solution to the Cambodian problem are already in circulation among the interested parties. Some of these elements, such as phased withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, Cambodian national reconciliation, need for peace-keeping forces and Cambodian self- determination, were discussed between the ASEAN Foreign Ministers and the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General, Mr Rafeeuddin Ahmed, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in Singapore last month. They do not constitute a new initiative but form part of a patient and steady diplomatic process in which ASEAN has taken a very active role. We shall see what response Mr Rafeeuddin Ahmed gets from Hanoi before talking about the next step. The ASEAN Foreign Ministers have asked Indonesian Foreign Minister, Dr Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, to meet Prince Sihanouk in Pyongyang. He has already done this and Dr Mochtar is now in Vietnam. Vietnam will soon realize that it must talk serious business and stop playing games. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MARXIST CONSPIRACY</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Protest against criticisms in Malaysia of arrests)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether he will ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a protest with the Malaysian Government over statements made by various groups in Malaysia criticising the arrests under the Internal Security Act of persons involved in the Marxist conspiracy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, a protest can only be lodged with a foreign government over actions attributable to that government. In the case of the arrests under the ISA, the question of protest does not arise because the Malaysian Government on its part has not done anything which amounts to interference in our internal affairs. On the contrary, the Malaysian Prime Minister and their Foreign Minister have publicly stated that the Malaysian Government could not interfere in the matter as it was strictly a Singapore affair. This is consistent with the practice which both Governments have always adopted of not interfering with each other's actions to deal with internal security problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true, however, that a number of Malaysian organizations have protested against the arrests. They have demanded that the detainees be released unconditionally, immediately, or be charged in court. Some have alleged that those arrested did not pose a threat to the security of Singapore and that our security action was a move to suppress political \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> opponents. Some have even called for the abolition of the ISA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that hon. Members would have noticed some strange and interesting aspects of these protests. First, these arrests are not the first time that we have acted under the Internal Security Act. Yet, none of these organizations protested before. It is only when we unmasked a Marxist conspiracy of English-educated graduates that they felt compelled to protest, although it has got nothing whatsoever to do with them. It is more than likely that the FUEMSSO Singapore members had worked together with their Malaysian counterparts whilst they were in Britain. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, except for one organization, they did not protest when we announced at about the same time the arrests of another group of four Singaporeans who were members of a silat group spreading rumours and actively making preparations for racial clashes. Why? None of the organizations ventured to explain this double standard. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, these organizations claim to have a principled stand against the ISA. Yet, while they loudly protested against the arrests in Singapore, there was a deafening silence on their part when subversive elements were arrested in their own country under their ISA in May 1987. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, they conveniently ignored the fact that the Internal Security Act of Singapore is based on the Malaysian Internal Security Act. And unlike organizations in the West, these organizations cannot claim ignorance of the security threats from communists, racial and religious extremists which have led to the ISA remaining in the statute books of both Malaysia and Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is obvious that these organizations have double standards and have some ulterior motive in making Singapore as their whipping boy. And some have axes to grind. For they cannot believe that their protests can bring about results in Singapore. I must leave Members to form their own conclusions as to why is it that it is only our exposure and disruption of the Marxist conspiracy of English-educated \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> graduates, including UK-returned students, that caused these organizations to express righteous indignation, while they remain disinterested over others whom we have arrested under the ISA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government is accountable to the people of Singapore. The more foreign groups or individuals interfere, the more closely we examine their interests and when these protests come from those against Singapore's interests, the more systematically we proceed to protect our own interests, namely, the stability, security and prosperity of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HDB RENTAL TENANTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Execution of legal documents and collection of keys)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. \n  <b>Dr Ho Tat Kin</b> asked the Minister for National Development if the Housing and Development Board will consider changing the current procedure of rental tenants having to execute the legal documents at the Board's head office and to collect the keys at the area office to allowing rental tenants to execute the legal documents and collect the keys at the same time at the area office. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S.

There are also facilities at the Head Office to enable tenants to open a PUB account, thus avoiding a separate trip to the PUB headquarters to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a very brief period between November 1986 and February 1987, during the start of the Rental Block Relocation Exercise, rental tenants affected had to make two trips, one to the Head Office to execute the legal documents, while the flats were in the hands of contractors doing minor repairs. When the repairs and touching up were completed, tenants had to go to the Area Office to collect the keys. This practice has since been discontinued. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HDB RENTAL FLATS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Policy and particulars)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. \n  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what is the number of (i) Housing and Development Board flats available for rental, (ii) rental flats already occupied and (iii) applicants for rental flats, as at the latest convenient date; and (b) what is the current policy with regard to rental flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as at 31st May 1987, there were 38,263 vacant rental flats. However, only 8,237 flats were available for rental. The other 30,026 flats were in blocks earmarked for demolition. 84,551 rental flats are presently occupied. As at 31st May 1987, there were 2,978 public applicants for rental flats. Of these, 1,100 have been offered flats which they have not taken up. The rest are being allocated flats in accordance with their registration priority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's policy is to encourage the public to buy rather than rent flats. There are various special incentive schemes to help existing rental tenants as well as those on the rental waiting list to purchase Home Ownership flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far about 10,000 rental tenants have applied to purchase HDB flats. The HDB, however, recognizes that there will be a small group of low income citizens who cannot afford to buy Home Ownership flats.

They cannot be burnt in the open. Open burning is an offence under the Clean Air Act of 1971. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When incinerated under controlled conditions at our incineration plants, the only end-products are carbon dioxide and water. There is no pollution to the environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ang Kok Peng (Buona Vista):</b> Sir, I have two supplementary questions for the Senior Parliamentary Secretary. First, has the Ministry conducted any survey to find out whether the disposable ware used by food hawkers and vendors in Singapore are of a quality that meets the safety specifications adopted by advanced countries such as the USA or UK? Secondly, some food hawkers are reusing these disposable wares which are not meant to be washed and reused. Does the Ministry contemplate taking any action against them? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the answer to the first question is yes. Among the various standards that we have looked at, two are worth mentioning. One is the United States Food and Drug Administration and the other is the FAO/WHO Expert Committee Standards. These bodies set standards which determine whether a disposable crockery made of expandable polystyrene is or is not food grade. Extensive tests are carried out by us in the Environment, and I am pleased to inform the Member that so far disposable crockery used by hawkers meet the standards of these two food authorities. They are therefore very safe for use. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other question of reusing disposable crockery, my Ministry views this practice very seriously. Any stallholder or any hawker who is caught reusing disposable crockery will be appropriately brought to task. Disposable crockery by its very nature means that it must be disposed of. It cannot be reused. There is no possibility, in fact, of disposable crockery being washed and reused because they are very flimsy. In fact, when we first introduced disposable crockery in hawker \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> centres, there was already talk that hawkers were likely to reuse the disposable crockery. So from the very start, we were already very careful in our checks of hawker centres to make sure that this is not really the case. Here again, I would like to assure the Member for Buona Vista and the public that we have so far not caught or found any hawker reusing disposable crockery. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXTENSION OF PARF FOR PRIVATE MOTOR CARS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. \n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Information whether he will extend the period of eligibility for Preferential Additional Registration Fee in respect of privately owned motor-cars from 10 years to 15 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Minister for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Communications and Information (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the PARF scheme was introduced in 1975 as an incentive to encourage motorists to scrap their cars before they are 10 years old. The objective is to reduce the number of old cars so that there will be fewer breakdowns on our roads and greater safety for our users. Traffic congestion during peak hours because of such breakdowns will also be minimized. The measure would also cut down on noise and air pollution on our roads. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy has proved effective. Raising the 10-year limit would be counter productive. It would mean encouraging more old vehicles to be on the road, with greater likelihood of breakdowns, thus, leading to greater traffic congestions and inconvenience to all road users. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to point out once again that the PARF scheme is an incentive to motorists to scrap their cars before they become unroadworthy. There is no compulsion. Car owners are free to choose when to scrap their cars. Those who find it economical to maintain their cars at a high level beyond the 10 years are free to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Isn't the continuation of this policy a waste on our country's resources?

Between 1982 and 1986, the failure rate for motor cars fluctuated between 70% and 80%. As for motor lorries, the failure rate was between 60% and 70%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many candidates fail the driving test because they are inadequately prepared when they appear for their tests. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Minister of State willing to waive the compulsory taking of a test after they have successfully passed their traffic code? I believe that a person has to take the traffic code and there is a minimum period in which he has to take his driving test. Perhaps that is the cause of the high rate of failure. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I think the Member for Potong Pasir is quite confused.

There is the basic driving theory test and there is a final driving theory test before the practical test. A candidate for the practical test must first pass the final driving theory test. After having passed the final driving theory test, he has to sit for the practical test within a period of one year. I believe this is the compulsory period that he is referring to. Why one year? I think a person who has learnt the theory of driving should as soon as possible put that theory to good use and he should therefore sit for the driving test. If you allow too long a period to elapse, then all that he has learnt in the theories of driving could be forgotten and he could then become a danger to other road users if he is allowed on the road. The question here, Sir, is, do we want to make our roads safer? Do we want to improve the quality of our drivers? If so, I think the present system is a step in that direction. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HDB RELOCATION OF RENTAL FLATS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Effects on neighbourhood shop-houses)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S.

There are about 3,000 shops in these estates affected by the relocation exercise. Of these, about 1,300 shops will also be removed as they are located in rental blocks which are due for demolition. Under the Phase 1A relocation exercise from 1986 to 1988, 150 shop tenants are to be relocated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the reduction of shops in the vicinity, the shop to flat ratios before and after the relocation exercise will still be comparable to what is found in other HDB estates. It should improve, of course, when neighbourhoods are developed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the remaining shop tenants feel that they are paying rents higher than the prevailing market rates, they may tender for shops in other estates or give up their shops and re-tender for their existing shops. They will, of course, have to make their own business calculations as to what they want to do. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Bo Wen):</b> Sir, what immediate steps would be taken for existing shops that are in the neighbourhood to liven their social and economic activity? Another supplementary question is, would a temporary rental rebate be considered until the estate is rebuilt and its economic activity reactivated? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, can I take the second part of the question on temporary rebate first? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many factors that affect the business of shops. People move in, people move out; houses are knocked down, new flats are built. I do not think the Government should intervene in these market factors. It is for each shopkeeper to make up his mind whether the location that he chose continues to be a good location. If, in his opinion, the location is not a good location any more, then he should make up his mind to move somewhere else or give up his shop and re-tender for the same shop. No temporary rebate will be given. Once the Government or HDB begins to give temporary rebates because business in the shops is affected by various factors, there is no end to the kind of factors that would be presented to the Government or to the HDB in requesting for rebates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the shops affected are concerned, those who are directly affected, in other words, in blocks which are due for clearance, will be offered alternative shops. Those in the vicinity who are not affected by the relocation exercise but who may be indirectly affected because people in the neighbouring blocks have moved out, have to make their own business calculations, as I have mentioned just now. There is no scheme at the present moment to give them any special assistance. The HDB will try as much as possible to redevelop the areas vacated so that life is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> re-introduced, but in the period that the blocks are cleared, demolished, new flats are built, the shopkeepers have to make their own business calculations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, in view of what the Hon. Minister has just stated, will he consider the question of the Housing Board delaying the projected increase in rental for the next two years? I am sure he is aware that the Housing Board has projected annual increases for the past three years, and this has been suspended due to economic recession. Will he consider, as a measure to help these shopkeepers, suspending the increase in rentals projected for next year? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the increases, if any, are not determined by any pre-determined rental increase. It is determined by market factors. If shops are knocked down and less people live in the area, obviously the market rental rate for that area will be less. And if the prevailing market rate is about the same as what they are paying now, then there will be no increase. But if the prevailing market rate, in spite of blocks being knocked down is higher, then of course the rentals will be increased. So the HDB is not working on any pre-set increases. The increases are determined by market rates. If the market rates have gone up and those who are paying current rates are, in fact, paying lower than the market rates, then there will be increases. But if the market rates have not gone up, there will be no increases. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that the Foreign Minister has taken over the portfolio recently, he may not be aware that the increase in rentals was targeted for 1st September each year for the next three years. But these increases were suspended during the past two years, and the next increase is due next year, 1st September. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> I may have taken office lately, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, but I was also in this House, so I know what was discussed. The reason why the increases were phased out was that the market rate was so much higher than what people were paying that it was felt that it would be unreasonable to have an increase suddenly from the rates that they were \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> paying to the prevailing market rates. At the time that this scheme was introduced to increase the rates, the gap was so big that it was projected that it would be closed over a number of years and every September there was to be an increase to bring it closer to the prevailing market rate. If the prevailing market rate is still where it was determined sometime ago, then of course the increases have to proceed. But if the prevailing market rate has come down from what we determined sometime ago, then there will be no increase. Although at that time there was supposed to be a schedule of increases every September, every time an increase is to be made we look again at the market rates and if there is a difference, of course there will be an increase. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Bo Wen):</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that some of these factors are beyond the control of the shopkeepers?

It has been growing since then from 24 reported cases in 1980 to 1005 in 1985, and 997 cases in 1986. In the first five months of 1987, some 535 inhalant abusers were detected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of first-timers has also been increasing. A study conducted on the inhalant abusers showed that 75.3% were school dropouts and 84.1% were below 20 years old. The largest group was the 15 to 19 years old which accounted for 62.9% of the inhalant abusers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inhalant abuse is a destructive habit. A frequent abuser will suffer mental and physical impairment. Since 1980, there have been 20 deaths related to inhalant abuse. The problem therefore has to be tackled. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Narcotics Bureau is the national agency coordinating measures to tackle the inhalant abuse problem. An Inter-Ministry Committee is actively monitoring the situation. I have previously informed Members in this House of the various measures recommended by this Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New legislation to tackle the problem will be introduced at today's sitting. The proposed legislation will have the following features: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It will be an offence to sell or supply volatile inhalants to inhalant abusers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Suspected inhalant abusers will be subjected to blood tests to confirm their condition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) First-time inhalant abusers will be placed under supervision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Inhalant abusers who breach the supervision order will be subjected to compulsory treatment and rehabilitation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Approved centres to be set up with the sole purpose of treating and rehabilitating recalcitrant inhalant abusers. This will be resorted to only when all other efforts to help the abusers fail. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Inhalant abusers admitted for treatment and rehabilitation in an approved centre will be detained for not more than six months and, for subsequent periods, of not more than three months at any one time, subject to a maximum period of one year's detention. They will be placed under supervision after their discharge from the approved centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Measures to discourage shopkeepers from selling volatile inhalants to youngsters will also be introduced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, steps are being taken to provide facilities for the control of the inhalant abuse problem. In the meantime, measures are being taken by the respective agencies, including preventive education, counselling and informal supervision.

The Board now intends to extend this programme to enable its shop tenants to own their own shop premises. Presently HDB manages some 14,000 shops spread over all its estates. The HDB will sell its shops gradually over a long period of time. The sale of shops will assure security of tenure to businesses and also be a form of investment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed sale of shops will be done in a manner that will not dampen the property market. The Government is aware of the present glut in this market and will implement the scheme in stages. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Numbers sold will be based on market studies to ensure that recovery in the property market is not adversely affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will begin with the sale of 100 new shops at the end of 1987. This will be done to gauge the response of the market. Thereafter depending on the response, new shops which are scheduled for completion throughout 1988 will be put up for sale as and when they are completed. For the first three years the sale of new and vacant shops will be confined to Singapore citizens and to companies and partnerships in which the majority ownership belongs to the citizens. Depending upon market reaction the sale of existing shops to sitting tenants will take place in a later phase. For sitting tenants the restriction on citizenship will not apply. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owners of HDB shops, which they purchase under this new scheme, will be allowed to sublet, or resell their shops freely as in the private sector. Resale is subject to the citizenship restriction for the first three years. Change of use and trade will be allowed subject to the normal environmental and development regulations. This will bring HDB's shops policy closer to market practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile existing shops in HDB estates will have their monthly tenancies converted into fixed periods of one to three years, depending on the circumstances and types of shops. This is to give tenants a more assured term of tenancy within which they can make their business planning and other investment decisions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its policy to increase the residents to shops ratio in HDB estates, the HDB will be building proportionately fewer shops in its new estates. This will increase the viability of these shops. In view of this change, the present practice of allocating shops on priority to resettlement cases will cease immediately. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of shophouses affected by public clearance scheme will be as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Anyone interested in renting shops, including resettlement cases, will have to tender for them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Shopkeepers in permanent rent-controlled premises affected by resettlement will be given cash grants as provided under the existing policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Shopkeepers in temporary premises affected by resettlement, who were previously not entitled to any cash grant, will now be given a cash grant of $26,000 per premises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these cases, there will be no alternative option to request for allocation of a shop. They will have to tender with the public if they are interested. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist resettlement shopkeepers who want alternative premises to continue their businesses, the Government has decided to give them a preferential margin when tendering for HDB shops. The margin will be 10% for sole occupiers and 5% each for the tenants. This preferential margin is given in addition to the cash grants which I have mentioned earlier. Farmers who are not shopkeepers will not be entitled to such a preferential margin. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, since my Question No. 15 has prompted the Hon. Minister to make a Ministerial statement, it gives me an opportunity to ask him more questions as a result, and I hope he will take them down. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Can the Hon. Minister indicate where these 100 shops will be located? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Will HDB provide loans to the successful tenderers for the shops? If not, who will provide the financing of such purchases? How long will the leases be then? Can lessees of HDB shops purchase their shops? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) As regards rental shops, will there be a review of the terms governing their tenancies upon renewal? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) As regards resettlement cases, what is the rationale for allowing those shops affected by clearance schemes to lose their priority of shop allocation? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) No doubt the Minister has just now mentioned, but is he of the view that these shopkeepers affected by clearance schemes are unable to survive in new \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> environment and to compete with the others? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Would HDB consider allocating a shop if a shopkeeper affected by such clearance scheme elects or chooses to forgo the compensation, as mentioned by him? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, I just want to ask the Minister two questions. Would priority be given to existing tenants if the shophouses are up for sale? Second question is: can CPF be used to finance the purchase? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, I have two questions for the Minister. As regards the new shops to be sold at the end of 1987, must they be used for owner- occupation, which means that the purchasers must use them for their own business? Or can they freely lease them to others? Secondly, will the new policy of $26,000 compensation for shopkeepers be applied to those already resettled, ie, already moved out but are presently on the waiting list for the allocation of shophouses? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine H.H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine H.H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have a couple of questions. Firstly, would the Hon. Minister consider a petition by existing tenants of HDB shophouses to purchase shops from the Housing Board? Secondly, why is he confining the sale of new shops to Singapore citizens, if he is really concerned about the property market? One would have thought that by allowing non-citizens to compete in buying the new shops, this would help to buoy up the property market. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first of all, I must say that the Member for Punggol, although he is very influential, did not prompt this change in policy. It just happens to be a coincidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first question he asked was, where will the shops be, ie the 100 shops that will be sold in the first instance by the end of this year? These shops are located in the various town centres in Hougang, Serangoon Town Centre, Bishan Neighbourood II Centre, and the Bukit Timah \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> estate. They are spread over these areas. He then asked: will the HDB provide loans? The answer is no. The tenderers for these shops must make their own arrangements with banks, finance companies or others, to finance the purchase of these shops. I do not think under current circumstances they should have any difficulties because I think the financial system as a whole has more than sufficient liquidity to finance these shops. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question: how long will the leases be? They will be for 99 years. He then asked whether HDB flat owners can purchase shops. The answer is yes. They can purchase, just as they are allowed at present to purchase commercial properties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question was in relation to those who are renting shops, whose monthly tenancies will now be changed to fixed term tenancies for one, two or three years, as I mentioned. And the Member asked what would be the terms upon renewal. The practice will be the same as in the private sector. When a fixed term expires, renewal will be negotiated on current market terms. If the current market rentals have gone up, of course, the rentals will go up. If the current market rentals have gone down, then rentals will go down. So upon the expiry of the fixed term, renewal will be upon prevailing terms at the time of renewal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question was: what is the reason or the rationale for not allowing resettlement cases to have alternative shops? I have already explained this. HDB is building less shops in the new housing estates because in the old housing estates where there are too many shops, this makes not all of them viable. In some areas as and when shops are vacated, HDB is not letting out vacated shops but converting them into other uses so that the ratio of shops to residents or dwellings will improve and the shops will become more viable. With less shops, there will not be enough shops to offer to resettlement cases. And if resettlement cases are given alternative shops, then almost all the new shops in the new Housing Board areas will be taken up by resettlement cases. This would mean a very poor mix of shops and limited variety of services for the residents \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in these new areas because most resettlement cases are sundry shops. You cannot have a Housing Board neighbourhood comprising only sundry shops. We need a variety of services. So in view of the smaller number of shops available, this policy of not offering alternative shops was decided. I must say that many of these new policies pertaining to resettlement are the result of recommendations made by a Committee that was established by the Ministry. Many Members of Parliament who have many resettlement cases in their constituencies were members of this Committee, including the Member for Punggol and many others. They made a number of recommendations on resettlement terms and many of the recommendations were accepted. So this process of reviewing the resettlement terms has been going on for some time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we come to the conclusion that resettlement shopkeepers or resettlement cases can survive by competing with others? Well, they have to survive by competing. And I think that under the present circumstances which I have explained, it is just not possible to give them resettlement priority. As to whether the HDB will consider allocating a shop if a resettlement shopkeeper chooses to forgo his compensation, obviously the answer is no, because that is the old policy. No alternative shops will be offered. He has to take the cash compensation. And if the shopkeeper wants to tender, then he can take advantage of the 10% and 5% preferential margins that I mentioned in my statement just now. I think that covers all the questions raised by the Member for Punggol. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is whether priority be given to existing tenants. I am not very clear about this question. I think it was the Member for Chua Chu Kang who asked this question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> If a tenant's shop is up for sale, would you give him priority? Or has he got to move out first before he tenders with the others? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> We have not decided on the details of how sitting tenants' shops will be sold. As I said, this will be in a later phase of the exercise. Obviously, some \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> special consideration will have to be given to sitting tenants. Because when I said that we want to sell the shops to sitting tenants, it must mean that sitting tenants will have an advantage. So at the time when we come to selling shops to sitting tenants, the rules and procedures will be drawn up in such a way that they will have some advantage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question whether CPF funds can be used, I think, if I am not mistaken, CPF can be used to buy commercial properties as an investment. So if they fall within the existing CPF rules, certainly they can use CPF. But you might want to ask my colleague, the Minister for Labour, for more clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other questions. First, can the present purchasers lease their shops? Was that the question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, perhaps I may refresh the Minister's memory. What I asked was whether there are any conditions attached to the purchasers of the new shops, such as whether they are allowed to lease out the shops or whether the shops must be owner-occupied. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> The details will be spelt out when the HDB makes its detailed policy statement. If I remember correctly, if somebody wants to buy a shop merely as an investment, he can do so but there is a limit. I think you cannot buy more than one or two units. There is a limit to the number of units that you can buy. But if a company wants to buy 20 units to open a supermarket, because that company is operating the business, it can make a bid for 20 units. If somebody wants to merely buy a unit as an investment and not operate a business in the unit, there will be a limit on the number of units that he can buy. These details will be announced later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question whether the $26,000 will also be granted to those on the waiting list, I am afraid this is a matter of detail which I cannot answer the Member now. But if the Member can address a question to me in writing, I certainly will give him a reply. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the HDB will entertain a petition from existing shop tenants who want to buy shops, certainly we will entertain \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> petitions. And if they are very keen to buy the shops, maybe we will accelerate the programme of selling to sitting tenants. But on this, as I said, we will determine the phasing based on market demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered all the questions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Why are we confining to Singapore citizens? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Why are we confining only to Singapore citizens? I have already mentioned that we do not want to upset the market too much. At the same time, the present policy on the HDB shops is to try and give them to citizens first. As I said, after the three years, there will be no restriction. They can sell it to non-citizens. Should it be extended in the initial phases, we will have to study what the market reaction is to the initial sale before we make any changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, one last question. Does it mean that this statement takes immediate effect vis-a-vis the resettlement cases? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Yes. As I said, it would take immediate effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>12.21 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LONG-TERM CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND RATES OF CONTRIBUTION</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Statement by the Minister for Labour)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government has completed its study on the appropriate long-term rates and structure of Central Provident Fund contributions. The present contribution rate is 10% for employers and 25% for employees, making a total of 35%. After careful study, taking into consideration both social and economic factors, the Government has decided on the following rates. The target CPF total contribution rate is 40% for members below age 55, 25% for those aged 55 to 60, 15% for those aged 60 to 65 and 10% for those above 65 years old. The employer's and the employee's contribution rates will be equal. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute an Annex (Cols. 1425 - 1426) which shows the target CPF rates. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1987/19870728/19870728-HA-0491425.htm\">Annex - TARGET LONG-TERM CPF RATES (Cols. 1425 - 1426)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Copies of Annex distributed to hon. Members.] \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Projections of CPF Balances</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computations of CPF balances at ages 55 and 60 have been made for different income groups of new CPF members assuming various CPF contributions rates. These members are assumed to purchase housing commensurate with their income levels. After providing for Medisave, the end balances are computed and converted into equivalent monthly annuities to compare with the members' projected take-home pay. We can thus assess whether the end balances will be adequate for the members to live on over their average life span after retirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target CPF contribution rates will be just sufficient to provide for the three basic objectives of retirement income, housing and Medisave, if the CPF member retires at age 60. He would have a CPF balance which would be sufficient for him to draw down at the rate of about 20% to 40% of his last take-home pay. Most workers should continue to be gainfully employed to age 60 or beyond, even though they will be able to withdraw their CPF savings at age 55. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>CPF Rate for Older Employees</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government encourages employers to extend the retirement age from 55 to 60. With longer life expectancy, workers should continue to be employed as long as they can be of value to their employers. 60 is already the retirement age in the Civil Service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with long seniority-based time scales, the wages of older workers may be higher than the market values of their jobs. Simply raising the retirement age without correcting the wage structure will burden companies with higher wage costs and impair their competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To lower the cost of employing older workers, the Government will progressively reduce the total CPF contribution \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> rate beyond the age of 55 as shown in the Annex. But this by itself will not solve the problem. Wage reform must also be pursued vigorously, to shorten the wage scales and cap the salaries at the top of long scales. New, lower salary scales beyond age 55 may also need to be worked out. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers and unions should therefore begin to negotiate higher retirement ages and new wage scales for older workers in their collective agreements. The retirement age should be raised progressively to 60, except in those jobs which are unsuitable for older workers. One way to do so is to phase the adjustment over, say, five years. Thus employees who are now 50 years old and below will retire at the age of 60, those now aged 51 will retire at the age of 59, and so on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would like to see the retirement age raised on a voluntary basis, by agreement between employers and workers. It will review the situation in three to four years to decide whether any further measures should be taken. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the CPF rates beyond 55, most CPF members aged above 55 would have met their housing commitments in full and do not require as high a CPF rate as younger members. For those still servicing housing loans, it is important that they continue to be employed so that they will have the means to service their loans. They also need to accumulate further savings in their Medisave accounts to better provide for their medical expenses which are likely to increase with age and with improvements in medical science. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Special Account</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contributions to the Special Account have been suspended since April last year when the CPF contribution rate was cut by 15 percentage points. With future increases in CPF contribution, up to 4 percentage points will be channelled into the Special Account. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will help to ensure that members do not invest their entire CPF savings in property but will retain a cash reserve to provide them with at least a small income after retirement. However, some existing home-buyers have already committed to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> housing loans based on the previous 50% CPF rate. They will be permitted to draw on their Special Accounts to meet their committed loan instalments after they have exhausted their Ordinary Accounts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Account will also serve as a buffer which can be more readily adjusted in a recession as the funds are not committed for housing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Implementation</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must restore the CPF rate without hurting our international competitiveness. The restoration will be phased in over several years, in step with economic growth and increased productivity. The adjustments for older workers will also be in gradual steps. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the economy is still recovering from the recession, the CPF rate will remain unchanged this year. Next year if the economy continues to improve, the Government is likely to raise the CPF rate with effect from 1st July 1988. Employers and employees should already take this into account in their wage negotiations this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if employer's contributions are raised by 3 percentage points, and employee's contributions are reduced by 1 percentage point, the total rate will be increased by 2 percentage points for workers below age 55. Simultaneous adjustments will also be made for older workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adjustment would increase employer's wage costs by 3% and employee's take-home pay by 1%, even if basic wages remain unchanged. Both employer's and employee's contributions are part of total wage costs. The CPF rate increase must therefore be part of an agreed overall wage increase for the year, and not be added on to it. The Government will decide on the 1988 adjustments to the CPF contribution rates after the economic results for the first quarter of 1988 are known. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar adjustments in the years when the economy is performing well will gradually restore the total CPF rate for workers below age 55 to 40%, consisting of equal contributions by employers and employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Boon Heng (Kebun Baru):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister's Statement is welcomed and I think it will be generally supported by both employers and employees. It is good to know what the long-term rate of CPF contribution by both employers and employees is going to be. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few questions to ask the Minister. First, I would like to ask him to clarify how he intends to implement the CPF contribution rate beyond the age of 55. It is not quite clear to me in the Statement. Second, since the Minister has suggested that lower wage scales beyond the age of 55 may be necessary and that this should be taken into account in wage reform, is he not concerned that inclusion of this item in current wage reform negotiations may slow down the process? Third, is the Minister suggesting that, in general, wage scales should be lower for those above 55? Will there not be cases where the wage scales may, in fact, be higher beyond the age of 55? Finally, will the Government set a stronger example in employing older workers? Whilst the Minister has stated that the retirement age for workers in the public sector is 60, in fact those who were employed before 1st July 1956 have their retirement age still at 55. Would the Government consider raising the retirement age for these workers also to 60 years old? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ang Kok Peng (Bunoa Vista):</b> May I refer to the Annex provided just now?

Minister for the efforts made in introducing the long-term CPF rates of contribution. The proposed scheme is a step towards consolidating our efforts at safeguarding the interests of our people, especially the older workers. When successfully implemented, the new CPF scheme --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Encik Abbas, are you making a speech? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Abbas Abu Amin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Abbas Abu Amin:</b> I am asking a question later on, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> No. Could you ask your question now? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Abbas Abu Amin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Abbas Abu Amin:</b> I would like the Minister to clarify some of the points that I have here. (1) Based on the current collective agreement, what is the percentage of contributors in the age groups of 55-60, 60-65, and above 65 years old? These are the age groups that are directly affected by the new scheme. (2) Will the public sector take the lead in raising the retirement age from 60 to 65 years? (3) How will these proposed CPF rates affect the public sector employees who are on the pension scheme? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to ask some questions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to express my support for the Minister's suggestions about these new CPF measures. Just now the Minister announced the long-term CPF rates for workers below 55 to above 65 years old. Would the Minister let us know in greater detail the time-frame for these measures, whether it is over a period of three years or five years or ten years for the gradual implementation of the varying contribution rates. Another point is about the decreasing rate of CPF contributions for workers under 55. Will the Minister take into consideration their ability and needs for saving for old age, Medicare and public housing? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wong Kwei Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wong Kwei Cheong (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, firstly, how many collective agreements in Singapore are there, for workers with retirement ages beyond 55? Are there any such collective agreements with reducing wage scales for those above 55? If not, how will the Ministry go about encouraging in future, as the retirement ages are increased, reducing wage scales for those who are beyond 55? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I would like to ask is about the target total CPF rates announced. Are they going to be the maximum rates on a permanent basis? Or, would these target rates be changed as our economic performance improves in the years to come? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third question is, since I believe the objective of this whole exercise in restructuring the CPF long-term rates is to encourage more older workers to join the work- force so as to reduce our tight labour situation, there is also another pool of workers, part-time workers in particular, who should be considered. If you look at the Female Labour Force Participation Rate, it drops very quickly after the age of 25. This shows that many of our female workers, after marriage, do not join the workforce. May I ask the Minister whether he is willing to consider reducing the CPF contribution rates for part-time workers? If they are reduced, then factories for example, can start 4-hour shifts and engage many of these females who are not able to work on a normal 8-hour shift. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I welcome the Minister's Statement. I also commend him for the work he has done in arriving at the conclusions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have four questions here. The first refers to the 4% that is to be locked up in the Special Account. This Account is soaking up funds. How will this affect the economy in the years to come? The second question is that the rate targetted for the age group of 55-60 is going to be increased from 10% to 12.5%. Is this not contrary to our aim of encouraging employment of people above the age of 55? Should this not remain at 10%? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is, this increased CPF contribution will come mainly from future wage increases. How will this affect companies which are not in a position to give the recommended wage increases? For example, companies which are not doing well and are not, in fact, in a position to give any increase at all. The last question is this. Setting the target rate of 40% to take into account old age, housing and medical needs, does this mean that there will be no room for other uses of CPF, like education? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, these target long-term CPF rates appear to have been set to satisfy housing needs, retirement and health needs. My first question is, would the Minister supply the basis of his calculations to this House? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> In other words, what exactly are considered to be housing needs? Does he consider a 3-room flat, a 4-room flat, or is allowance being made in his calculations for upgrading of flats? And how many upgradings has he allowed in his calculations? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, has he taken into account the macro- economic considerations from the overall savings investment needs of the economy? Because there has been a concern expressed in the last couple of years that we are over- saving in relation to the investment requirements or what we can invest in our own economy. So were the macro-economic considerations taken into account? If so, could he supply the details to this House? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> A few questions for the Minister. First, a simple one. How long is long-term? Five years, 10 years, 30 years? The second question is a related question. What is the assumed or expected inflation rate over this period? Thirdly, has the Minister considered varying the contribution rates according to income levels rather than age groups or in addition to age groups? If not, is he implying that differential rates based on income level is less equitable than the differential rate based on age? Finally, how will the new rates affect (a) aggregate consumption, and (b) national savings ratio. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Philip Tan Tee Yong (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, if I am not mistaken the Minister mentioned in this House that, to release funds for education, CPF rates would have to be increased. Now with the long-term increases in mind, will CPF for education be considered? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as usual, Members have shown very keen interest in this issue and I thank them for their questions and comments. It will give me the opportunity to clarify various aspects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with the questions in the order they were raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the questions from the Member for Kebun Baru. How will the new CPF rates \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for those above age 55 be implemented? The answer is that as we adjust the rates for the younger workers, we will also adjust the rates for the older workers. So both the rates for the younger workers and the older workers will be in phases. The time scales may not be identical but the basic concept is that it is better to phase in the rates to allow the people affected time to adjust, both the employers as well as the employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question: whether this call to employers to negotiate, if necessary, lower wage scales beyond age 55 will cause delays in the wage reform process? Yes, it is true that wage reform is very important and I hope the employers will not delay unduly. With economic recovery on the way, it is important that they reform the wages as soon as possible. That obviously is top priority. But at the same time the Government is keen to raise the retirement age to 60, progressively. So it may be a good idea if we can start work straightaway and if the employers and the unions can get together to discuss this issue. It does not mean that wage scales will have to be lowered for all workers beyond age 55. There could be certain categories of workers, for example, brain services, where, in fact, the performance improves with experience and age. But there are certain other jobs, say, the manual ones, where clearly some workers may be overpaid when they are at the top of their wage scales. In those situations, I think it will not be feasible to simply insist that the employers raise the retirement age. What we have done is to lower their CPF rates to make it possible to lower the cost of employing the workers without affecting, if possible, their take-home pay. But it may not be sufficient in some cases, for example, where the wage scale is very long. There are some situations where the older employees at the top of the scale may be paid as much as three times the starting salary. So if we assume that the correct market wage may be somewhere in the middle, those at the top may, in fact, be paid 50% over their market value. The adjustments in the CPF rates may not be sufficient to correct for this factor. So it is important that both union leaders and the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> workers realize that it is in their self-interest to make the necessary adjustments, not only through the CPF rates but also, if necessary, through wage scales. Otherwise there will be no employment opportunities beyond 55. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question: I think I have already answered it. It is not necessary that this will apply in every case. We are proposing these new rates for the different age groups. The rates will apply across the board to all the workers in the same age group. The expectation is that with negotiations, adjustments and so on, we will eventually reach a new equilibrium where the rates are at those levels and hopefully the workers will also be employed up to age 60 or beyond, and the economics will sustain that kind of a situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 4: Will the Government set the example by also extending the retirement age of public sector employees who were employed before 1st July 1956? It is true that those employees who joined the Government before 1st July 1956 have a retirement age of 55. Those employed after that date form the vast majority of employees and with few exceptions, for example the uniformed services, the retirement age is now 60 for the public sector. Whether the Government will consider raising it for the other groups, I think the numbers affected are small because most of them would have retired by now. This is a question that I will pass over to the Minister for Finance because it is really in his field and it has to be looked into further. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Buona Vista pointed out a technical error in the Annex. I thank him for it. Of course, at age 55, there is this question of the birthday - whether you are just below or above 55. The first line \"below 55\" means up to but not including age 55, and the other column \"Above 55\" means 55 and above, and so on. So this is the borderline situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the Member for Pasir Panjang. He was asking for numbers affected in the different age groups. I do not have the detailed numbers on CPF contributors with me. It should be in the CPF Report but I have some figures on the number of people employed beyond age \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 55. I think the figures should be quite similar. I will supply the data to him later on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His question No. 2: Will the public sector take the lead? The public sector has, in fact, taken the lead for many years already. The retirement age is in fact 60 for almost all employees in the public sector who joined on or after 1st July 1956. That was 31 years ago. By now the majority of those who joined before that date would have retired. But it is important that Government should set the lead. I would also appeal to all the union leaders and the public in general to understand the issue and make the necessary adjustments. The retirement age is already 60 or 65 years in most developed countries. Our life expectancy has gone up. At the present moment it is about 75 or 76 years for males and 78 years for females. We are somewhat similar to the Japanese situation 15 years ago. Right now the Japanese life expectancy is about three years more. By the turn of the century, our life expectancy may well be in the 80's. So it is important that the employees should continue to work as long as they can. That is why the Government is so keen to raise the retirement age. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question was raised: What would happen to the CPF rate of pensionable officers? This is a detail which we are working out and there are various other details which will be announced in due course. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the questions from the Member for Yuhua. She asked for clarification of the time-frame for implementing the transition to the new rates. I have mentioned that if things go well, we will make our first move next year. Then we will have to observe the economic performance every year and, if conditions permit, we will make the adjustments. It is difficult to put an actual time-frame on it. It will depend on economic performance. But the intention is not to delay this unduly. I do not know, it may take five years. It depends on our economic performance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked whether we have considered the problems of those above age 55 in implementing the new rates. I think she has in mind mainly this question of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> housing loans. We have some data on this. There are about 7,200 CPF members who are above age 55 and who are still servicing their housing loans with CPF contributions. The important thing for this group of workers is that they should continue to be employed beyond age 55 because without employment there will be no pay, no CPF. So what we are trying to do is to make it feasible for them to go on working beyond 55. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have done a study of numbers affected by the new CPF rates. Of those above age 55, we reckon that not more than 500 persons will be in some difficulty, in the sense of having to dip into their pockets beyond their CPF balances. As for the other members, there are about 280,000 CPF members who are still servicing housing loans, both private and public. We estimate that perhaps 10,000 may have to supplement their loan instalments with cash. The number is actually very small as a percentage of the total number who are still servicing their housing loans and there are various schmes to assist them, for example, the HDB scheme of extended repayment, ballooning, and so on. As for private property owners, we have a bridging loan scheme. But as of now, only 17 persons have made use of the scheme. So there does not seem to be a very big problem for this group of people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this question of housing, I should elaborate a little bit. Before the CPF cut, out of the 50% CPF rate, 40 percentage points went into the Ordinary Account which could be used for housing. After the cut, out of the 35%, 29 percentage points went into the Ordinary Account. So it was reduced from 40% to 29%. With the restoration to the final 40% rate for workers below 55, 30 percentage points will go into Ordinary Account, 4 percentage points into Special Account and 6 percentage points into Medisave. For those members who have housing loan commitments, they will be able to make use of the 30% in the Ordinary Account plus the 4% in the Special Account, if they have exhausted their Ordinary Account. In addition, they will have the 5 percentage points which will be the reduction in the employee's CPF rate. This will go into their \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pocket as increased pay and they can make use of that to service their housing loan instalments. So all in, they will have 30% plus 4% plus 5%, a total of 39% points to service their housing loans. This is almost the same level as before, 40%. In addition, the CPF contribution will increase as salaries increase over the years. So the quantum will increase. We do not think the housing problem will be a serious one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has asked for data on the number of collective agreements which provide for retirement age above 55. I have some data here. If we exclude the marine officers who are on short-term contracts, there are about 933 collective agreements at present. Out of this number, 136 or 15% specify retirement age of 60 years. Some even provide for employment beyond 60, subject to mutual agreement and health permitting. 11 collective agreements provide for retirement at age 57 or 58 years. 67 collective agreements do not specify the retirement age. I think they will follow the norm of 55 at the moment. The remaining 719 collective agreements specify retirement at 55 years, the majority of them with the option to be re-engaged subject to medical fitness and mutual consent. This is the baseline from which we hope in three to four years' time to go generally to 60 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked whether there are any collective agreements where the wage scale is reduced after age 55. I am not sure of this point. But again I want to emphasize that this is not something that will have to apply to everybody. In fact, for those workers who are very valuable to the employers, there is a possibility that the salary will be maintained and therefore with the lower CPF rates they will have more take-home pay. Or to go one step further, if they are really that valuable, through private negotiations, there could be enhancement of salary since the CPF has been reduced. So there will be all kinds of situations. But I think in general where productivity has gone down with \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> age then it is fair that there should be some adjustments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked the question: What are target rates? Do they represent a cap on the CPF rates? I think the Member for Leng Kee also asked a similar question. How long is long-term? The answer is this. We have done a careful study of all the factors and the conclusion is that 40% is enough for the three basic objectives of housing, retirement income and Medisave. Therefore, we will restore the CPF rate progressively to this final 40% and the intention is to hold this 40% for as long as we can to give stability both for employers and employees. But there could be economic situations where we have no choice. For example, there could be a severe bout of recession before we have built up the variable wage component. The preference will be to vary the wage component first and not touch the CPF. We will not touch it unless we cannot avoid it. It will be a kind of last resort. There could be another situation where we have hyper-inflation when it may be wise to soak off some of the money into CPF. Both these situations will be temporary situations, the intention being to restore back to the 40% as soon as possible. This is the meaning of target rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked the question about part-time workers, whether we could lower the rates to encourage their employment. This is something that requires further study. But in relation to this question, I would like to clarify that at present those workers earning below $363 per month, in fact pay less than the full CPF rate. The employers pay the full rate but the employees pay less than the current 25%. Those who are earning less than $200 per month pay nothing. The employee's CPF contribution is zero. At $200, the rate is 10% and then it goes up progressively to 25% at $363 per month. With the cut in the CPF rate on the employee's side, the lower paid workers will similarly get the benefit of lower CPF contributions on their part. In other words, those earning $200 per month will pay eventually 5% instead of 10% and so on. So they will benefit by the full 5 percentage point cut. Most part-time workers, I think, will be in the --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

There is, in fact, already a lower rate for workers who earn less than $363 per month. Most of the part-time workers will probably be in this group and therefore their CPF contribution rate will, in fact, be less than for other workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of problems in reducing the CPF rate for part-time workers. One is that there could a tendency for some workers to take on two part-time jobs instead of one full-time job. The other consideration is that part-time workers also need to have CPF to meet the three basic objectives of housing, Medisave and retirement income. Therefore, there are advantages in having a uniform rate for all categories of workers. But we can look further into this question. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was searching for some data on the number of employees above age 55 years old, in response to the Member for Pasir Panjang's question. Details of CPF members, of course, will be found in the CPF Report. The data here are for employed persons as of now. In the age group 55-59, there are about 37,000 of them; age 60-64, 19,000; age 65- 69, 9,800; age 70-74, 5,300; age 75-79, 1,900; and age above 80, 828. So there are obviously quite a few employees well above 60 years old who are still working. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Radin Mas asked a number of questions. One of them concerns the cash flow problem, the overall liquidity situation. This was also asked, in a different way, by the Member for Whampoa. At the current rate of 35% CPF contribution, the inflow to the CPF Board roughly balances the outflow. We have estimated that if we increase the CPF rate from 35% to 40%, this will result in a net contribution to the CPF of about $600 million per year. This is something that can be tolerated if the restoration is done over a period of years with economic expansion and also as we liberalize the CPF scheme to open up more investment avenues. So the CPF rate of 40% will be tolerable in terms of the impact on our cash flow, exchange rate, and so on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked whether it is contrary to our objective of encouraging the employment of older workers to have an increase in the employer's CPF rate from 10% to 12.5% for members in the age group 55 to 60. This may appear to be an apparent contradiction. But the important thing to note is that the total CPF contribution rate for employees in this age group will be 25% after the full restoration, which is lower than the previous 50% and lower than the 40% for younger workers. Both the employers and employees' CPF are part of wage cost. There could be adjustments to lower the wage cost for those employees in situations where this should be done. But there could be some workers who are age above 55 who deserve what they are being paid and, therefore, in that situation there will be a slight increase in the employer's rate and the employees' own take-home pay will also go up. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked what happens to companies losing money. Well, as I have said, we will implement the adjustments in those years when the economy can afford it. Next year, for example, if the economy continues to do well, then we will make the adjustments. In that kind of situation, hopefully most companies will be making money and able to afford a certain wage increase, from which we will take a certain portion for the CPF to make the restoration. Whether companies are making money or losing money, unfortunately they will still have to pay close to the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> market rates to keep their workers and to make sure they are not too unhappy. So to a certain extent, you can regard this CPF rate as part of market rates. I think these companies should, pursue wage reform vigorously and in that situation a flexible wage will be helpful for them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth question he posed is that since we are limiting the CPF rate to 40%, which is sufficient for the three basic objectives of the CPF scheme, whether this means that there will be more room for individual savings, for example, for use for education. That is, in fact, the philosophy of the Government - that we should not have too high a CPF rate. We should have a rate that is sufficient for the members to cover the three basic objectives of housing, retirement income and Medisave. Beyond that, it would be better for the members to have a higher take-home pay from which they can save on their own for education of their children, for example, or for other uses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa asked about the macro-economic impact. I think I have answered that question. He also asked how we calculate the CPF rate and whether projections could be made available. The calculations are very complicated. We had to go through computers and there is a whole pile of computer printouts. If the Member is interested, I can show them to him. Basically, we have taken a conservative approach. We have assumed certain moderate pay increases. We have calculated in real terms, that means after inflation. We have also assumed the HDB prices prevailing now, with slight adjustments, and so on. On that basis we projected over a long period of about 30 years from the time a new worker starts work at about 21, 22 years and so on, all the way until age 60. So the CPF rate of 40% maintained over that period until age 60 will be sufficient to cover the three objectives I have mentioned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Leng Kee asked a few questions. One was: how long is long-term? I have answered the question. The second one is about assumed inflation rate. We have not assumed the inflation rate as such but we have netted off and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> calculated in real terms what will be the real increase in prices and so forth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He posed this question: why do we not vary the CPF rate with income instead of with age? The thinking is that it is better to vary with age because of three reasons. One is that it is more equitable. Everybody pays the same rate more or less. So whether you are at this income level or that income level, the savings are a certain percentage of your income. There is a good reason for this, and that is, a person's expenditure, needs and saving requirements are related to his income. By so doing, we project on a uniform basis for all the employees and the changes are only done with age, beyond 55, to encourage the employment of these older workers. To a certain extent, it also conforms with the cash flow requirements of the workers as they age. In fact, by so doing we are having a different ceiling of CPF contributions for each individual. It depends on this uniform rate and how long he works and how much his income is. It is a better way than, say, having a quantum limit which would in effect benefit the richer workers who are above the cut-off point and there will be a problem of setting the quantum where, at whatever level, it may be too high for the lower income groups and too low for the high income groups. So the idea is to have a kind of a ceiling that is dependent on your income level. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked for data on aggregate consumption and savings. I do not have these details here. I will supply him later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar, as usual, persists with his question on education. As I have explained, the CPF rate is calculated based on just the three basic needs. That is why we are able to keep it at 40% instead of going all the way up to 50%. If we go all the way up to 50%, it means there will be less take-home pay for the workers. There will be more cash flow soaked up from the economy. Since the CPF rate is only sufficient for the three objectives, it means that if you make any kind of withdrawal from the account for other uses, whatever it is, education for example, it must mean that the savings will be less than adequate for the member concerned. So education has not been taken in as one of the basic \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> objectives of the scheme, the way it is designed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a feeling that the people who are clamouring for the use of CPF for education are the very few privileged ones who can afford to and who want to send their children overseas. It is difficult for the Government to design a scheme to cater for this group of people. Our scheme is meant for the vast majority of CPF members who have very low accounts at the moment. I have mentioned the figure of 85% of CPF members having less than $40,000 in their accounts, excluding housing. If you open this avenue for education, the result will be that there would be more pressure on parents to send their children overseas. As for local education, there is already a loan scheme. I was told by the Minister for Education that, in fact, for this year for the new recruits to NUS and NTI, only about 16% have applied for the soft loan. So, in fact, most parents can afford to send their children to the local universities. But the important point is that we should have a system where the young graduates have a loan and pay off after they graduate, instead of depending on their parents' CPF which are rather low and required for their parents' own old age needs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize that this is an emotional issue and everybody thinks education is very important. I think so too. And that is why the Government is spending so much money on education and is subsidizing it so heavily. But the basic question we have to ask is whether a CPF scheme which is meant for old-age financial security of individual members should be led astray into areas quite unrelated to old age savings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most of the points. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>2.45 pm \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SINGAPORE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore\", \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by the Second Minister for Law (Prof. S.

Its primary function is to license bus routes. It comprises six \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> members, with representaives from different Government departments involved with land transport, such as PWD, HDB and the ROV. BSLA has worked well, as evidenced by the vast network of bus routes serving practically every part of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the formation of the Government Parliamentary Committee (GPC) early this year, Members of the GPC for Communications and Information had various briefings and discussions with Ministry officials. They have acquired a full understanding of the workings of my Ministry and the various statutory boards under the Ministry's charge. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the budget debate in March this year, the Chairman of the GPC pointed out that there was no representative from grassroots organizations such as CASE, CCCs and RCs in the decision process for the determination of routes. He further suggested that such representation be considered as they would serve as useful watchdogs on behalf of the public in matters of fares and bus routes, matters that affect commuters. Furthermore, he highlighted examples of transport authorities in other countries where different transport operators participated, in order to provide a well-integrated public transport system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my reply, I indicated that my Ministry would look into the GPC's suggestion and if there are advantages in having such a Committee with wider representation, my Ministry would certainly consider it. I am now happy to inform the House that, after careful study, my Ministry has accepted the GPC's recommendation. This Public Transport Council Bill seeks to bring about greater public representation in the consideration of land transport matters such as fares and routes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will enable the appointment of 13 members in the PTC, an increase from the six in BSLA, and to enable wide representation from amongst grassroots organizations such as CASE, the CCCs and RCs. We have also incorporated the major operators of land transport systems in Singapore, namely, SBS, TIBS, NTUC \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Comfort and the licensed operators of the MRT System into the PTC, so that the PTC will have first-hand knowledge of the industry that it seeks to supervise. Sir, this practice of including the operators is in line with the practice in many other statutory boards such as PSA, where major operators such as shipping companies and shipowners are invited to serve on the board. Of course, as is common administrative practice, such members will not vote on matters in which they have or are deemed to have an interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC will continue the work of BSLA, namely, to receive and consider applications for the issue of bus service licences for bus routes. This is spelt out in Part IV of the Bill which is taken from the Bus Services Licensing Authority Act. In addition, the PTC will also consider applications for approval of bus, taxi and MRT fares. That way, the PTC can protect the public interest over fares, and ensure that commuters get value for their money. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now deal briefly with the details of the Bill. Part II of the Bill, together with the First Schedule, deals with the establishment, functions, powers and administration of the Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III, together with the Second Schedule, deals with the Financial Provisions and the accounting procedures for the Council. The Council will operate as a non-profit making statutory body with a supporting staff, and will be funded by a Government grant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV, taken from the Bus Services Licensing Authority Act, which will be repealed in Part VI of the Bill, deals with the licensing of bus services. In granting bus licences, the PTC will consider, inter alia, the applicant's ability to maintain an adequate, safe, suitable and efficient service. To ensure that the bus companies which provide an essential service to the public are properly managed, the Bill provides for the Board of Directors of bus companies to consist only of persons approved by the Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V empowers the Council to approve bus, taxi and MRT fares. The setting of fares is essentially a commercial decision, best decided by market forces between the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> commuters and the operators, much as the prices of goods in a supermarket or department store are. The travelling public naturally wants fares to be as low as possible. Transport operators however have to remain financially viable. If the revenue collected does not meet cost, then service must inevitably deteriorate to the detriment of the commuters. Hence it is important for the Council in approving fares to take into account the need for public interest to be safeguarded as well as the need for the operators to remain financially viable so that we will continue to have a safe, suitable, adequate and efficient land transport system in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the best guarantee that fares will be kept low is for operators to be as efficient and productive as possible, and to minimize wasteful duplication of services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final part, Part VI, deals with miscellaneous provisions, including the power for the Council to make regulations for its proper functioning and the repeal of the Bus Services Licensing Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Fengshan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on behalf of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Communications and Information. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the establishment of the Public Transport Council is a step in the right direction. It provides an avenue where the public is represented in a decision-making process regarding issues of public transport. In this forum, operators and representatives from the public can discuss important public transport issues. This concept is new in Singapore and for it to succeed, the constitution, the functions and the powers of the Council are important and have to be very clearly spelt out. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>The Chairman</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, I refer to the constitution of the Council. Under the First Schedule, it will be noted that the chief executives of the four main transport operators will be members of the Council together with not more than nine other members to be appointed by \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Minister. How effective will the Council be? The Council can only be as effective as the members are. Who is the leader of this team? The Chairman, of course. The Chairman will be appointed by the Minister. It is our hope that the Chairman will be an eminent community leader, totally apart from the operators. He should also not be an official from the Ministry of Communications and Information. This is suggested as it is important to ensure that an independent member of the public chairs the PTC. An independent chairman is important because the major transport operators will already be represented on the Council by their chief executives. These CEOs are knowledgeable people and will come to the Council backed by computer printouts of facts and figures to support their case. They will also have the benefit of consultant's reports, case simulations, etc. The other nine appointed members will not have this privilege except perhaps if they are officials from the Ministry of Communications and Information. Thus the role of the Chairman is crucial to the success of the PTC. An independent, unbiased but knowledgeable Chairman is essential. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next turn to the operators. As has been mentioned, the chief executives of the four main transport operators will be on the Council. However, one should be mindful of the interest of the smaller operators. For example, in buses, there are Scheme B buses and other operators to consider. In taxis, there are the yellow-top taxis and others to consider. It is our fervent hope that the small operators' interest will be taken seriously into account by the PTC in all its deliberations. This is very important as many, for example, a yellow-top taxi owner may be the sole breadwinner of the family. Today, many Scheme B operators are already expressing apprehension regarding their fate. A reassurance from the Minister would be most welcome. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Functions of the Council</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large portion of the PTC Bill concerns the licensing of bus services. And with the enactment of this Bill, the Bus Services Licensing Authority Act will be repealed. The BSLA Act, as has been mentioned by the Minister, has served its function well in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the past. The PTC Bill, whilst encompassing BSLA Act, has two added functions that never existed under the BSLA Act. These are, firstly, to integrate routes and fares, and secondly, to provide for public participation in a decision-making process with regard to public transport. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the functions of the Council, Part II, clause 4 (c) reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'to regulate bus routes and bus, taxi and Mass Rapid Transit System fares;' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the view of the GPC and the resource panel that integration should be specifically spelt out as a function even though one may read this as implied in this section. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly under the First Schedule, public participation is implied through the appointment of \"not more than 9 other persons\" by the Minister to sit on the Council. The GPC is again of the view that, as public participation is a cardinal principle in this Bill, the issue of public participation should also be included as a function of the Council. This would make it clear to the members of the PTC in no uncertain terms that integration and public participation are functions as important as the others mentioned in the Bill as it now stands. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Powers of the Council</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PTC has been given wide powers under Part II Section 5 to effectively discharge its function. Under Section 5(a) the PTC may \"approve new bus routes and amend or delete existing bus routes\". Having been given this power, one has to ask whether it would be prudent to prescribe certain criteria so that the PTC can be guided and the public can be kept informed. One also has to ask whether this applies to the MRT. We all understand that there is severe restriction to change of rail routes, but one cannot discount this possibility in the future. Does the PTC have similar powers over the MRT? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly under the Functions of the PTC, Section 4(a) states \"The functions of the Council are to receive and consider applications for the issue of bus service licences.\" Should not the PTC have the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> power or at least have a say regarding the licensing of the MRT operator rather than leaving this to the sole discretion of the MRTC? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part I Section 2 of the Act, the definition of a \"public service vehicle\" also excludes the MRT. I quote the definition of a \"public service vehicle\" means a vehicle used or kept for use for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward, other than a vehicle constructed for use on fixed rails or specially prepared ways.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should this definition not be reviewed to include the MRT? I am sure that we all agree that the MRT train is a public service vehicle. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5(b) refers to the Council appointing \"an agent to do anything which the Council may do\". Here I would like to ask the Minister as to his thinking on this issue. The GPC has been informed that in the first instance the Registry of Vehicles will assist the PTC in carrying out its functions. The GPC agrees that this is a logical first step. However, it is our opinion that in the long-term the PTC and the ROV must remain as separate entities if the purpose is indeed to allow the PTC to function as an autonomous and objective unit. To this end, the GPC considers that the PTC should look into setting up its own resource unit and to capture the expertise of the MRTC/Bus Integration Committees before it is disbanded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I next turn to the question of fares. I have dealt earlier with the question of integration of fares being a function of the PTC, and I will not labour this point any further. I refer now to Part V Section 21, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In considering any application for approval of bus, taxi or Mass Rapid Transit System rate of hire or fare, the Council shall take into account - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the need for the applicants to remain financially viable; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the need for public interest to be safeguarded\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21 requires further clarification. Does this section imply a guarantee of profit for operators? If so, at whose expense? It must certainly be at the public's expense. Similarly, the safeguarding of public interest, if carried out to the extreme, could result in the operator \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> making a loss and to a deterioration in the standard of services provided by the operators. I seek the Minister's clarification on this section. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several members of the public have asked me the question whether members of the GPC would be sitting on the Public Transport Council. We have discussed this matter in the GPC with our resource panel and with the Ministry of Communications and Information. The unanimous view is that the GPC should continue to maintain its independence and objectivity. No member of the GPC will thus sit on the PTC. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, we are aware of the great challenge to the PTC. We wish them every success and pledge our support and cooperation to them. Although I have highlighted only the areas of concern, or the parts of the Bill which we seek clarification, I wish to state that we in principle give our wholehearted support to this Bill. We realize that the Ministry is working under considerable time and other constraints and congratulate them on this effort. As the PTC moves into action, I am sure that amendments to the Bill will be made as and when required, and I hope that our comments will not be forgotten but will be given serious consideration. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise to support this Bill as moved by the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this Public Transport Council is a desirable vehicle to rationalize bus fares, taxi fares and MRT fares. However, like the Chairman of the GPC who has just spoken, I question whether the functions of this Council are comprehensive enough because there is no mention there and there is no explicit mention of licensing of taxis, neither is there mention of any power over the frequency of MRT services. The way the functions are listed in clause 4 of this Act appears to me that the bus system is used as a residual system, in other words, to take care of any excess or any necessary increase in supply of services after the taxis and MRTs have performed their services in accordance with the fares. I think for the Council to be really effective, it has got to take an overview, a comprehensive view, of not only the bus \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> routes but the number of taxis which are on the road and the frequency of MRT services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other important factor that should not be overlooked is that there is no way one can guarantee the efficiency of the MRT or the bus system. At least for the taxi operators there is sufficient competition to assure that the best and the most efficient services are forthcoming. But for bus operators and the MRT, one can only rely on the management expertise. I think historical experience here in Singapore bears this out - that until the Government sent in the team of officials into the Singapore Bus Services Company, the bus services were being provided very inefficiently. I am afraid there may come a time where in order to guarantee viability to the bus services and to the MRT, fares would have to be increased continually. So there should be some mechanism to ensure that the MRT and the bus companies provide the best management possible, that they run their services as efficiently as possible. But this Bill does not provide for any such safeguard. In other words, if the bus companies were to present a proposal for an increase in fares on the ground that otherwise the bus services will not be viable, how would this Public Transport Council respond? It would simply have to look at the book and say, \"Yes, we agree and we increase the bus fares.\" But if the operators are hiding some money behind the scene, siphoning off money, and in a bus service with a lot of cash flow, it is easy to siphon off the cash that flows into the coffers of the bus companies without anybody noticing. So without good, efficient management, I do not see how we can have an efficient system at least cost to the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the two Members for speaking on the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Fengshan who spoke on behalf of the Government Parliamentary Committee has raised a number of points. Sir, the Member has rightly pointed out the importance of the role of the Chairman in a statutory board. Indeed the Chairman is the key figure in any statutory board and the appointment of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> such a Chairman has always been undertaken by the Government with great care, simply because statutory boards have statutory powers and these powers have got to be exercised responsibly by the individual and his Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in looking for a Chairman of a statutory board, the Government looks for a person with integrity, a person with proven ability and experience, a person preferably with a record of public service, having demonstrated in other statutory boards as a member, his capability and dedication to the public service. And of course, if at all possible, the Chairman of any statutory board should have some experience in the particular industry that he will supervise. And, of course, the Chairman must be somebody willing to give of his time and his effort in order to serve the Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of the factors that we will have to take into account when we consider the appointment of the Chairman for the Public Transport Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked about the rules as applied to the smaller operators. Sir, rules made by the Public Transport Council will apply to all operators, whether they are big or small. I can assure the House that all applicants will be treated fairly by the Public Transport Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the supplementary Scheme B buses. Sir, these buses will continue to have a role as they have at the moment. Their role primarily is to supplement, as the name implies, to supplement the existing scheduled buses and they will continue with that role, supplementing the scheduled buses in their new routes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked about public participation. Sir, I have indicated in my Second Reading that we will be including members from various grassroots organizations. These will come from the Consumers Association, the CCCs and the RCs. So there will be public participation in the Public Transport Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa together with the Member for Fengshan mentioned \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the possibility of spelling out in greater detail the functions of the Public Transport Council. Sir, some of the details indeed are mentioned in clauses 11(a) to (e) and 12(a) to (e). We believe that the Act as it stands, taken from BSLA, is effective in giving the Council sufficient leeway to make decisions that are necessary. Quite obviously, the guidelines for the determination of a route that serves a rural area will have to be slightly different from the factors that will be taken into account in the determination of a route for an urban area. Rather than putting the Council into a straitjacket by having too many rules, it is better to have general principles like those that have been outlined in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Fengshan asked about MRT routes. Once the rail has been constructed and the stations put up, it is unlikely that we will want to change the routes. The matter of determination of routes by the Public Transport Council for the MRT system will not be relevant at the moment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked why the MRT system is treated slightly differently from buses. The MRT system is an extremely complex system. There is a pool of expertise already existing in the MRTC. Rather than duplicating all the functions of the MRTC in the PTC, it is preferable for the MRTC to serve as the supervising statutory board for matters concerning the maintenance, operations and safety of the MRT system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Members for Whampoa and Fengshan asked about fares and seek clarification on the two statements found in clause 21 regarding \"the need for operators to remain financially viable and the need for public interest to be safeguarded.\" I have mentioned in my Second Reading speech that it is important that we safeguard the public interest. It is the purpose of the Public Transport Council to ensure that while we leave as much as possible, fares to be determined by market forces, to be determined by cost factors, such as labour costs, fuel costs and other costs which add to the total cost of the bus companies, the Public Transport Council is in a position to act as a watchdog on behalf of the public. I mentioned also that obviously commuters want fares to be as \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> low as possible but we must bear in mind that the bus companies have got to be viable. If bus companies are not viable, then sooner or later the bus companies will wind down on the services that they provide. Bus companies will reduce the number of services. They may have to lower maintenance. They may have to use older buses. They may have to reduce frequency. And these are factors that will not contribute to a better, safer or more adequate transport system for the people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing, Sir, as I mentioned earlier, is to ensure that the bus companies are efficiently managed. This is why there is a clause inside the Public Transport Council Bill giving the Public Transport Council the authority to approve the board of directors for these companies. That way, we ensure that the bus companies are well managed. Members of the House may remember way back in the late 60s and early 70s when a number of bus companies were very badly managed. Some of them went bankrupt and as a result of that land transportation in Singapore was severely disrupted. That is the sort of situation that we do not want to happen again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Fengshan also asked about the ROV. The ROV and the Public Transport Council are two distinct bodies. The ROV has its primary function of registering vehicles on our roads and of ensuring and maintaining the safety standards of our public service vehicles. ROV has over the last decade or so built up a pool of expertise. They have an army of computers to help resolve many of the problems in their area of responsibility. They have built up expertise in software. They have also a collection of maps and routes. These can be of use in the initial stages to the Public Transport Council as it seeks to take off with the minimum of teething problems. In the initial stages, I think it would be useful for the ROV to assist the Public Transport Council. Once the Public Transport Council finds its own feet, it should operate independently of the ROV. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have covered the questions raised by the two Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> Sir, may I just clarify one point? When I referred to MRT routes, I was referring to the future routes that will be taken and I asked whether if the MRTC wanted to extend the route in the future, will it have to go through the PTC? Will the PTC have a say in the future? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, future lines of the MRT system will to a very large extent be determined by the Ministry for National Development, in fact, by the HDB, because future lines will go to the new housing estates with heaviest population concentration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Yeo Ning Hong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MASS RAPID TRANSIT CORPORATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.24 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong (Minister for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Communications and Information (Dr Yeo Ning Hong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the Parliamentary sitting in March this year, I gave this House a progress report on the construction of the MRT system. I indicated that the first train is expected to begin its public service in early December this year, running from Yio Chu Kang to Toa Payoh, and then towards the end of the year to Outram Park. The Mass Rapid Transit Corporation has maintained good progress and the project is still on schedule. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also indicated that detailed studies are undertaken to look into how we can privatize the MRT operations. Members of the House will recall that the objective of privatization is to ensure that the MRT system will be run efficiently and be more responsive to the changing needs of the travelling public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the impending commencement of operation and privatization of the MRT \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> system have made it necessary to update the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation Act. The amendments in this Bill are divided into four main categories:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, amendments related to the operation of the MRT system by a licensee; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, provisions required for the purpose of operating the railway; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, provisions relating to the safety of the railway; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, other incidental amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now highlight the major amendments. Clause 3 of the Bill provides for amendment to section 4 of the MRTC Act so as to allow the Corporation to become a regulatory and licensing authority of the MRT system, in addition to its primary role as the builder of the MRT lines. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the Corporation to license the MRT operations to any such company that it deems fit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that there be sufficient safeguards to protect the travelling public and the MRT system which is a national asset. As such, in clause 5 the considerations in granting a licence are the financial standing of the licensee and its ability to maintain an adequate, safe, satisfactory, and efficient service. The MRTC may impose conditions relating to the general level of service, the safety of persons using the railway and the maintenance and operation of the railway. The MRTC can suspend or revoke the licence if the licensee fails or is likely to fail to provide and maintain an adequate, safe, satisfactory, and efficient service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the MRTC Act deals only with the construction of the MRT system. So, amendments to the MRTC Act are necessary to enable efficient operation of the railway. So clauses 7 and 8 permit the Corporation or any person authorized by the Corporation to enter upon State or other land within the railway area for the purpose of operation and maintenance of the railway. The MRT system when fully operational is projected to have about \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1398</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 860,000 passenger trips daily. It is therefore essential that the system be operated and maintained safely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidental to the operation of the MRT system by a licensee, the provisions presently in the MRTC Act concerning the rights to claim compensation from the Corporation have been extended to the licensee in clauses 9 and 10. Procedures for making such claims shall apply to the licensee as with the MRTC. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill inserts a new Part VIA to the Act relating to the safety of the railway. One of the provisions, for example, empowers the Minister to appoint inspectors to carry out inspections for the purpose of ensuring the safety of the railway or when an accident has occurred on any part of the railway. The Bill also makes it an offence to wilfully do any act which endangers the safety of any traveller, for which on conviction there is a maximum fine of $10,000 or imprisonment of up to five years or both. The provisions pertaining to the safety of the railway are similar to those provided in other MRT systems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 of the Bill gives the Corporation powers to make regulations on matters concerning the maintenance, use, operation, and safety of the railway, the protection of the property of the railway, and the powers and duties of inspectors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 17 adds a new Schedule to the Act which gives the MRTC or permitted parties the exclusive right to use the well-known MRT logo. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just want to raise a point with the Minister that relates to section 48(G), subsection (2) on the use of the symbol belonging to the MRT. In most countries the underground or mass rapid system tends to be part of the tourist highlights. Such Mass Transit symbols tend to appear in most tourist items like T-shirts, souvenirs, and so on. And many small companies do take advantage of this symbol \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> by making tourist items out of it. So I do not see why there should be a need in our case to protect the symbol exclusively for the use of the MRT. I think the symbol should be treated just like the Merlion or the Singapore Lion which many Singapore companies take advantage by making some business out of it to promote Singapore. More importantly, everyone should be able to use it and not to restrict it only to the use of the MRT. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as stated, the symbol should be used by the Corporation or permitted parties. Sir, we want to ensure that the MRT logo does not go on to undesirable products. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Surely the situation is the same for the Singapore Lion or the Merlion, is it not? This is a national symbol. We do not want it to be used for undesirable purposes. But why must we license it? Why must we get permission for it? And how does one ensure that licence will be granted? And what is the appeal process for the person who has written to the Corporation for permission and has been refused and there is no ground given? What can he do about it? Can he appeal to the Minister? But the point really is, why should that be the case? I think it should be made completely free for everyone to use. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the MRT system represents a gigantic step for us in the development of our land transport system. The logo has now been associated with that major project. It is a project that all Singaporeans are proud of. I would prefer that we move cautiously rather than open the floodgates, and to find the symbol used to market all kinds of undesirable products. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Yeo Ning Hong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1400</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PUBLIC SERVICE (VARIATION OF 1984 ANNUAL WAGE INCREASES) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>3.35 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has decided that wage restraint in the public sector should continue for another year with effect from 1st July 1987. The Ministry of Finance (Public Service Division) met with the public sector staff unions and associations in January this year and they reached a consensus that the wage restraint measure to be adopted by the public sector for the second year shall be (in addition to the withdrawal of the Incentive Payment) a reduction of the 1984 National Wages Council wage increase by 30% for all monthly-rated officers and by 10% for the daily-rated employees. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the payment of NWC wage increases is embodied as an express term in letters of appointment, legislation has to be introduced to effect the reduction of the 1984 NWC wage increase. Hence this Bill is now being introduced in Parliament. The Bill will not involve Government in any extra financial expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I would like to inform Members that the reduction of the 1984 wage increases applies to all employees in the public service, including those in any statutory body or authority, those on contract and part-time employment, as well as holders of political office and Members of Parliament. Other holders of public office whose remuneration is provided for under the Constitution have also consented to have their 1984 NWC wage increase reduced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Geylang Serai):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this wage restraint measure in the public service is implemented now at a time when the economy is showing signs of strong recovery. The economic growth for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1401</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the first quarter of 1987 is now revised to 7%. And we have heard that the second quarter growth will also be around this figure. This quick turnaround is possible because of the effectiveness of the measures like wage restraint, reduction in employer's CPF contribution by 15% points as well as external factors. Further, the recovery is broad based. Except for the construction sector, all other sectors are growing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the question arises, and this is asked by many public servants: why, with the economy now showing strong recovery, is there a need to continue with this wage restraint measure in the public sector? The public sector unions agreed to this measure in January 1987 when the economy was still in recession. I think public service union leaders are responsible and they are prepared to accept any measure to help the economy come out of the recession. Now the economy is growing strongly. Are such counter-recessionary measures still necessary? And for this purpose even low salaried public service employees, like the daily-rated employees and the Division 4 employees, have to make sacrifices. They had made sacrifices in 1985 by forgoing their NWC increases. There was in 1986 the withdrawal of the incentive payments. Now, is it still necessary for them to continue to endure more sacrifices? Those in the maximum of their salary scales will, in fact, suffer a pay cut since they do not have any annual increment. In the private sector, with the labour market tightening up, free market forces have caused wages to go up, especially starting wages, as employers compete for workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to re-examine this wage restraint measure, particularly for the low wage earners in the public service. We want to introduce flexibility in our wage system. During time of good economic or business performance, workers should be able to enjoy better wages for the hard work, for the sacrifices, for their contribution to enable the economy to recover. And it is only fair since they have taken a responsible and positive attitude. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1402</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another measure which I would like to ask the Minister to consider is whether in the event our economic growth this year exceeds the earlier forecast of 4-5%, whether public servants would be given an additional one- time lump sum payment on top of the usual non-pensionable annual payment of one month salary. I would like to ask the Minister to give an assurance that this would be given careful consideration by his Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Member for Geylang Serai for his comments. But I should like to point out that it is premature to assume that the year as a whole would turn out to be so buoyant that we can abandon the wage restraint measures recommended and agreed earlier this year. I would prefer to urge a somewhat more conservative approach. The first quarter was strong indeed, 7%, and indications are that the second quarter is likely to be reasonably good. But for the year as a whole I would prefer to withhold premature comment until we see how things appear nearer the end of this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recovery has been strong in a number of sectors, particularly, electronics. However, there are still quite a few sectors which are depressed. Construction is one which has been mentioned. Others include the hotel industry. I think mostly the retail business is still depressed and it is only in some sectors of the manufacturing and financial services where you see strong growth. Overall, we have relatively uneven growth with prospects for stronger growth extending to other sectors in the second half. So my belief is that the measures Government has taken, which form part of the wage restraint measures accepted by the public at large, should be maintained until we see more clearly how the year progresses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question as to whether additional payment might be made, it is certainly something we can take into consideration. Again, I would prefer not to make any promises in advance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1403</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1403</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>RUBBER DEALERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two separate agencies presently issue licenses for the rubber trade: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Land Office, which administers the Rubber Dealers Act, issues licences to purchase, to treat and to store rubber. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Rubber Association of Singapore (RAS), which administers the Rubber Industry Act, issues licences to pack and ship rubber and to manufacture technically specified rubber. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be more efficient for a single agency to be responsible for promoting and regulating the rubber trade in Singapore. This is, in fact, the mission of the Rubber Association of Singapore. The Government is therefore transferring the administration of the Rubber Dealers Act from the Land Office to the RAS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licensing procedures will also be simplified. In place of three separate licences to purchase, to treat and to store rubber, one new licence, a Rubber Dealer's Licence, will be issued. The $1,000 deposit for issuing this licence will be waived. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the penalties will be enhanced in order that they remain a deterrent. The maximum fine for failing to comply with the provisions of the Act will be raised from $2,000 to $5,000 and for failing to comply with the rules made under the Act the fine will be raised from $100 to $1,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the RAS takes over the administration of the Rubber Dealers Act, the revenue from the licence fees will be paid into the Singapore Rubber Fund established under the RAS (Incorporation) Act. Any revision of the licence fees will be approved by the Minister for Trade and Industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1404</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also introduces other minor consequential amendments to the Act to simplify licensing procedures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1404</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>POISONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>3.48 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Acting Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Acting Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poisons (Amendment) Bill aims to amend certain provisions of the Poisons Act (Chapter 234) so as to bring it up to date and to rectify the inadequacies in the present Act. The control of poisons is effected under the Poisons Act by inspectors from the Ministry of Health. All poisons imported into the country have to be declared at the point of entry. Only authorized persons are allowed to deal in poisons. Unauthorized possession for sale of poisons is illegal. Offenders, when convicted, are liable to a fine of up to a maximum of $5,000 or to imprisonment up to a maximum of two years, or both. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Poisons Act does not differentiate between the control of industrial and agricultural poisons from medicinal poisons. The control of industrial and agricultural poisons was originally carried out with the help of the Public Health Division which was then part of the Ministry of Health. In late 1971, the Public Health Division was incorporated as part of the Ministry of the Environment. The result of this move was that applications for licences for industrial and agricultural poisons received by the Ministry of Health had to be referred to the Ministry of the Environment for processing. The Ministry of the Environment then advises the Ministry of Health of its decisions, which then issues the licences. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1405</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> The reason for this cumbersome practice is the lack of a provision in the existing Act for the delegation of this licensing function to other public officers. The proposed amendment Bill seeks to rectify this anomaly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another limitation of the Poisons Act is in the penalties presently prescribed. The present penalties are inadequate for the gravity of the offences that are being committed. It is therefore proposed to increase the maximum fines from $5,000 to $10,000 with the same jail term of a maximum of two years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past two years, the Ministry's Inspectorate conducted 271 raids on shops suspected of illegal sale of poisons. Ninety-one premises were found to be selling poisons illegally, of which nine were repeat offenders. The poisons found in these premises included antibiotics and steroids which are illegally sold to the public without any doctor's prescription or are used to adulterate traditional medicines. An example is penicillin and tetracycline which are sold under the counter to the public to prevent or to treat sexually transmitted diseases. Because of this, resistance to antibiotics is becoming a significant problem in the treatment of veneral diseases in Singapore today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the use of the antibiotic, chloramphenicol, which is illegally added to traditional medicines for the treatment of simple fevers which normally would not require anything more than, for example, a Panadol or an Aspirin. This particular antibiotic is known to occasionally produce very harmful effects on the blood and bone marrow which could be fatal. As a result of such unsupervised consumption, the patient's life is unnecessarily endangered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illegal sale of steroids by some shops to treat asthma, skin diseases and rheumatic or joint pains is also very common. Whilst the person is temporarily relieved of the symptoms, the prolonged and indiscriminate use of steroids has harmful effects on the body. This unlawful use in the end could be more serious to the patient than his simple aches and pains. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1406</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now take you through some of the key clauses in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 empowers the Director of Medical Services to authorize any public officer to issue licences for the purposes of this Act. This will allow the delegation to officers of the Ministry of the Environment the authority to issue licences in respect of industrial and agricultural poisons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 empowers a licensing officer to issue licences for any of the purposes of the Act. Presently, there are four different types of licences specified in the Poisons Act. These four licences and classifications have caused much confusion to the public. With the proposed amendment, there will only be two licences, one to import, store and sell poisons by wholesale, and the second licence to import, store and sell poisons by retail. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The period of validity of the licences to be prescribed by rules made under the Act will be extended to beyond the one year period currently prescribed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 amends section 17(1) of the Act by increasing the maximum fine for offences under the Act from $5,000 to $10,000. As explained to Members earlier, the present fine is inadequate in view of the gravity of the offences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 amends section 20 of the Act by increasing the maximum fine for selling poisons to persons under 18 years of age from $500 to $1,000. The existing maximum fine of $500 was set in 1938 when the Act was first enacted. Members will appreciate that doubling the maximum fine to $1,000 will only slightly compensate for the inflation which has taken place over the last 50 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Act, there is no flexibility to prescribe lower penalties for minor technical offences such as improper labelling of poisons or inadequate record keeping. Clause 9 is an addition to the Act which empowers the Minister to prescribe lower penalties for such minor technical offences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the passing of this Bill, the Poisons Act will be brought up to date and the inadequacies rectified. The increase in the maximum penalties will serve as a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1407</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> greater deterrent against the illegal sale of poisons and to ensure better compliance to the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Kaki Bukit):</b> Sir, I rise to speak on the Bill on behalf of the GPC for Environment and Health. The GPC is of the opinion that the amendments are necessary and indeed could have been made earlier. But this was not possible because the Ministry of the Environment was not ready then to take over the issue of licences and permits for hazardous substances. It is clear from what the Minister has just said that the amendments are made with three objectives in mind: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to delegate authority to the Ministry of the Environment for the issue of licences for hazardous industrial chemicals; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to simplify existing licensing procedures; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to impose harsher penalties for those who commit offences under the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, attempts at simplifying the existing licensing procedures are laudable. They reflect the Government's continuing emphasis to reduce red-tape and to provide greater flexibility to the private sector businessmen. Whilst the GPC appreciates the need for the Ministry of Health to streamline licensing procedures and delegate authority to the Ministry of the Environment for the issue of licences and permits for hazardous industrial substances, we think that problems and confusion may arise in practice with two Ministries administering the Act. The public may not know which Ministry to go to obtain a licence or a permit for a particular substance or to launch a complaint against a particular licensee. Under the Bill, the Director of Medical Services will be responsible for maintaining a master register of all licensees which includes licensees of hazardous industrial chemicals. Should not the maintenance of a master register on such licensees be left to the Ministry of the Environment? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are some of the examples to show the confusion in the implementation \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of the Act if administered separately by two Ministries. There is therefore a great need for the two Ministries to coordinate closely in the implementation of the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hazardous industrial chemicals and medicinal poisons are two different types of chemicals. In practice, the import, transport, storage, use and disposal of industrial chemicals and medicinal poisons are different. The GPC is therefore of the view that it will be necessary in the longer term for the Poisons Act to be replaced by two new Acts such as (a) the Medicinal Poisons and Drugs Act and (b) the Hazardous Industrial Substances Act, with the legislation and administration of the Medicinal Poisons and Drugs Act under the Ministry of Health while that of the Hazardous Industrial Substances Act under the Ministry of the Environment. This will go a long way to avoid confusion and ensure more efficient administration of the laws governing medicinal poisons and hazardous industrial substances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment to increase the maximum penalty from $500 to $1,000 for those who commit offences under the Act is, to serve as a strong deterrent to illegal practices, particularly to those caught selling poisons without a licence or in unlicensed premises. It appears from what the Minister has said that the problem of infringement of the Act - of illegal import and sale of poisons - is indeed a serious one. Doubling the fine in this instance may not be enough. The GPC urges the Ministry to step up enforcement actions against these offenders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to this problem is the concern expressed by some that drugs banned in developed countries are still being imported and sold in developing countries. Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what measures the Ministry of Health is taking to ensure that this does not happen in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I agree with the Member for Kaki Bukit that the present arrangement is still not the ideal arrangement, and I would like to inform him that the Ministry of the Environment is looking into ways of improving it, including the possibility of enacting a separate legislation that would \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> enable the Ministry to properly control the import, sale, storage, and transportation of hazardous substances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Member that increasing the penalties will not by itself lead to the curtailment of those illegal activities that some shops are engaging in. I wish to assure him that the Ministry will continue to take strong enforcement actions to ensure that those shops that are continuing to sell such drugs illegally can be detected and brought to justice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to drugs that have been banned elsewhere, the Ministry receives regular notification from the World Health Organization on drugs that have been banned from sale elsewhere. When informed by the World Health Organization, the Ministry's Inspectorate will then do a check on whether those drugs are on sale in Singapore and, if they are, order their removal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LAND TITLES (STRATA) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.05 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S.

They made valuable suggestions, many of which have now been accepted and incorporated in the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Select Committee was presented to this House on 25th June 1987. The Bill, as set out in Appendix I of the Report, incorporates various amendments made by the Select Committee. The explanations for all the amendments are contained in Appendix V of the Report. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for the Bill itself was well covered by the Minister for Law during the Second Reading. I shall therefore not repeat them nor the explanations which are set out in detail. I propose only to draw the attention of hon. Members to some of the more important changes which have been recommended by the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Share value</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended section 7 in clause 4 of the Bill prohibits a developer from selling any unit in a subdivided building unless a schedule of strata units with share value shown in respect of each unit has been filed with and accepted by the Commissioner of Buildings. The Commissioner is required to give his decision within six weeks of the filing of the schedule of strata units or of any subsequent amended schedule. A developer cannot change the share value assigned to a unit that has been sold unless he obtains the purchaser's consent. However, the purchaser's consent is not required for minor adjustments to the share value after the unit has been surveyed on completion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 10A in clause 6 makes it clear that the share value of a strata lot shown on a strata title plan registered with the Registrar of Titles cannot be varied except by the Registrar of Titles for correction of technical errors or by the Court where it is satisfied that the share value was assigned fraudulently to the lot. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties of developers</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new section 31 at page 15 of the Bill requires a developer of a subdivided building to open an account with a bank in the name of the management corporation upon the establishment of the management corporation and to pay into that account for the benefit of members of the management corporation any surplus funds in the trust fund which was earlier set up by the developer for the main- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tenance of the building pursuant to section 9 of the Buildings and Common Property (Maintenance and Management) Act. The developer is also required to keep proper accounting records for audit purposes for the period when he is in control of the management corporation prior to the election of council members at the first annual general meeting of the management corporation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Annual general meetings</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The developer is also required to convene the first meeting of the management corporation within one month of the expiry of the 'initial period' or within six weeks of a request in writing made by the subsidiary proprietors of not less than one-tenth of the total number of strata lots, whichever is the earlier. The Select Committee has introduced this more flexible definition of 'initial period' and the period is now 24 months from the date of establishment of the management corporation or such other period as may be substituted by regulations made under the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Subdivision of strata lot affecting common property</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A subsidiary proprietor of a lot must obtain the prior approval of the management corporation if he divides the lot in such a manner as will result in the creation of additional or new common property. In other words, this provision seeks to protect the interest of existing subsidiary proprietors of other lots and to ensure that they will not have to bear the burden of maintaining any additional common property thrown up by the redevelopment of a lot. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Recovery of maintenance contributions</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the new section 40 a prior mortgagee of a unit has to take into account any contribution due and owing to the management corporation. The mortgagee's power of overreaching the outstanding contributions is curtailed when he exercises the power of sale to recover monies secured by the mortgage which are due from the subsidiary proprietor of a lot. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, I want to touch on certain provisions dealing with Council members, managing agents and penalties. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1412</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Council members</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 63 in page 57 of the Bill requires council members to disclose their interest in any contract or proposed contract with the management corporation. The reason for this new provision is to seek to curb abuses by council members. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Managing agents</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 65 requires a managing agent who is directly or indirectly related to a proprietor of a lot to declare the nature of his relationship prior to his appointment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Penalty</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 64 makes it an offence for a member of the council or a managing agent of a management corporation to use his or their position to gain directly or indirectly an advantage for himself or other persons or to cause detriment to the management corporation. In other words, Sir, these provisions are to prevent abuse, malpractice and corruption. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Insurance</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions on insurances to be effected by management corporations and subsidiary proprietors of lots in a subdivided building have been revised by the Select Committee to take care of the comments of insurers, developers, subsidiary proprietors and mortgagees. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Strata Titles Board</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the attention of hon. Members to the new Part VI in the Bill which deals with the establishment of strata titles boards. Several representors made requests to the Select Committee urging the establishment of such boards, and to follow the example of New South Wales, Australia, where there is legislation providing for the establishment of strata titles boards to adjudicate disputes between subsidiary proprietors and management corporations and between one subsidiary proprietor and another. As at 9th July 1987, based on the records at the Registry of Titles, there are more than 1,200 management corporations in Singapore in charge of more than 54,000 strata \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> units. If such disputes were not to be adjudicated by the strata titles boards, they will have to be resolved in the courts. Proceedings in the courts are complex, protracted and costly. Furthermore, we should not overload our courts with such disputes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, Sir, let me say that the changes in the Bill, as reported, are quite technical. The Select Committee was grateful for assistance given by members of the Law Society as well as other representors. I believe that the changes in the Bill, as reported, significantly improves the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am happy to note that various suggestions which were made during the Select Committee's hearings have been incorporated in the Bill. Therefore, I would like to commend the Select Committee for their thoroughness in going through the Bill and the Second Minister for Law's report to this House on the changes that have been incorporated in this Bill. Changes have also been introduced to make provisions in the Bill more clear. These include a new definition of subsidiary proprietor, amendment to section 6 to define charge and so on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note also that the Ministry has studied Land Title Strata legislations in other countries and has incorporated in this Report useful features found in such legislations. For example, as indicated by the Second Minister for Law, the new section 66 which is based on a similar provision found in the New South Wales legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the introduction of the new Part VI to provide for the establishment of one or more strata titles boards to adjudicate disputes between subsidiary proprietors and between management corporations and subsidiary proprietors. These boards will help ensure that such disputes will be more expeditiously dealt with. It will, of course, save both time and money for those involved in disputes arising from the use or occupation of lots in subdivided buildings. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1414</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, the introduction of these changes will help ensure that subdivided buildings will be more effectively managed. But perhaps when the Bill is passed, the provisions should be reviewed from time to time to ensure that the management of the subdivided buildings is effective. Therefore, the Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill is a complex legislation. It is important therefore for the Ministry of Law to embark on a public education programme to help the public to get a better understanding of the provisions in the Bill. This is necessary because almost 90% of our population live and work in highrise buildings. They would indeed like to know how this Bill will affect them. I hope, Sir, that the Hon. Minister will look into this and consider ways to help the public to get a clearer understanding of the provisions in the Bill and the impact the Bill will have on them and their properties in highrise buildings. For example, with the assistance of the media, some of the key provisions could be presented in simpler layman's language with interesting examples thrown in to help the general public to better understand them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the GPC on National Development and Housing, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I thank the Member for Punggol, who is also the Chairman of the GPC on National Development, for his favourable comment. He has made a specific suggestion of conveying the key provisions of the Bill to members of the public in a form which is easily understood and shorn of all the technical legalisms. I think this is a good idea and my Ministry, together with the Ministry of National Development which has also an interest in the implementation of this Bill, will liaise to see how best it can be done. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at Nineteen\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Minutes past Four o'clock pm.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>BY-ELECTIONS IN ANSON AND GEYLANG WEST</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Prime Minister what are the reasons for not holding the by-elections at Anson and Geylang West Constituencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Government has decided to establish town councils to take over the responsibility and authority of managing some aspects of public housing.

After that, contiguous constituencies will have to be identified for grouping as town council constituencies. This may require a redelineation of electoral boundaries. Anson and Geylang West constituencies may or may not be affected by the grouping of constituencies and changes of electoral boundaries. Until the legislation is ready and the town council constituencies finalised, no by-election will be held in Anson and Geylang West constituencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>1987 NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS BUDGET</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Prime Minister how much money will be spent to stage the 1987 National Day Celebrations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The budget for the 1987 National Day Celebrations is $1,139,880. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be the first time the National Day Parade at the Padang is held from dusk to nightfall. It will allow the Parade to include a pageant of lighted floats and a fireworks performance, as well as the use of lighting effects for display items on the Padang. The budget includes a sum of $600,000 for setting up the necessary infrastructure, underground cables and equipment to provide lighting at the Padang. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accounts for actual expenditures are finalised several months after the event. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TAN WAH PIOW AND THE MARXIST PLOT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs whether Tan Wah Piow or people behind him were the masterminds of the recent Government alleged Marxist plot to destabilise Singapore; and, if the latter, if he will identify those people. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S.

In view of his sympathies for, and links with, the CPM (about which several of the detainees who are his close associates related on television), we have good reasons to conclude that Tan Wah Piow is not the mastermind behind the larger, more dangerous communist conspiracy. Until we interrogate Tan Wah Piow, we cannot be certain of the identity of persons or groups immediately behind Tan Wah Piow. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS FOR NON-SINGAPOREANS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Acting Minister for Health whether it is possible for a non-Singaporean kidney patient to benefit from our organ donation programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> As donor kidneys will continue to be in short supply even after the new legislation is brought into operation, the cadaveric kidney transplant programme will be restricted to Singapore citizens and permanent residents only.
