Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Green Plan 2012 (SGP 2012) was launched in 2002 and sets out targets in six focus areas to ensure Singapore's environmental sustainability. These areas are clean air and climate change; water; waste management; public health; conserving nature; and international environmental relations.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2823<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a number of these targets&nbsp;has been met.&nbsp; In the area of water,&nbsp;our domestic water consumption per person per day in 2010 was 154 litres, which has surpassed the 2012 target of 155 litres.&nbsp; The SGP 2012 also set a target to increase the supply of water from non-conventional sources to at least 25% of the Singapore's water demand. We are now able to meet 30% of our water needs through NEWater production.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, good progress has been made in other areas.&nbsp; For waste management, we attain a 58% recycling rate in 2010.&nbsp; To achieve the 60% recycling target by 2012, my Ministry is now studying new waste-minimisation and recycling measures, taking into consideration the impact on businesses and households. The National Environment Agency (NEA) is also working closely with public waste collectors and grassroots organisations to encourage households to segregate waste for recycling.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of public health, we continue to enjoy a low incidence of vector-borne and food-borne diseases.&nbsp; Dengue has been kept on a control with an average annual incidence of about 5,800 cases between&nbsp;2006 and 2010, compared with some 14,000 cases reported in the 2005 epidemic.&nbsp; During the same period, we kept the average annual number of food poisoning outbreaks to about four per 1,000 food establishments licensed by NEA.&nbsp; On the international front, we are emerging as a leading regional centre in epidemiological surveillance and research on&nbsp;vector-borne diseases.&nbsp; NEA contributed towards a formulation of the World Health Organization's Dengue Strategic Plan for the Asia Pacific region in 2008.&nbsp; Sir, the plan is now being used by member countries to enhance their preparedness and response to dengue outbreaks and to <p align=left>Column: 2824<p>limit dengue epidemics through&nbsp;prevention and control.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's air quality remains good over the years with the PSI in the \"good\" range for at least 85% of&nbsp;the days in 2003 which meets the SGP 2012 target.&nbsp; Going forward, we will focus on reducing the PM 2.5 emissions from local sources such as transport as well as continue to engage neighbouring countries to mitigate and minimise transboundary haze pollutions.&nbsp; Despite Singapore's limited land area, we have managed to incorporate existing national areas into new developments so as to preserve our bio-diversity.&nbsp; For example, an existing natural mangrove along Sungei Punggol was integrated into the newly developed Sengkang Riverside Park. Under the ABC Waters programme, work is also underway at Bishan Park to develop a naturalised river that will meander through the park and that will in time enrich the bio-diversity of Bishan Park.&nbsp; As part of the SGP 2012 target to establish more parks and&nbsp;green&nbsp;linkages, NParks completed&nbsp;150 kilometres of park connectors as of November 2010.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the area of international environmental relations, we continue to meet the SGP 2012 targets of engaging our ASEAN neighbours and intensifying our international collaborations to tackle our environmental challenges.&nbsp; We are working closely with our ASEAN neighbours to overcome the transboundary haze pollution problem. The sub-regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution was a platform mooted by Singapore and established in 2006.&nbsp; Under the MSC framework, Indonesia and Singapore successfully embarked on the joint collaboration in Jambi province to implement action programmes to prevent and mitigate land and forest fires.&nbsp; Globally, Singapore is committed to international environmental efforts and our obligations are the multilateral environmental treaties, such as the United Nations Framework  <p align=left>Column: 2825<p> Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the&nbsp;Ozone Layer.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, looking ahead, there is a need to step up our efforts across all sectors &ndash; public, private and people &ndash; and engage all our partners and stakeholders to do more to ensure sustainable development.&nbsp; Higher economic and population growth will exert pressures on&nbsp;our limited land resources and our environmental quality in years to come.&nbsp; Global environmental challenges, such as climate change, are also key concerns on the international and national agenda.&nbsp; To ensure that Singapore continues to be a dynamic economy with a high quality living environment, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Sustainable Development (IMCSD) released the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint in April 2009 which establishes fresh targets in areas of resource efficiency and liveability to guide our efforts through&nbsp;2030.&nbsp; My Ministry and other agencies will continue to monitor progress and embark on the new initiatives laid out in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint to ensure that Singapore continues to develop sustainably in the decades beyond SGP 2012.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HUMAN ORGAN TRANSPLANT ACT--><p align=left>Column: 2825<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:HUMAN ORGAN TRANSPLANT ACT:::2828--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</B> The Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) was enacted in 1987.&nbsp; As at the end of last year,&nbsp;52 hearts, 144 livers, 1,080 kidneys and 1,181 corneas from deceased donors have been successfully transplanted.&nbsp; Many lives have been saved by HOTA.&nbsp; All Members of this House can claim some credit&nbsp;for this outcome&nbsp;by supporting this&nbsp;Bill. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vast majority of Singaporeans support organ donation.&nbsp; Less than 3% of the potential HOTA population, or about 77,000 people, have opted out.&nbsp; As we do not ask objectors to indicate their religion, I do not know how many are Muslims.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the question on applications by living donors for reimbursements of expenses, I do not have the data in the format as requested.&nbsp; But last year, there were 156 applications for living donor organ transplant.&nbsp; Of these, 142 were approved by the Transplant Ethics Committee (TEC).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of living donations are between family members and close relatives.&nbsp; In such cases, there is no reimbursement <I>per se</I> but the family will pool its resources to pay for all the medical expenses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the others, most recipients would pay for their donors&rsquo; hospitalisation directly to the hospitals.&nbsp; The size of the medical bills would depend on the type of transplant, the class of ward and the extent of subsidy enjoyed by the patients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the direct payment for hospitalisation expenses, there would be regular follow-up expenses for the donors.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2827<p>These follow-ups usually cost about $100 to $300 per consultation.&nbsp; They would be picked up by the recipients in most cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were a few cases where the recipients had also reimbursed their donors for loss of income.&nbsp; The average quantum of such reimbursement ranged from $500 to $750.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support needy Singaporean patients, the National Kidney Foundation has set up the Live Donor Support Fund.&nbsp; So far, it has received 11 applications and approved 10 of them.&nbsp; This is about one&nbsp;a month.&nbsp; The eleventh application is still under review.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Secondly,&nbsp;on the 14 that were not successful in the applications for living donors: what were the reasons?&nbsp; Thirdly, on the NKF Live Donors Support Fund.

Mr Speaker, thank you for allowing me to join in the Budget debate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the various dialogues that we have had over the last week and from the feedback received, the measures in the Budget that addressed the rising cost of living and the focus on inclusive growth are welcomed.&nbsp; Many share the view that Budget 2011 is good and generous and I would like to thank Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam for this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as with all Budgets, and in typical Singaporean style, I will say that there is always a desire for more and suggestion on areas for refinement,&nbsp;and I will touch on this in my speech.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Measures in the \"Grow and Share\" Package to address the rising cost of living and inflationary pressures faced by Singaporeans by helping to offset the<p align=left>Column: 2833<p>increase in household expenditure (especially for the lower and middle income) are indeed welcomed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to see&nbsp;the continued focus on building sustainable growth, capability of businesses and a skilled workforce with the emphasis to significantly increase real wage for Singaporeans by 30% in 10 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our discussions with businesses, many asked for the continuation of existing schemes for innovation and productivity, eg, the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme which was introduced last year.&nbsp; This will allow sufficient time for businesses to better understand the scheme and realise the impact of the efforts to raise productivity as this takes time.&nbsp; The feedback was that PIC, while useful, was complex.&nbsp; The request was for the scheme to be more flexible and easier for businesses to utilise, and to increase the scope of the scheme for greater impact for companies.&nbsp; It is heartening to see that the feedback was taken seriously.&nbsp; Generous enhancements have been made to PIC in this year's Budget.&nbsp; The enhancements to PIC allow for flexibilities in the categories of investment/activities which companies can enjoy tax deductions for investments that they make as well as the amount of tax deductions.&nbsp; This has been increased to 400% of expenditure up from the 250% for the first $400,000 spent on each qualifying activity.&nbsp; What this means is that for every dollar that a business spends on innovation/productivity, they are effectively getting 68 cents subsidy for that expenditure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is required now is to ensure that there is greater awareness amongst companies especially the smaller ones of schemes like PIC.&nbsp; This will ensure that they use the schemes to build and innovate and ensure that there is capability for their businesses for the long<p align=left>Column: 2834<p>term.&nbsp; I believe that awareness of this scheme is still not extensive enough.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Budget measures gear towards building inclusive growth and recognise that while sustained growth is key for Singapore, it is not sufficient.&nbsp; I was particularly pleased that the Minister reiterated the need for inclusive growth to enable all Singaporeans to be able to contribute and to share in Singapore's progress.&nbsp; I had mentioned previously in this House that we must ensure that all Singaporeans are able to aspire and can achieve better quality of lives for their families, regardless of individual circumstances/status. We must never reach a stage as a country where dreams and aspirations become out of reach of any sector in our society.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are several measures in the Budget to benefit all Singaporean households under the \"Grow and Share\" Package, eg, the Workfare Special Bonus, U-Save and Service and Conservancy Charges (S&amp;CC) rebates, personal income tax rebate of 20% capped at $2,000, to help offset inflation as well as permanent shifts in taxes (eg, the removal of the radio and television licence fees), subsidies and support given to benefit all, with continued emphasis on benefiting the lower-income more.&nbsp; The inclusion of benefits to the \"sandwiched\" middle-income group was well received.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was pleased to see the restructure of the personal income tax schedule to make it more progressive. Some may argue that this increases the complexity of the tax schedule.&nbsp; But this allows tax savings to be enjoyed at all income levels, and especially the middle income that form 60% of households.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must also make mention of the efforts made in this Budget to do away with the need for the application of some <p align=left>Column: 2835<p>of the rebates and top-ups, hence, making it easier for Singaporeans to benefit from these measures.&nbsp; Generous but fiscally prudent.&nbsp; I cannot reiterate how many times the&nbsp;Minister had reminded me of this prudent position.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The $4 billion will be put back into the past reserves, which were drawn earlier to fund the Jobs Credit Scheme and the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative under the Resilience Package.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past reserves had allowed us to act decisively during the economic crisis and it is fortunate that we are able to put back what was drawn earlier.&nbsp; This will ensure that we can continue to build on past reserves for future generations of Singaporeans to benefit from.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one-off income tax rebate for businesses and SME cash grant were appreciated by businesses.&nbsp; But for businesses, I must say that there were, however, mixed reactions to the Budget.&nbsp; Challenged with rising cost, the rise in foreign worker levy and the restoration of the employers' CPF contribution rate by 0.5% were met with some disappointment. While businesses recognise the need to innovate and increase productivity to reduce the dependency on low-wage foreign workers, and the need to restore CPF contributions to workers in better times, the short-term impact of these will result in the rise of the cost of doing businesses.&nbsp; Especially for current labour-intensive industries, it may not always be possible to realise productivity changes in the short term.&nbsp; So not only will they face a rise in costs, they may be challenged with filling jobs with the tight local labour market, and in some industries, as we all know, the unwillingness of Singaporeans to do these jobs.&nbsp; This may impact their ability to meet their operational requirements to keep their businesses and services running.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2836<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The impact of the foreign worker&nbsp;levy increase will be felt most by smaller businesses as they face greater challenge and competition in this tight labour market to attract and retain talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important that the impact of the effectiveness of this policy be monitored over time to check if it is achieving its original stated objectives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the several dialogues and feedback sessions that we&nbsp;had with business leaders, there were suggestions made for the refinement to the foreign worker levy scheme to support the longer-term objective of productivity and capability building of businesses.&nbsp;One suggestion is for the Government to roll out a tiered approach to the levy increases as it may not be easy for some companies to cope with the cost increase.&nbsp; Unlike larger companies, SMEs may not be able to absorb the increase in levy as easily.&nbsp; There was a concern that some small companies who are effective may be \"pushed out\" of the economy as a result of the inability to absorb the impact&nbsp;of the increase in cost in the short term.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another suggestion was for the Government to assist SMEs by allowing quarterly payments instead of monthly payments of levy charges. This will help the cash flow of SMEs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a suggestion to amend the levy such that it only impacts new recruitments and not the existing pool of foreign workers already hired and assigned to projects.&nbsp; This will help companies maintain stability and manage their current projected cost of operation. What companies require is clarity and certainty to allow them to plan their operations.&nbsp; The foreign worker levy changes will impact longer-term, multi-year projects that companies have already contracted for and are committed to.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another suggestion is to improve the image of some jobs to attract more locals.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2837<p>Reference was made to the skilled plumbers in Australia and skilled workers in Japan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also suggestion for the Government to apply the \"productivity rule\" to foreign talent and foreign workers.&nbsp; As the intent is to grow capability of companies and to ensure that when companies do hire foreign workers, they are productive.&nbsp; The suggestion is to consider allowing the levies collected to be pooled together and the funds tapped into for the training for&nbsp;foreign workers.&nbsp; This will help increase the effectiveness of the foreign labour and improve productivity of companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another suggestion is for the Government to take the lead on improving the productivity in the various industries and sectors.&nbsp; HDB's implementation of pre-cast is a very good example.&nbsp; This was shared with industry and drove innovation and productivity.&nbsp; HDB can also set the \"benchmark\" to drive productivity by requesting and awarding construction tenders to companies who innovate and use more productive methods.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were also other measures introduced to support enterprise growth. The $850 million Enterprise Development Fund (EDF) which will be available over the next five years, to be administered by SPRING and IE Singapore, will help high-growth industries in their overseas expansion.&nbsp; This is a substantial increase of about 45% from the previous five-year programme.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign tax credit pooling will simplify and reduce the taxation of foreign income. This will support companies that are globalising and earning a larger share of their income overseas.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Budget also touched on several initiatives to catalyse trade finance solutions to better support the needs of SMEs which will be announced later this <p align=left>Column: 2838<p>year.&nbsp; So aligned to this subject, I would like to discuss the Angel Fund investment deduction scheme that was introduced last year.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a welcome initiative for capital investment. The feedback, however,&nbsp;has been that the conditions make it difficult to qualify for the scheme. The application process for a maximum tax savings of $50,000 in two years is also an administrative challenge. The request is to simplify the angel investor tax deduction scheme and to increase the investment ceiling. This would make Singapore more attractive for high net worth investors&nbsp;to help build an ecosystem for SMEs to tap on funding required for growth.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are sentiments that this year&rsquo;s Budget is a budget for the SMEs&nbsp;and there were very little measures to assist larger businesses to enhance Singapore&rsquo;s international competitiveness as a location to do business. While I do agree that the measures&nbsp;of Budget 2011 will benefit smaller companies more, we must not forget that SMEs do form an important backbone of the economy and are key to the ecosystem for MNCs and larger companies to succeed in a market. In fact, many MNCs when making a decision to locate their operations in a country, do consider the capability of the local ecosystem of companies to support their businesses. However, I do agree with the point that was expressed that we need to continue to enhance Singapore's international competitiveness as we are an open market and we do have to compete for business with other markets, especially&nbsp;in Asia.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now like to touch on the measures in the Budget that look to strengthen our society.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Singapore&rsquo;s population ageing, it is imperative that the Budget measures  <p align=left>Column: 2839<p> address long-term elder care to provide our seniors with the best care possible to stay healthy and active in their retirement years. Apart from continuing the investments for new acute care hospitals, building on the long-term care sector to provide comprehensive and quality care for the elderly beyond institutional care is crucial.&nbsp; I am glad to see that the Budget measures will take a more integrated approach to build expertise and resources for care in the community and home-based care for the elderly and disabled. This will allow the elderly and the disabled to stay active and continue to be close to their families and friends.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The topping up of the ElderCare Fund to $2.5 million&nbsp;and the setting up of the new Community Silver Trust of $1 billion&nbsp;with matching grant for donations to the long-term care sector will also be important to help catalyse community support and the capability&nbsp;of the long-term care sector.&nbsp;The announcement of support programmes to provide additional support for low-income elderly people to improve their mobility and independence, for example, the assistive devices like wheelchairs and walking frames, are definitely&nbsp;welcomed.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Special Employment Credit (SEC) for workers currently covered by the Workfare Scheme will encourage employers to attract and keep older workers, and&nbsp;this will help our older workers who&nbsp;want to&nbsp;work and can work&nbsp;stay employed and active.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During our Budget dialogue with residents, the concern of medical cost was raised with emphasis for the elderly. Although many recognise that Budget 2011 is inclusive, with rising cost of living and the impact of inflation, retirees who do not participate in the economy and depend on their savings and CPF may not fully benefit from the Budget measures.<p align=left>Column: 2840<p>The question is how CPF and savings of retirees can be protected from inflation to meet the retirement needs of Singapore?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area that was highlighted during Budget discussions with residents that I&nbsp;had&nbsp;was housing. The feedback was that there should be more aggressive and out-of- the-box measures to address housing. Some felt that the 2011 Budget had not done enough for the sandwiched class in the area of housing. For example, the HDB income ceiling is still $8,000 for many years, yet salaries and other costs have increased. The suggestion is for the Government to consider raising the income ceiling for first-time buyers to purchase HDB flats. For some young graduates, even after working for a few years, they&nbsp;are unable to purchase a home with the high private property prices and are also unable to qualify to purchase an HDB flat. For many, this affects their decision to settle down and to start a family.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I end, I would like to ask a question on our overall fiscal position.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been several large pipeline projects announced by the Government to make Singapore&nbsp;a top quality home. For example, in the area of our transport infrastructure, there are projects like the&nbsp; Downtime Line (DTL) Project, Eastern Region Line (ERL), Thomson Line (TSL) North South Expressway (NSE) and the Marina Coastal Expressway.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ten&nbsp;billion dollars, as announced by the Minister,&nbsp;will&nbsp;be spent over the next 10 years for the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP) and the Home Improvement Programme (HIP), and the&nbsp;Remaking of our Heartlands (ROH) Programme&nbsp;in Hougang, East Coast and Jurong Lake.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of lifestyle, there are also several large projects like Gardens by the Bay, the Active Beautiful Clean (ABC) projects, National Arts Gallery, and the  <p align=left>Column: 2841<p> new commercial and lifestyle hubs&nbsp;in Jurong Lake District as well as Kallang River and&nbsp;Paya Lebar.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also several large projects for tertiary education, for example, the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), the Singapore Institute of Technology, the Polytechnic&nbsp;expansions, the Imperial College London-Nanyang Technological University Medical School, and the&nbsp;third ITE Regional Campus. There are also the Upgrading Programmes for Schools with the Primary Education Review and Implementation (PERI)&nbsp; and for the provision of the Indoor Sports Hall&nbsp;for Schools.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp;is&nbsp;higher expenditure on the ageing society including projects like the Jurong General Hospital, the enhancement&nbsp;of the quality of health services by increasing the number of doctors, nurses and allied health professionals and the upgrading of long-term care sector as announced in the Budget.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all these projects in the pipeline, what is the overall fiscal position versus the expenditure required? Will revenue be sufficient for the long term? Will there be a need to raise taxes? Will we expect to see the GST increased?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Budget 2011 is an inclusive Budget with measures that address the concerns of Singaporeans on the rising cost of living while making investments to strengthen our society and build capability to grow real income of Singaporeans. To be successful in achieving these objectives, there is a need for partnership with industries and Singaporeans. The Government cannot do this alone but will play a crucial enabling role.&nbsp; The Government must continue to provide the vision and the environment for Singaporeans to contribute and to share in the success of Singapore&rsquo;s progress.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with that, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 2842<p>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.38 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion as proposed by the Finance Minister.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, when I first conveyed news of the Budget goodies to 1,000 residents in Bukit Panjang, there was jubilation among my residents. Many were grateful that the Government has responded and addressed their key concerns of rising cost of living, affordable housing and children&rsquo;s education expenses. This year&rsquo;s $6.6 billion benefits for Singaporeans are indeed \"Pro Growth and Pro Singaporeans\". In Singapore, in particular, the \"Grow and Share\" package provides a comprehensive set of handouts and rebates to reward all Singaporeans for contributing to the 14.5% GDP growth in 2010.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singaporeans have shown resilience and are willing to take tough measures as proposed by the Government when faced with crisis. The success of our economic rebound last year is the outcome of the trust which Singaporeans place in our Government and the efforts of all Singaporeans working together. This strong partnership between Singaporeans and our Government is unique and not seen in many countries. It has proven to be effective in bringing peace, harmony and growth to our country, thus improving the lives of Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing incomes for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Sir, I fully support the strategy to grow the incomes of Singaporeans. But, how can we grow the incomes of Singaporeans when faced with an ageing workforce and intense global competition? First, Singapore must continue to provide a conducive business environment for all investments. Political stability, pro-business and sound Government policies must be in place in order to attract companies to invest and provide good <p align=left>Column: 2843<p>jobs for Singaporeans. Second, we need to grow our service industry to provide more jobs for an ageing workforce. Third, we need to increase our competitiveness to attract investments and secure business.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, political stability is the key success factor in ensuring foreign investments in Singapore. One good example is the construction of our&nbsp;two Integrated Resorts, namely, Marina Bay Sands and Resort World Sentosa. Since the operation of the Integrated Resorts, tourist arrivals and spending have increased drastically.&nbsp; Supporting industries for the Integrated Resorts have also seen an increase in demand for their products and services. Many local SMEs have benefited and have also offered more job opportunities for Singaporeans.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the measures to increase the productivity of our firms including raising the foreign worker levy but I am concerned about the impact of the levy increase on consumers and businesses. It is difficult to check and prevent profiteering. Some businesses may use the increase in levy as an excuse to increase prices, thus further increasing the cost of living.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theoretically, the increase in levy may force firms to innovate and increase productivity, but some business operations may have limited scope for productivity improvements. For example, how much productivity can you improve for hairdressing salons? Customers usually choose their hairdressers based on price, quality and service.&nbsp; As such, the increase in levy may not improve productivity&nbsp;drastically but will increase cost for consumers. There are many similar situations in the F&amp;B industries where the scope of productivity improvement may be limited. Yet, these businesses will have to pay higher foreign worker levy. I am <p align=left>Column: 2844<p> concerned that some firms may fail resulting in job losses.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would propose to the Finance Minister to refine the proposed increase of foreign worker levy. The increase could be industry specific depending on the urgency to improve productivity and competitiveness. For example, export-oriented manufacturing industries are facing intense global competition from low-cost production countries. Thus, they need to redesign their work processes and increase productivity to stay competitive.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in certain low-productivity industries such as the construction sector, we may need to identify the causes of low productivity before increasing the levy. Sir, low productivity in construction can be attributed to many factors such as designs which hinder construction productivity; or Government rules or bureaucracy which delays development and construction time; or poor planning of developers, consultants and contractors resulting in unnecessary delays or abortive works; or the lack of skills and low productivity of workers.&nbsp;Sir, unless we identify the root causes of low productivity in the various industries, the increase of foreign worker levy may not achieve its desired outcomes.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example is the F&amp;B industry where quality of service is more important than productivity <I>per se</I>. The F&amp;B industry also faces difficulty to attract Singaporean workers due to its shift work and long working hours. Therefore, it is more crucial for the industry to redesign its business operations to provide more job opportunities for skilled Singaporeans, especially older workers. To further upgrade the services of the F&amp;B industry, I would urge the Finance Minister to consider providing incentives for Singaporeans working in the industry to upgrade their quality of service.&nbsp; More training subsidies and grants should be given to Singaporeans who pursue skills<p align=left>Column: 2845<p>upgrading courses in service quality. This will provide more impetus to upgrade the service standards in the F&amp;B sector.&nbsp; In this regard, I would like to propose that the Government consider providing a \"Skills Upgrading Credit\" Scheme for all adult Singaporeans to continually enhance their employability, productivity and quality. The credit can be topped up from time to time depending on the budget surplus. It can be used by Singaporeans to attend WDA-accredited training courses. The credit scheme will also encourage greater ownership among Singaporeans to constantly update and upgrade themselves thus growing their incomes.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Green tax incentives.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one area which does not receive much attention in this year&rsquo;s Budget is tax incentives or measures to encourage green living. Besides the extension of the Green Vehicle Rebate Scheme for one year, there are no new initiatives to make Singapore an eco city. Sir, by 2030, about 80% of the global population will live in cities. Many mega cities are experiencing strains or failures in providing sustainable urban infrastructure. The impact of urban living and industrialisation has resulted in climate change and adverse impacts on the environment. As a city state with limited land area, it is crucial for Singapore to re-think our urban landscape development and the sustainability of our living environment.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We need to develop a holistic Eco Plan to rejuvenate our urban habitat and introduce eco-friendly measures to reduce pollution, increase energy efficiency and water conservation, reduce carbon emission, and encourage greater use of eco-friendly products and services among our people.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eco infrastructure.&nbsp;With an increasing population, Singapore must relook into the capacity of our infrastructure to support future population. The increase in human activities will intensify the density of our built environment and exert demands on<p align=left>Column: 2846<p>transportation, energy, water and waste disposal.&nbsp; Sir, many mega cities in Asia which experienced a sudden influx of people to the cities over the last 20 years are now facing enormous strains on housing, transport, waste disposal, pollution and many urban living problems.&nbsp; The existing infrastructure of these cities is not eco-friendly and is on the verge of failure.&nbsp; People living in these cities are prone to serious health problems and disease outbreaks.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would urge the Finance Minister to consider putting resources to enhance our infrastructure to be more eco-friendly.&nbsp; For example, we need to invest more on our public transport system to increase the connectivity of our MRT, LRT and bus services. More incentives should be provided to boost the competitiveness, productivity and innovation of our transport service providers to make public transport fees more affordable.&nbsp; Sir, many cities have started providing free public transport services so as to reduce traffic congestion and reduce vehicle emissions. I would suggest to the Finance Minister to consider providing free eco-friendly shuttle bus services linking neighbourhood centres, schools or shopping malls to housing estates.&nbsp; In addition, we can have a free shuttle bus linking up large shopping malls and nearby MRT stations in the city centre.&nbsp; This will encourage more people to use public transport especially during the weekends, thus reducing our carbon footprints.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the $4.7 million top-up fund for the School Advisory Committee (SAC) to help needy Singaporeans.&nbsp; But I would urge the Finance Minister to consider providing a yearly grant to SAC to provide school bus services in the morning for all students.&nbsp; School buses can pick students from the Residents' Committee (RC) centres, MRT stations or bus interchanges.&nbsp; Students can walk to their respective RC centres or go to the designated MRT or bus interchange to<p align=left>Column: 2847<p>take the school bus.&nbsp; In this way, students need not compete for public bus spaces with working adults during the morning peak hours.&nbsp; This will also reduce traffic congestion and carbon monoxide emission during the morning peak hours.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eco buildings.&nbsp; Sir, Singapore has made good progress in keeping our environment clean and green. We are ranked among the top green cities in Asia.&nbsp; However, there is still room for improvement to further improve the eco-friendliness of our built environment especially in older built-up areas like Chinatown, Little India, Queenstown and Shenton Way.&nbsp; There are many areas which require Government's support to go green.&nbsp; For example, many buildings in Singapore are not eco-friendly; many business processes are not eco-friendly; many homes are not eco-friendly, and there are not many people adopting eco-friendly lifestyles.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand that the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has a Green Mark Scheme for new buildings.&nbsp; More needs to be done to incentivise or encourage building owners of existing buildings to upgrade their buildings to be eco-friendly.&nbsp; Many existing buildings are still operating using inefficient energy installations and appliances, thus consuming lots of energy.&nbsp; Some buildings are poorly designed and thus increase their air-conditioning load while others use housekeeping processes which are not eco-friendly.&nbsp; Sir, I would urge the Finance Minister to consider providing tax incentives for building owners to upgrade their buildings to meet BCA's Green Mark Standard.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eco homes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as Singaporeans' standard of living increases, more homes will be installed with air-conditioning, water heating systems, refrigerators and many electrical appliances.&nbsp; This will increase energy consumption drastically<p align=left>Column: 2848<p>if nothing is done to encourage Singaporeans to adopt green measures at home.&nbsp; Instead of simply upgrading the electrical capacity of our buildings, we should encourage building users to reduce energy consumption. The Singapore Environment Council has developed energy and water efficiency labelling schemes. Unfortunately, the level of awareness and take-up rate is low. Many home users or decision makers are still purchasing inefficient electrical home appliances. Very often, more eco-friendly appliances (four ticks energy labelling) are more costly as compared to less eco-friendly ones. Thus, many home owners continue to purchase and use inefficient electrical appliances at home.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, consumer education on eco-friendly appliances is challenging as reflected in the low take-up rate of eco-friendly appliances at home. I would urge the Finance Minister to consider providing tax incentives or cash rebates to encourage home owners to replace or purchase eco-friendly home appliances (those with four ticks). The Government can provide a \"Green Credit\" Scheme to make every home eco-friendly in Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eco community.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to build an eco community, we need to set up proper infrastructure in the community.&nbsp; More green spaces or parks should be developed within the community.&nbsp; In this aspect, I would urge the Finance Minister to provide tax incentives for buildings which convert their rooftops into green spaces.&nbsp; As the majority of rooftop in Singapore is flat, there are lots of potential to make our roofs green.&nbsp; This will reduce the temperature in our built environment and reduce air-conditioning loads of our buildings, thus saving energy. &nbsp;In addition, we should build more green corridors within our built environment such as park connectors or community gardens.&nbsp; This will reduce the ambient temperature of our living environment and prevent adverse \"heat island\" effects.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2849<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides greening the built environment, we must also encourage Singaporeans to adopt Green living lifestyles.&nbsp; Simple eco-friendly living values like 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) should be inculcated among Singaporeans especially young children.&nbsp; I would urge the Finance Minister to consider setting up a \"Green Education Fund\" to spearhead environmental education for all Singaporeans on a sustained basis. We must adopt a more integrated approach towards building a green culture among Singaporeans.&nbsp; At present, the piecemeal and sporadic approach in environmental education lacks resources, consistency and sustainability.&nbsp; Government agencies, educational institutions and community-based organisations have limited funding to promote environmental education on a continuing basis.&nbsp; As such, we have yet to develop strong green values among Singaporeans.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.53 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, Budget 2011 is seen by many Singaporeans as a pre-election sweetener designed to win back the hearts and minds of people disempowered by 46 years of PAP rule.&nbsp; The Growth Policy adopted by the Government in recent years has left a hardworking nation disillusioned with its own identity, values and quality of life.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The global recovery has helped Singapore greatly.&nbsp; The Finance Minister has called 2010 an exceptional year.&nbsp; We ended the year with an exceptionally high GDP growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exceptional year also saw the number of locally born residents dipping to just 57.3% of the population.&nbsp; This has caused some of our young men to lament<p align=left>Column: 2850<p>that they no longer know what they are defending any more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The year also ended with aspiring home seekers grappling with a 14.1% rise in HDB prices and older Singaporeans worrying about retirement and rising medical costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking ahead, the new decade did not start off well either.&nbsp;Singaporean students attending our universities in 2011 will have to contend with a 4%-6% rise in tuition fees, all in the name of making the distinction between Singaporeans and permanent residents (PRs) sharper.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the economic outlook for Singapore is positive this year, almost every basic necessity is expected to cost more moving forward.&nbsp; From food to utilities, rental to childcare, lower- and middle-income Singaporeans will bear the brunt of the rising cost of living.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most Singaporeans are already resigned to paying more for public transport despite the unexpected move by the Public Transport Council to defer the 2011 Fare Review Exercise to the end of the year, after the election is over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The immediate threat that can derail the momentum of our economic growth is inflation.&nbsp; Singapore's inflation has just hit a two-year high in January.&nbsp; Food prices, healthcare and education costs have gone up by 2.8% to 3.8%.&nbsp; With oil prices hovering around the US$100 mark, Singaporeans can expect to pay more for many essential items and services this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I am of the view that the 2011 Budget should do more to tackle inflation from every possible angle as it is going to be a concern for everyone.&nbsp; There is a need for a concerted effort to address the rising cost of living at the fundamental level, which is to control the <p align=left>Column: 2851<p>price increase of essential items like food, transportation, education and healthcare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using rebates and subsidies to fight inflation can only ease the hardship in the interim.&nbsp; Permanent programmes like the Public Assistance (PA) scheme take a long time to catch up with inflation.&nbsp; The PA amount took&nbsp;two years to finally reach $400 a month in this Budget.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, I must state that it is a blessing to Singapore that many charitable organisations like the Lions Club and Food from the Heart are willing to help needy residents beyond what the Government is doing.&nbsp; However, inflation bites all sectors of the society.&nbsp; Middle-income families are hard-hit too.&nbsp; Many of them suffer in silence under a mountain of levies and price hikes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, without tackling the rising cost of living at the fundamental level, the election year's Growth Dividends would evaporate fast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The GST is at the centre of everything we consume.&nbsp; I urge the Government to seriously consider reducing the GST to help all sectors of the society cope with a projected slower growth and high inflation expected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Finance told this House in 2007 that the Government was shifting towards indirect taxation as a source of revenue when it raised GST from 5% to&nbsp;7% then.&nbsp; When GST was increased in 2003 and 2004, its percentage share of the total tax revenue went up to 14.9% in 2005.&nbsp; In this year's Budget, GST is projected to contribute 19.5% of the total tax revenue.&nbsp; As you can see, the GST&rsquo;s share of the tax revenue has gone up 30% since 2005.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Government is shifting from direct to indirect taxation, we should see the share of direct tax, specifically personal income tax, come down over<p align=left>Column: 2852<p>the years.&nbsp; In 2007, personal income tax constituted 15.5% of the total tax revenue.&nbsp; In the 2011 Budget estimates, this share is expected to go up to 16.1%.&nbsp; How can the Government justify the increase in GST when there is hardly any shift from direct to indirect taxation as a source of revenue?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the Workers' Party calls upon the Government to reduce the GST rate by two percentage points from the current 7%.&nbsp; Although this will shave $2.4 billion from the estimated receipt for FY 2011, if we discount the one-off election year's Growth Dividend of $1.55 billion, the shortfall in receipt is $0.85 billion.&nbsp; The shortfall in revenue can be balanced by trimming the budgets of some bloated Ministries. The shortfall may also be compensated by an increase in consumption stimulated by a lower GST rate and the expected increase in tourist receipts from the two fully operational IRs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers' Party has also called for a waiver of GST on basic necessities for a long time.&nbsp; I hope the Government will consider the proposal seriously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next,&nbsp;the foreign domestic worker (FDW) levy, like the radio and television licence fee, is fast losing its relevance too.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiring a domestic helper is no longer a luxury like in the past because of our changing lifestyle.&nbsp; Families with two working parents will need a helper to take care of their young children.&nbsp; Although subsidised infant care is an option, most parents would prefer a domestic helper to look after their babies under the supervision of their aged parents at home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, in our ageing society, domestic helpers can be trained to provide some basic care for our elderly and disabled.&nbsp; These helpers will complement our long-term care objectives and ease the demand for nursing homes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not aware of Singaporeans who want to work as stay-in domestic helpers.<p align=left>Column: 2853<p>Yet, such help is important to many working-class families.&nbsp; The FDW levy should be removed permanently.&nbsp; A saving of $170 to $265 a month will ease the financial burden of families with children and aged parents significantly.&nbsp; It will also somewhat mitigate the rising cost of employing a domestic helper since foreign governments supplying such labour are now demanding a higher salary for their citizens.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The removal of this levy may even nudge couples to think about having more babies since getting a domestic helper has become more affordable.&nbsp; &nbsp;The key thrust of this year&rsquo;s Budget is to strengthen our economy and society for the future.&nbsp; It promises to grow incomes&nbsp;of all Singaporeans by 30% in real terms over this decade.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of curiosity, I looked up the salaries in the Budget to estimate how much a 30% increase would work out for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; One group of employees did enjoy a 30% rise in salary last year.&nbsp; The estimated salary for Political Appointments for FY2010 was $58.3 million.&nbsp; This salary was revised to $75.7 million or about 30% more.&nbsp; This increase took only a year to materialise.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the incomes of Singaporeans do not grow 30% just like that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a lot harder for the salaries&nbsp;of Singaporeans to grow because foreign workers are always willing to work for less.&nbsp; I really hope to see us succeeding in growing the income of low-wage workers through the road of productivity growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Workers&rsquo; Party recognises the contributions of foreigners to the economic vibrancy of our nation and the need for foreign expertise in certain fields.&nbsp; However, the reason for admitting foreigners into our country should be to enhance the quality of life of Singaporeans.&nbsp; There must be sufficient<p align=left>Column: 2854<p>opportunities for Singaporeans to earn a decent living and to advance&nbsp;careers in our own country.&nbsp; Employers must give priority to hiring Singaporeans.&nbsp; Foreign workers should primarily be employed in positions Singaporeans are unable to fill.&nbsp; Until&nbsp;such thing happens, increasing the incomes of all Singaporeans by 30% is going to be a tough thing to do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have questioned the effectiveness of the foreign worker levy in controlling the number of foreign workers in Singapore.&nbsp; The latest increase in levy might dampen the demand for such workers in the short term but once the increase is priced into the foreign workers&rsquo; salaries, the situation is likely to return to <I>status quo</I>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The strong recovery has brought the unemployment rate down to the levels seen in early 2008, before the crisis, but no one can tell if Singaporeans have benefited much from the 14.5% GDP growth last year.&nbsp; Are there more Singaporeans employed now than in the pre-crisis days?&nbsp; Will Singaporeans get the lion&rsquo;s share of the 21,300 new skilled jobs mentioned by the Finance Minister when the investment projects are fully realised?&nbsp; What about the 35,000 Integrated Resort (IRs) jobs that the Prime Minister mentioned in this House in 2005?&nbsp; How many of these jobs went to Singaporeans now that the two IRs are fully operational?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Prime Minister has announced in 2009 and 2010 that the Government will make the distinction between Singaporeans and Permanent Residents sharper.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) does not believe that this distinction is necessary when it comes to reporting employment data.&nbsp; MOM has never made a distinction between Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents in its labour force report.&nbsp; Is the distinction important?&nbsp; The answer is \"yes\".&nbsp; It tells Singaporeans that<p align=left>Column: 2855<p>more jobs did go to them.&nbsp; It tells Singaporeans that distinction between PRs and them goes beyond a mere difference in fees charged for education and healthcare.&nbsp; It tells Singaporeans that jobs are indeed created and reserved for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure this House did not forget that Singaporeans did not even enjoy any significant fee advantage in education and healthcare when compared to PRs as recently as five years ago.&nbsp; So, let us&nbsp;make the distinction clearer.&nbsp; Let Singaporeans know more jobs did go to them in 2010 and more are reserved for them in the next decade.&nbsp; This is the true spirit of Singaporeans first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, the Budget this year has done one thing right.&nbsp; It has prudently put back into Past Reserves the $4 billion that the Government took in 2009.&nbsp; The Finance Minister has said no less than&nbsp;five times in the Budget Statement that the Government can do and will do more to help our society.&nbsp; Therefore, I urge the Government to do more to reduce the rising cost of living and the burden of supporting a family in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need to start working on reversing our low fertility rate urgently.&nbsp; This Budget has fallen short in encouraging couples to procreate.&nbsp; Increasing our fertility rate has to remain&nbsp;a top priority despite the fact that most of the efforts initiated by the Government have failed so far.&nbsp; Taking the easy way out to boost our population by importing foreigners is counter-productive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as this may be one of the last sittings of Parliament before it is dissolved, I wish all Singaporeans well.&nbsp; I also wish to see a first-world parliament in the making when we reconvene in this House after the coming General Election.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Mildred Tan (Nominated Member)--><p align=left>Column: 2856<p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.06 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Mildred Tan (Nominated Member):</B> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to thank the Minister for Finance for once again encouraging productivity and innovation in companies.&nbsp; Having studied and worked with companies in developed countries, I know these two activities will make a great difference to the Singapore economy.&nbsp; The enhancements to the Productivity and Innovation Credit scheme is also very generous and recognises the huge capital and training outlays that companies face in automating and improving their business processes and operations.&nbsp; These tax credits would help level the difference between the increase in labour costs and capital expenditure and will encourage businesses to offset increasing labour costs by investing in capital and training.&nbsp; Quantitatively, every dollar spent on qualifying expenditure, businesses could get up to 68 cents in tax savings through the PIC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I do feel there is still much to be done to increase innovation and productivity activities.&nbsp; We need to create a buzz to get people excited.&nbsp; There seems to be some difficulty pinning down exactly what constitutes innovation and productivity activities.&nbsp; I would like to point out three paradoxes in our current thinking and how they can be resolved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we plan for a \"flash in the pan\"?&nbsp; First, what counts as productivity and innovation?&nbsp; There is a general notion that it is anything that allows us to do more with less.&nbsp; This is not a bad rule of thumb.&nbsp; For operational purposes, Sir, I note that there is an implicit definition in the qualifying activities that are funded by the Productivity and Innovation Credit.&nbsp; Buying computers, sending people for training, hiring designers, generally buying or registering&nbsp;intellectual property are <p align=left>Column: 2857<p>considered activities that add to productivity and innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, there&nbsp;are&nbsp;some caveats&nbsp;which we ought to be mindful of.&nbsp; I would like to point out&nbsp;that merely buying computers and investing in IT is not an assurance of increased productivity.&nbsp; Much depends on its application and on people using and exploiting technology to generate efficiencies or create new knowledge.&nbsp; Therefore, investing in technology and buying a new IT system must include the impetus to want to change, to become better, to see the difference and impact on the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end, we ought to have some accountability on why the investment is important and when it becomes a business imperative.&nbsp; If not, the investment in IT system becomes a \"flash in the pan\", no different from buying the latest mobile phone or the latest technology equipment in town.&nbsp; We must inculcate the sense of ownership and pride to always want to do better such that productivity becomes a way of life and not just a project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like to say a little about innovation.&nbsp; What counts as innovation?&nbsp; When we speak of innovation, is it just a great idea, doing things differently that brings an enhanced value or it is re-thinking a revolution or scientific breakthrough?&nbsp; It has been very interesting and insightful for me being in Parliament.&nbsp; Speaking from someone who is on the outside in the private sector looking in, I am of the view that there are many innovations in the public sector in Singapore.&nbsp; In recent years, many of these have made a great difference to the lives of Singaporeans but few talk about.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My work as Head of ASEAN Advisory Services for my firm takes me to many countries, both regionally and globally.&nbsp; Often, as soon as they know I am from Singapore, they will say two things:&nbsp; \"Ah, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, you have a very clever government, we could use them here, they have many ideas.\"&nbsp; I am often asked <p align=left>Column: 2858<p>about the different Government initiatives such as Cut Waste campaign to the introduction of the Productivity and Innovation Credits last year.&nbsp; Most companies and governments want to emulate what we take for granted.&nbsp; We are being watched for our innovativeness but, yet, we do not get excited about what happens right here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take, for example, one of my favourite examples of ABC Water.&nbsp; There is a movement to make water a part of Singaporeans' lives, to open up the catchment areas, to make one piece of land serve different uses.&nbsp; In the Alexandra area, the canals still flow, the water still drains and now people see it as \"waterside\" living rather \"drainside\" living.&nbsp; We did&nbsp;not use more land or more money &ndash;&nbsp;okay, perhaps a little more money to landscape the place &ndash;&nbsp;but the economic value derived from the same canal has increased.&nbsp; The Park Connector is described by many as awesome.&nbsp; We have increased the economic value of land and properties in the&nbsp;surrounding area.&nbsp; We have increased the community pride and enhanced the social value in these places.&nbsp; This is, however, not a \"flash in the pan\".&nbsp; It is a result of collaboration of different parties.&nbsp; It is a result of \"River Clean Up\" in the 1970s that led to cleaner water bodies.&nbsp; It is a result of National Parks collaborating and coming up with landscaping.&nbsp; It is a result of the Ministry of National Development (MND) and URA for their master-planning and, of course, with the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources and PUB, which take care of water.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, this is truly an example of innovative collaboration. &nbsp;Taken singly, these different things&nbsp;undertaken by the Government departments and&nbsp;agencies are just annual workplan projects.&nbsp; But taken collectively today, they represent a great urban innovation.&nbsp; But how do we plan for a \"flash in the pan\"?&nbsp; We need&nbsp;to regard our day-to-day work as part of a<p align=left>Column: 2859<p>larger whole, to be conscious that innovation&nbsp;is not something that we get by thinking and reflecting but having a vision for tomorrow.&nbsp; Like&nbsp;the bricklayer laying a brick one day at&nbsp;a time to the bricklayer who is laying one brick at a time to build a world-famous cathedral.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge us all to change the way we regard innovation as something&nbsp;that comes from reflecting, dreaming and thinking to the path of collaboration, to be excited that how innovation&nbsp;have effected so many transformations right before our very eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how do we invest in people who may or may not stay?&nbsp; When we speak of training and innovation, we usually&nbsp;think in terms of Singaporeans or PRs.&nbsp; I urge more companies not to invest just in foreign talent at executive and managerial levels but also in foreign workers in our construction workers, in our shipyard workers and our service staff.&nbsp; I think it is useful to note that tax deductions for training expenditure under PIC applies to training for all workers, not just local workers.&nbsp; This is because they, too, contribute to our economy and it is often in these areas that there are many low-hanging fruits.&nbsp; We should see foreign workers as not&nbsp;a liability but&nbsp;an asset. Take pains to identify those among them who will be able to contribute effectively to our economy.&nbsp; Companies should take the lead in identifying these workers and find ways to extend their work contracts. So should we invest in people who may or may not stay?&nbsp; I say invest anyway and find ways to make them stay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, I have a suggestion for the&nbsp;PIC scheme.&nbsp; The deductions have a positive cashflow only in the Year of&nbsp;Assessment and not in the year in which expenses are incurred.&nbsp; This delay in receiving&nbsp;the benefits may dilute the effectiveness of the scheme.&nbsp; Businesses, especially SMEs, <p align=left>Column: 2860<p>will need cash&nbsp;upfront to invest in technology and training.&nbsp; My suggestion&nbsp;would be for the Government&nbsp;to allow&nbsp;SMEs&nbsp;with qualifying expenditure this year to defer a portion of their liability in the Year of Assessment&nbsp;2011.&nbsp; This&nbsp;deferred portion would be equivalent to the amount of tax they would&nbsp;save or cash payout receivable in Year of Assessment 2012.&nbsp; The&nbsp;deferral could be spread over instalments payable each year until Year of Assessment 2015.&nbsp; This would encourage companies to start planning and investing immediately to enjoy an early cashflow benefit.&nbsp; It&nbsp;would also provide the Government with earlier indicators as to the take-up rate of the scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everybody gains when productivity rises but how do we split the gains?&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to share two success stories about companies who have take up the Government's call on productivity and innovation and have tapped on Government grants.&nbsp; The first is Sheng Siong Supermarket.&nbsp; The work processes in the seafood division rely almost entirely on manual labour and most of their transactions done on paper with more than a hundred operational sales staff.&nbsp; With rising labour costs, Sheng Siong decided to automate the processes.&nbsp; Last year, the company embarked on a project to implement scaleable technology where wireless transmission of stock data captured on its weighing scales from procurement to distribution and sales directly to their Enterprise Resource Planning system.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

This shows us how productivity is not simply replacing manpower with&nbsp;machines.&nbsp; It is not a matter of cost cutting.&nbsp; Productivity is about how output can be optimised and maximised, and how well-designed processes can help the company grow.</p><p align=left>Column: 2861<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second example is Red Lips Food.&nbsp; This is a local manufacturing, specialising in production of the traditional Peranakan snack <I>kueh pie tee</I>.&nbsp; In the past, <I>kueh pie tee</I> cups have a shelf life of only one month.&nbsp; Red Lips approached Food Innovation Resource Centre based in Singapore Polytechnic and supported by SPRINGS to conduct a shelf life extension study on <I>kueh pie tee</I> cups using packaging technology.&nbsp; A solution comprising the use of improved packaging and optimal glazes combination was recommended.&nbsp; The shelf life of these <I>kueh pie tee</I> cups is today more than six months.&nbsp; The success of this project enables Red Lips to explore uses of the product and to target export markets for their <I>kueh pie tee</I> cups.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both these cases show that there is a lot which productivity and innovation can be done to improve things on the ground.&nbsp; But yet more can be done.&nbsp; This brings me to a serious point about sharing the gains of productivity.&nbsp; How does higher productivity translate to higher real incomes?&nbsp; Would the benefits of productivity be passed on to consumers with lower prices?&nbsp; Or retained by companies to recover their capital expenditure instead of being passed to staff?&nbsp; This is something for the tripartite team of unions, Government and businesses who will work together.&nbsp; But I encourage the tripartite committee to consider gain-sharing where there is something for everyone.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have shown that the three paradoxes can all be fairly and easily resolved through a paradigm shift on how we think of productivity through a new approach for foreign workers through open, committed sharing of productivity gains.&nbsp; We need to get people excited and we need to instil the pride that productivity and innovation can be a way of life here.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I end with some observations about business costs in general.<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2862<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rising costs of rents.&nbsp; Rents form a large part of business expenses&nbsp;and soaring rents is creating a heavier burden.&nbsp; One way which the Government could help businesses is to allow companies to have an extra tax deduction on the cost of relocating operations to cheaper leases.&nbsp; These costs would include logistics costs, professional fees in drafting lease agreements and stamp duties.&nbsp; This would reduce transaction costs and may encourage businesses to search for cheaper locations.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rising costs of living.&nbsp; If inflation is expected to remain above 3% annually for the next few years, I think we need to address the potential erosion of savings, especially CPF savings, now.&nbsp; I know that we have current plans to ensure that real income rises.&nbsp; At the same time, many Singaporeans count on this for their retirement.&nbsp; These sums need to be protected against inflation and our ability to meet the rising costs of living expenses in the long term.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, I would like to touch on one special area and that is&nbsp;of healthcare&nbsp;&ndash; about caring for our elderly and caring for those who are unable to look after themselves, for example, the mentally ill. &nbsp;Sir, I think it is vitally important for us to strengthen our home nursing or caregivers&rsquo; support, especially to home-care for the elderly or mental health patients or even terminally ill patients.&nbsp; Often we think of healthcare in hospitals and step-down care but I think more can be done for home-care support and to recognise the help needed by those at home.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to thank the Government, in particular, for the $1 billion for the new Matching Community Silver Trust.&nbsp;This matching Government grant set up for donations to the long-term care sector will help the sector be more attractive to private funding and donations.&nbsp; I would<p align=left>Column: 2863<p>like to urge more companies and private individuals to step forward so that our elderly &ndash; especially our needy elderly &ndash; will be assured of a better tomorrow.&nbsp; Like the time-tested adage \"a little drop of water makes a mighty ocean\", I am hoping that no matter how small a donation&nbsp;may be, it will make a difference to someone's life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I congratulate the Finance Minister on a fine Budget and I wish him and his team every success in its implementation.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This is what the Singapore Government ought to do and a step in the right direction for Singapore to become a more inclusive society.<p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are people who speculate that this is an election Budget to reward and please the voters, so that they will support and vote for the PAP in the General Election.&nbsp; Such thinking is not desirable.&nbsp; In my view, every Budget should be an election Budget because the Government should be continually assessed on doing the right thing for&nbsp;the people.&nbsp; Singaporeans want to know how the Government helps them deal with crises, overcomes challenges, plans for the future and to take care of the interests of as many Singaporeans as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will remember the 2009 Budget when the Government introduced generous schemes such as Jobs Credit and SPUR.&nbsp; The purpose was definitely not<p align=left>Column: 2864<p>to please voters and prepare for a General Election but to preserve the jobs of Singaporeans!&nbsp; If the objective of this year's Budget is to reward or please voters, the Government would not return $4 billion to our reserves but simply use this money to dish out more goodies to buy votes.&nbsp; Our Government is a prudent and frugal government.&nbsp; It concerns itself with the long-term viability of the country.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just now, Hougang MP Low Thia Khiang said that his responsibility is to criticise the Government because he is the Secretary General of the Workers' Party.&nbsp; If he praises the PAP Government, he does not deserve to be the Leader of the Opposition. Despite criticism from the Opposition, this Budget has received strong support, according to media reports.&nbsp; Mr Low spoke just now as if he were at a mass election rally telling people how to improve their livelihood in the next few years.&nbsp; In reality, however, people know in their hearts if their livelihood has improved or not.&nbsp; We should let Singaporeans decide what kind of party they want.&nbsp; Can such a party form a good government to provide a better future for us and our children?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our reserves is an important cornerstone of this concept and replenishing it means that the Government is safeguarding the future of our country.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget is a good Budget. It is comprehensive and it covers most of the critical issues that are of concern to the majority of Singaporeans. I would like to suggest three key areas which I think the Government should put in more resources.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, help young couples own a house as soon as possible.&nbsp; On top of housing grants, I urge the Government to consider giving newly married couples priority to select HDB flats that they would like to buy as their matrimonial home.&nbsp; We must help young Singaporeans to get married<p align=left>Column: 2865<p>as soon as possible and getting them a flat would help fulfil this objective.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, help young couples to have children as soon as possible.&nbsp; Raising a child in Singapore is an expensive affair because every parent wants the best for their children.&nbsp; When I speak to young couples, they have three key concerns in raising a child:&nbsp; (i) cost of infant care and mother's recuperation after delivery. The medical expenses can be quite high, often over $20,000;&nbsp; (ii) cost of a good childcare centre;&nbsp; (iii) transport between childcare centre and caregiver's home.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore like to urge the Government to be more decisive in helping young couples have babies.&nbsp; Give direct cash incentives to the parents for the first two to three children.&nbsp; Give each child $20,000 to be matched by $5,000 from the parents.&nbsp; Allow the parents to spend it freely on the child's education.&nbsp; A few days ago, I heard Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng say he did not agree with cash incentives.&nbsp; I respect his analysis and views. The problem young couples are facing is that they have to wait two to five years to get their flat after the marriage registration.&nbsp; My views is that cash incentive is the most effective way.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Giving more resources to the&nbsp;Ministry of Home Affairs,&nbsp;I note an increase of 4.7% from 2010 in the budget for Security and External Relations, while the budget for Home Affairs increased 2.9%.&nbsp; Homes Affairs constitute 20.8% of the budget for this sector with the majority going to Defence.&nbsp; I am not saying Defence is not important.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two reasons why I support higher spending by Home Affairs.&nbsp; Firstly, the threat of terrorism is a real and present danger.&nbsp; Any lapse in vigilance could result in economic and social damage that could take away years of <p align=left>Column: 2866<p>growth.&nbsp; A bombing in CBD could mean Singapore ceases to function as an economic centre.&nbsp; So, while we pay attention to Defence, it is also important to support Home Affairs.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, youth problems and gang fights can be better addressed.&nbsp; I remember when I was a young man, I was terrified of policemen.&nbsp; Not because I had done something wrong, but because of their sense of authority.&nbsp; I feel young people nowadays have less respect for policemen from my casual observations in coffeeshops.&nbsp; If we can attract higher quality policemen, I think we can do better to instil awe and control gang activities.&nbsp; Gang activities in the 1950s were far worse than today but after 20 years, they have not died out.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's Budget is a generous Budget but also a prudent Budget.&nbsp; It will boost household incomes and reduce income inequality while also laying the foundation for longer-term innovation and reducing our reliance on foreign workers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any country, if the Opposition says good things about the ruling party, then do we still need an Opposition?&nbsp; We must believe in the wisdom of the Singapore people.&nbsp; We experienced the most difficult time after our separation from Malaysia, we have overcome many hurdles.&nbsp; Older Singaporeans all know that PAP has never deceived them.&nbsp; For the new generation, we must use new wisdom and the Internet to lead them.&nbsp; In the end, all we want is, first, a&nbsp;better quality of life; and, second, a better future for the next generation.&nbsp; Singaporeans will see if you can deliver what you have promised.&nbsp; They will not believe words alone.&nbsp; When I go to the coffeeshop, people ask me for&nbsp;the Toto or 4-D numbers.&nbsp; Can I give you the numbers?&nbsp; I give you 1, 2, 3, 4 for 4-D.&nbsp; I can just say that but the numbers will not be the winning numbers.&nbsp; I urge Singaporeans to think carefully after <p align=left>Column: 2867<p>listening to a party's speech: can they really deliver? The party you elect should be&nbsp;the one who can truly fulfil your aspirations.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support this Budget and I will do my best to bring the Government's message to the people.<br></p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In many countries, prudence has translated into austerity drives, with severe belt tightening as governments try to rein in their expenditures in order to balance their budgets, even in critical areas such as education and healthcare, at a time when most people are still suffering from job losses and pay cuts arising from the 2009 crisis. In the United Kingdom, for instance, thousands of workers in the teaching and healthcare sectors may lose their jobs because of budget cuts and, obviously, as Members know, there is a big conflict now between the labour movement and the UK government.&nbsp; So, this is not a Budget to be highly dismissed as an election budget or gimmicks to win votes, as suggested by hon. Member of Parliament, Mr Low Thia Khiang.&nbsp; But I am also glad to hear that he also says that this is a prudent Budget because $4 billion is now being put back into our reserves that were drawn down last year.&nbsp;If the Government has not managed the economy well and there is no surplus, there is nothing to share even if the Government wants to do so and&nbsp;we will&nbsp;end up&nbsp;like many countries with severe cutbacks in expenditures causing tremendous hardship to our people.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our case, the Government could even return the $4 billion which was drawn down&nbsp;from our reserves last year, and expenditure in critical areas such as education has increased, and there is even a $3.2 billion Grow and Share package to share with Singaporeans and provide some relief from the rising cost of living. This is impressive, and I have received positive feedback from trade unionists and workers who also strongly applaud the 0.5% restoration to the employers' CPF <p align=left>Column: 2870<p>contribution rate and the Workfare Special Bonus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in particular, I like the focus on creating job opportunities for older workers, women and PMETs.&nbsp; For older workers, the special employment credits plus the Workfare Special Bonus would create more employment opportunities for them. Our older workers, too, would find it worthwhile to continue working and strengthen their retirement nest egg, as a recent global survey indicated that quite a large number of older Singaporeans had indicated that they would prefer to retire at 60 years of age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also&nbsp;very heartened by the increase in the household income ceiling to $3,500 for low-income families to enjoy higher KiFAS and CFAC subsidies, when putting their children in childcare centres or kindergartens. I have raised this issue a number of times in this House, most recently at last month's Parliament sitting, as the existing ceiling of $1,800 is too low and unrealistic. The higher ceiling would encourage more mothers to go out to work, thus helping to strengthen low-income households.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, additionally, the measures to support PMETS, through more training programmes and higher subsidies for those taking part-time diploma and degree programmes, would help them to upgrade and remain employable, particularly for the older PMETS who find it difficult to get jobs after retrenchment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the increase in the foreign worker levy has raised concerns among employers. The increase is painful, but necessary if we want productivity and incomes to go up, and I am glad that the Government has given a clear signal that the levy will no longer be used as a tool to adjust business costs in bad times.&nbsp; In my view, this is the right direction as a yo-yo foreign worker levy policy which changes with the economic cycles will weaken <p align=left>Column: 2871<p>employers' resolve and undermine our efforts. We create so many jobs every year, but creating jobs alone is not sufficient. We have to ensure that these are decent jobs that pay decent wages for people to survive and raise their families. People must feel that there is pride in working and that their efforts will be rewarded. Instead of viewing this negatively, I urge employers to make every effort to employ older workers and women, and redesign jobs to enhance the productivity of our low-income workers. It is easy to blame Singaporeans as being fussy,&nbsp;not prepared to do dirty work and not prepared to work long hours.&nbsp; But that is telling only one side of the story;&nbsp;it is not telling the whole story.&nbsp; There is a real need for companies to make more efforts to improve the quality of jobs and improve wages for low-paying jobs so as to attract and retain more Singaporeans.&nbsp; Companies should make better use of the various incentives given under this Budget, such as the higher Innovation and Productivity Credits and the additional $1 billion injected into the National Productivity Fund (NPF), in order to invest in automation, improve processes and upskill workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I&nbsp;feel that there is also a misperception over the meaning of productivity improvements. The perception happens to be that&nbsp;with the levy increase, there will be a need for more Singaporeans to replace the jobs of foreign workers.&nbsp; But this is obviously not the intention of productivity improvements.&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective is to help companies improve their productivity by increasing their output of&nbsp;producing the same output with fewer workers, especially foreign workers.&nbsp; Somehow, this message is not well understood.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the case of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), we&nbsp;have been working with about 200 companies under <p align=left>Column: 2872<p>the Inclusive Growth Programme (IGP) to help companies tap into the National Product Fund (NPF)&nbsp;and boost their productivity.&nbsp; The IGP programme covers many sectors of the economy where low-wage workers are found.&nbsp; Through the IGP programme, workers are upskilled, processes upgraded, costs reduced and there is greater&nbsp;use of automation resulting in productivity increases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the criteria under the IGP for drawing down on this fund is the requirement that any productivity gains must be shared with workers.&nbsp; I think this is one of the concerns, a point that has been raised by many Members who spoke before me.&nbsp; Workers have had their basic wages increased or received additional bonuses through productivity gain sharing.&nbsp; This is the experience that&nbsp;NTUC has had with 200 companies under the IGP.&nbsp; This is a win-win approach and shows that productivity improvements are doable.&nbsp; Sir, having said a lot of good things about the Budget, there are a couple of points that I wish to raise and I hope the Ministry would take these into consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, Sir, on the&nbsp;Special Employment Credits.&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry of Finance to make this scheme a permanent measure instead of a one-off scheme, as our population is ageing rapidly, and the challenge of keeping older workers employed will not go away after three years, and it will become even more pressing.&nbsp; Some countries, too, have such schemes which, to my knowledge, are long term and not just temporary.&nbsp; My concern is that giving employment credits for only three years would cause some employers to terminate the older workers after the three-year period is over when their wage cost goes up again.&nbsp; In other words, we are encouraging employers to look upon older workers as a temporary pool of workers instead of incentivising them to employ them for longer periods.&nbsp; So I urge the Ministry for Finance to <p align=left>Column: 2873<p>rethink the Ministry's position on this issue and make the Employment Credits a permanent scheme and, therefore, issue a very strong signal to employers that it wants to support measures to make our older workers a lot more&nbsp;employable.&nbsp; I believe, Sir, that there is no loss to the Government by making this scheme permanent.&nbsp; On the other hand, by enabling older workers to stay employed, our economy will benefit from less reliance on foreign workers and greater self-reliance among the elderly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next point, Sir, is on long-term care and I would like to talk about the review of the&nbsp;Foreign Maid Levy Relief.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the&nbsp;Budget's focus on providing quality long-term care is timely and necessary because, from now until 2030, the number of residents aged 65 years and above will increase from 300,000 to 900,000.&nbsp; By then,&nbsp;one out of every&nbsp;five residents will be a senior.&nbsp; Hence, topping up Medisave and Medifund, and allocating $1 billion to the Community Silver Trust are moves in the right direction, showing the Government's resolve to provide quality long-term care for our elderly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, while on the one hand the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has injected a big amount into long-term care, it has continued to deny support for caregivers of the elderly sick who are single and who are doing their best to care for their parents at home, instead of sending them to the nursing homes or the community hospitals which would put a bigger strain on the Government's healthcare budget.&nbsp; I am referring here to the Foreign Maid Levy Relief, which is currently not applicable to singles. Under this Relief Scheme, only married women are eligible.&nbsp; So, a married woman who has grown up children but who need help to take care of her elderly sick parents can get this relief, which amounts to twice the foreign domestic worker levy paid in the previous year.&nbsp; But, the poor single woman struggling on her own to take care of her<p align=left>Column: 2874<p>sick, elderly parents and needs just as much, if not more support, as she does not have a husband to support her, is not eligible for this relief.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is inconsistent and unfairly penalises singles who are filial and want to take care of their elderly parents at home.&nbsp; It is also contradictory to our healthcare policy, which is to encourage people to take care of their aged sick at home.&nbsp; I understand that the current objective of the Foreign Maid Levy Relief Scheme is to promote procreation but, surely, this policy is not cast in stone and should be reviewed to take into account changing demographic needs.&nbsp; I urge the Minister&nbsp;to extend this relief to singles, so that Government can achieve two policy objectives &ndash; promote procreation and encourage care for the elderly at home.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third point, Sir, is on&nbsp;helping the poor and low income, and the widening income gap.&nbsp; Sir, we can all agree that there are no magic bullets providing quick solutions to challenges such as the widening income gap, an ageing population and the skills gap, which are often intertwined, and which confront not only Singapore but the whole world as well.&nbsp; Also, when we talk of the low-income or the bottom 20th percentile, I suspect that this is probably not a stagnant group because as their incomes improve through skills upgrading or social mobility through better education for their children, they would move up to the higher-income level.&nbsp; However, we cannot also deny the fact that with an ageing population there might well be a segment within this group that could be stuck&nbsp;because they are retiree households with no income or households whose members suffer from physical or mental disabilities, for instance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They may or may not have families but their families, too, are struggling to meet their own needs. We certainly need more analysis and information about our <p align=left>Column: 2875<p>low-income families but their immediate concerns are how to survive from day to day. &nbsp;This is the group that would also be the worst affected by the higher cost of living, and who would not qualify for Public Assistance.&nbsp; I think this group needs longer-term support, not just one off measures provided under this Budget, and I would certainly hope to hear some clarifications or comments from the Minister on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that our strong economic growth&nbsp;has not come about by chance.&nbsp; It was due to careful planning and management, shrewd and competence stewardship of our economy which has&nbsp;seen us enjoying one of the lowest unemployment rates in the world,&nbsp;an important pre-requisite to address this issue of inflation.&nbsp; In some countries, including developed ones, unemployment has reached very high levels, especially among the young.&nbsp; There is&nbsp;great restlessness and governments have little means and resources to assist their affected citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that we, in the years ahead, will be facing a much more challenging environment.&nbsp; The global economic&nbsp;situation, including the global political situation, has also become a lot more uncertain&nbsp;and we certainly need to have a Government that is strong and&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;provide strong stewardship of our economy.&nbsp; And most certainly, this is a Budget, in my view, that will build strongly on our sound fundamentals and help us through the challenging years ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on this note, I support the Budget.&nbsp;Let me just say a few words in Malay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2011/20110228/20110228VS_163020.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*</I>.]&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I welcome this year's Budget, which is generous in nature but also well <p align=left>Column: 2876<p>structured so that there is still prudence in spending.&nbsp; It is not easy since not many countries can do it.&nbsp; As part of their austerity efforts, many countries are forced to sacrifice many important areas, like education and healthcare, although by right both should receive more focus so as to help many people who were affected by the economic crisis in 2009.&nbsp; Our Budget not only emphasises these two areas but also manages to return $4 billion to the national reserve that was drawn out last year.&nbsp; Even so, the Government is able to set aside a further $3.2 billion to stimulate the economy and help those affected.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, this Budget contains many good policies and it is generally inclusive in nature by ensuring that each citizen reaps the benefits from the economic recovery, while giving assistance and benefits to individuals from the low-income families to the middle income, students, women, senior citizens and the PMETs who will all face the inflation rate that is said to be between 3% and 4% this year.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I really support the aspect where there is an emphasis on education and increasing job opportunities for elderly workers, women and the PMET group. This shows that while we try to reduce the current burden, like the increasing cost of living, we must still invest diligently to generate long-term growth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we must ensure that the national economy stay competitive and for that, the investment in our workers is critical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These steps, I feel, will help us overcome the income gap problem.&nbsp; If each employee works hard, willing to work longer and competitively, and if more than one family member brings income home for the whole family, they can continue to get a better salary and their cost of living will be more affordable.</p><p align=left>Column: 2877<p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time, there should be more support towards efforts to restructure the nation's economy in order to achieve higher productivity.&nbsp; This burden should not be solely carried by the workers as this is a combined responsibility.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, therefore, I feel that the incentive schemes for workers will not succeed if employers do not seize the benefits from other incentive schemes like the higher Productivity and Innovation Credit Scheme and the additional $1 billion towards the National Productivity Fund to encourage automation and improve work processes and skills training for workers.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, even though many agree that this Budget contains many goodies, and it has a positive message to encourage and increase productivity and develop the economy for the long term, allow me to emphasise this&nbsp;&ndash; we must need to continue monitoring so that inflationary pressures and the rise in cost of living will not be too burdensome or fall beyond the affordability of low-wage workers and the poor.&nbsp; At the same time, each worker must be encouraged to continue working and seize opportunities to upgrade themselves so that they can obtain better pay in order for us to progress together.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Budget will open up more room in education for our students.&nbsp; I urge our community, especially parents and students, to fully understand the opportunities provided and use it as best as possible.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Sir, I support this year's Budget.</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3007-3010.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I thought I was participating in&nbsp;an election rally just now.&nbsp; Budget 2011 is a good Budget.&nbsp; You can call it whatever name, whether this is a pre-election Budget, it is indeed a generous Budget.&nbsp; It comes at a time when most governments are struggling&nbsp;with reducing their countries'&nbsp;deficit and&nbsp;high unemployment,&nbsp;and facing sluggish growth in their economy.&nbsp; We could just rest on our laurels, and keep on going like business as usual.&nbsp; But I do not think the Government is doing so.&nbsp; Instead, the Government is leveraging on&nbsp;the strong economic&nbsp;growth momentum&nbsp;to transform our economy further, building a stronger foundation for growth based on productivity as recommended by the Economic Strategies Committee.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, looking through my speech last night and&nbsp;comparing it to the speech that I made in the last Budget debate, I realised that it is very similar in the sense that the Government is very consistent looking at productivity as the main aim.&nbsp; I know that the man-on-the-street&nbsp;is more excited and more interested in the amount each and every family is receiving from the Government's Grow and Share package.&nbsp; But the more important aspect of the Budget is the long-term impact as well as the transformation that will affect all of us and our children.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have three concerns in this particular Budget and hope the Government will address them.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spoken previously that&nbsp;cheap foreign labour is like a form of addiction for the companies. I would like to continue on this tone to say that we cannot continue to pursue our growth based on low-cost foreign labour as there are immense social implications. I am a little worried when I hear our esteemed Opposition colleagues calling for foreign and domestic maids to be made as a standard item for every single household. We are really getting too reliant on foreign labour. The foreign workers, in fact, are propping up the high standard of living in  <p align=left>Column: 2879<p> Singapore. They perform many unpopular jobs that are not performed by Singaporeans. The construction industry and many service industries are highly dependent on low-cost foreign labour to augment the manpower requirement. Without the low-cost foreign labour, they may have been out of business long ago.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although in the short term, we have all benefited and foreign labour has helped our companies remain competitive, cheap foreign labour is like an addictive drug that will get our companies hooked and dependent.&nbsp; Ultimately, our companies will pay dearly for the erosion of productivity and the lack of innovation which is beginning to show.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I checked the Internet last night, looking at what is the meaning of drug abuse.&nbsp; This is what I got from the National Institute of Drug Abuse information website, it reads:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Drug addiction is a complex illness characterised by intense and, at times, uncontrollable drug craving, along with compulsive drug seeking and usage that persists even in the face of devastating consequences.&nbsp; While the path to drug addiction begins with the voluntary act of taking drugs, over time a person's ability to choose not to do so becomes compromised, and seeking and consuming the drug becomes compulsive.\"<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked further and they highlighted within the website the principles of effective treatment for drug abuse. I shall list them and I hope that the Government can take note of the principles and see how we apply to our current productivity as well as Innovation Credit Scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) No single treatment is appropriate for everyone. So there is no one size fits all.</p><p align=left>Column: 2880<p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(ii) Treatment needs to be readily available, which means that we should cut more red tapes and make it easy to access.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) Effective treatment attends to multiple needs of the individual, not just his or her drug abuse. Likewise, there are other issues related to the requirement for foreign labour.&nbsp; Please examine the reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) Remaining in treatment for an adequate period of time is critical. So, whatever measures we put in, they have to be long term, they cannot fluctuate, according to economic situation.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v) Medications are an important element of treatment for many patients, especially when combined with counselling and other behavioural therapies. So, we cannot be&nbsp;dependent on medications alone, there must be behavioural therapy for a change in mindset&nbsp;of our business owners as well.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vi) An individual's treatment and services plan must be assessed continually and modified as necessary to ensure that it meets his or her changing needs.&nbsp; So, there must be a continual assessment of the company.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vii) Treatment need not be voluntary to be effective, which means that sometimes treatments have to be forced upon the companies. Likewise, drug use during treatment must be monitored continuously, if not lapses during treatment can and do occur.&nbsp; So, we may give companies some credits, but if we do not monitor properly, the same habits may happen again.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to reiterate that we need to wean the companies off their dependence.&nbsp; The treatment process is one that needs to be closely supervised and calibrated for each industry and each company&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp; If we institute a cold <p align=left>Column: 2881<p>turkey treatment, the withdrawal will be painful and sometimes may even be fatal. In fact, some companies may not survive the sudden withdrawal syndrome. I recommend a more calibrated and careful approach that allows our companies to adjust. The recent move by the Ministry of Manpower to limit the foreign workers numbers and quotas has affected many businesses, especially small and medium enterprises. Some business owners have lamented that they are rejecting orders due to lack of workers. As the current demand is strong, they are unable to take advantage of the surge to grow because of manpower shortages. They are willing to pay a higher levy for suitable foreign workers. I am not sure if the Government can consider a tiered levy system for those businesses that really need workers and have tried getting locals but failed in their attempt, to get foreign workers at a higher levy. In this way, if there are really good growth opportunities and employers do not mind paying a higher levy, they can continue to grow.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, we still have institute some form of treatment. The incentives that are provided by the Government to enhance productivity is a good antidote to ease the withdrawal symptoms. However, I feel that these incentives may sometimes be complicated and many business owners are confused. Many are not sure what they can claim for productivity and innovation, and some may do so just for the claim without any actual resultant increase in productivity. In short, supervision is lacking. It is like giving Subutex to a drug addict without a treatment programme. If it is not done properly, like some drug addicts, they may get addicted to the treatment instead.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest the Government set up an agency to engage and study those businesses that require and are highly dependent on these foreign workers. They can then develop and recommend changes to the management of these <p align=left>Column: 2882<p>businesses to adopt over time to reduce their reliance on foreign workers. If the management accepts the treatment, these companies may be granted temporary increases in their foreign workers quota beyond the current quota during the transition and the implementation phase as long as they are compliant to the prescription. The principles in effective treatment of drug abuse can be applied to assist our companies to wean off their dependence on low-cost foreign labour.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I am also concerned with the possible impact on the livelihood of low-wage Singaporeans. In the push for productivity, it is usually the repetitive, mundane and low-skilled jobs that get automated and these workers will be the first to be rendered redundant and retrenched. In a fast growing economy, like what we faced last year where many new jobs&nbsp;were created, there should not be a problem absorbing them into the economy. But in a slower-growth environment, as anticipated by our Government, this may pose challenges. While training is generally desired by many, the question is what do we do with a group that is not willing to go for training or a group that is unable to upskill further due to limited capability? Will this result in widening of the income gap in Singapore and increase our Gini coefficient?<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A reduction on low-cost foreign workers will also mean an end to cheap services that these workers provide. Our construction costs may go up. Cost of houses, infrastructure projects such as roads, new schools, new hospitals and upgrading projects for our estates may all be affected. Cleaning services, food and beverages, and retail services that rely heavily on foreign workers will also increase in costs. That will translate to a higher cost of living for all of us if the foreign worker levy increases without a corresponding increase in productivity. Therefore, we cannot afford to fail in this quest to increase productivity, otherwise  <p align=left>Column: 2883<p> we will end up with an increased cost of living and a decrease in standard of living.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like my previous parliamentary colleague, Dr Teo Ho Pin, I am concerned that this current Budget does not have a green focus. Singapore has pledged support for international efforts to combat climate change in Copenhagen. The Government has also identified green industries as a new source of growth and for Singapore companies to ride the next wave. But the truth is that the current Budget does not seem to contain much of all those. So I hope the Finance Minister can elaborate a little on this.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last point, I received an email from a resident just before the Budget Statement was read. The resident was asking me if the HDB utilities rebates as well as Service and Conservancy Charges (S&amp;CC) rebates will be given according to room type. In fact, she seemed to know that there were rebates even before the Budget Statement was read. So, it has become a standard item in every year's Budget. Many have asked previously for a revision for the way HDB rebates are given out. I understand that for administrative simplicity, giving out by room type is the most practical and easiest way. But in the past, when HDB prices were more homogeneous as there was only one type of HDB flat, that may be more practical. But in today's world, in order to fulfil the different housing requirements of Singaporeans, HDB has introduced many new schemes, including Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) and having special projects such as Pinnacle and Dawson estates. These projects are usually priced higher than the normal Build-To-Order (BTO) flats. The price of a 4-room HDB flat in Punggol Lodge ranges from $190,000 to $234,000. The price of a similarly sized 4-room flat in City View@Boon Keng is $523,000 to $597,000. It is almost up to three times <p align=left>Column: 2884<p>higher. Should the owners in both HDB flats be treated similarly when Government gives rebates during the years of surplus? The HDB executive apartments in some heartlands are priced lower than a 4-room flat in a DBSS project and yet the owners receive less rebates according to the room type distribution. One suggestion is for the Government to give rebates to owners of HDB flats according to the house value and also the annual income of the owner. These are the same criteria the Government uses to give the Growth Dividends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The source of low-cost foreign labour will not be here forever. They will start to dwindle as their own countries start to progress. It is time for us to wake up to the reality and make painful adjustments now before it is too late. Rather than calling for levies for foreign maids and foreign workers to be reduced, we have to think of how to cut our reliance on foreigners to do the work for us. Our cost of living may temporarily increase as we embark on this journey together because there is always a productivity lag even when we implement something. But with innovation and determination, I am very confident that we can succeed in this productivity journey together and emerge as a leaner, more efficient and more competitive nation.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support the motion.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong (Yio Chu Kang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>2.11 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seng Han Thong (Yio Chu Kang)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2011/20110228/20110228VS_163241.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*</I>.] Mr Speaker, prior to the announcement of this year's Budget, we heard Singaporeans' wish list and experts on their predictions. But there are two announcements that caught most Singaporeans and experts by surprise.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the removal of radio and TV licence fees. Before this, I remember more than 10 years ago, when I first entered <p align=left>Column: 2885<p>Parliament, we had urged the Government to remove this fee. Both within and outside Parliament, many people pressed for the removal of this fee. But the Government always had good reasons to reject such a suggestion, as they needed money to subsidise public programmes. So this time, when the Minster for Finance announced the move, we heard cheers in the House and we also noted that many Singaporeans applauded such a move. No one expected that the removal of a mere $110 TV licence fee and $27 radio licence fee would generate such a reaction, not even the Minister of Finance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second announcement is to return $4 billion that was withdrawn in 2009 to our country's reserves. Even Opposition MP, Mr Low Thia Khiang, was impressed&nbsp;by it. In fact, no one suggested that we should distribute this $4 billion. Everyone felt that the Government made the right decision. Some people said that this is \"surprise\" income and what we are doing is \"paying back what we owe\". In fact, what we are doing is putting the money back when we grow. When in need, we withdraw from it, and when we have surplus, we return it. So long as we are able to return the money to its original position, at the same time, strive to do better, for example, doing away with what we do not need, Singapore will be governed peacefully for the long haul. This is what many countries strive to do but are unable to achieve.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister has named this year's Budget a \"Growth and Share Budget\". TV and radio stations have praised the Budget and many Singaporeans welcomed it.&nbsp; <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I> described it as a \"comprehensive budget to battle inflation\", the <I>Straits Times</I> said there was \"something for everyone\", <I>Shin Min Daily News</I> described it as a \"hongbao for everybody\" and <I>Lianhe Wanbao</I> said that with the Budget,&nbsp; \"Money will be given out monthly\" . All of them had different ways to describe the Budget. In my opinion, this  <p align=left>Column: 2886<p> is a Budget that looks after both long-term and short-term interest. Speaking on looking after both interests, I recall an article that I read in <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I> a year ago. It was an article written by <I>Zaobao</I> feature writer Han Shan Yuan, titled \"What is representative of Singapore?\". In actual fact, what is most representative about Singapore is its concept of sustainable development. This is something unique to Singapore. Any responsible government, regardless of what it does, must look after both the long-term and short-term interests. In other words, they must look after the short-term needs of the people, and the long-term interests and future of the country. And this is something that is representative of Singapore.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, what Singaporeans are most concerned about is the cost of living, especially the lower-income families and older workers. &nbsp;In the short term, we have looked after them.&nbsp; We have set aside $3.2 billion to fight inflation, look after the low-income families and top-up Medisave Accounts.&nbsp; In terms of looking after long-term interests, the Government has set aside $3.4 billion to support companies' efforts to improve productivity and competitiveness. The Government is committed to raising the real income of Singaporeans by 30% over the next 10 years.&nbsp; This is a great challenge. It is not easy to achieve but we are confident, with the coordinated efforts of NTUC, the Government and employers. In actual fact, we have identified 12 industries that employ large numbers of low-income workers and we will help them upgrade their skills. To date, more than 15,000 workers have benefited and 80% of them have seen salary increments of 10%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, we want to develop a more inclusive society, so we must be concerned about problems faced by different stratas of the society.&nbsp; Currently, the sandwiched class is concerned about rising prices and their children's <p align=left>Column: 2887<p>education, low-income workers worry about inflation, elderly workers are worried about unemployment, and those in the lowest 10% income bracket are worried about everything. So by looking after both the short-term and the long-term interests, we are putting in place the concept of sustainable development.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, what we need to do is to ensure every spectrum of our society, from high income, low income, sandwiched class, older workers, younger workers, is able to share our vision. Convince them that if we can achieve what we set out to do, we will be able to enjoy the results.&nbsp; I would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance for delivering an excellent report card.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.17 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to join in this debate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang had, earlier before me, so much as dismissed this year's Budget as an election Budget.&nbsp; But when we analyse Mr Low's speech for what it really is, it really is an election response to our Budget.&nbsp; Wide-ranging in&nbsp;his criticisms but a dearth of solutions in his speech.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it is surprising that Mr Low is suggesting to lower the GST.&nbsp; Who does Workers' Party really want to help?&nbsp; High-income earners, we know, consume more and, therefore, pay higher GST.&nbsp; And we know that pool of tax collected gets re-distributed to the lower-income earners.&nbsp; These are old issues that have been ventilated, discussed and voted on and have been implemented for the benefit of <p align=left>Column: 2888<p>Singaporeans.&nbsp; We also know that the GST Credits, when they are returned to the public, are returned to the low-income earners, the 1-, 2- and 3-room HDB dwellers disproportionately to their advantage.&nbsp; So, who is the Workers' Party really trying to benefit by the reduction in the GST and the increase in the GST measures, which&nbsp;have proven so beneficial for the wider community in Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Mr Low questioned the recruitment of foreigners.&nbsp; Is the Workers' Party suggesting that there are too many, and which group does Mr Low want to repatriate?&nbsp; Is it the HDB builders, MRT builders, or the foreign domestic workers?&nbsp; These again are issues that have been debated and implemented for the benefit of Singaporeans.&nbsp; Besides, it is an age-old debate.&nbsp; The late Dr Goh Keng Swee very earlier on pushed through the welcoming of MNCs in the days where they were viewed as the new colonialists.&nbsp; But Dr Goh thought that having foreigners in Singapore would improve our economy, policies and GDP, it was implemented and much to the benefit of Singaporeans.&nbsp; Besides, MNCs like those which have settled down in the Marina Bay Financial Centre (MBFC) carry economies of scale where jobs are concerned.&nbsp; These institutions, these MNCs, they come, set foot in MBFC and create jobs.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp;it is not a question of turning the tap off&nbsp;on foreigners but it is to continue to look and calibrate the numbers to ensure that the flow of foreigners in Singapore benefit&nbsp;Singaporeans' interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, which is quite bewildering,&nbsp;is the complaint by Mr Low on food prices going up and, yet, offering no solutions&nbsp;for this.&nbsp; Rather than griping&nbsp;over the issue, we know that food prices have increased but much less when compared to other regions and other economies, we have only increased it by 1.8%, that is food inflation.&nbsp; A recent article in the <I>Straits Times</I> entitled&nbsp;\"High level team<p align=left>Column: 2889<p>looks out for profiteering\".&nbsp; I will just quote from here that \"NTUC Foodfare's 40 retail outlets&nbsp;froze&nbsp;prices for coffee, tea and canned drinks for the remainder&nbsp;of the year even as some foodcourts and coffeeshops raised their prices\".&nbsp; Three days later, Fairprice announced a 5% discount on 500 of its housebrand products until&nbsp;31st May.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, rather than just offering complaints, we are looking at solutions to deal with real issues on the ground, such as the increase in food prices albeit at 1.8% food inflation rate.&nbsp; And not only that, we are literally looking beyond the horizon, as this Government does, for solutions and, beyond the horizons here, it means geographically.&nbsp; NTUC is looking at contract farming to see how we can overcome price hikes at the source level so that this could be re-distributed to the consumers.&nbsp; So we are not just poking and jamming the Budget with complaints but no solutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth point, Sir, Mr Low questioned Singapore's growth.&nbsp; But we are not growing for growth sake.&nbsp; We grow for Singapore's sake.&nbsp; Just as an illustration, last year, our GDP was 14.5%. What did that translate to?&nbsp; That translated into a 2.1% unemployment rate compared with the near double digit unemployment in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US).&nbsp; But that is only half the benefit of growth.&nbsp; The other half, and very importantly, is that our employment rate also increased.&nbsp; The employment rate includes people who have gone out of the workforce because they are tired and want to take a break from the workforce and then re-entered the workplace and are able to find jobs.&nbsp; So, the 14.5% growth rate does translate into benefits for Singaporeans, certainly where&nbsp;job security and job placements are concerned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not in the&nbsp;business of quick fixes.&nbsp; We are long term, we are far-<p align=left>Column: 2890<p>sighted and we move for Singapore's benefit. &nbsp;Mr Low started off by dismissing the far-sighted Budget as an election one.&nbsp; But Mr Low wants to share, share, share.&nbsp; We, on the other hand, are responsible and&nbsp;want to Grow and Share.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.24 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Sir, in the last one week, I have been holding post-Budget dialogue sessions in my constituency as well as roundtable sessions in the business community and I would summarise some of the sentiments as follows.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the business community, there is mixed reaction primarily due to the higher foreign worker levy, amidst a very tight labour market.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we explained to them that they should try to innovate and increase productivity so that we can increase the overall competitiveness of the Singapore economy and, at the same time, increase real income by 30% for the next 10 years,&nbsp;it is clear that the real issues are two-fold.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, there is still a need for a paradigm shift which requires more persuasions with real examples given to the industry so that they would know how to go about innovating and changing old habits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, there is huge anxiety about the ease in which the various innovation and productivity funds can be tapped as past experience tells us that while intentions may be noble, the devil is in the details.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my colleague&nbsp;Ms Jessica&nbsp;Tan has spoken about that earlier on.&nbsp; There is also a sense that the agencies need to work together more closely as a holistic Government to be more proactive and to help businesses overcome the inertia and the \"how-tos\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A specific industry which I have always spoken about is the social enterprise industry.&nbsp; It&nbsp;felt a little&nbsp;left out as there&nbsp;are&nbsp;no concrete measures to help <p align=left>Column: 2891<p>grow the industry that sits between that of a charity and a&nbsp;pure for-profit entity.&nbsp; The question remains&nbsp;&ndash; how&nbsp;eager is the Government in encouraging social enterprise whose ethos is in building a self-help and mutual help, self-reliant&nbsp;inclusive society?&nbsp; While MCYS has been supportive, building an inclusive and self-reliant society requires efforts from a whole-of-Government approach,&nbsp;in particular, in encouraging tax regime and legislative framework,&nbsp;like examples from the Community&nbsp;Interest Companies (CIC) in United Kingdom or L3C in United States, or&nbsp;even just&nbsp;tweaking some of the incentives that are given via SPRING, EDB and IE Singapore&nbsp;to for-profit enterprises, could also&nbsp;help the social enterprises and send a much clearer signal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the general population&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;grassroots leaders and residents &ndash; are concerned,&nbsp;most people reacted very positively to the Budget calling this a \"people's\" Budget.&nbsp; They&nbsp;endorsed it as one that is correctly skewed towards taking care of the most needy but not forgetting the middle-income and sandwiched class.&nbsp; Some wish for more generous benefits in childcare-related issues and a greater urgency in tackling eldercare issues.&nbsp; In particular, a resident of mine came up to me and said that his father suffered a stroke recently and was looking for a nursing home.&nbsp; When he went to the nursing home, he discovered that he failed the means test but, at the same time, he cannot afford the $2,500 required by private nursing homes.&nbsp; He asked me what measures are there to help people like himself.&nbsp; I told him that it is in the Budget itself.&nbsp; We have transferred a lot of trust funds and enhanced the trust funds to enhance eldercare and the taking care of our senior citizens, especially patients who need long-term care. I told him to just be patient, <I>akan datang</I>.&nbsp; But he said that every day is a very, very long day for the family.&nbsp; I hope that the <p align=left>Column: 2892<p>Government will expedite on how these funds could be used and tapped on to help families with long-term care needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the whole, I would term this Budget as one that learns from the past.&nbsp; The returning of the $4 billion to the reserve funds, even though there was no constitutional need to do so, is a very big plus and showcases that our Government is a very prudent and responsible one.&nbsp; It is also a Budget that tackles the present challenges, battling the rising costs of living issues, rewarding hard work and sharing the funds of Singapore's labour via the $3.2 billion Grow and Share fund.&nbsp; It is also one that invests in the future via the $3.4 billion set aside for longer-term social investments through transfers to endowment and trust funds as well as more than $6 billion that has been set aside to enhance long-term measures for businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Changing the way we grow\", as the Finance Minister put it, through raising productivity by at least 30% over the next decade is not only a good move but one that is necessary, fairer and more inclusive approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It appears it is a forward-looking Budget.&nbsp; But, Sir, how do we know that it is a good and wise Budget that will work for Singapore?&nbsp; Most policies take time to mature.&nbsp; As the saying goes, we will only know in hindsight.&nbsp; Since this is my 10th year in Parliament, I decided to embark on a journey down memory lane, to take a very quick assessment of our budgetary effectiveness and wisdom in the last 10 years since 2001.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The test is a simple one&nbsp;&ndash; the criterion is simple.&nbsp; For the last 10 years, are we better off today in 2011 <I>vis-a-vis</I> 2001&nbsp;&ndash; economically and socially?&nbsp; The role of Budget is in sheltering, developing and seizing opportunities for Singaporeans through economic ups and downs while sharpening our saw.&nbsp; I have given some <p align=left>Column: 2893<p>handouts to Members in this House.&nbsp; If&nbsp;Members refer to that, we would be able to see whether our Budget team has been responsive to both internal and external challenges as well as the results of the decisions made in those circumstances.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, we entered the year well&nbsp;and&nbsp;remember that Budget is usually in February or March&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the Budget&nbsp;theme for that year was \"Entering the new millennium: A place for everyone\".&nbsp; Little did we know that in 2001 there was the 911 incident.&nbsp; It sent the real growth down to -1.2% but we recovered very well the next year and the Budget theme for that year was&nbsp;\"A budget for a different world\", and that was of course post-911.&nbsp; Then, we recorded a growth of 4.2% in real economic growth terms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in 2003, coming out from the post-911, we said \"Seizing opportunity in uncertainty\" and, I think, round about that time we also experienced SARS.&nbsp; Again, although we went into some quarters of recession, we recovered and grew in real terms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in 2004, our&nbsp;theme was \"Building a future of opportunity\".&nbsp; Things went well and so the next year we said the Budget theme was \"Creating opportunity, building community\".&nbsp;&nbsp;This was still very&nbsp;much post-SARS era.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, in 2006, since we had been achieving a few years of growth, the Budget&nbsp;theme was \"Building on our strengths, creating our best home\".&nbsp; Then, we achieved 8.7% that year in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2007, we came out with the theme \"Ready for the future, ready for the world\".&nbsp; Little did we know that in 2008 itself we will experience a dip in the economic performance because of, again, global circumstances and the financial crisis.&nbsp; That year in 2008, we started the year saying that we wanted to create a<p align=left>Column: 2894<p>top quality economy, building a resilient community and, I think, we did quite well despite the global recession registering a real economic growth rate of 1.5%.&nbsp; But, of course, by the end of 2008 we knew that the world was going into quite a turbulent time, so the theme for&nbsp;2009 was \"Keeping jobs, building for the future\".&nbsp; We had a negative year&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;-0.8%.&nbsp;&nbsp;But then we came back very strongly in 2010 with 14.5% improvement and the Budget theme&nbsp;for that year was \"Towards an advanced economy: superior skills, quality jobs, higher incomes\".&nbsp; And, of course, in 2011, we know that our Finance Minister has themed this Budget \"Growing incomes, strengthening our society\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is interesting is also, if&nbsp;Members look at the overall GDP growth in the handout,&nbsp;Members would see the overall GDP growth to be one that only dipped in 2009.&nbsp; If we draw a tangent across the graph, Members will realise that, despite some ups and some downs, it is still an upward growth in our GDP.&nbsp; In fact, if&nbsp;Members look at the absolute numbers, our GDP has almost doubled from $163 billion to $285 billion against all odds, growing every year except in 2009.&nbsp; Translated at the ground level, the lay person experiences a higher standard of living.&nbsp; Personal wants and desires&nbsp;in 2001 like mobile phones, overseas holidays, etc, have now become basic needs in 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I think, the Government has scored quite well on the whole especially in terms of business and Government efficiency.&nbsp; I do not have time to elaborate, but if&nbsp;Members refer to the handout,&nbsp;they will&nbsp; see that <I>vis-a-vis</I> other parts of the world we have done very well.&nbsp; As the Finance Minister said, we cannot control external circumstances but we seek to recover faster each time.&nbsp; So, I want to acknowledge the wisdom and the stewardship that has been put in by our Budget Team and, of course, the entire <p align=left>Column: 2895<p>Government for executing them well on the whole.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Mr Speaker, Sir, while the Government&nbsp; has scored high on economic performance, Government and business efficiency, more needs to be done on people-centric infrastructure and approach, inclusiveness, social cohesion, national pride and the sense of belonging.&nbsp; In the Budget Speech itself, the Finance Minister referred to statistics&nbsp;in the last 10 years which showed great strides in the nominal income growth of our low-income families from the 20th percentile and median&nbsp;household income&nbsp;in the 50th percentile.&nbsp; In real terms, however, the median household outpaced the growth in the lower-income household by quite a lot.&nbsp; We need to improve on this and, as such, Budget 2011's emphasis on real productivity growth is spot on.&nbsp; However, improving productivity should be more wide-based and widely defined to include not just office, shop front or factory-based work but also those who may be working at home, working out of laptops via mobile commuting, working in sheltered workshops, social enterprises, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With changing demographic landscape, changing work landscape, and so on,&nbsp;we need to think out of the box and&nbsp;apply the concept of productivity beyond the traditional workplace.&nbsp; Our policies and funding must catch up with business and social innovation that is already happening in homes and business places to reflect the new reality and enable Singaporeans many roads to success and real income growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On people-centric infrastructure and approach, with a global power shift from centralised institution to the distributed&nbsp;periphery network, there are signs that the Government is getting it and beginning to translate them into policy <p align=left>Column: 2896<p>measures.&nbsp; Evidence is seen in many Ministries such as the Ministry of Health (MOH) which has adopted a much more patient-centric care and even many years back started making hospital bills and treatment more transparent.&nbsp; The Ministry of&nbsp;Transport (MOT) not too long ago&nbsp;also announced the need to move from functional planning of public transport infrastructure to human-centric public transport system.&nbsp; And in the Ministry of Education (MOE), learning has also moved from the one-size-fits-all didactic teaching to individual customisation to help the child achieve his or her personal best.&nbsp; This has helped many students and families achieve better social mobility.&nbsp; A very good example was a girl who came to my MPS two months or so&nbsp;ago to update me on her latest progress.&nbsp; She was actually getting married at that point and she wanted to have a flat.&nbsp; She was still in school and she started the conversation by saying: \"Miss Low, do you recognise me?&nbsp; I came to you many years ago.&nbsp; I was then an ITE student and I was asking for help to get me into the polytechnic which I had gotten into, and now I am completing my studies in the university.\"&nbsp; I was very, very proud of her and what really touched me was that she&nbsp;was grateful, she came back and she said \"thank you\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is evidence of the sort of social mobility that our students can achieve.&nbsp; In the past, it would have been very difficult for her to get a place in the university if she had gone to ITE,&nbsp;but, today, these avenues are open.&nbsp; And I hope that we could expedite the opening up of such avenues so that there could be greater social mobility and a much more human-centric approach to policy making and giving opportunities to all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many feel that this is still not happening fast enough.&nbsp; So I hope that given the crowded city&nbsp;that we are, where aspirations are on the ground, standards of living are high and the demands on the city folks,&nbsp;I urge the Government to pump in more resources to <p align=left>Column: 2897<p>actualise and expedite the shift to a more people-centric Government and work with the industry and people to create a new social compact where every citizen is empowered to do more for themselves and for the country.&nbsp; What we need, I think, is a Team Singapore approach.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Team Singapore approach, I think there is a need to do more in creating shared value and social cohesion.&nbsp; While we keep the traditional methods, we need to examine how we can further cultivate and invest into shared value using social media, people, public, private partnerships, innovative vehicles that blur lines between profit and for-profit hybrid vehicle enterprises that contribute to both financial and social bottom lines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there are many help schemes out there for residents who need help, not everyone wants a handout approach; not everyone wants to go on welfare.&nbsp; And here I relate a story which touches my heart and I will say this in Mandarin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2011/20110228/20110228VS_163424.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</I>] At the Meet-the-People Session, a resident has been coming to see me for the past two-three years. She always came around 10 o'clock, just when I was about to close the door. And when she came in, she was always perspiring and looked unkempt, but still relatively tidy. And her clothes looked rather dated.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she came in, she would very politely tell me that \"I don't need any handouts.&nbsp; I only need a licence to sell ice cream.\"&nbsp; I asked her why.&nbsp; She said \"I have a husband who is a stroke patient, and he is unable to move around and many places will not accept him and give him a job. I have two young school-going children, so I am holding two jobs.&nbsp; My first job is a cleaner's job, my second job is an odd-job worker.&nbsp; I have two jobs so I cannot ask you for a third job. But if I <p align=left>Column: 2898<p>have a licence to sell ice cream, then I can be independent.\"&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her, \"You are so tired, why do you need another job?&nbsp; Why don't you just let us help you?&nbsp; Whatever your children's needs, be it school fees or expenses he needs to go to school, we can help you.&nbsp; If you have any needs in your home, for example, medical fees, we can pay for you.&nbsp; If you don't have sufficient money for household expenses, we can also help you.\"&nbsp; But she says, \"No, I am not here to ask for handouts.&nbsp; We may be poor, have very low income and little education, we have nothing but we still have our dignity.&nbsp; If I ask for handouts from you, then I will not even have any dignity left.&nbsp; I might as well be a beggar.\"&nbsp; So, even though she is poor, she is full of dignity.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What she needs is not handouts, what she needs is to be given a chance to be independent.&nbsp; What she needs is a job, she wants to work hard. Furthermore, I was heartened when she said, \"Although I'm poor and life is hard, I still have hands and legs. I can still do a lot of work with my hands. I want to be a good example for my children, so that they will learn from me.&nbsp; I don't want to get handouts and I know that you MPs go through a lot of trouble to solve the residents' problem, to raise funds.&nbsp; I would like to donate this money to other people.&nbsp; Just give me a licence to sell ice cream.\"</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought her story deserves praise.

Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan (Nominated Member):</B> Thank you, Sir, for this opportunity to articulate my strong support for the Budget announced.&nbsp; I would first like to thank the Government and the Minister for a very responsible, forward-looking Budget.&nbsp; I am particularly impressed with the Government's commitment to sustainable growth.&nbsp; We see this especially in the return to reserves, and <p align=left>Column: 2900<p>especially in the bold initiatives to transform the labour force.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposal to raise the levy for foreign workers is not popular with businesses that rely on low-cost labour but I believe it is critical for the long-term well-being of low-income Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure if I understood the hon. Member Mr Low Thia Khiang's arguments that this initiative would not benefit Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key lesson that is reinforced in Budget 2011 is&nbsp;that we must continue to grow a bigger pie so that there will be more for re-distribution.&nbsp; While Singapore is not known to be a welfare state,&nbsp;I believe we&nbsp;certainly have one of the most generous governments in the world.&nbsp; Thank you, Minister Tharman.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, may I focus my speech on two main themes:&nbsp;the importance of corporate social responsibility in sustainable growth, and the challenges arising from emerging trends that require state intervention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as we look forward to the redistribution of achievements from 2010, I am acutely aware that we cannot rely solely on the Government to provide the magic potion that bridges income inequality.&nbsp; This business must partner the Government in this endeavour.&nbsp; Unlike Mr Low, I think it will be short-sighted to think that the Government can do it all alone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has, through its pro-business policies, made Singapore a desired destination for business investments. Businesses that invest in Singapore can rely on a world-class labour force that is endowed with a close to 100% literacy rate and a strong and stable Government led by men and women of the highest integrity, which ensures social and political stability so that investors can conduct their affairs in a conducive environment that is supported by pro-business policies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2901<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For long-term sustainability of this partnership, businesses must play their part.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have&nbsp;two items on my wish list for employers.&nbsp; First, businesses must invest in labour so that our partnership can be sustained.&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge employers to take a long-term perspective when they invest in human resource.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must rethink reliance on low-cost foreign labour for that will, in the long run, produce an underclass of Singaporeans and destabilise our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budget 2011 has enhanced incentives for businesses to invest in technology and transform the labour force.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope businesses in Singapore will rise to the challenge for a higher-skilled labour force will result in greater efficiency and increased productivity &ndash; a win-win situation for both businesses and Singapore.&nbsp; I appeal to employers to see the hike in foreign worker levy in tandem with the generous incentives for businesses to level up on productivity.&nbsp; Passing the higher cost of hiring foreign workers to the consumers would hurt both consumers as well as businesses.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, I urge employers to play their part in transforming the workplace and level up on the skills of the existing labour pool.&nbsp; Relying on 10 well-trained workers makes better business sense than trying to manage a transient pool of&nbsp;10 low-skilled workers.&nbsp;&nbsp; My second wish is for businesses to partner the Government in managing the impact of inflation on low-income workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am&nbsp;very impressed with the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) for playing their part in keeping basic necessities affordable.&nbsp; Thanks to the lead taken by the NTUC Fairprice, several other supermarkets have come forward to pledge their commitment to keep prices for basic necessities stable.&nbsp; In addition, NTUC Foodfare's pledge to hold off price increases for basic essential beverages is much appreciated by low-income households.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my opinion, NTUC exemplifies good corporate social responsibility.&nbsp; Price hikes <p align=left>Column: 2902<p>on basic necessities hurt low-income households most.&nbsp; Sustained inflation, if not checked will result in entrenching income instability.&nbsp; If we do not address the income gap, we risk destabilising our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal to businesses to be mindful of the needs of low-income households and to make conscientious decisions to alleviate the stress of price hikes for this segment of our society.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are able to protect the affordability of basic necessities, it will help address concerns of inflation and enable low-income households stretch their buying power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that many more businesses &ndash; especially those involved in provision of essential services like healthcare, food and beverage outlets and grocery will also embrace the philosophy of community service demonstrated by the NTUC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I move on to emerging trends which require State intervention?&nbsp; There are two areas of concern which I would like to highlight: the growing proportion of singles, and that of older Singaporeans living alone.&nbsp; Last year, in my Budget speech,&nbsp;I shared with the House,&nbsp;developments of my fish pond.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please allow me to give&nbsp;Members an update.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped adding the bags of inexpensive small fish&nbsp;because I was getting concerned that I may be overcrowding my pond and polluting the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, all that is left is&nbsp;my reliable catfish, a few lingering small ones, and my&nbsp;nine beautiful <I>kois</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly, I have been watching, hoping to bring good news to the House but no baby <I>koi</I> or no baby catfish has emerged.&nbsp; Instead, I just have ageing <I>kois</I>.&nbsp; At this rate, I will probably have to replace the entire population when the fish die off!&nbsp;&nbsp; We must ensure that this does not happen to Singapore.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Sir, my concern with young singles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest census advance release  <p align=left>Column: 2903<p> confirmed the growing proportion of singles age 25 to 30 years.&nbsp; This is especially worrying for females, because if we marry only after 30 years, the likelihood of having more than&nbsp;one child is very&nbsp;low.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must look seriously into the structural constraints that may hamper courtship.&nbsp; Why are&nbsp;our young women&nbsp;in that age-group not&nbsp;getting married?&nbsp; From my research, three noteworthy reasons surfaced: they complain of a limited social circle, limited time and they find that they have attractive contesting life goals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I look at these issues holistically, I think that if I were to look&nbsp;for a solution,&nbsp;my focus would be on the demands of paid work.&nbsp; If we are serious about tackling the concerns with lower fertility which in turn results in a fast greying population, we must address this concern of overwork among younger Singaporeans.&nbsp; To ensure that investment in family will not come at too high an opportunity cost to Singaporeans, I propose that we should relook the performance-based evaluation system, so that we can develop clear, reasonable performance targets for employees in the various job capacities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, we leave to too much to peer competition to determine outstanding performance.&nbsp; This results in a high-stressed situation where employees have to constantly out-compete each other for that elusive \"A\" grade each year.&nbsp; While this system may result in more efficient output in the short run, there are adverse effects to the long-term stability of a stable Singapore.&nbsp;It results in a high-stressed competitive system in the workplace&nbsp;which encourages setting short-term goals which have to be&nbsp;delivered year-on-year.&nbsp;&nbsp;This leaves very little time and energy for other commitments.&nbsp; The effects can be observed among young Singaporeans in the labour force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2904<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is a strong tenacity among our youth to achieve their career aspirations and they do this with the sense of urgency, they do not seem to view courtship and&nbsp;marriage with the same sense of urgency.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was an undergraduate and single,&nbsp;I was very sure I wanted to get married.&nbsp; I wanted to get married&nbsp;and I wanted to grow my own family.&nbsp; It was a singular&nbsp;most important life goal for me at that time,&nbsp;so I was very focused on achieving it.&nbsp; When I met my husband, I immediately knew that he was \"the&nbsp;one\" and I spent all my efforts in ensuring that he knew I was the one for him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we need to inject this sense of urgency in our youths when they consider courtship and marriage.&nbsp; I think too many have conveniently married their vocations.&nbsp; We need to help them navigate their way back to the social realm.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to address urgently.&nbsp; As the proportion of singles grows and singlehood becomes a norm for youths in their late 20s, it also becomes much easier for singles to rationalise their singlehood status.&nbsp;I believe that the attitudinal barriers towards marriage articulated by many singles &ndash; their complaints about expensive housing, no time, etc, these are, in part, rationalisation and justification for their singlehood status.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I met my husband, we had very little amassed.&nbsp; We decided to get married and move to Singapore &ndash; with no&nbsp;job offers, not much savings and no home to call our own.&nbsp; But&nbsp;we had each other and we believed we had enough and were optimistic about building our future together.&nbsp; So I believe that the key to our fertility woes really lies in reducing the singlehood figures and helping our youths find their Significant Other because once you have found that partner in life, I think you will believe that you can&nbsp;overcome everything.&nbsp; The data we have strongly suggests that fertility rate is healthy among married couples.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak on <p align=left>Column: 2905<p>this further in the COS debate where I will urge the civil service to take the lead in protecting the private time for Singaporeans to engage in an active social life and nurture relationships.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second and final concern is on the well-being of elderly Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am much encouraged by the news that we will be investing in long-term care.&nbsp; The latest census data shows a growing proportion of single-member and two-member households.&nbsp; This alerts us to concerns that more Singaporeans will grow old either alone or in the company of an aged&nbsp;spouse.&nbsp; To prepare for this, we have to put in place an infrastructure that supports ageing in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;While we will continue to encourage three-generation families, we must also recognise that many older Singaporeans will have to manage growing old and living alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we help older Singaporeans live independently and age gracefully in their own homes for as long as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I applaud the HDB for actualising the studio apartment concept.&nbsp; This will certainly meet the needs of older Singaporeans in middle-income and below households.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the HDB consider engaging an \"executive condominium\" concept to meet the housing needs of upper-middle income elderly, rather than have each of these households exist independently and reliant on a foreign domestic worker to facilitate ageing in place?&nbsp; I think it will be more cost-effective for Singapore if we provide for housing needs of this group of older Singaporeans through the provision of retirement communities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These executive condominium communities will have infrastructure that supports assisted living and will promote ageing in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Government, through the HDB, will consider planning for \"Pinnacle II@Changi\" where studio apartments will be showcased in a private estate sculptured to meet the needs of <p align=left>Column: 2906<p>the elderly and where healthcare, security, cleaning and nutrition needs of the residents will be provided for.&nbsp; As this is probably the last Sitting that we would have, I just want to tell the Government in the House that I have learnt a lot in these past one and a half to two years.&nbsp; One of the most illuminating lessons is how hard the Government works at providing for Singapore and I want to take this opportunity to thank the House and to thank the Government.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to some of Mr Low Thia Khiang's comments mentioned earlier. Number one, he commented that this was an election Budget. Can we help it if the two dates happen to be in close proximity to each other? Let me stress to him that it would be very short-sighted and unlike the trademark, and also track record of our Government to not plan for the future. So this is a visionary Budget and it is not just an election Budget. In fact, we live in a very competitive global world. We must plan for the position of Singapore for the future. And that is what this Budget is all about.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, he mentioned about not handling very well the cost of living which is continuing to rise very well. I would like to invite him to revisit the four major <p align=left>Column: 2907<p>anchor plans that have been stipulated very clearly by the Finance Minister which explain how we are handling this issue. In fact, we are one of the first nations in the world to set up a Committee, like the Retail Price Workgroup and they have already started working. Is that not&nbsp;fast enough for Mr Low?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, he mentioned that for more than 40 years, Singaporeans have been disillusioned and disempowered which I find it&nbsp;a very offensive comment.&nbsp; I would like to invite Mr Low to come and take a look at my constituency, a PAP-run constituency in Geylang Serai, where we would show him how we do it at Geylang Serai, where there is no such thing as disillusionment and disempowerment, and more like our tagline in the constituency \"vibrant Geylang Serai, in rhythm and harmony\". I will be glad to show him around.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, he also mentioned that he was amazed that we needed organisations such as Food from the Heart to help others, when we have a Government. Well, I think he is being misinformed because we have more than 32 different schemes under MCYS to help the people. As someone who champions volunteerism, humanitarianism and also philanthropy, I find this not appropriate. Is he giving a signal to our NGOs that they are not needed? They are doing very good work and an excellent job on the ground, and the NGOs come together and make up our nation. They have certain characteristics which make up Singapore and this is like in many other first world countries in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, this is an inclusive and visionary Budget. It is no mean feat for the little red dot to spend so much. It is the mark of a fiscally strong state. Budget 2011 is balanced and grounded in fiscal prudence. It reflects Government&rsquo;s care <p align=left>Column: 2908<p>for the people, whilst at the same time, making provisions for economic growth and progress. We have done well, but we still have far to go. We faced the crisis but there may be others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"&#22269;&#31119;&#27665;&#24378;\".&nbsp;Literally translated, this means when the nation is rich, the people are strong.&nbsp; But the people will only be strong if we are together and united.&nbsp; With every Budget, each will ask \"what is in it for me?\" Money is important, we agree. But so is our community engagement; inter-religious and inter-racial harmony and understanding; being a gracious society; empathy and compassion; serving humanity with sincerity and defending our nation. Let us take the example of the recent changes proposed to the foreign workers levy. There was much hue and cry as many looked at it from the material and money perspective. Sure, the money is important. But can we open up our mindsets to see the bigger picture?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the reason behind the policy to nudge businesses to increase productivity.&nbsp; Our average productivity rate is only about a third compared to the global leaders in productivity. Second, to allow businesses to review and look at what I will call the 3Ms, different from the ones used in healthcare, that is, Mechanistion, changing their Mindsets, and of course to review their finances or Money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many times have we heard people lamenting that foreign workers are taking our jobs? Let us look at this rationally. When advertisements for jobs with shifts and longer hours as bus drivers, in the construction industry and several others are put up, we shy away. If we are not doing these jobs, we need the foreign workers. They contribute to our economy. Currently, with some three million workers &ndash; about two million are Singaporeans and a million are foreign workers &ndash; if we were to send the one million back, who will do these jobs? Even <p align=left>Column: 2909<p>with our current unemployment rate of 2.2%, these positions will never be filled by our locals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singaporean worker today has to realise&nbsp;that when he seeks employment, the competition is not just from another Singaporean but at the global level. But there will come a day when these workers from India, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam may not want to come here as their own countries and economies are growing and becoming more global and competitive. Who then will build our ships, manufacture the electronic goods, construct our skyscrapers and clean our facilities? Will Singaporeans be able to jump on the wagon and position themselves to fill these jobs then? What we are doing now? We are molding our strategies based on current mindsets of Singaporeans. But what is crucial is we have to position ourselves in the global arena. If we do not remain relevant and competitive, we will have little to offer the world market.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me at this juncture share an analogy. A businessman arrived in a city late past dinner time and he checked into a hotel. Exhausted, he did not feel like having dinner and so called for room service and requested for a vanilla milkshake. &nbsp;A voice at the other end replied: \"Sorry Sir, we do not have milkshake on the menu.\"&nbsp;The businessman thought for a second and said: \"Do you have milk, vanilla ice cream, a tall glass, a straw and a long spoon?\" &nbsp;\"Yes, Sir,\" came the response.&nbsp;\"Please send these up.\" That evening, the businessman enjoyed his vanilla milkshake by stirring the ice cream into the tall glass of cold milk, sipping it with the straw and stirring it with the long spoon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story of the milkshake is simple, not extraordinary but a new perspective &ndash; an open mindset able to circumvent and innovate. That is exactly what we need&nbsp;and how we need to be outstanding, <p align=left>Column: 2910<p>outrageous and able to think out of the box. That single, individual mindset change can affect families, companies, corporations and even nations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the crisis, when many countries made decisions to freeze salaries, we introduced WIS, upskilling and reskilling, and gave out grants to assist SMEs. Now, our model is sought after globally. So, can we sustain to get that 30%&nbsp;real growth in wages over the next decade? This is a significant target indeed and it will increase the real purchasing power of Singaporeans. I am supportive of setting a target for us to efficiently work towards and aspire to, but I would like to ask the Finance Minister if this is feasible, as he mentioned, as a long-term major strategy for combating rising costs and inflation. Moreover, there is at least one macro issue that will tend to become more prominent, that is, our rapidly ageing population and decreasing birth rates. Will we be able to replace the baby-boomer generation as they retire? Will the reduced talent pool that we are likely to face, come so soon, and then we will face the talent war? These are issues we have to prepare and carefully plan for the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also have two other suggestions for the Finance Minister to consider in future Budgets.&nbsp; Firstly, some incentives and funding for sports and our NSAs. This does not refer to only those sports which are Olympic medal generating, but also other high participation sports which we do here. Secondly, with our rapidly ageing populace and high incidence of chronic debilitating diseases and illnesses, some form of well-thought-out and structured caregivers or aged parental care allowances would indeed be a welcome.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I speak in support of the Budget.&nbsp; Many of the residents that I have spoken to are in support although not everyone is satisfied with what they will receive.&nbsp; Sir, this is to be expected.&nbsp; It is human nature.&nbsp; But on balance, many also agree there is little to fault from this Budget in that it is generous in varying degrees and crafted with everyone in mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The business community, however, may be caught off-guard having to re-adjust their dependence on foreign workers with the increase in the levy.&nbsp; Although I&nbsp;share some of their concerns and also empathise with the SMEs, unfortunately, I think&nbsp;it is a necessary bitter pill to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;swallow and to take&nbsp;now.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister spoke about the strategy to increase in real incomes of our workers over the next 10 years.&nbsp; We have to start today with the measures in place to see this through.&nbsp; The dependence on foreign workers to meet business demands has stagnated the wages of our low-skilled labour.&nbsp; As we upskill workers with the re-designing of jobs to attract more Singaporeans to take on jobs that businesses need, we would also need to address the easy way out that we have taken for so&nbsp;many years.&nbsp; The easy way out is not meant as a criticism of business but it describes an&nbsp;expedient means to meet the labour demands that businesses have to address.&nbsp; There is&nbsp;no denying that it is a bitter pill for businesses to swallow.&nbsp; But I would like to caution that not taking the bitter pill now will mean that we are taking poison pills each day that we do not&nbsp;begin to tackle this.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be terminal for our workers and our businesses and for Singapore.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this an election year? &nbsp;It probably is by all indications.&nbsp; Is this Budget crafted so that&nbsp;the PAP may win the election?&nbsp; I <p align=left>Column: 2913<p>am guessing that it may have&nbsp;crossed the&nbsp;Finance Minister&rsquo;s mind but it is in all probability not in sync with the character of this Government.&nbsp; Just by raising the foreign worker levy runs the risk of upsetting the 130,000 SMEs.&nbsp; The levy could have waited until next year long after the result of the election is known.&nbsp; True to the character of good governance, if it the right thing to do, even though painful, we will do it and do so expediently.&nbsp; But notwithstanding good governance as reflected in a good Budget, Sir, please allow me to share some of my views and reservations.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For starters, I am extremely uncomfortable for Singapore as a whole to come to expect to be given a share of our national coffers whenever&nbsp;we&nbsp;are in&nbsp;surplus.&nbsp; My unease is heightened when I hear and read&nbsp;about some quarters calling on the Government to share national wealth whenever there is a&nbsp;surplus and not wait until it is an&nbsp;election year,&nbsp;for it is&nbsp;an assumption that in an election year, the Budget will be filled with goodies and payouts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the financial crisis, we did not suffer the ugly fate of some Asian states being raided by irresponsible funds only because of our strong financial position.&nbsp; Our reserves accumulated over all the years of prudence put us in good stead.&nbsp; We would not have been able to do that if we had started to share surpluses whenever there were surpluses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need always to save for a rainy day.&nbsp; I think in current times, we need to save for a rainy season.&nbsp; We were lucky to have escaped the global financial crisis not too long ago&nbsp;with little long-term effects on our economy and financial health.&nbsp; We cannot expect to be so lucky all the time.&nbsp; The Year of the Rabbit is turning out to be full of surprises.&nbsp; The political instability in the oil-producing countries is causing an unstoppable spiral <p align=left>Column: 2914<p>in oil prices.&nbsp; We are unsure of the developments in Libya.&nbsp; The unrest places a spectre over&nbsp;the oil-producing countries.&nbsp; Would further hikes in&nbsp;oil prices lead to a global recession?&nbsp; Where will we be and how do we meet those challenges?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, in training to be fit, the catch word for any fitness buff when beginning to train is that of core muscles.&nbsp; The core muscles&nbsp;are similar to the soul of the country.&nbsp; Developing core muscle is important as it provides a body balance and stability.&nbsp; The same must be said&nbsp;for Singapore&rsquo;s&nbsp;nation-building effort.&nbsp; What is our core muscle?&nbsp; Besides having the good fortune of having a group of honest and capable men and women running the country since Independence, we should also be thankful for the core institutions in Singapore. &nbsp;A weak government and a feeble civil service would surely sink us.&nbsp; Singapore&rsquo;s future will be finished.&nbsp; We would&nbsp;be a \"has been\" and foreign investors will give us a miss.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another core characteristic of Singapore is to instil in our institutions a kind of crisis management mode.&nbsp; Our leaders had been made fun of, ridiculed even, for making use of the fear element of Singapore being in a&nbsp;crisis mode and in constant paranoia.&nbsp; We only need to cast our mind back to the Asian financial crisis and the outcome for Singapore.&nbsp; The outcome for us is better than most, if not all of our immediate neighbours.&nbsp; When our immediate region was gripped in economic recession, we were able to fork out extra budgetary measures of more than $10 billion to help our people.&nbsp; But, Sir, is&nbsp;this heightened alertness that has kept us safe and well, is this enough with this heightened alertness?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This crisis management attitude that we&nbsp;have been criticised of had allowed us to enjoy a comfortable state of affairs and managed our cash well.&nbsp; I dare say that the&nbsp;same people who brand us as being paranoid are here enjoying the fruits of  <p align=left>Column: 2915<p> such \"paranoia\".&nbsp; In fact, Sir, I would even go as far to say that the heightened crisis management mode is in our DNA.&nbsp; To me, Sir, this Budget also reflects how we have moved from&nbsp;just crisis management to about Singapore being prepared.&nbsp; Returning the $4 billion is preparing us by keeping us in a good fiscal position to deal with future crises.&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising workers&rsquo; levy, although not popular with businesses, is necessary to prep local workers for the challenges ahead.&nbsp; Increasing productivity is to help our economy leap over the spectre of stagnation.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Before I end, Sir,&nbsp;I have a call to make on&nbsp;the Government and&nbsp;for them to&nbsp;consider more programmes for caregivers.&nbsp; Member Mdm Halimah had talked about the tough life of the singles who care for the aged.&nbsp; I, too, see this to be an increasing phenomenon.&nbsp; Some of&nbsp;our hon. colleagues in the House had spoken passionately on&nbsp;the stress of caregivers.&nbsp; In this regard, my residents, like those Mdm Halimah had cited, had the good fortune of seeing the good work of ComCare.&nbsp; The programme provided relief to an elderly father and his intellectually-challenged middle-aged daughter.&nbsp; The gentleman in his 70s is frail but he cares for his daughter.&nbsp; I met them at their flat and in that 25 minutes, she laughed, she cried, she yelled, she cooed all in between moments of lucidity.&nbsp; In her moments of clear-mind lucidity, she provided care for her father and even cooked for him.&nbsp; Sir, ComCare's EnAble programme has provided much relief along with the grassroots volunteers and&nbsp;I urge our Government to place the care of caregivers in our long-term care programme&nbsp;as well.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Defence (Assoc.

Prof. Koo Tsai Kee)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2916<p>[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2011/20110228/20110228VS_163922.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</I>] Mr Speaker, Sir, after listening to MP Low Thia Khiang&nbsp;&ndash; unfortunately, he is not here at this moment&nbsp;&ndash; I feel that MP Low has exaggerated what he said.&nbsp; Indeed, Singapore faces some small issues, they are not major issues.&nbsp; These issues were not created by Singapore, but big issues faced by Asia and the entire world. On the contrary, the economic performance of Singapore in 2010 was spectacular.&nbsp; MP Low did not emphasise this point. Last year, the PAP Government produced an excellent report card.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that our inflation problem is very severe, but this is not true. Last year, inflation was just 2.7%.&nbsp; The median income of our workers increased by 3.3%.&nbsp; In other words, the salary increment of our workers was enough to compensate for inflation.&nbsp; Inflation is not a problem unique to Singapore, but a problem faced by the whole of Southeast Asia.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was driving yesterday, I heard radio reports about the Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR facing tremendous criticisms from angry residents of Hong Kong. And that is because the budget announced recently did not effectively solve the problems faced by the Hong Kong people. On the other hand, the Singapore Government is able to introduce a range of measures to deal with inflation. The unemployment rate last year also dropped to 2.1%, on the back of good performances of the job market and economy, and&nbsp;this is possibly one of the lowest in the world. More importantly, employment rate for older workers between 55 and 64 years old increased from 57% to 59%. In other words, because there were many job opportunities last year, those who had retired or are semi-retired were able to return to the workforce, and the whole economy became more vibrant.&nbsp; So workers enjoyed better bonuses last year.&nbsp;</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 2917<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will notice that all the newspapers, especially the <I>Straits Times</I>, are getting thicker and thicker. It is not because there are more news reports, no doubt there are a lot of photographs, but it is because there are many advertisements. There are many advertisements because purchasing power is very strong. There are also a lot of recruitment advertisements because many companies are looking for workers but have problems filling up vacancies.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, I went to Taiwan after a long lapse. I have a good impression of Taiwan because I picked up Mandarin from Taiwanese songs, media and books. I read novels about swordsmen by Louis Chia like \"Tian Long Ba Bu\" and some romance novels by Qiong Yao.&nbsp; When I went to Taiwan recently, I noticed that the pace of economic development has slowed down. It is a pity.&nbsp; In the early days when Chiang Kai Shek retreated with two million troops to Taiwan, many of them were members of the Chinese elite. There were entrepreneurs, there were university intellects.&nbsp; In the 1950s and 1960s, the pace of development in Taiwan was very rapid.&nbsp; On the contrary, Singapore was rather slow in development in those years, employment was a big problem.&nbsp; But in recent years, Taiwan has fallen behind in terms of the pace of development.&nbsp; In December, I read this magazine <I>Yuan Jian</I>. The cover story is a report on Singapore being number one, in terms of GDP growth, competitiveness and as the number one choice of many migrants. Many people may not be able to understand this because it is written in traditional Chinese characters but I am sure MP Low, having studied in Chinese schools, can understand the magazine.&nbsp; In the article, the representative of the Taiwan Representative Office in Singapore questioned why&nbsp;&ndash; in spite of&nbsp; a population of 23 million&nbsp;&ndash; Taiwan is unable to match up to Singapore, which has a population of five million.&nbsp; She said, in Taiwan's opinion, Singapore is not a small country <p align=left>Column: 2918<p>but a big country. These results are not just for show or display only.&nbsp; These are real results which have boosted our economy, created many job opportunities and helped to expand our economic pie, and because of this, wealth has grown. With wealth, we are able to solve the problems faced by our people. Our Government is here to solve these problems.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MP Low Thia Khiang, Secretary-General of the Workers' Party, suggested a series of measures, but these measures are misleading our Singaporean workers. Policies in Singapore definitely protect people in the lower-middle income group. Why? Because&nbsp; Singaporeans from the lower-middle income group form the majority of the electorate.&nbsp; If the Government does not defend the interest of the majority, how can the Government carry out its work?&nbsp; How can the Government maintain its stand and account for its actions to the people?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MP Low said that our 7% GST rate is too high and that it should be reduced.&nbsp; But he must consider, who has the ability to consume?&nbsp; Those with consumption power are in the upper-middle income group&nbsp;&ndash; people who buy cars and big houses, go for holidays and dine in five-star luxury hotels. They do not complain about the 7% GST because they enjoy the five-star treatment. In comparison, the lower-middle income group of Singaporeans goes to food centres and low-cost supermarkets.&nbsp; There is still a 7% GST but what they pay is much less than the outlay of the higher-income groups.&nbsp; So when the Government collects GST, most of it is spent for the benefit of the lower-income Singaporeans, in terms of education, ComCare Fund, and in various public assistance programmes.&nbsp; The beneficiaries are the lower-income group.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, in Singapore, the lower-income group does not pay income tax.&nbsp; Income tax is paid by the upper middle  <p align=left>Column: 2919<p> class.&nbsp; So our policies are designed to protect the interests of lower-income group, they are not designed to harm the interests of lower-income Singaporeans.&nbsp; If we lower GST, those who benefit are the rich Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp; The starting point of the Workers' Party does not defend the lower-income group. On the contrary, they are defending the interests of the higher-income group.&nbsp; I think this is the biggest mistake made by the Workers' Party.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, he said that there are too many foreign workers and they have taken away the rice bowls of Singaporeans.&nbsp; There are quite a lot of foreign workers because we have been developing rapidly and we do not have sufficient Singaporeans to do the jobs.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, if we want to grow and catch up with the economic pace of New York, Hong Kong and Shanghai, we must have more talents, more workers to meet these goals.&nbsp; Every company always starts off by looking for Singaporeans first.&nbsp; It is only when we cannot find Singaporeans, then the company will look for foreign workers and foreign talents.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, in our Town Councils&nbsp;&ndash; MP Low is also a chairman of one of these Town Councils&nbsp;&ndash; our contracts state that 70% of the workers must be Singaporeans, only 30% are foreigners.&nbsp; Under the terms of our landscaping contracts&nbsp;&ndash; the flower pruning, the grass cutting&nbsp;&ndash; we ensure that 50% of the workers are Singapore citizens and only 50% are foreign workers.&nbsp; It is because of these conditions and the terms of these contracts that our Town Council's General Manager says that our costs are 20% to 30% higher.&nbsp; Although we pay 20% or 30% higher costs, we have protected the interests of Singapore workers, it is worth it.&nbsp; If we do not have a group of foreign workers to cooperate with our Singapore workers, then I believe our Singapore city will not <p align=left>Column: 2920<p> be as beautiful, as well maintained.&nbsp; Foreign workers, in fact, do work that Singaporeans do not wish to do, work that is dirtier and where the working condition is harsher.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MP Low says that he hopes that the next Parliament will become a First World Parliament.&nbsp; I do not quite understand his definition or what he means.&nbsp; I believe our Parliament is a First World Parliament. What we debate here is not just empty talk.&nbsp; What we talk about and discuss are practical, realistic measures that can be implemented to effectively solve problems faced by our people.&nbsp; It is not about winning the debate.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he says that in Parliament, we must have more vigorous debate like the legislative assembly in Taiwan, I believe that is not a First World Parliament.&nbsp; I mention Taiwan again because the editor of this magazine asked the Taiwan Representative in Singapore to talk about the reason behind Singapore's success. Let me quote, \"Why is Singapore, a small country with a population of five million, able to attract twelve million tourists annually?&nbsp; Taiwan has a population of 23 million people in Taiwan, yet we can only attract four million to five million tourists annually.&nbsp; Obviously our geographical location, our scenic spots and tourist destinations have great potential, but their potential has not been fully developed. Why is that so? The reason is because whenever the ruling party wants to implement a policy, the opposition party will oppose&nbsp;&ndash; whether it is Kuomintang or the Democratic Progressive Party&nbsp;&ndash; whoever is in opposition will oppose; and that is pulling back the pace of development of Taiwan.\"</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, Singapore must avoid this type of so-called \"First World Parliament\".&nbsp; We must choose a wise government, and MPs who are accountable to the people.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inflation is a global issue of major concern.&nbsp; But our Government is capable.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2921<p>We have the talent, resources and financial resources. For example, our Singapore dollar has strong purchasing power and our inflation rate is lower than our neighbouring countries.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lower-income families say the electricity bill is high, so we have U-Save to help them.&nbsp; In Town Councils, service and conservancy charges are not high. In the recently announced Budget, the Government has announced a series of measures, with the Government paying the Town Council fees on their behalf.&nbsp; But, more importantly, it&nbsp;is the ComCare Fund.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under ComCare Fund, we have the means to target those who are really poor and help them solve various problems.&nbsp; For example, the children are poor and cannot go to a pre-school, we have ways to waive the fees, so that they can attend pre-school.&nbsp; There are various assistance programmes. Statistics may not be able to capture all these, which is why our Gini co-efficient index is relatively high, but because of this range of measures&nbsp;&ndash; which is not captured statistically&nbsp;&ndash; the poor in the country is not really very poor.&nbsp; I hope MP Low will look into and review these various aspects.&nbsp; His intentions may be good but the method of execution is wrong.<br></p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.55 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Audrey Wong Wai Yen (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Budget.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, I would like to thank the Government for sharing Singapore's surpluses with the people through measures such as Growth Dividends, Workfare Bonus, reduction in personal income tax, increased&nbsp;public assistance, child development funds and so on, which are certainly welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, this is <p align=left>Column: 2922<p>something few countries can afford today as they battle huge budget deficits.&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is fortunate that we are able to ride out the recession in a relatively short period of time and without too much hardship.&nbsp; This is also due to our strong fiscal policies.&nbsp; However, I understand from a number of public reactions that were reported in the press and from what I have heard on the streets, many Singaporeans seem to have expected more from this Budget.&nbsp; Indeed, Singaporeans have expressed that they have some concerns that are not alleviated by this Budget, particularly in addressing the long-term rising costs of living.&nbsp; Reactions are mixed from certain parts of the community.&nbsp; There is also the scepticism that this is a pre-election sweetener Budget.&nbsp; On the other hand, a large number of Singaporeans have expressed their satisfaction with this year's Budget.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The REACH portal's&nbsp;respondents are generally happy with the Budget.&nbsp; On the other hand, when I was reading online media coverage of the Finance Minister's Budget Statement, I was quite taken aback to see an online poll in the <I>Straits Times</I>.&nbsp; It attracted 1,740 respondents and quite a large proportion, 47%, indicated that the Budget definitely did not meet their expectations.&nbsp; This was in the immediate aftermath of the Speech.&nbsp; Of course, one should take into account the fact that many who post comments online are outspoken critics of the Government and would tend to be critical no matter what the Government does.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I was still surprised by this and wondered why this was so.&nbsp; I think this kind of dissatisfaction merits a closer look.&nbsp; The question that such responses beg is: are Singaporeans' expectations too high these days?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have two observations in relation to this.&nbsp; Firstly, Singaporeans' aspirations are indeed rising sky high very quickly.&nbsp; And<p align=left>Column: 2923<p>because the Government has actually met our aspirations so well, our expectations simply keep escalating.&nbsp; As our standard of living gets better, our expectations keep rising.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, these escalating aspirations are taking place against the backdrop of rising costs and the perception that while Singapore is becoming a more vibrant city and we are doing well economically, it is ironically also becoming more difficult to live here.&nbsp; The inflation figures perhaps bear out some of these sentiments.&nbsp; The inflation rate for last month was at its highest level in two years.&nbsp; Among other issues, the concerns of the sandwiched class are worth paying attention to.&nbsp; Middle-income earners are worried that they will not have enough for retirement and young people worry that they will be priced out of the housing market.&nbsp; I hear very often from my peers, and I agree with them, how much harder it is to save today than it was in the past.&nbsp; And I understand very well the situation of the sandwiched class because I myself am part of it.&nbsp; I need to stretch my income to support my household which includes my ageing parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is definitely essential for the Government to keep an eye on rising costs.&nbsp; There are implications on many other aspects of life in Singapore.&nbsp; For instance, costs could be a factor for married couples' decision whether or not to have children or to have one, two, three or more.&nbsp; It also affects the ordinary Singaporeans' capability to care for their ageing parents, and so on, and so forth.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also continue to alleviate the pressures on the lowest income group in our society and I believe this involves more than having schemes like ComCare, WorkFare, encouraging skills upgrading, and so on.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also ensuring that all Singaporeans have access to affordable healthcare, childcare, elderly care, transport, and daily necessities.&nbsp; Thus, a low-priced,<p align=left>Column: 2924<p>extensive, efficient&nbsp;public transport system, low-priced hawker centres and wet markets in housing estates should be considered essential amenities for public benefit.&nbsp; We should guard against handing over too many of these amenities to private hands&nbsp;although it makes business sense.&nbsp; That often leads to higher rents for stallholders and higher prices for the consumer and these simply add to the stress of living.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without doubt, the Government has provided magnificently well for the majority of Singaporeans.&nbsp; But, again, as they provide well for us, our expectations then just keep&nbsp;going higher.&nbsp; Take public housing, for instance.&nbsp; As Singaporeans come to expect more from their HDB flats, the HDB provided more varied types of housing, better landscaping, townships with all kinds of amenities and upgrading.&nbsp; We get benefits in many other areas too.&nbsp; As soon as a Singaporean is born, he receives money, starting&nbsp;with the&nbsp;Baby Bonus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans, however, are caught in a cycle of \"keeping up with the Joneses\" and this leads us to making more demands on the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp; We should be careful that we&nbsp;&ndash; both the people and Government&nbsp;&ndash; do not end up inadvertently creating a social compact which is based on mere transactional relationships.&nbsp; This kind of relationship does not promote social cohesion or inclusive growth.&nbsp; Our society must be bound by values and an ethos that goes beyond materialism.&nbsp; We should strive to be&nbsp;a society where civic consciousness prevails and where there is pride in being Singaporean.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, many Singaporeans are caught up in a consumerist pursuit of the 5C's.&nbsp; Having attained the 5Cs, they look for the \"upgraded\" 5Cs: not just a condo but a luxury home; not just a credit card but a platinum card, and so on.&nbsp; This has implications for our mission of making Singapore \"the best home for all\".&nbsp; A <p align=left>Column: 2925<p>home is not based on material things.&nbsp; So, we need to think about \"ensouling\" Singapore, enhancing the intangible aspects of life here that make it worth living.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, the Finance Minister's announcement of the additional $360 million for programme expenditure in arts and culture over the next five years is&nbsp;welcome news indeed.&nbsp; Arts and culture is part of&nbsp;the intangible assets of any society.&nbsp; For the past decade, artists and arts commentators have called on the Government to turn its attention to arts and cultural software development.&nbsp; Having&nbsp;buildings like the Esplanade, renovated the National Museum &ndash; and renovated beautifully, I might add &ndash; and now developing the National Art Gallery, the focus now is&nbsp;to turn to the content&nbsp;and, particularly, Singaporean content that will fill these buildings.&nbsp; This involves developing the talents who create the content and make it&nbsp;meaningful to the public because ultimately, what makes a global city tick is its heartbeat, which is founded on the soul of its people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, today, even&nbsp;among arts attendees, many approach arts with a consumerist mentality or&nbsp;a 5C's mentality: of acquisition, escapism and temporary relief from the stress of daily pursuit of material assets.&nbsp; If we are to be a global city with a soul, we should pay attention to our identity, to what roots us to this country, our heritage, our history, our literature, our values.&nbsp; Going further, it requires us to lose our apprehension of intellectual thinking and profundity, where \"<I>cheem</I>\" in Singapore's slang is a negative word.&nbsp; Without reflection, a city has no soul.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I quote the Victorian writer, Matthew Arnold, who argued the cause of education for all.&nbsp; This was in the 1800s.&nbsp; He said, \"Culture is a study of perfection, and perfection which insists on becoming something rather than in having <p align=left>Column: 2926<p>something, in an inward condition of the mind and spirit, not in an outward set of circumstances.\"&nbsp; We should aspire to culture as an inward quality&nbsp;&ndash; not simply to increase the number of arts&nbsp;and cultural activities but to enable Singaporeans to understand more fully the places that they come from, the stories of their predecessors, their reasons for being.&nbsp; I am happy to say that I believe we have already started on this path.&nbsp; Projects such as the National Heritage Board's Heritage Trails and Heritage Town initiatives, which involve the community, are steps in the right direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the question to ask and the question that the arts community has also been discussing, is how can additional funding for the arts be applied to the work of rooting culture among&nbsp;the people?&nbsp; To be honest, the artists I have spoken to are approaching the news of the additional funding with guarded optimism.&nbsp; Some are sceptical that things will improve, particularly for local artists, many of whom, including Cultural Medallion winners, are struggling to find affordable studio spaces&nbsp;or even housing, although they are already nearing retirement.&nbsp; There is a concern that&nbsp;additional funding and the arts will go towards international events like the recently-concluded art fair&nbsp;&ndash; Art Stage&nbsp;&ndash; or attracting more foreign productions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that one key strategy, in order to develop content and to root culture in us, is to invest in&nbsp;capacity-building &ndash; developing talents, giving them time and space to create artistic works, as well as to enable the enablers &ndash; the&nbsp;production and administrative people behind-the-scenes.&nbsp; This means adequately resourcing existing arts organisations so that they can run incubation and content development programmes over the medium and long term.&nbsp; Initiatives should be sustained as results in arts and culture do not occur overnight.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2927<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the creation of quality work requires two essential elements which&nbsp;so far have not been adequately supported by existing funding&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;that is, research and criticism.&nbsp;&nbsp;Research in the arts is not only carried out by academics: artists perform research into materials, methodologies and other aspects of the craft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Resourcing practitioners to do such research is important as well as resourcing more academic research in arts and cultural issues such as impact studies.&nbsp; Supporting and nurturing platforms for discussion of arts and cultural issues and practices are also important.&nbsp; With online media being such an important feature of life today, even for the literary arts which traditionally depended on print, one should reasonably expect MICA to resource online publications and nurture the development of critical platforms for the discussion of arts and culture.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another initiative I would like to suggest is to look more deeply into arts and education and community arts programmes.&nbsp; The next stage of our&nbsp;arts development will be about reaching more Singaporeans and getting them to participate in arts and cultural activities.&nbsp; We should, at such community programmes and arts education programmes,&nbsp;go beyond mere exposure to broader, cross-disciplinary approaches that enable students and the public to see arts and culture as part of a greater whole. And&nbsp;this means practitioners with&nbsp;knowledge of best practices and methodologies, the development of more sophisticated&nbsp;programmes, such as programmes in schools where the Arts is combined with other subject domains&nbsp;such as&nbsp;Physics, Chemistry or Geography.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective programmes require strong partnerships between the Government, people and private sectors.&nbsp; We need this partnership.&nbsp; I must commend the<p align=left>Column: 2928</p>Government for its efforts to develop private sponsorship.&nbsp; However, I would like to note that the rates of sponsorship in arts are not increasing at the same pace as the overall development of the sector.&nbsp; The figures for arts sponsorship&nbsp;&ndash; solely&nbsp;sponsorship for the arts&nbsp;which does not include heritage,&nbsp;as reported through the National Arts Council &ndash;&nbsp;do not make for encouraging reading.&nbsp; While arts activities quadrupled between 1997 and 2007, the amounts for arts sponsorship between 2000&nbsp;and 2008 remained fairly consistent at the $37 million mark annually.&nbsp; 2009, because of the recession,&nbsp;saw arts sponsorship falling drastically to $22 million.&nbsp; We cannot afford to just leave arts and cultural support&nbsp;to the Government alone &ndash; the private sector can come in to provide&nbsp;all kinds of support, including&nbsp;space for&nbsp;creation,&nbsp;programmes in corporate offices, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should look at developing more innovative corporate sponsorship practices.&nbsp; Better dialogue between Government, private and people sectors, that is, the practitioners and groups at community and professional level,&nbsp;is also needed in order to more fully develop the sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the wide-ranging support for the project of \"ensouling\" Singapore requires another important partner, that is, the media. It is widely acknowledged among arts practitioners that the coverage of arts and culture in the local media is currently inadequate.&nbsp; It does not do enough to provide the public with the means to develop a deeper appreciation of the arts.&nbsp; It is not a question about providing more coverage.&nbsp; It is also about analysis, reflection and a change in attitude towards arts and culture, to go beyond seeing them as luxury items or something for the elite to dabble in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Media discussion and coverage of local artists in a knowledgeable fashion would also foster recognition of Singapore's own artists and their contributions.&nbsp; Currently, even though<p align=left>Column: 2929</p>there has been a lot of publicity, a lot of buzz, about Singapore's art scene, few Singaporeans can name local artists even those who are successful in the international arena.&nbsp; Going to the online portal of our major news channels such as the <I>Straits Times</I> or <I>Channel News Asia</I>, one will find that there are no sections,&nbsp;separate tabs&nbsp;for arts and culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is subsumed under <I>Lifestyle</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe such a placement under <I>Lifestyle</I> entrenches a consumerist attitude towards culture.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;the <I>Lifestyle</I> section tends to be&nbsp;dominated by celebrity gossip, and not only local celebrity gossip but Hollywood gossip, Taiwan&nbsp;entertainment scenes, and so on.&nbsp; This&nbsp;encourages the public to associate <I>Lifestyle</I> with the frivolous or disposable.&nbsp; I was also very interested when I was reading the online coverage of the Budget speech that there was no discussion of the increase in funding for arts and culture on the same evening, although there was a lot written about many other initiatives that were unveiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this&nbsp;subtly reveals a certain&nbsp;attitude&nbsp;in our&nbsp;media.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One suggestion that some people in&nbsp;the arts community have proposed is to&nbsp;consider guidelines to increase the proportion of local arts content in our media &ndash; for radio to play more local music,&nbsp;television to produce more local and arts-related programmes, cinemas to show a proportion of locally-made films, and even&nbsp;the museums to include a percentage of local works and artists in their annual programmes.&nbsp; This might foster pride in our own cultural offerings.&nbsp; We might learn some lessons from the Korean experience here.&nbsp; One of the commonly cited reasons for the rise of the Korean pop culture wave was actually the government's committed support for made-in-Korea content.&nbsp; I look forward to the day when we have a Singaporean wave going out into the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2930</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to more details from the MICA Minister for the new initiatives for arts and culture going forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to conclude, the Singapore Government has provided well for the people.&nbsp; The&nbsp;sound financial policies means that the majority of Singaporeans will benefit from the Budget this year.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are certainly still areas for debate which other Members of the House have already raised:&nbsp;how to increase&nbsp;productivity levels and&nbsp;reduce dependence on foreign workers&nbsp;&ndash; just to name two ongoing long-term issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dissatisfaction expressed by ordinary Singaporeans so far, I believe, is a question of our expectations and aspirations.&nbsp; We need to guard against creating a social compact that is&nbsp;just transactional.&nbsp; Rather,&nbsp;our project in the coming years should include that of \"ensouling\" ourselves in order to realise the aspiration of the \"best home for all'.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>4.14 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B> Sir, I commend the Government on returning to a position of fiscal surplus in Financial Year 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to the Budget debate, I salute the Government for a very carefully crafted Budget which gives something to everyone.&nbsp; It is definitely not an election Budget as Mr Low Thia Khiang calls it. To me, it is&nbsp;far more than a <I>hongbao</I> Budget, because a <I>hongbao</I> suggests a show of largesse by the Government.&nbsp; A <I>hongbao</I> suggests that the Government is giving away money because it has money.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, I would call this a caring Budget because its details show the attention the Government has devoted to ensuring that the Budget encompasses everyone.&nbsp; This Budget is not just about&nbsp;giving away goodies.&nbsp; It provides for everyone sharing in the country&rsquo;s success in a focused way.&nbsp; This Budget provides for the entire cross-section of the population from the young to the aged, and from special-needs children to the elderly who need long-term care.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Budget promotes inclusive growth.&nbsp; It hands out not only short-term grants but also extends help for Singaporeans to move up the income ladder over the long term.&nbsp; In particular, I would like to highlight that when we aggregate the new Children Development Credit scheme, top-ups to school committee funds and other existing educational grants and bursaries for students, education in Singapore is almost free.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while this is a pro-people Budget, I would like to suggest though that more can be done for an important but silent segment of our society.&nbsp; This group comprises housewives or house husbands who are the rock on whom families depend.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to propose an initiative that can be called Homemakers&rsquo; Enterprise.&nbsp; Under this, the working spouse pays the other spouse who stays home to <p align=left>Column: 2932</p>mind the children.&nbsp; Homemakers can then declare the pay received and claim tax breaks under this enterprise.&nbsp; Naturally, if their monthly pay is less than the Workfare income ceiling, the homemakers, like the self-employed, should be entitled to bonuses or additional credits under the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Couples can opt for this Homemakers&rsquo; Enterprise or for the existing spouse relief of $2,000, whichever gives them a better overall fiscal position.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, the Government could provide a top-up directly to the homemaker, with the amount linked to the number of children the homemaker looks after, until the kids reach the age of 16 years old.&nbsp; This would recognise what the homemaker has given up&nbsp;&ndash; which in some cases could be a high-paying job&nbsp;&ndash; to perform National Service.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children are precious resources in Singapore.&nbsp; Having them and ensuring that they are brought up well is performing extended service for the nation &ndash; with an Operationally-ready Date (ORD) that is 16 years and more into the future.&nbsp; Yes, it could take at least 16 years before the stay-at-home spouse is \"operationally ready\" to re-enter the workforce.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another group of people in Singapore for whom more help can be given is the sandwiched class.&nbsp; The Government has generously announced tax rebates for those who earn more than $20,000 a year and, at the same time, raised the CPF salary ceiling to $5,000.&nbsp; These changes will make a big difference to the sandwiched class.&nbsp; Yet, I wonder what else can be done for this class, particularly, as those who are not working will not be able to benefit from salary-linked breaks.&nbsp; One example is to link the foreign maid levy relief to household income.&nbsp; This relief should be gender-neutral and be extended to male <p align=left>Column: 2933</p>taxpayers with a non-working wife and dependant children.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is to grant incentives to motivate employers to hire citizens aged over 45 who are currently unemployed but who, if employed, would enjoy a pay which does not qualify them for Workfare.&nbsp; This group of citizens might have dropped out of the workforce to look after their children and subsequently face difficulty in securing a job because of their age.&nbsp; Their skills and previous working experience would be relevant to the economy, particularly now when manpower is tight.&nbsp; Therefore, I am happy that the Government is providing enhanced training support for PMETs by improving the capacity and quality of Continuing Education and Training (CET) programmes and making it more affordable for PMETs who wish to upgrade or obtain new skills.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I propose that a further step can be taken in that the Government can match middle-aged or older citizens, who are seeking a job, to employers who need manpower. This function can be performed seamlessly by the Community Development Councils (CDCs).&nbsp; This is because the CDCs were tasked during the last economic downturn to help those who had lost their jobs to find new employment.&nbsp; With the economy now booming again, fewer are seeking the help of the CDCs, whose attention can now be shifted to older citizens&nbsp;&ndash; PMETs or otherwise.&nbsp;<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I&nbsp;believe that the current tight labour conditions offer the best opportunity&nbsp;to&nbsp;start taking concrete action to help older citizens who wish to continue working.&nbsp; As the population ages, this issue will only grow more urgent.&nbsp; While Singapore recently amended the law to increase the retirement age, it has to be emphasised that older workers who are unemployed are not covered by the new Retirement and Re-employment Act.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 2934</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the process of helping older workers secure employment, Singapore will learn too how to manage an older workforce. And there will be spin-offs.&nbsp; The expertise we gain in managing older employees can be exported.&nbsp; On the intangible side, the mental stimulation which work provides may help Singaporeans maintain cognitive health.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government has set&nbsp;the bar high when it says that it aims to raise incomes by 30% in real terms over this decade.&nbsp; When I heard the Finance Minister announce the 30% goal, inwardly, I could hear groans from businessmen.&nbsp; Their concern would be that this target might stir unrealistic pay expectations among Singaporeans and drive up costs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Singaporeans will see that the regimen is going to be very different now because the Government has outlined how we can leap over the bar.&nbsp; Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in his Budget Speech said: \"We can only achieve this if we grow our economy, upgrade our businesses and invest in raising skills, craftsmanship and the quality of service in every job.\"<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is putting money where its mouth is.&nbsp; It is increasing support significantly for companies to invest in workers&rsquo; skills and productivity and to help Singaporeans upgrade.&nbsp; For instance, the Government will raise subsidies for Singaporean adults who pursue their first degree or diploma on a part-time basis at any of the polytechnics, universities or CET centres.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans should also note that the Government plans to cut reliance on foreign manpower. All these moves will benefit Singaporeans because the workforce is going to be very tight.&nbsp; This means that employers will have to offer more attractive benefits to woo <p align=left>Column: 2935</p>employees, like higher pay, improve healthcare plans and a better work-life balance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this mean that manna will be falling from the sky? No, Singaporeans understand that there is no such thing as a free lunch.&nbsp; On their part, they must seize the day and apply themselves. Otherwise, the upward pressure on manpower costs will drive employers overseas.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Singaporeans may think the current drive to push up incomes is <I>deja vu</I> for them.&nbsp; They may think it is similar to the prelude to 1985.&nbsp; They question Singapore&rsquo;s commitment to productivity.&nbsp; One middle-aged executive I am acquainted with who went through the 1985 economic downturn&nbsp;&ndash; which was an experience she hoped she would never have to face again &ndash; told me that she had been at a loss as to what to think about the influx of foreign workers in recent years.&nbsp; She said that this went against every grain of what she had been led to believe about productivity drive in Singapore.&nbsp; She said that she started doubting the Government for its messages about productivity which conflicted with actions allowing in more foreign workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while I am somewhat concerned too that we might see a repeat of 1985 when Singapore tumbled into a recession because of escalated manpower costs, I would say that, by leaps and bounds, I am more confident instead that the outcome this time would be different from that in the mid-1980s.&nbsp;Why? Because the starting point this time is productivity gains, with wage increases to follow.&nbsp; This is unlike in the '80s when higher wages were not accompanied by higher productivity.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has steeled its resolve to raise productivity and this is <p align=left>Column: 2936</p>evident from the comments made by several Ministers since the Budget address. &nbsp;For instance, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said on 22nd February that there would be no turning back on the policy, unlike in the past, when the Government relaxed the entry of foreign workers.&nbsp; He said: \"This time, we cannot make a U-turn. This time, we cannot relax.\" Singaporeans, too, should rise up and ensure that there is no U-turn in the productivity drive.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies play a crucial role here. But what is productivity? What is the baseline or reference point?&nbsp; As I mentioned in last year&rsquo;s Budget debate, in its basic definition, productivity is about more output and fewer resources.&nbsp; Productivity can be increased through automation, mechanisation and streamlining work processes and even re-designing the workplace layout.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These all read well on paper, but what do we actually have to do to attain the 30% real income growth?&nbsp; The Minister of State for Trade and Industry Mr Lee Yi Shyan said on 16th February&nbsp;that the challenge for most SMEs was &ndash; and I quote from&nbsp;the <I>Straits Times</I> &ndash; \"not one of lacking of will but not knowing how to upgrade, innovate and improve productivity.\"</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The productivity drive is a journey which requires drivers in several lanes to move forward at the same time.&nbsp; This means that the public sector itself, which is the largest employer in Singapore, has to increase productivity too.&nbsp; The Government may even have to wear the hat of a coach to teach SMEs how they can go about improving productivity.&nbsp; Targeted coaching clinics may have to be held.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this respect, I am glad to hear that the Government is supporting the construction firms with the Construction Productivity Roadmap.&nbsp; What is there for <p align=left>Column: 2937</p>the retail and catering sectors where the scope for productivity gains is regarded to be huge?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In working towards higher productivity, we need to ascertain whether and how much we are on track.&nbsp; Businesses will need to put in place yardsticks and the means to assess actual progress.&nbsp; Do businesses know how to do this effectively?&nbsp; For instance, how do employers measure the change in performance of those who have undergone training?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More so, how will the Government get employers to supply productivity data so that we know we have not gone off tangent? Companies already squeezed for manpower need to expend resources to gather statistics.&nbsp; I urge the Government to consider providing an incentive to motivate companies to collate and report productivity data.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, while I am happy to note that the Government will double the size of the National Productivity Fund to $2 billion, what has been the effectiveness of the fund since it was introduced last year?&nbsp; How is the effectiveness measured?&nbsp; In addition, how does the Government plan to measure the effectiveness of extending the Productivity&nbsp;and Innovation Credit for expenditure on R&amp;D done abroad and ensure that this liberal scheme would not be abused?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some business people I have met say that the progressive increase in foreign worker levies is being introduced at too fast a pace.&nbsp; SMEs, especially, will need more time to wean themselves off their dependence on foreign workers.&nbsp; This is especially so as it was not so long ago that the Government had been relaxed about letting in foreign manpower.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Government has said that the levy increases will weed out weaker <p align=left>Column: 2938</p>companies, I advocate that before we let some firms fall off the cliff, we should make an attempt to pull them back from the edge because some may be worth saving.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compounding their difficulties, some SMEs say that it is difficult for them to take advantage of the PIC scheme because they do not have the critical mass to embark on automation.&nbsp; For such SMEs, it is important to focus on re-design, training and shifting the mindset of workers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in this regard, I sense that the PIC scheme is stuck at the consulting stage.&nbsp; Consulting firms &ndash; which themselves are SMEs &ndash; are tasked with helping businesses improve productivity.&nbsp; But the road to offering advice is paved with obstacles.&nbsp; The consultants have to first market their services and perform business diagnostics to get a picture of their clients&rsquo; operations before they actually get down to proffering advice.&nbsp; This preliminary work requires resources.&nbsp; In other words, the consulting firms need start-up support before they can help SMES.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many Singaporeans see this Budget as one which will drive costs up.&nbsp; The half a percentage point increase in employers&rsquo; CPF contributions, the raising of the CPF salary ceiling and the hikes in foreign worker levies are a burden on companies, especially SMEs.&nbsp; Just as our businessmen are rubbing their hands in glee,&nbsp;believing that they can start counting the profits that are rolling in now that the good times are back,&nbsp;they are slammed by these increased costs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Granted, the Budget offers greater tax deductions and new rebates to businesses, but there is little in it that helps smaller companies deal with costs above the before tax line.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, as the Finance Minister has acknowledged, SMEs may not benefit fully from the <p align=left>Column: 2939</p>corporate tax rebate.&nbsp; While the Budget proposes that SMEs can claim a cash grant of up to $5,000 in lieu of the tax rebate, the Government can consider offering a higher grant to help SMES.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I acknowledge, too, the generous grants and rebates offered to individuals and households.&nbsp; But, again, there is not much in the Budget that addresses the underlying costs.&nbsp; For instance, while the Government will provide a special CPF Housing Grant to help low-income families own their homes, what is the HDB doing to lower the costs of new flats?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has said that the proposed hikes in foreign worker levies are a signal to businesses to take productivity seriously.&nbsp; It says that the increases are not an attempt to get employers to substitute local employees for foreign workers.&nbsp; Nevertheless, some employers will make attempts at substitution.&nbsp; Those who do so are likely to bemoan the fact that they cannot find Singaporeans to fill the openings.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

It could not&nbsp;have been easy for Mr Tharman to come up with a Budget that touches the full spectrum of society and he has pushed the boundaries of&nbsp;creativity to its limits to ensure that everyone has a stake in our recent economic success.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, we are fortunate to be able to respond from a strong position to the challenges that confront our young nation.&nbsp; In terms of planning, however, we must cast our vision forward to identify pillars <p align=left>Column: 2941</p>and foundations to strengthen so that we continue to stand strong when favourable conditions take a turn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to highlight three additional areas where more resources can be further focused to lay the foundation for an inclusive future for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; To work in our Government's commitment to an inclusive society for our future generations, I firmly urge this House to consider more to be done for:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp; low-income families in distress;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp; low-wage workers from the lower-middle income groups; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii)&nbsp; holistic talent development that goes beyond academic achievements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first touch on low-income families in distress.&nbsp; As a Government, I think we have done a good job in providing for our residents in the bottom 20% of the income ladder.&nbsp; I know this for a fact, from the work that MCYS and our Community Development Councils (CDCs) have done to ensure our affected residents received urgent help during the 2008/2009 recessions when the number of help-seekers increased by 40%.&nbsp; The ComCare Assistance Schemes are well-thought through and ensure that the generally needy receive help for life's basic necessities like&nbsp;housing, food and education.&nbsp; I am confident, Sir, that the Government certainly can and will do more on this fund.&nbsp; But should we do everything?&nbsp; I strongly believe that community must play a role in helping itself and caring for its less able members. There is something very different when society helps itself and individuals want to help others.&nbsp; It is a whole different type of care, of compassion and even of expertise that is involved.&nbsp; At the Central Singapore CDC, this is what keeps us up at night -- identifying resources, bringing people together and then igniting a common <p align=left>Column: 2942</p>passion to benefit the community at large.&nbsp; Our community is more inclusive when an under-privileged child bonds with a volunteer banker through a weekend outing in our Nurture Programme.&nbsp; Our district is more compassionate when junior college students make monthly visits to befriend lonely elderly residents once a month in our Bright Homes&nbsp;Programme.&nbsp; Our society is more tolerant when children plan an afternoon interacting with different races and cultures as part of the Orange Ribbon&nbsp;celebration on racial harmony.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can put money into&nbsp;hands of the needy people and organise events.&nbsp; But can we achieve genuine inclusivity without the support and participation of a larger community?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United Kingdom, Sir, Mr David Cameron&nbsp;is making a big deal of \"Big Society\" which his opponents dismiss as an excuse to cut government expenditure.&nbsp; We, in Singapore, are in a unique and enviable position to construct a genuinely Big Society without compromising on the Government's provisions for the most needy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tharman has spoken about before on the need to \"crowd in\" the community as a pillar for constructing an inclusive society.&nbsp; This is precisely what the five CDCs have been concentrating our efforts on with a 23% increase&nbsp;in our community engagement, with community participation in CDCs' programmes crossing the one-million mark for the first time.&nbsp; More than 10,000 active volunteers planned, organised and implemented some 220 volunteer-initiated community projects.&nbsp; The CDCs collaborated with some 1,700 community and corporate partners in 2010 to facilitate the more able helping the less able.&nbsp; Some $10.4 million was attracted in corporate donations, up from $8.5 million in 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these have been done, Sir, within the CDCs' project budget that has<p align=left>Column: 2943</p>remained unchanged for most of the last decade.&nbsp; I would like, Sir, to propose more resources to facilitate community-led programmes that would strengthen&nbsp;the local network of neighbourhood and family to offer more direct intimate assistance to those in need.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent price hikes and inflationary concerns are a case in point.&nbsp; While we know that lower and lower-middle income families feel the pain of increased prices, we also know that most will be reluctant to come forward for help in keeping with our traditional Asian values of self-reliance.&nbsp; Most will try to fend for themselves but this will put further pressure on many already fragile families.&nbsp; Stronger neighbourhood networks and better resource community agencies will allow for deeper outreach to deliver targeted help to support&nbsp;distressed families in the form of social services like child care, family support and community help.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now touch on the low-wage workers.&nbsp; To further strengthen&nbsp;the foundation of an inclusive future, we need to ensure that more is done for the low-wage workers who are the backbone of the economy.&nbsp; Every economy, no matter how sophisticated, needs our own drivers, cleaners, gardeners and cooks, to keep things going smoothly.&nbsp; Foreign labour cannot be the answer to everything as they will leave when things are better elsewhere, leaving us with a gaping hole to plug.&nbsp; With globalisation, our low-wage workers are in an extremely vulnerable position as their wages are effectively being set in the developing world's labour market dominated&nbsp;by China and India.&nbsp; They are locked into a deadly cycle of low-pay, low status, and low-prospects employment.&nbsp; If left unchecked, this will create an under-class which is permanently excluded from the vibrant mainstream economy.&nbsp; We need to <p align=left>Column: 2944</p>continue to provide relevant training, skills upgrading and give our low-wage the recognition that they deserve in responsibility and remuneration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To create such pathways of improvement for our low-wage workers, we need to further improve the Workfare Training Support scheme and ensure that it effectively complements the Workfare Income Supplement scheme.&nbsp; While training is a serious business, we need to be realistic about&nbsp;the obstacles that the low-wage workers face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to share a successful case managed by the CDC recently, not to celebrate but more to highlight the difficulties involved in moving to a better job.&nbsp; Thirty-three-year-old Mr Ain Harizan is the sole breadwinner supporting his aged single mother. He came to see&nbsp;us in November 2009, seeking help for an improvement in his $1,000 a month job as a security guard where work was mundane&nbsp;and hours were long.&nbsp; Our career consultants assessed that he could do better in the tourism and retail industry and worked out an action plan for him to obtain a WSQ Diploma in Tourism, specialising in MICE, a mission that was anything but easy.&nbsp; Before the course commenced in March last year, Ain had to quit his job and enrol in three preparatory courses under the Employability Skills System (ESS).&nbsp; As part of the transition process, Ain&nbsp;took up a part-time job at $6 per hour as a sales assistant, attending the Diploma classes from 7.00 pm to 10.00 pm daily for six months.&nbsp; Upon graduation, he managed to find a job in October 2009 as a service crew earning $1,300.&nbsp; Not satisfied, he continued to upgrade himself with basic IT skills and proudly called us to inform us earlier this year that he is working at Marina Bay Sands as a butler with a pay of $1,900.&nbsp; This is a year-and-a-half after his journey started with us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tell this story as a cautionary one.&nbsp; For every one Ain Harizan we produce, <p align=left>Column: 2945</p>we have seven to eight low-wage workers who do not complete their journey for better employment.&nbsp; This is an intelligent, resourceful and capable young man but he himself wanted to give up at many points.&nbsp; Our consultants recognised his potential and persisted&nbsp;to spur him on.&nbsp; For his subsistence, he was given help with the Skills Advancement Allowance (S2A) scheme.&nbsp; We even had to negotiate hard for the heavily subsidised training course to be paid in two instalments of $50.&nbsp; Ain's journey was a long and painful one but there are many who face even more obstacles than him.&nbsp; Imagine an older low-wage worker who has no family members to support.&nbsp; Would she be able to sustain the sacrifices involved in upgrading her employment situation?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we move into a post-recession economic landscape, we need to adjust our policies to better equip our low-wage citizens to make the jump before they are caught up in the low-pay, low-status spiral.&nbsp; We need more effective incentives to cushion the opportunity cost for training and more resources put into mentorship by trained career consultants who can help workers keep pace in their upgrading journey.&nbsp; The current low take-up rates for WTS show that more must be done on these fronts in order to genuinely change&nbsp;the lives of our low-wage workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we need to be wary of creating a permanent under class, we must also guard against entrenching a permanent upper class.&nbsp; Therefore, the final part of my response for creating an inclusive future involves widening our definition of success to recognise and develop talents in a broader range of endeavours and to channel the necessary resources to achieve these thrusts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's traditional emphasis on academic attainment has served us very well and must remain a cornerstone of our policy for economic growth.&nbsp; To that end, <p align=left>Column: 2946</p>I more than welcome the additional resources being allocated to research and development as this is an essential for innovation that will fuel our future growth engines.&nbsp; We cannot, however, be a nation of rocket scientists.&nbsp; It is neither realistic nor practical.&nbsp; While meritocracy must be our key governing principle, I am concerned that an over-emphasis on the value of academic abilities translates into a disproportionate level of rewards for those who achieve and excel in the traditional ways.&nbsp; Over generations, this creates an incentives system that will entrench an upper class of well-schooled professionals who will become increasingly detached from society and the real lives of their fellow citizens.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no question, Sir, about the different roles to be played by all members of the community.&nbsp; What needs to be equalised is the value we place on these roles and occupations and the resources we devote to nurturing our young to excel in other non-academic fields. &nbsp;For a society to be genuinely inclusive, we need to have a flourishing arts and literary scene, a vibrant sporting culture and strong creative industries, all anchored by local talent.&nbsp; I believe that this is not only inclusive but effective as a strategy for economic diversification.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where do we start to build and diversify our talent base?&nbsp; We can articulate these ideas at the top but real change needs to happen at the level of the community.&nbsp; We need to have more resources put into strengthening performing platforms and culture at the community level and building of capabilities in the fine arts.&nbsp; We need more opportunities for supporting past-times in order for our children to develop competence at a younger age.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

More importantly, Sir, fostering an elite that comes from a multi-disciplinary background provides a diversity of perspectives that help to inform our decision-making at the leadership level.&nbsp; This will allow us to respond more effectively to the multi-faceted challenges that global developments toss up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we are serious about inclusivity at the upper end of the social spectrum, then we need a properly set out framework with corresponding resources to diversify our talent development in the same way we are pushing for advances in&nbsp;science and technology.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to conclude by reiterating my original argument that inclusivity must be built into our future policies and governing infrastructure.&nbsp; We need to create more supporting structures to foster capability building and social mobility at both ends of the social spectrum.&nbsp; Community is an important resource that needs to be harnessed to ensure our safety net is genuinely tight for those in need.&nbsp; We can do more to ensure that our low-wage workers are supported in their quest for higher quality jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

With that, Sir, I support the Budget.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.46 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> Sir, the 2011 annual Budget is relevant, inclusive and balanced. I commend the Minister for Finance and his team for putting it together. The comprehensive slew of both one-time and other more<p align=left>Column: 2948</p>permanent fiscal measures pressed most of the hot buttons of the day. The measures brought joy and cheer to many residents to whom I recited the list of measures.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This annual Budget is relevant. Of immediate relevance is the \"Growth and Share\" Package comprising $3.2 billion worth of counter-inflation benefits such as utility and conservancy charge rebates, growth dividends and personal income tax relief. It squarely addresses the nagging worry of&nbsp;low and average Singaporeans including the sandwiched generation who watches over both their elderly parents and their young children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The increase in Public Assistance (PA) and the permanent removal of the TV and radio licence fees were proactive measures that are welcomed by both PA and non-PA recipients. The removal of the licence fees was beyond my expectation and I am glad that the days of appealing for waivers from the&nbsp;Minister&nbsp;for Information, Communications and the Arts for my needy residents are over.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am thankful that the Minister has listened closely to suggestions to improve the cashflow problems of the low-wage workers at a time of rising cost of living. The increase of workfare quantum by 50% this year and payment of the entire increase in cash is proof that the Government empathises with the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This 2011 annual Budget is also inclusive as it covers a wide spectrum of Singaporeans across the economic strata. I am very pleased that for the first time during my term in this House, I hear special schools mentioned directly in the main Budget speech, and in almost the same breath when the Minister spoke about mainstream students. It shows that the non-mainstream students educated by charities are now on the national radar and I thank the Government for that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2949</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, this Budget is balanced in scope. I am glad the ruling Government did not fully succumb to the pre-election fever virus and ignore the need to provide for longer-term social and economic investments. That this regime returned $4 billion that was drawn from the national reserves in the last recession for future use is testament to its prudence and sense of responsibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let us also not take for granted that Singapore had recovered fully from the last crisis faster than most Asian countries, the United States, Europe and Japan. Our Government&rsquo;s swift and bold interventions in the form of Jobs Credits, SPUR and Special Risk-Sharing Initiative (SRI)&nbsp;loan guarantees were deliberate,&nbsp;effective and won accolades both locally and globally.&nbsp; I commend the Minister for Finance, his team and the rest of the Government for putting together this relevant, inclusive and balanced Budget; and for steering Singapore out of the last economic downturn so ably.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to bring up&nbsp;three key points for the&nbsp;Government&rsquo;s consideration and response:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;to assess how Singapore has emerged from the last economic downturn and our readiness for the next one;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;to caution the Government on the potential addiction to easy gaming revenue; and</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;to seek alternative drive engines and beware of the risk of riding on the same bandwagon as other economies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore&rsquo;s readiness for the next economic downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Paul Romer, the Stanford University economist who was once named by <I>TIME</I> magazine as one of America&rsquo;s 25 most influential people is often credited with the quote, \"A crisis is a terrible thing to waste\". This quote, \"A crisis is a terrible thing to waste\" became<p align=left>Column: 2950</p>a sounding horn by economists worldwide to seriously garner lessons from the 2007-2009 economic downturn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even as we congratulate ourselves for emerging from the last crisis almost unscathed, I am concerned about how ready we are for the next one. Have our workforce and our SMEs really&nbsp;emerged stronger from the slew of Government-funded rescue packages in 2007/2008? Or have we learnt that when push comes to shove, the Government will always be there to underwrite all and sundry by drawing down national reserves and generating highly popular schemes, such as the&nbsp;Jobs Credit Scheme?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I urge the Government to carefully study the factors that will increase our readiness quotient in the next economic downturn. I hope that we do not become a victim of our own success and emerge, in reality, weaker, rather than stronger from the last crisis. Yes, the Government is voted in to lead the country but for survival, every worker and every business must take proactive action to prepare ourselves for the next crisis. I especially encourage leaders in all&nbsp;three sectors&nbsp;&ndash; public, private and even the people sector &ndash;&nbsp;to look into the numerous programmes that MTI and agencies, such as SPRING, have developed to raise local company capabilities and productivity.&nbsp; If the programmes are not relevant, have the courage to give the agencies constructive feedback. &nbsp;If they are relevant, we owe it to ourselves to take action or we would have been none the better and, as Paul Romer said, would have wasted precious lessons from the crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in this regard, I seek the Minister&rsquo;s analysis of what he thought were the important lessons we have learnt from the economic downturn of 2007-2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Potential addiction to easy gaming revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second point I wish to talk about relates to my deep concern <p align=left>Column: 2951</p>about our potential addiction to easy gaming casino revenue.&nbsp; Some may ask what have this&nbsp;got to do with the Budget.&nbsp;And, in fact,&nbsp;some people have advised me that the debate on casinos in Singapore is already&nbsp;over and it&nbsp;should not be brought up again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have studied carefully the extensive debate in early 2005 when the proposal to build the&nbsp;two Integrated Resorts&nbsp;(IRs) with the casino component was voted on in this House. It has been more than five years and new data and information have emerged.&nbsp; Singapore is on its way to become a top gaming industry player. According to the <I>Straits Times</I> in December 2010, Singapore is fast becoming the second largest gaming earner in the whole of Asia Pacific, second only to Macau.&nbsp; Marina Bay Sands&rsquo; parent company, Las Vegas Sands, is reported to expect Singapore to outdo its Las Vegas casino by 2012.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently in February 2011, CNBC reported that the revenue from the Resorts World Theme Park only makes up 10% of Resorts World's overall revenue. As we expect, the real cash cow is the casino. CNBC also reported that including rival Marina Bay Sands, Singapore's gaming market will reach US$5 billion in 2011. And listen to this&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Las Vegas' entire gaming industry is only US$6 billion. Consultancy PWC has estimated that by 2014, Singapore&rsquo;s slice of the global gaming industry is as big as US$8.3 billion out of US$156.8 billion.&nbsp; Demand is so strong that&nbsp;last week, Marina Bay Sands (MBS)&nbsp;announced that it is seeking more land from the Singapore Government to expand its meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) operations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the very strong economic showing by the casino industry in Singapore&nbsp;has taken many of us aback.&nbsp; Proponents <p align=left>Column: 2952</p>argue that the Integrated Resorts and the casinos were key in achieving the record of 11.6 million in visitor arrivals and $18.8 billion in tourism dollars. &nbsp;However, Sir, if we study the numbers carefully, we would know that a record of 10.3 million in visitor arrivals was already achieved in 2007 even before the IRs were completed. Similarly, the previous record of $15.5 billion in tourism dollars was set in 2008 before the IRs were completed. These achievements before the IRs were started weaken the arguments for the building of the casinos where 2002&rsquo;s much lower figures were cited in argument for the casinos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I bring up the topic of gaming revenue not to question the decision of 2005. Hindsight, as we all know, is always 20/20.&nbsp; My intent is to urge Government not to be tempted by the glitter of the gaming industry and to consider taking the more difficult journey of honing our own expertise in building quality tourism products. There are&nbsp;two reasons for this &ndash; to strengthen our economy and to strengthen our society &ndash; the very same reasons underpinning this year&rsquo;s annual Budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, strengthening our economy.&nbsp; Sir, Singapore&rsquo;s embrace of the gaming industry and its apparent success have emboldened other governments to reconsider their stance to join in the gaming&nbsp;competition. I hear that Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, China, India and even nearby Bintan, Indonesia, are potential candidates in the gaming industry.&nbsp; With their natural, usually more beautiful,&nbsp;habitats and potentially more liberal regulatory frameworks, it is likely that our lead will be eroded and gaming is unlikely to help us sustain economic growth in the long term for Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Sir, for Singapore&rsquo;s economy to truly benefit from the price we pay for admitting the casinos, we must learn the trade of building more<p align=left>Column: 2953</p>quality tourism products ourselves. We should design our next step to provide opportunities for our local corporations, the big ones and the SMEs, to learn to build and run world-class MICE and leisure-entertainment resorts ourselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, strengthening our society. Sir, many of us know the dark side of problem gambling and organised crime that are associated with the gaming industry worldwide. There is growing evidence that debts arising from local gambling activities are already increasing, and I hear social gamblers are said to be enticed with additional gambling chips to gamble both here in Singapore and at casinos in the operators'&nbsp;regional network, eg, Genting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not repeat too often the official Government's reply that \"it is too early to tell the full extent of the social impact that casinos are having on Singapore\".&nbsp; Research tells us that the negative impact of casinos on its neighbouring vicinity is usually felt after a period of about&nbsp;three years. Singapore&rsquo;s small geographic size adds to the risk of both higher social and security ills. We are not a Macau which is populated mostly by foreigners. The proximity of the casinos in our midst is a social risk that must be watched closely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I know it is futile to question why Singapore decided to build&nbsp;the&nbsp;two IRs with the casinos&nbsp;in 2005. There were good intentions and&nbsp;perhaps&nbsp;even good reasons for that decision. &nbsp;But&nbsp;whilst we may not be able to change the decisions we have made in the past, we can shape&nbsp;our future by refusing to build a third casino if the appeal ever comes up and to rethink our economic strategy relating to the gaming industry for the simple reason&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;all that glitters is not gold.&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Government to:<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;not consider, if it ever comes up, MBS&rsquo; request for more land; and if indeed there is a demand for MICE and leisure facilities, to offer that land and that <p align=left>Column: 2954</p>facility&nbsp;to local groups so that we can learn to develop world-class expertise, systems and management in these service industries;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;stop at two casinos in Singapore. For casinos, stop at two. Unlike babies, casinos strengthen neither&nbsp;economy or society. Let us put a lid on this industry whilst easy gaming revenue is still small and let us not let it grow so large that we become dependent on it for even our social services and it becomes impossible to give up;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;increase the per-entry levy to the existing casinos by&nbsp;three times, making it not so attractive for casual or social gamblers to go there; and</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;abolish the annual levy to discourage the urge by visitors&nbsp;to spread cost by higher-visit frequency.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least,&nbsp;alternate economic drive engines and being aware of the risk of riding on the same bandwagon as other economies. &nbsp;I am fully aware that it is one thing to say we should limit gaming as a source of revenue but it is another to suggest there are other similarly easy ways to make money.&nbsp; There are none.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as I look at the list of strategic business sectors that Singapore is investing in, for example, biomedical, finance, commodity, maritime, green technology and so forth, I cannot help but note that other countries are also eyeing the same sectors.&nbsp; Even US President Barack Obama mentioned some similar industries such as clean technology and biotechnology in his 2011 State of the Union address.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The billion-dollar question then is &ndash; which will be the winner and what growth engines should we develop for sustainable economic growth if we drop softer options like gambling or gaming?<br>&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 2955</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to suggest to the Minister, to Government, to consider the idea that management guru Tom Peters recently shared in his latest book, <I>The Little BIG Things</I>.&nbsp; Peters talked about the idea that \"Boring is Beautiful\".&nbsp; Peters named seemingly boring companies like Jim&rsquo;s Group which honed the capability of developing support systems for thousands of franchisees in such mundane businesses like all sorts of cleaning, mowing, and pressure-cleaning.&nbsp; The key underlying success factors for that industry lie in strengths that are not easily copied such as robust systems, excellent service level and good brand building, meaning good brand equity.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we are able to lock in these know-hows and institutionalise the systems that work, we would be able to develop and instil business models of even the most mundane businesses.&nbsp; That is how companies like McDonald's, Subway and Service Masters increased their global footprint.&nbsp; We can even use these, if this sector is selected. We can even use the system to tap on and train chronically low-wage workers that Mayor Zainudin mentioned and to include the elderly and disabled workforce in this industry.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In expanding this slate of drive engines to include the somewhat boring and seemingly low-tech sector, Sir, I therefore urge Government to consider them, to beware of jumping on the same over-loaded bandwagons with other economies, and consider growing these lower-lying fruits such as building intellectual property assets in seemingly lower-tech industries.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, I thank the Minister and his team for the brilliant Budget.&nbsp; I seek his considered responses to:&nbsp; (i) my request of his assessment of the last economic downturn especially the lessons we learnt; (ii) my inputs on the gaming industry; and (iii) my concern that we are<p align=left>Column: 2956</p>on the same bandwagon as many others in our search for drive engines for sustainable economic growth.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Terry Lee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.04 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Terry Lee (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I congratulate this Government for its resolve that no one be left behind through this Budget. It was clear when the Minister delivered his speech, that this Budget reminds us to set our sights further into our future &ndash; a future where we need to place Singapore and Singaporeans on a higher ground. This is the only way forward where we can continue to enjoy a higher quality of life for generations that follow.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has just revealed in its goodies bag with something for almost everyone &ndash; from low-income to middle-squeeze and businesses. It addresses the present rising cost of living and focuses on capability building for companies and workers. So it shows we have heard the people and put their concerns at the heart of our plans. But the success for this Budget is its implementation. What must we do?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cornerstone for Singapore&rsquo;s success is our strong tripartite relations. Unless we are able to harness the collective effort of the Government, employers and unions, we cannot hope to maximise the Budget. So, strengthening the very core and fragile tripartite relations from national level to individual companies becomes key in reaching our goals. There must be concerted and deliberate actions to do so. It will not happen by chance.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example in the area of Productivity and CET, how do we encourage companies to put the Budget to good use?&nbsp; We need to measure how companies can<p align=left>Column:2957</p>further improve their&nbsp;competitiveness and the quality of their workforce.&nbsp; Because if you cannot measure, you also cannot manage. <p class=\"MsoBodyText\" align=\"left\"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we need to execute it well, and measure its implementation process, making quick changes where necessary.&nbsp; But most of all, we need everyone on board.&nbsp; Singaporeans need to be inclusively involved, helping each other to reach higher ground. Unlike the past, people had a common problem&nbsp;&ndash; poverty. Today, Singapore is a more diverse society with widening income gap.&nbsp; Some are richer while others are poorer.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how do we encourage a truly inclusive Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I trust that these considerations do not come as a surprise. While I rise in support for what I call the most Singaporean-centric Budget, I urge that we consider how it will be used and what real impact can be created on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoBodyText\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To have no one left behind, it will take more than this Government and this Budget.&nbsp; It requires everyone&rsquo;s collective effort.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.08 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will speak in Malay please.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2011/20110228/20110228VS_164221.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*</I>.] Mr Deputy Speaker, the community generally welcomes this year's Budget.&nbsp; I am pleased that this Budget, which provides a lot of benefits for the middle and lower income, will help many Singaporeans including Malay families.&nbsp; They will be able to enjoy the Grow and Share package that was unveiled.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the challenges faced by many people presently is the impact of the rise in cost of living.&nbsp; We understand the<p align=left>Column:2958</p>grievances about increasing food prices as well as other costs like the electricity bills and so on.&nbsp; It is not easy to support a family and raise children in this present situation.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore this Budget presented some timely \"solutions\" to reduce the impact of rising living costs.&nbsp; On average, a family will receive around $3,000 from this Budget through goodies and tax benefits.&nbsp; The low-income group will also receive more.&nbsp; Overall, if compared to the impact of inflation that is estimated to be around 5% to 6%, these two groups will receive more.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the long term, the various incentives offered which include childcare subsidies, further education for adults and skills upgrading will surely help many citizens.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other incentives available will make it easier for parents to focus on investing in their children's education like the Child Development Credit.&nbsp; The Malay community should seize the incentive opportunity and education subsidy offered, among others, like getting a diploma or degree.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few moments ago, Mr Low Thia Khiang, head of the Opposition, of the Workers' Party, had given his view that this Budget is not enough to fulfill the needs of Singaporeans.&nbsp; I feel that he was only giving criticism on the Budget but did not give any explanations.&nbsp; Maybe he thought that the elections has begun.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, through policies implemented by the Government like GST and the policy of using foreign workers, we have seen good economic development with low unemployment and we have enjoyed a growth that can be shared by all Singaporeans, even though our economy is also generated by foreign workers.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column:2959</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, like other communities, the Malay/Muslim community is also trying to improve their lives.&nbsp; They are aware of the swift changes and growth in our economy.&nbsp; They also have the same aspirations and desires, and also face similar concerns like the problem of cost of living.&nbsp; However, in their journey towards progress and prosperity, the Malay/Muslim community can be proud of their many achievements.&nbsp; No matter what the perceptions or grievances are, the fact is that, in reality, the community's success, be it in material or spiritual terms, cannot be denied.&nbsp; It is something that should be hailed because their success is a part of Singapore's success.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like the other communities, for the Malay/Muslim community, retaining one's identity of language, culture and religion is important.&nbsp; In fact, Islam is part of life for the Malay/Muslim community.&nbsp; However, the Malay/Muslim community also realise that they live in a multi-racial society that accepts one another, leads a tolerant life and learn from each other.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diversity has strengthened a multi-racial country like Singapore.&nbsp; Surely, challenges are present within that diversity, but it is something that we always managed to overcome.&nbsp; We can give and take, and live harmoniously&nbsp;&ndash; something that Singapore can be proud of.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom line is even though differences exist, we are all committed to ensure the nation's harmony and progress.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other areas, we cannot also deny that there are a lot of achievements among Malay students who receive <I>Madrasah</I> education, for example.&nbsp; We must be proud of these success stories and many of these <I>Madrasah</I> students <p align=left>Column:2960</p>complete their University education with good results.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just look at MUIS.&nbsp; Its officers comprise qualified <I>asatizahs</I> who have received the best education in the secular and religious fields, with some of them even have also received prestigious overseas scholarships.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will surely portray a positive image for our community.&nbsp; From among those who are well versed in religion&nbsp;&ndash; they can help and lead the community to balance the needs and implications of life in a modern and secular society, with the obligations and interests in Islam.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These characteristics are also seen in our mosques that have been developed with a more open concept and including programmes and activities that can attract all generations.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the progress and improvement in the lives of the Malay/Muslim community for all these years are not only in the secular field but also in the religious field.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I welcome what was said by the Prime Minister when he acknowledged that the Malay/Muslim community has made a special effort to foster closer relations with other communities.&nbsp; I am always confident that the Malay/Muslim community can be proud because they are able to have a partnership with the Government and this good relationship is not easily rattled.&nbsp; There are more benefits that can be gained as long as the Government and community work together to cope with any challenge, be it economic, religious or social.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, I am confident that this Budget will continue to benefit the Malay/Muslim community and this Budget will continue to share the nation's wealth and promises policies that can help increase income for the long term.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column:2961</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also shows that the programmes being implemented continuously are based on meritocracy regardless of race or religion.&nbsp; With that, they can reassure the community that their progress, whether in secular or religious areas, will continue in line with the Government's plans and we will continue to have a partnership in order to succeed together.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I feel that there is one area that should be given more attention by the Government. This is to increase engagement efforts to help the Malay-Muslim community to be more ready, and know how to make use of national resources as well as the various schemes that can enable them to improve their standard of living.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also produce more programmes to engage the community so that they can make use of opportunities in education, employment and businesses, just as what the Budget aims to encourage. I can see a new window of opportunity that will bring the community to prosper to the next level. With that, we can enjoy prosperity and forge a stronger partnership with the Government.<br></p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3025-3030.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I> ): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in my five years sitting here through the Budget debates, we have gone&nbsp;from uptrend, to downtrend and uptrend again.&nbsp; The cycle is certainly getting shorter but we have to thank the many Government policies&nbsp;put in place to&nbsp;bring us to where we are today.&nbsp; I think that the Budget is certainly one that is welcomed by many Singaporeans I&nbsp;spoke to, especially the Growth and Share package. It is the right thing to do, to share the fruits of our growth with Singaporeans.&nbsp; When&nbsp;you think about it, Singaporeans&nbsp;get the lion's share of any surpluses of the economy even though we are also helped by foreign manpower and foreign companies&nbsp;&ndash; something the Member Mr Low Thia Khiang and the Workers' Party should<p align=left>Column: 2962</p>think about before criticising the foreign manpower policy.&nbsp; We have a diversified globalised economy where benefits and surpluses of the economy are given out.&nbsp; Singaporeans get them.&nbsp; So, economically global but local at heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent Middle-East crisis in Egypt and now Libya and others, reminds us of the importance of a responsible and fair Government to ensure that the country&rsquo;s wealth is fairly re-distributed back its people.&nbsp; Not just surplus sharing&nbsp;but ensuring that the Budget is well-distributed, for the various Ministries to deliver the right services and do the right things for the people&nbsp;&ndash; education, healthcare, employment, security, and so forth.&nbsp; In this light, it was also prudent that the Government returned the $4 billion in reserves to emphasise the importance of a country&rsquo;s savings.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that this sets the tone on the future use of our reserves in the national interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, I think that the whole Budget is well-balanced to address the needs of the day, for example,&nbsp;rising costs of inflation, as well as for the long-term interests of our county, for example,&nbsp;the need for our economy to&nbsp;become more competitive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with the ESC recommendations, I commend the Minister for continuing the&nbsp;commitment towards realising 30% real income growth for Singaporeans over a decade and driving productivity in the economy through various Government programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see a number of challenges, such as our dependency on imports, for example, fuel and goods, land scarcity which means higher property prices and rentals in the long term and, increasingly, a competitive Asian region.&nbsp; These factors have a significant impact on business costs and can erode productivity for businesses and continue to constrain wages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2963</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This commitment by the Government is certainly well-meaning but given the constraints, I think it is quite difficult to execute.&nbsp; So, I am keen to find out, if the Minister can enlighten, what are the factors the Ministry is confident of influencing to achieve the real income growth targets that it has set for itself?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the long-term view, how does the Minister plan to contain the land costs and rental?&nbsp; Given our small land mass, there is a limit to how much we can play with land banking and release of property supply.&nbsp; Property and rental tend to be among the largest costs in doing business in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The continued push for productivity is certainly commendable, especially how the Budget balances productivity incentives, corporate income tax rebates and increases in foreign worker levy.&nbsp; The issue that many are concerned about is whether the broad-based foreign worker levy increases may translate into higher prices to end-consumers and businesses as companies battle the profitability pressure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are sectors that are naturally labour-intensive and where Singaporeans are not keen on performing these jobs.&nbsp; Companies here may be hit hard&nbsp;such as those in the cleaning services, nursing homes, elderly care, even construction fields.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans who are better qualified today do not wish to take up these jobs,&nbsp;so there is no strategic pressure to significantly reduce foreign worker dependency in these areas for the long term.&nbsp; The impact is that consumers who need such services may see daycare health services or conservancy charges increase as a result.&nbsp; There is a limit to how much manpower can be cut back through automation to keep our estates clean or to care for our sick, disabled and elderly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2964</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, the Government should consider tiering the levies. Maintain the levy increases for jobs where the supply of local manpower can meet the manpower requirements.&nbsp; But we should moderate the levy increases for the lower-tier jobs where few locals are able to provide the required manpower even if we increased their salaries by 10% to 20% or to the point where it is no longer economically viable.&nbsp; Perhaps, we should&nbsp;then consider even looking at changing the foreign worker ratios at this level.&nbsp; For example, the Town Councils are already finding it difficult to fill up&nbsp;the Singaporean worker ratios,&nbsp;not just because of salaries, but the reality is that as&nbsp;Asians, many&nbsp;find it difficult to accept because of face value.&nbsp; There is little point to constrain the use of foreign workers at times because it is not realistic to force Singaporeans to undertake certain jobs, not for economic reasons, but for certain cultural reasons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I hope is for us to level the playing field at the skilled-tiers, so that better qualified locals and especially the senior workers above 40, who have been displaced, all&nbsp;have a better chance of competing.&nbsp; I am not advocating affirmative action but let the market compete for talent based on employee value, drive and experience and not cheaper salaries at the expense of the qualified tiers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, this will help us ensure fair increases in wages in tandem with productivity so that qualified manpower and those with relevant experience will not find their wages constrained through cheaper and unproductive alternatives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, given the vibrant economy, I am surprised that we also have not gone further to give greater emphasis to address a number of our nation&rsquo;s long-term challenges&nbsp;such as our fertility rate, the impact of healthcare costs on our ageing population and<p align=left>Column: 2965</p>keeping employment inclusive for increasingly ageing, yet better-qualified manpower.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, our birth and fertility rate. I am aware that Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng has already indicated that plans will only be released later, but this is something of&nbsp;national interest and I hope that more can be done to create an environment where Singapore can become a conducive, easy-going and affordable environment to raise children with more support for young families.&nbsp; It is a known fact that couples here tend to marry late nowadays and there are also certainly more singles, as mentioned by Nominated Member Paulin Straughan.&nbsp; Thus, it is more important to make it conducive and affordable to bear children,&nbsp;not just one child but in multiples and review&nbsp;our policies in entirety, and not just a few incentives such as paid maternity or paternity leave. Let us look at it holistically.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need a whole-of-Government approach.&nbsp; Because of our high-performing economy, there may need to be a balance of hard incentives as well as a cultural change in the way employers view parents, and how successful we are in helping parents cope with their children&rsquo;s education, such as&nbsp;better managing the enrichment class and tuition \"arms-race\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should even review flat sizes to determine if size and a sense of larger space will encourage couples to have more children and if this enables better family support through inter-generational living, that is, encouraging even grandparents to live with young couples.&nbsp; I have raised a Budget cut&nbsp;under the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and will elaborate further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, perhaps we should also look at the long-term impact of&nbsp;our healthcare system.&nbsp; The 3Ms&nbsp;&ndash; Medisave, MediShield<p align=left>Column: 2966</p>and Medifund can still be daunting, especially when one in the family gets seriously ill&nbsp;and for a substantial period.&nbsp; As we move into an ageing population, many have provided feedback that once a loved one is admitted to hospital for serious illness several times, the cumulative costs can run into several hundreds or&nbsp;thousands of dollars. And before Medifund can be activated, one almost needs to deplete the Medisave and MediShield options&nbsp;even from other family members at times.&nbsp; Think of the apprehension of others, once their own Medisave is depleted for their loved ones and then they will look at themselves and say, \"I have got nothing left\".&nbsp; There is a need for us to,&nbsp;perhaps, look at the long term, on how to keep medical costs affordable&nbsp;despite all the good efforts that we are doing to streamline healthcare costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, during the last downturn, we saw many above 50 years old finding it difficult to find employment once they are retrenched or are forced to retire.&nbsp; We need to create an environment where there is sufficient employment opportunities and an environment that is more accepting of older workers.&nbsp; The Government has made the right move to provide the Special Employment Credit over the next three years to encourage the employment of older workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will need more than hard benefits to change the culture. I think the Government needs to do more to signal a change in mindset among employers.&nbsp; Many tend to consider the alternatives that are available due to easy access to cheaper, younger foreign workforce.&nbsp; Though most cases I encounter currently are from the blue-collared workforce, I see more and more Professional, Managerial, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) affected and this trend, I expect,&nbsp;will&nbsp;continue in the next downturn and subsequent ones.&nbsp; In the near future, the PMET segment&nbsp;&ndash; better paid, better qualified&nbsp;&ndash; will face greater challenges<p align=left>Column: 2967</p>when they reach this stage of their careers.&nbsp; They will need more time to find a job when displaced, given their higher wage expectations and they face the challenge of being over-qualified.&nbsp; We need to look at the challenges of the middle-class who may find themselves sandwiched in this situation and perhaps, gear up job matchings and skills-upgrade measures for this group of workers.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most are beginning to adapt to the shorter economic cycles and facing up to the reality that the churning of jobs are part and parcel of a restructured economy.&nbsp; This makes it even more important for the Government to help them generate more wealth and savings, by increasing their real incomes over the next decade.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I started my speech&nbsp;about&nbsp;the situation in Egypt&nbsp;and will end with it.&nbsp; I read a recent <I>Asian Intelligence Report</I> published by the Political&nbsp;and Risk Consultancy Ltd based in Hong Kong, entitled \"Internet and Social Networking as Forces for Change\".&nbsp; I quote: \"The major question (one that we cannot really answer even after observing Singapore for decades now) is whether or not there is something in the <I>status quo</I> that is so sustainable that there is no fertile ground for anti-government political activists to use the Internet to take root and grow their base of support.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet and new media can incite, as shown by the Middle-East situation presently.&nbsp; But used correctly, the Internet and new media can be an&nbsp;effective outreach for the Government to engage with the new generation and in their own language and not with our long speeches in Budgets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, while the going is good and the risk of destabilisation is not high, we cannot be complacent.&nbsp; Good governments<p align=left>Column: 2968</p>with good policies still need&nbsp;the buy-in from the people to complete the partnership to success.&nbsp; The Government should continue to put more people and resources in place to engage in the social media space to complete the spectrum of citizen communications.&nbsp; For all the hard work and debates over our policies, it would be sad if so few understand and do not have sufficient insights to buy in and be part of policy formulation and governance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is important&nbsp;that the Government remains prudent and fair in how we use taxpayer dollars&nbsp;&ndash; that is be able to account for the taxpayer dollars that we collect, and generate sufficient returns&nbsp;&ndash; in kinds and social benefits&nbsp;&ndash; to deliver our social compact with citizens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;think the Budget is reflective of what the people need at this point.&nbsp; It shows a good understanding of the ground and being useful in the time of need.&nbsp; Like a good cook, the Government &ndash; and credit to the Ministry of Finance&nbsp;&ndash; has included the sauces and ingredients that keep the flavour just right, balancing the sweet,&nbsp;sour and the bitter and to keep the dish flavourful.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Budget and look forward to the fine cuisine of success to come.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The second major thrust of this year&rsquo;s Budget resonated strongly with my sentiments and that is about \"strengthening our society\".&nbsp; I am encouraged by his Statement that \"we will take further measures to ensure an inclusive society\".&nbsp; I would like to applaud the Minister for Finance on his approach<p align=left>Column: 2969</p>on&nbsp;focusing to&nbsp;help the low-income group through education, employment and home ownership.<br> &nbsp; <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me relate to you this true story.&nbsp; One new resident has just moved into the HDB interim housing in my constituency. She is in her 40s and has re-married&nbsp;recently.&nbsp; She has five children aged nine to 20 plus years old, and one three-year-old grandson, all from her previous marriage.&nbsp; Her present husband is unemployed and the whole family is living off the $650 per month earnings of the 20-year-old son.&nbsp; All her three older children had dropped out of school at the end of Primary 6; the reasons given were financial difficulties and family violence in her previous marriage.&nbsp; Her two daughters, aged nine and 12, are receiving some educational support but their grades in school are not encouraging. Sir, this resident is struggling to make ends meet and that is the reason why I have become so well-acquainted with her at my Meet-the-People sessions.&nbsp; This family will benefit from measures announced in this Budget to assist them, especially their children.<br></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The crux of the matter is, how do we ensure that such families are the recipients of&nbsp;the various schemes intended for them? The Minister for Finance said that social mobility will become more challenging as our society matures.&nbsp; Therefore, while we have the resources, we have to ensure that those most in need do not miss the chance of uplifting themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these years, our Government has invested heavily to provide very affordable education for all our students. Whilst this did enable social mobility in the past, the hope for this happening now seems to be thinning with the increasing widening of the income gap. The struggling households are hard-pressed nurturing their children, let alone providing the human resource we need. According to <p align=left>Column: 2970</p>most economists, it is difficult for the children from a family of four, earning below the subsistence level of $1,700, to have any fighting chance moving up the social ladder in life.&nbsp; How then are we to ensure an inclusive society?&nbsp; Our pledge to have an equal and just society based on meritocracy must be upheld.&nbsp; I am happy that the Finance Minister is going to provide more in child development credits, enhancements to KiFAS and CFAC, support for school and tertiary students.&nbsp; But, more importantly, we have to make sure that disadvantaged children are sent to kindergarten,&nbsp;not dropping out of schools and&nbsp;having a chance to be tertiary students in&nbsp;order to benefit&nbsp;from the assistance laid out for them in&nbsp;education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with the Minister for Finance when he concluded in his Budget Statement that we will find every effective way to help those who start off lower down to discover&nbsp;their aspirations.&nbsp; Prime Minister&nbsp;Lee said in December last year that Singapore's social safety net is working well and the Government will keep finding ways to improve it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The point that I am trying to make is that&nbsp;there is a need to improve the&nbsp;lot of the people at the bottom&nbsp;with a pragmatic approach. The various safety nets, such as the 3M schemes, PA, ComCare, Workfare, housing and educational schemes, had mitigated the impact thus far. But globalisation will continue to dampen the wages of the low-income families.&nbsp; Sir, I am suggesting that there is a need for another safety net, one that can help the bottom 5% of children in the lowest income group. The pre-emptive move to intervene and assist these children from an early stage would be wise. The expenditure targeted at this group of children will not have the effect of creating a handout mentality or&nbsp;taxing the population, but will have the opposite effect of nurturing a future generation that will not cause&nbsp;social instability and will&nbsp;contribute&nbsp;to society.&nbsp; If we take 5% <p align=left>Column: 2971</p>of 40,000 per year, it is about&nbsp;2,000 children per year, and&nbsp;over 20 years, it would be 40,000 adults contributing to the future.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We typically think of social welfare programmes as a trade-off against productivity.&nbsp; But I would argue that focusing on children from the lowest income families is not a trade-off but perpetually an additive to social efficiency.&nbsp; First, we are targeting educational goals to level up the productivity of every member of society.&nbsp; Paying attention to the education of these children can be seen as a way of addressing the question of how we can further improve our primary and secondary school pass rates.&nbsp; Second, we will also be fostering inter-generational mobility&nbsp;&ndash; that is, the opportunity for children to rise above the income group of their parents&nbsp;&ndash; and we should consider the positive incentive effects of this enhancement to social mobility.&nbsp; The importance of the idea of social mobility is highlighted by the dynamism that drives the United States'&nbsp;economy, which can be partly attributed to the idea of the \"American dream\", that people are empowered to build a better future for themselves.&nbsp; On the contrary, I have heard that the income divide in Hong Kong had grown so stark that&nbsp; people are beginning to be discouraged and to lose hope in the strive for possible social mobility.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prime Minister&nbsp;Lee had said that society is feeling the strain of globalisation, ageing population and troubled families but deciding how best to help the poor is a complex issue.&nbsp; I agree with him and, in this context, it is apt to apply the same concept as in medicine&nbsp;&ndash; prevention is better than cure&nbsp;&ndash; before more dysfunctional families are entrenched and become a future source of problems for society.&nbsp; Children at-risk must be&nbsp;identified early.&nbsp; We can get information about <p align=left>Column: 2972</p>families at-risk, for example, at&nbsp;registration at birth.&nbsp; They are assisted and monitored till at least secondary schools by hands-on approach through assigned&nbsp;social workers for eligible families under this safety net.&nbsp; The main aim is to ensure that these children get the assisted guidance and care which is otherwise unattainable if left on their own.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hands-on approach catered to each individual family in a holistic way is the best approach to assist these families.&nbsp; Many of them are not knowledgeable enough to tap on the available assistance schemes in place.&nbsp; The social worker can recommend presently available KiFAS and CFAS under ComCare Grow for their children.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;two pilot schemes for intensive care management that cater to only 150 cases for&nbsp;two years. There is another pilot scheme by MCYS to identify at-risk children at&nbsp;three primary schools and&nbsp;three Family Service Centres (FSCs). What we need now is to have more permanent constructive programmes and resources and the right policy to implement to help this lowest 5% of children.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two main suggestions for what we can do.&nbsp; First, we need a more deliberate and systemic programme for providing assistance to children from low-income families at primary and secondary schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;At an earlier stage, these children may need nutrition and healthcare; then later at schooling stage, more assistance on&nbsp;educational and social help are required to assist these children.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important to address their psychological needs. Children from low-income families can feel outcast and thus&nbsp;get turned off school due to a surprisingly acute awareness of their income gulf with schoolmates. We can help to&nbsp;bridge the gap in appearances, whether if it is by providing extra sets of clean uniforms or assessment books and stationery.&nbsp; But we may also need to make a special effort to make them feel welcome in school,<p align=left>Column: 2973</p>perhaps by devoting extra school counsellor or teacher attention to them. Whether providing for physical or psychological needs, may I suggest that we need a structured programme that can be implemented across all schools, to look into making children from low-income families feel at home in the school environment.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second suggestion is to focus more efforts on helping to promote a&nbsp;stable family environment that gives these children&nbsp;an opportunity to concentrate on their studies.&nbsp; It may be necessary to help the parents in order to provide a more conducive environment for the upbringing of children.&nbsp; Many of them may&nbsp;be dysfunctional families as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such families&nbsp;may need help in many areas to ensure stable homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are existing schemes that the social workers may recommend to them,&nbsp;for example, to take advantage of the HOPE monetary assistance for those with just&nbsp;two children. Some parents of these families may even need medical care or psychiatric/psychological help. Others may need upgrading of jobs or job placement. The aim is to prevent dysfunctional homes from getting worse, to ensure a conducive environment for the upbringing of their children.&nbsp; It would be good, while improving on these children's&nbsp;opportunities,&nbsp;the by-product is getting their parents out of their poverty traps and future prevention of dysfunctional families.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting handouts to them, but these families are assisted to improve their situations.&nbsp; Therefore, through hands-on guidance by designated social workers to tailor to each family's needs, they can better take advantage of specific schemes suitable for them to improve their family income.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister Mentor&nbsp;Lee recently made the point that we need to encourage parents who may not have attained high education standards to inculcate a spirit of learning in their children.&nbsp; This point <p align=left>Column: 2974</p>resonates with me because with regard to addressing a widening income gap, I think the idea of focusing on helping children to have the best opportunity to do well, to rise above the income level they were born into, is particularly attractive.&nbsp; Our declining fertility rate means that every child counts towards securing Singapore's future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empowering children from the lower income families is a social welfare programme that may not detract but, in fact, add to our country's economic prospects.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.41 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan):</B> Sir,&nbsp;I would like to comment on Budget 2011 under five headings.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the&nbsp;abiding principles.&nbsp; The Budget serves as an annual reminder of the two enduring principles of prudence and planning for the long haul that the Government has consistently followed in its financial management.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first principle of prudence has been remarkably demonstrated once again in the Government's decision to refund $4 billion to past reserves even though there is no legal or constitutional obligation&nbsp;to do so.&nbsp; It would have been easy to distribute this largesse as \"election\" goodies, but that would not be the wise thing to do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For resource-scarce Singapore, our reserves are our only buffer against future financial storms and global recessions,&nbsp;which are uncertain&nbsp;only in timing and severity.&nbsp; The reserves must be maintained and carefully built up as a matter of priority and only dipped into when absolutely necessary.&nbsp; We must not take the easy way out and break the piggy bank at every whim and fancy, and think that there are no consequences as some would have us believe.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2975</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All over Europe, countries like the United Kingdom&nbsp;are on an austerity drive and cutting their budgets,&nbsp;including once generous welfare benefits,&nbsp;to reduce their enormous fiscal deficit.&nbsp; The United Kingdom's&nbsp;Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr George Osborne, said in his Emergency Budget 2010 speech that welfare in the United Kingdom&nbsp;costs &pound;192 billion a year, a \"staggering\" increase of 45% over a decade, and that they are wasting the talents of millions and spending billions on it.&nbsp; Further belt-tightening measures are expected in the United Kingdom for the coming Budget 2011.&nbsp; Countries like Ireland, Spain and Portugal are paying the price of profligacy.&nbsp; Their credit standing no longer makes the cut in financial markets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second principle is planning for the long haul.&nbsp; We must focus on the long term, and invest for the future, through the ups and downs of the economic cycle and the election cycle.&nbsp; The fruit of such patient, focused and long-term planning can be very gratifying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was at Marina Bay the other day, and stood marvelling at the smartly designed buildings.&nbsp; To my left was Customs House, a new office block that replaced the Overseas Union House and former Change Alley Aerial Plaza.&nbsp; Further down was Fullerton Bay Hotel, with rooms and suites that seemed to float on the waters of the Bay.&nbsp; To my right were several soaring office towers of the Marina Bay Financial Centre and Asia Square, plus a slightly older but no less impressive One Raffles Quay.&nbsp; Stretched across the other side of the Bay, far as my eyes can see, stood the majestic and monumental Marina Bay Sands with its 50 storey high Skypark and just opened Art Science Museum.&nbsp; And to think that the blueprint for the whole new downtown at Marina South was drawn up over 20 years ago!&nbsp; Only now is the exciting skyline of Singapore taking <p align=left>Column: 2976</p>shape.&nbsp; Such is and must continue to be the planning horizon of Singapore's budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is only possible when we have adequate resources and is therefore predicated on the first principle.&nbsp; These two principles of prudence and planning for the long term must continue to guide and shape all our budgetary efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the attainment of productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next 10 years, the aim is to raise incomes by 30%&nbsp;&ndash; or 2.7% &ndash;&nbsp;per annum&nbsp;so that we can attain the living standards and purchasing power now enjoyed by developed countries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of our resource limitations and size, we have no hinterland or domestic economy to grow and, hence, the only way to attain those lofty goals is to grow Singaporeans' real income through innovation and increasing productivity. In other words, we need to pursue continuous economic restructuring and purge ourselves of inefficiencies which retard our growth. The Government is therefore determined to push through its new growth strategy which focuses on making workers and companies more productive. There will be no U-turn on this growth policy.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the increase in foreign worker levy just one year after the last increase, and especially for construction and services which are notoriously dependent on foreign low skilled labour.&nbsp; Added to rising wage pressures, higher rents, utilities, etc, the&nbsp;foreign worker levy&nbsp;increase plus the 0.5% increase in employer&rsquo;s CPF could add to higher business costs, at least in the short to medium term until productivity catches up.&nbsp; This has already set off alarm bells among businesses whose growth might be constrained by such cost increases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a painful but necessary step in a combination of incentives and disincentives to nudge our enterprises away <p align=left>Column: 2977</p>from over-reliance on low-skilled foreign labour and, in the long run, raise overall wage levels.&nbsp; Hence, the Minister has already in place short-term measures, such as the corporate income tax rebate and the SME cash grant to offset these increases.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve real income growth of 30% over the next decade, the Government is significantly increasing funding to promote productivity and innovation.&nbsp; Two significant measures are the enhanced Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC)&nbsp;and an additional $1 billion top up to the National Productivity Fund.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there have been murmurings, particularly from the SMEs, over the complexity and difficulty in navigating and accessing these funds.&nbsp; This was, in fact, one of the feedback inputs which REACH received during our pre-Budget 2011 feedback exercise.&nbsp; They wanted more communication and guidance as to how firms, particularly the SMEs, can make use of the PIC.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, some tax experts feel that the PIC seems to favour high value sectors like pharmaceuticals.&nbsp; In comparison, as the enhanced PIC allows for up to 400% tax rebate for investment in innovation and R&amp;D among others, companies in the services industry, like retail, that are not usually involved in R&amp;D, may not benefit&nbsp; that much from the PIC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To resolve some of the foregoing issues, the National Productivity and Continuing Education Council could render more sector-specific help to SMEs to educate them on how they can tap on the PIC for productivity improvements&nbsp;&ndash; even sharing with them some productivity improvement exercises undertaken by similar local and/or foreign SMEs.&nbsp; The effort can mirror what MOM is doing in the labour market to re-design jobs for higher productivity.&nbsp; Otherwise, even if the <p align=left>Column: 2978</p>PIC has been enhanced significantly, some businesses may still be unable to take advantage of it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is still early days, as the new upsized PIC supersedes the old and is only applicable from&nbsp;Year of Assessment&nbsp;2011 onwards.&nbsp; Hence, statistics on the take-up rate of PIC will only be available in early 2012.&nbsp; We need to monitor this closely to ensure that more firms are caught up in the productivity bandwagon and that there are real improvements in productivity through the use of these incentives.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>Third, the avoidance of dependence.&nbsp;&nbsp; We must recognise that no one owes us a living, and while Asia is growing and is fast becoming the new centre of gravity for the global economy, competitive pressures are also piling up.&nbsp; Some Opposition Members have accused us of having a siege mentality, but as Intel founder Andy Grove reminds us in his famous dictum, \"only the paranoid survive\".&nbsp; We should take nothing for granted.&nbsp; We must preserve the work ethic and reward work so as not to breed a crutch mentality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to avoid breeding any dependency among our workers and instead encourage a spirit of self reliance.&nbsp; Hence, the most powerful rewards in Budget 2011,&nbsp;such as the Workfare Special Bonus, personal income tax rebate and the more progressive personal income tax schedule go to the employed &ndash; not the unemployed, although I must hasten to add that they do also benefit from the Budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unconditional welfare is not the answer, nor is minimum wage, as some are clamouring for.&nbsp; Instead, WIS and WTS are currently the best tools to help our low-wage workers.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;there is room&nbsp;to make them more appealing and effective.&nbsp; I, for one, believe that WIS <p align=left>Column: 2979</p>should be a regular feature of our Budget which should have a more redistributive slant henceforth because of the lingering presence of low-wage and older workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, in my view, and as many of my parliamentary colleagues have voiced in this House before me, WIS should have more cash payments and more regular payments.&nbsp; The special WIS bonus payments for&nbsp;three years starting from this fiscal year, all in cash,&nbsp;form a partial answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Minister for&nbsp;Manpower and Minister for Finance&nbsp;to review this and implement changes for the longer term and not on an <I>ad hoc</I> basis to make WIS really effective.&nbsp; WIS payouts could be increased when the economy does well, such as via special bonus payments which Budget 2011 has done.&nbsp; The qualifying income ceiling for WIS and the quantum of WIS should also be reviewed regularly to factor in inflation and to ensure that WIS does make a meaningful difference to our low-wage workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the ratio of cash to CPF in the Workfare payout is 1:2.5, which means that the worker gets only a small sum in cash payout whilst such low-income wage earners with families are usually cash strapped.&nbsp; Hence, instead of about one third being paid out in cash,&nbsp;up to 50% could be paid out in cash.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, WIS is now only paid out twice a year.&nbsp; To make a real difference for our low-wage workers, WIS should be paid out more frequently&nbsp;&ndash; if not monthly, then at least quarterly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the alleviation of social divisions.&nbsp; As we become more affluent, there is a risk towards lower social mobility, as children from more affluent families have access to more opportunities.&nbsp; They therefore enjoy more advantage over those from the lower <p align=left>Column: 2980</p>income.&nbsp; And as my parliamentary colleague, Dr Lily Neo, has quoted, Minister Mentor had observed recently that more than half of students at top schools like Raffles Institution had fathers who were university educated.&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, among the four neighbourhood schools he had obtained data on, the highest percentage was only 13.1% at Chai Chee Secondary School.&nbsp;&nbsp; Assistant Professor Ivan Ng and his co-researchers at the NUS found in one of their studies that Singapore&rsquo;s inter-generational mobility or the extent to which children&rsquo;s economic status depends on their parents&rsquo; was similar to that of the US, which is low compared with that in other developed countries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to this article, the MOE has said that studies undertaken by international experts and its own statistics indicate that students from these disadvantaged homes or lower socio-economic groups are still able to move up in Singapore.&nbsp; It further cited the recent Programme for International Student Assessment 2009 administered by OECD which reported that Singapore had one of the highest proportion of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds who did better than what their circumstances would otherwise predict.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE noted that almost half of the students who live in&nbsp;1- to 3-room HDB flats were admitted to universities and polytechnics, and this ratio has remained stable over the past decade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No doubt these statistics are commendable and do allay some of the concerns about increasing social immobility.&nbsp; Nonetheless, anecdotal evidence and statistics at the micro level, such as those observed by Minister Mentor, do indicate that we need to constantly guard against creeping social immobility, which will erode the value and relevance of meritocracy upon which Singapore heavily depends.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2981</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another sustainable way to overcome the widening income gap is to engineer future generations out of the poverty trap.&nbsp; The People&rsquo;s Association Women&rsquo;s Integration Network (WIN), of which I am an advisor, started a mentorship programme for primary school girls from disadvantaged families some&nbsp;two years ago.&nbsp; One of these girls, Zheng Yuzi,&nbsp;is the youngest in a family of&nbsp;eight children and whose mother is a divorcee and the sole breadwinner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When she was first adopted&nbsp;by the programme, she had been doing poorly in her studies.&nbsp; Last year, after two years of constant befriending, guidance and tutoring from her mentor who is a retired teacher, she performed well enough to enter the express stream at St Margaret&rsquo;s Secondary School.&nbsp; This is indeed a heart-warming story but it also shows that for children from disadvantaged families, it takes an enormous amount of time and resources to be lifted up the social ladder.&nbsp; For some without that additional leg up, they might fall by the wayside.&nbsp; These sorts of circumstances are not merely the ingredients for a weepy Mandarin TV drama, but are often borne out in real life.&nbsp; Such children are often caught in the vicious cycle of a dysfunctional family, absentee parents, poverty and negative peer influence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst the many helping hands approach is to be lauded and encouraged, the Government could put in more resources to enhance and expand the capacities of social workers, counsellors at VWOs and schools to help ensure that children from disadvantaged families have the opportunity to maximise their potential and move up the social ladder.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The example I gave earlier also serves to highlight the importance of the VWO sector.&nbsp; VWOs can operate at a more granular level, and be more attuned to local needs, or the needs of specific<p align=left>Column: 2982</p>vulnerable groups.&nbsp; That sector must be nurtured and strengthened so as to optimise the many helping hands approach the Government has espoused.&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, more holistic and comprehensive help, such as WIN Council&rsquo;s and&nbsp; my CDC&rsquo;s&nbsp; mentoring schemes&nbsp;&ndash; GRACE mentorship programme and Adopt a Family programme in partnership with grassroots and VWOs&nbsp;&ndash; and other similar programmes should be encouraged.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next,&nbsp;the allocation of funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the $47.1 billion 2011 Budget, among others, 26% is allocated for Defence, 23% for Education and 8.7% for Health.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the substantial investments in Defence and Education to ensure the continued safety and security of our country in an increasingly uncertain and fractious world and also to ensure the relevance, employability and increasing productivity of our workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the 8.7% for Health seems inadequate especially in view of our ageing population.&nbsp; By comparison, the Hong Kong government&rsquo;s budget for health for fiscal year 2011-2012 is 16.5%.&nbsp; It is reported that the Hong Kong government&rsquo;s expenditure on health care was&nbsp;previously between 13%&nbsp;and 15% of total expenditure or 3% to 4% of its GDP.&nbsp; In Singapore, our budgeted health care expenditure for fiscal year 2011 is estimated to be&nbsp;about 1.2% of GDP, although this would not have taken into account funding through the 3Ms.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst we should not be advocating a welfare based healthcare system like many&nbsp;of the OECD countries whose average spending on health care is reported to be 8.3% of GDP in 2001&nbsp;&ndash; clearly an unsustainable figure&nbsp;&ndash; there appears to be a need to expand the healthcare budget in future, especially due to an ageing population.&nbsp; Moreover, healthcare costs remain a key concern for many Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Hong Kong, we could look into enhancement of mental health <p align=left>Column: 2983</p>services, chronic disease management and public primary care services.&nbsp; More assistance could be provided to low income elderly for treatment of their chronic diseases and more infrastructures for the frail elderly like home nursing and step down care could be provided.&nbsp; Support could also be given to care givers of the elderly sick, who are themselves not well off.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, just last week, while visiting a resident&rsquo;s wake, the deceased&rsquo;s 59-year-old son who works as a coffee shop assistant shared with me that he is very satisfied with this year&rsquo;s Budget as it has given him a lot of attention and help, as a low-income worker.&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that he could not have asked for more.&nbsp; His remark brought much cheer to me. He exclaimed, \"How can you honestly not support a Government like this who has a heart for the people and for Singapore&rsquo;s long term future!\"&nbsp;&nbsp; How indeed!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prudent, pro-growth, and people centric&nbsp;&ndash; these budgetary principles and practices that will put us and future generations in good stead is the hallmark of a sensible, objective and responsible Government.&nbsp; If this is what people call an election budget, then I know that we will have an election budget every year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support Budget 2011.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And thanks to the generous support of our volunteers and kind donors, each guest received a souvenir coin with a rabbit engraved on it to mark the occasion and a $10 red packet as a gesture of our well wishes for them in the New Year.&nbsp; Most of the senior citizens were delighted and appreciative of the effort that we had put in.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there was a guest who did not enjoy the event as much as we thought he would.&nbsp; He asked me about the red packet, \"Why so little?\"&nbsp; I must admit I was quite taken aback.&nbsp; I explained to him the red packet was not meant to be a handout.&nbsp; Every resident above 60 years old was invited to lunch and hence received a red packet.&nbsp; For the&nbsp;individuals and families who are financially strapped, we have other channels to help them.&nbsp; In fact, over the Chinese New Year period, I had distributed red packets at at least six other events to needy residents of Queenstown.&nbsp;&nbsp; These were organised by various community groups such as PCF and the various religious organisations.&nbsp; And I know that many of these residents were also given red packets on other occasions too.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, the money and all the costs of the&nbsp;luncheon were raised by volunteers and supporters, and this was&nbsp;no mean feat.&nbsp; Just for the red packets alone, we are already looking at more than $30,000.&nbsp; We had held this event as an expression of our respect for and gratitude to the older generation.&nbsp; So I told this resident, \"Many people had to work pretty hard to put all these together, so I really hope you <p align=left>Column: 2985</p>do appreciate it.\"&nbsp; Likewise, I hope fellow Singaporeans can appreciate this Budget and its hamper of goodies.&nbsp; Very few countries in the world can do this, and&nbsp;we should appreciate what we have.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This all-inclusive Budget offers something for everyone, with more help allocated to the middle and lower income groups and&nbsp;this&nbsp;is an approach which has the support of&nbsp;all Singaporeans.&nbsp;This is one of the ways we use to narrow our income inequality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As our economy develops, we have to move into niche areas and higher value-added sectors to survive and stay competitive.&nbsp; What happens after that?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the article, \"The Inequality Wild Card\" by Kenneth Rogoff for the Project Syndicate reproduced in the <I>Straits Times</I> on 17th February 2011, the writer observed that&nbsp; \"we live in an era in which globalisation expands the market for ultra-talented individuals but competes away the income of ordinary employees.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;We see this happening around us&nbsp;&ndash;

There are many such families before, and examples are all around us. In the previous two generations, we see many parents like my grandparents. Their children, who are our parents' generation, went to university; and their children, who are our generation, went to top schools and got scholarships. They came from ordinary background families. There are fewer such cases nowadays. \"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, Singaporeans who came from the previous two generations shared an almost similar social background. The majority came from the low and middle income families and they shared the same challenges in life. Those who were capable, diligent and were able to maximise their opportunities, improved the lives of their families and themselves, especially that of the next generation. This created a&nbsp;virtuous cycle, where each generation&nbsp;was better than the last.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, we see some families stuck in a vicious cycle. During my MPS, many of the residents who came to seek help have shattered<p align=left>Column: 2987</p>marriages; they have low income or no income; their children suffer from poor grades or do not finish their studies; they are unwed or single mothers; they are drug addicts or have been jailed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not that they do not want to improve themselves; they just do not know where to start. They cannot lift themselves out of the cycle. As such, their children grow up,&nbsp;imitate the mistakes and fall back into the trap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are complex cases; it is not enough to let grassroots organisations or voluntary and welfare groups handle them. I hope that the Government can provide the resources to enable full-time professionals to take up these cases. This will help lift many out of the vicious cycles, especially their next generation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will&nbsp;now continue in English.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3031-3032.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<I>In English</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that we should not let children be punished for the mistakes of their parents.&nbsp; Are children the primary responsibility of their parents? Yes, absolutely.&nbsp; However, what happens when parents do not or are not able to do what they are supposed to, ie, to take care of them, feed them, keep them in school and out of trouble?&nbsp; On a case-by-case basis, the Government has to take the lead and step in.&nbsp; Without doing this, the vicious cycle of low academic achievement, poor work performance and poverty will perpetuate itself.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, we have a \"Many Helping Hands\" approach to help the needy in our community, including children from broken or dysfunctional families.&nbsp; While we should welcome more groups and people to join the movement, it is much better, in my opinion, to also have Government-appointed full-time professionally-trained case managers to take the lead and<p align=left>Column: 2988</p>manage the cases of these children and their families.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These families need more than financial assistance.&nbsp; They need financial counsellors.&nbsp; They need professional advice on which Government agency or private charity to approach to apply to for various assistance schemes.&nbsp; They need to know what papers to submit and how to do this efficiently.&nbsp; They need to know which aspects of their family culture and behaviour they have to change to bring about improvement in their lives.&nbsp; They need someone who understands their particular difficulties and strengths so that the help they receive will be holistic.&nbsp; We are dealing with rental flats, CDC, school, childcare, after-school care, medical assistance, upgrading and job applications.&nbsp; When a family has problems, all these can be very overwhelming.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a typical divorce case&nbsp;&ndash; a woman has to deal with the heartbreak, sell the flat, look for alternative accommodation, move out and transfer the kids to other&nbsp;schools, chase maintenance, try to get money for school fees, meals, bus fare, utilities, medical bills, and so on, all on top of facing the social pressure of a broken marriage and single parenthood.&nbsp; So you can imagine how helpful and reassuring having a dedicated case manager can be.&nbsp; This person can be someone from MCYS, a Family Service Centre or a different set-up, but we need to recognise the importance of having this resource and investing in professionals who can help these families.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like now to use an analogy to illustrate this.&nbsp; A few times when I visit my residents in Mei Ling Street, some residents will complain about blocked drains.&nbsp; Naturally, I will turn to the Town Council.&nbsp; If Members could now refer to the map that&nbsp;they have in their hands now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told by my Town Council that these drains in question,&nbsp;marked in red on the map, are maintained by the NEA.&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2989</p>Members can see here [<I>indicating</I> ], the parts marked in red&nbsp;are maintained by NEA while the rest are&nbsp;maintained&nbsp;by the Town Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;To my layman eye, I cannot see any difference between those in red and those managed by the Town Council.&nbsp; I am sure there is a rationale to make&nbsp;sure that one particular agency is held accountable,&nbsp;otherwise why is it that along a particular stretch of road, one section&nbsp;comes under the care of an agency while the other&nbsp;comes under&nbsp;another agency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this appears&nbsp;to create a problem on the ground.&nbsp; Apparently, the different agencies give the maintenance contracts to different companies whose workers do the cleaning job at different frequencies or different times of the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;What it means is that when the drain may be cleaned in the upstream, the downstream may be choked and the water will not flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The waterway network is all linked and forms part of our natural catchment for water.&nbsp; Hence, it has to be seamless.&nbsp; One suggestion is that within a single estate, while different agencies may hold separate budgets to maintain respective drains or parts of&nbsp;drains, perhaps they can employ the same one contractor to provide an end-to-end solution and ensure a smooth flow of water.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the drains, most of the problems faced by these dysfunctional families are all interlinked.&nbsp; Various agencies can specialise to help them in different ways but, in many cases, these families themselves cannot be the integrator.&nbsp; They either do not have the ability or they are just overwhelmed by their circumstances.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we help families like these tide over the critical, traumatic periods, stay with them as we monitor and work out the different aspects of their new lives, we will minimise the disruption and damage to the lives of their children.&nbsp; Then, just ensuring that the kids have a decent place  <p align=left>Column: 2990</p> to study will lead to improved results.&nbsp;&nbsp;The kids will&nbsp;enjoy better esteem.&nbsp; They will have a fighting chance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Queenstown, we give out annual bursaries to students from low-income families.&nbsp; We notice that about one-tenth of the primary school applicants managed to achieve only 10%-20% improvement&nbsp;in their school grades.&nbsp; While academic excellence is not required for bursaries, I felt that giving them just money will not help them much if they continue to do so&nbsp;miserably in their studies.&nbsp; So I invited the parents for a dialogue and discovered that most of their children already attend free or heavily subsidised tuition in the school, community or with the self-help groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at their family profile, which is mostly large family size squeezing in a small rental flat, I realised that the root of the problem could be that they lack a conducive environment at home to study, prepare for examinations or even do their homework.&nbsp; At the same time, their parents are likely to be busy at work and are not able to supervise them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, last year, we started a programme, Project STOMP (Student-Tutor Open Mentoring Programme), that involves youth volunteers to help these children in their studies. The volunteers do not play the part of a tutor but just as an elder brother or sister who will encourage and motivate them.&nbsp; Held twice weekly at Queenstown Community Centre, it usually starts with the students doing their&nbsp;homework or assessments. After that, the volunteers will organise some classroom games like hangman or play board games.&nbsp;During the school holidays, activities or outings are usually planned for the children.&nbsp;Besides getting better grades, we observed that the children have now become more outgoing. The quieter ones now dare to ask questions and join in the games and activities with the other children.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the students who have graduated from the programme has now even&nbsp;come back to help as a mentor.<p align=left>Column: 2991</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;While programmes like these can still be run by volunteers, and we should encourage more of them, there is a limit to how much or how much more they can do.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to call for more resources to give our children from disadvantaged families a leg up.&nbsp; I accept that even with the most aggressive measures, not all cases will succeed, for you can bring the horse to the river, but you cannot&nbsp;force it to drink.&nbsp; Nonetheless,&nbsp;I have no doubt we can be hearing&nbsp;&ndash; and I hope we&nbsp;will be hearing&nbsp;&ndash; lots of interesting, inspiring stories of men and women who emerge successful from&nbsp;rental&nbsp;flats and low-income families.&nbsp; We need not aim for the lowest score for our Gini coefficient but we should aim for the best score in social mobility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Budget.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE--><p align=left>Column: 2991<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE:::2992--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As a national basket, it includes spending by citizens, foreigners and medical tourists.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As 3Ms (Medisave, MediShield and Medifund) are intended primarily to help Singapore residents with their inpatient care (and to a lesser extent, some outpatient and long term care), looking at the proportion of NHE financed by 3Ms would not be meaningful.&nbsp;
