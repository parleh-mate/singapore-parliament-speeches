F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the\r\n\r\nMinister for his Budget statement. It was short; I\r\n\r\ndare  not  say it was short and sweet.  It  was  a\r\n\r\nbrief,    businesslike   presentation,   reviewing\r\n\r\neconomic  policy  against  the  scenario  of   the\r\n\r\neconomic   survey  of  Singapore  1974   and   the\r\n\r\nMemorandum  on the Main and Development Estimates,\r\n\r\nas  well as the detailed estimates themselves. Not\r\n\r\nlong  before the Budget statement, of course,  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Speech at the opening  of  Parliament\r\n\r\noutlined the general policy of the Government. All\r\n\r\nthese  should  make up the total backdrop  to  the\r\n\r\npresentation of Members' views today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has, of course, to be praised for\r\n\r\nhaving guided us through 1974 adroitly, managing a\r\n\r\nrelatively   good  growth  rate,  encouraging   or\r\n\r\ncontriving  diversification in  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector  in terms of manufacturing activities,  and\r\n\r\nin  the  trade  sector, in terms  of  markets.  In\r\n\r\nrespect of trade, while vigorous marketing  is  of\r\n\r\ncourse important, emphasis must be laid on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  quality of goods supplied, but very important\r\n\r\nalso, on the integrity of our traders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there is no doubt that the great majority\r\n\r\nof  our traders are reliable, there have been  one\r\n\r\nor  two  black  sheep. For instance,  a  very  bad\r\n\r\nexample  has  been set by one or two exporters  of\r\n\r\nsawn timber who have indulged in such malpractices\r\n\r\nas  to bring upon themselves, and unfortunately on\r\n\r\nothers  too,  the  distrust  of  buyers.   It   is\r\n\r\nsignificant also that ungraded timber  is  shipped\r\n\r\nmostly  to  west  Asian  countries  and  this   is\r\n\r\nparticularly  one area in which,  as  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's Budget statement states, we are seeking\r\n\r\nnew  markets.  Our merchants know  that  the  best\r\n\r\nadvertisement  is the quality of their  goods  and\r\n\r\nservice. We should make it very clear that we will\r\n\r\nnot  allow  a  few to spoil the good name  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite early in his Budget speech, the Minister\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  importance of  tourism  in  the\r\n\r\nservices  sector  of  our economy.  Even  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, in those days, when as a Backbencher  you\r\n\r\ncould  speak,  you did touch on the importance  of\r\n\r\nprotecting our tourists from dishonest dealing.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this matter has been taken care of, and  is\r\n\r\ncontinually being looked after. But more  recently\r\n\r\non  another  aspect the Finance Minister  remarked\r\n\r\npublicly  that there is no reason why the  tourist\r\n\r\nindustry   should   help  to   import   the   more\r\n\r\nundesirable manifestations of Western life-styles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also every reason indeed, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nwhy  the  tourist  industry  should  help  in  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of  our  cultural  development  through\r\n\r\ngreater encouragement of the arts, and propagation\r\n\r\nof life-styles that will result in tourists having\r\n\r\na  good  opinion of us not only for  our  material\r\n\r\nachievements,  but  also  for  our  pleasing   and\r\n\r\nrespectable cultural attainments. I think this  is\r\n\r\na more correct picture for them to take away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to expansion of tourism, I myself do\r\n\r\nnot have it very clear in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy  mind  as to whether it is owing to the efforts\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board that  we\r\n\r\nare getting more tourists, or whether people would\r\n\r\ncome in any case on the basis of promotion by  our\r\n\r\nnational airlines, our missions abroad and by  the\r\n\r\nnatural   advantages  of  Singapore's   convenient\r\n\r\nlocation,  as  well as by other features,  as  for\r\n\r\nexample  the fact that Singapore is a  clean  city\r\n\r\nwith green and pleasant surroundings, and has also\r\n\r\na  reputation for being well-run. What stands  out\r\n\r\nas  a  particular  achievement  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTourist  Promotion  Board is the  discovery  of  a\r\n\r\nrather  controversial location  for  Sir  Stamford\r\n\r\nRaffles' landing. Other contributions to tradition\r\n\r\nand  cultural development do not seem  to  prevail\r\n\r\nvery  much.  It is interesting to note  that  more\r\n\r\ntourists   from  ASEAN  countries   are   visiting\r\n\r\nSingapore. Let us show them that we are  conscious\r\n\r\nof  our own history and commendable past and  that\r\n\r\nwe appreciate the finer forms of expression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help in this, I would like to bring up the\r\n\r\nview  held by many that some part of the  proceeds\r\n\r\nfrom the cess levied on tourist establishments  he\r\n\r\ngiven  over  for  the patronage  of  artistic  and\r\n\r\ncultural development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget statement sounded a note of firm\r\n\r\nconfidence in the face of continued uncertainty in\r\n\r\nworld  economic conditions. We show confidence  in\r\n\r\nourselves and we know that others are confident in\r\n\r\nus.  And this I say to our people: let us  not  do\r\n\r\nanything to affect this confidence in any way. The\r\n\r\nMember  for Changi has, during the debate  on  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address, expressed his  concern  over\r\n\r\nthe  possibility  of  Communist  exploitation   of\r\n\r\neconomic  uncertainties as well  as  of  come-back\r\n\r\nattempts by right-wing political opportunists. The\r\n\r\nMember   for  Boon  Teck  has  also  referred   to\r\n\r\nunwelcome  interference by \"ugly  adventurers\"  in\r\n\r\nour internal political affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too long ago we witnessed at the University\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  some  manifestations  of   student\r\n\r\nunrest.  In  respect of students  experiencing  an\r\n\r\nawakening within their souls to the realities of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconditions in the adult world they find themselves\r\n\r\nin,  the  members of our society should look  upon\r\n\r\nthis  with some gratification. We should not  feel\r\n\r\ntoo perturbed or surprised even over our discovery\r\n\r\nof   evidence  of  intellectual  activity  at  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Singapore. We should be happy  that\r\n\r\nour   undergraduates  are  studiously   exercising\r\n\r\nthemselves  over moral issues as to  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nsociety  we  should have and the  right  relations\r\n\r\nbetween man and man in our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we should also remember that the\r\n\r\nstudent movement is the easiest thing in the world\r\n\r\nfor those with unwholesome intentions to penetrate\r\n\r\nsilently  and  surreptitiously. In the  spring  of\r\n\r\n1967,   Ramparts   magazine   published   a   most\r\n\r\nsignificantly revealing report. The report claimed\r\n\r\nthat  the  (American) National Student Association\r\n\r\n(NSA),  to which was affiliated student unions  on\r\n\r\nmore than 300 campuses all over the United States,\r\n\r\nhad  been  subsidised for 15  years  past  by  the\r\n\r\nCentral Intelligence Agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This support from the CIA had been to counter\r\n\r\nSoviet  influence  in  the  international  student\r\n\r\nmovement, which had been evident since as far back\r\n\r\nas 1946, when Communist delegations gained control\r\n\r\nof  the first World Student Congress, which met in\r\n\r\nPrague. More recently, there is also a fair amount\r\n\r\nof  evidence  of  Communist  penetrations  of  the\r\n\r\nStudents for a Democratic Society (SDS). In an odd\r\n\r\nway  our  own  students show  they  realise  their\r\n\r\nvulnerability   to   penetration   by   constantly\r\n\r\nexpressing  their  fear  of  subversion   by   our\r\n\r\nInternal Security Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, our students, especially those just\r\n\r\nentering  university,  should  be  warned  against\r\n\r\nbeing pawns of shadowy individuals lurking in  the\r\n\r\nbackground.  These  individuals,  while  espousing\r\n\r\nhumanistic aims and individual freedom,  cynically\r\n\r\nexploit the difficulties our idealistic youths are\r\n\r\nfacing in their struggle to relate the first flush\r\n\r\nof   new  ideas  and  exciting  thoughts  to   the\r\n\r\nrealities    of   their   social   and   political\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the university recent attempts at expressing\r\n\r\ndissent  have followed a well-beaten path, trodden\r\n\r\nover and over again by student dissenters all over\r\n\r\nthe  world.  Sing-along sessions, the pretence  of\r\n\r\nhumanism  hiding the incitement to hate, making  a\r\n\r\ncomrade  of  Christ, and Messiahs out  of  student\r\n\r\nofficials,  the  manufacturing  of  martyrs,   the\r\n\r\ndesanctification of authority and the  attempt  to\r\n\r\npour  scorn on social institutions, including  the\r\n\r\njudiciary    directly,   and    even    Parliament\r\n\r\nindirectly, attempts at disruption and willingness\r\n\r\nto  drop out: the pattern is very clear. Our young\r\n\r\nmen  and women entering into university should  be\r\n\r\nwarned  against being made use of by those who  do\r\n\r\nnot wish us any good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to the more pedestrian domain of\r\n\r\nour  school  system. Of course, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance has made reference to some sectors of  our\r\n\r\neducation  system which are directly  relevant  to\r\n\r\nmanpower  training and are in this way immediately\r\n\r\nrelated   to  economic  progress.  He   has   thus\r\n\r\nexpressed  his  concern over the  relationship  of\r\n\r\neducation  to work and certainly this is  a  right\r\n\r\nconcern. But there are other aspects of the formal\r\n\r\neducational  system not immediately  and  patently\r\n\r\nseen  as  having economic significance which  will\r\n\r\nhave in the long run very important effects on our\r\n\r\neconomic   and  social  well-being.  This   should\r\n\r\nconcern  us  especially in view of our President's\r\n\r\ninjunction  not  too long ago that  we  should  be\r\n\r\nguided  by  the  long-term interests  of  all  our\r\n\r\npeople. I feel certain there are features  in  our\r\n\r\neducation  establishment  and  implementation   of\r\n\r\neducation policy, which may in the long  run  tend\r\n\r\nto  result in diseconomies than in efficiency  and\r\n\r\noptimum  output. I refer to the way  measures  are\r\n\r\nintroduced and dropped and new measures thought of\r\n\r\nand  introduced  in  bewildering  succession.   In\r\n\r\nNovember  1974  an  official  statement   on   the\r\n\r\nrestructure  of the education system averred  that\r\n\r\nour  Republic's  education  system  had  been   in\r\n\r\noperation  for the past 15 years with  only  minor\r\n\r\nchanges. This statement has resulted in my\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwondering  whether I have rightly  understood  the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of `major' and `minor'. But even  if  the\r\n\r\nchanges  have not been major and have indeed  been\r\n\r\nminor as alleged, then there have been so many  of\r\n\r\nthem  introduced, and in a patchwork way, that  it\r\n\r\nwas  right for the Member for Ulu Pandan  to  call\r\n\r\nout for a moratorium on these changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us sit down to think carefully of what we\r\n\r\nwant to do and let us do it together, teachers and\r\n\r\nadministrators -not the bureaucrats alone. Let not\r\n\r\npolicy  be decided in some obscure bureau and  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  teachers  and their  unions  and  other\r\n\r\nprofessional  bodies be sought  merely  to  ensure\r\n\r\nsmooth implementation of a new system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 1968 a point was made in this House\r\n\r\nin    respect    of   decision-making    regarding\r\n\r\neducational  policy. It was said that  when  plans\r\n\r\nwere  made not enough of the opinion of  the  rank\r\n\r\nand file of the teachers had been solicited and it\r\n\r\nwas  pointed  out  that without  discussion  there\r\n\r\ncould not be that full and wholehearted commitment\r\n\r\nto implementation. I myself appealed in this House\r\n\r\nseven  years ago, that whenever decisions were  to\r\n\r\nbe made, whenever plans were to be laid, we needed\r\n\r\nmore   than  a  resigned  acquiescence  to   these\r\n\r\ndecisions  and  plans. We needed the participation\r\n\r\nof  our  teachers  in  the  thinking  out  of  our\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Mr Speaker, Sir, this response of resigned\r\n\r\nacquiescence  to  decisions is still  there.  What\r\n\r\nother  response  can there be when  decisions  are\r\n\r\nstill  made  and policies thrust on  teachers  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  implement and their views are  canvassed\r\n\r\nonly in respect of smooth implementation. Where is\r\n\r\nthe  optimum  productivity  possible  under  these\r\n\r\nconditions?  How  is  the  best  economic   effort\r\n\r\nachieved in the education sector?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another matter which is related to\r\n\r\nwhat  I  would  like to think of as  the  economic\r\n\r\ndisposition of educational resources.  Why  is  it\r\n\r\nthat  we try to contrive an input of all sorts  of\r\n\r\nknowledge,    possible   and   impossible,    into\r\n\r\nschooling? The reason for this is that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  visualise the formal school as the only place\r\n\r\nwhere  learning should occur. That is why we  tend\r\n\r\nto ask: Why has history been dropped? There is not\r\n\r\nenough   second-language  time.  Why  not  include\r\n\r\nconsumer    education,   even   family    planning\r\n\r\neducation,  safety  first education  perhaps,  and\r\n\r\nother  things?  If we could only  realise  clearly\r\n\r\nthat  education is for life, then  we  could  take\r\n\r\nmore  positive  steps to integrate  a  humane  and\r\n\r\ncivic education into the working and adult life of\r\n\r\nour citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, in the out-of-school sector, we have\r\n\r\ndone  very  well  indeed in the  establishment  of\r\n\r\ninstitutions  devoted to the improvement  of  work\r\n\r\nskills.   But  where  education  for   living   is\r\n\r\nconcerned  the time that we have at our  disposal,\r\n\r\nif  we  think only of school, is quite inadequate.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  think of other structures  to  bring\r\n\r\nabout  with effect and impact what is incorporated\r\n\r\nin the Chinese saying - Huo tao lao, hsueh tao lao\r\n\r\n- Live till old, learn till old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that let me turn to the way priorities seem\r\n\r\nto  be ordered in the minds of those who decide on\r\n\r\nthe   Budget  for  items  that  are  not   related\r\n\r\nimmediately to economic returns, but which are all\r\n\r\nthe same important and have a long-term effect  on\r\n\r\nthe  way  our people live, learn, train, work  and\r\n\r\nearn,   and   hence   on  the  way   we   progress\r\n\r\neconomically  and  otherwise. Let  us  take.,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the example of neglect of the  National\r\n\r\nMuseum.  It  is  depressing  to  contemplate  this\r\n\r\naspect  and  I  intend to say a  little  bit  more\r\n\r\nduring Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the National Library. There has\r\n\r\nbeen  a spate of resignations recently of officers\r\n\r\nin   the   library  service.  Further  alarm   and\r\n\r\ndespondency  has been spread among senior  library\r\n\r\nofficers  by  certain proposals  relating  to  so-called  economy and efficiency measures  that,  if\r\n\r\nimplemented  without  careful  consideration,  may\r\n\r\nwell  result  in hampering the optimum development\r\n\r\nof our library services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even where the traffic police are concerned,\r\n\r\nsuggestions have been made to them to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nstrength of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmobile squad. This has been done apparently in the\r\n\r\nnaive  belief that the introduction of the  points\r\n\r\ndemerit system, restricted entry into the CBD, and\r\n\r\nother  new traffic regulations, will enable  fewer\r\n\r\nmen  to do more work. By such crude economies,  is\r\n\r\nit  hoped  that  the traffic police  will  achieve\r\n\r\nwhat,  up  to the present, has patently  not  been\r\n\r\nachieved, namely, adequate volume of enforcement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite evident that when our budget\r\n\r\nauthorities   (wherever  they  are)   budget   for\r\n\r\nenterprises  that are not immediately economically\r\n\r\nproductive,  they tend to think  of  manpower  and\r\n\r\nother  operating  factors in  terms  of  reducible\r\n\r\ndigits.  In  the Memorandum to the  Estimates,  we\r\n\r\nlearn   that  half  the  rationale  behind  latest\r\n\r\nimprovements to the Estimates format is to  enable\r\n\r\nclassification of Government expenditure according\r\n\r\nto  the economic impact of an expenditure. My  own\r\n\r\nobservation inclines me to believe that, in  cases\r\n\r\nof  expenditure where there is not  an  immediate,\r\n\r\npatent, quantifiable economic impact, then this is\r\n\r\nseized   upon   as  justification  for   automatic\r\n\r\npruning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There does not seem to be much readiness to think\r\n\r\nin  terms of dimensions of a problem, or the  aims\r\n\r\nof  a project - what it is hoped to attain by  it.\r\n\r\nProductivity is demanded in a simple way:  greater\r\n\r\noutput  with fewer digits. This is like the father\r\n\r\nin  a  family  economising by giving his  children\r\n\r\nless  to  eat.  Whether they  will  do  more  work\r\n\r\nbecause  they are lean, or much less because  they\r\n\r\nare  starving  - this may well be  a  less  simple\r\n\r\njudgment to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a look is taken at productivity, it may be\r\n\r\nall   too   easy  to  come  to  facile,   unctuous\r\n\r\nconclusion  about the necessity for  pruning.  One\r\n\r\nhas to guard against this mistake. For example,  I\r\n\r\nhad  occasion,  only  a few  days  ago,  to  visit\r\n\r\nFullerton Building. There I passed a department of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance. While waiting, I  saw  a\r\n\r\nfew  of  the  staff of this department, sauntering\r\n\r\nbetween  desks,  lounging, and  talking  with  one\r\n\r\nanother, full of smiles. But I said to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmyself: \"My, these workers are indeed happy.  They\r\n\r\nmust surely be owing this happiness to the efforts\r\n\r\nof the Management Services Department.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Minister will\r\n\r\nallow, I would like to comment on the bland way in\r\n\r\nwhich the Minister presented his Budget statement.\r\n\r\nThere was no break in this bland quality even when\r\n\r\nhe   came  to  the  part  where  he  talked  about\r\n\r\nadditional  revenue having to come from  increased\r\n\r\ntaxes  on  items, 1 quote, \"not basic to life  for\r\n\r\nthe average family\". This imposition was, I think,\r\n\r\ngreeted  with  mixed  feelings  on  the  part   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  - a little irritation mixed  with  a\r\n\r\nlittle relief: relief that the imposition had  not\r\n\r\nbeen  heavier because there were rumours that  the\r\n\r\ntax  on  cars, for example, would be high  indeed.\r\n\r\nAnd  a  little irritation because at least one  of\r\n\r\nthese items, namely the car, is not considered  so\r\n\r\nmuch  a  luxury,  under present circumstances,  as\r\n\r\nalmost  a  necessity to large numbers  of  people,\r\n\r\njudging  by the perennial parking problem even  in\r\n\r\nHDB  precincts and other places where the  average\r\n\r\ncitizen  dwells. The principal way to make  people\r\n\r\nless  attached to their cars is to make travelling\r\n\r\nin public transport so much less deterring than it\r\n\r\nis  today,  that people will not mind  sacrificing\r\n\r\nthe use of private vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that one aim of the imposition\r\n\r\nof   additional  road  tax  is  to  add   to   the\r\n\r\ndiscouragement  of individual car ownership.  Most\r\n\r\npeople  feel, however, that this measure will  not\r\n\r\nsucceed  -  and  the people who feel  so  are  the\r\n\r\npeople who own the cars. I appreciate that  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary,  in  order to make public  transport  a\r\n\r\nsuccess,  to  ensure  a high volume  of  users  of\r\n\r\npublic  transport,  who will later  patronise  the\r\n\r\nmass rapid transit system. Thus it is necessary to\r\n\r\ndiscourage   individual  car  ownership   wherever\r\n\r\npossible. And I support all encouragement given to\r\n\r\nthe use of public transport. But apart from quasi-punitive  measures, it is a positive  and  radical\r\n\r\ntransformation of the public transport system that\r\n\r\nwill eventually turn people to its use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should not forget the revenue-collecting purpose behind the imposition of the\r\n\r\nadditional  car tax. A respectable $26 million  is\r\n\r\nanticipated. But the burden will be chiefly  borne\r\n\r\nby  those who own small and medium-sized cars.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  interesting to know how many  of  these\r\n\r\nowners also run small and medium-sized businesses.\r\n\r\nIt  is  hoped that, in such cases, the taxes  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  passed  on  to the consumer,  in  another\r\n\r\nlittle boost to inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially as the Government has, by its own\r\n\r\nmeasures,  done its part, otherwise, in  arresting\r\n\r\nthe  rate of inflation. Comparing 1974 with  1973,\r\n\r\nthe  rate  of increase in the cost of  living  has\r\n\r\nslowed    down   significantly.   However,    food\r\n\r\ncontributes  nearly  60%  to  increases   in   the\r\n\r\nConsumer  Price Index. There is reason, therefore,\r\n\r\nfor  us  to welcome the coming Government campaign\r\n\r\nto  drive home the message that good food need not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  mean the higher priced food.  Success\r\n\r\nin  the  campaign will not only help the housewife\r\n\r\nin  her domestic bud-getting but will perhaps also\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards  pegging  down  general   food\r\n\r\nprices  somewhat. I wonder, though, if  we  should\r\n\r\nnot  give thought to the possibility that  success\r\n\r\nin   increasing   the  demand   for   lower-priced\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs   might  send  the  prices   of   these\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs up a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the whole, there is very\r\n\r\nlittle doubt that the Government has done well for\r\n\r\nthe citizens who gave it their mandate. And it  is\r\n\r\ngeared  under present recessionary conditions,  to\r\n\r\nmaintain a fair rate of development. The Estimates\r\n\r\nshow  nearly a 50% increase, in FY 75 over FY  74,\r\n\r\nin  Government's direct expenditure on development\r\n\r\n(excluding  expenditure  on  the  Armed   Forces).\r\n\r\nSignificantly  a sum representing about  one-tenth\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of  this direct expenditure  will  be\r\n\r\nspent   on  public  works,  especially  roadworks,\r\n\r\nnecessitated  by  development of  housing.  Nearly\r\n\r\n$850  million  has  gone into loans  for  housing.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nearly a 40% increase in the amount  of\r\n\r\nloans to Statutory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoards  and Companies, including over $700 million\r\n\r\nin the Ministry of Finance's\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the catalogue goes on, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nThe  Budget papers indeed make fascinating reading\r\n\r\nand  I  would recommend them to anybody who is  in\r\n\r\nneed  of  a  morale booster, for they  detail  our\r\n\r\nachievement  and they show our faith in  ourselves\r\n\r\nand our hope for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\n1974,  as  we know, was a year of economic  crisis\r\n\r\nfor  non-oil  producers among  the  industrialised\r\n\r\ncountries  and  the developing  countries  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  The  energy  crisis,  exacerbated  by  the\r\n\r\nsudden  quadrupling of oil prices, had a crippling\r\n\r\neffect on the economies of the industrialised bloc\r\n\r\nand  the  third  world. The oil consuming  nations\r\n\r\nsuddenly  had  to  grapple with a  grave  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.  Forecasts of zero, and even minus  growth\r\n\r\nrates of GNPs of industrialised nations were made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst this grim scenario of economic crisis, the\r\n\r\nHon.   Finance  Minister,  in  his  annual  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement on 3rd March, 1975, announced  that  our\r\n\r\nreal  rate  of  growth in 1974 was 6.8%.  This  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  a  satisfactory  economic  performance,\r\n\r\nparticularly, when our economy, which is a trading\r\n\r\nand  export-orientated economy, is very much  more\r\n\r\nsusceptible  and  vulnerable  to  changes  in  the\r\n\r\npattern   of   global  economic  activities   than\r\n\r\npractically  every other country.  Even  the  most\r\n\r\nvocal  critics of Government could not grudge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  the  compliments for the  satisfactory\r\n\r\nperformance  of our economy in 1974. Only  prudent\r\n\r\nmanagement  and sound planning coupled with  able,\r\n\r\ndetermined political leadership and courage  could\r\n\r\nhave  made  possible such an achievement.  Let  me\r\n\r\njoin   in   with  the  many  voices   that   offer\r\n\r\ncongratulations to the Hon. Finance  Minister  and\r\n\r\nhis   Cabinet  colleagues  on  their  past  year's\r\n\r\nperformance  and express confidence of  witnessing\r\n\r\nour   country's  continued  success  under   their\r\n\r\nstewardship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me hasten to add that I am\r\n\r\nnot   without   any   criticisms   regarding   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   policies  and   the   annual   Budget\r\n\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Finance Minister would have been given\r\n\r\nmore  accolades if he had made some  announcements\r\n\r\nof  further  incentives for people who support  or\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards  the  support  of  their  aged\r\n\r\nparents and grandparents. After all, there was  so\r\n\r\nmuch  fanfare  in the President's Address  at  the\r\n\r\nopening  of  the present Session of Parliament  of\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention to encourage people to look\r\n\r\nafter  their aged parents and grandparents. Or  is\r\n\r\nthe  Hon.  Finance  Minister waiting  for  a  more\r\n\r\npropitious moment to make such announcements?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to his not-so-very generous offer of\r\n\r\ntax  concession  for  people  capable  of  working\r\n\r\nbeyond  55 years of age by increasing their earned\r\n\r\nincome  relief from the present $1,000  to  $2,000\r\n\r\nfor  those between 55 years and 60 years  of  age,\r\n\r\nand to $3,000 for those more than 60 years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to him, from our experience of the\r\n\r\nvarious aspects of economic development during the\r\n\r\npast few years, it has become apparent that it  is\r\n\r\nextremely desirable from every point of view  that\r\n\r\nour  skilled  and  experienced  people  should  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to carry on working beyond their normal\r\n\r\nretirement age. Then he went on to say  that  such\r\n\r\npeople  will need to spend more money  on  medical\r\n\r\nattention  to  stay healthy and fit  for  working.\r\n\r\nHence,  the  tax concession is proposed  for  such\r\n\r\npeople  to  make it worth their while to  continue\r\n\r\nworking after the age of retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now examine his tax relief proposal to see\r\n\r\nwhether  such  tax  concession  would  in   effect\r\n\r\nachieve  what the Hon. Finance Minister  hopes  to\r\n\r\nachieve,   namely,   getting   our   skilled   and\r\n\r\nexperienced  people to go on working beyond  their\r\n\r\nretirement  age.  In  my  opinion,  and  with  due\r\n\r\nrespect  to the Minister, if there is any  problem\r\n\r\nabout  working  after retirement, it  is  not  the\r\n\r\nproblem of persuading retired persons to work. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  has  got hold of the wrong  end  of  the\r\n\r\nstick.  For many workers, particularly  those  who\r\n\r\nare  organised into trade unions, the  problem  is\r\n\r\nthat  of  getting work rather than being persuaded\r\n\r\nto  work  after  the age of retirement.  Singapore\r\n\r\nworkers  generally want to continue working  after\r\n\r\nreaching   the  age  of  retirement  because   the\r\n\r\nretirement age at 55 years is ridiculously low  in\r\n\r\nthe  present  context. With  better  standards  of\r\n\r\nhealth and of living, people at that age are still\r\n\r\nhale and hearty, and feel fit to continue working,\r\n\r\nnot  just only to maintain their economic  status,\r\n\r\nbut  also  to avoid the boredom of doing  nothing.\r\n\r\nBut  they  are  prevented by their employers  from\r\n\r\ncontinuing to work after attaining the  fixed  age\r\n\r\nof retirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, the reason is plain\r\n\r\neconomics  for the employer. In fact, an  employer\r\n\r\nmay  not even wait for the employee to retire  but\r\n\r\nretrench him before he has reached the top of  his\r\n\r\nsalary scale. The employer retires an old employee\r\n\r\nat  the  top  of his salary scale. With  the  same\r\n\r\namount of money he can employ three or four  young\r\n\r\ninexperienced employees at the bottom rung of  the\r\n\r\nsalary  scale.  This  is  sometimes  done  without\r\n\r\nconsideration  of  the  value  of  the  skill  and\r\n\r\nexperience  of  the old employee.  The  reason  is\r\n\r\nsimple. The personnel manager of a firm who is  in\r\n\r\ncharge of hiring and firing of the staff wants  to\r\n\r\nshow  his  general manager how much money  he  can\r\n\r\nsave  for  his company if he retires or retrenches\r\n\r\noff an old employee and recruits a young employee.\r\n\r\nAs  the  personnel  manager is not  in  charge  of\r\n\r\nproduction  and  is not concerned with  production\r\n\r\nefficiency and schedules which depend so  much  on\r\n\r\nskilled and experienced employees, the problem  he\r\n\r\ncreates has to be solved by others. The production\r\n\r\nmanager  and supervisor, who apparently  have  not\r\n\r\nmuch  say  in the hiring and firing of  employees,\r\n\r\nare  the  ones who have to solve the problem.  But\r\n\r\nsince they probably depend on the goodwill of  the\r\n\r\npersonnel  manager for their own job security  and\r\n\r\npromotions, they also prefer to keep their  wisdom\r\n\r\nto themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the public sector, the prospect for an\r\n\r\nemployee  on  reaching retiring  age  to  continue\r\n\r\nworking is just as grim. The civil service  ruling\r\n\r\non  retirement age has to be strictly adhered  to.\r\n\r\nTrue, in some cases, extension of service has been\r\n\r\nallowed,  but  on  a temporary basis  subject,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   to   the   ritual  of   annual   medical\r\n\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in the end, who are the people beyond 55 years\r\n\r\nof age likely to benefit from this tax concession?\r\n\r\nOnly the Lien Ying Chows, the Tan Chin Tuans,  the\r\n\r\nRunme Shaws, the tycoons, the big towkays and  the\r\n\r\nnot-so-big towkays are likely to benefit from  the\r\n\r\ntax  concession because, as bosses  of  their  own\r\n\r\nconcerns, they can continue to work beyond the age\r\n\r\nof  55  years until they literally drop dead.  And\r\n\r\nthe irony is that such people do not need such tax\r\n\r\nconcession  as  an incentive to continue  working.\r\n\r\nThere is no better incentive than that of personal\r\n\r\nprofits. I am quite sure the Government has  never\r\n\r\nintended to devise tax concessions to benefit such\r\n\r\npeople.  If they do benefit from it, it is  purely\r\n\r\nincidental and not deliberately intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then, may I ask, is the Government going to\r\n\r\nachieve  the objective of getting our skilled  and\r\n\r\nexperienced  people to go on working beyond  their\r\n\r\nnormal  retirement age just by  offering  the  tax\r\n\r\nconcession to such people as announced by the Hon.\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister? Will it not be  more  desirable\r\n\r\nand effective to raise the official retirement age\r\n\r\nof   55  to  60  for  a  start?  Should  not   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as  a  model  employer,  remove   the\r\n\r\nexisting  ridiculous  ruling  on  retirement  that\r\n\r\nGovernment employees who joined service before 1st\r\n\r\nJuly,  1956, should retire at the age of  55?  Why\r\n\r\nshould they retire at 55 when those who join after\r\n\r\nthat date can retire at the age of 60? Surely what\r\n\r\nis  sauce  for  the goose is also  sauce  for  the\r\n\r\ngander.  When you remove that ruling, you will  be\r\n\r\nable,  by  a  stroke  of the pen,  to  retain  the\r\n\r\nservices  of old public employees whose skill  and\r\n\r\nexperience  are  most  valuable  at  a  time  when\r\n\r\neverything is done not only to attract but also to\r\n\r\nprevent the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbrain and brawn drain into the private sector.  It\r\n\r\nis possible that a few may still want to retire at\r\n\r\n55 years of age. Give them an option to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the private sector the Government may\r\n\r\nachieve  the  same  result,  as  intended  by  the\r\n\r\nproposed  tax concession, by ensuring that  short-sighted or antisocial employers do not get rid  of\r\n\r\nexperienced, skilled workers at the top  of  their\r\n\r\nrespective wage scales before or on attaining  the\r\n\r\nage  of  55  years  simply for the  sake  of  some\r\n\r\nmonetary savings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Finance Minister, in his Budget\r\n\r\nstatement, referred to the marked slow-down in the\r\n\r\nrates  of  growth of revenue since financial  year\r\n\r\n1973.   In   the  coming  fiscal  year,  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is  expected to increase  by  6j%  as\r\n\r\nagainst  a  growth  of  only  5%  in  revenue.  He\r\n\r\nproposed to collect an additional revenue of $41.5\r\n\r\nmillion  by  way  of increased taxes  on  tobacco,\r\n\r\nliquor  and  cars, as he considered them  as  \"not\r\n\r\nbasic  to  life for the average family\". Basic  or\r\n\r\nnot  basic, the consumers of such items would have\r\n\r\nto  foot  the  bill for the increased  taxes  from\r\n\r\ntheir  hard-earned money. Many such consumers  are\r\n\r\nno  more than just ordinary wage earners who  work\r\n\r\nhard  and pay their taxes dutifully. They  do  not\r\n\r\nevade paying taxes, like so many hawkers and  some\r\n\r\ncrooked  businessmen  who  know  how  to  cook  up\r\n\r\nfigures to avoid paying their full taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not taking issue with the Hon. Finance Minister over the increased taxes. What I venture to do is to propose to him that next time if he wants more money, he should look into the Stock Market. I am not suggesting to him that he should use Government funds to speculate on the Stock Market and increase the State's revenue through profits derived from speculation. What I am proposing is that he should consider introducing a form of capital gains tax for business transactions of shares in the Stock Market. Look at the huge fortunes some of the speculators have amassed for themselves in the last two months. All they do is to pick up the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntelephone  and dial the number of their  favourite\r\n\r\nremisiers and speculate. What possible harm  could\r\n\r\na capital gains tax do to the Stock Market?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible argument against it is that it will\r\n\r\ndampen  the activities of the Stock Market.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  conscious of the fact that the Stock Market\r\n\r\nhas  a vital role to play in the economic life  of\r\n\r\nour  State. It provides opportunities for  genuine\r\n\r\ninvestors  both  big  and small  to  invest  their\r\n\r\nsavings,  which  in turn helps  to  stimulate  the\r\n\r\neconomic    growth   of   our    industrial    and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector of our economy. But  what  we\r\n\r\nhave  seen in our Stock Market activities  in  the\r\n\r\npast two months, for example, and on some previous\r\n\r\noccasions, was not anything like that, it was just\r\n\r\nsheer  speculation and gambling. A  tax  on  their\r\n\r\n\"winnings\" as an additional source of revenue  may\r\n\r\ncurb  speculation  but  not  investment.  If   the\r\n\r\nproposed capital gains tax is imposed on stock and\r\n\r\nshares  transactions  which are  resold  within  a\r\n\r\nperiod of, say, six months or a year, it will  not\r\n\r\naffect  the  genuine investors.  In  that  way,  a\r\n\r\ncapital  gains  tax  should not  be  objectionable\r\n\r\nexcept to the professional speculators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would like to congratulate the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nfor  his  usual  informative and  detailed  Budget\r\n\r\naddress  and  for having presented  such  a  vivid\r\n\r\npicture of our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the House was debating the Presidential\r\n\r\nAddress,  I touched on the implementation  process\r\n\r\nwithin the Government machinery and on the need to\r\n\r\nexamine  the  existing  administrative  system  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  where  changes are  urgently  required.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House  also  commented  on  the\r\n\r\nprofessional services, like the medical and health\r\n\r\nservices, the need for better coordination between\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments, and the need for  a  more\r\n\r\neffective and courteous civil service among  other\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our civil service is, by and large, one that we\r\n\r\ncan be proud of - non-corrupt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  in  comparison  with  many  others  a  fairly\r\n\r\nefficient  one. Nevertheless, there is still  room\r\n\r\nfor  improvement. Although Singapore has  been  an\r\n\r\nindependent country for 10 years now,  it  appears\r\n\r\nthat  the  tradition of Whitehall still  permeates\r\n\r\nthe civil service. Some officers, even very senior\r\n\r\nones, still carry out instructions and regulations\r\n\r\nto  the  letter without question or understanding.\r\n\r\nThey seldom exercise discretion and work more like\r\n\r\na  robot.  This  is  one of  the  main  causes  of\r\n\r\nfrustration  within the civil service  itself.  In\r\n\r\ndealing  with  the public, such an  impersonalised\r\n\r\nsystem  when  carried  too far  can  breed  public\r\n\r\ndiscontent   and  misunderstanding  -   not   with\r\n\r\nWhitehall   now,   but  with   our   own   elected\r\n\r\nGovernment. I will cite instances of such dealings\r\n\r\nunder the appropriate Ministries during the debate\r\n\r\non   the   Main   and  Development  Estimates   of\r\n\r\nExpenditure.   Today,   I  will   concentrate   on\r\n\r\nhighlighting some of the problems within the civil\r\n\r\nservice,  particularly involving the  professional\r\n\r\nservices  (the medical, scientific, technical  and\r\n\r\neducational  services), and I would like  to  make\r\n\r\ngeneral  recommendations on some of these problems\r\n\r\nand how they can be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that rapid development has created a\r\n\r\nmanpower shortage, particularly in the engineering\r\n\r\nand  technical fields. Many vacancies still  exist\r\n\r\nin  the service for these personnel, but I find it\r\n\r\ndifficult to accept the explanation that  shortage\r\n\r\nin  the public sector of professional staff is due\r\n\r\nto  pay alone. Not only few professionals join the\r\n\r\ncivil  service, many also resign from  it.  Surely\r\n\r\nnot  all  the doctors, engineers, technocrats  and\r\n\r\nteachers  who  resigned have done  so  because  of\r\n\r\nfinancial reason alone. I have no doubt that  many\r\n\r\nof these professionals who have left are dedicated\r\n\r\npeople  and  who, if given the proper opportunity,\r\n\r\nwould  also like to participate and contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe  exciting  challenge of nation  building.  The\r\n\r\nlarge number of volunteers who are now serving  on\r\n\r\nthe  various Government Boards and committees bear\r\n\r\ntestimony to this. Yet many professionals who have\r\n\r\njoined the civil service have left. Some left\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  they  have  been  totally  disillusioned.\r\n\r\nOthers  left because they were frustrated  by  the\r\n\r\nadministrative system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that among certain sections of the\r\n\r\nservice,  as mentioned by previous Members  before\r\n\r\nme,  money is all that matters. There is a  phobia\r\n\r\nto make money for the Government. There is also an\r\n\r\nover-emphasis on the control of public  funds,  so\r\n\r\nmuch   so   that   effective   implementation   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  policies  and  achieving  departmental\r\n\r\nobjectives   take  second  place  at  best.   This\r\n\r\npractice, if not checked, can be abused or misused\r\n\r\nresulting  very  frequently in  relatively  junior\r\n\r\nofficers   in   the   Budget   and   in   Ministry\r\n\r\nheadquarters over-riding even Heads of  Department\r\n\r\nor   very   senior  professional  officers.   Non-professionals    begin   to   dictate    to    the\r\n\r\nprofessionals    through   the   budget    system,\r\n\r\ncompletely  forgetting that the other parties  too\r\n\r\nhave responsibilities for the performance of their\r\n\r\nrespective  organisations. People usually  respect\r\n\r\nauthority  provided the authority is exercised  by\r\n\r\nsomeone  they  can respect, and not one  who  rams\r\n\r\nauthority down the throats of others by virtue  of\r\n\r\nthe position he holds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will cite a classical example. A request was\r\n\r\nmade  for a re-vote for a 50-cycle generator.  The\r\n\r\nreply was \"Re-vote for generator approved. Explain\r\n\r\nwhy  the  additional  50 bicycles  are  required\".\r\n\r\nAnother  example. A department needed an equipment\r\n\r\nto  generate  hot  air  for drying  purposes.  The\r\n\r\nrequest for a hair-dryer was disapproved. However,\r\n\r\na hot air blower was later supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can cite many instances, but I feel they are\r\n\r\nquite  unnecessary. They can only cause irritation\r\n\r\nand frustration. Let the professionals get down to\r\n\r\ntheir  job and let us devise a system to  minimise\r\n\r\nthese incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another source of frustration is the delegation\r\n\r\nof  authority  relating to funds. I agree  that  a\r\n\r\ndepartment's  allocation  should  depend  on   the\r\n\r\nnational budget, but surely the details of what is\r\n\r\nrequired after that should be left to the  man  in\r\n\r\ncharge and not to a complete layman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  Finance  Ministry. The irony  is  that  a\r\n\r\ndoctor  is  entrusted with people's lives  and  an\r\n\r\nengineer to design or supervise projects involving\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars; yet these same people are not\r\n\r\ntrusted with even small sums of money. They cannot\r\n\r\nvire  even  a  few hundred dollars  without  prior\r\n\r\napproval  from  the Treasury. This practice  often\r\n\r\ntakes  a  long time to be approved as  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnormally  encouraged. Surely, this is  unnecessary\r\n\r\nunless someone is trying to preserve his authority\r\n\r\nor  protect  his  job. Proposals for  budgets  are\r\n\r\nusually made months in advance. No one can predict\r\n\r\naccurately what exactly will be required.  Changes\r\n\r\nare  inevitable,  but  they are  difficult  to  be\r\n\r\neffected  under  the  present  system.  It  is  an\r\n\r\nestablished fact that very often things are bought\r\n\r\nand  money spent merely because they appear on the\r\n\r\nbudget,  even though the items may not be required\r\n\r\nany more. Departments that leave money unspent run\r\n\r\nthe  risk  of their following year's budget  being\r\n\r\nreduced.  This is a well known fact. No credit  is\r\n\r\ngiven  to officers for saving money. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  officer may even be considered  a  bad\r\n\r\nplanner who cannot even estimate accurately. There\r\n\r\nmust be tremendous wastage of public funds in this\r\n\r\nway  because  of  the  negative  approach  of  the\r\n\r\npresent system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Development Estimates, large sums of money\r\n\r\nare left unspent each year. It will be interesting\r\n\r\nto  know from the Finance Minister how much  money\r\n\r\nand  what  percentage of the development fund  are\r\n\r\nleft  unspent  each  year.  Besides  shortage   of\r\n\r\nmanpower  in certain areas, what other causes  are\r\n\r\nresponsible for these hold-ups? Valuable  time  is\r\n\r\nalso  lost in this process. Projects are  delayed.\r\n\r\nCan the system be improved to reduce this? What is\r\n\r\nbeing done to remedy this situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the implementation of Government policies and\r\n\r\nprogrammes  is badly handled by just a  few  civil\r\n\r\nservants   because  of  the  system,  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nfrustration can result within the service and with\r\n\r\nthe  public. We need a good civil service, we need\r\n\r\nto  rapidly  build up the vital second echelon  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service.  I would  therefore  like  to\r\n\r\npropose that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis House either directs the Estimates Committee,\r\n\r\nor  forms a high powered commission, to look  into\r\n\r\nthe   present  budgetting  and  financial  control\r\n\r\nsystem and:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To recommend measures to improve the existing\r\n\r\nsystem  and  reduce friction and  dissatisfaction;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To determine which departments should be made\r\n\r\nautonomous  to  take them out of the  bureaucratic\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently we read in the newspapers of the\r\n\r\nrecommendation to set up the Department  of  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation as a statutory board. I believe that  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of this very important Department  and\r\n\r\nour   Air  Terminal  could  have  been  very  much\r\n\r\naccelerated, if not for the bureaucracy involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating that we dismantle the entire\r\n\r\nsystem  which  has  worked  so  far.  What  I   am\r\n\r\nsuggesting is that we must not be blinded  by  our\r\n\r\nsuccess  and ignore the weaknesses and  faults  in\r\n\r\nthe  system which, in the long run, can stifle its\r\n\r\ngrowth. I salute the dedicated civil servants  who\r\n\r\nhad  stuck  to  the service through the  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes  we  had gone through the last 15 years.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time we must recognise the problems  and\r\n\r\nmake the necessary changes to continuously improve\r\n\r\nthe service. As we enter the technological age and\r\n\r\nunder rapid changes, new priorities and programmes\r\n\r\nwould require a civil service that is dynamic  and\r\n\r\nresponsive  to  the needs of the times,  ready  to\r\n\r\nmeet and surmount new challenges. As a responsible\r\n\r\nGovernment,   we   must  govern  firmly,   wisely,\r\n\r\nefficiently,  but  also  politely.  We   need   an\r\n\r\neffective civil service at all times to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.34 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to join my colleagues in congratulating\r\n\r\nthe  Government for guiding the nation  through  a\r\n\r\nvery   difficult  year.  Although  we  have   been\r\n\r\naffected by worldwide inflation and a slowing down\r\n\r\nin    economic   activities,   our   economy   has\r\n\r\nnevertheless  emerged with an impressive  gain  of\r\n\r\n6.8% in GDP and we are still able to show a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurplus   of  $708  million  in  our  balance   of\r\n\r\npayments.  This is impressive by any standard  and\r\n\r\nhas been due largely to the far-sightedness of our\r\n\r\npolitical   leadership  in  embarking   upon   the\r\n\r\nrestructuring and diversification of  our  economy\r\n\r\nover  the  past decade so as to give it a  broader\r\n\r\nbase.  It is this broad base that has provided  us\r\n\r\nwith the cushion to withstand the series of shocks\r\n\r\ngenerated by external forces. The tough-mindedness\r\n\r\nand resourcefulness of our business community with\r\n\r\ntheir  traditional \"do or die\" attitude have  also\r\n\r\ncontributed in no small measure to our success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In going through the economic survey one cannot\r\n\r\nhelp   but  feel  that,  in  out  enthusiasm   for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and in developing Singapore into\r\n\r\na  financial  centre over the past few  years,  we\r\n\r\nmight  not  have  given sufficient  attention  and\r\n\r\ncredit   to  some  of  our  traditional   economic\r\n\r\nactivities. It takes a difficult year such as  the\r\n\r\none  just  passed to impress on us  the  important\r\n\r\nrole  played by some of these traditional  sectors\r\n\r\nof  our  economy.  I  have  in  mind  particularly\r\n\r\ntourism  and  entrepot trade.  In  both  areas,  I\r\n\r\nsubmit, Sir, encouragement and incentives have not\r\n\r\nbeen  adequately  provided  in  recent  years.  If\r\n\r\nanything,  the  combined effect of the  series  of\r\n\r\nunilateral  government  departmental  actions  has\r\n\r\nresulted in drastic increase in day-to-day running\r\n\r\nexpenses, much to the dismay and distress  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  concerned. For example,  in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nhotel   trade,  the  increase  in  PUB  and  other\r\n\r\ngovernment  charges has imposed quite considerable\r\n\r\nfinancial  strains  on the management,  especially\r\n\r\nbearing  in mind the already substantial increases\r\n\r\nin  wages in recent years. From enquiries  made  I\r\n\r\nhave  been told that there are altogether some  20\r\n\r\nitems  of  licences  and  other  fees  payable  to\r\n\r\napproximately  nine  to ten Government  and  quasi\r\n\r\ngovernment departments by a hotel in the course of\r\n\r\nany  one year. Some of these fees and charges  are\r\n\r\npayable yearly whereas a number of them are  on  a\r\n\r\nmonthly basis and require personal visits  to  the\r\n\r\ndepartments  concerned. You can well  imagine  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime  involved in attending to all these payments.\r\n\r\nAnd  what is the Tourist Promotion Board doing  in\r\n\r\nliving  up to its name? According to the Minister,\r\n\r\na  sum of $3 million has been collected from hotel\r\n\r\ncess.  I do like to know how this amount is  being\r\n\r\nspent in promoting tourism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, according to the Tourist Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard's  report for the year 1971/1972, the  total\r\n\r\ncess collection for that year was estimated to  be\r\n\r\nin  the region of $5.9 million. What has accounted\r\n\r\nfor  the substantial drop some three years later'?\r\n\r\nFrankly  I  have my doubts as to the effectiveness\r\n\r\nof  the  Board.  The increase  in  the  number  of\r\n\r\nvisitors  to Singapore - I agree with  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Katong  ~ has perhaps been due  more  to  the\r\n\r\npromotion   efforts  of  SIA  and  other   private\r\n\r\norganisations than to the efforts of  the  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board. If this is the case, then what is\r\n\r\nthe    justification    for    the    cess?    The\r\n\r\nineffectiveness of the Board is amply demonstrated\r\n\r\nby the fact that the most up-to-date report of the\r\n\r\nBoard  is  for  the  year 1971/1972,  three  years\r\n\r\nbehind time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an organisation whose primary function is\r\n\r\npublic  relations, I would have thought  that  the\r\n\r\npublication  of annual reports is a matter  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken seriously and not just perfunctorily. A well\r\n\r\nprepared  and  up-to-date report I should  imagine\r\n\r\ncan be used most effectively for publicity purpose\r\n\r\nabroad   and  may  save  us  some  money  on   the\r\n\r\nproduction of other promotion brochures. There  is\r\n\r\nI  feel an urgent need to re-examine the role  and\r\n\r\nfunction  of the Tourist Promotion Board.  In  the\r\n\r\narea   of   entrepot  trade,  traders  have   also\r\n\r\nexperienced much higher running expenses: just  to\r\n\r\nmention a few - higher storage charges both at PSA\r\n\r\nand private godowns, higher transportation charges\r\n\r\nand  much  higher bank interest rates  during  the\r\n\r\nyear caused by tight credit squeeze. The last item\r\n\r\nhas  squeezed the life out of many traders and the\r\n\r\nhigh  cost  of money has affected all and  sundry,\r\n\r\nwhatever  their activities. Surely it is possible,\r\n\r\nand in my opinion necessary, for the Govern-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nment  in   introducing  any  fiscal  or  monetary\r\n\r\nmeasures  to differentiate those making a positive\r\n\r\ncontribution from those making a negative  one  to\r\n\r\nour economy. Any hasty decision aiming at internal\r\n\r\nadministrative  convenience  without  an  in-depth\r\n\r\nstudy  of  the  possible adverse  consequences  is\r\n\r\nlikely  in  the long run to result in disincentive\r\n\r\nand to cause loss of confidence on the part of the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has touched on the setting up of the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Activation Committee. In welcoming  this\r\n\r\nmove,  may  I  suggest that apart from  any  other\r\n\r\npurposes contemplated the Committee be directed to\r\n\r\nreview Government policies or the lack of policies\r\n\r\ntowards some of our traditional activities, with a\r\n\r\nview  to  ensuring  that they do receive  adequate\r\n\r\nsupport  and incentives if need be and  that  such\r\n\r\nactivities  are not unduly disturbed or  disrupted\r\n\r\non  account of thoughtless action on the  part  of\r\n\r\nany   particular  Government  or  quasi-government\r\n\r\ndepartments.  May I also suggest that  any  future\r\n\r\nincreases  in  Government charges or any  official\r\n\r\nmeasures  likely  to result in  heavier  financial\r\n\r\nburdens to the public be referred to the Committee\r\n\r\nso  that the question of justification as well  as\r\n\r\ntheir  wider  implications may be more  thoroughly\r\n\r\nand  objectively assessed. In this way perhaps  we\r\n\r\ncan look forward to a better co-ordinated approach\r\n\r\non  the  part  of  the Government in  all  matters\r\n\r\naffecting the growth of our economy and  the  cost\r\n\r\nof  living of our people. I should clarify that in\r\n\r\nputting  forward my views I have no  intention  of\r\n\r\nseeking subsidies for our business community.  Our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  are  hard-headed  and  certainly  not\r\n\r\nwithout  backbone, initiative or drive. What  they\r\n\r\nask  for  is  fairness, better  understanding  and\r\n\r\ngreater appreciation on the part of the Government\r\n\r\nof   the  mounting  problems  encountered  in   an\r\n\r\nincreasingly more difficult and competitive world.\r\n\r\nSome of these problems are beyond them and do call\r\n\r\nfor Government support and attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite our global concept in economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment it is evident that the ASEAN community\r\n\r\nof nations will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremain   our  most  important  partners   in   our\r\n\r\ncontinued  endeavours for greater economic  growth\r\n\r\nin  the  years ahead. With improved relations  and\r\n\r\nthe  general  realisation  of  the  need  and  the\r\n\r\nimportance   of  interdependence  throughout   the\r\n\r\nregion,  we can look forward and should  work  for\r\n\r\nthe   closest  cooperation.  We  should  join  our\r\n\r\nfriends  in identifying areas that are capable  of\r\n\r\ncoordinated   developments.   In   the   area   of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  there  is  a   growing   public\r\n\r\nsentiment that in recent years the Government does\r\n\r\nnot  appear to have done enough in promoting local\r\n\r\nparticipation. Whatever incentives that have  been\r\n\r\nformulated with the foreign investors in  mind,  I\r\n\r\nfeel it is important to ensure that a fair balance\r\n\r\nis  struck between foreign investments on the  one\r\n\r\nhand  and local on the other. The setting up of  a\r\n\r\nbureau  for  joint  ventures is  therefore  to  be\r\n\r\nwelcomed,  but  in  all joint ventures  we  should\r\n\r\nensure   that   the   arrangements   between   the\r\n\r\ninterested parties are such that our own nationals\r\n\r\nwill  have an opportunity to participate  actively\r\n\r\nin the day-to-day affairs of the companies so that\r\n\r\nover a period of time they will be able to acquire\r\n\r\nthe  necessary expertise and the managerial skills\r\n\r\nwhich are so essential to our further growth. Past\r\n\r\nyears' experience has shown that over-reliance  on\r\n\r\nmulti-nationals  tied to only  one  or  two  major\r\n\r\nmarkets  abroad does not do us much  good  from  a\r\n\r\nlong  term point of view but it is likely to cause\r\n\r\nsocial and economic instability from time to time.\r\n\r\nIn  our  continued endeavours to  attract  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment,  we should therefore aim  for  greater\r\n\r\ndiversification not only in terms of the types  of\r\n\r\noperations   but  also  market  dependencies.   At\r\n\r\npresent we seem to be concentrating our investment\r\n\r\npromotion efforts rather too heavily in the United\r\n\r\nStates. This is reflected by the fact that out  of\r\n\r\na  total of nine centres three or four are in  the\r\n\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at our international trading position\r\n\r\nit  is disturbing to note the widening trade  gaps\r\n\r\nwith  our  three  major partners,  namely,  Japan,\r\n\r\nAmerica  and  the EEC countries. The  gap  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Japan is parti\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncularly alarming, amounting to some $2,000 million\r\n\r\nin Japan's favour, followed by EEC's $900 million,\r\n\r\nand  thirdly USA's $757 million. We do not ask for\r\n\r\nthe  so-called \"most favoured nation\" status.  All\r\n\r\nthat   we  want  is  equity  and  reciprocity   in\r\n\r\ninternational  trade. I do like to know  what  the\r\n\r\nMinister proposes to do to narrow the trade gap in\r\n\r\neach case, especially in the case of Japan. Surely\r\n\r\nthey cannot take us for granted just because we do\r\n\r\nnot  show our dissatisfaction in a violent  manner\r\n\r\nas  some  people  do. The fact that  part  of  the\r\n\r\nimbalance may be due to our increased spending  on\r\n\r\ncapital  goods does not in my opinion  lessen  the\r\n\r\nobligation on the part of our trading partners  to\r\n\r\ntry to correct the unsatisfactory position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning now to the proposed tax increases, I\r\n\r\nthink  you  will agree that the Budget  this  year\r\n\r\ncannot be described as a painless one. What little\r\n\r\nconcession offered has limited appeal, and appears\r\n\r\nto  contradict the announced intention to make  it\r\n\r\nmore  attractive for young couples to  have  their\r\n\r\nparents  stay with them. On the one  hand  we  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  would be good for the younger generation\r\n\r\nto have their old folks live with them so that the\r\n\r\nparents   can  help  look  after  the   children's\r\n\r\nchildren,  and  towards this end we  are  offering\r\n\r\nincentives.  Yet,  on  the  other  hand,  we   are\r\n\r\nenticing  the old folks to stay on in  their  jobs\r\n\r\nbeyond  60  years  of  age. Basically,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nagainst  extending retirement age well  beyond  55\r\n\r\nyears of age which, I think, is a good move, but I\r\n\r\nam  somewhat puzzled by the apparent contradiction\r\n\r\nin our policies. I also find it difficult to agree\r\n\r\nwith  the  Minister's  statement  that  all  items\r\n\r\naffected  by higher taxes are \"not basic  to  life\r\n\r\nfor the average family\". What is our definition of\r\n\r\nan   average  family?  Take  the  item,  cars  for\r\n\r\nexample.  In our efforts to discourage  ownership,\r\n\r\nit appears to me that we do wield the big stick of\r\n\r\ntaxation   rather   too  often,   too   soon   and\r\n\r\nindiscriminately,  without  carefully  considering\r\n\r\nand  offering  the carrot of suitable alternative.\r\n\r\nThe  livelihood of many families depends on  their\r\n\r\nability  to  get  around quickly  but  our  public\r\n\r\ntransport system at best is still\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninadequate to satisfy this need. It is, therefore,\r\n\r\nin  my opinion unfair to raise road tax further at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture, particularly on the less expensive\r\n\r\nsmall capacity cars which are more functional than\r\n\r\nprestigious.  The cubic capacity of a  car  should\r\n\r\nnot  be the sole criterion in determining the rate\r\n\r\nof  road tax payable. If our intention is also  to\r\n\r\ntax  more heavily on those who are better able  to\r\n\r\npay,  then, it is only logical that we should also\r\n\r\nhave regard to the value of a car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxing more heavily on hard liquors, such as\r\n\r\nwhisky  and brandy, is fair enough as quite  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  their harmful effect on health they are also\r\n\r\nentirely  imported. The same cannot  be  said  for\r\n\r\nbeer.  This is fast gaining popularity even  among\r\n\r\nour working class, it is wrong to deprive them  of\r\n\r\none of the very few legitimate poor pleasures left\r\n\r\nin  life, which is comparatively inexpensive up to\r\n\r\nnow.  The proposed increases are therefore  to  my\r\n\r\nmind  rather  harsh and will put this item  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  means of many. Perhaps the Minister does  not\r\n\r\nenjoy beer!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally Sir, it is reassuring to note the\r\n\r\nMinister's  reluctance  to increase  taxation,  to\r\n\r\nquote  his words \"Lest it should raise the  prices\r\n\r\nof  essential goods and services\". I do hope  that\r\n\r\nthis  wisdom on his part will be shared and  borne\r\n\r\nin  mind by all his Cabinet colleagues as well  as\r\n\r\nour  civil  servants in the months ahead  so  that\r\n\r\nhopefully we can look forward to a really painless\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Minister for Finance  has  made\r\n\r\nhis  Budget statement in this House on the 3rd  of\r\n\r\nthis  month.  Although this  Budget  is  not  like\r\n\r\nprevious  budgets  which  could  he  described  as\r\n\r\npainless,  it  is  still not a  budget  that  will\r\n\r\nincrease  the burden of the people.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nmeet  our  stop-gap  needs  in  development,   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has announced an increase  of\r\n\r\ntaxes only on liquor, tobacco and cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe  has also announced certain tax relief measures\r\n\r\nfor  employees who continue to work after reaching\r\n\r\n55  or  60  years  of age. For them  their  earned\r\n\r\nincome  relief  will be increased  from  $1000  to\r\n\r\n$2000 for those over 55 years old and to $3000 for\r\n\r\nthose  over  60  years old. These relief  measures\r\n\r\nwill  reduce  our  revenue by $4 million.  Setting\r\n\r\nadditional revenue against additional reliefs,  we\r\n\r\nwill  still be left with some residue. This  shows\r\n\r\nthat our new financial policy is one that aims  to\r\n\r\nreduce  economic recession and to  promote  future\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  so  that our economy  will  be  more\r\n\r\nstable  and  sound.  This is what  we  all  should\r\n\r\nsupport wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, on the question of income tax I\r\n\r\nhave  some  criticisms as well as  suggestions  to\r\n\r\nmake here, Regarding earned income tax relief  for\r\n\r\nthose  who are over 55 years old, this measure  is\r\n\r\nnot  to  be  criticised unfavourably. However,  it\r\n\r\nseems that the Finance Minister has neglected  the\r\n\r\nfact that while the aged employees need more money\r\n\r\nto   keep  themselves  healthy,  he  should   also\r\n\r\nremember  that the younger wage-earners need  even\r\n\r\nmore  money  for maintenance of their  health  and\r\n\r\nhouse-keeping. The aged employees normally already\r\n\r\nhave  grown up children, some of whom are  working\r\n\r\nand  can  afford  to help the family  financially.\r\n\r\nHowever,   with  the  younger  employees   it   is\r\n\r\ndifferent.  They  have  children  in  primary   or\r\n\r\nsecondary schools or even in the universities.  So\r\n\r\nexpenditure in this respect is a very great burden\r\n\r\nto  the younger parents generally. Although  there\r\n\r\nis  a tax relief of $750 for the first child, with\r\n\r\nthe  present  cost of living this  relief  is  not\r\n\r\nenough  even to feed the child for one year,  much\r\n\r\nless   the   amount  necessary  for  the   child's\r\n\r\neducation.  Moreover, the aged  employees  usually\r\n\r\nget higher salaries through annual increments over\r\n\r\nthe  years  as compared with the younger employees\r\n\r\nwho  are  lower paid. So I hope that the  salaried\r\n\r\nclass  should  have  their  tax  relief  increased\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the Income Tax Act, I 947, the\r\n\r\npersonal relief for the taxpayer was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$3,000  and  $2,000  for his wife.  But  with  the\r\n\r\namendment  in 1961 the taxpayer's personal  relief\r\n\r\nwas  reduced  to $2,000 but he was also  given  an\r\n\r\nearned  income relief of 20% up to  a  maximum  of\r\n\r\n$1,000.  Tax relief for the wife was also  reduced\r\n\r\nto  $1,000. So the total amount of tax relief  for\r\n\r\nboth husband and wife had been reduced by at least\r\n\r\n$1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a great difference in the standard\r\n\r\nof  living  some  years ago as compared  with  the\r\n\r\npresent,  when we are faced with inflation  and  a\r\n\r\nrising  cost  of  living.  As  we  all  know,  the\r\n\r\nordinary  people generally find it very  difficult\r\n\r\nto  earn a living. Therefore, it is reasonable  to\r\n\r\nassume  that  there  is a pressing  need  to  make\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  the  income  tax  policy  and  to\r\n\r\nincrease personal tax reliefs in particular.  Sir,\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  in  the  salaried class  are  the  most\r\n\r\nhonest in the submission of tax returns. They  pay\r\n\r\ntheir  taxes without trying to evade tax, as there\r\n\r\nis   no   additional  income.  In  the   case   of\r\n\r\nbusinessmen,  however, we know that some  of  them\r\n\r\nare not honest. They expose themselves to the risk\r\n\r\nof  being investigated into or fined. They  always\r\n\r\ntry some means to evade tax or to reduce their tax\r\n\r\ndues.  This is an open secret. Therefore,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to express my hope that the Government\r\n\r\nwould step up the tax investigations and curb  tax\r\n\r\nevasion  activities in order to plug the loopholes\r\n\r\nand increase our tax revenue. The present taxation\r\n\r\npolicy  should not just aim at increasing revenue.\r\n\r\nIt should be a means to reduce the gap between the\r\n\r\nrich  and the poor. So I would like to suggest  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government that the tax rate of 50%  for  the\r\n\r\nrich  people who have an income of half a  million\r\n\r\ndollars or more a year should be increased to 60%.\r\n\r\nThe Government should also consider increasing the\r\n\r\ntax  levied on companies from 40% to 50%. Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthe   Government  can  consider  and   accept   my\r\n\r\nsuggestions,  then  our  financial  revenue   will\r\n\r\nsurely  not  be  in any difficulty.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nsincerely  hope  that  our Minister  for  Finance,\r\n\r\nafter  cool, calm and careful consideration,  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to find that there is a pressing need  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the rate of personal tax relief  in  the\r\n\r\nnear future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  under the double impact  of  world\r\n\r\neconomic  recession  and  inflation,  our   actual\r\n\r\neconomic growth last year had achieved the rate of\r\n\r\n6.8%.  It was really a rare and commendable  feat.\r\n\r\nIt  was  due to the unity of our people and  their\r\n\r\neffort  in  production. We have a good  Government\r\n\r\nadministration  and our society has  been  stable.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the basic prerequisites  for  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment. When there is economic growth, we  do\r\n\r\nnot have to spend our foreign reserves to meet our\r\n\r\nincreasing  expenditure. This is very  commendable\r\n\r\nand  something to be congratulated for. As for the\r\n\r\ncoming financial year, other than the increase  in\r\n\r\ntax for those who drive, drink or smoke, there are\r\n\r\nno   other   important  or  unfavourable  taxation\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  affect the daily livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\nordinary people to any appreciable extent. Besides\r\n\r\nthis,  the Minister for Finance has also  proposed\r\n\r\nseveral   measures  to  stimulate   our   economic\r\n\r\nactivities to ensure that our economic growth will\r\n\r\nrecover as quickly as possible. Therefore, it is a\r\n\r\nBudget that is to be welcomed by all the people in\r\n\r\nall walks of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I regret to say is that in his Budget\r\n\r\nspeech,  as in the past, he has again omitted  any\r\n\r\nmention  of our agricultural development  and  its\r\n\r\nrelated  matters.  This shows  that  in  spite  of\r\n\r\nseveral   surveys   conducted   by   the   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department on the agricultural  sector,\r\n\r\nthe  Government still does not have any  clear-cut\r\n\r\npolicy  in  respect  of agricultural  development.\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics, in our country there  are\r\n\r\nnearly   20,000  people  engaged  in  agricultural\r\n\r\nactivities.  To  add  it  up  to  people  who  are\r\n\r\ndirectly or indirectly connected with agricultural\r\n\r\nactivities,  the  total number is  not  less  than\r\n\r\n200,000.In  other words, about 10%  of  our  total\r\n\r\npopulation  are  dependent on  agriculture  for  a\r\n\r\nliving.  All  along, our agricultural  sector  has\r\n\r\nbeen  left alone to sink or swim by itself.  Under\r\n\r\nthe   pre-requisites  of  industrialisation,   the\r\n\r\nagricultural  sector  has  to  give  way  and  the\r\n\r\nfarmers have to make sacrifices for the sake of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   future  of  our  country.  They  have   made\r\n\r\nsacrifices  and  incurred certain  inconveniences.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not justifiable to call on only one\r\n\r\nsection of the population to make great sacrifices\r\n\r\nfor the development of the country. However, those\r\n\r\nfarmers  who  are  affected  should  at  least  be\r\n\r\ngranted  reasonable compensation to match  current\r\n\r\nprices.  Otherwise,  the  meager  sum  of  a   few\r\n\r\nthousands  of  dollars as compensation  would  not\r\n\r\nhelp   them   rebuild   their   household   in   a\r\n\r\nresettlement.  So  the authority concerned  should\r\n\r\nadjust its resettlement compensation rates now and\r\n\r\nthen, just as the Public Utilities Board has  been\r\n\r\nreadjusting its rates on consumption now and then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is a small country with a small population.\r\n\r\nTherefore,   the   domestic   market    for    our\r\n\r\nagricultural products is limited. In  addition  to\r\n\r\nthis,  the agricultural sector has not been  given\r\n\r\nany   proper  planning.  Therefore,  whether   the\r\n\r\nharvest  is rich or poor, the farmers do  not  get\r\n\r\nmuch in the end. Whenever there is a rich harvest,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  glut in the market  and  prices  are\r\n\r\nreduced; and so the farmers have to sell at  lower\r\n\r\nprices to avoid incurring greater losses. If there\r\n\r\nis  a poor harvest, then the supply is reduced and\r\n\r\nprices  increase.  However, although  the  farmers\r\n\r\nwould  hate  to produce less, their production  is\r\n\r\nlimited   and  therefore  their  profit  is   also\r\n\r\nlimited.  Then  there is also the exploitation  by\r\n\r\nthe  middleman.  In fact, with the  middleman  the\r\n\r\nincome  of  the  farmers is reduced  even  further\r\n\r\nbecause the difference between the wholesale price\r\n\r\nand the retail price is usually four or five-fold.\r\n\r\nA  clear  example  is when the price  of  eggs  is\r\n\r\nreduced,  consumers still pay the  same  price  as\r\n\r\nbefore. Agricultural produce cannot be sent direct\r\n\r\nto  the  consumers. This is a shortcoming  in  the\r\n\r\ntrade cycle. Trading without going through a third\r\n\r\nparty  is beneficial both to the producer and  the\r\n\r\nconsumer. Sir, the Finance Ministry has done  well\r\n\r\nin  curbing inflation and I hope it can  also  pay\r\n\r\nmore  attention  to  this matter  of  facilitating\r\n\r\ndirect trade in agricultural produce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land is a necessary factor of production of\r\n\r\nthe  farmer. Most farmers lack sufficient land for\r\n\r\ncultivation. Therefore, many of them are occupying\r\n\r\nland  on  Temporary Occupation Licences  from  the\r\n\r\nLand  Office.  Only a few farmers have  their  own\r\n\r\nprivate land. The TOLs do not stipulate the number\r\n\r\nof  years that the land can be occupied and  since\r\n\r\nthe  rental  is uncertain, whenever  the  land  is\r\n\r\nacquired by Government, the farmers have  to  move\r\n\r\nout.  Therefore  they dare not  put  in  too  much\r\n\r\ncapital  to  develop their land. Although  genuine\r\n\r\nfarmers  may be allotted alternative  land  it  is\r\n\r\nusually  much  less than before. I feel  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should give genuine farmers  some  form\r\n\r\nof  land  title  for a definite number  of  years,\r\n\r\ninstead of TOLs in order to enable them to realize\r\n\r\nthe  concept of the tillers owning their own land.\r\n\r\nIn  this way they will safeguard their land.  This\r\n\r\nwill  strengthen  their love for their  homes  and\r\n\r\ntheir  land,  and  they  will  strive  harder   to\r\n\r\nincrease production and further development.  This\r\n\r\nin  any way is to the good of our national economy\r\n\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although land is limited -- there is not\r\n\r\nmuch  for  agriculture  - we  can  still  allot  a\r\n\r\ncertain part of land for agricultural purposes. In\r\n\r\nthe     course     of    our    development     in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, urbanisation and in the pursuit\r\n\r\nof   antipollution  measures,   arable   land   is\r\n\r\nconstantly being reduced. To make the agricultural\r\n\r\nsector  viable  and to ensure  a  profit  for  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  so  that  they can carry  on  with  their\r\n\r\nactivities,  then new techniques and  new  farming\r\n\r\nimplements must be adopted, and farming should  he\r\n\r\nintensified.  There should also be  anti-pollution\r\n\r\nfacilities. This involves a large capital  and  it\r\n\r\nis   not  what  the  farmers  can  bear  or   help\r\n\r\nthemselves.  So  I  feel  that  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nFinance,  in the same spirit that has  been  given\r\n\r\nfor  industrial  development, should  provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  and convenient means of  loans  at  low\r\n\r\ninterest   to   the   farmers   for   agricultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment  which  has  a  long  history  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  The Ministry of Finance can  assess  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the farmers from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  survey  and  recommendation  of  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department and give the  farmers  some\r\n\r\neconomic help. At the moment the farmers have been\r\n\r\nobtaining their loans through tontines, middlemen,\r\n\r\nor  credit  accounts with the feedstuff merchants.\r\n\r\nThe   farmers   repay   their   debts   by   their\r\n\r\nagricultural produce. Very often the middlemen and\r\n\r\nfeedstuff merchants use the produce of the farmers\r\n\r\nto  set off their credit accounts. The prices  are\r\n\r\ntherefore usually determined by the creditors  and\r\n\r\nthe profit of the farmers, as we can see, will  be\r\n\r\neven  lower. If the prices of agricultural produce\r\n\r\nare  low, the diligent and frugal efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  are  all \"gone with the wind\".  Sometimes\r\n\r\neven  their \"sweat capital\" is entirely  lost.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  recover, the farmers have to  get  some\r\n\r\ncapital. If some financial assistance can be given\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry of Finance to help them  recover\r\n\r\nquickly,  it  will  help develop  agriculture  and\r\n\r\nimprove the livelihood of the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Addendum to the Presidential Address\r\n\r\nin  this  House  sometime ago, it is  stated  that\r\n\r\n\"Singapore  continues  to  be  self-sufficient  in\r\n\r\nfresh  pork, eggs and poultry\". This is a  correct\r\n\r\nobjective.  The authorities concerned should  give\r\n\r\npriority  to  the question of giving the  producer\r\n\r\nreasonable profit and the consumer a fair price in\r\n\r\norder  to  achieve this objective. At  the  moment\r\n\r\nthousands  of  pig  farmers  are  faced  with   an\r\n\r\nimportant question: whether to keep the number  of\r\n\r\npigs  within  100 heads, or to exceed that  number\r\n\r\nand  face  resettlement  for  the  sake  of  anti-pollution measures. This is something that affects\r\n\r\nthe  farmers  greatly. Some of them  have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  resettled more than once before, and because\r\n\r\nthey  are not certain of their future and  of  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  compensation for resettlement  clean-cut\r\n\r\nanswers are required to help them decide. In order\r\n\r\nto  be self-sufficient in water supply, there will\r\n\r\nbe stringent anti-pollution measures in the catch-meat  areas. Of course, nobody can find fault with\r\n\r\nthis objective. As citizens, the farmers will also\r\n\r\ngive   their   fullest   support.   However,    as\r\n\r\nconstituents of the population of our country, the\r\n\r\nfarmers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  entitled  to  a basic livelihood,  and  their\r\n\r\nbasic  means  of  livelihood should  also  not  be\r\n\r\nneglected. The younger generation may find it  not\r\n\r\ntoo  much of a problem to change their career, but\r\n\r\nwith  these  aged farmers it is very difficult  to\r\n\r\nget alternative employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been self-sufficient in the supply\r\n\r\nof  pork,  chicken and eggs, and  the  prices  are\r\n\r\nquite  reasonable.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the\r\n\r\ncontribution of the big and small time farmers. If\r\n\r\nall  the small time farmers are eliminated in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of national development leaving  only  the\r\n\r\nbig time farmers to continue, this will result  in\r\n\r\na  scarcity of supplies and prices will be  easily\r\n\r\nmanipulated by the few big time farmers,  This  is\r\n\r\nwhat  the consumers do not like to happen. I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  authorities concerned should  pay  more\r\n\r\nattention  and care for the small time farmers  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them to develop. The authorities should  not\r\n\r\njust pay attention to the big time farmers alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to sum up, our agricultural sector is on the\r\n\r\ndecline with ever greater speed, and this  is  the\r\n\r\ntime to save the declining agricultural sector.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that the Minister for Finance can spend some\r\n\r\ntime to seriously look into the question of how to\r\n\r\npromote  our  agricultural industry  so  that  our\r\n\r\npeople  can  be fortunate in the supply  of  food,\r\n\r\nwhich is something good for our country too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am happy to join my colleagues\r\n\r\nin  paying tribute to the Finance Minister  for  a\r\n\r\nvery  circumspect Budget statement.  The  Economic\r\n\r\nSurvey of Singapore, 1974, earlier distributed  by\r\n\r\nhim  was  a commendable effort by his Ministry  to\r\n\r\nfurnish us with updated statistical information on\r\n\r\nour overall economic activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at our economic situation against\r\n\r\nthe  backdrop  of a world economy,  stricken  with\r\n\r\nparalvsing stagflation, to which we are invariably\r\n\r\nvulnerable, we realise only too well that  it  was\r\n\r\nan  uphill  task  for a non-oil producing  country\r\n\r\nlike Singapore to come out unscathed. The economic\r\n\r\nproblem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfaced by the world has shifted in our favour as  a\r\n\r\nresult of a number of factors attributable to  our\r\n\r\ncorrect  analysis  of  the problem  -  intelligent\r\n\r\nanticipation and the alternative measures  adopted\r\n\r\nto overcome the difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is gratifying to be told that we have in 1974\r\n\r\nachieved  a  growth  rate  of  6.8%.  During   the\r\n\r\ncorresponding period some of the richest and  most\r\n\r\nprogressive countries in the world have registered\r\n\r\nnil  economic  growth. Our economic  strategy  has\r\n\r\npaid   us   dividends.  Diversification   of   our\r\n\r\nindustrial activities resulting in an even  spread\r\n\r\nof  our earnings without having to depend too much\r\n\r\non  any  one  particular manufacturing  group  has\r\n\r\nhelped us to pull through the crucial period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When certain sectors such as electronics,\r\n\r\ntextiles/garments and wood-based industries took a\r\n\r\nbeating,  resulting  in about  20,000  jobs  being\r\n\r\ndeclared  redundant, wholesale  and  retail  trade\r\n\r\nincluding  restaurants and hotels  contributed  to\r\n\r\n49%  of our 6.8% growth. We are told that the  GDP\r\n\r\nat  current  factor cost in 1974 was estimated  at\r\n\r\n$12,145 million, an increase of $2,524 million  or\r\n\r\n26.2%, over that of 1973. Very remarkable indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport, storage and communication sector\r\n\r\nprovided  14%  of  our overall  growth.  Next  was\r\n\r\nfinance,   insurance,  real  estate  and  business\r\n\r\nservices  sector  9%.  The  same  9%  growth   was\r\n\r\nrecorded   by   community,  social  and   personal\r\n\r\nservices sector. Manufacturing 7%; construction 5%\r\n\r\nand ownership of dwellings 5%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this overall picture of our real growth\r\n\r\nin  1974, we were also informed of the widening of\r\n\r\nthe   base   of   our  manufacturing   sector   by\r\n\r\nintroducing new skills and products in  metal  and\r\n\r\nprecision engineering, chemicals, e1ectronics  and\r\n\r\ntransport  equipment. This  has  resulted  in  the\r\n\r\nadvent  of  new  industries to  augment  our  main\r\n\r\nmanufacturing activities, such as shipbuilding and\r\n\r\nship-repairing  (14.8%  of  total  value   added),\r\n\r\nrefining   of  petroleum  (20.3%)  and  electrical\r\n\r\nmachinery (21.6%). No\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsingle industrial group accounts for more than 22%\r\n\r\nof  our  total earnings. In other words,  we  were\r\n\r\nprudent  enough  to  put  our  eggs  in  different\r\n\r\nbaskets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to note that the major elements\r\n\r\nof  our  economic policy would be  guided  by  our\r\n\r\nobjective   of   maintaining  high  growth   rate,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding  the present recession,  and  that\r\n\r\nindustrialization would continue to accentuate our\r\n\r\ngrowth.  Singapore  will  continue  to  serve  the\r\n\r\nregion  as  a services centre for technical  know-how, tourism and finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While taking all necessary measures to counter\r\n\r\nand  minimise the effects of recession,  we  would\r\n\r\nalso  put the present slack period to full use  by\r\n\r\ngiving  priority  to the training  of  workers  to\r\n\r\nraise the level of skills to meet the needs of the\r\n\r\nresurgent   generation  of   skill-intensive   and\r\n\r\ntechnology-oriented enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Capital Assistance Scheme to assist skill\r\n\r\nintensive  industries, the reorganisation  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board to make greater efforts\r\n\r\nto  promote  investments and the establishment  of\r\n\r\ntwo   more   promotion  centres  in  Houston   and\r\n\r\nCopenhagen  in  addition to the  nine  centres  in\r\n\r\nexistence,  tax incentives for pioneer industries,\r\n\r\njoint  venture projects, strengthening  of  export\r\n\r\npromotion   efforts  and  the   stepping   up   of\r\n\r\nconstruction  activity  by increasing  the  Public\r\n\r\nSector  Development expenditure to $3,080 million,\r\n\r\nthe manpower development policy to increase skills\r\n\r\nin  our  work  force  by  expanding  training  and\r\n\r\nretraining programmes undertaken by the Industrial\r\n\r\nTraining   Board  and  Joint  Industrial  Training\r\n\r\nCentres  all  these are steps taken in  the  right\r\n\r\ndirection,  which in perspective deserve  adequate\r\n\r\nrecognition and approbation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the standards of technological skills\r\n\r\nimprove  and when our workers exert themselves  to\r\n\r\nachieve  better  results, better wage  rates  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  paid by industries. As  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister   has  stated,  \"Productivity   increases\r\n\r\ndepend  as  much  on  workers  as  on  employers.\"\r\n\r\nMention must he made at this juncture that  it  is\r\n\r\nstill the practice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  some employers to flog the horse with outdated\r\n\r\nmachinery, bad supervision, old methods of working\r\n\r\nand  colonial  type of personnel  managements  who\r\n\r\ndeprecate   the  workers  joining  unions.   These\r\n\r\nmanagements enjoy a field day in hiring and firing\r\n\r\nworkers  at  the  slightest whims and  fancies  of\r\n\r\nofficialdom. Only recently the Labour Minister had\r\n\r\nto order the reinstatement of five salesmen sacked\r\n\r\nby  a  firm,  by  the blessing  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nEmployers Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on the subject of unions, let me touch on\r\n\r\nanother subject which is very pertinent in view of\r\n\r\nthe  predicament in which we find ourselves today.\r\n\r\nIn  the absence of any definite indication  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  period by which the sick economy of the world\r\n\r\nwill  recover, the inflationary trend that we have\r\n\r\nbeen  experiencing in the past  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nhurt us, especially the wage earners. Although the\r\n\r\nNational  Wages Council prevents the  wage  claims\r\n\r\nsituation   from  going  haywire  by  its   annual\r\n\r\nstocktaking  of  the overall economic  performance\r\n\r\nbefore giving its recommendations, for the sake of\r\n\r\ncollective  agreements, a process  which  goes  on\r\n\r\ncontinuously  upon the lapse of old agreements,  I\r\n\r\nshould  have  thought the Finance  Minister  could\r\n\r\nhave  given the Government's guidelines  of  wages\r\n\r\npolicy  to  be  pursued  by  the  managements  and\r\n\r\nunions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the more unpalatable part of the\r\n\r\nbudget, let me take a look at the taxation policy.\r\n\r\nOf  course  it  is  the primary  function  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  give priority to  economic  growth\r\n\r\nwhich  would  in turn bring increased  revenue  to\r\n\r\nfinance  public expenditure. This needs money  and\r\n\r\nthe public has to pay for it in the form of taxes,\r\n\r\neither directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to upset the apple cart of prices of\r\n\r\nessential  goods and services, there  will  be  no\r\n\r\nincreases  to  existing  taxes,  which  is  to  be\r\n\r\nappreciated.  Additional revenue, therefore,  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  come  from increased taxes  on  tobacco,\r\n\r\nliquor  and cars. The reason is that to quote  the\r\n\r\nMinister these are \"not basic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  life  for the average family\". In the case  of\r\n\r\ntobacco  and  liquor, I have no quarrel  with  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  He who smokes pays. Measures introduced\r\n\r\nby  the Government to discourage smoking over  the\r\n\r\nlast few years have been quite successful. If  the\r\n\r\nadditional tax would further reduce the number  of\r\n\r\nsmokers, it is all for the good. The same goes for\r\n\r\nliquor. Those who want to drink will have to pay a\r\n\r\nlittle more. Fair enough. But I cannot see eye  to\r\n\r\neye  with the Minister on his contention that cars\r\n\r\nare \"not basic to life for the average family\". In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  have  reached a stage of sophistication\r\n\r\nthat  a  motor  car has become a necessity  rather\r\n\r\nthan  a  luxury  for a very large number  of  wage\r\n\r\nearners,  professional people and businessmen.  We\r\n\r\nhave to take cognizance of the fact that we do not\r\n\r\nyet  have an efficient transport service which can\r\n\r\ntake  a busy man to his destination as quickly  as\r\n\r\nhe  wants.  Let  me  hasten  to  add  that  public\r\n\r\ntransport has improved compared to this time  last\r\n\r\nyear. Our efforts to reorganise the Singapore  Bus\r\n\r\nService  and  to bring some order into  its  inept\r\n\r\nmanagement   have  not  completely  produced   the\r\n\r\ndesired results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the large crowds of commuters at bus\r\n\r\nstops have thinned down, the situation is far from\r\n\r\ncompletely  satisfactory.  This  means  that  many\r\n\r\npeople have to depend on the family motor car  for\r\n\r\nquick  transportation from place to place in their\r\n\r\neveryday  working  life.  This  is  additional  to\r\n\r\ntaking  their children to and from school. On  the\r\n\r\none  hand  the Government wants our people  to  be\r\n\r\nhardworking,  innovative and  forceful  in  taking\r\n\r\ninitiatives to make Singapore tick as a centre  of\r\n\r\nmanifold  activities in this region. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand our energetic people are rendered immobile by\r\n\r\nGovernment action, such as higher road taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming in the wake of quadrupling of oil prices\r\n\r\nand the resultant inflationary spiral in prices of\r\n\r\nessential  commodities  from  which  many  of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  have not fully recovered, this  hike  in\r\n\r\nhigher  road tax will deliver the knock-out  punch\r\n\r\non the middle income\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroup.  Owners of cars in the 1000 cc to  1600  cc\r\n\r\nclass  fall  within the heaviest taxed group,  and\r\n\r\nthey are the middle income people who have to take\r\n\r\nthe main brunt on their shoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If higher taxes is the means to curb vehicular\r\n\r\ntraffic, here again there is a dangerous loophole.\r\n\r\nThe  rich people who own 2000 cc and 3000 cc  cars\r\n\r\nand  those  with  large families owning  only  one\r\n\r\nlarge car for the whole family would now prefer to\r\n\r\nown  two  small cars instead of one  large,  cheap\r\n\r\nwhite  elephant. This means two cars on  the  road\r\n\r\ninstead of one. Who wins? The rich man can  afford\r\n\r\nto  pay  the  hike and he will take  this  in  his\r\n\r\nstride.  What about the not-so-rich man  who  owns\r\n\r\none family car?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chasing the motorists and penalising them is not\r\n\r\nthe  enlightened way of finding a solution to  our\r\n\r\ntraffic problems. While the vehicular traffic  has\r\n\r\nincreased,   our  roads  have  not  been   widened\r\n\r\ncommensurately.  We have not introduced  the  mass\r\n\r\nrapid  transit system to cater for  the  needs  of\r\n\r\nincreasing numbers of commuters. As long  as  this\r\n\r\nproblem  remains  unsolved,  it  would  serve   no\r\n\r\npurpose whatsoever to put an increasing burden  on\r\n\r\ncar  owners,  most of whom are industrious  people\r\n\r\nstruggling diligently to increase our economy  and\r\n\r\nimprove  the  quality of our people. We  are  only\r\n\r\napplying  a  brake  on  our economic  progress  by\r\n\r\nputting obstacles in their path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister's announcement of a tax\r\n\r\nconcession  for people over 50 and  60  years  old\r\n\r\nfrom  1976  at  a cost of some $4 million  adds  a\r\n\r\nmerciful  touch to his Budget. Singapore can  well\r\n\r\nafford this concession. By the same token, for the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the lower and middle income groups  of\r\n\r\nwage earners, on whom the burden of inflation  has\r\n\r\nfallen very heavily, there is a strong case for  a\r\n\r\nconcession in earned income relief to be increased\r\n\r\nfrom  the  present  $1,000 to $2,000.  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nconclude   my  speech  on  this  happy   note   of\r\n\r\nanticipation, and I thank the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that  I  am voicing the concern  of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  public in making reference today  to  the\r\n\r\nstartling  increase in the existing  road  tax,  a\r\n\r\nmeasure   which   is   being   introduced   almost\r\n\r\nsimultaneously  with the restrictions  on  traffic\r\n\r\nentering  the Central Business District. It  would\r\n\r\nappear that the large increase in road tax is  not\r\n\r\nmeant  to  raise revenue or meet part of recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure. If it was just a matter of increasing\r\n\r\nrevenue,  then surely there are other areas  which\r\n\r\ncould   yield   revenue  without   causing   undue\r\n\r\nhardship. Its main objective would seem to be  the\r\n\r\ndrastic  reduction of the number of  cars  on  the\r\n\r\nroad.  This  being the case, I would suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  massive  increase  in  road  tax  is  both  a\r\n\r\nnegative approach and inequitable: it will,  among\r\n\r\nother things, only serve to increase the burden of\r\n\r\nthe middle and lower income groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be noted that the largest increase is for\r\n\r\nmotor  cars between 1000 cc and 2000 cc.  Cars  in\r\n\r\nthis  range are generally owned by the middle  and\r\n\r\nlower income groups who, in the past, used to  pay\r\n\r\napproximately 17 cents per cc. But  now  with  the\r\n\r\nincreased road tax, they have to pay 25 cents  per\r\n\r\ncc this is almost 50% more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must repeat my contention that\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in  road tax constitutes  a  wholly\r\n\r\nnegative approach because our Government,  founded\r\n\r\non  the  principles of socialism, is dedicated  to\r\n\r\nraising  the living standards of the lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup. From the time we came to power we have been\r\n\r\nconcentrating on introducing measure after measure\r\n\r\nto  narrow the gap between the \"haves\" and  \"have-nots\".   I   submit  that  the  growing  affluence\r\n\r\nengendered  by this process of social equalisation\r\n\r\nhas   made   the   motor  car,  as   a   form   of\r\n\r\ntransportation, more of a necessity than a luxury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Mr Speaker, Sir, a measure is being\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  penalise those who,  through  hard\r\n\r\nwork and diligence, have increased their income to\r\n\r\nthe point where they are able to afford a car of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir own. If the Government's objective is merely\r\n\r\nto  reduce the number of new cars on the roads, it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  too  difficult  to  arrive  at   a\r\n\r\nsolution.  For  example, the Ministry  of  Finance\r\n\r\ncould  increase the import duty so  that  existing\r\n\r\ncar  owners  will not be unfairly penalised  -  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  potential car owners  who  have  to\r\n\r\ndecide  on  the  possible alternatives.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  if  they decide to have a motor car,  they\r\n\r\nwill  have  to sacrifice something else.  In  this\r\n\r\nway, the choice will be left to them -a motor  car\r\n\r\nat  the expense of some other luxury or necessity.\r\n\r\nThe point of this approach is that the choice will\r\n\r\nquite  fairly  be left to the individual.  No  man\r\n\r\nneed  thus  be penalised for events  of  the  past\r\n\r\nwhich  have created a situation over which he  has\r\n\r\nno control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another way to reduce effectively\r\n\r\nthe number of new cars -by requiring all those who\r\n\r\nwish  to  purchase new cars to apply for  permits.\r\n\r\nThis   is   a   procedure  that  is  being   quite\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  adopted in several other  countries.\r\n\r\nThis  approach  will  also  be  more  satisfactory\r\n\r\nbecause  it  should  be fairly easy  to  ascertain\r\n\r\nwhether   an  applicant  for  a  new  car   merits\r\n\r\nconsideration  by the simple method  of  obtaining\r\n\r\nclearance  from the Comptroller of Income  Tax  to\r\n\r\ndetermine whether or not he is paying income  tax.\r\n\r\nIf he is not, how then can he afford a new car? It\r\n\r\nwould  certainly  prove a more  equitable  way  of\r\n\r\nreducing the number of cars on the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present increase in road tax will not\r\n\r\neffectively reduce the number of cars on the  road\r\n\r\nas  envisaged by the Government. This  is  because\r\n\r\nowners of cars have, by this gross increase in car\r\n\r\ntax,  either to pay the increased tax  and  retain\r\n\r\nthe  car or sell the car to some other person  who\r\n\r\ncan afford the tax. We will therefore have exactly\r\n\r\nthe  same  number of cars on the road!  This  will\r\n\r\nclearly defeat the Government's objective. In this\r\n\r\ncontext, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me refer to the park\r\n\r\nand  ride scheme and the Central Business District\r\n\r\nentry restrictions. Should we not wait to see  the\r\n\r\neffect  of  the  new  travel  restrictions  before\r\n\r\nimposing taxes on motor cars?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  seems  to  me  that this two-prong  attack  on\r\n\r\nmotorists   is  tantamount  to  anticipating   the\r\n\r\nfailure of the Central Business District scheme. I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest therefore that the car tax increase\r\n\r\nbe deferred until the Government is able to assess\r\n\r\nthe  effect  of  the  park and  ride  and  Central\r\n\r\nBusiness  District schemes. Only  if  these  prove\r\n\r\nunsuccessful in restricting the number of cars  in\r\n\r\nthe   Central  Business  District   to   a   level\r\n\r\nconsidered  desirable  by the  Government,  should\r\n\r\nother measures be considered. May I add also  that\r\n\r\nthe  present scheme seems calculated to drive cars\r\n\r\noff  the  road  even in areas where  there  is  no\r\n\r\ntraffic problem at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would urge the Government to\r\n\r\nseriously   reconsider  this  car  tax   increase,\r\n\r\nespecially because there is no adequate  transport\r\n\r\nfor  commuters as yet. Our bus services are  still\r\n\r\ninadequate  for  they are clearly unable  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  demand.  Until  the  bus  services  are\r\n\r\nconsiderably  improved and able to meet  with  the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of the public, there  should  be  no\r\n\r\nfurther  increase  in car tax. Otherwise  we  will\r\n\r\nonly  be  crippling the members of the public  who\r\n\r\nown  motor cars without being able to provide them\r\n\r\nwith  a  reasonable alternative method of  getting\r\n\r\naround and coping with the problems of living  and\r\n\r\nworking in a busy, populated city such as ours is.\r\n\r\nThe point really is: have we the right to increase\r\n\r\nthe burden on the shoulders of the average working\r\n\r\nclass  Singaporean? His car may seem a  symbol  of\r\n\r\nundue  affluence but it could in reality be merely\r\n\r\nhis most prized and dearly bought possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I strongly urge that this\r\n\r\nincrease in road tax be seriously reconsidered, in\r\n\r\nthe context of what I have noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now turn to the income tax\r\n\r\nconcession granted by the Finance Minister for old\r\n\r\npeople  capable of working beyond  55  years,  the\r\n\r\nformer  retiring age, or even 60, the new retiring\r\n\r\nage.  It is observed that this concession has been\r\n\r\nmade because of our rapid economic development  in\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlast few years, which has highlighted the need for\r\n\r\nour  skilled  and  experienced  people  to  go  on\r\n\r\nworking beyond the normal retirement age.  It  has\r\n\r\napparently  been recognised that such people  will\r\n\r\nneed  to  spend  more  money staying  healthy  and\r\n\r\ngetting to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed a step in the right direction and\r\n\r\nis  a  most  welcome concession. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest,  however, that the care and concern  made\r\n\r\nevident  in this gesture be extended also  to  the\r\n\r\nyounger, struggling members of our nation. We know\r\n\r\nthat  the  consumer price index has risen  sharply\r\n\r\nrecently, but income tax relief in general remains\r\n\r\npegged  to the rate fixed more than 20 years  ago.\r\n\r\nIt  is high time a thorough re-assessment was made\r\n\r\nand more tax relief accorded to lighten the burden\r\n\r\nof the beleaguered working classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the indulgence of the\r\n\r\nHouse, I would like to refer to my representations\r\n\r\nto   the  House  in  March  last  year,  when  the\r\n\r\nHonourable  Minister  for  Finance  presented  his\r\n\r\nprevious  budget. I pointed out that the  personal\r\n\r\nrelief on income was fixed more than 20 years  ago\r\n\r\nand  called  for this to be increased  to  a  more\r\n\r\nrealistic  and  pragmatic level, in  keeping  with\r\n\r\ninflationary  trends which had been  mentioned  by\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister had indicated that consumer prices\r\n\r\nhad risen to an average of 22.0% over the previous\r\n\r\nyear alone, that is to say, 1973 to 1974. How much\r\n\r\nmore then must consumer prices have risen over the\r\n\r\nlast  20 years? And yet there had been practically\r\n\r\nno  increase  in  personal relief except  for  the\r\n\r\n$1,000  allowed as earned income. I added that  if\r\n\r\nthe  consumer price index had risen by an  average\r\n\r\nof  25% during the last year, surely it must  have\r\n\r\ngone  up  many times since the rate of $2,000  was\r\n\r\nfixed more than 20 years ago. The final result was\r\n\r\nthat  the poor were becoming poorer and were being\r\n\r\nweighed down, especially by the income tax burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also stressed that unless personal relief was\r\n\r\nincreased, there would be little\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincentive for the tax-paying wage earner  to  work\r\n\r\nharder, because they would only be able to  retain\r\n\r\na  fraction  of the fruits of their labour  -  the\r\n\r\nbulk  of  their  increased earning being  siphoned\r\n\r\naway  by  income tax on the one hand and inflation\r\n\r\non the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was dismayed to observe the\r\n\r\nreactions of the Honourable Minister for  Finance.\r\n\r\nDespite   all   the  facts  and  figures   clearly\r\n\r\nindicating  the inequity of the position,  in  his\r\n\r\nreply  the Honourable Minister for Finance  warned\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government might consider reducing  the\r\n\r\nrate  of personal income tax relief next year,  to\r\n\r\nmake people pay more tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, Sir, left me flabbergasted. It\r\n\r\nsuggested  retaliation on bringing  out  the  true\r\n\r\nfacts  in Parliament and seeking equitable remedy.\r\n\r\nHe  has dismissed most unconcernedly the hard fact\r\n\r\nthat the personal relief on earned incomes had not\r\n\r\nbeen  increased over the last 20 years, except  by\r\n\r\n$1,000,  despite the fact that the consumer  price\r\n\r\nindex  had  gone up several times and by  his  own\r\n\r\nadmission, the consumer price index for  the  year\r\n\r\n1973-74 had gone up by nearly 25%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is noted that this year there\r\n\r\nhas  been  no increase in tax relief for the  wage\r\n\r\nearner,  and I presume that it may be argued  that\r\n\r\nany  imaginary  relief lies in the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nrate of personal income tax has not been reduced!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this context may I draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of the House to a report by an  advisor\r\n\r\nof  the  NTUC that an income of $250  a  month  is\r\n\r\nneeded  for  a  Singapore  family  to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nminimum living standard. The NTUC arrived at  this\r\n\r\nfigure  from  a study by the Defence Minister,  Dr\r\n\r\nGoh Keng Swee, on household incomes in the fifties\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was Assistant Director of Social Welfare\r\n\r\n(Social    Research)   in   the   Social   Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment. The minimum income then, according  to\r\n\r\nDr Goh's study, was $109.95 to support a family of\r\n\r\nfour.  The NTUC, which updated this report  for  a\r\n\r\nminimum living wage index,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestimated  in  March 1974 that the minimum  earned\r\n\r\nwas  $250  and that the sum of $250 was  only  for\r\n\r\nbare  necessities. Since then,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nduring the last year we have been hit by inflation\r\n\r\nand a tremendous increase in the price of consumer\r\n\r\ngoods including basic necessities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that there has been no increase in tax\r\n\r\nconcessions   would  suggest  that   the   average\r\n\r\ntaxpayer   is  now  paying  tax  on   incomes   at\r\n\r\nsubsistence  level.  A  government  dedicated   to\r\n\r\nsocialist  principles should  not  tax  income  at\r\n\r\nsubsistence  level. Otherwise, we will  be  taking\r\n\r\naway  the  bare  necessities  of  life  from   our\r\n\r\ncitizens.  This  matter,  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   is\r\n\r\nbecoming  more  and more urgent in  the  light  of\r\n\r\ninflation, which is making the purchasing power of\r\n\r\nthe  dollar less and less. We have only to  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  shops  today to see how little our dollar  is\r\n\r\nworth.  I  would therefore urge the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  to  give serious and urgent consideration\r\n\r\nto increase the personal relief for taxpayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, in rejecting our call for a reduction\r\n\r\nin the income tax relief, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nstated  that  the  international  view  was   that\r\n\r\nSingapore's  income tax relief was  very  generous\r\n\r\nand  that  Singapore could do well to broaden  its\r\n\r\ntax  base. International views are many and,  like\r\n\r\nstatistics, can be used to prove or obscure many a\r\n\r\npoint even though it may not, in actual fact, have\r\n\r\nany  relevance  at all. As regards broadening  the\r\n\r\nbase,  I  am sure nobody can quarrel with  that  - everyone  should  pay  his  fair  share,  but  the\r\n\r\nminimum income for tax exemption must be realistic\r\n\r\nand  based on actual cost of living conditions  in\r\n\r\nany particular country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with regard to broadening the base, may\r\n\r\nI  refer to the recent correspondence in the press\r\n\r\nconcerning the liability of hawkers to pay  income\r\n\r\ntax.  In  answering a query from a member  of  the\r\n\r\npublic,  the Income Tax Department mentioned  some\r\n\r\nvery  interesting facts. In the last  five  years,\r\n\r\nfrom  1969  to  1974, income tax collections  were\r\n\r\n$251  million,  $318 million, $404  million,  $563\r\n\r\nmillion and $845 million respectively. Adminis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrative  costs during the same period were  1.08%,\r\n\r\n1.01%,   0.97%,   0.75%  and  0.62%  respectively.\r\n\r\nBroadening the base of taxpayers would be one  way\r\n\r\nto  offset the loss of revenue even though it  may\r\n\r\nnot  be a hundred per cent successful, because  it\r\n\r\nis  the responsibility, as I mentioned earlier, of\r\n\r\nevery resident to pay his tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was, therefore, a bit surprised to read the\r\n\r\nviews of the Income Tax Department, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`that thus while it is a truism that everyone\r\n\r\nshould  bear  his  dutiful  burden,  it  is   also\r\n\r\nimportant, in the revenue field, to keep  also  in\r\n\r\nsight, costs and yields.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  statement,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  was  made  in\r\n\r\nreference  to the problem of collection  of  taxes\r\n\r\nfrom  hawkers.  The  Income  Tax  Department   had\r\n\r\nearlier mentioned that, and I quote again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`cost of collection from hawkers, if compliance\r\n\r\nwas  to  be as full as possible, was estimated  at\r\n\r\nmore than a hundred per cent.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is tantamount to saying\r\n\r\nthat  all of us are not equal before the law,  and\r\n\r\ncannot  be  given  the  same treatment.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  because  it is going to  be  difficult  to\r\n\r\ncollect  tax from hawkers and others who are  able\r\n\r\nto avoid, they are being allowed the concession of\r\n\r\nnot paying their share of income tax. But the poor\r\n\r\nwage earner, the employee, whose salary is on  the\r\n\r\npayroll and cannot escape has, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nto  pay tax because it is easy to collect tax from\r\n\r\nhim.  This,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is most  inequitable\r\n\r\nand  a  very unjust way of looking at the problem.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, those who are clever in  getting\r\n\r\naway  with it are allowed to do so, whereas  those\r\n\r\nwho   perforce  have  to  be  law-abiding  through\r\n\r\ncircumstances beyond their control are  penalised.\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,   Sir,   if  this   philosophy   was\r\n\r\nimplemented  in other Government departments,  and\r\n\r\ncriminals  who are difficult to catch are  allowed\r\n\r\nto go their own way whereas the amateur crook, who\r\n\r\ndoes  not  know  his  way around,  is  caught  and\r\n\r\npenalised, then Singapore will be in a sorry state\r\n\r\nof affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, total Government revenue seems\r\n\r\nquite adequate for the administration of the State\r\n\r\nand there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nappears to be every reason why some relief  should\r\n\r\nbe given to income taxpayers at the lowest levels.\r\n\r\nIt is true that such concessions may mean the loss\r\n\r\nof  a  few  million  dollars  to  the  Income  Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment,  but surely that is a  sacrifice  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government can afford, since there are  other\r\n\r\nready and available sources of revenue. But it  is\r\n\r\nobserved that the Minister for Finance has decided\r\n\r\nagainst  introducing any new taxes  for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing. It is not clear why taxes cannot be imposed\r\n\r\non luxury goods, so as to avoid taxing citizens at\r\n\r\nsubsistence level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would therefore most humbly and\r\n\r\nrespectfully  urge that serious  consideration  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the question of income tax relief,  for\r\n\r\nindeed  there  is  need for such relief  and  such\r\n\r\nrelief is even better late than never.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now turn to the subject of\r\n\r\nthe  total  estimated revenue which  is  given  as\r\n\r\n$2,647.5  million, representing a mere 5% increase\r\n\r\nover  the  revised estimate for 1974. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Finance  has  drawn  our  attention  to  the\r\n\r\nappreciable  slowdown in the  rate  of  growth  of\r\n\r\nrevenue  as  compared with previous years.  It  is\r\n\r\ninevitable  that  the slowdown in economic  growth\r\n\r\nshould  be reflected in Government revenue, unless\r\n\r\nthe  Government takes drastic measures and imposes\r\n\r\nnew taxes to increase revenue. This, of course, is\r\n\r\nundesirable at the present time. Our taxation rate\r\n\r\nis  already  high and any increase in  income  tax\r\n\r\nrates  will  serve merely to act as a disincentive\r\n\r\nto businessmen and investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it is inevitable that\r\n\r\nGovernment      expenditure      should       rise\r\n\r\ndisproportionately  with  economic  growth  for  a\r\n\r\nnumber of reasons. I would like to suggest to  the\r\n\r\nHon.  Minister for Finance that there is one  area\r\n\r\nwhich  has not as yet been fully exploited,  which\r\n\r\ncan  not only yield revenue, but also be a  social\r\n\r\nservice  to  the community. I refer to  Government\r\n\r\nbeing an entrepreneur and participating in certain\r\n\r\nareas  in  the private sector which would  provide\r\n\r\nuse-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nful  services to the public and at the  same  time\r\n\r\nsafeguard the national interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economically there are firm grounds for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  play  the  role  of  entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  government-sponsored  enterprises\r\n\r\ncan  ensure that prices be kept to the minimum and\r\n\r\nthat  profits do not flow out of the  country  but\r\n\r\nare   re-invested  or  distributed  locally.  This\r\n\r\nparticipation could also assist the Government  in\r\n\r\nits  efforts to re-structure our economy from that\r\n\r\nof  an  entrepot centre to an industrial  economy,\r\n\r\nthat  derives  its  well-being from  services  and\r\n\r\nother  fields.  In  addition,  local  and  foreign\r\n\r\ncapital  can  also be tied up with commercial  and\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade activities and can thus be  geared\r\n\r\nto  a  greater  extent  to new  projects  formerly\r\n\r\nrejected by entrepreneurs because of the risks and\r\n\r\ncapital involved. Developments in the economy  can\r\n\r\nthus  be  in  line  with  the  objectives  of  the\r\n\r\nnational plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is appreciated that Government has already\r\n\r\nventured  into wholly-owned trading  companies  or\r\n\r\njoint  venture'  with foreign and local  investors\r\n\r\nand   the   Government  bodies  also   run   along\r\n\r\ncommercial lines. I need mention only a few,  such\r\n\r\nas  the  Telecommunication Authority of Singapore,\r\n\r\nCommercial  and  Industrial Security  corporation,\r\n\r\nand Jurong and Sembawang Shipyards, as examples of\r\n\r\nthis  project. All these undertakings have  proved\r\n\r\nto be highly successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to suggest that having regard to\r\n\r\nSingapore's small size and her vulnerable position\r\n\r\nin international trade and commerce, which make us\r\n\r\nsusceptible  to external factors and international\r\n\r\ncartels, including the growing influence of multi-national corporations, more should be done in this\r\n\r\narea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen, whether local or foreign, are profit-oriented and trade is determined by the dictates\r\n\r\nof  economics. Supplies and commodities are always\r\n\r\nmade  available  to  the  highest  bidder  to  the\r\n\r\ndetriment  of  those who cannot pay.  These  harsh\r\n\r\nfacts  were brought home to all of us very clearly\r\n\r\nduring the last\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfew  years.  The price of rice, for  example,  our\r\n\r\nstaple  food,  went up sky-high  until  Government\r\n\r\nintervention  brought  prices  down  to   a   more\r\n\r\nreasonable  level.  I  would  therefore  like   to\r\n\r\nsuggest that Government explore the possibility of\r\n\r\nventuring  into  new  areas  -  those  dealing  in\r\n\r\nessential  commodities - because these  are  areas\r\n\r\nwhich  are  basic  to our survival  and  could  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  \"public utilities\" in  the  broadest\r\n\r\nsense of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the very concept of public\r\n\r\nutilities  is  that  certain requirements  of  the\r\n\r\npublic have to be state-managed so that they  will\r\n\r\nnot  be run entirely on a commercial basis and  on\r\n\r\nthe  dictates  of profit-making. It  is  generally\r\n\r\naccepted that public utilities should not  be  run\r\n\r\nby  the  private sector; hence we have the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board providing water, electricity  and\r\n\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In more recent times, our Government, recognising\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  the  State to own  some  of  these\r\n\r\nutilities,  has  taken  over trading  corporations\r\n\r\nwhich  provide  the  telephone  services  and  the\r\n\r\nexternal  telegraph services. Hence, we  now  have\r\n\r\nthe   Telecommunication   Authority,   which   has\r\n\r\nabsorbed  the former Singapore Cable and Wireless,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Telephone Board and so forth. These\r\n\r\nare essential services for the community and it is\r\n\r\ngenerally  accepted  that  Government  should  run\r\n\r\nthese organisations and provide the services.  And\r\n\r\nall  these  utilities, if I may use the word,  are\r\n\r\nprofit-making and thus Government earns revenue in\r\n\r\nan indirect way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that with the rising cost of living,\r\n\r\ninflation  and  so  forth, the  Government  should\r\n\r\nbranch  out even more into what has, in the  past,\r\n\r\nbeen regarded as private sector areas, even though\r\n\r\ncritics  may  say  that  if Government  goes  into\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  a  big  way, there  will  be  unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition. But I say unfair competition  against\r\n\r\nwhom?  Not  against the citizens,  certainly,  but\r\n\r\nagainst   the  firms  which  are  making   massive\r\n\r\nprofits.  Government participation in these  areas\r\n\r\nwill  help  keep down the cost of living  and  the\r\n\r\nprofit will go back to Government, and this can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nploughed    back   into   social   and    economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There appears to be a good case for Government to\r\n\r\nmove  into business and commerce in a bigger  way,\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the basic needs of life  for  our\r\n\r\npeople  are  not  dependent  upon  the  whims  and\r\n\r\nfancies  of businessmen who can jack up prices  at\r\n\r\nwill.  The recent rise in the price of rice  is  a\r\n\r\nfine example. Until Government intervened and made\r\n\r\ndirect   purchases  and  rice  was  sold   through\r\n\r\ncooperative  societies  and  consumer  clubs,  the\r\n\r\nprice  was unduly high and the profits went  to  a\r\n\r\nfew  merchants  who,  in total  disregard  of  our\r\n\r\npeople's  want,  were bent only on making  massive\r\n\r\nprofits for themselves. This was a totally  unfair\r\n\r\nand unjust case of events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, some businessmen might say\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  Government also enters the  trading\r\n\r\narena,  it  would  cripple  business  activity.  I\r\n\r\ncannot agree to that argument. Singapore is a fine\r\n\r\nexample   of  a  socialist-capitalist   mix,   and\r\n\r\nGovernment  participation  in  private  enterprise\r\n\r\nwill only be on a limited scale to ensure that, at\r\n\r\nany  point of time, there will still be a flow  of\r\n\r\nessential  commodities at minimum  prices  to  the\r\n\r\npublic.  This will prevent price manipulation  and\r\n\r\nhoarding by big businesses. We all have to  accept\r\n\r\nthat  for big business the sole object is  profit-making,  and if our people are left to the  tender\r\n\r\nmercies  of big business, the latter will  extract\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  price they can, thus creating  undue\r\n\r\nhardship as has already been proved. Therefore, if\r\n\r\nthe  Government also moves into these areas  which\r\n\r\nare the life-lines of the community, we can ensure\r\n\r\nthat  at  any given point of time the public  will\r\n\r\nnot be held to ransom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC supermarkets and our consumer clubs have\r\n\r\nshown how much cheaper prices can be, and the  few\r\n\r\ndollars  that the working class can save in  their\r\n\r\npurchases  from these places are a great  boon  to\r\n\r\nthem.  How much greater a boon will it be if there\r\n\r\nare   similar   state-owned,  government-sponsored\r\n\r\norganisations   providing   supplies   of    basic\r\n\r\ncommodities at minimum prices. On\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntop  of all this, the added advantage will be that\r\n\r\nthe  profit will go to Government, as I  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier.  Mr Speaker, Sir, may I suggest that  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance give this proposition serious\r\n\r\nthought  as this will help keep down the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  and ensure a continued supply of essential\r\n\r\ncommodities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  Minister for  Finance  for  his\r\n\r\nindustrial  development  policy  which  has  given\r\n\r\nadequate attention to investment needs in times of\r\n\r\nrecession.  It  is  this type of forward  planning\r\n\r\nwhich has seen our young Republic through the many\r\n\r\ncrises  which  we  have faced and  survived  since\r\n\r\n1959.   The   measures  taken  under  the   export\r\n\r\npromotion  policy  are  also  a  fine  example  of\r\n\r\nlooking ahead so that we would be well equipped to\r\n\r\ngrapple  with  problems  before  they  arise.  The\r\n\r\nproposed   establishment  of  an   export   credit\r\n\r\ninsurance guarantee scheme in conjunction with the\r\n\r\nbanking  and insurance companies is most certainly\r\n\r\nwelcome and, in fact, I would say even overdue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note this year the Government will be releasing\r\n\r\nlarge  sums of money for development purposes  and\r\n\r\nthat  this  is also meant to be a step to  counter\r\n\r\nrecession.  I was glad to observe in this  context\r\n\r\nthat he has pointed out that our anti-recessionary\r\n\r\nmeasures  will probably have inflationary effects.\r\n\r\nI  would, therefore, urge that a very tight  watch\r\n\r\nhe  kept on these two interacting factors; further\r\n\r\ninflation  will only bring greater hardship  to  a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of our citizens who at  present  are\r\n\r\nonly  just able to cope with the increased  prices\r\n\r\nof  foodstuffs and other basic commodities brought\r\n\r\nabout by imported inflation last year. I say this,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, in the full knowledge  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  set  up  an  Economic  Activation\r\n\r\nCommittee  to speed up the implementation  of  any\r\n\r\nanti-recessionary    measures,    because    over-enthusiasm  on  any  front  cannot  but  have  ill\r\n\r\neffects and negate our main objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is indeed\r\n\r\nvery  delightful and heartening to  note  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  yet  another painless budget. This has  been\r\n\r\nthe case in the past few years and it is certainly\r\n\r\na  very  satisfying reflection.  At  a  time  when\r\n\r\nnations  around  the  world  are  trying  to  free\r\n\r\nthemselves  from the strangling grip of inflation,\r\n\r\nretrenchment and recession, it is miraculous  that\r\n\r\nour  young nation could present a painless Budget.\r\n\r\nCredit  for  this  remarkable  economic  stability\r\n\r\nshould  go to our responsible Government and  also\r\n\r\nto the wisdom of our Finance Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrenchment in Singapore has reached a figure of\r\n\r\nonly  17,000, a very small number compared to  the\r\n\r\nalarming numbers frequently mentioned even in  the\r\n\r\nmost  advanced nations. Most of the employees  who\r\n\r\nlost  their jobs are not the bread-winners of  the\r\n\r\nfamily  and, as such, no notable cases of hardship\r\n\r\nhave  resulted from retrenchment in  our  country.\r\n\r\nEven  the  increases  in taxes  seem  to  be  well\r\n\r\ndesigned for they affect only those who can afford\r\n\r\nthem.  The proposed increases only affect luxuries\r\n\r\nand not our daily necessities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time now, there had been wide-spread\r\n\r\nfear  of  a terrible increase in road taxes.  This\r\n\r\nfear proved unfounded, and many people are greatly\r\n\r\nrelieved. The increase mentioned in the Budget  is\r\n\r\nreasonable  and  justified.  However,  there   are\r\n\r\nconsiderable  discrepancies in the proposed  taxes\r\n\r\nfor  motor  cars. Why must there be any difference\r\n\r\nat all? Are we aiming to swell our revenue by this\r\n\r\ntax  increase?  Are  we trying to  discourage  and\r\n\r\ndeter our car\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nowners  from  using their cars and  ultimately  to\r\n\r\nsell  them off? I know our Singaporeans too  well.\r\n\r\nBefore  they do this, we must convince  them  that\r\n\r\nour public transport system is adequate, efficient\r\n\r\nand  dependable.  At  any given  time,  breakdowns\r\n\r\noutnumber  the new buses added to each  route.  It\r\n\r\nappears  as  though there are four breakdowns  for\r\n\r\nevery  two  buses added. The scheme B  buses  have\r\n\r\nhelped  a little, but the problem is still  acute.\r\n\r\nWhen  one  takes a look at the crowd at bus  stops\r\n\r\nduring peak hours, it is not difficult for one  to\r\n\r\nnotice the severe shortage of buses on the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the needs of the present number of bus\r\n\r\ncommuters  cannot  be met, are  we  going  to  add\r\n\r\nfurther  to the incredible number of commuters  at\r\n\r\neach  bus  stop?  As a responsible  and  dedicated\r\n\r\nGovernment,  let  us  not  spare  any  efforts  to\r\n\r\nprovide  adequate number of buses  and  reasonably\r\n\r\ncomfortable  services. Once this is achieved,  car\r\n\r\nowners   will  review  their  position  and   will\r\n\r\ncertainly  consider whether it  is  worthwhile  to\r\n\r\nincur  all  these  expenses  rather  than  take  a\r\n\r\ncomfortable  ride  for only 40  cents.  This  will\r\n\r\nautomatically   eradicate   traffic    congestions\r\n\r\neverywhere. Increases, on the other hand, will not\r\n\r\ndeter them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish also to bring to the attention of this\r\n\r\nHouse  another problem which affects  the  general\r\n\r\npublic. At one time the emphasis was to centralise\r\n\r\nthe  various  Government offices. The fashion  now\r\n\r\nseems  to be to decentralise the departments.  And\r\n\r\nthey  are very far apart too. The ordinary citizen\r\n\r\nhas to travel long distances to fill a common form\r\n\r\nor   even   to   pay   an   ordinary   fee.   This\r\n\r\ndecentralisation    is    causing     considerable\r\n\r\ninconvenience  to the general public,  and  it  is\r\n\r\ncausing immense administrative difficulties  also.\r\n\r\nThe  distance  between the various departments  is\r\n\r\nalso generating an unhealthy competition, which in\r\n\r\nturn   results   in  selfishness   and   lack   of\r\n\r\ncooperation.  Some departments are even  reluctant\r\n\r\nto  release information for the benefit of others.\r\n\r\nTo improve the situation, I suggest periodical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeetings of Heads of Departments in order to bring\r\n\r\nabout     deeper    understanding    and    better\r\n\r\ncoordination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the move to retrain rather than retrench is\r\n\r\nan  admirable  step. Along with retraining,  there\r\n\r\nmust also be prudent redeployment of staff so that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be a well-balanced staff position  in\r\n\r\nall Government departments and statutory boards. I\r\n\r\nsuggest a concerted study so that we could avoid a\r\n\r\nwaste of funds and ensure an even distribution  of\r\n\r\nstaff  at  all  levels and in every department.  I\r\n\r\npropose, therefore, that the training of staff and\r\n\r\ntheir  redeployment should be  made  a  compulsory\r\n\r\nfeature  in the public service so that  one  could\r\n\r\nfit into any capacity in any department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We accept in toto the 1975 Budget and the\r\n\r\nMemorandum on the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  strongly support the tax increases as  proposed\r\n\r\nsince  they  only affect luxuries and other  items\r\n\r\nthat  can be considered as health hazards. I  need\r\n\r\nnot  emphasise  that less cars on the  road  means\r\n\r\nminimum  pollution, few accidents  and  infrequent\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestion;  less  smoking  means   fewer\r\n\r\ncancer cases and heart-attacks; and a reduction in\r\n\r\nthe  consumption  of  alcohol  would  bring  about\r\n\r\nbetter  health  all  round. The $1,000  additional\r\n\r\nearned  income relief for those above 55 years  is\r\n\r\nanother  imaginative  and  beneficial  move.  This\r\n\r\nhumanitarian gesture results in only a  negligible\r\n\r\nloss in our revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our prudent planning and farsighted efforts have\r\n\r\naverted disasters and they have even helped us  to\r\n\r\nbring  about a better balance of payments position\r\n\r\nthan  what we recorded in the years 1972 and 1973.\r\n\r\nThere have been extensive expansion all round  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently  vast  increases in  expenditure  but\r\n\r\nthey have not, in any way, adversely affected  our\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have great faith in our capacity not only to\r\n\r\nsurvive but also to overcome adversities. We  work\r\n\r\nwith one aim only - the welfare of our people -and\r\n\r\nto  achieve  this,  we will not hesitate  to  take\r\n\r\nstringent measures to prevent exploitation of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  to  stamp out corruption  and  to  uphold\r\n\r\njustice.

Members\r\n\r\nof  this  House  in congratulating the  Honourable\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance for presenting another  fair\r\n\r\nand  reasonable Budget on 3rd March, 1975, for the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  1st April, 1975  to  31st  March,\r\n\r\n1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year we achieved real growth around\r\n\r\n7% in  spite of global inflation and recession.\r\n\r\nThis  achievement of a 7% growth was made possible\r\n\r\nthrough  the tripartite cooperation of Government,\r\n\r\nManagement and Labour. I believe that so  long  as\r\n\r\nwe  maintain  this tripartite cooperation  we  can\r\n\r\novercome  many difficulties and solve the  various\r\n\r\nproblems we are now facing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year a total of 16,940 workers were\r\n\r\nretrenched  and some more will follow  this  year.\r\n\r\nLuckily   a   good  number  of  them   could   get\r\n\r\nalternative  employment. Most  of  the  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  are from the electronic, textile, garment\r\n\r\nand  wood-based industries. In fact, about 70%  of\r\n\r\nthe  total number of retrenched workers last  year\r\n\r\nwere  from  the electronic industry. This  clearly\r\n\r\nshows  that we should not depend too much  on  the\r\n\r\nelectronic  industry and we must concentrate  more\r\n\r\non sophisticated industries, such as machine-tool,\r\n\r\nindustrial     machinery,     diesel     machines,\r\n\r\nconstruction machinery, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, concerning those workers who had been\r\n\r\nretrenched  and  are still unemployed,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  who  have little skill, may I  request  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to encourage them to take up  a  study\r\n\r\nfor  some  skill work under the training programme\r\n\r\nof  the National Productivity Board. The study  is\r\n\r\nto  be  arranged in such a way that they learn  in\r\n\r\nthe NPB Training Centre and some of their time  is\r\n\r\nto   be  spent  in  the  factories  for  practical\r\n\r\nexperience.

They have the capacity  to\r\n\r\nlearn  a new trade as quickly as possible and  the\r\n\r\nability  to  achieve higher skill when  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to do so. I am glad to know  that  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial   Training  Board  has  increased   its\r\n\r\nindustrial training capacity and I hope  employers\r\n\r\nwill  give  the  workers the  necessary  time  for\r\n\r\ntraining to increase their skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have heard so much emphasis being given\r\n\r\nto workers to increase their skill and to increase\r\n\r\nproductivity  especially from the  employers,  but\r\n\r\nwhen it comes to the question of incentive payment\r\n\r\nfor the workers, there is a complete silence.

I am  sure  there\r\n\r\nare  many  employers  doing the  same  thing  like\r\n\r\nCastrol. Perhaps the Training Programme in the NPB\r\n\r\non practical course on Work Study does not include\r\n\r\nthe necessity and importance for Management to pay\r\n\r\nthe workers Productivity Incentive Payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another type of selfish greedy\r\n\r\nemployer who wants to swallow all the profits  for\r\n\r\nhimself.  I  would like to quote  from  a  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes   report  dated  22nd  February,  1975,   as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Union: MD's bonus raised fourfold `But company\r\n\r\nrefused to pay full NWC'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A laundry company increased its managing\r\n\r\ndirector's bonus by four times but refused to  pay\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of its workers the full 1974  NWC  wage\r\n\r\nincrease,  the Industrial Arbitration Court  heard\r\n\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If employers are serious and sincere about\r\n\r\nincreased  productivity, common  sense  will  tell\r\n\r\nthem  that they have to offer to the workers  what\r\n\r\nProductivity Incentive Payments they are  prepared\r\n\r\nto   pay   and  when  they  would  like  to   form\r\n\r\nProductivity    Committees.    Employers    should\r\n\r\nappreciate   that  increased  productivity   means\r\n\r\nworkers  are  entitled  to Productivity  Incentive\r\n\r\nPayment.  There  is nothing free  in  this  world.\r\n\r\nEmployers  want profit and workers would  like  to\r\n\r\nshare the profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, annually the National Wages Council gives\r\n\r\nits  recommendations on guidelines for annual wage\r\n\r\nincreases  for the workers. Since  the  NWC  is  a\r\n\r\ntripartite  representation, I  suggest  it  should\r\n\r\nalso give a guideline to the employers, especially\r\n\r\non  payment  of directors' or managing  directors'\r\n\r\nbonus. There must be a limit too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Housing and Urban Development Co, will\r\n\r\nbuild  42,000  housing units in  nine  residential\r\n\r\nareas   for  the  middle  income  group.  I   also\r\n\r\nunderstand that residents now staying in HDB fiats\r\n\r\nare interested to purchase the HUDC flats. I would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that priority of allocation for the  HUDC\r\n\r\nflats  should be given to the middle income  group\r\n\r\nfirst, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  there is any surplus flats, then they could be\r\n\r\ngiven to present HDB residents. It is not fair  to\r\n\r\nthe middle income group to allow HDB residents  to\r\n\r\njoin in the queue for the HUDC flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has very limited land and, in the\r\n\r\nnational  interest, I would request the Government\r\n\r\nto consider buying up all available vacant land in\r\n\r\nSingapore    for    residential   or    industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  All  land that  is  vacant  and  not\r\n\r\ndeveloped for three years, the Government must  be\r\n\r\ngiven  the power to take over after paying a  fair\r\n\r\nprice.   We  must  not  allow  local  or   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors to buy up our land and to speculate  for\r\n\r\nfantastic  profits.  I  am sure  when  the  global\r\n\r\ninflation  and  recession  subside  and  with  the\r\n\r\nimprovement  of our economy, prices  of  land  and\r\n\r\nhousing  will go up again. To avoid this land  and\r\n\r\nhousing   speculation,  the  buying  up   of   all\r\n\r\navailable  land  by the Government  will  help  to\r\n\r\nstabilise  the prices of housing especially  under\r\n\r\nthe HDB and HUDC projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the number of tourists visiting Singapore\r\n\r\nlast  year exceeded the one million mark. Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  tourists  have been fleeced  by  touts  and\r\n\r\nshopkeepers.  This  gives  a  very  bad  image  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and, if fleecing is not curbed, it  will\r\n\r\nbe  damaging to our tourist industry. All tourists\r\n\r\nlike to do their shopping in Singapore because  of\r\n\r\nthe  variety  of  things at reasonable  prices.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that one best way to tackle this  problem\r\n\r\nof fleecing is to establish a Co-operative Tourist\r\n\r\nShopping Centre through a joint enterprise between\r\n\r\nNTUC and Government. Perhaps the Tourist Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  can  also help in this matter. I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and NTUC would consider this guaranteed\r\n\r\nprofit-making enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my\r\n\r\ncolleagues in this House in giving full support to\r\n\r\nthe Budget statement presented by the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance to Parliament on 3rd March, 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, a Budget\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatement for any particular fiscal year  will  be\r\n\r\nwelcomed  by members of the public if  it  is  not\r\n\r\naccompanied  by an increase in taxation.  However,\r\n\r\nunder normal circumstances, Government expenditure\r\n\r\nwill  rise  year  after  year.  This  increase  in\r\n\r\nexpenditure will have to be met by an increase  in\r\n\r\nrevenue. It is correct and proper for the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  to  increase taxes  on  tobacco  and\r\n\r\nliquor.  However,  the ways  in  which  taxes  are\r\n\r\nraised  and whether the method is right  or  wrong\r\n\r\nwill have to be discussed by us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Minister in raising the\r\n\r\ntaxes  on liquor and tobacco. I would even suggest\r\n\r\nthat  there should be a further punitive  increase\r\n\r\nin  taxes for these two items because they are bad\r\n\r\nhabits and a waste of money to indulge in. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  people will shun these bad habits  which  are\r\n\r\ndetrimental  to health and a waste of money.  This\r\n\r\nwill  be  in  line  with the  Government's  recent\r\n\r\ncampaign to promote health among the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to increase road tax steeply and the way in\r\n\r\nwhich  this  road  tax  is  increased  merits  our\r\n\r\ndiscussion. At this juncture, we are not going  to\r\n\r\nargue  whether  owning a car  is  a  luxury  or  a\r\n\r\nnecessity in this space age. To increase road  tax\r\n\r\nmay  prevent people from buying new cars and  this\r\n\r\nwill  help alleviate traffic congestion.  However,\r\n\r\nlooking at the different rates of road tax  levied\r\n\r\non  the different types of cars, it seems that the\r\n\r\nmiddle  and lower income groups will have to  bear\r\n\r\nthe  brunt of such taxation because, according  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, cars under the 1000 cc  range  will\r\n\r\nhave  their tax increased by 6 cts per  cc,  those\r\n\r\nbetween 1000 cc and 1600 cc will have their tax in\r\n\r\ncreased by 8 cts per cc, and those between 2000 cc\r\n\r\nand 3000 cc will have their tax increased by 5 cts\r\n\r\nper  cc.  We  know that only the big  tycoons  and\r\n\r\ncapitalists  can afford to own big cars.  It  does\r\n\r\nnot matter to them how much road tax is increased.\r\n\r\nMainly  the  salaried class in  middle  and  lower\r\n\r\nincome groups own medium-sized and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmall-sized cars. There are also small businessmen\r\n\r\nwho use their small cars to transport goods and as\r\n\r\na means to save labour and time in order to make a\r\n\r\nmeagre profit. In actual fact, to them the car has\r\n\r\nbecome a necessity in their work or business and a\r\n\r\nmeans  of  making a living. It is  something  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot do without. I regret to say  that  in\r\n\r\norder   to   cope   with  the  yearly   increasing\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  our Hon. Minister  for  Finance  has\r\n\r\nresorted  to increase road tax on the  middle  and\r\n\r\nlower income groups. Therefore, the rates of  road\r\n\r\ntax  on medium and small-sized cars are more  than\r\n\r\nthose  on big-sized cars. In the midst of mounting\r\n\r\ninflation today, this has caused great hardship to\r\n\r\nthese  people who earn their living from  hand  to\r\n\r\nmouth.  No  wonder there is widespread  discontent\r\n\r\nand  complaint by the people that as the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance was an ex-senior civil servant in the\r\n\r\ncolonial era the Budget drafted by him serves only\r\n\r\nthe interests of the capitalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another point, in respect of the amount of tax\r\n\r\nrelief as concession to the aged employees, namely\r\n\r\nthose who are over 55 years of age, the amount  of\r\n\r\nrelief  on  earned income is to be increased  from\r\n\r\nthe  original $1,000 to $2,000. Those who are over\r\n\r\n60  will  have  their  earned  income  tax  relief\r\n\r\nincreased  from  $1,000 to $3,000.  The  rationale\r\n\r\nbehind  this  is that people who have reached  the\r\n\r\nretiring age and are still able to work need  that\r\n\r\nmuch  money to keep themselves healthy. This seems\r\n\r\nplausible.  This measure will act as an  incentive\r\n\r\nfor  elderly  people  who  are  more  skilled  and\r\n\r\nexperienced to go on working. If I could represent\r\n\r\nour  elderly  people, I would convey my  heartfelt\r\n\r\ngratitude to the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what these elderly people need more is\r\n\r\nmedical care. There are people who have worked and\r\n\r\nstruggled  throughout  their  life  to  save  some\r\n\r\nmoney,  and  when they retire their lifelong  hard\r\n\r\nsavings are passed on to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoctor  for medical fees within a short period  of\r\n\r\ntime. They will then be on the verge of starvation\r\n\r\nuntil the day when they are summoned to heaven  by\r\n\r\nthe  Lord.  In this respect, retired  teachers  in\r\n\r\naided  schools  have  gone  through  such  painful\r\n\r\nexperience  because, under current regulations  on\r\n\r\nthe day an aided school teacher retires he has  to\r\n\r\ngive  up  his  Medical Benefits Entitlement  Card.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  raising of tax relief  on  earned\r\n\r\nincome  for  the elderly people announced  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister is, on the face of it, a token of respect\r\n\r\nand  a  most  generous gesture. It  is  just  like\r\n\r\nbuying  a Big Sweep ticket so that everybody  will\r\n\r\nhave the hope of winning a prize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister has done quite a lot of daily\r\n\r\nwork with his computer. He has the calculation  at\r\n\r\nthe  tips of his fingers that there are only  very\r\n\r\nfew  people who are above the stipulated  age  and\r\n\r\nworking;  so his jolly talk, because most  of  the\r\n\r\nemployees  will have to retire at the age  of  55.\r\n\r\nOnly  those big towkays can carry on working after\r\n\r\nreaching  their  retiring age. Therefore,  if  the\r\n\r\nMinister could use more sophisticated computers to\r\n\r\ndo more sophisticated calculations and if he could\r\n\r\nbe  more  charitable and be more generous  to  the\r\n\r\nend,  he  could more heartily announce that  those\r\n\r\nwho  attain  the age of 70 and are still  fit  and\r\n\r\nallowed to work, the tax relief for earned  income\r\n\r\nwould  be  increased to $5,000, and for those  who\r\n\r\nhave  the art of longevity, living up to 80  years\r\n\r\nor over and are still allowed to work, they should\r\n\r\nbe  regarded as national treasures and be  totally\r\n\r\nexempted from earned income tax. In addition, they\r\n\r\nshould be given a free trip round the world.  Does\r\n\r\nthis  not  go  to show that the Minister  is  more\r\n\r\ncharitable,  generous and is more  concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of the elderly people? I believe that\r\n\r\nall  the elderly people perhaps will bless him and\r\n\r\npray  everyday for his longevity. From  these  two\r\n\r\npoints  that I have raised, it could be seen  that\r\n\r\nthe Budget has only made provision for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the  capitalists, the wealthy people  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr L.

I will not go\r\n\r\ninto  an examination of the details of the Budget,\r\n\r\nas  I  have observed that my colleagues have  made\r\n\r\nvery  incisive and pertinent references  to  these\r\n\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I begin by noting the Minister's Budget\r\n\r\nstatement   read  with  his  Economic  Survey   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in 1974 as a modest quiet statement  of\r\n\r\nour  efforts and gains during a difficult year and\r\n\r\nour  economic  plans  for  the  years  ahead,   in\r\n\r\nparticular for 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A growth of 6.8% acquired in a year of world\r\n\r\neconomic   instability  as  the  economic   survey\r\n\r\nevinces  is  not something insignificant  but  the\r\n\r\nMinister  chooses  to regard  it  as  merely  \"not\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory\",  quite  characteristic   of   his\r\n\r\nmodest nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the strategy to contain the impact of further\r\n\r\nworld  recession  on  our economy,  the  statement\r\n\r\nstresses the diversification of our industries and\r\n\r\nservices and that we should continue to strive for\r\n\r\nhigher  growth rates. New skills and technological\r\n\r\nknowledge  are  being introduced  into  metal  and\r\n\r\nprecision  engineering, chemical and  electronics.\r\n\r\nMore  skilled and knowledge workers will be needed\r\n\r\nto make Singapore a centre for services, technical\r\n\r\nknow-how,  tourism  and  finance.  This   strategy\r\n\r\nunderlines  the manpower factor in our  plans  for\r\n\r\nfuture economic growth. I wish to dwell briefly on\r\n\r\nthis   subject  and  make  reference  to   matters\r\n\r\nassociated with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now we do not question the term \"global city\"\r\n\r\nwhen  a reference is made to our city, as our city\r\n\r\ntrades with the whole world and it centralises the\r\n\r\norganisation   and  management  of   our   rapidly\r\n\r\nindustrialising  state, which  is  structured  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment    along   the    lines    of    other\r\n\r\ntechnologically  advanced industrial  states  with\r\n\r\nwhich we compete for economic gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This modernisation of our economy has\r\n\r\nnecessitated  the training and production  of  the\r\n\r\nengineering  man,  the building  and  construction\r\n\r\nman, the businessman, the banking man, the science\r\n\r\nman,  the electronics man, the economics man,  the\r\n\r\ncomputer man, the organisation man and a  host  of\r\n\r\nother  men and the skilled workmen. We have  spent\r\n\r\nand are continuing to spend large amounts of money\r\n\r\neducating and training our own citizens to be such\r\n\r\nmen.  In  doing  so we are giving these  men,  the\r\n\r\ntechnocrats,  considerable economic relevance  and\r\n\r\nworth   in   the  modern  world  of  science   and\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global cities of industrial states in the world\r\n\r\ntoo  have  a  need of such skilled  and  knowledge\r\n\r\nworkers, and there has therefore been movements of\r\n\r\nsuch  workers between and among these cities.  The\r\n\r\nemergence of the multinational companies and their\r\n\r\noperations in global cities throughout  the  world\r\n\r\nwith   their  capacity  to  absorb  manpower  have\r\n\r\nprovided  the  opportunity  for  the  skilled  and\r\n\r\nknowledge worker to shift his habitat,  if  he  so\r\n\r\ndesires.  The  modernisation of  our  economy  has\r\n\r\nintroduced our global city into the big league, so\r\n\r\nto  speak,  and  present us with  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nmanpower  loss which can eventuate into  a  matter\r\n\r\nfor concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant development in the world today is\r\n\r\nthe increasing similarisation of urban life-styles\r\n\r\nso  that an urban dweller from a city in the Third\r\n\r\nWorld  does not find life in a global  city  of  a\r\n\r\nmore  advanced industrial country art unmanageable\r\n\r\npersonal  disruption, if it is any  disruption  at\r\n\r\nall.  Usually life in a global city of an advanced\r\n\r\nindustrial  country is accepted with ease  by  the\r\n\r\nprospective  resident worker  who  regards  it  as\r\n\r\nholding  more  promises  of  opportunities  for  a\r\n\r\ncomfortable life. The movement of the skilled  and\r\n\r\nknowledge  worker  from  former  colonies  to  the\r\n\r\ncities  of the former colonial countries in Europe\r\n\r\nhad begun when these advanced industrial countries\r\n\r\nyielded  to  the logic and guilt of  the  colonial\r\n\r\nexperience in Africa, Asia and the West Indies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  allowed  into their cities large  numbers  of\r\n\r\nhopeful  and  aspiring Asians, Africans  and  West\r\n\r\nIndians  before  controls  were  applied.  In  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth today there has been some movement of\r\n\r\nskilled  and  knowledge  workers  from  cities  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries to those  in  more  advanced\r\n\r\ncountries  such  as  Canada,  Australia  and   New\r\n\r\nZealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other factors assist such movement of manpower.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  travelling  distances  today  is  a\r\n\r\nconvenient matter. The rights and expectations  of\r\n\r\nthe  worker  in the western democracies  are  more\r\n\r\nliberal and entrenched in the relationship between\r\n\r\nthe   trade  unions  on  the  one  hand  and   the\r\n\r\nmanagement   in   private   industries   and   the\r\n\r\ngovernment on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global cities in Europe and the Commonwealth arc\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan.   They   are   not   found   to   be\r\n\r\ndiscouragingly  foreign to  the  worker  from  the\r\n\r\nThird World.

In the face of international  economic\r\n\r\ndepression, it is commendable for the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  to  be able to present to  this  House  a\r\n\r\nBudget which does not adversely affect our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Economic Survey of Singapore for 1974 the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance highlighted the fact that the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector had a very good  performance,\r\n\r\nshowing  a  28% increase in value added,  although\r\n\r\nthe  real  output at constant prices increased  by\r\n\r\nonly  2%.  The  value  of production  amounted  to\r\n\r\n$3,245  million.  Faced  with  a  declining  world\r\n\r\ndemand,  we were still able to export 54%  of  our\r\n\r\ndomestic  production. This shows that there  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  close  link in our international trade  with\r\n\r\nthe  world at large. It also underlines  the  good\r\n\r\nquality  of  our goods which are known  for  being\r\n\r\ngood and at the same time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncheap  and  very  well  accepted  internationally.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  all these factors our external  trade\r\n\r\ncontinued to grow very substantially last year and\r\n\r\nthe increase amounted to $13,144 million. Compared\r\n\r\nto  1973  there  was an increase of 37%.  External\r\n\r\ntrade has always been one of our main lifelines in\r\n\r\nour economy. In the past we only provided entrepot\r\n\r\nservices  without our own production  for  export.\r\n\r\nBut   since   a   decade  ago   the   Government's\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme has been in full swing\r\n\r\nand    development   in   the    industrial    and\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sectors has been tremendous  indeed.\r\n\r\nWe  have  been  able to produce  a  lot  of  daily\r\n\r\nnecessities, canned food, machinery, etc. This has\r\n\r\nenhanced our status as an exporter and has  earned\r\n\r\nus a lot of foreign exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Development Estimates for the financial\r\n\r\nyear  1975-76,  the Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nhas been granted a loan of $718 million. This loan\r\n\r\nis   meant  for  public  housing.  It  shows   the\r\n\r\ndetermination  of  the  Government   to   speedily\r\n\r\npromote    home-ownership   among   our    people.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly this beneficial measure will be warmly\r\n\r\nwelcomed  by the people at large. As a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfact, this massive public housing scheme will  not\r\n\r\nonly  accelerate  the  allocation  of  housing  to\r\n\r\nthousands  of people on the waiting list,  but  it\r\n\r\nwill  also provide jobs for thousands of  building\r\n\r\nconstruction  workers as well as affording  better\r\n\r\ndevelopment opportunity for industries and  trades\r\n\r\nrelated  to  the building industry. This  gives  a\r\n\r\nboost  to  our  economic  prosperity  and  a  good\r\n\r\ncounter-recessionary measure. At  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance pointed  out  that,  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to 1973 where there was a drop  of  15%,\r\n\r\nthe  private construction sector showed a  further\r\n\r\n`drop  of 11% in 1974. This shows that the private\r\n\r\nbuilding industry fared very poorly last year  and\r\n\r\nis  on  the decline. The Government has  no  doubt\r\n\r\ntaken  some  remedial action  which  includes  the\r\n\r\nrelaxation  on  the control of  housing  loan  and\r\n\r\npermission for aliens to buy flats in buildings of\r\n\r\nmore than six storeys high. But after implementing\r\n\r\nthese measures over the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npast  few  months,  transactions  in  the  private\r\n\r\nhousing  industry do not seem to  have  picked  up\r\n\r\nvery much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to help the private building industry to\r\n\r\ndevelop and to ensure that this industry will make\r\n\r\na  better contribution to our national economy,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the Minister for Finance may  find  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  further relax the  control  on  the\r\n\r\npurchase  of houses by aliens. This is because  if\r\n\r\nthe  private  building industry is  still  in  the\r\n\r\ndoldrums  it will be a setback to our  efforts  to\r\n\r\ndiversify our economy. At the same time,  all  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  people connected with  the  building\r\n\r\nindustry will be adversely affected. These  people\r\n\r\ninclude  architects,  civil engineers,  electrical\r\n\r\nengineers,   surveyors,  quantity  surveyors   and\r\n\r\ndraughts-men. Furthermore, lawyers and accountants\r\n\r\nas  well  as  valuers who are  also  in  some  way\r\n\r\nconnected with the private building industry  will\r\n\r\nalso   be   affected.  According   to   unofficial\r\n\r\nestimates  there are about 5,000  such  people  in\r\n\r\nall,  and  80%  of them are local citizens.  These\r\n\r\npeople  have received high education in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  some  have  returned from  foreign  countries\r\n\r\nafter  receiving higher education. Their  business\r\n\r\nand professional practices are closely related  to\r\n\r\nthe  private  building industry.  If  the  private\r\n\r\nbuilding  industry  is  allowed  to  continue   to\r\n\r\ndecline,  they  will be adversely affected.  Since\r\n\r\nthe  Government pays so much emphasis on the elite\r\n\r\nand  the  utilization of their skills,  it  should\r\n\r\nalso  pay attention to their livelihood so  as  to\r\n\r\nprevent a brain drain overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has emphasised a need\r\n\r\nfor    the   diversification   of   our   economic\r\n\r\nactivities.  This  is a very correct  strategy  to\r\n\r\nadopt.  Diversification of the economy means  that\r\n\r\napart  from the positive development of industries\r\n\r\nthere is also the need to expand our manufacturing\r\n\r\nbase,  particularly  in  relation  to  metal   and\r\n\r\nprecision    engineering,    chemical    industry,\r\n\r\nelectronic     industry    and     transportation.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, international trade, shipbuilding and\r\n\r\ntourism   are  also  our  great  foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nearners. They are the great\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npillars of our diversified economic activities. As\r\n\r\na  matter  of fact, as Singapore is the centre  of\r\n\r\ninternational transport and communication in South-east  Asia  there is plenty of scope  for  further\r\n\r\ndiversification  in our economy. For  example,  in\r\n\r\nthe timber and textile industries, no doubt in the\r\n\r\nlast year these two industries have been adversely\r\n\r\naffected by international recession. But  in  1973\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  big  boom in the  timber  industry.\r\n\r\nAccording  to available statistics,  in  1973  the\r\n\r\nexport  of timber amounted to 1,157 million  cubic\r\n\r\nmetres, valued at $305 million. Our main customers\r\n\r\nwere France, South Africa and England. But in 1974\r\n\r\nthis   business  dropped  by  40%.  According   to\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  in the timber trade, apart  from  the\r\n\r\ndecline   in  the  demand  for  timber  owing   to\r\n\r\ninternational     economic    depression,     some\r\n\r\nunscrupulous timber merchants had exported  timber\r\n\r\nof    a    quality   not   in   accordance    with\r\n\r\nspecifications,   and  this   has   affected   the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of international buyers in our  timber\r\n\r\ntrade.  If  that allegation is true  I  think  the\r\n\r\nTimber  Export Department and Forestry  Department\r\n\r\nshould  be answerable, because it is the  business\r\n\r\nof   these   two  Departments  to  ensure   proper\r\n\r\nsupervision and grading of our timber and to raise\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of timber as well as  to  carry  out\r\n\r\nresearch  in this trade. Therefore, if  there  had\r\n\r\nbeen  any non-compliance of specifications in this\r\n\r\nrespect,  can  the reasons be established?  Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  the  staff  had been negligent  in  their\r\n\r\nduties?  I  hope the Minister concerned will  look\r\n\r\ninto the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, our timber re-export trade\r\n\r\nhas a very good future. This is because we are  in\r\n\r\nthe centre of South-east Asia, and our neighbours,\r\n\r\nMalaysia   and  Indonesia,  are  timber  producing\r\n\r\ncountries.   We  have  a  very  modern  commercial\r\n\r\ninfrastructure    -port    facilities,    banking,\r\n\r\nwarehousing,   insurance  and  telecommunications.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Government  should  attach  great\r\n\r\nimportance  to  the  timber  re-export  trade  and\r\n\r\nimprove  the  administrative  efficiency  of   the\r\n\r\nTimber  Export Department, so as to make Singapore\r\n\r\na centre for timber drying and treating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother  important activity is timber  processing,\r\n\r\nsuch as manufacturing furniture, wooden doors  and\r\n\r\nwindows and other industrial timber products. This\r\n\r\nindustry  is  flourishing in Taiwan, Korea,  Japan\r\n\r\nand other European countries. So we can take a cue\r\n\r\nfrom them and try to catch up. In promoting timber\r\n\r\nprocessing  and re-exporting we may be faced  with\r\n\r\nsome  problems, such as the provision  of  factory\r\n\r\nsites,  capital and technical personnel.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect   the   Government  should  give   certain\r\n\r\nencouragement  and assistance.  For  example,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can provide factory sites near the  sea\r\n\r\ncoast  for the processing and drying of timber  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate the import and export of the commodity.\r\n\r\nBut   since  a  large  capital  is  required,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should consider granting a tax  holiday\r\n\r\nfor this industry and give whatever financial aids\r\n\r\nor   loans  that  may  be  required.  As   regards\r\n\r\ntechnical  personnel,  if  we  lack  local  people\r\n\r\nperhaps a relaxation of immigration regulations in\r\n\r\nregard   to  such  people  from  abroad   can   be\r\n\r\nconsidered. According to estimates there are about\r\n\r\n116   sawmills   in  Singapore  and   309   timber\r\n\r\nexporters, making timber quite a big business.  So\r\n\r\nreactivation  of  timber industry  will  not  only\r\n\r\ncontribute  to the diversification of our  economy\r\n\r\nbut also provide jobs for thousands of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the question of tax\r\n\r\nincreases. Generally speaking, there should be  no\r\n\r\ncomplaint  against tax increases  on  tobacco  and\r\n\r\nliquor because they do not affect the people  very\r\n\r\nmuch. But what is unfortunate is that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance has also increased road  tax,  and  I\r\n\r\nfeel that this is quite unreasonable. For example,\r\n\r\nfor  vehicles in the range of 1000 cc to 1600  cc,\r\n\r\nthe  increase is about 50%. Vehicles in this range\r\n\r\nare  actually  small  and  medium-sized  and  they\r\n\r\nconstitute more than 80% of the number of vehicles\r\n\r\nregistered. For vehicles of more than 3000 cc  the\r\n\r\ntax  increase  is 5 cents per cc,  which  is  only\r\n\r\nabout  15%.  Vehicles in the 1000 cc  to  1600  cc\r\n\r\nrange  are commonly owned by people in the  middle\r\n\r\nincome  group  in the private and public  sectors.\r\n\r\nTheir income is not very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch.  So  the  Government should sympathize  with\r\n\r\nthem and not further aggravate their burden in the\r\n\r\nface  of  inflation. Therefore, I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the  Minister to avoid increasing  the\r\n\r\nroad tax in respect of vehicles in this range.  If\r\n\r\nat  all  an  increase is necessary and inevitable,\r\n\r\nthen  it  should be reasonable and I would suggest\r\n\r\nthat an increase from 17 cents to 20 cents per  cc\r\n\r\nwould  be more reasonable than an increase  of  as\r\n\r\nmuch as 50%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards luxury vehicles of 3000 cc and above,\r\n\r\nI  feel that the increase is not adequate.  As  we\r\n\r\nall  know,  a person who can afford a car  costing\r\n\r\n$50,000  or  more must be a very rich man  with  a\r\n\r\nvery  handsome income. Since he has a big  income,\r\n\r\nhe  is  certainly able and expects to  pay  higher\r\n\r\ntaxes.  So  the Minister should actually  readjust\r\n\r\nthe  tax  increase, as it does not appear fair  to\r\n\r\nimpose  only a nominal increase in this  range  of\r\n\r\nluxury cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance also announced two\r\n\r\ntax  concessions. But these concessions  are  only\r\n\r\napplicable  to  people who are 55  years  old  and\r\n\r\nabove.  As  from  the 1976 year of assessment  the\r\n\r\nearned  income relief of those beyond 55 years  of\r\n\r\nage will be increased from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$1,000 to $2,000, and for those over\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60  years  their  earned  income  relief  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased from $1,000 to $3,000. But those who are\r\n\r\nunder 55 will get no further relief at all. Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport  these tax concessions in principle.  But,\r\n\r\nas  a  matter of fact, I doubt whether many people\r\n\r\nwill  benefit from these concessions. I think  the\r\n\r\nnumber  will be few and far between. In the public\r\n\r\nsector, there is the compulsory retirement age  of\r\n\r\n55  years. Public servants who retire will have no\r\n\r\nincome  at all; so how can they benefit  from  the\r\n\r\ntax  relief  on  earned  income?  In  the  private\r\n\r\nsector, I feel that the number of such people will\r\n\r\nalso  be very small. Again, I think the number  of\r\n\r\nthose who benefit from these tax concessions  must\r\n\r\nhave   been  very  carefully  calculated  by   the\r\n\r\nMinister, and the benefits, if I may say  so,  are\r\n\r\nmore  imaginary than real. Since the benefits  are\r\n\r\nmore imaginary than real, the loss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin revenue is negligible, if at all. Therefore, in\r\n\r\nmy  view,  these  tax concessions  should  not  be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to the age qualifications of employees.\r\n\r\nThis is a very reasonable expectation. As a matter\r\n\r\nof  fact, the present personal relief on income is\r\n\r\ninadequate because it was fixed more than 20 years\r\n\r\nago  when  the value of money was much higher  and\r\n\r\nthe   prices  of  commodities  were  much   lower.\r\n\r\nCompared to the present level, I think prices have\r\n\r\ngone  up  a  great deal. But the  tax  relief  has\r\n\r\nremained  unchanged.  So  how  can  this   measure\r\n\r\nrelieve   the   burden  of  the  salaried   class?\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  feel  that the  wise  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance   should  make  some  wise  tax  reduction\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the proposal to remove the age limit\r\n\r\ncannot  be  agreed to, perhaps I can make  another\r\n\r\nsuggestion, and that is, in respect of  those  who\r\n\r\nmaintain  their  aged parents and grandparents.  I\r\n\r\nthink  a  similar tax relief should be  considered\r\n\r\nsince  the  Government is encouraging citizens  to\r\n\r\nhave  their parents stay with them so that members\r\n\r\nof  the  family can be better looked after.  These\r\n\r\npeople  should  he given tax concessions  so  that\r\n\r\nthey   will  be  better  able  to  maintain  their\r\n\r\nparents.  Otherwise, with more  taxes  taken  from\r\n\r\nthem,  these  people  might not  be  in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition,  or in any position at all, to  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir parents who may thus suffer. This is one way\r\n\r\nthat the Government can encourage respect for  the\r\n\r\naged people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in short, the annual Budget statement is\r\n\r\nhighly   commendable.  In  terms  of  policy   for\r\n\r\nindustrial and commercial development, we can  see\r\n\r\nthe  determination  of and the  positive  measures\r\n\r\ntaken  by our Government to counter recession  and\r\n\r\nto  promote  economic development,  which  is  the\r\n\r\nbasic  spirit  of  the Budget.  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance also predicted that our economy would turn\r\n\r\nfor the better in the latter half of this year.  I\r\n\r\nhope that he is not wrong in his prediction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the turn for the better in the\r\n\r\ninternational situation, another factor that  will\r\n\r\nbe  required for our development and prosperity is\r\n\r\nthe good quality of our people. Therefore, our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  should continue to develop and demonstrate\r\n\r\nthis  spirit  of diligence and dogged  effort  and\r\n\r\nhelp  to  implement  the  wise  policies  of   our\r\n\r\nGovernment  so  that in the coming  year  we  will\r\n\r\nachieve greater prosperity and progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the policy of the annual Budget\r\n\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.38 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the same breath, in\r\n\r\nexpressing  his  reluctance to  increase  taxation\r\n\r\n\"lest  it  should  raise the prices  of  essential\r\n\r\ngoods  and services, especially food and clothing,\r\n\r\npublic  transport and housing\", the Hon.  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance argued that \"additional revenue  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  come  from increased taxes  on  tobacco,\r\n\r\nliquor  and  cars\". Transportation  is  vital  for\r\n\r\nessential commodities like vegetables, fish,  meat\r\n\r\nand  so  on,  to be taken to markets for  sale  to\r\n\r\nconsumers.  Vans,  cars,  motorcycles  with  side-carriages,  the  majority  of  which  are   petrol\r\n\r\ndriven,  are utilised to transport these essential\r\n\r\ncommodities to markets. The increase in  the  road\r\n\r\ntax  of  vehicles would mean increasing  costs  in\r\n\r\ntransportation   of   essential   commodities   to\r\n\r\nmarkets. My fear is that this will cause increases\r\n\r\nin  the  prices of essential commodities  and  the\r\n\r\nconsumer   will  have  to  pay  more   for   these\r\n\r\nessentials.  If  the rationale  behind  increasing\r\n\r\nroad tax for motor vehicles is to limit the number\r\n\r\nof cars on the roads because of traffic congestion\r\n\r\nand  air pollution, then taxation at source  would\r\n\r\nbe more realistic. In addition, stringent measures\r\n\r\ncould also be introduced to ensure that only  road\r\n\r\nworthy  vehicles  are allowed on roads  as  poorly\r\n\r\nmaintained   vehicles  cause  not   only   traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion,  because  of  constant  stalling   and\r\n\r\nbreakdowns,  but  also  air pollution  because  of\r\n\r\nwornout machine parts that lead to excessive smoke\r\n\r\nbeing  emitted.  However, if the rationale  is  to\r\n\r\nincrease   the   Government  revenue   to   offset\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  surely another  method  of  taxation\r\n\r\nwhich  will not cause price increases of essential\r\n\r\ncommodities could be introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to make mention that the\r\n\r\nBudget statement was tempered\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  compassion  in its consideration  for  those\r\n\r\nabove  55  and  above 60 years  of  age.  The  tax\r\n\r\nconcession offered to working people over  55  and\r\n\r\nover  60  years old is indeed a gesture of  humane\r\n\r\nregard for their long years of contribution to our\r\n\r\nRepublic. In addition to their being able to spend\r\n\r\nmore  money staying healthy and getting  to  work,\r\n\r\nthey  will  have a sense of importance because  of\r\n\r\ntheir recognition by Government. They will also be\r\n\r\nable  to  spend  a few extra dollars,  which  they\r\n\r\nalways  do, without too much constraint for  their\r\n\r\nchildren  and  their grandchildren, especially  on\r\n\r\noccasions   like   birthdays,  anniversaries   and\r\n\r\nfestivals.  As people get older they  need  to  be\r\n\r\nreassured  from time to time that they are  wanted\r\n\r\nby  society, a society that they have  spent  many\r\n\r\nyears  working  for.  The  method  introduced   by\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  reassure these  people  is  indeed\r\n\r\npraiseworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the importance of tripartite cooperation\r\n\r\namong the Government, employers and workers cannot\r\n\r\nbe  overemphasised. And I am in absolute agreement\r\n\r\nwith   the   Hon.  Minister.  This  is   a   major\r\n\r\nrequirement for Singapore's continued progress and\r\n\r\nprosperity  in  times like this or  at  any  other\r\n\r\ntime.  In the midst of rapid technological change,\r\n\r\nour  nation  and  our  people  have  accepted  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  and  the  hardships  of  change.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment harnessed the change, painful though it\r\n\r\nmight  have been, for the benefit of the community\r\n\r\nas a whole and for gaining economic strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we need to speed up the pace of\r\n\r\nindustrial training to ensure that those  affected\r\n\r\nby  industrial change are given the opportunity to\r\n\r\nbe  trained to take advantage of the jobs that new\r\n\r\ngrowth  industries  are  providing.  We  are   too\r\n\r\ndependent  on  imported skills in many  industrial\r\n\r\nareas.  Employers  are not playing  a  significant\r\n\r\nenough  role  in the industrial training  process.\r\n\r\nThey must be required not only to promote but also\r\n\r\nto assist in the promotion of industrial training.\r\n\r\nIn  addition, it is necessary for us to  keep  our\r\n\r\ngoods  competitive by keeping costs  from  rising.\r\n\r\nThis  can  be  done effectively  by  economies  in\r\n\r\nmanning and the elimination of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwaste.  This is a positive way and is a sure  road\r\n\r\nto higher real wages and high standards of living.\r\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  this is not practised  religiously\r\n\r\nby   employers.  There  is  also  a  tendency  for\r\n\r\nemployers to seek to take industrial relations out\r\n\r\nof  the field of human relations. This tendency is\r\n\r\ndetrimental   to  worker-management   cooperation.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  future in this direction  and  this\r\n\r\ntendency should be strongly deprecated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, at first I had\r\n\r\nnot  intended `to participate in the debate on the\r\n\r\nBudget,  but after hearing the views  of  so  many\r\n\r\nMembers  who have spoken, I feel I should  involve\r\n\r\nmyself in this debate and speak, if only briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the Budget as presented by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Finance.  It  is  a  very  moderate   Budget\r\n\r\nconsidering   the   problems  of   inflation   and\r\n\r\nrecession all over the world. In debating  matters\r\n\r\nconnected  with tax increases one thing should  be\r\n\r\nborne  in  mind. It is a truism that not a  single\r\n\r\nFinance Minister is able to present a budget  that\r\n\r\neverybody  could accept with a smile.  Only  those\r\n\r\nwho  benefit will smile but those who are affected\r\n\r\nwill always complain. It is like a father who  has\r\n\r\nperhaps  five  or six children to look  after.  He\r\n\r\nwill not be able to satisfy all of them. I feel we\r\n\r\nare  lucky to have a Minister for Finance  who  is\r\n\r\nefficient, but humble and publicity-shy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the reference made to his service\r\n\r\nduring the colonial regime, I would like to remind\r\n\r\nMembers  here that history has shown that not  all\r\n\r\nthose people who worked during the colonial period\r\n\r\nare  traitors to the nation. In fact, many of them\r\n\r\nbecame  heroes  in  their fight for  independence.\r\n\r\nHistory has also shown that many people who fought\r\n\r\nfor  independence were opposed to colonialism, but\r\n\r\nthe  moment they attained independence they became\r\n\r\ntraitors  to their nation's cause. So the question\r\n\r\nof personality should not be raised in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  because,  as  I  said earlier,  no  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  can  present  a  budget  that  will   be\r\n\r\nreceived with a smile by every individual citizen.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to stress to Members  that  we  are\r\n\r\nindeed   lucky  to  have  a  very  polite  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister who works hard without any publicity  and\r\n\r\nis  able  to present a budget that can  bring  our\r\n\r\ncountry to economic success and prosperity in this\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Honourable Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance,  in presenting his Budget  Estimates\r\n\r\nfor  1975, has clearly shown that he has done  his\r\n\r\nhomework   and   that   he   has   given   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration   to   every  possible   factor   or\r\n\r\ncircumstance   which   may   affect    Singapore's\r\n\r\nbudgetary  affairs. At a time when most  countries\r\n\r\nin   the   world,  apart  from  the  oil-producing\r\n\r\ncountries,  are  having economic convulsions,  the 1975  Budget Estimates prescribe a preventive dose\r\n\r\nof remedy against economic recession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the skilful management of our economy and with\r\n\r\nthe  cooperation of all concerned,  Singapore  has\r\n\r\ndone considerably better despite the fact that  we\r\n\r\nhave  neither  raw material nor energy  resources.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  major industrial nations of the  world\r\n\r\nare   expected  to  recover  from  their   present\r\n\r\neconomic   difficulties  in   the   near   future,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  outlook for the future  seems  rather\r\n\r\nbright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as the Minister himself has cautioned, there\r\n\r\nwill  be a time lapse before the economic recovery\r\n\r\nof  the industrial powers of the world can have an\r\n\r\neffect  on  Singapore's economy. Again,  something\r\n\r\nunforeseen  may  crop  up to  delay  the  expected\r\n\r\neconomic recovery or its effect on our economy. It\r\n\r\nis   reasonable,  in  the  circumstances,  not  to\r\n\r\nanticipate any such economic recovery before early\r\n\r\n1976  but to have our own plans of development  so\r\n\r\nas to maintain our economy at a steady pace in the\r\n\r\nmeantime.  If we were to do nothing  in  the  hope\r\n\r\nthat our own economy would surely benefit from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeneral  economic recovery of the world, we  might\r\n\r\nfind  that  our economy would have  lost  so  much\r\n\r\nmomentum as to be unable to take advantage of  any\r\n\r\nfuture economic boom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that respect, the development plans outlined\r\n\r\nby  the Minister, for giving a booster jab to  our\r\n\r\neconomy  and making available the funds  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose,  cannot be disputed. Just as it  is  said\r\n\r\nthat an ounce of prevention is better than a pound\r\n\r\nof   cure,   it  is  logical  now  to  channel   a\r\n\r\nsignificant proportion of our limited  funds  into\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects to prevent a slowdown of  our\r\n\r\neconomy rather than to squander later on far  more\r\n\r\nfunds  in  reactivating an economy that  has  been\r\n\r\nallowed to slow down significantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, however, comments to make on three\r\n\r\nmatters  which  have  been unsatisfactorily  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  or  completely omitted in the annual  Budget\r\n\r\nstatement  and  in  the  Revenue  and  Expenditure\r\n\r\nEstimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first matter relates to the establishment of\r\n\r\na  high-powered  body, such as the Road  Transport\r\n\r\nAction  Committee,  on which five  Ministries  are\r\n\r\nrepresented   by   their   respective    Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretaries and to the enactment of a statute such\r\n\r\nas  the  Road Traffic Act, portions of  which  are\r\n\r\nadministered   and  enforced  by   two   different\r\n\r\nMinistries.  Sir, I would like to  make  it  clear\r\n\r\nthat  I support the establishment of such a  high-powered body which is normally associated with one\r\n\r\nMinistry,   in  particular,  and   which   is   so\r\n\r\nconstituted  as to avoid bureaucratic red-tape  in\r\n\r\norder   to   resolve  the  traffic  nightmare.   I\r\n\r\nappreciate  that it is not practical  or  feasible\r\n\r\nfor  every  Ministry to enforce  by  itself  every\r\n\r\nstatute it has to administer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, any committee, even a high-powered\r\n\r\none,  and  any enactment, in the normal course  of\r\n\r\nits operation or implementation, may give rise  to\r\n\r\ngrievances which require to be resolved.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthe  grievances  may be petty or  groundless.  But\r\n\r\nthen  again,  some grievances may  be  genuine  as\r\n\r\nthere may be anomalies which have somehow been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noverlooked  by  the committee in its deliberations\r\n\r\nor  which  have  not been readily apparent  before\r\n\r\nimplementation of such an Act or a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that, to facilitate the\r\n\r\naccounting   by  the  executive  to  this   House,\r\n\r\nseparate  budgetary provisions  be  made  for  any\r\n\r\ncommittee   or  body  which  exists   beyond   the\r\n\r\njurisdiction  of  any particular Ministry  or  the\r\n\r\nportfolios of the different Ministries be  revised\r\n\r\nto provide for such committee or body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe   second  matter  relates  to  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nproposal to increase the road tax on petrol-driven\r\n\r\nprivate  vehicles. The apparent justification  for\r\n\r\nan   increase  in  this  particular  tax  is   the\r\n\r\nanticipated  fall  in revenue from  other  sources\r\n\r\ntaken in conjunction with the proposed increase in\r\n\r\nthe development expenditure. Then again, the brunt\r\n\r\nof  the  proposed road tax increase falls  on  the\r\n\r\nowners  of petrol-driven private vehicles  in  the\r\n\r\n1001-2000 cc range. The apparent justification is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the affected category of vehicles constitutes\r\n\r\nthe  bulk  of  private vehicles  on  the  road  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.    Any   tax   measure    that    would\r\n\r\nsignificantly help to keep down the number of cars\r\n\r\non  the  road would apparently help to  ease  road\r\n\r\ncongestion  in  Singapore.  In  that  sense,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  evidently intended  to  kill  two\r\n\r\nbirds with one stone, that is, raise funds and  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time relieve traffic congestion  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral Business District.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of road tax on petrol-driven private\r\n\r\nvehicles,  a  certain  amount  of  confusion   has\r\n\r\nresulted  from the proposal to impose the heaviest\r\n\r\ntax  increase  on  vehicles in  the  1001-2000  cc\r\n\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existing graduated scale of road tax, that is,\r\n\r\nbefore  3rd March, 1975 on petrol-driven  vehicles\r\n\r\nhas   presumably  been  drawn  up  to   discourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans    from    owning    vehicles    with\r\n\r\nunnecessarily large engines. Every drop of  petrol\r\n\r\nthat  is needlessly burned up merely adds  to  the\r\n\r\npollution of Singapore's atmosphere and  the  size\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's foreign exchange spending.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso  to  be  presumed that the justification  for\r\n\r\nthis  graduated scale of road tax continues to  be\r\n\r\nas  valid as ever. That is why I find it  hard  to\r\n\r\nsee any real need for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  re-adjustment of such scale in favour of owners\r\n\r\nof petrol-driven vehicles of over 2000 cc, because\r\n\r\nthe bigger the vehicle the greater the luxury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the third matter on which I\r\n\r\nwant   to  comment,  that  is,  the  question   of\r\n\r\npollution. Singapore, of course, is a small island\r\n\r\nwith  a  proportionately thin strip of territorial\r\n\r\nwater and tiny air space over which Singapore  can\r\n\r\nexercise  any  control in so far as anti-pollution\r\n\r\nmeasures   are   concerned.   The   pollution   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's seas by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Showa  Maru\"  disaster and the pollution  of  our\r\n\r\natmosphere   by   forest  fires  in   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries  show the extent to which  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nvulnerable to external events and circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But within these rather narrow limits Singapore\r\n\r\nshould and could provide all reasonable facilities\r\n\r\nand  measures to combat and control  any  form  of\r\n\r\npollution in Singapore. An illustration  in  point\r\n\r\nis  the  `formation  of a centralised  command  to\r\n\r\ncombat oil spill in and around Singapore waters  - mainly  the  Anti-sea Pollution Unit of  PSA  -  a\r\n\r\nmeasure  which  the  Government  deserves  to   be\r\n\r\ncongratulated. But such praise cannot be given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  in  relation  to  its  effort  in\r\n\r\ncontrolling other forms of pollution in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister in his annual Budget statement has\r\n\r\ncorrectly  dealt on the need for development.  But\r\n\r\nany  form  of development is bound to  affect  not\r\n\r\nonly  our  economy  but also our environment,  for\r\n\r\nbetter or for worse. If the effect is bad, as when\r\n\r\nit  results in some form of pollution, then it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  steps are  taken  to  prevent  or\r\n\r\nminimise  such  pollution. The  provision  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget for additional development does not seem to\r\n\r\nconsider  the  need for additional expenditure  on\r\n\r\nanti-pollution measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greater danger is posed by chemical\r\n\r\npollutants since their toxic effects are built  up\r\n\r\nslowly   in  human  tissue  and  are  not  readily\r\n\r\napparent at the beginning.\r\n\r\nBy  the  time  the full toxic effects of  chemical\r\n\r\npollutants  are felt, it may be too  late.  It  is\r\n\r\npointless to create jobs for our workers, only  to\r\n\r\nturn them into bed-ridden patients in later years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may also be appropriate for me to remark at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture  on the absence of  any  Government\r\n\r\naction  on the level of pollution emitted  by  SBS\r\n\r\nbuses, which is most annoying to other road users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective anti-pollution planning, however, may\r\n\r\nnecessitate the coordination of action by  two  or\r\n\r\nmore  Ministries. That brings me back to the first\r\n\r\nmatter  I  have commented upon. One  Ministry  may\r\n\r\nsponsor and administer a piece of legislation, but\r\n\r\nit  may  enforce that legislation only through  or\r\n\r\nwith  the  aid  of  another Ministry.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nproblem  which  has  not been dealt  with  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment up to now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this has been a rather long\r\n\r\nday   and  I  have  listened  very  carefully  and\r\n\r\npatiently to all the remarks which have been  made\r\n\r\nby all the Members who have spoken this afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to thank Members,\r\n\r\nalmost  all  I  think,  for  their  congratulatory\r\n\r\nremarks  upon both the performance of the  economy\r\n\r\nand  for the responsibility which my Ministry  has\r\n\r\nborne  in  regard to the results which  have  been\r\n\r\nachieved over the past year. I thank them also for\r\n\r\nthe  many  suggestions which have  been  made  for\r\n\r\nimprovements  either  in the  economy  or  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries and departments. I even  thank\r\n\r\nthem for the brick-bats which have been hurled  at\r\n\r\nme, because these critical remarks may be valuable\r\n\r\nin  dispelling  any  smugness or  self-complacency\r\n\r\nwhich   may   affect  Government  Ministries   and\r\n\r\ndepartments in the success which we have had  over\r\n\r\nthe  past few years. I think the slowing  down  of\r\n\r\nthe  growth  rate  may have been  to  some  extent\r\n\r\nsalutary in warning us that we cannot presume upon\r\n\r\nsuccess  all the time and that we need  constantly\r\n\r\nto  increase  our efforts to improve the  economy.\r\n\r\nThis smugness and complacency is felt not only  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil service, which has been singled out for\r\n\r\ncritical  mention here and to which I  will  refer\r\n\r\nlater, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  perhaps even in our own House, in the nation\r\n\r\nas  a whole, and in the way in which they seem  to\r\n\r\nregard  success  as being natural  and  likely  to\r\n\r\ncontinue.  I hope that this very false  impression\r\n\r\ncan  be  disabused of and that  there  will  be  a\r\n\r\ngreater  effort  to  try and  continue  growth  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  the very high rate  which  we  have\r\n\r\nexperienced in the past and to which I hope growth\r\n\r\nwould  return, if not this year, at least  in  the\r\n\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to deal with the comments of\r\n\r\nMembers.  Let  me first deal with the  problem  of\r\n\r\ntaxes  which has perhaps aroused most  emotion  in\r\n\r\nthe  House,  so that I can get it out of  the  way\r\n\r\nbefore making my comments on other criticisms.  It\r\n\r\nis  always very difficult to balance the needs for\r\n\r\nadditional  revenue  (and  these  needs  are  more\r\n\r\nevident  this  year  than last year)  against  the\r\n\r\nconcessions  which Members think should  be  given\r\n\r\nbecause   of   the  inflationary  or  recessionary\r\n\r\neffects  which  we  are experiencing  at  present.\r\n\r\nThese  recessionary and inflationary effects  have\r\n\r\ninfluenced  the  population and have,  of  course,\r\n\r\naffected  the  way in which matters  of  taxation,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  those I have introduced in  this  House,\r\n\r\nhave  been regarded. At the same time there  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat  need  for  recognition by all  citizens  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  of their responsibility of  paying  for\r\n\r\nsome  of the services, which are afforded  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and  which  cost  the  Government   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  amount  of  money,  which  must   be\r\n\r\nfinanced. I `have previously stated, as being  the\r\n\r\nopinion   of  some  international  experts,   that\r\n\r\nperhaps the burden of taxation is not being spread\r\n\r\nbroadly  enough  to bring home to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  the realisation that the Government  is\r\n\r\nthere  not  only to spread benefits  but  also  to\r\n\r\nprovide the means to pay for these services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the matter which raised most excitement\r\n\r\nwas  the  increase in road tax on cars. There  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  a  dissentient voice on the  taxes  for\r\n\r\ntobacco.  In fact, there was even one  Member  who\r\n\r\nwas  in favour of increasing the taxes on tobacco.\r\n\r\nThere  was  general support on the tax on  liquor,\r\n\r\nalthough one Member,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  thought  that  I  was  not  a  beer  drinker,\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  it was unfair generally  to  beer\r\n\r\ndrinkers   who  are  increasing  in   number   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  this  measure is `likely  to  affect  a\r\n\r\nmajor  part  of the population. May I assure  that\r\n\r\nMember  that I am also a beer drinker but I  would\r\n\r\nnot  grudge the extra that I have to pay  for  the\r\n\r\nbottle of beer that I consume. I hope that he  and\r\n\r\nmembers of the public will feel the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted that quite a number of Members have been\r\n\r\nsomewhat critical about the way in which  I  `have\r\n\r\nframed  the  increase in road  tax.  Some  Members\r\n\r\nthought that the emphasis was perhaps on the lower\r\n\r\nor  at  least the middle group of cars.  I  should\r\n\r\nexplain  that while it is true that the burden  of\r\n\r\nthis  particular taxation has been on the 1000  cc\r\n\r\nto  2000  cc  cars, that on these  the  burden  is\r\n\r\nheaviest,  when  you  look  at  the  whole  range,\r\n\r\nstarting  from  cars below 1000 cc to  those  over\r\n\r\n3000   cc,   the  burden  of  taxation  has   been\r\n\r\nrelatively  fair. Therefore, I would ask  them  to\r\n\r\nlook   at   the  whole  package  rather  than   on\r\n\r\nparticular  aspects of the package. I  have  noted\r\n\r\nthe  names of Members who spoke on this, but  they\r\n\r\nare  so numerous that I think there is no need for\r\n\r\nme  to repeat them here. But I have taken note  of\r\n\r\nthose Members who are particularly unhappy about a\r\n\r\nparticular part of the package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Members believe that the tax is not what I\r\n\r\nsaid,  i.e, that it does not affect matters  basic\r\n\r\nto  life  for  the  average  family.  The  general\r\n\r\nfeeling  is that the average family is  now  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to afford a car, perhaps even a  car  in\r\n\r\nthe 1000 cc to 2000 cc group. I am very happy that\r\n\r\nthis  is the general impression because it  really\r\n\r\nreflects  the growing affluence of our  community.\r\n\r\nIf it is true that it is no longer a luxury to own\r\n\r\na  car  but  a standard possession of the  average\r\n\r\nfamily in Singapore, then I think it is also  true\r\n\r\nthat  \"there  is  a  chicken  in  every  pot\"   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Maybe we have achieved this particular\r\n\r\nobjective.  I  doubt it myself, but after  hearing\r\n\r\nMembers  I  get that impression. After saying  all\r\n\r\nthis may I say that I am totally unrepentant about\r\n\r\nhaving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimposed this rather modest tax. I thought that the\r\n\r\nincrease  of  $60 per annum for the  1000  cc  and\r\n\r\nunder cars is very modest. Sixty dollars a year is\r\n\r\nmerely $5 a month. I am sure that anyone who  goes\r\n\r\nto  the  Orchard Road Car Park, Albert  Street  or\r\n\r\nBugis  Street area and does not spend $5  for  one\r\n\r\ngood  meal  with  his friends or  members  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily  would be rather unusual. So if it is  true\r\n\r\nthat  a  1000 cc car is now a standard possession,\r\n\r\nthen the $5 increase per month for that particular\r\n\r\npossession is a very reasonable price to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members thought that my objective of\r\n\r\nincreasing the road tax was to prevent  a  greater\r\n\r\nnumber of new cars getting on the road. That was a\r\n\r\nsecondary  objective. I did  not  put  forth  this\r\n\r\nobjective   as   the  reason  for  imposing   this\r\n\r\nparticular  tax. In fact, if Members had  read  my\r\n\r\nBudget statement carefully, I made it quite  clear\r\n\r\nthat  I  wanted  more revenue  and  this  was  one\r\n\r\nmethod.  The amount of tax for individual cars  is\r\n\r\nrather  small  - $5 a month - but collectively  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to  a respectable sum. In fact, I  did  not\r\n\r\nthink  that this is the solution to the congestion\r\n\r\nproblem  nor would this be the answer to making  a\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  the CBD scheme or the Park  and  Ride\r\n\r\nscheme. It is purely a psychological reminder that\r\n\r\nthese  schemes are coming, and that some influence\r\n\r\nshould  be exercised upon persons to try  and  use\r\n\r\nmore  public transport. In order to make a success\r\n\r\nof  the schemes which we are proposing, there  may\r\n\r\nbe  a  need  for  further tax  provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture. Therefore, I do not want Members to  think\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  the final round of tax,  and  that\r\n\r\nhaving  imposed this tax, this is the end  of  all\r\n\r\ntaxes as far as road transportation is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the tax concession which I made for\r\n\r\npeople  who work beyond the age of 55 or 60 years.\r\n\r\nI  think very few Members welcomed this particular\r\n\r\ntax concession. The Member for Potong Pasir was an\r\n\r\nexception.  But  most of the Members  thought  the\r\n\r\nrelief for workers over 50 was purely token.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cost of the tax concession is going\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  $4 million, and certainly no Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  would regard this as purely token.  If  I\r\n\r\ndid not consider it necessary that this should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  for  a very definite purpose, I  would  not\r\n\r\nhave agreed to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar was particularly\r\n\r\nironical about this particular tax concession.  He\r\n\r\nis  perhaps unusually suspicious, but that may  be\r\n\r\nthe result of his own environment and experiences.\r\n\r\nMaybe he has had a harder life than most of us and\r\n\r\nthat accounts for his rather jaundiced view. But I\r\n\r\nhope  he will live long enough to continue working\r\n\r\nuntil  well over 55 or well over 60 years so  that\r\n\r\nhe can enjoy this particular concession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other countries where people work\r\n\r\nover  55.  In  fact, the retirement  age  in  some\r\n\r\ncountries  is  65.  As to the suggestion  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  a  retirement age  of  60,  that  is\r\n\r\nalready  in  force  at least  for  new  Government\r\n\r\nservants. If there is a request by those who  were\r\n\r\nengaged before a certain date, and who are covered\r\n\r\nby safeguards under the Constitution, to opt for a\r\n\r\nnew  retirement age instead of 55 without  wanting\r\n\r\nto  keep  their safeguard, I think the  Government\r\n\r\nwould  be  most happy to consider an extension  of\r\n\r\ntheir retirement age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that there is or was until recently\r\n\r\na  manpower shortage and in giving this particular\r\n\r\nconcession  I  am hoping that we  will  soon  come\r\n\r\nagain to that happy position. In fact, we are  now\r\n\r\nissuing  work  permits  to  people  who  are  non-citizens,  which means that there is a demand  for\r\n\r\nadditional  labour.  We have  tried  to  encourage\r\n\r\ngreater   female  participation   from   our   own\r\n\r\npopulation with some success. But I am afraid that\r\n\r\nthe  possibilities of extending  this  beyond  the\r\n\r\npresent  position are not very good. In any  case,\r\n\r\nsome  of  our  women would be better  off  looking\r\n\r\nafter the children. We are trying our best to  try\r\n\r\nand  get  as  many people, who are not at  present\r\n\r\neconomically active, into employment. For example,\r\n\r\nI  think the employment of crippled or handicapped\r\n\r\npeople in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain jobs has been tried quite successfully  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government  service, and  there  is  all  the\r\n\r\nreason  in the world why people who are still  fit\r\n\r\nafter  55 or even after 60 years should be induced\r\n\r\nto carry on working for as long as possible. There\r\n\r\nwas  a  suggestion that employers are not prepared\r\n\r\nto  maintain employment for people who are over 55\r\n\r\nyears.  Of  course, this may be true in particular\r\n\r\ncases, but if those over 55 years have skills,  as\r\n\r\nwe hope they will increasingly acquire skills over\r\n\r\nthe  next  few  years, then they  will  be  valued\r\n\r\nemployees,  and I am sure employers will  want  to\r\n\r\nretain them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a possibility that the wages\r\n\r\nobtaining at 55 years would be higher than may  be\r\n\r\njustified by the skills; in which case, of course,\r\n\r\nthe  regard  for seniority will have  to  be  cast\r\n\r\naside  and  the employee over 55 or 60 years  must\r\n\r\nmerely get the rate for the job he is doing.  This\r\n\r\nalso happens in the Government service. There  are\r\n\r\nsome  people who get the rate for the job. In  the\r\n\r\npast  the  Government paid three-quarters  of  the\r\n\r\nsalary   for  people  who  came  back   into   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  service. In the last few  years  there\r\n\r\nhave  been others who have come back on full  pay.\r\n\r\nThis   is  obviously  what  they  are  worth  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they should receive the full pay  which\r\n\r\nthey deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In place of this relief for workers of over 55 or\r\n\r\n60 years I think there was a very impassioned plea\r\n\r\n- I am not quite sure which Member made it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  extending  reliefs for young  couples  rather\r\n\r\nthan  for  those over 55 years. There was  another\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that the relief which I am  giving  to\r\n\r\npeople  over 55 years should be extended  also  to\r\n\r\nall  workers  below that age.  It  is  simply  not\r\n\r\npossible for any Minister for Finance to  do  that\r\n\r\nbecause  it  really comes back to the question  of\r\n\r\nwhether  I  should give additional tax  relief  to\r\n\r\nevery  taxpayer.  I am afraid that  would  not  be\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few people who can avoid taxes.\r\n\r\nThere are two things we cannot avoid -- death  and\r\n\r\ntaxes!  At  least those who are in the comfortable\r\n\r\nclass of being able to come within the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Income Tax Ordinance  certainly\r\n\r\ncannot  escape, not even hawkers. There were  some\r\n\r\ncriticisms  to the effect that the Inland  Revenue\r\n\r\nDepartment  had  not  been taking  action  against\r\n\r\nhawkers.  The reason was that the return or  yield\r\n\r\nfrom action against hawkers was not adequate,  and\r\n\r\nin  some  cases we spent much more  than  what  we\r\n\r\ncollected.  I  think  I need not  have  to  assure\r\n\r\nMembers that where cases of flagrant violation  of\r\n\r\nincome  tax laws are brought to our notice we  are\r\n\r\nprepared to prosecute offenders to the full extent\r\n\r\nof  the  law even if it means that we will have  a\r\n\r\nnegative  return on our efforts. But last  year  I\r\n\r\nsuggested  that if Members knew of any  particular\r\n\r\nhawkers  who were making extraordinary amounts  of\r\n\r\nmoney they should bring them to our notice, and we\r\n\r\nwould be very happy to make the investigations and\r\n\r\nto  collect whatever was due to the Government and\r\n\r\nto the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of other suggestions for new\r\n\r\ntaxes, and I am very grateful to Members for  even\r\n\r\nthinking about them. Some of these are for capital\r\n\r\ngains  tax  (capital  gains in  the  stock  market\r\n\r\nperhaps) and increased taxes on companies. I  need\r\n\r\nonly  say  that  these are among  the  very  hardy\r\n\r\nperennial suggestions which have been made  to  us\r\n\r\nand  which  we have consistently rejected  because\r\n\r\nthey  are  against our ideas on  how  our  economy\r\n\r\nshould develop. If we really do want to have multi-nationals   and   to  have  them  manufacture   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and if we want to compete in  the  way\r\n\r\nthat  we  have done in the past, then these  ideas\r\n\r\nare not really feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one further variant of the suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  tax relief for workers over 55 years  should\r\n\r\nbe changed, and this is that the income tax relief\r\n\r\nfor parents or grandparents ought to be increased.\r\n\r\nThis  was  also  examined. I thought  that  having\r\n\r\nregard  to  the  fact that we were already  giving\r\n\r\n$750  relief per parent or grandparent living with\r\n\r\nthe  taxpayer, this was adequate. I see no  reason\r\n\r\nto  change my mind on this at the moment. I do not\r\n\r\nthink  there are any other ideas on taxation,  but\r\n\r\nif there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  I  will examine them when I have the time  to\r\n\r\nlook  over the very voluminous notes I have  taken\r\n\r\nthis evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the civil service. There were two\r\n\r\ncomments.  One  was by the Member for  Katong.  He\r\n\r\nmentioned that while in Fullerton Building he  saw\r\n\r\na number of civil servants sauntering and lounging\r\n\r\nand enjoying themselves. I would appreciate it  if\r\n\r\nhe   had  come  to  me  and  told  me  about  this\r\n\r\nparticular  department instead of just  mentioning\r\n\r\nit  here.  I hope, after the meeting here tonight,\r\n\r\nhe would do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley also dealt with the\r\n\r\nsubject which, I think, he originally spoke on  in\r\n\r\nthe debate on the President's speech. He mentioned\r\n\r\nthe  implementation process, the  difficulties  of\r\n\r\nthe  professional  and medical  services  and  the\r\n\r\nbureaucratic way in which matters were being dealt\r\n\r\nwith  in the Ministries, particularly the Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Finance  with  regard  to  the  authority  on\r\n\r\nexpenditure of funds, virements and so on.  It  is\r\n\r\nvery  easy for the civil service to be the  target\r\n\r\nwhether of Members here or of the people who write\r\n\r\nto  the  Press.  Civil servants are  prevented  by\r\n\r\nregulations  from making any reply themselves  and\r\n\r\nso, as the Minister in charge, perhaps I can in  a\r\n\r\nvery  small  way  reply  on  their  behalf.  I  am\r\n\r\ngrateful, of course, for any suggestion which  may\r\n\r\nbe made to improve civil service standards, and  I\r\n\r\nam   obliged   for  one  or  two  expressions   of\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  for  the  efficiency  of  our  civil\r\n\r\nservice  generally. I think there is  no  question\r\n\r\nthat,  at least in this particular region  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  our  civil  service is regarded  as  being\r\n\r\nperhaps as efficient, if not more efficient,  than\r\n\r\nthose  of other jurisdictions. I think members  of\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service are justified in being  a  bit\r\n\r\nproud  of  their  reputation  and  standing.  They\r\n\r\nshould not, of course, carry this pride into their\r\n\r\nrelations with the public, and I do not think they\r\n\r\ndo  except  for a few black sheep. I certainly  do\r\n\r\nnot accept the general truth of any criticisms  of\r\n\r\nthis  nature,  and  if there  are  any  particular\r\n\r\ninstances  I  hope  Members  will  not  just  make\r\n\r\ngeneral remarks but refer particular instances  to\r\n\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service is so constituted that there are\r\n\r\nvarious spheres of responsibility and those in the\r\n\r\nhigher levels of the service, of course, should be\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  matters of higher  administration\r\n\r\nand policy, while the administration generally  of\r\n\r\nrules  and regulations must remain with the  lower\r\n\r\nranks   of  the  civil  service.  This  is  really\r\n\r\nnecessary  as  a  measure of efficiency,  and  the\r\n\r\nproblems to he dealt with should be dealt with  at\r\n\r\nas  low  a  level  as possible.  Only  when  these\r\n\r\nproblems  are  not  capable of solution  at  these\r\n\r\nlower  levels should they be referred upwards.  So\r\n\r\nthe  problems  such  as those of  compliance  with\r\n\r\nfinancial regulations or authority for expenditure\r\n\r\nand so on are, in fact, devolved upon the clerical\r\n\r\nservice  and perhaps the executive service.  These\r\n\r\nofficers  ought  to  be  able  to  implement   the\r\n\r\nregulations and the people who submit requests for\r\n\r\nauthorisation ought to be able to deal  with  them\r\n\r\nwithout too much difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for River Valley also mentioned a few\r\n\r\ninstances  which  are  obviously  ridiculous.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  approval of  a  50-cycle  generator\r\n\r\naccompanied  by  the query that  there  should  be\r\n\r\njustification for the purchase of 50  bicycles  is\r\n\r\nrather  an  extreme case. In my own experience  of\r\n\r\nmatters which have come to me, I do not think that\r\n\r\nthere   are  many  instances  of  such  ridiculous\r\n\r\nrequests by the Budget Division of my Ministry. If\r\n\r\nthere were such examples, again I would like these\r\n\r\nto  be brought to my notice and perhaps those  who\r\n\r\nperpetrated  these blunders can  be  sent  to  our\r\n\r\nStaff Training Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also the comment that virements could\r\n\r\nnot  be  approved by the higher civil servants  of\r\n\r\nother   ministries.  I  do  not  think   that   is\r\n\r\nparticularly    true.    This    is    really    a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding or misconception.  Authority  for\r\n\r\ncertain  virements have already been delegated  to\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretaries  of  other  ministries  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  really no need to refer  any  of  these\r\n\r\nvirements to us. However, there are certain  other\r\n\r\ntypes of vire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nments  which  require approval from the  Treasury,\r\n\r\nbecause  they are subject to Treasury sanction  or\r\n\r\nto   certain   regulations  which  prevent,   say,\r\n\r\nexpenditure on manpower being vired to  a  special\r\n\r\nexpenditure. These requirements are, I think, only\r\n\r\nto   be  expected.  Nevertheless,  I  welcome  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion of the Member for River Valley that the\r\n\r\nEstimates Committee should try and improve on  our\r\n\r\nmethods  and procedures, and I will be very  happy\r\n\r\nto  receive  suggestions from  the  House  or  the\r\n\r\nEstimates Committee on how our procedures  can  be\r\n\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make one formal comment in regard\r\n\r\nto  the  civil service, and this is  a  matter  on\r\n\r\nwhich I thought Members would have expressed  some\r\n\r\nappreciation. This is on the presentation  of  the\r\n\r\nBudget.  But the only comment I had has  been,  in\r\n\r\nfact, an adverse comment - that we have classified\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates  so  that  we  now  can  tell  what\r\n\r\nappropriations  are  made  for  various   economic\r\n\r\npurposes,  but the emphasis should  really  be  on\r\n\r\nperformance  rather than on cost. I ought  to  say\r\n\r\nthat performance budgetting is one other aspect of\r\n\r\nbudgetting  procedures  which  we  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nimprove.  But  in view of the work which  we  were\r\n\r\nalready doing on the manner of presentation of the\r\n\r\nBudget,  we thought that that should have priority\r\n\r\nbefore  we went into the new method of performance\r\n\r\nbudgetting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I would like to deal with the matter of\r\n\r\ntourism. A number of Members in this House thought\r\n\r\nthat the natural advantages of Singapore would  be\r\n\r\nsufficient to attract tourists without our  having\r\n\r\nto  spend  any  money  on  the  Singapore  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board. This was, in fact, the policy  we\r\n\r\nadopted  in  the early years of the 1960s  -  that\r\n\r\ntourism was not important and that if the tourists\r\n\r\nwanted   to   come  to  Singapore,   the   natural\r\n\r\nadvantages  would be such that there was  no  need\r\n\r\nfor  further promotion. I think we have  abandoned\r\n\r\nthat  particular  practice or policy.  We  decided\r\n\r\nthat  certainly in the years when the British were\r\n\r\nhaving  a  military rundown from  their  Singapore\r\n\r\nbases the earnings from tourism would be very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelpful  in  improving the balance of payments  by\r\n\r\nearning foreign exchange for Singapore. And I  see\r\n\r\nno  particular reason why we should depart from  a\r\n\r\npolicy  which  has  paid such dividends  over  the\r\n\r\n`last few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a further comment that the Singapore\r\n\r\nTourist Promotion Board had not been paying enough\r\n\r\nattention  to,  or that some of the revenue  which\r\n\r\nthey obtained from cess on tourist establishments,\r\n\r\nrestaurants  and so on, could be used  to  finance\r\n\r\nthe  arts or culture. The Tourist Promotion Board,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  has  spent  money  in  sending  troupes\r\n\r\noverseas for cultural shows. Perhaps this  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  very  best way in which funds of the  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board can be applied because much of the\r\n\r\nmoney that is being used has gone into the payment\r\n\r\nof fares for the people who travel overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tourist Promotion Board has also started a\r\n\r\nproject  to  promote arts and craft in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be a centre for arts and craft  which\r\n\r\nwill  be near the Board's offices in Orchard Road.\r\n\r\nI  think a very considerable amount of money  will\r\n\r\nbe spent on this arts and craft centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the comment by the Member for Jalan\r\n\r\nKayu  that  the  report of the  Tourist  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard  has  not  been produced as  rapidly  as  it\r\n\r\nshould  be.  I have pressed the Singapore  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board  to  produce their  reports  more\r\n\r\nexpeditiously. And the reason why  they  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  do  this is that there  have  been\r\n\r\nconsiderable movements of staff which  have  meant\r\n\r\nthat the people responsible for these reports  had\r\n\r\nunfortunately not been able to complete their work\r\n\r\nbefore leaving the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the comment by the Member for Bukit Ho\r\n\r\nSwee  that tourists were being fleeced.  This  and\r\n\r\nother defects are all, I think, being remedied and\r\n\r\nI  hope  that  the  situation will  be  much  more\r\n\r\nsatisfactory in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu thought that in view of\r\n\r\nthe  contribution which tourism has  made  to  our\r\n\r\neconomic development the increases in costs which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been  imposed upon the hotels and  upon  the\r\n\r\ntourist   industry  generally  have  been   rather\r\n\r\nadverse  in their effects. Unfortunately,  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  greater  cost of oil, electricity  and  other\r\n\r\ncosts, like increases in wages and so on, have  to\r\n\r\nbe  recovered. I do not think there is any  remedy\r\n\r\nfor  this.  Our  only consolation  is  that  these\r\n\r\nhigher  costs also affect our competitors  in  the\r\n\r\ntourism industry, and therefore we should be  able\r\n\r\nto maintain our competitive edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the matters on which I have some\r\n\r\nresponsibility. There were other matters raised by\r\n\r\nMembers  but they really concern other  Ministries\r\n\r\nand might perhaps better be raised when the debate\r\n\r\non the Estimates takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like, however, to comment on the\r\n\r\nrepresentations  of  the Member  for  Jurong,  who\r\n\r\ngenerally  at  this  time of the  year  speaks  on\r\n\r\nagriculture  and of my neglect of this  particular\r\n\r\nsector of the economy. I think I have responded at\r\n\r\nsome  length  in  previous Budget debates.  But  I\r\n\r\nalways  listen  to  the  Member  for  Jurong  with\r\n\r\nsympathy  because my early years were spent  on  a\r\n\r\nfarm.  I was born on a farm. In my early years  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service, I think I was regarded  as  a\r\n\r\nfairly competent land officer; at least I hope so!\r\n\r\nI  am  quite  aware  of  the problems  of  farmers\r\n\r\n-having served in the Land Office from 1939  until\r\n\r\n1959, at least when I ended up as Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nLands.  So  I  may  be  said  to  have  had   some\r\n\r\nexperience of the problems relating to farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately with the development of the economy\r\n\r\nin Singapore, the amount of land that will be left\r\n\r\nfor agriculture will be very limited, and there is\r\n\r\nno redress that I can see. There is no possibility\r\n\r\nthat  we  can find enough land for all the farming\r\n\r\ndesired.  All of us, I think, are in some respects\r\n\r\nfarmers at heart. We like to own a piece of  land.\r\n\r\nWe  like  to see things growing but we all  cannot\r\n\r\nfulfil our ambition to be farmers. Nevertheless, I\r\n\r\nam  filled  with  admiration by  the  achievement,\r\n\r\nunder  very  great difficulties of our farmers  in\r\n\r\nmaking  us  self-sufficient in pigs,  poultry  and\r\n\r\neggs, in supplying so much of our table vegetables\r\n\r\nand in many other ways. As I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsay,  I  cannot, as Minister for Finance, see  any\r\n\r\nway  in  which  we  can  increase  the  supply  of\r\n\r\nagricultural land and I am afraid that we may have\r\n\r\nto  look  to other areas for the supply  of  these\r\n\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the kind of farming which is possible in the\r\n\r\nfuture,  I think what we are trying to  do  is  to\r\n\r\nfinance the industrial type of farming - the  very\r\n\r\ncapital-intensive type of pig and poultry  farming\r\n\r\nwhich is really a kind of industry rather than the\r\n\r\nold type of farming which we are accustomed to  in\r\n\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point which was made - the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  timber  and the  warning  which  the\r\n\r\nMembers for Katong and Sembawang gave against  the\r\n\r\nreputation for the quality of our timber  industry\r\n\r\nbeing    spoilt   by   exporters    with    rather\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  practices.  I  will   take   their\r\n\r\nsuggestions into consideration and hope  that  our\r\n\r\nTimber  Industry  Board can  remedy  the  mistakes\r\n\r\nwhich have been pointed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that there was general support for the\r\n\r\neducation  and  manpower training which  we  shall\r\n\r\nhave  to  maintain  or initiate  so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nimprove  the skills of our workers and  prevent  a\r\n\r\nbrain  drain overseas. I am conscious of the  need\r\n\r\nto  provide sufficient opportunities for  our  own\r\n\r\npeople  in the kind of industries which will  make\r\n\r\nthe fullest use of these skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were other matters mentioned by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Aljunied,  such as the Road Transport  Action\r\n\r\nCommittee   and  pollution  measures.  These   are\r\n\r\nmatters  not  really within my competence,  and  I\r\n\r\nhope  he  will  raise  them  with  the  particular\r\n\r\nMinister in charge of these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to comment on the need\r\n\r\nwhich  one  or  two  Members  have  expressed  for\r\n\r\ntripartite  cooperation  in  connection  with  the\r\n\r\nNational    Wages   Council   and   the   National\r\n\r\nProductivity Board. The need for such cooperation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  the reason why, in my Budget statement and  in\r\n\r\nthis  particular reply, I do not propose to  offer\r\n\r\nany  suggestions  or guidelines for  the  National\r\n\r\nWages Council, as was suggested by one Member.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  presumptuous of me to provide  what  is\r\n\r\nreally within the functions of a tripartite  body.\r\n\r\nI  agree entirely with Members that cooperation of\r\n\r\nthis kind is very desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the points\r\n\r\nraised.

I\r\n\r\nrefer to the two matters which I had touched  upon\r\n\r\nregarding  our Minister for Finance  as  a  senior\r\n\r\nofficer  during  the colonial time  and  that  the\r\n\r\nbudget  formulated  by  him  was  slanted  towards\r\n\r\nsupporting the capitalists.

The Mobile Squad is relatively better staffed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registrar of Vehicles Department has also its own Mobile Squad for enforcement work. On 1st March, 1975, the ROV Mobile Squad had 42 officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time better work methods have been introduced. In October 1974 a radio communications system was introduced. Through this system Mobile Squad patrolmen can maintain radio contact with their Headquarters. This in turn enables the Headquarters to deploy Mobile Squad patrolmen promptly to deal with traffic situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, two new pursuit cars have been added to the existing fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st March, 1975, the Ticketing System and Points Demerit System were introducted.\r\n\r\nUnder the Ticketing System a Mobile Squad Officer can issue a traffic ticket, which has\r\n\r\nthe effect of a court summons, to an offending motorist on the spot for a compoundable\r\n\r\ntraffic offence for which only the driver is liable. This has cut down time which a Mobile \r\n\r\nSquad Officer had to spend previously in reporting a traffic offender.  The Road Traffic Act has\r\n\r\nalso been amended to enable the Police to tender in court, as prima facie evidence, a certificate\r\n\r\nsigned by a competent police officer certifying the accuracy and reliability of policy equipment\r\n\r\nused in speeding cases.  Hence, there is no need for the whole team of seven squad officers\r\n\r\nto testify in court in speeding cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Points Demerit System is aimed at identifying and removing dangerous drivers\r\n\r\nfrom the road.  This System should make motorists drive more carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these changes the manpower requirements for the entire Traffice Division\r\n\r\nis being re-examined.  My Ministry has set up a Manpower Review Committee to reassess the\r\n\r\nmanpower situation for the whole Police Force.  It is premature to say whether the\r\n\r\nstrength of the Mobile Squad would be increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>STAFF TRAINING INSTITUTE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.
