FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>The President (Mr S R Nathan):</B> Honourable Members, we open the Second Session of this 10th Parliament with a heavy heart. Only two weeks ago, many parts of our region were devastated by tsunamis which brought death and destruction to entire communities. Some Singaporean lives were lost; others are still missing. Last Sunday, we held a Memorial Service for all the victims of this <p align=left>Column: 10</p> great calamity. In solidarity with other affected countries, we will do our part in the international efforts at rehabilitation and reconstruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nAt the Opening of the First Session of this 10th Parliament on 25th March 2002, I spoke of the need to re-make Singapore. I said that before the next elections in 2007, the core members of the new political leadership had to establish themselves and take Singapore another step forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nOn 12th August last year, a new Prime Minister and his Cabinet were sworn in. This team will build on the achievements of their predecessor, and develop new programmes to meet the challenges ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>SINGAPORE\u2019S ASSETS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the hard work of Singaporeans, the application of sound government policies, and the dedication of capable leaders at all levels, Singapore has enjoyed four decades of stability and progress. We have built a modern economy, a prosperous and equitable society, and a cohesive multi-racial, multi-religious nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n Today, we have sound and tested systems and institutions in all three branches of government and many sectors of society. We have a growing pool of talent, local and foreign, and a well-trained, disciplined workforce that is ready to adapt to changes. We are a cohesive community committed to preserving social harmony and building our home here. We are open to people from around the world who can contribute to our development and growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nInternationally, we have deep and wide networks with the global community and economy. We may be small, but our economic and international space is big.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n\r\n <p align=left>Column: 11</p> Most importantly, our people have been tested in crises like SARS and the threat of terrorism. We have come through stronger and more united, with a new generation of able and committed leaders who care for the well-being of Singapore and who have the will to serve the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nWe are therefore far better off today than we were at independence in 1965. We have every reason to go forward with confidence, despite the significant challenges ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>THE WAY FORWARD</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nA key ingredient of our success has been our faith in Singapore. Here we can pursue our dreams. Here everyone can hope for a better life. Our way forward is to continue making Singapore a land of opportunity for our people, so that this will long be the place where talent, energy and vitality congregate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nIn the next phase of our journey, I see the following as the key priorities of the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Securing our Place in the World</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nFirst, we must secure Singapore\u2019s place in the world, and nurture our relations with other countries. To thrive Singapore depends on the world around us. Geographically we may be an island, but in every other respect we are closely linked to the rest of the world. We need to live at peace with our neighbours, work with them for our common good, and play our part in the comity of nations. Our outlook should be cosmopolitan and international, welcoming trade, talent, ideas and enterprises from all over the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nOur closest ties are with our ASEAN neighbours. If they prosper, we too will gain. If they run into trouble, we will \r\n <p align=left>Column: 12</p> surely share their problems. In a fast changing world ASEAN countries have to put aside differences to cooperate with one another. Only then can we successfully tackle regional problems together. Only then can ASEAN hold its own against other regions in the global economic competition. Hence the Government places great importance on good relations with our ASEAN partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n At the same time, we will cultivate our ties with China and India. Their transformation will continue to fuel growth in the whole of Asia. We will also cultivate ties with the developed countries on which we depend for investments and markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n In an increasingly interdependent world, Singapore will fulfil its responsibilities as a global citizen. We will work with the United Nations, international organisations and their member countries on issues which concern us all, such as the environment, counter-terrorism, avian influenza, and free trade. We will share our experiences dealing with these issues. We will participate actively in international efforts, for example, in disaster relief, within the limits of our resources and capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nIn the aftermath of the recent earthquake and tsunamis, Singapore has contributed helicopters, ships, supplies, DART (Disaster Assistance and Rescue Teams) and medical and forensic teams to the relief efforts. Individual citizens have contributed open-heartedly, together donating more than $30 million so far. In this calamity, our citizens have responded with a generous spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Security as the Bedrock</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nSecond, we must build a safe and secure environment, to provide a firm foundation for achieving all our other aspirations. Without peace and security, <p align=left>Column: 13</p>  our economy and society will not sustain continued orderly development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nTransnational terrorism is the most immediate threat to our national security. Rooted in a fanatical ideology that employs extreme methods of terror, transnational terrorism is a long-term threat that requires a sustained and coordinated response. To deal with the threat, we must strengthen our Total Defence. All agencies of the government must be alert and work closely together, so as to leave no gaps in our defences. The people too must play their part, to cooperate with the government and strengthen our social cohesion. We must never allow the terrorists to exploit fault lines in our society, and thus divide and destroy us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nAt the same time, a strong SAF remains a priority. The SAF provides us with a credible deterrence and effective defence. The SAF is effective, because of our collective determination to fight to protect ourselves, our families and our homes when we are endangered. The dedication and sacrifices of generations of national servicemen demonstrate that despite many years of peace, this resolve remains unshaken. The SAF will maintain a high level of operational readiness as it modernises and transforms into the 3rd Generation SAF. In a quiet and non-provocative way, it will continue contributing to Singapore\u2019s security as well aspeace in Southeast Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Building the Economy</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThird, we must strengthen our economy. A thriving economy will provide us the resources to tackle all other challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nDespite the tsunamis, the overall outlook for Asia, and for our economy, is positive. Provided we continue to revise and update our economic strategies, we  <p align=left>Column: 14</p> can ride on Asia\u2019s rapid growth, move up the value chain, and keep on creating new opportunities for ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nWe will maintain a pro-business strategy, so that the private sector, both large and small firms, can prosper, and generate wealth and jobs. By supporting entrepreneurship and fostering innovation, we will encourage more people to dream of new ideas, pursue them with passion, and open up new opportunities for our economy. At the same time, by keeping regulation light, taxes low and the government trim, we will stimulate individual initiative and spur new businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nIn manufacturing, we will strengthen our existing industries in electronics, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and engineering. We will exploit promising technologies like biotechnology, new materials, photonics and nanotechnology to enhance our industry clusters or develop new growth areas. We will also foster the growth of new, vibrant services, like financial services, professional services, environment engineering, creative industries, education and tourism. The government will support these activities by investing in science and technology, research and development, and skilled manpower and talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Investing In People</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nFourth, we will invest in our people through better education for our young, timely and relevant training for our workforce, and job restructuring for our older workers. In education, we are already making extensive changes to offer different paths to success through a wider spectrum of learning. Our aim is to develop the potential of every student, be it in sports, the arts, music, humanities, science and technology or the professions. We will expand opportunities for students and teachers, to imbue them  <p align=left>Column: 15</p> with a zest for life-long learning and the nurturing of the human spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nWe will train our workers to be world class in their productivity, skill-levels, and competence; not just individually, but as a Singapore team. We will improve their skills as well as their creativity and resourcefulness. Ours must always be a work force that is proud of its capabilities and excels in its work. We will ensure that businesses can get the skilled manpower and talent that they need, in order to grow and create more jobs for our people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThe Government will work with the unions and employers, to help workers who are affected by restructuring to acquire new skills so as to remain employable. We will also focus on the problems faced by older workers. We must enable more Singaporeans to continue working into their 60s, and take advantage of new avenues of employment. Then they can stay active longer, retire later and provide better for their old age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Augmenting Our Population and Talent</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n Fifth, we will encourage Singaporeans to balance economic pursuits with fulfilment in personal goals and family life. Singapore should be a great place for families, for citizens as well as permanent residents and others who live and work here. We will persevere in our efforts to shift social attitudes towards marriage and parenthood. Singaporeans should not only want to develop their careers successfully, but also to form and bring up families, create caring homes and develop deep social bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nBy drawing in talent from all over the world, we will not only augment our population and build a more vibrant society, but also develop the economic strengths and competitive advantages so  <p align=left>Column: 16</p> necessary for success. This means keeping our doors open to foreigners with diverse skills, talents and aptitudes, and welcoming them warmly into our midst. We will encourage those who embrace our values and way of life to sink roots here as permanent residents and citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Engaging Our Youth</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nSixth, we need to engage and inspire a new generation of Singaporeans to build on what we have achieved, and to commit themselves to our enterprise. Our future lies in the hands of the post-independence generation. They will be our future leaders in government, business, social work, arts, sports and other fields. Our young must have the passion and commitment to act on their convictions and ideals. They have to benefit from the experiences of their elders, make the most of the plentiful opportunities, and keep our society fresh, vibrant, and forward looking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nWe will open more avenues for our young to be involved in national and community issues, and promote more activities that strengthen their sense of ownership and belonging. The government will help our youth translate ideas into constructive action. We will provide seed funding and support to help them get started, form new groups and link up with more established groups. This will create more opportunities for them to develop leadership and life skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nWe will also continue to offer overseas opportunities for young Singaporeans to become active and caring global citizens. In the aftermath of the tsunami disaster, young Singaporeans- through the Youth Expedition Project and other programmes- are playing a role in the rebuilding efforts of the affected countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nThere will however be some young Singaporeans who need help to realise  <p align=left>Column: 17</p> their potential. We will develop preventive and reintegration programmes for out-of-school youth, ex-youth offenders and other young people who need our assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>A Place for Everyone</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nFinally, we must ensure that all Singaporeans benefit from our success as a nation. Whilst we compete against one another to motivate each person to do his best, we must also work alongside one another to build this nation together. Therefore, no group should miss out on the fruits of our progress. Everyone who strives and contributes should get what he merits. We will equip all those who are willing to improve themselves with skills to make them useful and employable. We must help to uplift children from lower income families and others less well endowed, so that they can succeed in school and in their careers, and so break the cycle of poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nAffordable healthcare is a major concern of Singaporeans. Our 3M framework of Medisave, MediShield and Medifund is sound. It has provided Singaporeans with high quality medical care. We will improve this scheme to strengthen MediShield and the role of catastrophic medical insurance. This will lighten the financial burden on the minority of families who incur large hospital bills, and ease the worry of many others.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How Singapore treats and takes care of disabled persons reflects the kind of society we want to be. Our \"many helping hands\" approach has built up a broad range of support services for the disabled. We will continue to address their needs, and progressively enhance support for disabled children, to equip them for life and integrate them into society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n <p align=left>Column: 18</p> Older Singaporeans helped to build today\u2019s Singapore. Their contributions are still vital to our economy, and their experiences and values remain crucial to our society. We will value and honour them. We will support the social, mental, and physical needs of the growing numbers of older Singaporeans. Society and their families must engage them, care for them, and help them feel valued even after they retire. Together, we will make Singapore a great place for family life, and for living in harmony in our multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-religious community.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>CONCLUSION</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\nWe will achieve all this and more, if all of us join hands to work for what we believe in. The people are entitled to demand the best from their leaders. They also aspire to play a part, and expect to do so. Everyone who makes Singapore home will have opportunities to make a difference. Every contribution is valued and important. There will be unforeseen challenges, but so long as we stay united we will overcome them.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our forefathers came to Singapore because they saw opportunity here. Singapore represented hope, and promised a better life for themselves and their children. For the next generation, Singapore should continue to be a land of opportunity- opportunity for all Singaporeans to be the best that they can be, to lead fulfilling lives, and to contribute as citizens to a better Singapore. Let us build such a nation together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\">Adjourned according at Six</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"right\">Minutes to Nine o'clock pm.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF HEALTH-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)--><p align=left>Column: 19</p> \r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>ADDENDA TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF<br>\r\nTHE SECOND SESSION OF THE TENTH PARLIAMENT<br>\r\nON WEDNESDAY, 12TH JANUARY 2005</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><B>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">MR KHAW BOON WAN<br>\r\nMinister for Health</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 The Ministry of Health aims to ensure that good and affordable healthcare, appropriate to needs, is available to all Singaporeans, in addition to protecting public health. New challenges, including emerging diseases and rising lifestyle illnesses, demand fresh and bold ways for delivering and financing healthcare. The Ministry will pursue its objectives in collaboration with all healthcare partners. We will focus on the following initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>STRETCHING THE HEALTHCARE DOLLAR</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n2 The affordability of healthcare is a major concern for Singaporeans.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Strengthening the 3M Framework</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3 The Ministry will strengthen our 3M (Medisave, MediShield and Medifund) framework to help Singaporeans pay for their share of hospital bills after Government subsidy. In particular, the Ministry is reviewing MediShield and the role of insurance in paying for healthcare costs. This will relieve Singaporeans from the financial burden of large hospital bills.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 4 Medifund provides a safety net to help Singaporeans who are unable to pay for their medical expenses despite heavy subsidies, Medisave and MediShield. Its capital sum has been steadily built up to $1 billion. We will periodically top it up when conditions permit, so that Medifund remains adequate for our needs.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Managing Medical Inflation</I><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 5 New scientific advances are improving medical care but driving costs up. The Ministry will help contain medical inflation without compromising the quality of patient care. We will use market forces, where appropriate, to manage medical costs, for example through publishing bill sizes and quality indicators. This will allow Singaporeans to make informed choices on where to seek treatment and provide transparent benchmarks on the comparative efficiency of healthcare providers.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 6 Our public healthcare providers will review and standardise clinical practices. They will raise labour productivity and streamline operational processes to eliminate waste, such as cutting down unnecessary visits and tests. Patients, on their part, will need to moderate their expectations as there are limits to improving standards without cost increase.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Means Testing</I><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 7 Currently, the Ministry subsidises large portions of Singaporeans\u2019 hospitalisation bills, especially for B2/C patients. To better target our subsidy dollar for those in greatest  <p align=left>Column: 21</p> need, we will implement simple means testing for inpatient services, while ensuring that all Singaporeans will be able to access and afford healthcare if they need it.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>DEVELOPING A PATIENT-CENTRIC HEALTHCARE SYSTEM</B><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 8 Healthcare must be centred around the patient. This ensures the most appropriate care for the patient, and helps contain healthcare costs.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Building a Healthy Population</I><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 9 The first priority is to ensure that Singaporeans stay healthy, thus avoiding costly treatment. The Ministry will intensify its national programmes to prevent diseases, and to educate and encourage Singaporeans to take personal responsibility for their own health \u2013 to eat wisely, exercise regularly, manage stress, maintain good public and personal hygiene, and not smoke.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Managing Patients Holistically<br>\r\n</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p> 10The Ministry will promote the holistic management of patients instead of episodic illness care, through early detection, intervention and proper control of risk factors for chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 11 Primary care providers play a crucial role in this effort. Our GPs and polyclinics must serve as the first point-of-contact and be the main gatekeepers to ensure proper and right-siting of care. The Ministry will, through improved training, build up their capabilities to more effectively manage chronic diseases, including diabetes, obesity and asthma. Singaporeans benefit when they have good family physicians who help them actively manage their own health.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 12 The involvement and integration of other healthcare providers in the community, including nursing homes and community hospitals, are key to the right-siting of care and the holistic management of patients. The Ministry is launching Jurong HealthConnect, a community-based healthcare delivery model in Jurong. We are also planning a new hospital in Yishun to be the central node for a comprehensive and user-friendly health ecosystem in the north.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>IT- A Key Enabler</I><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 13Information Technology (IT) will be a key enabler. The Ministry will accelerate IT adoption to integrate our various healthcare providers through the seamless flow of information. This will improve efficiency, co-ordination and care delivery.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Towards Medical Excellence</I><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 14 Beyond IT and systems integration, striving for medical excellence and safeguarding medical standards remain fundamental to the success of any healthcare system. The Ministry will develop its healthcare manpower, ensuring that training is up to date, while increasing the supply and quality of medical and paramedical talent from local and foreign sources.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><p align=left>Column: 23</p>  15To raise the supply of talent, the Ministry will work with the National University of Singapore to start a second medical school. We will further free up the recognition of medical degrees from established foreign universities.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 16 Nurses can play a larger professional role. The Ministry is transforming the nursing profession, through job re-design, local nursing degree programmes, and expanded responsibilities for nurses with higher qualifications. We will continue to recruit foreign nurses to meet local shortages. For those who are deserving, we will grant accelerated PR status or citizenship.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 17The Ministry will also develop our clinical capabilities and improve the quality of patient care. Through our Health Services Development Programme, we will continue to pilot new health services and medical capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>TACKLING INFECTIOUS DISEASE OUTBREAKS<br>\r\n</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p> 18SARS highlighted the dangers of infectious diseases. Our success in dealing with the outbreak reflected the resilience of our public health system. The Ministry will stay vigilant to respond to infectious disease outbreaks, even as we formulate new measures to control the rise in communicable diseases like HIV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 19While HIV has not struck our population in a big way, the number of new cases has steadily risen. At present, the infection is mainly confined to small groups of individuals who engage in high-risk behaviour. We must not allow these individuals to infect their spouses, children or others. The Ministry will strengthen its prevention and control efforts, to ensure that HIV does not become a major public health problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>SINGAPORE MEDICINE<br>\r\n</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p> 20With rising demand for quality healthcare across the region, and given our reputation, there is significant potential for Singapore to be a medical hub. Through SingaporeMedicine, we will partner EDB, IES and STB to realise this economic potential.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT--><p align=left>Column: 23</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">MR MAH BOW TAN<br>\r\nMinister for National Development</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 MND will contribute to making Singapore a land of opportunity. We will enhance Singapore\u2019s position as an exciting, attractive and modern metropolis, a hub for talent and enterprise, and a home for our people. We will guide Singapore\u2019s continued development as a city of distinction, characterised by its architectural and urban design excellence and a high quality living environment. We will continue to ensure affordable quality public housing to meet the diverse needs of our people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>AN EXCITING, ATTRACTIVE AND MODERN METROPOLIS<br>\r\n</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p> 2 Our land use policies and development efforts will be geared towards making Singapore an attractive destination for businesses and new investments. We will adopt a pro-business approach and ensure flexibility in land use to accommodate changing trends and new needs. Besides the timely release of land for businesses, we will introduce new  <p align=left>Column: 25</p> land sale mechanisms to facilitate innovative and exciting concepts that create value. Shorter leases and other measures to reduce upfront land costs for businesses will also be explored.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 3 Downtown at Marina Bay will be a key focus of our development efforts. The development of the Business and Financial Centre, along with the redevelopment of the existing Central Business District, will enhance Singapore\u2019s position as a business and financial hub. The development of the waterfront promenade and the connecting bridge to Marina Centre will create a vibrant and exciting continuous loop of recreational and lifestyle activities around the Marina Bay.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 4 The rejuvenation of Orchard Road will ensure it retains its status as a premier shopping district. We will review our development guidelines for the area and encourage property owners to upgrade and enhance their properties.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 5 We will promote architectural and urban design excellence. A distinctive city, where a quality built environment is the hallmark, will enable Singapore to distinguish itself from other cities.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>A HIGH QUALITY LIVING ENVIRONMENT</B><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 6 MND will continue to ensure a high quality living environment for our residents. We have a well-deserved reputation as a premier Garden City, appreciated by visitors and residents alike. We will establish a second national botanical gardens at the Downtown at Marina Bay. A showcase of horticultural displays, it will feature an iconic conservatory of cool tropical as well as temperate plants. We will also organise a world-class biennial horticultural show at the new botanical gardens.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 7 We will continue to expand and upgrade the network of parks and park connectors. Together with our corporate and community partners we will upgrade and build new recreational facilities and attractions, and promote activities and edutainment programmes in the parks. We will also encourage local communities to participate in the management of the gardens in order to foster a greater sense of belonging and care for the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8 We will review and strengthen the code and regulatory framework for building and construction, to ensure that our buildings are of good quality, safe and elder-friendly. In particular, with an ageing population, MND will work closely with other agencies to ensure that the accessibility in and between buildings and public areas will be barrier-free as far as possible.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 9 Despite our high dependency on food imports, Singapore is a paradise for food lovers with the wide variety and quality of food available. MND will continue to strengthen our food safety management regime by improving our testing capabilities for food-borne hazards. We will work with major traders and diversify our food sources to ensure resilience in the food supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>AFFORDABLE QUALITY PUBLIC HOUSING</B><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 10 Public housing has played a critical role in promoting rootedness and social cohesion among Singaporeans. It has given our people a tangible stake in the country and facilitated upward social mobility.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <p align=left>Column: 27</p>  11 MND will continue to provide affordable and quality public housing that meets the needs and aspirations of Singaporeans. We will continue to promote home ownership for the vast majority who can afford it. The Government will gradually liberalise the public housing market to promote greater private sector participation in the design and development of public housing. This will give greater housing choice and variety for flat buyers. Subsidised rental housing will be provided for the needy who cannot afford home ownership flats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 12 MND will free up rules and regulations on public housing to encourage HDB lessees to be more self-reliant, responsible and entrepreneurial. We will give HDB residents more opportunities to participate in the management of their estates to foster greater ownership and a sense of belonging.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 13 Rejuvenation of our older HDB towns and estates will continue, through upgrading programmes and the Selective En-Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), within the resources available. In view of our rapidly ageing population, we will step up the pace of lift upgrading in HDB estates.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND WATER RESOURCES--><p align=left>Column: 27</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Assoc.

Our clean and high quality living environment has been cited as one of the key features visitors and investors appreciate most about Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 2 Our challenge ahead will be to sustain and enhance our clean and healthy environment, to ensure a safe and secure supply of water for all in Singapore, and to create in the community a sense of ownership and enjoyment of our environmental resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT</B><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 3 We will maintain high environmental standards so that Singapore will offer an attractive and conducive environment to people who live here and companies that do business here.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 4 Singaporeans today enjoy an air quality that is one of the best among cities around the world. While we remain vigilant in controlling pollution, we will put in greater efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through energy conservation and efficiency, and encouraging the use of cleaner energy. Through these efforts, we can also contribute to regional and international efforts to address issues of climate change and global environmental sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 We will reinforce efforts to reduce, re-use and recycle waste to minimise the volume of waste generated. This will further defer the need for additional landfills, which will be costly given the scarcity of land in Singapore.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <p align=left>Column: 29</p>  6 We will further strengthen our surveillance and public health programmes to prevent and curb any spread of vector-borne diseases. We will extend vector control programmes and build up competencies and research expertise in this area to ensure that Singapore maintains a low incidence of these diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 To further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the environmental sector, we will encourage and facilitate skills upgrading and job redesign. We will continue to embrace new environmental technologies and encourage companies to test-bed environmental innovations in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>WATER FOR ALL</B><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 8 Today, we have diversified our water supply sources through our four national taps: local catchments, imported sources, NEWater and desalination. This will help to ensure the sustainability and security of our water supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 We will put greater emphasis on managing water demand and conservation. We will also ensure affordability, service quality and reliability of our water supply, through adopting new technologies, improving operations, and facilitating public private partnerships. The Design, Build, Own and Operate (DBOO) arrangement for the supply of desalinated water will be extended to NEWater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND OWNERSHIP<br>\r\n</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p> 10 We will create more opportunities for the community to enjoy our environmental resources. We will introduce more activities in and around our reservoirs, without compromising our high water quality standards, so that everyone can enjoy our water bodies and become more mindful of the need to value and conserve our water resources. As social bonds can be strengthened through shared experiences, we will continue to upgrade uniquely Singaporean institutions such as hawker centres for all to enjoy and be proud of.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 11 Over the years, there has been greater community and corporate activism in protecting and enhancing our environment. We will strengthen the close partnership with schools, educational institutions, grassroots, as well as voluntary environmental organisations and businesses to advance the environmental agenda, so that community participation and ownership of environmental initiatives will grow. Because the future is in our youth, we will reach out to more young people and foster in them an active interest in environmental volunteerism and in enhancing and sustaining our environment.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF EDUCATION--><p align=left>Column: 29</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">MR THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM<br>\r\nMinister for Education</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 MOE aims to help every student discover his talents, realise his full potential, and develop a passion for learning that lasts though life. We will nurture among our young a spirit of inquiry and the willingness to think in new ways, solve new problems and create new opportunities for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p> <p align=left>Column: 31</p>  2We have introduced greater flexibility and choice in education over the last few years. We will build on these initiatives, to cater to the diverse abilities and interests of our students, in the arts, the sports and in intellectual and professional endeavour. We will provide our teachers with more resources and greater room to inspire our students in these directions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>NURTURING STUDENTS</B><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 3 We will seek to prepare students for life, through a broad-based and holistic education. More opportunities will be provided for students to acquire the skills and habits of mind that foster innovation, and develop strength of character and sound values, through a range of activities and programmes. We will trim curriculum requirements without diluting students\u2019 preparedness for further education. We will also review our pedagogical approaches to go beyond a focus on examinations.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 4 The new A-Level curriculum to be introduced from 2006 will further develop our students\u2019 thinking and communication skills, and engage them in greater breadth of learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 More flexibility and choice will be introduced into the curriculum to cater to the varying interests and aptitudes of the students. MOE will provide greater flexibility in the curriculum and progression for the Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) courses. Schools will also have further autonomy to establish curriculum niches of their own by offering elective modules as well as new \u2018O\u2019 level subjects.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 6 Many of our schools are developing niches of excellence, in the academic area or in the sports and arts. This will be given further impetus with the introduction of the Programme for School-based Excellence, which will provide additional resources to primary schools to develop distinct strengths of their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 The new NUS High School of Mathematics and Science and the proposed Arts School will complement the Singapore Sports School in catering to students with special talents in these fields. They will add to the increasing diversity of the mainstream school sector itself. Privately-funded secondary schools will also widen the range of educational choices for our students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8MOE will seek to ensure that our mother tongue languages remain vibrant and an integral part of Singapore society and identity. We will dedicate resources to teacher training and curriculum development to implement the recommendations of the Chinese Language Curriculum and Pedagogy Review Committee (CLCPRC). MOE is also conducting a similar review for Malay and Tamil language curricula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 To further encourage a holistic education, we are giving greater recognition to student achievements and talents in areas that are not captured in the national examinations. Schools and tertiary educations are being given further flexibility to admit such students on their merits, outside the central posting framework. From 2008, MOE will also issue School Graduation Certificates, which will reflect students\u2019 academic and non-academic achievements. Complementing these changes, the school ranking system has also been refined to encourage a broad-based education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n <p align=left>Column: 33</p>  10 We will continue to help raise the quality of education for children with special needs. MOE is increasing its support for Special Education (SPED) school infrastructure and providing additional development funding. SPED schools due for redevelopment will have their new or refurbished school buildings ready by 2008 instead of 2012. To allow children with mild to moderate learning disabilities to benefit from being part of mainstream schools, training in special needs will be provided to selected teachers in designated schools. This will raise general awareness of the different types of learning disabilities and help teachers identify and manage children with mild learning disabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>ENABLING TEACHERS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 11 MOE will continue to attract and retain committed, quality teachers, as a key priority in education in coming years. We will provide more teachers, full-time counsellors, increased manpower grants and greater autonomy to schools over the next 5 years. These initiatives will allow for more flexible classroom arrangements and provide teachers with more time and space to reflect and develop their own approaches to inspire their students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 12 MOE will continue to expand opportunities for teachers to develop themselves. Besides formal development courses, MOE will work with the business sector and community to provide teachers more work attachment opportunities, both locally and overseas. The network of schools overseas for teaching attachments will also be expanded. Our students will benefit from the fresh perspectives and experiences that these teachers bring back to the classrooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>POST-SECONDARY EDUCATION</B><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 13 MOE will provide more local university places for Singaporeans- from 21% of each primary one cohort in 2003 to 25% by 2010. As we expand our universities, they will be given greater autonomy and flexibility to develop excellence in research and compete globally. MOE will put in place an autonomy, governance and funding framework to ensure that the universities are well governed and resourced in this next, exciting phase of their development. Reputable private universities will also provide a wider choice of university education beyond the state-funded sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 14 Adding to this diverse university landscape, Singapore will have an open university offering degrees in its own name from 2006. The open university will provide greater opportunities for working adults who are keen to acquire new skills and knowledge, as well as attain higher educational qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 15 Courses in Polytechnics will become more multi-disciplinary and broad-based, while retaining their core technical strengths. This will better prepare our students to be versatile and adapt to new jobs and skills quickly. Polytechnic students can also expect more overseas exposure through short working stints, exchange programmes and community service projects to gain a first-hand appreciation of the vast opportunities and challenges around us.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 16 In tandem with the changes in our economy, ITE\u2019s training will continue to shift from a predominantly manufacturing focus to a twin focus on both the manufacturing and services sectors. ITE will also be transformed into \"One ITE System, Three Colleges\", starting with the first regional campus in Simei in 2005. This will take ITE a major step  <p align=left>Column: 35</p>  forward in becoming a centre of excellence in technical education, among the best in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF MANPOWER--><p align=left>Column: 35</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>MINISTRY OF MANPOWER</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">DR NG ENG HEN<br>\r\nMinister for Manpower</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 MOM\u2019s mission is to help Singaporeans have stable jobs and secure livelihoods. To achieve this, we must be able to compete globally with a productive and effective workforce. Our workers must have the right skills to help our businesses grow. We must create the necessary conditions through flexible wage and labour market policies to help our companies respond to the volatility in business cycles. We must uphold high standards of safety and employment practices to protect the well-being of our workers. We must maintain our harmonious labour relations and tripartite trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>BUILDING A GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE WORKFORCE</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Our workforce, our competitive edge</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 2 We will step up training to ensure that our workers have adequate skills to support existing and new businesses. We will work closely with employers to introduce a new National Continuing Education and Training framework which will provide clear pathways to upgrade our workers with skills that are more relevant and valued by employee and employer alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Responsive and Efficient Labour Market<br>\r\n</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p> 3 We must continue to help our companies grow and respond to volatile economic conditions. We will help companies implement flexible wage systems that motivate and reward workers for performance. The Employment Act has also been amended to allow for flexible work schedules to optimise the use of manpower resources.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 4 We will help companies to be more competitive through greater flexibility in manpower supply. Where there are not enough Singaporeans to meet their needs, we will help them get the relevant skilled foreign manpower that they need. Foreign workers provide a ready pool of skills to enable companies to quickly start up or expand businesses while we train Singaporeans for jobs in new industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 We must therefore continue to attract talented and skilled foreign manpower to raise the overall quality of our workforce. To achieve this, we will enhance the flexibility of our workpass system and streamline processes so that companies will find it easier to get the right type of manpower. This will create more jobs for Singaporeans as our economy grows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Help for vulnerable workers</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6As our economy restructures towards higher value-added industries, there will be some workers who are vulnerable to structural unemployment due to their lack of skills. The Government will work hard together with our social partners - NTUC and employer organisations- to keep these workers within the workforce. Multi-pronged approaches are necessary to provide holistic assistance to help such vulnerable workers acquire the right<p align=left>Column: 37</p>  skills and work ethic to remain employable. Job redesign to raise the productivity and pay of some jobs will be a critical area of focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 With longer life expectancy and an aging population, we will also focus more on our older workers. They will need to work for a longer period during their lifetime to save for a comfortable retirement, but at the same time they are at greater risk of being unemployed. We will find ways to safeguard their income security through enhancing their employability and improving their competitiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>GETTING THE BEST FROM OUR WORKERS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8 Employees must be treated well to enhance their performance at work. To assist in these efforts, MOM and WDA will develop programmes to strengthen the capabilities of line managers and Human Resource professionals. We will encourage companies to improve the quality of their workplaces so as to create a competitive advantage to attract and retain talent. Key performance indicators must be clearly laid out and understood by employees. Good performances must be rewarded adequately and promptly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 Employers must build quality workplaces that enable our workers to achieve a better work-life harmony. This includes supporting environments for marriage and procreation. The amendments to the Employment Act last year to extend maternity leave and introduce childcare leave were major steps forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Protecting the health and well-being of workers</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n10 All workers, local and foreign, are protected under our employment laws and deserve to be treated fairly and decently. We will strengthen detection and enforcement to reduce the incidence of salary arrears and employment malpractices. Employers who exploit their foreign workers and compromise their well-being will be taken to task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 11 All workers must have the assurance that their workplaces are safe. If they do get injured in the course of their work they must be fairly and promptly compensated. Recent accidents have shown that we need to enhance the level of safety consciousness among workers and employers. We will introduce a new Workplace Safety and Health Act that will broaden the coverage of occupational safety and health to workplaces such as hotels, restaurants and hospitals. We will introduce external safety auditors to help monitor safety breaches and augment enforcement efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>TRIPARTITE COOPERATION AND INDUSTRIAL HARMONY</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 12 The close tripartite partnership between the government, employers and trade unions has been integral to our economic success. We will continue to build on this strong tripartite partnership. A strong partnership will greatly enhance our capability to realise our vision of achieving a great workforce and great workplaces for Singapore.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, YOUTH AND SPORTS--><p align=left>Column: 37</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>MINISTRY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, YOUTH AND SPORTS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">DR VIVIAN BALAKRISHNAN<br>\r\nActing Minister for Community Development, Youthand Sports</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 MCYS\u2019s mission is to build a cohesive and resilient Singapore - a diverse but united people, and a society that can overcome all challenges. To realise this, we will develop  <p align=left>Column: 39</p> inspired and committed youth, ensure that the less able are not \"left behind\", support older Singaporeans, make Singapore a great place for family life, bond Singaporeans through sports, and reinforce racial and religious harmony. We will also work with our community and social service sector partners to ensure better alignment of services and achieve synergy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>SUPPORTING INSPIRED &amp; COMMITTED YOUTH</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 2 The renaming of MCDS to MCYS on 1st September 2004 signifies the Government\u2019s commitment to nurture young Singaporeans into self-reliant and resilient citizens. Given the right opportunities to ignite their idealism and imagination, young Singaporeans can contribute to Singapore, and in the process, develop a stronger sense of belonging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3 A key priority is to empower our youth to make a difference to Singapore, and thus reinforce their sense of belonging. MCYS and the National Youth Council will encourage the formation of more formal and informal youth groups, link up our youth to these groups, conduct courses to enhance youth leadership skills, provide seed funding and support for youth-initiated community projects and open up more channels for young Singaporeans to discuss national and community issues, including involving them in decision making roles where appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 4 Some young Singaporeans need extra support to realise their potential. MCYS will work with schools and community organisations on preventive and developmental programmes for those who need additional help. We will enhance the employability of out-of-school youths and ex-youth offenders through further education and skills training, and provide them with more opportunities for social participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>GREATER SOCIAL MOBILITY FOR LOW INCOME SINGAPOREANS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 We cannot be a cohesive society if the low-income families are left behind. The most effective assistance is to equip people with the skills and attitudes to be employable. MCYS will review our social assistance schemes, and forge closer linkages between social and job assistance. We will also work towards systematic case management, with dedicated counselling for those receiving assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6 More resources will be committed to help children from lower-income families. The Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE) Scheme was implemented to help needy families keep their families small and concentrate their resources on uplifting their children in order to escape the poverty trap. Needy families can receive assistance of up to $100,000 for housing, children\u2019s education, training as well as cash grants. We will enhance outreach to needy families to encourage them to participate in the Scheme. We will also focus on early childhood education to prepare the children for a better future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 MCYS will adopt an early intervention approach for children with special needs, which can help mitigate the negative effects of a disability. We will look into how parents of infants with a disability can be better supported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8 Another strategy is to help persons with disabilities better integrate into mainstream society by improving access to assistive technology, public transport, and jobs. In  <p align=left>Column: 41</p> addition, we will work with Voluntary Welfare Organisations to enhance support programmes for families of the disabled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>SUPPORTING OLDER SINGAPOREANS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 While our young create our future, we owe our present success to the efforts of older Singaporeans. MCYS will continue to support the social, mental and physical well-being of the growing proportion of older Singaporeans. We will create more programmes for the elderly to be engaged in society, as remaining active after retirement is critical to their well-being. MCYS will also facilitate the development of a \"silver industry\" to cater to the economic and social aspirations of increasingly better-educated retirees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 10 Many frail elderly are cared for by family members. These carers in turn deserve our support. MCYS will place emphasis on caregivers\u2019 programmes, to help meet the carers\u2019 needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>MAKING SINGAPORE A GREAT PLACE FOR FAMILY LIFE</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 11 Singapore faces a dwindling birth rate. One reason is that more Singaporeans are staying single. We want to energise the local dating industry to give singles more opportunities to meet a life partner. We also want Singapore to be a great place for raising children. We will review our pro-family policies, expand childcare options, and support parenthood, including promoting the role of fathers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>BONDING THE NATION THROUGH SPORTS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 12 Sports builds character, cultivates resilience and a healthy lifestyle. Sports also bonds Singaporeans of different backgrounds, and can boost national pride. MCYS will provide more opportunities for Singaporeans to play sports. We will work with MOE and the People\u2019s Association to open up school fields for public use. MCYS will also work with the national sports associations to develop our athletes, for the country to celebrate their achievements in future international games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 13 MCYS will be building a new Sports Hub at Kallang through the Public-Private Partnership model. It will encompass a new national stadium, an aquatics centre, and other lifestyle and commercial facilities. The Sports Hub will help us build a sporting culture, and attract more international sports and entertainment events here. MCYS will also market Singapore as a host for international sports meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>REINFORCING RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS HARMONY</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 14 Communal harmony is essential for social cohesion and resilience. MCYS will continue to encourage mutual respect of ethnic and religious diversity, and grow the common spaces between different communities. We will partner community and religious organisations to strengthen the social fabric.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>MAJLIS UGAMA ISLAM SINGAPURA (MUIS)</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 15 MUIS will continue to provide leadership and guidance on Islamic matters to the Muslim community. MUIS will work with the mosques, <I>madrasahs</I>, Malay/Muslim as well <p align=left>Column: 43</p>  as national organisations to build a Muslim community of excellence that is grounded with religious values and socially progressive, contributing to the nation's progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 16 MUIS will further develop a comprehensive and progressive curriculum at all levels for Islamic religious education. MUIS strives to groom <I>madrasah</I> students to be credible and dynamic religious and community leaders, cognisant of the challenges of modern society. MUIS will continue to empower Malay/Muslim families requiring support through innovative programmes that aim towards self reliance. MUIS will work in partnership and collaboration with various ethnic and religious groups to enhance racial and religious harmony in Singapore. In this regard, MUIS will also facilitate greater cooperation between the mosques and other community organisations to deepen inter-ethnic understanding and relations at the community level.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE (POPULATION POLICIES)--><p align=left>Column: 43</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE (POPULATION POLICIES</B>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">MR WONG KAN SENG<br>\r\nMinister for Home Affairs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 People make Singapore what it is. Singapore needs to be a country where a committed, energetic and able population build a future where they will find security, opportunity and fulfilment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>A GREAT PLACE FOR FAMILIES</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 2 A nation has to look beyond economic pursuits as its sole pre-occupation. Singaporeans also aspire to savour some of the less-tangibles in life, including giving their children a happy childhood, and having emotional fulfilment in nurturing families. It is such priceless experiences and fond memories that make Singapore the best home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3 Families in Singapore already enjoy a safe environment, good infrastructure, a sound education system and a cohesive society. Beyond these positive factors, we aim to make Singapore a great place for families by enhancing our support for Singaporeans who have made the personal decision to be parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 4 In August 2004, the Government launched a comprehensive package of measures to better support Singaporean parents in a broad range of areas including financial cost, the ability to spend more time with their children, the range of childcare options, and a better balance between work and family life. These measures include greater use of Medisave for pregnancy and birth-related medical expenses, an enhanced Baby Bonus scheme, longer maternity leave, childcare leave, infant care subsidy, foreign domestic worker levy concession, grandparent caregiver tax relief and a fund to encourage family-friendly work practices. We will monitor the effectiveness of the package and feedback from the public, and make refinements to the schemes if necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 We will also continue to review our pro-family policies, infrastructure and practices. This will include working with employers, unions and workers to foster work-life harmony. It will also include enhancing our infant- and child-care services to better meet the needs of Singaporean families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6 In the longer term, we will work towards achieving a shift in social attitudes towards marriage and parenthood so that Singaporeans can strike a better balance between developing their careers and finding joy and fulfilment in their children and families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n <p align=left>Column: 45</p> <B>A MAGNET FOR TALENT</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 Much of Singapore\u2019s transformation over the past forty years is founded on the efforts of immigrants from the Malay Archipelago, China, India and beyond. We must continue to offer opportunities for, and extend a welcome to, foreigners with diverse skills, talent and aptitudes. This will make Singapore a more attractive business location and in turn create more economic opportunities for all Singaporeans. It will also lead to greater diversity and vibrancy in our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8 To achieve this, we will continue to review our work pass policies and processes to attract and welcome skilled individuals. We will also broaden the pool of foreigners who can pursue opportunities in Singapore and contribute to its growth in different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 We will encourage those who identify with our values and way of life to sink roots here as permanent residents and as citizens. We will also do more to help them and their families settle in and integrate to our society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>FIRST PRIORITY TO CITIZENS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 10 While the Government welcomes foreigners and immigrants, its first responsibility has been, and always will be, to Singaporeans. Citizens are the core of our nation. The Government will ensure that it will always look after our citizens better than permanent residents and foreigners.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT--><p align=left>Column: 45</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Transport (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">MR YEO CHEOW TONG<br>\r\nMinister for Transport</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 MOT will enhance Singapore\u2019s economic competitiveness by strengthening our position as a leading transportation and logistics hub. We will also continue to provide Singaporeans with an effective, efficient and affordable public transport system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>LEADING HUB PORT</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 2 Singapore is currently the world\u2019s busiest port and largest transhipment hub. To cater to the future growth of our port sector, we will develop more berths at Pasir Panjang. MOT\u2019s vision is to grow Singapore as a hub port for all types of high-value cargo, such as containers, vehicles and petrochemicals. We will maintain our position as the top bunkering port in the world by continuing to focus on quality, high standards and cost competitiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>PREMIER AVIATION HUB</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3 Despite the severe impact on air travel brought about by terrorism and the SARS outbreak, the aviation industry has recovered and air traffic has bounced back. MOT aims to increase the passenger and cargo throughput at Changi Airport. We will attract more airlines to call at Singapore by providing a competitive incentive package through our Air Hub Development Fund. MOT will also continue to adopt a liberal air transport policy to extend Changi\u2019s air network and connectivity to other cities of the world, especially in emerging markets like China and India. To provide the best travel experience for our <p align=left>Column: 47</p>  customers, we are upgrading our facilities at Terminal 2, followed by Terminal 1. In addition, the new Terminal 3 will be completed in 2008 to meet our projected traffic growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 4 The emergence of budget airlines has reduced the cost of regional air travel. This will promote tourist inflow and help boost our services sector. MOT will develop Singapore as a leading hub for budget airlines. We will facilitate the growth of Singapore budget airlines and encourage more regional budget airlines to fly here. We are also building a budget airline terminal at Changi Airport, to be completed in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>IMPROVING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE TRANSPORT</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 Providing Singaporeans with an efficient and affordable public transport system remains a key priority for MOT. We will continue to develop our public transport infrastructure and improve the travel experience for commuters. We will also work closely with the public transport operators to enhance our bus, rail and taxi services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6 This year, we will open the Light Rapid Transit (LRT) systems in Sengkang West and Punggol East. LTA will commence works to extend the East-West Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line beyond Boon Lay station. When completed in 2009, the East-West Line will serve Jurong West and the Jurong Industrial Estate. Together with other government agencies, MOT is also developing a transport network for the New Downtown at Marina Bay. To enhance our bus services, MOT is looking into measures to improve the efficiency of our bus network and reduce travel times. We are also reviewing the mechanism to determine public transport fares. One key objective is to incentivise the operators to improve their productivity so as to keep fares affordable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 For private transport, we have put in place systems to control the ownership and usage of private vehicles to achieve smooth-flowing traffic on our roads. We will continue to develop our road network and make use of technology such as traffic surveillance cameras and information dissemination systems to maximise road capacity. With economic growth, and a growing car population, road traffic will continue to increase. We will expand the ERP cordon to other areas and times of the day where traffic conditions warrant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>ENHANCING TRANSPORT SECURITY</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8 In a post 9-11 environment, security has become an increasingly important concern for many sectors, including transport. Together with the security agencies, MOT will enhance the security at our airports, sea ports, bus interchanges and MRT stations, while balancing the need to maintain cost competitiveness, affordability and operational efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>ENABLING OPPORTUNITIES AND CREATING JOBS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 MOT will work closely with the industry to facilitate new business opportunities and create more jobs for Singaporeans. We will develop Singapore as an International Maritime Centre. MOT will continue to grow the Singapore Registry of Ships as a quality flag, and enhance our incentive schemes and operating environment to attract more ship owners and operators. We will strengthen our maritime services cluster by developing a comprehensive suite of ancillary services such as ship financing, marine insurance, <p align=left>Column: 49</p>  maritime R&amp;D, maritime legal and arbitration services. To develop Singapore\u2019s maritime expertise, MOT will continue to support maritime education and training, and encourage more Singaporeans to take up maritime and maritime-related careers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 10 Lastly, MOT will regularly review our rules and regulations to facilitate business activities and promote entrepreneurship in the transport sector. We will partner the industry to enhance competitiveness and provide more opportunities for our companies to succeed in an increasingly global and connected economy.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF INFORMATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS--><p align=left>Column: 49</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Lee Boon Yang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>MINISTRY OF INFORMATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">DR LEE BOON YANG<br>\r\nMinister for Information, Communications and The Arts</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 MICA\u2019s mission is to bring about a Creative People, a Gracious Community and a Connected Singapore.

This will also provide the community with a stronger sense of identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3 Our libraries are creative spaces where knowledge and imagination can be fused to create new possibilities for Singaporeans. With its extensive network of libraries, the National Library Board will continue to support life-long learning among Singaporeans. The new National Library will open in 2005. It will have a world-class reference and resource centre for Asian materials and incorporate the New Drama Centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 4 MICA will build an Independent Arts School by 2008 to provide integrated arts and academic secondary education for artistically inclined students. The school will enable its students to interact and collaborate with artists and the community. The school will also widen the educational choices open to young Singaporeans, encourage them to consider careers in the arts, as well as develop leaders in other fields with a strong foundation in the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 MICA will transform Singapore\u2019s civic district into a bustling arts and cultural hub. The Supreme Court and City Hall Buildings will be converted into a world-class art gallery to showcase Singapore and regional art. It will also serve as a venue for International Art Exhibitions. Victoria Concert Hall and Victoria Theatre will also be refurbished and the Asian Civilisations Museum at Armenian Street will be converted into a Peranakan museum. In 2006, MICA will organise the first Singapore International Visual Arts Biennale <p align=left>Column: 51</p> to showcase the works of artists from Singapore, our region and Asia. These developments will broaden, deepen and strengthen our cultural capital to contribute towards realising our vision of Singapore as a Global Arts City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6 Our citizenry will become better informed and attuned to global trends. To provide greater choice for Singaporeans, we shall introduce more content classification for media and entertainment choices. However, we will continue to ensure that the public space remains wholesome. Greater choice means that individuals must take greater responsibility for what they and their families choose to watch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>FULFILLING LIVES</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 MICA will continue to develop the Creative Industries as a key driver of Singapore\u2019s economy. This will spark off new employment opportunities in such areas as industrial and web design, film, television, fashion, mobile content, video and on-line games, publishing and music recording. Through the Renaissance City 2.0, Design Singapore and Media 21 Programmes, more resources will be channelled towards the development of creative capabilities in order to build up our talent pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8The info-communication technology (ICT) sector will also continue to be a key engine of growth and a major creator of jobs. The Infocomm Development Authority will seek strategic partners to deploy new technologies and business models, such as business process outsourcing, grid technology, 3G mobile telephony and digital media. MICA will also seek partners to enhance Singapore\u2019s broadband infrastructure. As part of the Connected Singapore Blueprint, all users in Singapore will enjoy pervasive and high-speed broadband access, through both wired and wireless means.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>EMBRACING SINGAPORE</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9We shall continue to make Singapore the BEST home for all Singaporeans, engaging Singaporeans and international talents both at home and abroad to build a better Singapore. We shall reinforce national resilience by strengthening the ties between all our citizens and re-connect with Singaporeans abroad to enhance their sense of belonging. We will encourage Singaporeans to make greater use of our National Flag and National symbols to express our Singaporean identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 10 We will strive to raise awareness of developments and opportunities in Singapore amongst our international partners through cultural diplomacy. MICA will leverage on our arts and culture to project Singapore. In 2005, MICA working with public and private sector partners will launch the Inaugural Singapore Season in London. This aims to boost the international profile of Singapore arts and culture, and present Singapore in a holistic manner to complement our strong business and efficiency reputation. Through such national marketing efforts, MICA will celebrate Singapore\u2019s unique cosmopolitan and multi-cultural heritage so that Singaporeans and the world will feel Singapore is \"The Place To Be\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE--><p align=left>Column: 51</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>AN OPEN AND CLEAN PUBLIC SECTOR</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 1 We will ensure the highest degree of integrity in government, the civil service, the Judiciary and the public service, while encouraging corruption-free transactions in the  <p align=left>Column: 53</p> private sector. We will maintain a strong anti-corruption ethos in Singapore. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau will continue to take swift and vigorous action against any corrupt tendencies and maintain its role as an independent and effective investigation agency. It will be vigilant and will upgrade its investigative capabilities by adopting best practices and improving methods of evidence collection, including a greater application of forensic science in its work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>AN ENABLING PUBLIC SERVICE</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 2 The Public Service works with the elected government to serve our people. As our society and economy grow in sophistication and complexity, we will build an enabling public service- one that makes it possible for individuals and organisations to create and pursue opportunities to fulfil their aspirations and to contribute to the well-being of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3 Government agencies must respond flexibly to their specific customers and environment, yet also work collectively as one government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 4 The core values of integrity, service and excellence are the foundations of the Public Service. The shared principles of governance- leadership is key, reward for work and work for reward, a stake for everyone, opportunities for all, anticipate change and stay relevant- guide our government agencies and public servants. These values and principles provide coherence and common purpose as the Public Service works to achieve shared national outcomes through customer and citizen focus, developing the capabilities of our civil servants, and improving system management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>OUR CITIZENS AND CUSTOMERS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 We will organise government around citizens and customers and their needs so as to serve them better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6 Through customer-centred, inter-agency mechanisms like the Pro-Enterprise Panel, the Zero-In Process and the No-Wrong Door approach, we will work to make Many Agencies, One Government a reality in public services. We will strike a better balance between regulating for safety and integrity, and facilitating for vibrancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 We will also engage with citizens more effectively, and work with them as partners. By sharing in the responsibility of identifying opportunities and problems, devising strategies and implementing solutions, our citizens will develop a greater sense of ownership for Singapore and our future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>DEVELOPING OUR CIVIL SERVANTS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8 Developing the capabilities of our civil servants will remain a key priority. We need to have good leaders and managers at every level of the civil service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 We will ensure that salaries and benefits remain competitive through annual salary reviews and regular benchmarking. We will look into how best to peg remuneration to job type and size so as to be more responsive to changes in private sector conditions. Strengthening the link between pay and performance will also motivate public officers to perform better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n <p align=left>Column: 55</p>  10 We will also make our human resource management practices more responsive and flexible. Ministries will have more flexibility to decide on terms and conditions of employment, and to promote family-friendly practices, such as part-time employment and flexible work arrangements. We will also raise the professionalism and expertise of civil service HR practitioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 11 To support our capacity to question, anticipate and innovate, we will continue to diversify the public sector talent pool. We aim to recruit mid-career people with a wide range of working experience. We will review how PSC selects scholars to align its approach with the more diverse education landscape, and continue to offer scholarships for study in different countries. We will also continue to widen the perspectives of our most promising officers through initiatives such as the Gap Year Programme which give them the opportunity to work in the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 12 We will also train and develop officers at all levels to equip them with the right knowledge, skills, and attitudes to deliver excellence in public service. Fostering a common ethos across the Public Service will remain a priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>OUR SYSTEMS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 13 We will continue to promote organisational excellence and sound resource management within each agency in order to build the capacity to implement policies flexibly and well, and deliver sustainable results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 14 We will ensure that we have robust systems and processes to anticipate the future through scenario planning, identify and address key issues across government through mechanisms such as the Strategic Issues Group, and promote and share best practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n15 The Public Service will constantly improve and innovate, to enhance our capacity to work to a common vision, think ahead and act as one government, to better serve Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY--><p align=left>Column: 55</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>MINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">MR LIM HNG KIANG<br>\r\nMinister for Trade and Industry</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 Singapore will be a land of opportunity for businesses to flourish and for entrepreneurs to pursue their dreams, so that Singaporeans can fulfil their potential and enjoy rising living standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>OUR EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 2 Rapid globalisation and technological advancements pose challenges, but also present new opportunities. The world is our market, and new value can be created through innovative fusion of ideas and technologies. A burgeoning middle class is fast emerging in Asia. Their lifestyle aspirations will create huge demand for quality goods and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>THRIVING MANUFACTURING</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3 The future for manufacturing in Singapore remains bright. We have built up core competencies in key clusters like electronics, engineering and chemicals. Our biomedical  <p align=left>Column: 57</p> science efforts are also yielding good results. EDB will strengthen these clusters and maintain our competitive edge. We will manufacture higher value products and undertake more knowledge-intensive activities like product development and design. We will also leverage on our competencies to move into new growth areas like photonics and nanotechnology. Traditional industries like food, furniture, textiles and apparel will be revitalised through the adoption of technology or new business models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 4 Our manufacturing must be supported by a strong foundation in science and technology and top class infrastructure. The Ministerial Committee on Research and Development (R&amp;D) will review the strategic directions for R&amp;D in Singapore. A*STAR will draw up the Science &amp; Technology Plan 2010, a blueprint to strengthen our R&amp;D capabilities and develop research manpower. Greater emphasis will be placed on cross-disciplinary technology platforms to support industry innovation. JTC will continue to pioneer leading edge projects like One North and upgrade existing industrial facilities. EMA has completed the restructuring of the electricity sector, which has brought about efficiency and cost savings. The restructuring of the gas sector is underway. EMA will further enhance Singapore\u2019s energy resilience and security, including studying the importation of liquefied natural gas to diversify supply sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>VIBRANT SERVICES</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 Singapore will be home to a broad array of service industries. We will accelerate the growth of existing services like information technology, trading and logistics. We will also leverage on our strength in education and healthcare to serve the growing regional demand for these services. Digital media is another industry that is poised for more rapid growth. Fusionpolis in One North will be an iconic focal point for its development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6 We will rejuvenate our tourism sector to turn Singapore into Asia\u2019s lifestyle city. STB has unveiled its Tourism 2015 vision to double visitor arrivals to 17 million. Our entertainment offering will be greatly enhanced by the development of themed resorts, family attractions and exciting events. SDC will transform Sentosa into a world-class leisure destination and develop Southern Islands to meet Singapore\u2019s future recreational needs. We will remake Orchard Road to inject greater vitality and excitement into our main shopping belt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>GLOBAL CONNECTIONS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 Singapore is at the heart of ASEAN and the crossroads of the growing giants of China and India. We will continue to deepen economic ties with our key trading partners, as well as expand linkages with emerging markets in Middle East and Latin America. Regional integration will be enhanced through initiatives like the ASEAN Economic Community and ASEAN-plus Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). We will also contribute towards the successful conclusion of the WTO Doha Development Agenda, and participate actively in APEC and ASEM. Our expanding web of bilateral FTAs complements our efforts at the regional and multilateral fora. We are working on FTAs with India, Korea, Panama, Chile, Kuwait, and Qatar to increase our global reach. IE Singapore will help companies tap overseas business opportunities by providing market intelligence and facilitation through its network of overseas offices. We will also build up the Singapore brand name and trust mark, so that our goods and services enjoy an even higher level of international standing and recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n <p align=left>Column: 59</p> <B>FULFILLING POTENTIAL</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8 A bustling and diversified economy will offer a wide variety of exciting opportunities for individuals to make the best use of their talents. We will work with MOE and MOM to enable Singaporeans to learn, improve their skills, and develop their abilities to the fullest. We will build on Singapore as a talent magnet, and continue to attract and welcome international talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 Singapore will be among the world\u2019s best places to start and grow a business. We will continue to provide a conducive business environment with low taxes and prudent fiscal and monetary policies. We will press on with our efforts to cut red tape, keep regulatory burden low, and stay cost competitive. A Competition Commission has been set up to enforce the new Competition Act, which will provide a level playing field for businesses to compete. We will broaden the avenues of enterprise financing, and increase the access of good ideas to smart monies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 10 We must encourage entrepreneurship and nurture the growth of enterprises as they create wealth and employment. Our various agencies will work together to provide comprehensive and integrated assistance to companies. There will be a stronger focus on helping companies build core capabilities in technology, branding, distribution and financial management. We will also improve on our programme delivery. SPRING will establish a One-Stop Centre for SMEs. We will develop closer partnership with business and industry associations to upgrade the capability and improve the productivity of their members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF FINANCE--><p align=left>Column: 59</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">MR LEE HSIEN LOONG<br>\r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Finance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>SINGAPORE \u2013 LAND OF OPPORTUNITY</B><br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 The focus of our fiscal policy is to help make Singapore a land of opportunity- a dynamic economy infused with the spirit of enterprise and innovation and an inclusive society which recognises different talents, abilities and needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>COMMITMENT TO SOUND FISCAL POLICY</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 2 Sound fiscal policy underpins our macroeconomic stability which ensures sustainable growth and the expansion of opportunities. The Government will aim to balance the budget over its term of office and grow our reserves. This will provide us the resources to deal with the challenges of an uncertain security environment, economic restructuring and an ageing population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3We will continue to invest in new areas that reflect the changing needs and demands of our economy and society. To reinforce this, we have set up a reinvestment fund that pools a part of ministries' budget for redistribution to new priority areas ranging from pre-school programmes to our creative industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n <p align=left>Column: 61</p> <B>PROMOTING ENTERPRISE</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 4 The Government will ensure a competitive tax regime that will promote private enterprise and individual initiative. Besides the on-going efforts to lower tax rates and simplify the tax structure, the Government will reduce the burden on businesses by cutting red tape and setting its fees and charges at cost unless higher rates are needed to deter excessive usage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 We will also strive to make Singapore a preferred place for doing business by simplifying business regulation, enhancing our corporate governance standards and accounting practices, and introducing new business forms - such as a limited partnership and limited liability partnership- to increase the options available to businessmen and investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>BUILDING AN EXCELLENT PUBLIC SERVICE</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6 \"Many Agencies, One Government\" will remain the basis of how we organise services to offer greater convenience for the public. We will further enhance our customer-centric approach to providing public services through our e-Government programme which collaborates with the private and people sectors to provide a seamless experience to customers who need to transact with multiple parties. Those who have no personal access to the Internet or are unable to cope will continue to get help through an increasing network of eCitizen Helper Centres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 The Government will continually seek the best value for taxpayers' monies. We will do this by getting the most efficient provider to deliver public services, by managing our manpower growth more carefully and to continually economise and cut waste in the public sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8 The Government has also introduced the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model as a way to tap on private initiative and innovation for more efficient delivery of complex government projects with capital value in excess of $50 million. Over the next three to five years, the Government will explore the use of PPP for more than $1 billion worth of projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>REAFFIRMING OUR SOCIAL COMPACT</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 Shared prosperity will remain the cornerstone of our social compact. There will be sharing of surpluses accumulated in good years. The Government will continue to subsidise education, basic health care and public housing to ensure that they are affordable. We will also provide targeted assistance to those in need. The Government will work through community-based organisations to help the unemployed and those facing financial distress to become self-reliant and independent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 10 The people sector can play a vital role in this effort. We will promote voluntarism and philanthropy to strengthen our collective social responsibility to those less able and fortunate. And we will work with the people sector to improve governance and accountability in charity. This will help preserve public confidence and encourage informed giving.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE (MONETARY POLICIES AND FINANCIAL SUPERVISION)--><p align=left>Column: 63</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Goh Chok Tong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B> PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE(MONETARY POLICIES &amp; FINANCIAL SUPERVISION)</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">MR GOH CHOK TONG<br>\r\nSenior Minister and Minister-in-charge of MAS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 Our monetary policy framework has served us well over the years in promoting sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. MAS will continue to strengthen the monetary policy formulation process by enhancing its forecasting, surveillance and research capabilities. This will ensure that the conduct of monetary policy continues to be robust and flexible in the light of significant structural adjustments in the economy and greater volatility in the external environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 2 Singapore\u2019s financial sector is well regulated, sound and dynamic. In its oversight of the financial services sector, MAS will enhance the risk-based supervisory framework that it has been developing in recent years, in line with changes in the industry and evolving risk issues. As our local players expand their activities regionally, MAS will intensify its efforts in consolidated and integrated supervision. MAS will also seek to further raise standards of market conduct in the industry, by refining existing disclosure standards and strengthening consumer education. Singapore\u2019s position as a leading financial centre in Asia will be enhanced as MAS continues to cultivate the wealth management business as well as build greater depth and liquidity in domestic capital markets. Emphasis will be placed on new growth areas such as alternative investments, structured products, trust and philanthropy advisory services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3 MAS is committed to fight money laundering and terrorist financing. As with all major financial centres, our efforts will be guided by the cardinal principle of customer confidentiality. While banking confidentiality will not be permitted to act as a shield for criminal activity, it will not be lifted upon spurious requests to fish for information. Our domestic laws contain safeguards to protect the privacy of banking and other financial information and we will continue to require that these be observed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 4 MAS and the Ministry of Finance are preparing for the hosting of the International Monetary Fund/World Bank September 2006 Annual Meetings in Singapore. The event will showcase the two Bretton Woods Institutions\u2019 role in international efforts to reduce poverty and foster economic development. We will use the occasion to promote Singapore as a global city and international financial centre to live and do business in. As the event will be held ten years after the Asian Financial Crisis, it will also be timely to bring world attention to the growth and business opportunities in Asia as a whole and ASEAN in particular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS--><p align=left>Column: 63</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">MR GEORGE YEO YONG-BOON<br>\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><B>STRATEGIC LANDSCAPE</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 1 The strategic landscape is becoming a little clearer. Globalisation is increasing global trade and the interdependence of nations. As borders become more porous, the  <p align=left>Column: 65</p> distinction between domestic policy and foreign policy has blurred. Politics, economics and security are increasingly bound up together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 2 The enlargement of Europe and the rise of China and India are changing the global balance of power. The relationship of the great powers to one another is reconfiguring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3 The rapid growth of China and India presents us with new challenges and opportunities. We must respond to the new global trade flows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 4 The problem of global terrorism is of a long-term nature. It has to be addressed at different levels and on many fronts. No country can fight the war against terrorism alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>SINGAPORE'S FOREIGN POLICY PRIORITIES</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 Southeast Asia is our base. Creating a strong ASEAN community is at the heart of our foreign policy. We need closer economic integration and effective regional institutions. Such an ASEAN will be able to establish stronger political and economic ties with dialogue partners. In the war against terrorism, we have to work closely together in ASEAN and also with our friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6 We will work to strengthen our relations with all our neighbours based on mutual respect and mutual benefit. We will give particular attention to Indonesia and Malaysia which are our closest neighbours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 Our objective is to have good relations with all the major powers while maintaining our autonomy. We will continue to improve our relationship with the US, EU, Japan, China, India and Russia. Our links to most countries in East Asia, South Asia and Australasia are excellent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8 We are also reaching out to new partners. We are expanding our political and economic links to the entire Middle East. The Asia-Middle East Dialogue (AMED) is part of this overall effort. The Forum for East Asia and Latin America Cooperation (FEALAC) is a springboard for us to engage Latin America. Our links to Brazil are growing. We have begun preliminary discussion with the South African Customs Union on a Free Trade Agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 As a small country, Singapore has an abiding interest in the proper functioning of international and regional organisations.We support the reform of the UN and its playing a greater role in world affairs. We participate actively in the WTO and work for an early conclusion of the Doha negotiations. We view APEC as a regional grouping which will help to secure peace and prosperity in the Pacific. We would like to see a stronger ASEM bringing the EU and East Asia closer together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 10 In recent years, there has been growing international interest in Singapore's development experience. Although our resources are limited, we try our best to help those who request our assistance. The Singapore Cooperation Programme is an important channel for us to make friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 11 As Singapore's external wing grows, more of our citizens will travel overseas for work, study and vacation. While it is not possible to service them everywhere, we will provide facilities in the major cities where we have substantial economic interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF DEFENCE--><p align=left>Column: 67</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Defence (Mr Teo Chee Hean)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B> MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">MR TEO CHEE HEAN<br>\r\nMinister for Defence</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 Security is the bedrock for our efforts to build a future of opportunity and promise for all Singaporeans. The security environment will continue to be marked by uncertainty. A strong defence gives us the space to act in Singapore\u2019s best interests and enables Singaporeans to go about our daily lives with the assurance that the SAF is ready and able to safeguard our security and our nation\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 2 <I>Defence and Deterrence</I>. We face a real threat of terrorism. The SAF will work in close co-ordination with other agencies to counter this threat. The SAF will continue to develop the necessary capabilities to provide a more flexible and potent response to this transnational and asymmetric security threat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3 The primary mission of the SAF is the defence of Singapore\u2019s sovereignty. Even as it develops capabilities to conduct non-conventional operations, the SAF will focus on strengthening its conventional capabilities. The SAF is transforming to meet the challenges of the more technologically demanding and complex nature of warfare. The 3rd Generation SAF will be leaner and more tightly networked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 4<I>Diplomacy</I>. Diplomacy is the other pillar of Singapore\u2019s defence policy. MINDEF will continue to actively pursue mutually beneficial defence co-operation with friendly countries to enhance Singapore\u2019s security and regional stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 MINDEF will also continue to participate actively in multi-lateral defence interactions to foster understanding, build confidence, and bring together international and regional partners to deal with common threats and preserve peace and security. Multilateral co-operation is imperative when the threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, have no regard for national boundaries. MINDEF will therefore contribute to multinational initiatives to combat non-conventional transnational threats, and will continue to work multilaterally and bilaterally to enhance regional maritime security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6<I>Technology</I>. Technology helps us surmount our population and resource limitations; it is a force multiplier. It gives the SAF the edge in the modern battlefield. Our transformation efforts will exploit information networks, remotely operated platforms and precision weapons. New operational concepts will co-evolve with new technologies. MINDEF will continue to build up our indigenous technological capacities, particularly in R&amp;D, for that will be key to achieving transformation. We will continue to leverage on our extensive network of international collaborative links to accelerate the building of these capacities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7<I>Training</I>. We will train our people to the highest levels of effectiveness and efficiency. Our servicemen will be well equipped to ensure that they can make use of new technologies and transformational concepts. Advanced simulation technologies will be exploited to enhance training efficiency and realism. The SAF will also continue to benchmark itself against the best armed forces in the world. We will maintain our access to traditional training facilities in friendly countries, while exploring additional opportunities for overseas training. Training safety will always be a priority for the SAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n  <p align=left>Column: 69</p> 8<I>People</I>. The SAF\u2019s strength lies ultimately in the spirit, commitment and professionalism of our servicemen and servicewomen. They are the core of the SAF. MINDEF will develop them to achieve their highest potential. MINDEF will also ensure that it continues to attract our fair share of talent into the SAF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 <I>National Service.</I> The transformation to the 3rd Generation SAF enables us to reduce the length of full-time National Service and streamline the NS training cycle without compromising the operational readiness and capabilities of the SAF. National Service remains the backbone of the SAF and maintaining the motivation and morale of our National Servicemen will continue to be our focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 10<I>Public Support and Consultation</I>. MINDEF will continue to seek feedback and consult Singaporeans through channels such as SAFRA and ACCORD, and the National Education Outreach programme. MINDEF will also be convening RECORD IV in 2005 to recognise the contributions of our NSmen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 11 <I>Total Defence</I>. Total Defence is now more than ever relevant to our citizens, households and businesses as a framework for a comprehensive and coherent national response to the new security environment. MINDEF will continue to promote Total Defence through our national education efforts, to involve all Singaporeans in the defence of our country.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS--><p align=left>Column: 69</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">MR WONG KAN SENG<br>\r\nMinister for Home Affairs</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"left\"><br>\r\n 1 Our continued growth and prosperity depend on having a safe and secure Singapore.

In maritime security, the Police Coast Guard will upgrade its fleet and improve its coastal surveillance and intrusion-detection facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 3 The Singapore Police Force (SPF) will enhance its forensic capabilities by acquiring Rapid DNA Fingerprinting Sensors to be used at crime-sites and building up a Bomb Database to aid investigations into bomb blasts. SPF will also implement an Intelligent Closed Circuit Television system to deter and detect criminal and terrorist activities in public areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 4 The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) will strengthen its response capabilities against the unconventional threats of chemical, biological and radiological agents, improvised explosive devices and \"dirty\" bombs. For greater deterrence, SCDF will develop a system to perform real-time tracking of vehicles carrying dangerous goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n  <p align=left>Column: 71</p> 5 Through our National Critical Infrastructure Assurance programme, we will improve the surveillance, protection or hardening of our critical systems and ensure their continued performance in a crisis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>MAINTAINING LAW &amp; ORDER</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6 SPF\u2019s Special Operations Command troops will enhance their capability to respond to incidents of mass protests, riots and other crisis situations. The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) will evaluate alternative screening techniques to detect the consumption of controlled drugs. Enforcement efforts will be intensified to deal with the rising incidence of synthetic drug abuse. A new treatment and rehabilitation regime will be introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 While tightening laws against terrorists and criminals, MHA will relax regulatory controls where feasible, to provide more opportunities for businesses and individuals. For example, SPF will review its requirements so that more public entertainment outlets will be allowed to operate 24 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>IMMIGRATION POLICIES</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8 ICA will introduce new initiatives such as online visa applications to facilitate the easier entry of visitors. It will also review its immigration policies to encourage foreigners who can contribute to sink their roots here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>CREATING A MORE INCLUSIVE SOCIETY</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 A key thrust in creating more opportunities for Singaporeans will be in helping repentant inmates and ex-offenders re-integrate into society. The Singapore Prisons Service and the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises will build on initiatives such as the Yellow Ribbon project to encourage concrete action by families, neighbours and the community to help ex-offenders. We will encourage more employers to offer them employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 10 We will review our laws to give ex-offenders of minor crimes a new start in life without the impediment of a criminal record, provided they remain crime-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 11 The community, and especially the business sector, will be encouraged to take greater ownership of safety and security issues and play expanded roles. SCDF will inject more realism for their volunteers through table-top exercises to familiarise them with likely crisis scenarios and their corresponding roles. A new National Civil Defence Cadet Corps will be launched to enhance students\u2019 civil defence skills and knowledge.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--HIDDEN_TITLE_NAME:ADDENDA, PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE (NATIONAL SECURITY)--><p align=left>Column: 71</p> \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence, Prime Minister's Office (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"center\"><B>PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE (NATIONAL SECURITY)</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">DR TONY TAN KENG YAM<br>\r\nDeputy Prime Minister and<br>\r\nCo-ordinating Minister for Security and Defence</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p> 1 The National Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS) through its two agencies \u2013 the National Security Coordination Centre (NSCC) and the Joint Counter Terrorism Centre  <p align=left>Column: 73</p> (JCTC) \u2013 coordinates strategic planning, policy formulation and capability development in security and intelligence to cope with the threat of transnational terrorism.

We will implement relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions, and examine which UN Anti-Terrorism Conventions should be ratified and which regional and bilateral legal instruments are necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Singapore as a legal services and arbitration hub</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 5 MinLaw will further develop Singapore as a legal services hub, and will continue to enhance recourse to alternative dispute resolution. Arbitration and mediation have increasingly emerged as effective methods of dispute resolution in several industries, for instance, the financial, construction and shipping industries. MinLaw will encourage the formation of more industry-specific panels. Together with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC), we will further promote Singapore as the preferred venue for dispute resolution in Asia by attracting more international conferences and players to Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Community mediation</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 6 At the community level, MinLaw will continue to work closely with agencies to encourage greater use of mediation as the preferred means of resolving social and relational disputes. Through outreach efforts, we will further raise public awareness of community mediation. We will also strengthen the system by upgrading the skills of our volunteer community mediators through ongoing training programmes and accreditation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<B>LAND POLICY</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Efficient, effective use of State land</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 7 MinLaw and the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) will review our land policies to promote efficient and effective use of State land that maximises economic and social opportunities for all. We will continue to review the relevant legislation on land and property, including the Residential Property Act and the Land Acquisition Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 8 We will review policies and legislation so that management of State land is pro-business and pro-community. For short-term commercial tenancies, we will consider allowing existing tenants to renew their tenancies directly on negotiated terms without tender. We will allow more State lands and properties for interim use through a wider range of short-term lease options. We will streamline processes to cut costs and reduce time. In addition, we will work in partnership with the private sector to provide services more cost-effectively, and with the people sector to better serve the needs of the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n <p align=left>Column: 77</p> <B>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>IP to keep pace with trends</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n 9 MinLaw and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) will ensure that our IP framework keeps pace with international and domestic developments.
