Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our trade\r\n\r\nrelations with Indonesia are satisfactory and are  best\r\n\r\nreflected in the fact that, despite an eight-cent  drop\r\n\r\nin   the  average  price  of  rubber,  our  trade  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  last  year,  when  the  final  figures   are\r\n\r\npublished,  is  expected  to total  $1,300  million  in\r\n\r\nvalue - only  one  per cent less than in  1957.  To  have\r\n\r\nmaintained  trade at this level in the  face  of  three\r\n\r\nsuccessive years of lower average rubber prices, namely\r\n\r\nfrom  144.16  cents in 1955 down to 96.76 cents,  88.75\r\n\r\nand  80.18  cents in 1956, 1957 and 1958  respectively,\r\n\r\nis, to say the least, remarkably gratifying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the available January/November trade\r\n\r\nfigures  as  a basis for an estimate, we find  that  in\r\n\r\n1958 imports from Indonesia should total approximately\r\n\r\n$968  million - a shortfall of 12 per cent compared with\r\n\r\n1957.  However,  the actual volume of  rubber  imported\r\n\r\nrose to 311,000 tons from 287,000 tons in 1957. Imports\r\n\r\nof other important produce items such as copra, coffee,\r\n\r\ntea  and pepper tended to fluctuate and may, when final\r\n\r\nfigures   are  available,  be  found  to  have  reached\r\n\r\nslightly lower levels than in 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the export side, I am glad to say that final\r\n\r\nstatistics are likely to show that exports to Indonesia\r\n\r\nlast  year rose to over $360 million-an increase of  47\r\n\r\nper cent over the 1957 figure. Largely responsible were\r\n\r\nincreased exports of rice (up approximately 61,000 tons\r\n\r\nto  163,000 tons), cotton textiles (up $7.5 million  to\r\n\r\n$20.3  million) and art silk piecegoods (up $44 million\r\n\r\nto  $54.9 million). A number of other export items made\r\n\r\nsmaller but significant gains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the comparatively depressed commodity\r\n\r\nposition,  this  picture  is  highly  satisfactory  and\r\n\r\nreflects the factual state of our trade relations  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia. I may perhaps be pardoned, Sir,  if  I  take\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to state that the level of trade with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  might not have been so satisfactory  had  it\r\n\r\nnot  been for the constant vigilance and assistance  of\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry, of which the general public is not aware,\r\n\r\nbecause  we cannot publicise each and every  matter  we\r\n\r\ntake up or each and every assistance we render.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need dwell on the domestic\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  Indonesia.

Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, with your permission, I will\r\n\r\ntake  Questions 6 and 7 together because both refer  to\r\n\r\nthe   same   subject.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of four rice\r\n\r\nAssociations  together  with  representatives  of   the\r\n\r\nChinese Chamber of Commerce saw me on 7th January  with\r\n\r\na request for unconditional abolition of the stockpile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I explained to them that the Government had no desire\r\n\r\nto  carry  the  burden  of the stockpile,  but  it  was\r\n\r\nnecessary in the interest of the general public to have\r\n\r\nguaranteed supplies in case of any emergency.  I  asked\r\n\r\nthem for suggestions as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  any  practical alternate machinery  that  could  be\r\n\r\ndevised to meet this difficulty.

I suggested that such\r\n\r\nbank  guarantees  should total to a tonnage  of  25,000\r\n\r\ntons. This method would not place any additional burden\r\n\r\non  any of the merchants nor on the public while at the\r\n\r\nsame time ensuring that stocks will be available in  an\r\n\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some discussion, though all were agreed that the\r\n\r\nsuggestion   had   possibilities  in   principle,   the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the rice Associations  desired  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss further in their own Associations the practical\r\n\r\naspects of implementing the suggestion and promised  to\r\n\r\nlet  me know the results.

I quote, Sir, part of  my  statement\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Hansard  of  the meeting  on  13th  August,\r\n\r\ncol.566:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...Government will therefore commence taking\r\n\r\nimmediately all such steps as are necessary  for  this\r\n\r\npolicy to be implemented.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to a question asked by the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  after I made this statement, I answered  that\r\n\r\nthere   are  two  forms  of  protection;  one  is   by\r\n\r\nquantitative restrictions and the other is by tariffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 3\u00bd months had elapsed before I was able to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a Bill to implement the policy as announced\r\n\r\nby  me  on  the 13th August. Trade circles  knew  full\r\n\r\nwell,   and  so  did  industrial  circles,  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy had been declared  for  selective\r\n\r\nprotection  to needy industries and that the  Minister\r\n\r\nhad  in  this House committed the Government to taking\r\n\r\nsuch actions as were necessary to implement the policy\r\n\r\nof  the  Government. The implementation of such policy\r\n\r\nwould  entail getting the necessary powers  to  impose\r\n\r\nprotective  duties,  because I had  indicated,  in  my\r\n\r\nreply  to the hon. Member for Tanglin, that protection\r\n\r\nwas   a   two-fold  measure,  either  by  quantitative\r\n\r\nrestrictions or by tariffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd  yet, Sir, over the three and a half months  that\r\n\r\nelapsed between my announcement on 13th August and 3rd\r\n\r\nDecember,   when  I  introduced  the  Bill   and   its\r\n\r\nsubsequent publication, there was no hue and cry  from\r\n\r\nthe  Chambers of Commerce. Neither were tears shed  in\r\n\r\nthis  House. Neither was a motion moved in this  House\r\n\r\nagainst   the   Government's   policy   of   selective\r\n\r\nprotection. Nor even did any hon. Member in this House\r\n\r\ncare  to  raise  the  matter on  the  adjournment.  In\r\n\r\nDecember, when I moved the First Reading of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nto acquire the necessary powers, and when the Bill was\r\n\r\npublished,  suddenly we found protests and  agitation.\r\n\r\nThese  protests and agitation were based on two  types\r\n\r\nof  opposition. The first type of opposition was  from\r\n\r\nthose   who  agreed  on  the  principle  of  selective\r\n\r\nprotection  for needy industries, but who were  afraid\r\n\r\nof  the  manner  in which the Bill was drafted,  which\r\n\r\ngave   the  Government  (not  the  Minister   as   was\r\n\r\nsuggested)   absolute   powers,   unconditional    and\r\n\r\nunfettered.  The  second type of  objection  was  from\r\n\r\nthose who were against the principle of protection  as\r\n\r\nsuch,  because they feared that the free port  statues\r\n\r\nwould be killed and that Singapore would lose its free\r\n\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will deal with the first objection. I\r\n\r\nsympathise  with their viewpoint that  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  not,  under  a democratic  system,  be  always\r\n\r\nallowed  to  have  unfettered  powers.  I  am  not   a\r\n\r\ndictator, Sir, neither have I a desire to be one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Nor the Opposition!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar had the opportunity - I am sure he  is  a\r\n\r\nbudding  dictator - he would set himself up to  be  one.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am only interested in achieving my objects,\r\n\r\nas announced by me on the 13th August, for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, and my objects are (I am quoting  again\r\n\r\nfrom the Hansard of 13th August):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Government recognises that entrepot trade will always\r\n\r\ncontinue  to play a major part in our economy  and  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  determined that the operation of protection\r\n\r\nshould be carried out with the minimum possible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndamage  to,  or dislocation of, the entrepot  trade.  I\r\n\r\nwish to make it very clear therefore that the operation\r\n\r\nof  protection  is  envisaged on a  strictly  selective\r\n\r\nbasis:  that  is,  only where the benefit  accruing  to\r\n\r\nSingapore through the industry concerned outweighs  any\r\n\r\npossible   harm  to  the  entrepot  trade.   Under   no\r\n\r\ncircumstances  will  the  operation  of  protection  be\r\n\r\nallowed to interfere in any way with the entrepot trade\r\n\r\nin  produce,  processed produce  and  textiles  or  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, Sir, when these objections were raised, I saw that\r\n\r\nif  it could be possible to give these exact safeguards\r\n\r\nas  were announced in my policy statement, perhaps  the\r\n\r\nobjectors who were objecting to the undefined powers of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  might  then  reconsider  their  stand.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I announced in the newspapers  that  I  was\r\n\r\ngoing to move such amendments and those amendments  are\r\n\r\nbefore  the  House  today, and I  shall  move  them  in\r\n\r\nCommittee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of objections, Sir, are from those who\r\n\r\nare  afraid that the free port status of Singapore will\r\n\r\ncease and that we will lose free trade. Sir, free  port\r\n\r\nstatus  is  not  a \"paper\" status. It is  not  a  legal\r\n\r\nstatus  defined under any law of the Colony.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nfactual  status, a status obtained through the flow  of\r\n\r\ntrade,  through  Government administrative  actions  of\r\n\r\nminimising  restrictions, and so on. But  there  is  no\r\n\r\nlegal \"paper\" free port status as such. There might  be\r\n\r\npeople  who might say that the Customs Ordinance  is  a\r\n\r\nrevenue  Ordinance, and therefore that  safeguards  the\r\n\r\nfree  port status. I would say that is wrong,  Sir, If\r\n\r\nyou  really  have a free port, you have the  unfettered\r\n\r\nright  to  trade  in  any  item without  duty,  without\r\n\r\nquantitative restrictions on the import or  the  export\r\n\r\nof   any   goods,  without  restriction   on   currency\r\n\r\nremittance  and so on. Now, what have we got?  We  have\r\n\r\nthe  Customs  Ordinance which provides  for  duties  on\r\n\r\nthree  items - tobacco, liquor and petroleum.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  unfettered law in the Customs  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwhich  says  that  no  duty shall  be  imposed  because\r\n\r\nSingapore is a free port. It does not recognise that as\r\n\r\na free port. Once you have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimpinged upon the free port status by imposing duty  on\r\n\r\nany  one  type of goods, then your free port status  is\r\n\r\ngone, the \"paper\" status of the free port is gone. Then\r\n\r\nbeyond   that,   we   have  the   import   and   export\r\n\r\nrestrictions.  The Control of Imports and  Exports  law\r\n\r\nallows prohibitions or restrictions to be placed on the\r\n\r\nimport  or  export  of  any goods.  That  again  is  an\r\n\r\nimpingement on the supposedly legal \"paper\" status of a\r\n\r\nfree  port.  Further,  we  have  the  Foreign  Exchange\r\n\r\nRegulations.  Sir, I think the real fear they  have  is\r\n\r\nthat  free  trade may be killed. I admit  that  if  any\r\n\r\ngovernment  tries to play about with any of such  laws,\r\n\r\nas  I  stated,  it  could kill the  entrepot  trade  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, Sir, given an assurance in my statement on\r\n\r\n13th  August  that  it was not the  intention  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment to tamper with the entrepot trade  and  that\r\n\r\nprotection  would  be  given on  a  strictly  selective\r\n\r\nbasis. I have shouted this from my room in the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  the  Press,  and in this House to the  Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  many a time. If there are those  who  do  not\r\n\r\nwish to accept it, I cannot help it. But I do warn that\r\n\r\na  future  government could, by administrative  action,\r\n\r\nkill the entrepot trade, if it wished. Therefore, it is\r\n\r\nup to the people to choose their government rightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the point of free trade, Sir, even now we do\r\n\r\nnot have free trade, really free trade.

The rich man\r\n\r\nwho  wants to buy a Rolls Royce pays only 10 per  cent.\r\n\r\nThat  is in accordance with our understanding with  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom as part of the Commonwealth to accord  a\r\n\r\npreferential rate of duty to Commonwealth countries. We\r\n\r\ncannot  remove it unless we get out of the Commonwealth\r\n\r\nand get out of G.A.T.T. and various other international\r\n\r\nobligations  to which we are committed. I  do  not  say\r\n\r\nthat it is beneficial for us to get out. Perhaps it  is\r\n\r\nbeneficial  for us to remain, because,  in  return,  we\r\n\r\nmight get some benefit.

We\r\n\r\nare  in  such an economic plight today that we have  to\r\n\r\nconsider each and every case on its merits. If  we  can\r\n\r\nassist  one  factory  to employ ten  more  persons,  we\r\n\r\nshould do our very best to do so, provided the benefit,\r\n\r\nas  I  have said, accruing to Singapore is greater than\r\n\r\nthe  loss.  Sir, I have already quoted my statement  on\r\n\r\n13th  August  in  which I said  that  it  was  not  the\r\n\r\nintention of the Government to tamper with the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade as far as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another fear expressed - that the duties\r\n\r\ncould   be  imposed  on  the  people,  especially   the\r\n\r\nmerchants, without  previous  warning,  and  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  impose these duties  as  and  when  it\r\n\r\npleases.  Sir, perhaps  the  persons  who  make   this\r\n\r\ncriticism are not aware of my Press statement  on  27th\r\n\r\nAugust.  1958.  I do not control the Press,  Sir,  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  I  cannot guarantee whether this  statement\r\n\r\nwas  published  in  1010 factually or  whether  it  was\r\n\r\npublished   in  part,  and  therefore  gave   a   wrong\r\n\r\nimpression. But here it is for what it is worth - this is\r\n\r\npublic   property.  I  quote,  Sir,  from  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment Press statement, INFS. AU. 98/58  CKL  dated\r\n\r\n27th August:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"At a Press conference this afternoon, Mr Jumabhoy\r\n\r\nsaid  two  persons  would be drawn from  the  Panel  to\r\n\r\nconsider  each  application for protection.

The gist of\r\n\r\nthe   application  would  then  be  gazetted  so   that\r\n\r\ninterested  parties  could make representations  either\r\n\r\nfor or against, to the Committee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>A  perfectly democratic procedure.

The   Committee  will  then   make   their\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to me and I will then take  it  to  the\r\n\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There is no Cabinet yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Again,  Sir,  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nreiterate  what  I have said in my statement.  I  shall\r\n\r\nread it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Under no circumstances will the operation of\r\n\r\nprotection be allowed to interfere in any way with  the\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade  in  produce,  processed  produce   and\r\n\r\ntextiles or raw materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will also have to be satisfied that any\r\n\r\nprotection  granted  will not be abused  and  that  the\r\n\r\nundertaking  concerned is operating or is  expected  to\r\n\r\noperate  in  an  efficient manner and  that  protection\r\n\r\nwould not result in the continued marketing of goods of\r\n\r\ninferior quality at excessive prices by comparison with\r\n\r\nthe standards and prices of similar imported goods.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is not clear, I do not know how clearer\r\n\r\nit  could  be  made.  I  am no master  of  the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage,  as the Member for Tanjong Pagar is  when  he\r\n\r\nsays  that  if only you will use Malay as the  national\r\n\r\nlanguage then the Malays will feel closer to you. He is\r\n\r\na master in the English language. I hope the Englishman\r\n\r\nfeels closer to him because he knows English well!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we come to the basic question why protection is\r\n\r\nnecessary.  I  have often said that the entrepot  trade\r\n\r\ncannot  expand  to  the extent where it  could  provide\r\n\r\nemployment  for  a fast increasing population.  Colonel\r\n\r\nLyle,  the expert we have from Canada under the Colombo\r\n\r\nPlan, has something to say about this in his Report.  I\r\n\r\nshall quote the relevant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nportions of the Report which is tabled in this Assembly\r\n\r\nand which has already been published in the Press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the need for industrialisation, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Industrialization is necessary for two major reasons:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to meet the present and future unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to increase or endeavour to hold the present\r\n\r\nstandard of living by manufacturing instead of\r\n\r\nimporting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then he goes on to say-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Those in public life who ignore it or who emphasize\r\n\r\nlesser issues\", -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>that is the growing population issue-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"represent a real danger to this community, in my\r\n\r\nopinion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And then he goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To those who declare that Singapore's economic future\r\n\r\ncan,  as  in  the  past, rest safely  in  the  entrepot\r\n\r\nactivities  of its free port, I ask, 'What  would  have\r\n\r\nhappened in Hong Kong if its people had been content to\r\n\r\nrely  solely on that philosophy when the refugees  were\r\n\r\npouring in by hundreds of thousands?'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>At page 25 of the Report, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A brief comment on the impact of the Government's new\r\n\r\nProtection  Policy on the Entrepot Trade  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nappears to be called for. The general alarm which seems\r\n\r\nto generate is not warranted, in my opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then at page 31 he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The unrestricted Free Port Era appears to be ended.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the natural economic pattern of Malaya can\r\n\r\nbe  restored  and Singapore can retain its well  earned\r\n\r\nplace  as  its  cultural,  commercial,  industrial  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  centre, there is no reason  why  the  second\r\n\r\nchapter in its history cannot be even brighter than the\r\n\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then,  Sir,  he  says  at  page  5  on  the  increasing\r\n\r\npopulation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This complete disruption of the evolutionary pattern\r\n\r\nwill have drastic consequences on Singapore with 50 per\r\n\r\ncent of its population under 21 years of age and with a\r\n\r\n4  per cent annual population increase. All these young\r\n\r\npeople  must  be assimilated in some way (approximately\r\n\r\n100 per day.)\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And on the need for industrialisation to overcome this\r\n\r\nproblem he says at page 14:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I believe that the tables, in themselves,\"-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The population table-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"clearly point out the necessity of industrialisation.\r\n\r\nThey point out that out of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n472,000   employed  in  Singapore  only   185,000   are\r\n\r\nproductive workers; that the remaining 287,000 are non-productive workers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  field  for  agricultural productive employment  is\r\n\r\nlimited by the small amount of land available.  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid   this   very   often   here.   Industrialisation,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  appears to be the only hope  for  the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority of these young people. And at page 15 he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The experience of all Western countries in the past\r\n\r\ntwenty-five  years has proven that the modern  'Welfare\r\n\r\nState' can be maintained in no other way than through a\r\n\r\nhigh standard of productivity in its people.\"\r\n\r\nand so on. That report is enlightening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will quote certain up-to-date trade figures\r\n\r\nwhich  show  the  other danger as regards  the  trading\r\n\r\ndeficits.  The  visible  trading deficit - the  invisible\r\n\r\nfactor would presumably be constant every year,  so  we\r\n\r\nneed  not  worry about that - for 1955 was $83.6 million;\r\n\r\n1956, $365.4 million; 1957, $504.3 million; 1958 up  to\r\n\r\nNovember, $559.7 million. The gap is increasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the pundits who advocate a free port and free\r\n\r\ntrade  will  not see the light. I have nothing  against\r\n\r\nfree trade. I support it. I will fight if anybody tries\r\n\r\nto damage the entrepot trade. It is not my intention to\r\n\r\ndo that. But whilst safeguarding the entrepot trade,  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  open up a second base for our economy through\r\n\r\nindustries.  There was a suggestion in  this  morning's\r\n\r\nStraits  Times editorial that it is possible  we  might\r\n\r\nwrap up the industry in cotton wool. Those are not  the\r\n\r\nexact  words.  But it forgets what I have said  already\r\n\r\nthat   efficiency  will  be  looked   for,   and   that\r\n\r\ninefficiency  will not be tolerated in  the  protection\r\n\r\npolicy. I do not know what the next government will do,\r\n\r\nbut if I were returned again in the next government,  I\r\n\r\ncertainly would not operate this law haphazardly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a certain section of the trading population\r\n\r\nwhich  advocates that a Commission should be set up  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate Singapore's economy and to report  on  what\r\n\r\nis  to be done and so on and so forth. They go back  to\r\n\r\nthe International Bank Report which says that Singapore\r\n\r\nmust retain its free port status.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Singapore is not a completely free port. I\r\n\r\nhave  made  that  clear. Anyhow,  these  are  delaying\r\n\r\ntactics. A Commission composed of outsiders would  not\r\n\r\nknow as much as the people here would know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, even the International Bank Mission Report\r\n\r\nwas  based on one basic foundation, and that is Malaya\r\n\r\nas  one  economic  unit. If you take  that  foundation\r\n\r\naway,  the  whole structure of the recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthat Report collapses, because the presumption is that\r\n\r\nMalaya  will remain as one economic unit. If  that  is\r\n\r\nso,  we  need  not  have  any protection  because  the\r\n\r\nsurplus  population  here can be  sent  to  Malaya  to\r\n\r\nsettle  down on the land, and that is the end  of  our\r\n\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to give a guaranteed market to a\r\n\r\nbudding  industry even if the market is small, because\r\n\r\nif  the investor knows that he can depend on a certain\r\n\r\namount  of  the market for his products, then  he  can\r\n\r\nbuild  on  that  foundation and cater  for  an  export\r\n\r\nmarket.  But  if he has no basic market, even  however\r\n\r\nsmall it is, he dare not invest any money here. It  is\r\n\r\nnow  a  well-known fact that there is quite a  lot  of\r\n\r\nlocal  capital available and that foreign  capital  is\r\n\r\nnot  going  to be easy to attract what with  the  past\r\n\r\nhistory  of  political  and labour  unrest  which,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar will  disown\r\n\r\nand  will  hate  to see a recurrence of.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  other  attractions  that  are  being\r\n\r\noffered   in   other   capital  importing   countries.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  have  to  build  first  on  our  local\r\n\r\ncapital,  and  local capital is predominantly  trading\r\n\r\ncapital.  The  local  people are not  well  versed  in\r\n\r\nindustry, and therefore, unless they can get something\r\n\r\nupon  which to base their industry, they will not dare\r\n\r\nto venture into new fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that was raised this morning in the\r\n\r\npapers   by  the  Secretary-General  of  the  Liberal-Socialist Party was that we have no mandate. Sir, when\r\n\r\nI  was  returned  on  the  Labour  Front  ticket,  our\r\n\r\nprogramme to the people was this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Labour Front will encourage the local people to\r\n\r\nenter  into such secondary industries and small trades\r\n\r\nby giving them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstate protection. The Labour Front will emphasize  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  these industries and trades  for  the\r\n\r\nexport market.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This was presented to the people before the elections,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  quite  clear that  state  protection  was\r\n\r\nmentioned  and  that  the Labour Front  would  provide\r\n\r\nprotection. That is the mandate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> There was no mandate to change your\r\n\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I am not competent to enter\r\n\r\ninto  a political argument with the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  because he is very clever in the  use  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  language and also in shifting from one  point\r\n\r\nto  another,  shifting his ground as frequently  as  a\r\n\r\nchameleon changes its colour. However, coming back  to\r\n\r\nthe  point  in  hand. Recently in the  Straits  Times,\r\n\r\nthere  appeared a cartoon in which I was  depicted  as\r\n\r\nstanding  on  a  pedestal which Sir  Stamford  Raffles\r\n\r\noccupies in front of the Town Hall controlled  by  the\r\n\r\npresent  City  Council. Sir, I cannot aspire  to  that\r\n\r\nhonour,  nor  do  I have any desire to  stand  on  the\r\n\r\npedestal  of a master builder of the British  colonial\r\n\r\nempire,  as  Sir Stamford Raffles was. But one  cannot\r\n\r\ndeny  that  Sir Stamford Raffles was a man of  vision,\r\n\r\neven  though the Member for Tanjong Pagar may like  to\r\n\r\ndeny  it. He saw in this, tiny swampy island a central\r\n\r\nplace  to  serve  a  vast  hinterland,  not  only  the\r\n\r\nhinterland  of the Federation of Malaya but  also  the\r\n\r\nhinterland  of the rich spice islands of what  is  now\r\n\r\nknown   as   Indonesia  and  of  silks  in  the   vast\r\n\r\nsubcontinent  of  China and of the  other  surrounding\r\n\r\ncountries.  He  also saw, in those days when  shipping\r\n\r\nwas  not  developed to the extent as it is now, that\r\n\r\nthe flow of commerce could be expedited and smoothened\r\n\r\nif there was a City port which could act as the outlet\r\n\r\nfor the rich spices and silks of these rich countries.\r\n\r\nThese  could  then enrich the chests of  the  European\r\n\r\nmerchants.  Therefore,  as a result  of  this  vision.\r\n\r\nSingapore was developed into a vast port which  served\r\n\r\na  vast  hinterland. But I submit that no race and  no\r\n\r\nera  has  a monopoly of men of vision. Even today,  we\r\n\r\nhave  the  hon.  Member for Tanjong Pagar  who  has  a\r\n\r\nvision of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  a P.A.P. empire in this tiny  island  to\r\n\r\nreplace the British Colonial Empire!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what all this\r\n\r\nanticipation, as to what the Member for Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nis going to do, has anything to do with this Bill. Let\r\n\r\nus try and be relevant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, when he starts winking at me\r\n\r\na little, I feel like responding - on a friendly basis!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one must admit, Sir, that however far-sighted a man is, his vision is perforce limited by\r\n\r\nthe  horizon. Therefore, anything that goes beyond the\r\n\r\nhorizon  is mere conjecture. Now. Raffles saw in  this\r\n\r\ntiny  swampy  island  a central  place  to  serve  the\r\n\r\nhinterland  of Indonesia, China, Malaya,  and  so  on.\r\n\r\nWhen  he  thought that merchants from all  over  these\r\n\r\nareas  could  converge and engage  in  commerce,  that\r\n\r\nvision  built  up  a very big port here.  But  Raffles\r\n\r\ncould  not  visualise  that  the  alien  people,  from\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  India,  China and  even  as  far  away  as\r\n\r\nArabia, would one day settle down here and then demand\r\n\r\nthe  right  to govern themselves, while his  own  race\r\n\r\nremained  alien to the island. Just as  he  could  not\r\n\r\nvisualise that happening, he could not visualise  that\r\n\r\nthis  vast  hinterland, for which this port served  as\r\n\r\nthe  outlet  would  one day dwindle  away,  and  would\r\n\r\nbecome   independent   countries,   with   independent\r\n\r\neconomic  policies, and therefore the  port  would  be\r\n\r\nleft  without a hinterland. Any child - you need not  be\r\n\r\nan  expert in economic affairs - can understand that  a\r\n\r\nhinterland  is  necessary  for  a  port.   Without   a\r\n\r\nhinterland, a port is useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we cannot blame these surrounding countries for\r\n\r\ndrifting  away  from us, because  it  is  inherent  in\r\n\r\nindependence.  I  do not blame the Federation.  It  is\r\n\r\ninherent in political sovereignty to look after  one's\r\n\r\nown  interests first, and not the interests of others;\r\n\r\nand  if  the  Federation, by exercising that  inherent\r\n\r\nright,  looks after its own interest, we cannot  blame\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is we who are finding ourselves in an unfortunate\r\n\r\nposition, that though in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe past we have been of service, our services are not\r\n\r\nrequired  to  the same extent today and  will  not  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to the same extent in future. Neither  could\r\n\r\nSir  Stamford Raffles visualise that this  island  and\r\n\r\nthis  port,  which was built to serve commerce,  would\r\n\r\none  day become the habitat of a vast population  that\r\n\r\ncould  grow  to  the  extent that commerce  could  not\r\n\r\nprovide for them. Neither could he visualise that this\r\n\r\nisland,  which  was to serve commerce, could  one  day\r\n\r\nbecome  a  political entity and that  commerce  should\r\n\r\nserve  the  island  and  not  just  the  island  serve\r\n\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish the people of Singapore would realise the\r\n\r\ndanger they are facing. I do not know whether I  could\r\n\r\ndivulge them, Sir, but various actions are proposed by\r\n\r\nthe  surrounding governments to cut Singapore away bit\r\n\r\nby  bit.  Today  they impose duty  on  one  thing  and\r\n\r\ntomorrow  duty on another - all for their own interests.\r\n\r\nWe cannot blame them for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, all these are supposed to be secrets.\r\n\r\nI do not really see why they should be secrets. We have\r\n\r\ninherited the British administrative system  which  we\r\n\r\nare carrying on at this moment, and which we hope will\r\n\r\nnot  carry  over after the new Constitution comes  in - that  a lot of \r\n\r\nthings which are treated as secret need\r\n\r\nnot be secret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I wish the people will take my word for it, that\r\n\r\nI  am  aware  of what is happening, and that  is,  the\r\n\r\neconomic future of Singapore is going to be worse  and\r\n\r\nworse if we are not going to do something about it.  I\r\n\r\nhave  no  love for restrictions of any sort.  I  am  a\r\n\r\nmerchant.  I  love  free enterprise.  But  when  other\r\n\r\ncountries  take  actions  which  have  the  effect  of\r\n\r\nrefusing us their markets but keeping our market  open\r\n\r\nto  them, then comes the time when one has got to take\r\n\r\ncounter acticn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the E.C.A.F.E. conference in Kuala Lumpur early\r\n\r\nlast  year,  I  put up this proposal and I  reiterated\r\n\r\nthis   again  in  Seattle,  Washington,  when  I   was\r\n\r\nthere - spending public funds, as the Member  for  Telok\r\n\r\nAyer will always wish to bring home to me - but doing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuseful  work, I contend. I put this suggestion strongly\r\n\r\nas  I  had no prepared speech. I was really furious  at\r\n\r\nthe  way  the  discussion was going on,  with  no  real\r\n\r\neffort being made by any of the nations to come to  any\r\n\r\nsolution  of the issue. They just refused to  recognise\r\n\r\nthe  issue and laid it aside. I hit out, Sir,  and  the\r\n\r\nlooked and nodded at me. I do not know whether he liked\r\n\r\nme  to  hit out or not. But the general impression  was\r\n\r\nthat this puny man from a tiny island which is not even\r\n\r\nan   independent  country,  has  dared  to  tell   them\r\n\r\nsomething.  But  afterwards,  I  received  a   lot   of\r\n\r\ncongratulations.

This  is\r\n\r\npertinent to the question we are discussing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The tendency now is to increase national production in\r\n\r\nevery   industrial  field  and  to  export   to   other\r\n\r\ncountries, but to keep out the industrial production of\r\n\r\nother  countries,  a  policy  which  is  good  for  the\r\n\r\nparticular nation perhaps which adopted it,  but  which\r\n\r\nis  bad  when  considered on a regional basis  and  the\r\n\r\nrepercussions that could follow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the E.C.A.F.E. meeting which was mentioned by\r\n\r\nthe  distinguished representative of New  Zealand,  Mr\r\n\r\nWalter Nash, in Kuala Lumpur early this year. I put  up\r\n\r\na  strong plea for some sort of machinery to be set  up\r\n\r\nby the E.C.A.F.E. Committee to consider the possibility\r\n\r\nof learning the lessons of the European Free Trade area\r\n\r\nand  trying to do something along those lines  for  the\r\n\r\nSouth and South-East Asian regions. I am sorry that  my\r\n\r\nplea  fell down and. Singapore not being a full member,\r\n\r\nI  was  not able to put up a motion. I was hoping  that\r\n\r\nsome  other  nation would do so but that hope  did  not\r\n\r\nmaterialise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened is that the countries are driven to\r\n\r\ncome to this co-operation when they find conditions are\r\n\r\ngetting  worse  and worse. But there  is  no  voluntary\r\n\r\neffort  to do something about it before conditions  get\r\n\r\nbad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, Sir, do put up a plea that we should realise that\r\n\r\nthe world has become too small a place for a nation  to\r\n\r\nstand  by  itself politically or economically.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat if we could realise that well enough, we might  be\r\n\r\nable  to avert disasters which might follow because  of\r\n\r\neconomic  disbalance and disparities between countries.\r\n\r\nAfter  all, wars have been fought in many cases because\r\n\r\nof economic disparities. I may be pardoned for speaking\r\n\r\nout my mind frankly on this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubject,  but  I feel rather strongly on this.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthere is no use shadow boxing on this subject. We  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  recognise  this  and  come  to  some  sort  of\r\n\r\nunderstanding about it. Consultations do not cut across\r\n\r\npolitical sovereignty and E.C.A.F.E. might be  able  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  some  machinery for regional consultations  in\r\n\r\nthe  economic development field without infringing upon\r\n\r\npolitical sovereignty. Just consultations and voluntary\r\n\r\nacceptance or non-acceptance of the result. It might be\r\n\r\na  good  way  out. And yet there will be  something  to\r\n\r\nassist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after making this impassionate plea - which was\r\n\r\nnot recorded on paper until after I had made the speech \r\n\r\n- what  happened? No country was prepared to talk  about\r\n\r\nany  consultation in the economic field. All they  were\r\n\r\nafter was, \"I will do what suits me best\", and that was\r\n\r\ntheir  decision. In the Assembly last month,  I  stated\r\n\r\nthis  is a cold hard competitive world and we have  got\r\n\r\nto  fight to survive. It is no use the hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar and his Party's economic pundits writing\r\n\r\nvarious   articles  in  their  magazine  and   in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, crying loud to convince the public, because\r\n\r\nthey feel they can get power next year, and saying, \"We\r\n\r\nshall   have  no  political  disturbances,  no   labour\r\n\r\ndisturbances. Foreign capitalism is not  so  bad  after\r\n\r\nall.\" Two years ago the Member for Tanjong Pagar turned\r\n\r\nround to Mr Sutherland and said: \"You wait!\" They were\r\n\r\nthe  ones  who  were against the capitalists.  \"Foreign\r\n\r\ncapital is not so bad after all. We must try to  induce\r\n\r\nforeign  capital  to come.\" I have got  the  quotations\r\n\r\nhere.  They dare to challenge me! I shall give a  reply\r\n\r\nto  all  these  quotations - that we must encourage  and\r\n\r\ninduce foreign capital to come in and, in fact, we must\r\n\r\ngo  down on our knees to foreign capital.

But what is important in a Minister  is\r\n\r\nnot  being clever and intelligent, but being  wise  and\r\n\r\nsound and practical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said no one bothered to oppose his policy\r\n\r\nstatement  which he made in August last year,  when  he\r\n\r\nannounced  his  policy of protection. Probably  it  was\r\n\r\nbecause  nobody  took the Minister seriously,  because,\r\n\r\nhaving  seen  his past performance, they  doubted  very\r\n\r\nmuch,  first,  whether he would ever get  on  with  it,\r\n\r\nsecondly, whether he ever had the time to get  on  with\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have passed two major Bills this morning and\r\n\r\nthis  is  the third major one. There is hardly time  or\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  the Minister and  his  Government  to\r\n\r\nbring  into fruition any of the plans which these three\r\n\r\nBills  have sought to embody. The curious feature about\r\n\r\nthis   Government  is  that,  unlike  other   socialist\r\n\r\ngovernments  which come out with a spate of legislation\r\n\r\nafter their first year of office, they come out with  a\r\n\r\nspate of legislation in their last few weeks of office,\r\n\r\nknowing  full  well  that they are no  more  than  just\r\n\r\ntalking points; knowing full well that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno  businessman, no merchant and no industrialist  will\r\n\r\nbase  their actions on the basis of pious protestations\r\n\r\nand  legislation of a government which is  on  its  way\r\n\r\nout.  If he wants to know why nobody pays the slightest\r\n\r\nattention  to him, it is because everybody  knows  that\r\n\r\nwhat he says does not count.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is the P.A.P. stand on the free port\r\n\r\nstatus?  Briefly it is this: that whilst  we  recognise\r\n\r\nthe  changing facets of our economy and the economy  of\r\n\r\nthe  surrounding territories, primarily  Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya, we do not think it is either\r\n\r\nwise or prudent to have any sudden switches in economic\r\n\r\npolicy.  Whilst we do not oppose what the Minister  has\r\n\r\ntermed   \"selective  protection\"  of   industries,   we\r\n\r\nrecognise  quite clearly and bluntly that the Singapore\r\n\r\nmarket  consists  of one and a half million  souls  and\r\n\r\ncannot   provide  that  attraction  to  big  industrial\r\n\r\ncapital.  We  can give protection to 1.5  million.  The\r\n\r\nFederation can give protection to 7 million. Therefore,\r\n\r\nif our industry is to flourish, it must be on the basis\r\n\r\nof  higher  skills,  low costs and intense  competitive\r\n\r\neffort.  Whilst it may be necessary to give  protection\r\n\r\nin  the  initial stages, ultimately whether or  not  an\r\n\r\nindustrialised  Singapore will  come  into  being  will\r\n\r\ndepend  upon the basis of the skills and techniques  of\r\n\r\nits workers and its managerial class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister deplored the outcry against him. He\r\n\r\ncould  have saved himself all this trouble if,  instead\r\n\r\nof  having  to  quote Press statements to which  nobody\r\n\r\nbothered  to  pay any attention, he had from  the  very\r\n\r\nbeginning  indicated  his  intention  on  the   subject\r\n\r\nmatters on which he considered protection feasible.  He\r\n\r\nknew  full  well  that,  in the course  of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee hearings on the Control of Manufacture  Bill,\r\n\r\nthere  were  very  few industries  indeed  which  could\r\n\r\nprofit  by such protection. And by introducing  a  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich could have been and was, in fact, construed as an\r\n\r\nattempt to give blanket protection for all commodities,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the draftsmanship of the Bill, he was  just\r\n\r\ninviting trouble upon himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one feature which the Minister has not\r\n\r\ntouched  upon, and that is the rapidity with  which  he\r\n\r\nrecoils  in  the face of criticism. The trouble,  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  it,  is  that too many  clever  things  are\r\n\r\nthought  out  in haste, spoken out even before,  as  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  they  are  put  down on  paper,  get  accurately\r\n\r\nquoted,  and  properly sloshed up,  and  then  a  quick\r\n\r\nretraction  and withdrawal is made. If  from  the  very\r\n\r\nbeginning  he  had stated quite clearly  that  what  he\r\n\r\nwanted  to do was what he now says he is going  to  do,\r\n\r\nwith  the amendment which he seeks to introduce, a  lot\r\n\r\nof  unnecessary debate both in the Press  and  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly would have been saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.40 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

I quote the first page:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Colony and the Federation enter into an\r\n\r\neconomic partnership in which both would enjoy the same\r\n\r\ncommon  market  and  the same tariff  protection,  that\r\n\r\ngranting the same inducements to new industry  and  the\r\n\r\nsame  incentives for the expansion of existing industry\r\n\r\nthey could, together, achieve an outstanding measure of\r\n\r\nindustrial development.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, I will quote what our Hon.

The Minister has\r\n\r\nbrought out this Customs (Amendment No. 3) Bill mainly\r\n\r\nin  order  to  counteract the measures  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation   Government  to  attract  the  established\r\n\r\nindustries  of Singapore, which are moving across  the\r\n\r\nCauseway, and also to attract new investments  thereat\r\n\r\nthe expense of Singapore. This is indeed a very tragic\r\n\r\nsituation. We all realise that in partnership, if  not\r\n\r\nin   union,  we  can  achieve  a  greater  measure  of\r\n\r\nindustrial progress than in separation or in  rivalry.\r\n\r\nIt  is  therefore  very strange  that  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment,   instead   of  pursuing   a   policy   of\r\n\r\nfriendship,  could embark on a policy  to  counteract,\r\n\r\nand  if  Singapore brings out a measure to  counteract\r\n\r\nthis policy it will be the complete destruction of the\r\n\r\neconomic future of both countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the history of the world, we cannot recall\r\n\r\nany  case where a country has so adamantly refused  to\r\n\r\njoin  or  accept another country which is economically\r\n\r\nand financially well off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen many countries which went to war - very\r\n\r\nexpensive wars - for the sake of a few acres of land.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not understand why the Federation refuse to accept\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Sir, we cannot explain this as  a  pacific\r\n\r\nattitude  of the Federation, because they  are  really\r\n\r\nentering  into very damaging economic warfare  against\r\n\r\nSingapore. It could not be that they are frightened of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  population, so that if they joined  with\r\n\r\nSingapore, their economic future would be involved and\r\n\r\ngreatly damaged?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is the case, both countries could keep\r\n\r\ntheir  political identities and form only an  economic\r\n\r\nunion, whereby Federation can keep its economy and, at\r\n\r\nthe same time, have a trade agreement with Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only possible explanation, as I can see it, is\r\n\r\nthat  there are some powers behind this move. Probably\r\n\r\nsome S.E.A.T.O. power has given directions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  instructions to the Federation Government to  have\r\n\r\nnothing to do with Singapore, because they are  afraid\r\n\r\nthat  is Singapore and the Federation come to a  union\r\n\r\nor  a  merger,  it  is possible that  both  will  join\r\n\r\ntogether and have a strong foreign policy. Out of this\r\n\r\nforeign  policy  there will possibly  come  industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment, and they might ask the S.E.A.T.O. powers\r\n\r\nto  take  the  military base from  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  So  it  is  in  the  interests  of  those\r\n\r\nS.E.A.T.O. powers to make Singapore and the Federation\r\n\r\nweaker and weaker. To do this, they want Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe Federation to be apart. They must have no union at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not know what secret agreement the\r\n\r\nFederation   had   when  they   were   granted   their\r\n\r\nindependence. It might be that one condition was  that\r\n\r\nthey  should  object to any merger with  Singapore.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  see  any  other reason for Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation   not  joining  together.  The   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  also  realise, as does the  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  that  by  separation  and  rivalry,   both\r\n\r\ncountries'  economy is going to be ruined.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  why the Federation are so adamant that  a  union\r\n\r\nmust not be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Hon. Minister for Commerce and Industry\r\n\r\nhas  said,  Singapore cannot exist  without  depending\r\n\r\nupon a hinterland for its trade. But we have seen  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government refusing to take us in spite  of\r\n\r\nall the pleas and all the discussions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only alternative for us to exist is to join with\r\n\r\nsome  other country. I mean Indonesia. Sir,  Indonesia\r\n\r\nis our next neighbour with which we have been carrying\r\n\r\non  a substantial volume of trade for many decades. It\r\n\r\nis  a  country with a population of 19 million  people\r\n\r\nand  has  enormous natural resources. By merging  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  our  trade would expand  very  greatly  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  industries would, instead of moving  across\r\n\r\nthe  Causeway  to  supply a population  of  6  million\r\n\r\npeople, remain here and enlarge production to supply a\r\n\r\nmarket of 90 million people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, let us not worry too much over the fact\r\n\r\nthat  our  existence is entirely at the  mercy  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government and, consequently, our  salvation\r\n\r\ndepends  entirely  on  waging a  tariff  war  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.50 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister just\r\n\r\nnow  said  that it was not the intention of the  Labour\r\n\r\nFront  Government to damage the free  trade  status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and he went on to show the hon.  Members  in\r\n\r\nthis  House a Labour Front election platform to provide\r\n\r\ntrade  protection. It is very strange that it is  after\r\n\r\nnearly  four  years  that the  Government  saw  fit  to\r\n\r\nintroduce such legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, the introduction of these\r\n\r\nmonopolies  or tariffs will benefit only a few  but  it\r\n\r\nwill cripple the free port status of this country.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  went on to elaborate on the free port  status\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  by  informing  us  why  the  Government\r\n\r\nformerly introduced quotas and restrictions. It is  his\r\n\r\nduty  to  find  ways and means to abolish that  system.\r\n\r\nQuotas  can  be  bought locally. Everyone  knows  that.\r\n\r\nPeople  who  do things legitimately never benefit  from\r\n\r\nthese  quotas.  Sir, Government should  find  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans to protect the people here. They say, \"We want to\r\n\r\nprotect  a  few  industries.\"  I  am  not  against  the\r\n\r\nprotection of industries if they provide employment for\r\n\r\nour people, but do not put tariffs on any goods. I want\r\n\r\nto  find  out  whether the tariffs will also  apply  to\r\n\r\ngoods coming from the Federation. I am not against  the\r\n\r\nprotection of industries. But Government should, in the\r\n\r\nfirst  place, encourage local industries; provide  them\r\n\r\nwith  machinery  and  technical men,  rather  than  put\r\n\r\ntariffs  on  the  goods  they  manufacture.  What  will\r\n\r\nhappen? If a merchant wants to import goods from  other\r\n\r\ncountries  and  you have these tariffs, the  Government\r\n\r\nwill have to provide go-downs to store these goods  for\r\n\r\nexport to other countries. That will involve money  and\r\n\r\nwill encourage corruption and smuggling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can bring any of the cigarette vendors in\r\n\r\nSingapore today to this House to confirm this - you  have\r\n\r\nimposed  a tariff and a duty on cigarettes and yet  you\r\n\r\nfind  cigarettes with the chop \"For Export Only\" (which\r\n\r\nmeans  for export and kept in bond) being sold back  to\r\n\r\nour  people all over Singapore. I am very unhappy about\r\n\r\nthis.  Only  after  four years have  the  Labour  Front\r\n\r\nGovernment shown that it will enforce trade protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Minister went on to say that a small island\r\n\r\nlike Singapore must have a hinterland. I do not quarrel\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation. We must co-operate economically.\r\n\r\nEven  the  report of Mr Lyle says that  you  must  co-operate - \"joint economic co-operation\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at Hongkong. We have a big country like China\r\n\r\nnext  to  Hongkong and yet Hongkong manufacture cheaper\r\n\r\ngoods than China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hongkong today have 3,300 factories. They have no\r\n\r\nhinterland. Their goods are exported not only to China,\r\n\r\nbut  also  to Malaya, Singapore, Borneo and  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nWhy  cannot the Government do that instead of  imposing\r\n\r\ntariffs and talking about quotas? Regarding quotas, may\r\n\r\nI  point  out  to  the Minister that I was  formerly  a\r\n\r\nGovernment   servant?  Quotas  were  imposed   on   the\r\n\r\ninstructions of Whitehall. Even motor-cars, which  have\r\n\r\na  preferential duty, are protected. These instructions\r\n\r\nall  come  from  Whitehall, in spite of the  fact  that\r\n\r\nSingapore earns more dollars than any other country  in\r\n\r\nthe Commonwealth. It is up to us to take it up with the\r\n\r\nauthorities in Whitehall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year we approved a big sum of money to be\r\n\r\nprovided  for tourism. It is the Government's  duty  to\r\n\r\nencourage  tourism.  Tourists  come  to  this   country\r\n\r\nbecause  we have a free port status. They want to  come\r\n\r\nand  buy cheap goods rather than dear goods. They  also\r\n\r\nwant  to buy those goods which they cannot get in other\r\n\r\ncountries.   Now  by  introducing  tariffs,   you   are\r\n\r\nencouraging smuggling and corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M.

Sir, this is a most\r\n\r\ndangerous Bill which changes the whole policy  of  free\r\n\r\ntrade  which has existed since over a century. Sir,  no\r\n\r\none  in  Singapore will object to giving protection  to\r\n\r\nindustries  or  some selected industries  in  order  to\r\n\r\nprovide  employment for our people. But there are  ways\r\n\r\nand means to do so, and not all of a sudden bring about\r\n\r\na complete change of economic policy in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister said that he had announced this in\r\n\r\nAugust  1958,  but Singapore knows very well  that  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government is going out and that no  attention\r\n\r\nwill  be  paid to what they say now. Sir, the  Minister\r\n\r\npresented to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  this  morning  a Labour Front  pamphlet  stating\r\n\r\ntheir policy before or after the elections. May I  ask,\r\n\r\nSir,  are  they members of the same Party to  whom  the\r\n\r\nvoters  gave  their  votes  and  got  them  into   this\r\n\r\nAssembly?  Definitely they are not! They have  betrayed\r\n\r\ntheir voters by leaving their Party, and the Party  was\r\n\r\nelected  to  power by the voters. In other  words,  the\r\n\r\nLiberal-Socialists were right when they said that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment have no mandate from the people.  Sir,  they\r\n\r\nhave  deserted  their Party or changed their  Party  or\r\n\r\nleft  their  Party. Now they are out to kill  Singapore\r\n\r\nitself - employers and employees - by this Bill. They have\r\n\r\nbeen  in  power  for over 3\u00bd years. Where  were  their\r\n\r\nideas  all this time? Could they not have thought about\r\n\r\nthis,  say, after one year or two years in office  that\r\n\r\nthis is needed and that is needed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has developed - I emphasise the word\r\n\r\n\"developed\" - from  a  fishing  village  to  the  present\r\n\r\nprosperous  city  because of  its  free  trade  policy.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  position is quite unique  and  one  cannot\r\n\r\ncompare  it with any other country. It is a  city  with\r\n\r\none  and a half million people only. You cannot compare\r\n\r\nit  with India, Pakistan or any other country. In  many\r\n\r\nrespects,  Hongkong  differs from Singapore.  Hong-Kong\r\n\r\nsells its manufactured goods to the hinterland and  re-exports  goods  to other places. It gets raw  materials\r\n\r\nfrom  the  hinterland  or  from  elsewhere.  Its  chief\r\n\r\nfeature   is  cheap  labour.  So  one  cannot   compare\r\n\r\nSingapore  with  Hongkong or  with  any  other  places.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  in a unique position by  itself.  It  is\r\n\r\nstrategically situated. Its geographical  position  has\r\n\r\ncontributed  to  its importance as an entrepot  trading\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the argument was put forward that our population\r\n\r\nis increasing. Of course, population is also increasing\r\n\r\nin  the surrounding countries. The Minister quoted only\r\n\r\nthe  1955,  1956  and  1957 trade figures.  What  about\r\n\r\nearlier  figures?  The volume of  trade  has  increased\r\n\r\nsince  1936-1938, but that does not mean that we should\r\n\r\nnot  encourage our local industries. But there are ways\r\n\r\nof going, about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether the Government have ever studied\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Trade Commission Report,  1932-34.  The\r\n\r\nCommission sat for two years almost every day. It  went\r\n\r\nthrough all the aspects of trade concerning the Straits\r\n\r\nSettlements.  Singapore  is in  no  different  position\r\n\r\ntoday. Have they given any thought to that Report?  All\r\n\r\nof  a  sudden,  they come out with a Bill changing  the\r\n\r\nwhole policy of free trade in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has not got any hinterland. That is a\r\n\r\nfact.  Yet  another  fact is that  it  has  no  natural\r\n\r\nresources  or  raw  materials. How are  our  industries\r\n\r\ngoing  to  exist then? We have to import raw materials.\r\n\r\nThe  only thing we have is labour - at a high cost.  Then\r\n\r\nwhat  are  we  to  do?  We must  create  efficiency  in\r\n\r\nindustry.  Sir, suppose a tariff is imposed on  pencils\r\n\r\nand  they  are  sold  at  ten  cents  each,  and  other\r\n\r\ncountries are selling the pencils at eight cents  each.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, the 1\u00bd million people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  have to buy pencils at a higher price. That means\r\n\r\nwe are increasing the cost of living. Everything should\r\n\r\nbe  done with a view to the overall economic benefit of\r\n\r\nSingapore. That is very important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by imposing tariffs or by restricting these goods\r\n\r\nfrom  entering Singapore, you are penalising the  whole\r\n\r\npopulation  to  buy  goods at a higher  rate.  That  in\r\n\r\nitself  is  a drawback. It injures the entrepot  trade.\r\n\r\nAfter all, our industries will be providing for only  1\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion  people.  Can  we  re-export  goods  to   other\r\n\r\ncountries  at competitive rates? If we can,  we  should\r\n\r\nbring  our  industries to that level. Then tariffs  are\r\n\r\nnot necessary at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in any case, this Bill should not be passed for\r\n\r\nthe reasons given by me. The life of the Government  is\r\n\r\nvery  short.  They have only two months to go.  Nothing\r\n\r\ncan  be  implemented  at present by  them  and  nothing\r\n\r\nshould be done in haste. The Government have not stated\r\n\r\nwhether this Bill is to be referred to Select Committee\r\n\r\nor a Committee of the whole House. This is an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant  Bill.  To change a policy existing  for  140\r\n\r\nyears  in  a  rush will bring nothing but harm  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether there is anyone on the\r\n\r\nGovernment side with trade or industrial experience. If\r\n\r\nso,  I  will be happy to hear the length of  time,  the\r\n\r\nline  of  business and the volume of trade in which  he\r\n\r\ndeals.   Sir,   the  Chambers  of  Commerce   and   the\r\n\r\nManufacturers' Association have been built by those who\r\n\r\nhave done hard work to establish trade and industry  in\r\n\r\nthis  country.  These organisations  have  existed  for\r\n\r\nyears  and  years  and their experience,  guidance  and\r\n\r\nadvice should be sought first. Have they been consulted\r\n\r\non  the  proposed  change  in the  economic  policy  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?  Even a man with experience  in  trade  will\r\n\r\ncertainly not go against these bodies as they represent\r\n\r\nthe  whole  trade of Singapore. I do not  know  whether\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is  to  be committed to a Select  Committee\r\n\r\nwhere public opinion can be sought or whether it  is\r\n\r\nto  be rushed through. No statement on this has so  far\r\n\r\nbeen  made, but if it is to be rushed through, it  will\r\n\r\nbe  suicidal for Singapore. That will be a sad state of\r\n\r\naffairs.  Of  course, the voters did not  realise  that\r\n\r\nthey were electing the wrong people to the Assembly who\r\n\r\njust  want to throttle trade. Here assurances are given\r\n\r\nthat  certain commodities will not be interfered  with.\r\n\r\nWhat  guarantee is there that commodities will  not  be\r\n\r\ninterfered  with  one by one? Are we  to  take  it  for\r\n\r\ngranted. Sir? That reminds me of my Budget speech.  The\r\n\r\nprevious  Government handed over $200  million  to  the\r\n\r\npresent Government and only $83 million is now left. We\r\n\r\nhad  very  little  taxation then.  Petrol  and  tobacco\r\n\r\nprices have now gone up by 40, 50 and 60 per cent.  Who\r\n\r\nhas  to  foot the bill? The taxpayers! That  is  a  sad\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs and I hope the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nrealise that they should have a Government which is  at\r\n\r\nleast interested in their welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have got Mr Lyle's Report. This has been\r\n\r\nquoted in the Assembly. I have a copy here with me. One\r\n\r\nmay not agree with all the recommendations, but it is a\r\n\r\nvery  important Report. In summing up, he says on  page\r\n\r\n32:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I believe that the formation of a Joint Industrial\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Council,  guided  and  supported  by   the\r\n\r\nConsulting  Services of a world known firm like  Arthur\r\n\r\nD.  Little  Inc., could prove to be the rallying  point\r\n\r\naround which economic union could be achieved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a very important suggestion. Of course,\r\n\r\nMr  Lyle  has  mentioned throughout  his  Report  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  cannot  stand alone  industrially  and  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  a  joint economic  policy  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. All means should be explored  to\r\n\r\nensure  the  possibility of coming to  terms  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya in the interest of both  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  Federation  of Malaya. After  all,  Singapore\r\n\r\ngeographically was and still is part of the  Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya.  I  have  seldom said  anything  about  the\r\n\r\nFederation  in  this  Assembly,  because   it   is   an\r\n\r\nindependent country. We axe a Colony now and even under\r\n\r\nthe  new constitution Singapore will still be a Colony.\r\n\r\nA lot of people talk about merger. My opinion about the\r\n\r\nmerger is that it will come about when the British  are\r\n\r\ncompelled by the surrounding Asian nations to  give  up\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Then the Federation of Malaya  will  accept\r\n\r\nus. There is no harm if the Federation accepts us as  a\r\n\r\ntenth  or twelfth State with a limited number of  seats\r\n\r\npossible on the Federal Council. That stage might  come\r\n\r\nabout  much later because the countries surrounding  us\r\n\r\nare  now  too busy with their own affairs. I would  not\r\n\r\nsay that political merger is possible at present, but I\r\n\r\nwould say that economic merger is a possibility. So all\r\n\r\nmeans  should be explored to bring about the  formation\r\n\r\nof  a Joint Industrial Development Council. If that  is\r\n\r\nnot possible, then I suggest we can have our own Board.\r\n\r\nWe can try that out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we fail after doing all these things, then\r\n\r\nthere is no other alternative but to impose tariffs. If\r\n\r\na few selected industries want protection by tariff, we\r\n\r\ncan  grant them tax holidays instead. Why can that  not\r\n\r\nbe  done instead of changing the whole economic  policy\r\n\r\nof  Singapore? There are also other means  besides  the\r\n\r\nimposition  of  tariffs,  for  example,  reliefs   from\r\n\r\nelectric power, water, and so on. The Government  might\r\n\r\nsay that that is not in their hands but in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCity  Council's  hands.  You can  always  bring  in  an\r\n\r\nOrdinance to that effect to help the people.  Have  all\r\n\r\nthese  means  been  explored? You want  to  change  the\r\n\r\npolicy all of a sudden and you want to do that when the\r\n\r\nlife of the Government is about to end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a lot of research work is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the hon.

Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this morning I was\r\n\r\non  the Lyle Report and its recommendation, and I  said\r\n\r\nthat the first step should be to endeavour to have this\r\n\r\nJoint Board on Pan Malayan Industrial Planning, and  if\r\n\r\nthat  fails, then Singapore goes on its own.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, a lot of research is necessary before jumping to\r\n\r\nthis Bill, thus ruining the established economic policy\r\n\r\nwhich has done so much good to Singapore, that is,  the\r\n\r\nfree  trade policy. Sir, the Report has also  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  representatives  of the  Government  and  experts\r\n\r\nshould  sit on this Board - an expert means not  a  dummy\r\n\r\nbut one who knows his job - and not political friends  or\r\n\r\npeople  with  no experience of the particular  type  of\r\n\r\nindustry or any industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Commerce and Industry suggested this morning that there are Import and Export Control\r\n\r\nRegulations,  Foreign  Exchange  Control  Regulations,\r\n\r\nduties on cars, and so on. If those regulations exist,\r\n\r\nwhy  should  this Bill not be passed and entrusted  to\r\n\r\nthe  care  of  the Government? Sir, these  are  flimsy\r\n\r\nexcuses. Just because these controls exist, this  Bill\r\n\r\nshould  therefore be passed and the whole trade policy\r\n\r\nshould   be   changed.  One  should  not  forget   the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Councillors in the postwar  period -  some\r\n\r\nwere  necessities after the war; some were necessities\r\n\r\nduring  the  Korean  war. The main  thing,  until  the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution came in, is that  no  elected  or\r\n\r\nnominated  Member  was in charge of a  portfolio,  and\r\n\r\nthat  also,  as a whole, they were in a minority.  The\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  running the government was conducted  by\r\n\r\nthe  officials. But the Labour Front Government had  a\r\n\r\nchance  to  scrap  this if they  thought  this  was  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  regulation. But they have not done  it,  and\r\n\r\nthey have not done it because they want something more\r\n\r\non the same lines. It is disgusting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, something was mentioned about the free countries\r\n\r\nand  their policies. As I said before, we are  just  a\r\n\r\nColony. We will still remain a Colony, and there is no\r\n\r\ncomparison between Singapore and any other country  or\r\n\r\nany  other  city in the world. We should  compare  our\r\n\r\npeculiar  position  with that of other  countries  and\r\n\r\nadjust  it;  but on the other hand - I may just  make  a\r\n\r\npassing  remark - where are the free  countries  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  and  how  many?  Does  he  mean  non-Communist\r\n\r\ncountries or otherwise? Most of the countries in South-East  Asia  are controlled or influenced  by  American\r\n\r\ndollars,  and  I  do  not  see  that  they  are   free\r\n\r\ncountries.  We  have been influenced  by  one  or  the\r\n\r\nother, but nevertheless we will be free to govern  our\r\n\r\ninternal affairs under the new Constitution, and  then\r\n\r\nthe  government  should plan what  is  wanted  by  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore and for their benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mention was made about Sir Stamford Raffles and\r\n\r\nhis  vision.  I  wonder whether it was necessary.  The\r\n\r\nfree  trade  policy laid down by him has  subsequently\r\n\r\nsucceeded. Whether he had visualised what would happen\r\n\r\nand  how  the  population would  increase  or  not  is\r\n\r\nanother  matter, but I think the same principle  still\r\n\r\nremains   good.  And  if  it  is  good,  whatever   is\r\n\r\nestablished,   let   it   continue   till   the   real\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the people  are  elected  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  and they will then plan what they  think  is\r\n\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my colleague the hon. Member for Tiong Bahru\r\n\r\nmentioned  corruption. It has  been  admitted  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Commerce and Industry at the last  Budget\r\n\r\nsitting  that corruption exists in his own  department\r\n\r\non  the  stockpiling  of rice. He also  mentioned  how\r\n\r\ncigarettes  were being sold, and four  new  industries\r\n\r\nwanting  duties,  bonded warehouses, establishment  of\r\n\r\ndepartments,  and so on. No doubt there will  be  some\r\n\r\ncorruption.  Why  go  to all this trouble?  What  for?\r\n\r\nUnless  you  have  exhausted all your resources,  then\r\n\r\nthere is no other way. But ways have not been tried at\r\n\r\nall.  It  is  a Bill brought before this  House  in  a\r\n\r\nhurry,  and the Government want it to be passed  in  a\r\n\r\nhurry. Sir, if the Government wanted to help the small\r\n\r\nman,  instead  of  wasting  the  taxpayers'  money  in\r\n\r\ntravelling, they  could have paid more  attention  at\r\n\r\nleast  to small-scale and cottage industries from  the\r\n\r\nvery  beginning  because these could give  employment,\r\n\r\nbut they have neglected their duty throughout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government have any particular industry\r\n\r\nin mind to help - by modern machinery, expert knowledge,\r\n\r\nand  other  necessities - and if such means still  fail,\r\n\r\nthen try other means but not till then. The free trade\r\n\r\npolicy  should be considered on the economic basis  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  not  in  the  interests   of   a   few\r\n\r\nindustries. You will be increasing the cost of  living\r\n\r\nof  the whole population instead of lowering it. It is\r\n\r\na vicious circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I might say that this is a Bill of\r\n\r\ngreat  importance.  The  very existence  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ndepends on it and it should not be rushed through. It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould be scrapped like the Luxury Tax Bill. There  are\r\n\r\nthree  reasons, Sir, and they are these.  Firstly,  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government have no mandate  from  the  people,\r\n\r\nbecause they are not the elected representatives of the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front,  especially the  four  or  five  elected\r\n\r\nMinisters of the Labour Front Government. They have  no\r\n\r\nbusiness  to  bring about this Bill without  a  mandate\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people. Secondly, they cannot  implement  it\r\n\r\neven  if they pass it, because in only two months' time\r\n\r\nthey  will  not  be  there  anymore;  they  should  not\r\n\r\nrepresent  the  interests of the people  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThirdly, if at all these novices insist on getting this\r\n\r\nBill  through, it is advisable, Sir, that it should  be\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  a  Select  Committee  where  advice  and\r\n\r\nguidance  could be sought from the Chambers of Commerce\r\n\r\nwhich  have  worked  for a hundred years  now  in  this\r\n\r\nColony.  What  they have to say may  help  these  small\r\n\r\nindustries, which the Minister might have in mind;  but\r\n\r\nto rush the Bill through is nothing but madness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to express my support\r\n\r\nfor  the  principle of this Bill which is,  of  course,\r\n\r\nbound  to  come  under  attack  from  some  people   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a stone outside the Treasury building, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, on a patch of grass just across the river from\r\n\r\nFullerton Building - a handsome obelisk erected  in  1850\r\n\r\nin  commemoration  of the visit of the Governor-General\r\n\r\nof India, Lord Dalhousie - and many a keen free trader in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  will,  I  am  sure,  spend  a  luncheon\r\n\r\nadjournment in studying the fairly lengthy essay carved\r\n\r\non the sides of that in four languages-the first multi-lingualism a hundred years ago - Chinese, Malay, English\r\n\r\nand  Tamil,  I  think.  That  inscription  records  the\r\n\r\nprofound  conviction of the traders of  Singapore  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  lives by free trade. It was erected  in  the\r\n\r\nbrief  interval  between  the first  and  second  Opium\r\n\r\nWars - the  first  Opium War of 1839-40  and  the  Second\r\n\r\nOpium War of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1855-56 - I  forgot the exact date. That represents  what\r\n\r\nyou might call the long tradition of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But times change, the world changes. Then free trade\r\n\r\nwas  the  free trade of Western industries seeking  new\r\n\r\nmarkets  throughout  the  world.  Now,  industries  are\r\n\r\ndeveloping   world-wide  and,  to  some   extent,   the\r\n\r\ncountries newly developing have an advantage  over  the\r\n\r\ncountries  which did their developing earlier  and  are\r\n\r\ncommitted to a lot of out-of-date equipment very often.\r\n\r\nThat pattern of free trade is not wholly an appropriate\r\n\r\none   today.   I  give  no  support  to  the   economic\r\n\r\nnationalism  which  does so much  harm  in  the  world,\r\n\r\nalmost  as  much  harm as military  nationalism.  These\r\n\r\nnationalisms are out-of-date. A man should be loyal  to\r\n\r\nhis  own country, the place where he lives and has  his\r\n\r\nhome  and  his work. But he should also recognise  that\r\n\r\nall  countries  form part of the world pattern,  and  I\r\n\r\nmost  fully  support what my colleague and friend,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Commerce and Industry, said at Seattle,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  was,  about the need for countries  to  stop\r\n\r\nthinking  in terms of their own backyards and to  start\r\n\r\nthinking of the world pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free trade traditionally means, in effect, that the\r\n\r\ntrader  wants to be free of unwanted government action.\r\n\r\nTraders  do not resent the government doing  what  they\r\n\r\nwant.  They  run to the government very vigorously  and\r\n\r\nloudly  say,  \"Why have you not done this?\"  when  they\r\n\r\nwant  something done that suits them; but they  do  not\r\n\r\nlike having things done which might limit their profits\r\n\r\nor interfere with their decisions. That is very natural\r\n\r\nand proper. But it is a problem of social organisation.\r\n\r\nI  am  no  trader;  I could hardly be  mistaken  for  a\r\n\r\nmerchant;   but  it  appears  to  me  that   trade   is\r\n\r\nessentially the most primitive of the social  functions\r\n\r\ntoday. The functions of production are rationalised and\r\n\r\nhighly developed. The function of distribution of goods\r\n\r\nis still in a very primitive stage. However, I will not\r\n\r\ntake up the time of the Assembly with that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that this power for\r\n\r\nselective  protection forms only a part of the  general\r\n\r\npattern of policy, and I would like to refer, if I may,\r\n\r\nto  the same Labour Front booklet of 1954 from which my\r\n\r\ncolleague quoted, in which we set out not only our Four-Year  Programme  but  also  our  Principles  and  Aims.\r\n\r\nPrinciple No. 11 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Labour Front regards the exchange of goods and\r\n\r\nservices  between nations as the basis of international\r\n\r\npeace  and internal prosperity.

I presume it does. The\r\n\r\npoint  I  am making is that that was one of the guiding\r\n\r\nprinciples  from  which  our  Four-Year  Programme  was\r\n\r\ndeveloped,  and  on which point 7 of the  programme - the\r\n\r\none  about State protection to small industry - was made.\r\n\r\nWe   recognise  also  that  while  there  would  be  an\r\n\r\nappropriate  field  for  protection  within  Singapore,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,   Singapore's  economic   functions   and\r\n\r\nservices to the world - the services by which we earn our\r\n\r\nliving  and survive - are in the complementary  economic\r\n\r\nsystem  by  which goods and services are exchanged  and\r\n\r\nwhich would mean, of course, the use of Singapore as  a\r\n\r\ncentre  of  exchange, or if you prefer, an entrepot.  I\r\n\r\njust  wish  to make these points, Mr Speaker,  because\r\n\r\nthere appears to me to be some confusion in the use  of\r\n\r\nthe  phrase  \"free trade\", which itself is a  confusing\r\n\r\nphrase and nobody has yet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  define exactly what they mean  by  free\r\n\r\ntrade. I do not suppose you can have trade made free in\r\n\r\nthe  sense  of being free from money costs. You  cannot\r\n\r\ndeal with this problem in these very simple categories.\r\n\r\nYou  will  have  to  have a major objective,  and  then\r\n\r\nwithin  that  you  have to construct detailed  policies\r\n\r\nwhich meet the immediate facts and also serve the long-term future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir Ewen Fergusson -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sir Ewen Fergusson (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  everyone  wants Singapore  to  be  a  hive  of\r\n\r\nindustry with new factories opening every year,  but  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  there must be many who are sorry  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has come to the conclusion that these can be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  open  and  expand  only  by  artificial\r\n\r\nmeasures  and by far-reaching controls, the effects  of\r\n\r\nwhich cannot be judged for a long time to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has mentioned Hong Kong as an example to Singapore, but I know of no tariffs which have been\r\n\r\nintroduced  there  to  encourage the  very  substantial\r\n\r\ngrowth  which  has taken place since the war;  and  the\r\n\r\npresent  measures which are put forward may or may  not\r\n\r\nhelp  us to increase the wealth of Singapore. They  may\r\n\r\nindeed  not  be effective. One feels that  there  is  a\r\n\r\npolicy  of  desperation in the speed with  which  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  are being put forward, and there is no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat the population growth in Singapore is probably one\r\n\r\nof the most frightening problems which must face us. If\r\n\r\nincrease of industry is the aim, it is my opinion  that\r\n\r\nit  should  be  encouraged in  every  way  and  tariffs\r\n\r\navoided in so far as that is possible. And it is not as\r\n\r\nif  Singapore is only a trading centre. It has had very\r\n\r\nlarge  and  growing  factories  for  many  years,  and,\r\n\r\nindeed,   it   has   a  very  thriving   Manufacturers'\r\n\r\nAssociation. Many industries have been very successful,\r\n\r\nthough  others  have failed, but it is a moot  question\r\n\r\nwhether  we  will  really benefit  from  a  process  of\r\n\r\nselective  protection or that it will really solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  our  growing population,  or  indeed  even\r\n\r\nalleviate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recall that in the year 1945, when we came back\r\n\r\nafter the Japanese Occupation, there was a policy paper\r\n\r\nfrom  the  British  Military  Administration  which   I\r\n\r\nhappened  to see. In that paper it was stated that  the\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade  of  Singapore was finished,  and  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  was a dying place. Those of  us  who  had  a\r\n\r\nsight  of  this paper or document criticised  it  very,\r\n\r\nvery  much  indeed. I think the evidence of  the  years\r\n\r\nsince 1945, including the figures which were quoted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the  Minister this morning, shows  that,  if\r\n\r\nanything,  Singapore has grown as a trading centre  and\r\n\r\nthat  its entrepot trade is vastly greater than it  was\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entrepot trade must continue to be encouraged and,\r\n\r\nin fact, it is very little use manufacturing unless the\r\n\r\ngoods   which  it  produces  are  able  to   be   sold.\r\n\r\nManufacturing  can only, in a place like Singapore,  be\r\n\r\ncomplementary  to and party to the entrepot  trade.  It\r\n\r\ncertainly can in no way be a substitute for  it.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that  it is not the intention of this Government,\r\n\r\nor  any  other Government, to do anything  which  would\r\n\r\nrestrict  our  trading  ability,  because  without  the\r\n\r\noverseas  trade which we have got, there will be  fewer\r\n\r\npeople  able  to buy the products of the  manufacturers\r\n\r\nand  the factories which we hope will come steadily  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  over the next few years. But the  contention\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  is that, by artificially  guarding\r\n\r\nsome industries, they will be increasing prosperity for\r\n\r\nSingapore. Only time will tell. What in fact, I  think,\r\n\r\nwe  really need here is a greatly expanding economy but\r\n\r\na greatly reducing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original amendment to the Customs Ordinance meant\r\n\r\nan  overwhelming  change in the  general  structure  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economy.  I  am  not  convinced   by   the\r\n\r\nMinister's argument of what constitutes a free  trading\r\n\r\narea.  All I can say is that the fewer the restrictions\r\n\r\nand  the  restraints, the better,  and  thus  the  less\r\n\r\nopportunity  there  should be  for  the  Government  to\r\n\r\ncreate these artificialities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I conclude by saying that I consider tariffs a bad\r\n\r\nway to encourage local industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure the\r\n\r\nHouse  will  join with me in welcoming the new  Member,\r\n\r\nSir  Ewen  Fergusson, to this House. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\npoint out that this House will, in general, regret  the\r\n\r\nspeech  just  delivered by him. He is,  of  course,  an\r\n\r\nexperienced businessman, and we must also consider  him\r\n\r\na  loyal  citizen,  as a result of which  he  has  been\r\n\r\nnominated a Member of this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we come to debate on this important point of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.  Sir  Ewen Fergusson,  I  think,  is\r\n\r\nmistaken  in  his suggestion that the only solution  to\r\n\r\nour  problem is to expand our economy but to reduce the\r\n\r\npopulation.  I  wonder whether Sir Ewen  Fergusson  has\r\n\r\nfound  time  to  read  through Col.  Lyle's  Report  on\r\n\r\nindustrial  development. If he had, Sir, he  would  not\r\n\r\nhave  delivered his speech, especially as, I  am  sure,\r\n\r\nwith his experience and knowledge he should be able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute more constructive suggestions to this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I too wonder whether the Lyle Report has been\r\n\r\nofficially  reported as Government policy.  If  it  is,\r\n\r\nthen there is something in the second last paragraph at\r\n\r\npage  25, under the title \"Entrepot Trade\", which  most\r\n\r\nof  our  merchants here - Europeans and Chinese alike - are\r\n\r\nvery  much worried about. This is a factor which  might\r\n\r\nkill our entrepot trade. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government's declared Policy is that Protection\r\n\r\nwill  not be granted if the Entrepot Trade in the  item\r\n\r\nconcerned will be seriously affected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And it continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Therefore, the people involved in Entrepot Trade in\r\n\r\nthe  item  concerned should have ample time to  prepare\r\n\r\nand  organize  whatever  new procedure  and  facilities\r\n\r\nmight be required.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder if it is clearly the Government's policy\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  to  pay  special consideration  to  the\r\n\r\nentrepot trade, particularly from Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to go a little bit further on the question\r\n\r\nof  reducing the population of this island. I think the\r\n\r\nonly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway  is  to invite the world powers to drop an  atomic\r\n\r\nbomb!  Indeed  this is the fastest and most  effective\r\n\r\nway  of reducing the population. We spoke quite enough\r\n\r\nin  the debate on the Family Planning Association.  We\r\n\r\nmust  have confidence in ourselves to face the future,\r\n\r\nand  not  be  so  pessimistic as  to  think  that,  by\r\n\r\nreducing  the  population,  we  can  solve   all   our\r\n\r\nproblems.  Sir,  that will not solve our  problems  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now digest the lengthy and learned statement\r\n\r\ngiven  by the Minister for Commerce and Industry  this\r\n\r\nmorning. We can confine ourselves to a few points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Minister assures us that Singapore is not,\r\n\r\nafter all, a free port. This is the first time that he\r\n\r\nhas  made it clear that Singapore is not a free  port,\r\n\r\nas  what other people generally think. But I am  quite\r\n\r\ncertain that in certain Government publications, it is\r\n\r\nstated that Singapore is a free port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In last year's Budget debate, the Minister\r\n\r\nadmitted  that Singapore's entrepot trade  was  dying.\r\n\r\nBut  today he has said that it is not so, and that  it\r\n\r\nis still going strong, or at least it is not dying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Minister for Commerce and Industry has\r\n\r\npromised  that he will do all he can to safeguard  our\r\n\r\nentrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We cannot trace anything at all in connection with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya. I think the main  point  in\r\n\r\nCol.  Lyle's Report is that, for the benefit  of  both\r\n\r\nterritories, Singapore and Malaya, they  must  have  a\r\n\r\nPan-Malayan  economic plan. But  we  cannot  find  any\r\n\r\nindication of this in the Minister's statement today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is one answer to our difficult\r\n\r\nproblems - how to solve unemployment, raise the standard\r\n\r\nof  living  of the people and strengthen our  economic\r\n\r\npotentialities. There is always one answer - wait until\r\n\r\na  merger  with the Federation and then we  can  solve\r\n\r\neverything. But why not mention in the Minister's report\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoday the confidence that the Minister  has  for\r\n\r\ncarrying out a one-sided industrial policy, which is a\r\n\r\nvital  change?  Even the P.A.P.'s  great  leader,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar, has to declare his change of\r\n\r\napproach towards our economic problem. He says that if\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya's and Indonesia's  economies\r\n\r\nremain  the  same  as today, he will not  support  any\r\n\r\nvital  changes in our economic policy. What confidence\r\n\r\nhave  the  Singapore People's Alliance-UMNO  Coalition\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  carrying  out  a  one-sided   economic\r\n\r\npolicy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has even criticised the P.A.P. for always changing its policy. They can oppose the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O.  (Preservation of Public Security  Ordinance)\r\n\r\nand  say,  \"When we are in power we will  support  the\r\n\r\nP.P.S.O.\" Now they oppose the capitalists and cry out,\r\n\r\n\"Down  with  the  capitalists!\" But when  you  are  in\r\n\r\npower,  you  will  need capital  because  Tunku  Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman  needs  capita!  and  Indonesia  needs  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment.   But  what  confidence  do  the   present\r\n\r\nAlliance  Coalition Government have  in  carrying  out\r\n\r\nsuch a policy? Sir, this may save a lot of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I sit down, I want to put two questions. Will\r\n\r\nthe  Government fully accept Col. Lyle's Report  as  a\r\n\r\nbasic  policy  of  Singapore's industrial  development\r\n\r\nprogramme?  Secondly, have they made any  approach  or\r\n\r\nhave they had any consultations with the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya in connection with this Customs (Amendment  No.\r\n\r\n3) Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthree  months ago when the Hon. Minister for  Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry  brought  up the subject  of  having  to\r\n\r\nprotect local industries, thereby infringing upon  the\r\n\r\nfree   port  status  of  Singapore,  I  was  extremely\r\n\r\nunhappy,  and  I had very grave doubts as  to  whether\r\n\r\nsuch  measures  should be made. But on  being  assured\r\n\r\nthat the free port status will be maintained as far as\r\n\r\npossible,  particularly where our  entrepot  trade  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, and that such restrictions would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  confined  only to local industries  which  require\r\n\r\nhelp and protection, I have changed my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And joined the S.P.A.!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Sir, the growing population and\r\n\r\nthe increasing unemployment in Singapore must force us\r\n\r\nto  change our views and accept measures which  up  to\r\n\r\nthe present moment have not been acceptable to us.  We\r\n\r\nare  now  coming to a stage where we have to take  in\r\n\r\neach  other's washings. We cannot afford to live  just\r\n\r\nby  trading  alone. Because of the  number  of  people\r\n\r\nunemployed, we have to supply ourselves with  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  basic  and vital goods which we require  for  our\r\n\r\neveryday  needs, and that is the very purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nprotection  which  is asked for today.  We  have  been\r\n\r\nasked  why  we do not follow the example  of  Hongkong\r\n\r\nwhere  no  protection is required. But then  Hong-Kong\r\n\r\npresents an entirely different picture. There you have\r\n\r\na standard of living among the working people which is\r\n\r\nvery  much below that which has been attained  by  our\r\n\r\nworkers  in this country today. I am sure none  of  us\r\n\r\nwould  want any of our workers to work and live  on  a\r\n\r\nbare  wage  of about two or three dollars a day  which\r\n\r\nthe workman gets in Hongkong now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever we do, Sir, we must look for employment. We\r\n\r\nmust  find  employment.  I  am  sure  the  safeguards\r\n\r\nprovided  for under clause 3 of this Bill whereby  if\r\n\r\nany of the products which are protected meets with the\r\n\r\ndisapproval  of  the  people  of  this   country,   a\r\n\r\nresolution  in this House will take that  away.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that safeguard is adequate and, for that reason,\r\n\r\nI do support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir I\r\n\r\nshould like to answer some of the points raised by Sir\r\n\r\nEwen  Fergusson in support of his opposition  to  this\r\n\r\nBill.  The first point is this: In 1945, the political\r\n\r\nset-up  in  Malaya  was entirely  different  from  the\r\n\r\npolitical  set-up  today. In  1945,  Sir,  Malaya  was\r\n\r\ndivided\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  the  Straits  Settlements, the  Federated  Malay\r\n\r\nStates  and  the  Unfederated Malay States.  And  they\r\n\r\ntogether, Sir, formed one economic unit. There was not\r\n\r\nin  existence  at that time the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nwhich  has  now imposed tariffs on soap imported  into\r\n\r\nthe Federation from Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, he mentioned Hongkong. He\r\n\r\nasked why Hongkong could prosper without tariffs.  The\r\n\r\nanswer is obvious. In Hongkong, labour is so cheap, as\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Paya Lebar has said, that the standard\r\n\r\nof living of certain human beings there is so low that\r\n\r\nwe  in  Singapore would be ashamed to see in  Hongkong\r\n\r\nthe way they live. Labour is so cheap that Hongkong is\r\n\r\nable to produce consumer goods below the price of  any\r\n\r\nsimilar  consumer goods imported into Hongkong.  That,\r\n\r\nSir, is the reason why Hongkong has no tariffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir Ewen's other point, which seems to have been\r\n\r\nshared  by some Members who oppose this Bill, is  that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  if  passed, would  disturb  our  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade.  Why  should  that be  so,  Sir?  The  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  has given us his assurance that  no  tariff\r\n\r\nwill  be  introduced to protect any goods manufactured\r\n\r\nin  Singapore if such tariffs will in any way have any\r\n\r\nadverse effect on the entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us see the advantage of having tariffs\r\n\r\nfor certain selective goods manufactured in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  advantage  is, firstly, that this will  encourage\r\n\r\nthe  expansion  of  existing  industries  and  attract\r\n\r\ncapital,  not  only from abroad, but also  from  local\r\n\r\npeople.  In  my  mind. Sir, we have  sufficient  local\r\n\r\ncapital  for  investment  in Singapore.  This  capital\r\n\r\nlocally   will  come  to  be  used  and  invested   in\r\n\r\nindustries, once the Government protect industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer again to the soap industry, Sir. Many of the\r\n\r\nsoap  industries  in Singapore have  closed  down  and\r\n\r\nmoved  to  the  Federation of Malaya. What  does  that\r\n\r\nmean?  A  flight  of  capital from  Singapore  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, employment - so many people were thrown\r\n\r\nout  of  jobs  because  of the removal  of  these  soap\r\n\r\nfactories.  Sir,  if  the  trade  unions  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nrealise  this  fully, I am sure they will  give  strong\r\n\r\nsupport  to  this Bill. For what I have  said,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nstrongly support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.13 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis morning I expected to hear from the leader of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party  big  plans  on  how  to   help\r\n\r\nSingapore, greater plans to help give employment to the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, and also how action can be  taken\r\n\r\nto  raise the standard of living of the people. But  in\r\n\r\nfact, I heard an absolutely different tale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he said: \"Why do you want to bring up the Bill at\r\n\r\nthis time? The time is too short to implement it. It is\r\n\r\nneither  a wise nor a prudent step to make a change  in\r\n\r\neconomic policy at this time of the day.\" May I ask, in\r\n\r\nsuch  circumstances, what must we  do?  What  does  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar suggest? Fold our arms and  do\r\n\r\nnothing?  Let things drift; let unemployment  increase;\r\n\r\nand  let  the  people go hungry? No, Sir, I  think  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of Singapore must stop thinking about  how  to\r\n\r\nconnect  everything  with  political  propaganda.  They\r\n\r\nshould sit down and consider sanely what would be  best\r\n\r\nfor the people; whether they should come into office or\r\n\r\nwhether  they  should  not  even  be  elected  to  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  I  always think, Sir, that  if  there  is  a\r\n\r\nproblem, there must be a solution. The solution may not\r\n\r\nbe  as good as we want it to be. But as we go along, we\r\n\r\nmay improve on it and we may finally solve the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give an instance, Sir. Today there is the\r\n\r\nproblem of children not being able to get into schools.\r\n\r\nDid  we  adopt the attitude of the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar that just because of the short period before  the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections, we should fold our arms? No, Sir, we\r\n\r\nnever did that. We sat down and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthought   about  it  and  we  solved   it -   at   least\r\n\r\npartially  - by opening new schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, Sir, we know that the entrepot trade\r\n\r\nis not keeping pace with the increase in population and\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  think  of other ways and  means  to  help\r\n\r\nourselves. Today we know that all our people cannot  be\r\n\r\nemployed  in  business houses and that we must  protect\r\n\r\nour  workers. I say that this Bill is only  part  of  a\r\n\r\nscheme  to  help  Singapore to earn a little  bit  more\r\n\r\nmoney  and  to create more employment opportunities.  I\r\n\r\nwas surprised, Sir, to hear from the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  that things should be left as they are. He  said\r\n\r\nthat  if  we  want to manufacture, then we  have  three\r\n\r\npoints  to think about. First, the cost should be  low;\r\n\r\nsecond, we must have more mechanisation; and, third, we\r\n\r\nshould be very competitive. I agree with all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> My recollection is that I never\r\n\r\nenumerated the three points in that order,  nor  did  I\r\n\r\nenumerate  the three points at all.

If you want an efficient industry, you  must\r\n\r\nhave  efficient  workers with the necessary  degree  of\r\n\r\ntechnical  skill  to compete with the cheap  labour  in\r\n\r\nHongkong and China, and sufficient managerial talent to\r\n\r\nmake sure that your costing is down to bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Very well, we will just talk about\r\n\r\nlow  labour costs.

People will  go  without  work;\r\n\r\nindustries will have to fold up; workers will  have  to\r\n\r\ngo  hungry and will have to tighten their belts because\r\n\r\nthere will probably be no more strikes in Singapore.

It  is  not  gentlemanly,  Sir,  just   to   be\r\n\r\nacrimonious.

What\r\n\r\nmatters  is  whether  it  will  act  adversely  on  the\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade of Singapore.

Perhaps\r\n\r\nI  think the Minister had overlooked my speech on  the\r\n\r\nControl of Manufacture Bill during its Second Reading.\r\n\r\nI  then  pointed  out the dangers of quantitative  and\r\n\r\ntariff  controls and how it would affect the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  of  Singapore. I can safely say that nobody  is\r\n\r\nopposing  the  Minister  for introducing  measures  of\r\n\r\nprotection  for  industry, because we  all  know  that\r\n\r\nindustry  must somehow be encouraged or  protected  in\r\n\r\norder  to  supplement our entrepot trade. We  are  all\r\n\r\nagreed  that industry should be encouraged and helped,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  the method of protection which  is  being\r\n\r\nintroduced  that  Members here and  a  lot  of  people\r\n\r\noutside   are  not  convinced  of.  Those   who   have\r\n\r\ncriticised these measures are not necessarily  selfish\r\n\r\npeople   or  traders.  In  fact,  most  of  them   are\r\n\r\nmanufacturers   or  are  interested   in   industries.\r\n\r\nAlthough  I  am  a  businessman,  Sir,  I  myself   am\r\n\r\ninterested  in  the  manufacture  of  products.  I  am\r\n\r\ninterested in rubber and latex factories.  I  am  also\r\n\r\ninterested in many other manufactures. But  the  point\r\n\r\nis  that when we talk of these things, we have to have\r\n\r\nthe  overall picture of Singapore before  us  and  not\r\n\r\njust  talk  of the benefit to one section of industry.\r\n\r\nIt  should  not  be  a question of manufacture  versus\r\n\r\ntrading, or manufacturers versus the merchants, or the\r\n\r\nChambers   of   Commerce  versus  the   Manufacturers'\r\n\r\nAssociation.  This  should not  be  so.  What  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  is the method of protection  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing  introduced  and whether that  method  will,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   bring  about  the  result  that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nenvisages in his Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, first of all, Sir, let us examine what\r\n\r\nindustries  we  can protect. I have  said  that  I  am\r\n\r\ninterested  in rubber factories and some of  them  are\r\n\r\ngoing  out  of business. If I can get protection  from\r\n\r\nthe Minister, I will certainly be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npestering  him, but I realise at once that the  rubber\r\n\r\nmilling  industry cannot be protected because the  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials  come  from elsewhere; it  is  not  produced\r\n\r\nhere. If there are more factories in Indonesia than we\r\n\r\nhave  here,  then naturally they will mill the  rubber\r\n\r\nthemselves  and they will not send over  their  rubber\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  mill.  In our coconut oil  industry,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  we  get  copra from elsewhere.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nproduce  copra  here.  And if  they  had  coconut  oil\r\n\r\nindustries  in  their own lands, they would  certainly\r\n\r\nlike  to mill the copra themselves and not send  their\r\n\r\ncopra  to be milled here. I know that not so long  ago\r\n\r\ncopra  millers were after the Minister for  protection\r\n\r\nand  they  were trying to influence him  to  say  that\r\n\r\nwhatever  copra imported here should be  allocated  to\r\n\r\nthe  coconut mills, and not be re-exported. I think  I\r\n\r\nmust  give  credit to the Minister who,  I  think,  is\r\n\r\ncleverer  than what these people think. Of course,  he\r\n\r\nrefused  to  introduce such a policy  because,  if  he\r\n\r\ntried to do that, then no copra at all would be coming\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore. The question is simply this: are  our\r\n\r\nindustries world competitive or not? If not,  then  we\r\n\r\ncannot get even the raw materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing is this - whatever industries we hope to\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  protect would be very small  industries,\r\n\r\nindustries for home consumption; and protection is  by\r\n\r\ntariffs and quantitative controls. As has been pointed\r\n\r\nout  by everybody, including the Lyle Report, our home\r\n\r\nmarket  is  very small. If we shut out  all  the  soap\r\n\r\ncoming  in, thus allowing the local soap factories  to\r\n\r\nmanufacture  purely  for local consumption,  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  such  a  protection  could  enable  the  soap\r\n\r\nfactories  to survive without any outside competition,\r\n\r\nif  they are wholly dependent on the home market.  The\r\n\r\nimportant  thing  is  to  weigh  the  advantages   the\r\n\r\nindustry derives from these measures and the resultant\r\n\r\nharm done to the entrepot trade by trying to give this\r\n\r\nsmall advantage to the manufacturer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take cigarettes, for instance. You try to establish\r\n\r\na   cigarette  factory  here  and  shut  out  all  the\r\n\r\ncigarettes that come\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin. By doing that - in order to encourage a factory here\r\n\r\nto employ a few hundred people - not only would you lose\r\n\r\nyour  $40  million in revenue, but you would  also  be\r\n\r\npenalising  a  lot  of  people  who  are  trading   in\r\n\r\ncigarettes - perhaps many thousands - in order to benefit\r\n\r\na  few  hundred.  Should  not  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority be considered? In fact, if you have a picture\r\n\r\nof  those people interested in cigarettes - not counting\r\n\r\nonly  the  wholesalers,  retailers,  hawkers - how  many\r\n\r\nwould  you deprive of employment if you were  to  shut\r\n\r\nout  the import of this item in order to preserve your\r\n\r\nlocal  cigarette factory? And, as I said, there is  no\r\n\r\nassurance that people will smoke your cigarettes. From\r\n\r\nwhat  I gather, the dearer type of cigarettes imported\r\n\r\nhave,  in  fact,  a  larger market  than  the  cheaper\r\n\r\ncigarettes.  It  shows that consumers have  got  their\r\n\r\ntastes and their preference. No doubt protection  does\r\n\r\nsome good to the small industry, but is it worthwhile?\r\n\r\nThat is why we are not convinced that this is the best\r\n\r\nway  to do it. We have advocated that these industries\r\n\r\ncould  be  helped in other ways, instead of  tampering\r\n\r\nwith the entrepot trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position, as I see it, is like this. We liken\r\n\r\nSingapore  to a big family. This family has  subsisted\r\n\r\non its own business - a big and prosperous business - and\r\n\r\nthe  whole family has worked in the business. But  now\r\n\r\nthe  family  grows  with the coming  of  children  and\r\n\r\ngrandchildren,  and you see that the  family  business\r\n\r\nalone  cannot offer sufficient employment to  all  the\r\n\r\nchildren  and  grandchildren. Now, the thing  you  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to do is to open up another business in  order\r\n\r\nto  absorb  these growing-up children. Well and  good.\r\n\r\nBut  if, by opening up a new business, you say to  the\r\n\r\nold  business, \"In order to keep me on  my  feet,  you\r\n\r\nmust  sacrifice a few lines for me. You must  not  buy\r\n\r\nthis;  you  must not buy that. You must  not  maintain\r\n\r\nyour own business. You have got to give up a few lines\r\n\r\nfor  me, so that my new business can thrive, and I can\r\n\r\nstand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  my  feet.\" Would that be advisable? If we open  up\r\n\r\nanother  business, it is with the object of  absorbing\r\n\r\nthe  up-and-coming  children. That  business  must  be\r\n\r\nindependent. It must have nothing to do with  the  old\r\n\r\nbusiness,  which must be maintained at all costs.  The\r\n\r\nold  business  must not be sacrificed in  any  way  in\r\n\r\norder  to  put that new business on its own feet.  The\r\n\r\nnew   business   could  be  made  self-sufficient   by\r\n\r\nproviding it with capital, but certainly not by asking\r\n\r\nthe old firm to sacrifice some lines of its business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now an hon. Member said that nobody has\r\n\r\nexplained  why  a free port is important  and  why  it\r\n\r\ncould  be hurt if customs duties were levied.  I  will\r\n\r\nsay  this-much of the value of a free port lies in the\r\n\r\nconfidence of traders both inside and outside it;  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  that  they can trade and plan  in  advance\r\n\r\nwithout let or hindrance. And much of this planning is\r\n\r\ninvisible; it is not everything that catches the  eye.\r\n\r\nAt one time the Minister said that Singapore is not  a\r\n\r\nfree  port,  because it still levies taxes on  liquor,\r\n\r\npetroleum and cigarettes. A free port is just  like  a\r\n\r\nclub.  I think small places which encourage activities\r\n\r\nwill  have some of these vices. For instance,  at  one\r\n\r\ntime there was a monopoly on opium and there was a tax\r\n\r\non  opium. Such places thrive on the nature  of  their\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Monte  Carlo  and Las  Vegas  cannot  scrap\r\n\r\ngambling. Without gambling there would be no activity.\r\n\r\nThey would not attract, because they have nothing else\r\n\r\nto  attract.  In our case, I think, petroleum,  liquor\r\n\r\nand  cigarettes are in the category where people  have\r\n\r\nto  pay tax. One point is that these imports could  be\r\n\r\nvery  conveniently kept in bonded warehouses and taxed\r\n\r\nwhere  it  is for local consumption. There is  no  room\r\n\r\nwhere  you can delineate as a free port area.  You  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  enough  godowns, or storage  space.  To  go\r\n\r\nbeyond these three needs, the goods have to be put  on\r\n\r\nshow before they could be sold. They could not just be\r\n\r\nconveniently kept in the bonded warehouses and all you\r\n\r\nsay  is,  \"I want so many '555' cigarettes,\"  and  the\r\n\r\npeople are supposed to know what they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things, Sir, which a free port does - things\r\n\r\nwhich we cannot understand. It is only the man on  the\r\n\r\njob  who knows what is going on. I would like to quote\r\n\r\nsome of the activities here, the significance of which\r\n\r\nwill  quite mystify hon. Members. Sometime ago  Saigon\r\n\r\nbought  a certain amount of pepper from Singapore  and\r\n\r\nit  was shipped from Singapore to Saigon. We know that\r\n\r\nSaigon  does not consume pepper to that extent and  we\r\n\r\nwere quite right - because, after it went to Saigon,  it\r\n\r\nwent  to  Marseilles, France - and that manner of  trade\r\n\r\ncontinued.  And then we got orders from  Hongkong  for\r\n\r\npepper  and Singapore shipped it to Hongkong. Hongkong\r\n\r\nthen  sent that pepper to Saigon, and Saigon  in  turn\r\n\r\nsent that pepper to Marseilles! What is going on?  Why\r\n\r\nshould  we not be sending pepper to Marseilles direct?\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  possible because the French had committed\r\n\r\nthemselves to buying their colonial produce, and there\r\n\r\nwas  the  duty to be paid for others. Before  the  war\r\n\r\nthere  was a stock of pepper in Vietnam, so the French\r\n\r\nclaimed  that  pepper, which was exported  by  us,  as\r\n\r\nVietnam  pepper  and  it went to  France,  duty  free.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  there are a lot of American cigarettes  in\r\n\r\nwhich  Singapore  dealers have been  dealing,  and  no\r\n\r\nSingaporean  knows  the brands,  because  it  goes  to\r\n\r\nBorneo  where  it is bartered for Philippine  produce.\r\n\r\nThe  trade then was only done by small craft,  but  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as it became profitable both ways, bigger  craft\r\n\r\nwere engaged. The trade expanded. Now that the surplus\r\n\r\nto  the Philippines is bigger the money does not  just\r\n\r\ngo back to the Philippines. It goes to Hongkong, or to\r\n\r\nSingapore, and thence to Hongkong, and then back again\r\n\r\nto  Manila,  because by that process, they  gain  more\r\n\r\nManila  dollars than if they were just to  remit  that\r\n\r\nfrom Borneo to Manila at the official rate. Of course,\r\n\r\nthere  are  the official and the unofficial  rates  of\r\n\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is surprising to see that there are so many\r\n\r\nthings happening which we do not know about in a  free\r\n\r\nport. A free port gives confidence to the traders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  know  they  can  do  anything  without  let   or\r\n\r\nhindrance.  This  confidence  encourages  a   lot   of\r\n\r\nactivity, and these activities are all for the good of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say that this protection does not do any\r\n\r\ngood to industries, but the point is whether that good\r\n\r\nwill  outweigh this good. In fact, to my mind,  it  is\r\n\r\njust  like  trying to remove a mountain to  release  a\r\n\r\nmouse! It outweighs the advantage likely to be gained.\r\n\r\nThe  advantage  is, in fact, very small compared  with\r\n\r\nthe harm that I can see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, hon. Members have dwelt on Hongkong\r\n\r\nmanufactures.  Of  course, that is a different  thing.\r\n\r\nHongkong prospers not because of its home market,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  able to export and compete  with  the\r\n\r\noutside  world.  In fact, they have competed  so  well\r\n\r\nthat  there  have been complaints from Lancashire  and\r\n\r\nthe  United  States and they are now trying  to  limit\r\n\r\nHongkong exports to their place, because U.K. textiles\r\n\r\ncannot compete in their own market with Hong-Kong, and\r\n\r\nAmerican textiles cannot compete with Hongkong in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  also. It is the outside bigger  market\r\n\r\nthat  builds a worthwhile industry. Industries  thrive\r\n\r\nnot  because of their home market. I should  say  that\r\n\r\neven  the Hongkong home market would be too small  for\r\n\r\nsome  of  their  industries, except  perhaps  a  small\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I will say this: since the reading of\r\n\r\nMr  Lyle's report about joint industrial development,\r\n\r\nI  say  that  the only sensible thing to do,  if  only\r\n\r\nbecause  it does not make one work against the  other,\r\n\r\nis to have the two territories with a population which\r\n\r\ncan constitute a joint economic unit for something  to\r\n\r\nbe  done.  The tyre factory, for instance,  which  was\r\n\r\nquoted. We should go to the Federation and reason  out\r\n\r\nthat  this is the sensible policy to follow. In  fact,\r\n\r\neven  if  we  are not politically merged,  we  can  be\r\n\r\neconomically  merged.  Then  we  would  be   in   this\r\n\r\nposition:  that  after  we have introduced  a  customs\r\n\r\ntax - take  an  article  like  soap,  for  instance - soap\r\n\r\ncoming  from the Federation would then be  taxed  when\r\n\r\npassing the Causeway into Singapore, because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Federation is taxing our soap. We have got to tax\r\n\r\ntheir  soap  in  order to protect our  industry.  That\r\n\r\nwould  make us equal. But still the Federation  market\r\n\r\nis  a  bigger  market.  It has a population  of  seven\r\n\r\nmillion against our one and a half million. Industries\r\n\r\nthat   go   to  the  Federation  are  not  necessarily\r\n\r\nattracted  because  of  this or that  protection,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  of their bigger market. So if we go  on  like\r\n\r\nthis,  we  are  bound  to  get  retaliation  when  the\r\n\r\nFederation resent our imposing tax on their soap. They\r\n\r\nmight say, for instance, \"All right, let no pineapples\r\n\r\ngo  to Singapore to feed the Singapore factories.  All\r\n\r\nthe  pineapples  must go to the Federation  factories.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot go to Singapore.\" Then where do we stand?\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  just retaliation on one item. When  that\r\n\r\nhappens,    then    it    breeds   ill-feeling,    and\r\n\r\npolitically - as  I  read  the  phrase  in  Mr   Lyle's\r\n\r\nReport - we  may  come to the point of  no  return.  You\r\n\r\nretaliate  and counter retaliate. That is no  good  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, the only sensible thing would be to\r\n\r\nreason  out with the Federation Government and have  a\r\n\r\nPan  Malayan economic policy. For instance, there  was\r\n\r\ntalk of the City and its hinterland. If Singapore  is\r\n\r\nin  a  chaotic  condition, it can do no  good  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  at  all. If conditions in  Singapore  were\r\n\r\nrotten,  it would automatically affect the Federation.\r\n\r\nIf Singapore has thriving industries, it could in fact\r\n\r\nbenefit  the Federation because, on balance, we  still\r\n\r\nhave  a few thousand people coming down here from  the\r\n\r\nFederation   every   year  to  seek   employment.   If\r\n\r\nindustries  are thriving in the Federation,  it  could\r\n\r\nonly  do  good,  and there would be no  harm  done  to\r\n\r\nSingapore. We should not be competing with each other,\r\n\r\nbecause our people also can go to the Federation, as a\r\n\r\nlast resort, and find employment there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Changi has always harped on the\r\n\r\npoint  of a Pan Malayan economic policy. He has always\r\n\r\ntried  to  induce the Hon.

I really support him\r\n\r\nin that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndirection. If the Federation are still not ready to do\r\n\r\nthat, the only thing to do is to continue to urge them\r\n\r\nto  accept  this view arid let them see the  sense  in\r\n\r\nthis policy, instead of trying to fight back, in which\r\n\r\ncase the advantage to be gained will be outweighed  by\r\n\r\nthe  harm that could be caused. As I have said, I have\r\n\r\ntried  my best to see the Minister's viewpoint  and  I\r\n\r\nquite  agree  with  him  that  industries  should   be\r\n\r\nencouraged and helped as much as possible. But I would\r\n\r\nreally  counsel him to see whether there are  ways  of\r\n\r\ndoing  so  other  than  this quantitative  and  tariff\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.

When the mind is confused because  one\r\n\r\nis  taken unawares, then the obvious way out is to try\r\n\r\nand  belittle  any effort that is being  made  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and that is the line which the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar  has taken  this  morning  in  his\r\n\r\nopening  remarks. I am glad to know - and I am sure  the\r\n\r\npublic will make a note of his remarks - that though the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are interested in capturing power in the  next\r\n\r\nelections,  they  are not interested in  changing  the\r\n\r\neconomic  policy  of  this  country.  They   are   not\r\n\r\ninterested  in trying to solve the problem of  growing\r\n\r\nunemployment  because of increasing  population.  They\r\n\r\nare only interested in capturing power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will come back to the hon.

I  meant  to refer to the  hon.  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Mr Tan Siak Kew raised a point just at the\r\n\r\nend of his speech, and this was referred to earlier by\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member for Changi-that the obvious solution\r\n\r\nis  to  approach the Federation to see reason. I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned in this House, Sir, not only last month  but\r\n\r\npreviously,  I  think,  that we  have  approached  the\r\n\r\nFederation, and we have entreated them to accept a Pan-Malayan economic unit concept. But so far we have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able to succeed. Therefore, it is time that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  open  up other avenues so  that  when  our\r\n\r\neconomic conditions deteriorate we will not be  caught\r\n\r\nnapping but we will have something else to fall upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question of retaliation by the\r\n\r\nGovernment, in the imposition of tariffs, against  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  In  fact,  tariffs  will  be  imposed  on\r\n\r\ncommodities  coming  from any country.  It  is  not  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  retaliating against  the  Federation  as\r\n\r\nsuch. It is possible that sometimes it might hurt some\r\n\r\ncountries more than others but that is just  a  matter\r\n\r\nof  trade.  If we could get this Pan Malayan  economic\r\n\r\nunit  concept  accepted by the Federation  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nthen all these measures would not be necessary. I have\r\n\r\nsaid  this earlier in my speech when moving this Bill.\r\n\r\nThese  are measures to counter difficulties that might\r\n\r\narise because of a loss of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnatural hinterland, that is, the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nand  the surrounding countries of Indonesia which  are\r\n\r\nnow increasingly trading direct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidently, Sir, Members do not realise the gravity of\r\n\r\nthe  situation  staring us in the face.  Some  Members\r\n\r\nlive  in  the  past. They are what  the  British  call\r\n\r\n\"diehards\" who will not progress with the times.  This\r\n\r\nis  unfortunate. Some Members, though they realise the\r\n\r\ngravity   of  the  situation,  refuse,  for  political\r\n\r\nreasons,  to  accept it. That, I think,  is  bad.  The\r\n\r\npeople  should realise it because politics should  not\r\n\r\ngo above economics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Singapore  should  not  only  seek  co-operation  with  the  British  Commonwealth  and  other\r\n\r\ncountries, but, because of our historical, economic and\r\n\r\ncultural  relations with other Asian  countries,  every\r\n\r\nstep  that  Singapore takes must be taken in  the  full\r\n\r\ninterests of Asia as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Singapore proudly declare, \"We want to follow the\r\n\r\npath  which  has been opened for us by our great  Asian\r\n\r\nleader,  Pandit  Nehru.\" That is  to  say, all  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries   must  be  able  to  gain  their  political,\r\n\r\neconomic and cultural independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week in Singapore, there was a conference of\r\n\r\nBritish  diplomats  from South-East Asia.  Undoubtedly,\r\n\r\nthe  object  of  this conference was to  formulate  the\r\n\r\nBritish  policy for this area. Let it be remembered  by\r\n\r\nthe people who participated in this conference that, in\r\n\r\nformulating the British policy for the East, the wishes\r\n\r\nand    aspirations   of   the   people   of   Singapore\r\n\r\nparticularly, and Asian countries as a whole, be  given\r\n\r\nmore adequate consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the real issues threatening Singapore and other\r\n\r\nAsian countries are well known-corruption, poverty  and\r\n\r\nindustrial and social backwardness. Therefore,  if  the\r\n\r\nWestern powers are sincere in their pledge to Asia, let\r\n\r\nthem   start  by  wiping  out  corruption,  alleviating\r\n\r\npoverty and raising the standard of living of Singapore\r\n\r\nand Asia as a whole. This help will be more appreciated\r\n\r\nby  us than the empty shouting and the ineffective  so-called action against Communism in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the pros and cons, we are, however, pleased\r\n\r\nwith  the  recent  visit of the Prime Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya to the Philippines.  During  that\r\n\r\nvisit,  we were informed that the Tunku had urged  that\r\n\r\nthere should be established close economic and cultural\r\n\r\nties  between  Asian countries. Almost immediately  our\r\n\r\nChief  Minister,  Tun Lim Yew Hock, echoed  his  hearty\r\n\r\nsupport  for  such  a  suggestion. According  to  Press\r\n\r\nreports,  we even offered Singapore as the ideal  place\r\n\r\nfor  such  a  conference.  Of course,  Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nnatural venue\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor such a conference, as it is the connecting link\r\n\r\nbetween East and West. Besides being known as the\r\n\r\nGibraltar of the East, it has always been felt that\r\n\r\nSingapore is also an important place, especially in the\r\n\r\neconomic and cultural field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya,\r\n\r\nunder the able leadership of Tun Lim Yew Hock and Tunku\r\n\r\nAbdul Rahman, fully realise the fact that they do not\r\n\r\nwant to have any connection with any military\r\n\r\norganisations such as SEATO. SEATO has not won nor\r\n\r\ncould it be able to win the support of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore is still a British Colony with Britain\r\n\r\ncontrolling our foreign affairs and defence, it would\r\n\r\nappear that the British Government has committed\r\n\r\nSingapore to SEATO automatically. Whatever they do in\r\n\r\nthis respect, it is against the true wishes of the\r\n\r\npeople of this island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, Singaporeans, are proud and happy at Tunku Abdul\r\n\r\nRahman's suggestion for close economic and cultural\r\n\r\nties between South-East Asian countries. At the same\r\n\r\ntime, we are aware of the fact that the Philippines,\r\n\r\nunder President Garcia, is a strong supporter of SEATO.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Philippines will take to heart the Tunku's\r\n\r\nwise suggestion. Eventually, the Philippines will find\r\n\r\ncloser cultural and economic ties with other countries\r\n\r\nanswering more to their own need than SEATO are able to\r\n\r\noffer. This is the national outcome for the people of\r\n\r\nAsia, including Singapore - our peace loving people.\r\n\r\nTherefore, any military pact like SEATO will prove to\r\n\r\nbe far below the value of Tunku Abdul Rahman's wise\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should grab this golden opportunity to play\r\n\r\nher important role in promoting closer relations and\r\n\r\nstrengthening her economic ties with other Asian\r\n\r\ncountries. This will not only benefit Singapore most,\r\n\r\nbut Asia as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.
