M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the\r\n\r\nrecommendation of His Excellency the  Governor  to\r\n\r\nproceed  with this Bill, and I beg to move,  \"That\r\n\r\nthe Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, proposes the introduction of\r\n\r\nlight  dues to be paid by shipping using the  port\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, and the establishment  of  a  Light\r\n\r\nDues  Fund which will be administered by  a  Light\r\n\r\nDues Board. In Singapore at present, no light dues\r\n\r\nare  charged  and, as a result, the Colony  budget\r\n\r\nhas  to  bear  the  cost  of  the  maintenance  of\r\n\r\nlighthouses, flashing beacons and light buoys.  It\r\n\r\nhas also to meet the salaries, allowances, cost of\r\n\r\nuniforms  and  rations  for lighthouse  personnel,\r\n\r\ntogether with other similar items attributable  to\r\n\r\nshipping  lights.  However, in the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  Hong Kong and the British territories  in\r\n\r\nBorneo, as well as in all other major ports of the\r\n\r\nworld,  shipping is made to pay for these services\r\n\r\nby the payment of light dues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Allen Report on the Major Ports of Malaya\r\n\r\nwhich  was  published in 1950 advocated  that  the\r\n\r\ncost  of providing these navigational aids  should\r\n\r\nbe  charged to shipping in the form of light dues.\r\n\r\nThe  shipowners have indicated - though reluctantly,\r\n\r\nI  must confess - that they have no objections.  The\r\n\r\nscale  of  fees proposed in the Schedule  to  this\r\n\r\nBill  has  been carefully assessed in relation  to\r\n\r\nthe  services provided and the cost, so  that  the\r\n\r\nfees are kept down to as low a figure as possible.\r\n\r\nFor  the  sake of comparison, Sir, I  may  mention\r\n\r\nthat  whereas in the Federation the fees  are  ten\r\n\r\ncents  per net registered ton, our scale  is  only\r\n\r\ntwo cents per net registered ton for ships working\r\n\r\ncargo,  and  one  cent for ships  calling  in  for\r\n\r\nbunkers, etc. Also, in order that the dues may not\r\n\r\nthrow an undue burden on ships calling very often,\r\n\r\nthe  collection of dues has been restricted  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of ten times per year per ship. Provision\r\n\r\nhas  also  been made for the exemption of  fishing\r\n\r\nboats, small craft, Singapore Government ships and\r\n\r\nships  of  war, and an annual rate has been  fixed\r\n\r\nfor Singapore registered ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is estimated that if light dues are\r\n\r\nintroduced on the scale proposed in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSchedule  to  this Bill, the money to be  collected\r\n\r\nand  paid  into the Light Dues Fund will amount  to\r\n\r\n$414,000 per annum. The Fund will be devoted solely\r\n\r\nto  the  maintenance and improvement of  light  and\r\n\r\nnavigational aids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Light Dues Board will consist of the Master\r\n\r\nAttendant  as  Chairman, and  six  members  to  be\r\n\r\nappointed  by  me, and I propose to  give  adequate\r\n\r\nrepresentation to shipping interests.

Not only has a seaman to work hard for a\r\n\r\nliving  but  also,  by  the  very  nature  of  his\r\n\r\noccupation,   he   has  to   face   stretches   of\r\n\r\nunemployment on shore when he has finished serving\r\n\r\narticles  on a ship, not knowing when he  will  be\r\n\r\noffered employment on another. In addition to this\r\n\r\noccupational uncertainty, he has in the past  been\r\n\r\nthe victim of unscrupulous ghaut serangs,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  have  fattened themselves on this unfortunate\r\n\r\ntype  of workers. These ghaut serangs were  agents\r\n\r\nwho  were  licensed  to  supply  seamen,  and  who\r\n\r\ncharged fees from seamen for this service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order, Sir, to eliminate the ghaut serangs,\r\n\r\nthe  Government of this Colony set up  a  Seamen's\r\n\r\nRegistration  Bureau entirely  under  governmental\r\n\r\ncontrol in 1948. Legislation was passed setting up\r\n\r\na  Bureau  for  the  registration  of  seamen  and\r\n\r\napprentices to the sea, at which they  could  make\r\n\r\napplication   for   employment,   and   to   which\r\n\r\nnotifications  of  vacancies could  be  sent.  The\r\n\r\nlegislation  also  made it an  offence  to  engage\r\n\r\nseamen, except in an emergency, other than through\r\n\r\nthe   Bureau,   This  amending  legislation   also\r\n\r\nconstituted a Seafarers' Administration Board with\r\n\r\nan  independent Chairman, three members  nominated\r\n\r\nby the shipowners and three by the Seamen's Union.\r\n\r\nThe  Board was to act purely as an advisory board,\r\n\r\nto  give  advice  to the Master Attendant  on  the\r\n\r\nprocedure of registration and the working  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard,  and  to  advise the  Governor  on  matters\r\n\r\narising out of the working of the Bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Board never functioned smoothly or\r\n\r\neffectively   from   its  inception   and   became\r\n\r\nhamstrung from March 1950, when vacancies  in  its\r\n\r\nmembership  were not replaced. From  then  on, it\r\n\r\nbecame  moribund  and shipowners and  unions  have\r\n\r\nnever  been able to offer their services or  their\r\n\r\nadvice  on  the working of the Bureau  in  matters\r\n\r\nwhich  affect  them vitally. The Bureau  therefore\r\n\r\ncontinued  to function entirely under  the  Master\r\n\r\nAttendant,  with the result that it came  under  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of  criticism,  especially  from  the\r\n\r\nunions,  on  the score that though a  Register  of\r\n\r\nSeamen was maintained, it was rendered ineffective\r\n\r\nbecause   unemployed  seamen  were   not   offered\r\n\r\nemployment  according  to  the  dates   of   their\r\n\r\napplications  for employment, and because  of  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  pre-selection by  masters  of  ships\r\n\r\nthrough  their own agents. There has  been  bitter\r\n\r\ncriticism  of  partiality and favouritism  in  the\r\n\r\nselection  of crews by masters or agents.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen said that though\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe ghaut serang system has been abolished certain\r\n\r\nindividuals were able to set themselves  up  in  a\r\n\r\nfavourable  position  to the  detriment  of  those\r\n\r\nseamen   who   did  not  co-operate   with   those\r\n\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An enquiry commission was appointed in January\r\n\r\n1950  to  look  into the working of  the  Seamen's\r\n\r\nRegistration  Bureau, the method of engagement  of\r\n\r\nseamen,  the  constitution  and  duties   of   the\r\n\r\nSeafarers'  Administration Board, the practice  of\r\n\r\npre-selection and the legality of the division  of\r\n\r\nthe  roster  of unemployed seamen into two  parts,\r\n\r\none  for  deep-sea seamen and the other for  local\r\n\r\nships.  This  commission reported in January  1951\r\n\r\nbut  no  major  changes were  recommended  and  no\r\n\r\naction  was  taken  by  the  authorities  on  this\r\n\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, into this confusion stepped in the\r\n\r\nnewly   appointed   Minister  for   Commerce   and\r\n\r\nIndustry, my predecessor, Mr David Marshall, and,\r\n\r\nas a result of his intervention-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Members  mainly\r\n\r\nfollows the recommendation made by this committee,\r\n\r\nexcept for a portion of the procedure set out  for\r\n\r\nthe  engagement  of seamen. The intention  of  the\r\n\r\nBill is to incorporate a Seamen's Registry Board -\r\n\r\non  which  will  be represented in equal  numbers,\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  Government, shipowners   and\r\n\r\nseafarers,  under  an independent  chairman.  This\r\n\r\nBoard  will  in  future  be  responsible  to   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Commerce  and  Industry   for   the\r\n\r\nregistration of seamen at the Registry Board,  and\r\n\r\nfor  their  selection for employment according  to\r\n\r\nthe  procedure laid down in the Bill. As it is the\r\n\r\nintention  of  Government  that  the  Board   will\r\n\r\neventually be independent of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment, it is thought fit to set it up  under\r\n\r\na  separate Ordinance rather than by an  amendment\r\n\r\nof the Merchant Shipping Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main duty of the Board will be to establish\r\n\r\nand  maintain one or more registers of seamen and,\r\n\r\nin  its discretion, to limit its or their size  by\r\n\r\nvarious qualifying requirements, so as to create a\r\n\r\nbalanced  labour market which will serve not  only\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the shipping industry, but also,  at\r\n\r\nthe   same  time,  ensure  that  there   will   be\r\n\r\nreasonable  continuity  of  employment   for   all\r\n\r\nregistered seamen in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure for engagement, Sir, set out in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill will guarantee to ship-owners reasonable\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  choice  of crew, and  to  the  seamen\r\n\r\nconcerned  reasonable freedom of choice  of  ship.\r\n\r\nThis  will  not  only  overcome  the  grounds   of\r\n\r\ncriticism  that the present Bill is subjected  to,\r\n\r\nbut  will  also  fully accord with the  resolution\r\n\r\nadopted at the international Labour Organisation's\r\n\r\nAsian Maritime Conference in Nuwara Eliya, Ceylon,\r\n\r\nin  October 1953, at which the Government of  this\r\n\r\nColony  was  represented. For the  information  of\r\n\r\nhon.  Members, I may add that this conference  was\r\n\r\ngravely  concerned with the malpractices prevalent\r\n\r\nin  the recruitment of seamen in a number of Asian\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  recommended a solution  on  lines\r\n\r\nsimilar to what the present Bill proposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable freedom of choice of crew by the\r\n\r\nshipowner means that his choice of crew should not\r\n\r\nbe  unlimited.  To  this end, it  is  provided  in\r\n\r\nclause  5  (2) (b) that, if a shipowner  fails  to\r\n\r\nselect any registered seaman, or selects less than\r\n\r\nthe   number  he  requires  from  the   names   of\r\n\r\nregistered   seamen  put  forward  for   selection\r\n\r\naccording  to  the priority on the  Register,  the\r\n\r\nshipowner   will   be  given  only   one   further\r\n\r\nopportunity to make or complete his selection from\r\n\r\na  second list of names of registered seamen  next\r\n\r\nin  order of priority on the Register. Clause 5 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  introduces the principle  of  a  strict\r\n\r\nroster  for  the selection of seamen by shipowners\r\n\r\nwith  a  view to their employment. This  provision\r\n\r\nis, likely  to  be  very  strongly  resisted   by\r\n\r\nshipowners  for  reasons which  hon.  Members  may\r\n\r\nguess themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, it is a provision on which\r\n\r\nthe   unions   will  not  compromise   under   any\r\n\r\ncircumstances. I therefore repeat again, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthe  advantage  of the strict roster  system  laid\r\n\r\ndown  in  the  Bill is that it will do  away  with\r\n\r\nfavouritism by shipowners' selectors and lay at\r\n\r\nrest   for   ever  the  charge  by  unionists   of\r\n\r\nfavouritism by the Registration Bureau  officials.\r\n\r\nIt  will  also give all registered seamen  a  fair\r\n\r\nchance of finding employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill requires all selection of seamen with a\r\n\r\nview  to  employment  to be  made  by  responsible\r\n\r\nemployees  of the shipowner or agent, or  by  the\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  the  Board, and,  in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nforeign vessels, by consular officials approved by\r\n\r\nthe  Board  to act as selectors. These  selections\r\n\r\nhave to be made at the Board's office. Seamen  who\r\n\r\nare  re-engaged within a period of seven days  for\r\n\r\nservice  on the same ship will not be required  to\r\n\r\npresent  themselves  for  selection  through   the\r\n\r\nSeamen's   Registry  Board,  but  with  one   very\r\n\r\nimportant proviso, and that is provided that these\r\n\r\nre-engagements are limited to a maximum period  of\r\n\r\nfour  years  on the same ship. This limitation  of\r\n\r\nthe period of service of a seaman on the same ship\r\n\r\nto  a maximum of four years is necessary to enable\r\n\r\nthe  other  seamen  on  the  Register  to  have  a\r\n\r\nreasonable chance of finding employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seamen who come from territories other than the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya intending to join  ships  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   will  not  be  required   to   present\r\n\r\nthemselves  for  selection at the Registry  Board,\r\n\r\nprovided  that before their arrival in the  Colony\r\n\r\nthey  have  signed  articles.  This  provision  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to ensure that foreign seamen  are  not\r\n\r\ngiven  opportunities  of  seeking  employment   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  without being required to  comply  with\r\n\r\nthe  procedure  laid  down in  the  Bill,  and  to\r\n\r\nprotect   local  registered  seamen  from   unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition  by foreign seamen in  the  matter  of\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seamen who are left behind in the Colony and who\r\n\r\nhave  applied for engagement with a view to  their\r\n\r\nbeing  sent out of the Colony are not required  to\r\n\r\nbe selected in accordance with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprocedure  laid down in this Bill. The reason  for\r\n\r\nthis is obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, the Bill gives the Minister\r\n\r\nthe  power to make rules for the carrying  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  objects of the Ordinance, and also gives  the\r\n\r\nBoard  power to make regulations after  consulting\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to enable the Board to carry out its\r\n\r\nfunctions under the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that this legislation will be\r\n\r\nwelcomed  not  only  by all the  Members  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse, but also by the ship-owners and the unions.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we support this Bill. The\r\n\r\nMinister for Commerce and Industry has recited  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech  the  fact that the unions  have  made\r\n\r\ncharges  of  malpractices in the old  Registration\r\n\r\nBureau. The tone in which he recited them in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  implied that they were baseless and without\r\n\r\nfoundation,  that  these  charges  were  in   fact\r\n\r\nuntrue. But I think the number of seamen that have\r\n\r\nsought help from their unions and are left without\r\n\r\nredress because of the completely arbitrary way in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Master  Attendant  could  operate  the\r\n\r\nroster, has led to a great deal of dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nin  the past. We therefore welcome, and the unions\r\n\r\nwelcome,  the  fact that the method  of  selection\r\n\r\nwill now be laid down in the Ordinance itself,  in\r\n\r\nother  words, the margin of discretion to  whoever\r\n\r\noperates  the  roster  is reduced  to  the  barest\r\n\r\nminimum, and  the reasonable choice  offered  the\r\n\r\nemployer will be one which will mean that,  whilst\r\n\r\nhe  is still given the freedom of choice, he  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  in  a  position to select those  whom  he\r\n\r\ndesires but who are well down the roster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that when the Registration Bureau was\r\n\r\nfirst  instituted, it got rid of the evil  of  the\r\n\r\nghaut serangs, and I was glad to hear the Minister\r\n\r\nspeak of them in derogatory terms. People like Mr\r\n\r\nAbdul  Majid,  founder-member of the Labour  Party\r\n\r\nand one-time President of the Labour Party, he was\r\n\r\na  ghaut  serang, and quite rightly they have  now\r\n\r\nbeen assigned to oblivion. We hope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  with this new Registration Bureau the seamen\r\n\r\nwill get a fairer deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the Minister is aware that there is\r\n\r\none  very thorny problem to which the unions  have\r\n\r\nnot   found  an  answer;  that  is  the   declared\r\n\r\nintention of the Government to reduce the  roster.\r\n\r\nAs  I understand it, there are no less than 20,000\r\n\r\non this roster, and it is proposed to reduce it to\r\n\r\nsome  10,000. I do not say that, on principle,  it\r\n\r\nis bad to reduce the roster if, in fact, there are\r\n\r\ninnumerable  persons  on the  roster  who  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger   seamen,  who  either  through   sickness,\r\n\r\ninfirmity  or  old  age, or personal  inclination,\r\n\r\nhave  given up the sea as an occupation. But  what\r\n\r\nare  these  tests, what are the yardsticks, which\r\n\r\nwill  decide whether or not a man remains  on  the\r\n\r\nroster, is entitled to get a job, or whether he is\r\n\r\nstruck off the roster and is forever debarred from\r\n\r\ngoing   to   sea   to  earn  his  living?   Unless\r\n\r\nconsultation   takes   place   with   the   unions\r\n\r\nbeforehand,  and methods of selection or  criteria\r\n\r\nof selection are agreed upon, there is bound to be\r\n\r\na  great deal of dissatisfaction and a great  deal\r\n\r\nof  trouble  even  before the roster  is  settled.\r\n\r\nThat, of course, does not in any way detract  from\r\n\r\nthe  merits of the Bill, but I do ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  bear  in mind the fact that unless he can  get\r\n\r\nthe  unions  to  feel  that the  roster  has  been\r\n\r\nproperly settled, there will be no end of  trouble\r\n\r\nover the roster itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I take\r\n\r\npleasure in supporting this measure which  is  yet\r\n\r\nanother to the credit of the Government in seeking\r\n\r\nto  protect  the seamen of Singapore, who  in  the\r\n\r\npast  have  been  in a completely hopeless  state,\r\n\r\nbludgeoned   by   a   powerful   organisation   of\r\n\r\nshipowners wholly responsible for the malpractices\r\n\r\nof which we have heard in the selection of seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to see some further measure of\r\n\r\nprotection  for this group. The Bill is  a  fairly\r\n\r\nwell thought out one, and I am happy to learn that\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition is supporting it. But I would like\r\n\r\nto  draw the attention of the Minister responsible\r\n\r\nto the need for investigating the possibilities of\r\n\r\napplying  sanctions  to  shipping  which  seek  at\r\n\r\npresent  to  avoid engaging our seamen - which  they\r\n\r\nhave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  doing  traditionally - and  going  abroad,  to\r\n\r\nKarachi or Calcutta, for their needs. I know  that\r\n\r\nthe  issues raised by that problem are  of  a  far\r\n\r\nwider  character, but they must be tackled, and  I\r\n\r\nhope  that this Assembly will, in the not  distant\r\n\r\nfuture, hear more from the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meanwhile, Sir, I would like, as a\r\n\r\ncitizen,  to express my appreciation of a  measure\r\n\r\nin the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.

Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar  stated that  I  recited  the\r\n\r\nallegations  hurled at the Seamen's  Registration\r\n\r\nBureau in tones which implied that I thought  the\r\n\r\nallegations    were    baseless    and    without\r\n\r\nfoundation.  Sir,  in  the  absence  of  definite\r\n\r\nproof  of  favouritism and partiality,  I  cannot\r\n\r\ndefinitely  state that it did exist, but  I  must\r\n\r\nsay  clearly here, Sir, that I have been  unhappy\r\n\r\nwith  the  working of the Bureau - and so has  been\r\n\r\nmy  predecessor - and that is why the whole purpose\r\n\r\nof  appointing this ad hoc committee to  go  into\r\n\r\nthe  working of the Bureau shows that both of  us\r\n\r\nhave  been  unhappy over the way the  Bureau  has\r\n\r\nbeen   functioning.  As  an   outcome   of   that\r\n\r\nunhappiness, this Bill is the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I must warn this House that the\r\n\r\nprinciple   proposed  in   the   Bill   has   wide\r\n\r\nimplications. The shipowners have told me that  if\r\n\r\nthe roster system is insisted upon, they will feel\r\n\r\nfree to recruit seamen elsewhere, for example,  in\r\n\r\nHong Kong, which is one of our competitors for the\r\n\r\nsupply of seamen. Therefore, I am proposing,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat this Bill should go to a Select Committee.  I\r\n\r\ndo hope that this Committee will consider the Bill\r\n\r\nquickly and report back before the next sitting of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly, so  that we can have  the  measure\r\n\r\npassed as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that was raised by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar was the reduction of the roster\r\n\r\nfrom  20,000 to 10,000, and his query  about  what\r\n\r\ntests  are to be applied in the selection of names\r\n\r\nto  be put on the roster. The tests to be applied,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  leave  entirely to the Board.  Clause  4,\r\n\r\nparagraph (b) of the Bill, on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npage  3, states: \"The duties of the Board  shall\r\n\r\nbe . . .\"; then paragraph (b) \"...\r\n\r\nupon  application  by  a  person  desiring  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered as a seaman and upon his satisfying the\r\n\r\nprescribed qualifications to enter his name in the\r\n\r\nappropriate  register  and  issue   him   with   a\r\n\r\nregistration  card;\".  These  qualifications  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  have to be worked out by the Board,  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the unions' representatives will be present\r\n\r\nin   equal   number  to  the  representatives   of\r\n\r\nshipowners and the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roughly, Sir, I can say that the present roster\r\n\r\ncontains  more  than 20,000 names - in  fact,  about\r\n\r\n25,000, if I am not mistaken - and possibly if a new\r\n\r\nregister  is  opened, we may  find  that  probably\r\n\r\n10,000 of these may not register because they have\r\n\r\nfound other employment, or some of them have died,\r\n\r\nshifted  and so on. Many of them are not traceable\r\n\r\nat  the  moment.  This  fact  alone  may  mean   a\r\n\r\nreduction  of  about  10,000 names  when  the  new\r\n\r\nregister  is  being compiled. Further,  the  Board\r\n\r\nwill  conduct a medical test, and it may find that\r\n\r\na  few  thousand more seamen may not be  medically\r\n\r\nfit  to  be registered. This is a matter  for  the\r\n\r\nBoard to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question raised by the Member for Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nSir,  about sanctions to be applied to ships which\r\n\r\navoid recruiting seamen here and going to Calcutta\r\n\r\nor Karachi to do so - the main competitor against us\r\n\r\nfor the supply of seamen is Hong Kong, not so much\r\n\r\nCalcutta  or Karachi. This is a question which  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult to answer because you cannot force\r\n\r\na  foreign-registered ship - say, one registered  in\r\n\r\nBritain  or the Netherlands or Panama - to  take  on\r\n\r\nseamen here. Singapore is just one of the ports of\r\n\r\ncall of such a ship and if we insist that any ship\r\n\r\ncalling here must take on seamen here, India  will\r\n\r\ninsist on the same thing, and so will Indonesia. I\r\n\r\ndo not think we can do anything about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><div align=\"center\"><b>Committal to Select Committee</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

During the course of making those\r\n\r\narrangements and completing the plans to  take  the\r\n\r\ncensus,  a number of points have come to notice  on\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is  considered desirable  to  amend  the\r\n\r\nCensus  Ordinance. As a result, Sir, this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nnow before the Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the amendments is set out in some\r\n\r\ndetail in the Explanatory Note and I shall not take\r\n\r\nup  the time of the House in going through them  in\r\n\r\ndetail.  Very briefly, they first of all bring  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  up  to  date by providing  that  reports\r\n\r\nshould come to this Assembly and by transferring to\r\n\r\nthe   appropriate  Minister  certain   powers   now\r\n\r\nexercised by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a new provision to enable\r\n\r\nfurther abstracts to be taken from the census\r\n\r\nreports for use in welfare and other research\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lastly, there is a new provision which is\r\n\r\ncontained in the Schedule which specifies the\r\n\r\nparticulars which may be sought from the population\r\n\r\nduring the census. At the present moment, our\r\n\r\nOrdinance gives full power to the Governor in\r\n\r\nCouncil to lay down such particulars as they think\r\n\r\nfit. We shall now, in this Schedule, limit the\r\n\r\nfield within which questions may be asked.

The\r\n\r\npresent  position, as I said in moving the motion,\r\n\r\nis  that the law imposes no restriction whatsoever\r\n\r\non  the type of particulars which may be asked  in\r\n\r\nthe  census. We gave thought to specifying in this\r\n\r\nSchedule  some  limits within which the  questions\r\n\r\nmight  be  asked. We do not, of course, intend - nor\r\n\r\nis  it  practical - to hold a census  of  the  whole\r\n\r\npopulation of Singapore, to ask questions  of  too\r\n\r\nintimate  detail. But the census,  inevitably,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,   does  ask  questions  which   could   be\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  of  a personal and  a  confidential\r\n\r\ncharacter.  For  example,  one  of  the  kind   of\r\n\r\nquestions  is to ask a person whether  he  is  now\r\n\r\nwidowed  or  divorced, and he might well  maintain\r\n\r\nthat  that  was his private business. But  to  get\r\n\r\nback to the wording of clause 6, which I think  is\r\n\r\nthe one which causes some concern, we took a look,\r\n\r\nSir, at legislation in other places, and we took a\r\n\r\nlook  at  the corresponding legislation in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThere, the limit is referred to as relating to the\r\n\r\nsocial,  civil  and  economic  conditions  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.  We thought, Sir, that that  went  too\r\n\r\nfar,   that   the   primary  purpose   of   census\r\n\r\ninformation  was much more concerned with  welfare\r\n\r\nconditions than with economic. We then  turned  to\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom Act, and the words which appear\r\n\r\nin this Schedule are taken from the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nAct. It is truly wide but I do not think there  is\r\n\r\nany  reason to expect that it will be abused  here\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, and I would again remind the  House\r\n\r\nthat there is a very severe limit on the type  and\r\n\r\nthe  detail of questions which can be asked  in  a\r\n\r\nwhole population census. Inevitably, the questions\r\n\r\nhave to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlimited to very simple questions which can  almost\r\n\r\nbe  answered with a \"yes\" or \"no\", and there is  a\r\n\r\nlimit,  a  practical  limit,  to  the  number   of\r\n\r\nquestions  which we can ask. I feel, Sir,  that  I\r\n\r\ncan, with confidence, commend to the House the use\r\n\r\nof  this phrase which has been used in the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom for some years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, \"That clause 7 stand part of the Bill\"\r\n\r\nput, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill,\r\n\r\nas amended, be reported to the Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported, with Amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Third Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

And  that  section,\r\n\r\nSir,  goes on to provide that a claim of that kind\r\n\r\nmust  be  brought within 12 months of the date  of\r\n\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nSir, the Ordinance also provides that where  the\r\n\r\ndeceased has an executor or administrator, and  no\r\n\r\naction  for  damages  has  been  brought  by   the\r\n\r\nexecutor or the administrator for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the family of the deceased within  six\r\n\r\nmonths of the date of death, such an action can be\r\n\r\nbrought by any of the members of the family of the\r\n\r\ndeceased,   on  whose  behalf  the   executor   or\r\n\r\nadministrator might have sued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the period of 12 months to which I have\r\n\r\nreferred is considered to be too short, and it  is\r\n\r\nproposed by this Bill to extend that period of  12\r\n\r\nmonths  to  one  of  three  years.  Sir,  if  that\r\n\r\namendment  is made, the result would be that  this\r\n\r\nprovision  of  our law will be brought  into  line\r\n\r\nwith  the corresponding legislation of the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  on which this particular part of our  law\r\n\r\nis  based. In the United Kingdom, Sir, I think  it\r\n\r\nwas  in  1954  that the period of  12  months  was\r\n\r\nextended to one of three years by an amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another effect, Sir, of extending this period\r\n\r\nfrom  one of 12 months to one of three years  will\r\n\r\nbe  to  make the period of limitation in cases  of\r\n\r\nthis  kind the same as that which applies  in  the\r\n\r\ncase of actions for damages for personal injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the period of six months to which\r\n\r\nI referred a moment ago, that is the period within\r\n\r\nwhich  the members of a family cannot sue if there\r\n\r\nis  an  executor or administrator of the deceased,\r\n\r\nwith   regard  to  that  period,  this   also   is\r\n\r\nconsidered  to  be  somewhat too  short.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause it not infrequently happens that more than\r\n\r\nsix months elapse before letters of administration\r\n\r\nare  issued,  and  until  then  the  administrator\r\n\r\ncannot bring any action. As I have said, Sir,  the\r\n\r\namendment proposed by the Bill is to increase that\r\n\r\nperiod  from one of six months to a period of  one\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think, Sir, that there is anything\r\n\r\nwhich I can usefully add to what I have said about\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. It is a very short measure but I think\r\n\r\nMembers would like to know that it has the support\r\n\r\nof the legal profession in Singapore. I would also\r\n\r\nlike  to say that I am indebted to the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill who, a little while ago, suggested to me\r\n\r\nthat  it was time that our law was amended on  the\r\n\r\nlines I have indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that this measure will be\r\n\r\nacceptable to hon.

It arises  from  the\r\n\r\nrealisation that in this colony there are many who\r\n\r\nare  not literate in the English language and  who\r\n\r\nare  not conscious of their rights, and it is only\r\n\r\nmany  months  after the death of  a  member  of  a\r\n\r\nfamily  due to the negligence of some other person\r\n\r\nthat  members  of the family of the  deceased  are\r\n\r\nmade conscious of their right to claim damages. It\r\n\r\nis  then often found, Sir, that, due also  to  the\r\n\r\ndelays  in  obtaining letters  of  administration,\r\n\r\nthey  are estopped by the provisions of the  Civil\r\n\r\nLaw Ordinance from pursuing their claims - quite unnecessarily estopped. There is no magic in the  12\r\n\r\nmonths and in the six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say in fairness to insurance companies that\r\n\r\nquite often they have settled claims although made\r\n\r\nout  of  time,  but,  Sir,  the  position  is   an\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory one where you have to depend on the\r\n\r\nindulgence  of commercial concerns like  insurance\r\n\r\ncompanies.  The  amendments  here  sought   merely\r\n\r\nincrease the time so as to give a reasonable  time\r\n\r\nto the dependants of victims of traffic accidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the learned Attorney-General did mention it, but I think I should add\r\n\r\nthat these amendments have in fact taken place  in\r\n\r\nthe English law about three years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.29 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, it used to be a game among\r\n\r\nsolicitors who appeared for insurance companies to\r\n\r\ndilly-dally  with the inexperienced solicitor  who\r\n\r\nappeared  for the poor dependants of the deceased,\r\n\r\nkeep  him hoping and waiting until the six  months\r\n\r\nis  up  and  the axe has fallen, and then  smartly\r\n\r\nsuggest to the inexperienced solicitor that he had\r\n\r\nbetter  watch  out  for  a suit  for  damages  for\r\n\r\nnegligence   for  having  allowed  the  limitation\r\n\r\nperiod to elapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support this amendment because the man-made\r\n\r\nlaw which says that after a year the estate of the\r\n\r\nperson   should   either  sue  or   not   sue   is\r\n\r\nunnecessary.  But I am concerned that  legislation\r\n\r\nof   this   nature  has  to  await  the   personal\r\n\r\ninitiative, the personal flair of individuals. Our\r\n\r\nlegislation   is   mainly   based    on    English\r\n\r\nlegislation. Our legislation is usually introduced\r\n\r\nseveral  years after that legislation on which  it\r\n\r\nis  modelled  has  been  working  successfully  in\r\n\r\nEngland. But it seems that that is the end of  the\r\n\r\nmatter,    In   innumerable   instances,    social\r\n\r\nconditions  change  and  the  law  in  England  is\r\n\r\nchanged to meet changed conditions. But the law in\r\n\r\nSingapore goes on without any change. Is there  no\r\n\r\ncommittee, is there no machinery, that  keeps  the\r\n\r\nlaw  of  Singapore up to date? Take, for instance,\r\n\r\nthe  question of contributory negligence  and  the\r\n\r\ndoctrine  of  common  employment.  They  were  two\r\n\r\nprinciples  of law which obtained in  England  and\r\n\r\nobtained in this Colony. They were iniquitous. The\r\n\r\ndoctrine of common employment said that if you are\r\n\r\nkilled or injured as a result of the negligence of\r\n\r\nyour  fellow-worker, who is in  common  employment\r\n\r\nwith  you,  then you have no remedy  against  your\r\n\r\nemployer because you are deemed to have undertaken\r\n\r\nthe  risk  of  injury by that fellow-worker.  That\r\n\r\ndoctrine  was  abolished when the  British  Labour\r\n\r\nParty  assumed office after the end of the  Second\r\n\r\nWorld War. But it was not till some seven or eight\r\n\r\nyears  later that some enterprising lawyer lobbied\r\n\r\nthe  bar and the Attorney-General, and finally got\r\n\r\nit  through  in  Singapore. But  the  enterprising\r\n\r\nlawyer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad this interest because he represented many such\r\n\r\nclients  who  were often debarred from  recovering\r\n\r\ndamages because of this doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have cited two instances to show that the\r\n\r\nposition  is  unsatisfactory, that amendments  and\r\n\r\nthe  bringing  of  our law up to date  should  not\r\n\r\ndepend     upon     spasmodic    and     haphazard\r\n\r\namendments - that there should be some machinery  to\r\n\r\nkeep  the law all the time up to date. I think  it\r\n\r\nshould   not   be  beyond  the  Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nDepartment,   in   conjunction  with   the   Legal\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  the  Colonial  Office,  to  supply\r\n\r\nSingapore  with  information on  the  progress  of\r\n\r\nBills,  Acts of Parliament, that have taken  place\r\n\r\nsince those Acts were adopted by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr C.

In the case  of  a\r\n\r\nsalary  of  $1,950 the variable  allowance  for  a\r\n\r\nmarried  man  would  be $280, making  a  total  of\r\n\r\n$2,230.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the statutory provision of subsection\r\n\r\n(2)  of  section  10  of the Ordinance,  that  the\r\n\r\nremuneration  of  the Members  of  the  Commission\r\n\r\nshall  not  be  diminished during  their  term  of\r\n\r\noffice, we have thought it better not to link that\r\n\r\nremuneration   in  any  way  with   the   variable\r\n\r\nallowance   paid  to  Government   officers.   The\r\n\r\nvariable  allowance,  as  the  name  implies,   is\r\n\r\nsubject to variation and to reduction, and we have\r\n\r\naccordingly  put  the  Chairman  on  an  inclusive\r\n\r\nsalary of $2,300 a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate for the Members of the Commission\r\n\r\nremains  the same as that paid to the  Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  previous  Commission, and their  appointments\r\n\r\nare, of course, on the understanding that they may\r\n\r\ncontinue  their other occupations. But the  Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman will have greater responsibility, and  to\r\n\r\nmark  that  we have fixed his retainer at  $750  a\r\n\r\nmonth  as  compared  with $500  a  month  for  the\r\n\r\nordinary Member of the Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said just now, Sir, that the Chairman and\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  are\r\n\r\nundertaking  a  most onerous and important  public\r\n\r\nduty, and I ask all Members of this House to  join\r\n\r\nme  in  wishing them well in their task. The  time\r\n\r\nfor  criticism  and  recrimination  is  past.

P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, the experience of the\r\n\r\npast  years  in the Public Relations  Office  has\r\n\r\nshown that there is much room for improvement  in\r\n\r\nthe  organisation  for making  Government  policy\r\n\r\nknown  and for keeping the various Ministries  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government informed of the trends of  public\r\n\r\nfeeling. An organisation for the effective public\r\n\r\npresentation  of its policies and actions  is  an\r\n\r\nessential  requirement of a modern  parliamentary\r\n\r\ngovernment. The basis for such an organisation in\r\n\r\nSingapore, Sir, already existed  in  the  Public\r\n\r\nRelations  Officer  and his staff  working  as  a\r\n\r\ndepartment  within  the portfolio  of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary. This instrument, Sir, has not been  as\r\n\r\neffective as desired, mainly for the reason  that\r\n\r\nthe title \"Public Relations Office\" suggested  an\r\n\r\norganisation  mainly of a press  liaison  agency.\r\n\r\nThe  duties of the Public Relations Officer  have\r\n\r\nnever  been defined in detail and there has never\r\n\r\nbeen  any  prescribed contact between the  Public\r\n\r\nRelations  Officer and the other  Ministries  and\r\n\r\nDepartments of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good public relations organisation, Sir, is\r\n\r\nmuch  more than a press liaison unit. The  public\r\n\r\npresentation of the Government's policy, if it is\r\n\r\nto   be  effective,  cannot  depend  on  sporadic\r\n\r\ncampaigns  and statements arranged  according  to\r\n\r\nthe  particular needs and events, but requires  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous  effort  to obtain an  atmosphere, an\r\n\r\naudience receptive to Government policy.  To  get\r\n\r\nthis  effect, the instrument responsible must  be\r\n\r\naccorded  the necessary degree of importance  and\r\n\r\nauthority, and be given a corresponding  position\r\n\r\nof  trust, and facilities in carrying  out  that\r\n\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the re-entitlement of the Public Relations\r\n\r\nOffice to Information Services itself has gone so\r\n\r\nfar to indicate the part\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  to play in the Government structure, and\r\n\r\nwould  serve to lift the organisation above  what\r\n\r\nis  commonly  but  erroneously thought  to  be  a\r\n\r\nsimple  function  of the press  liaison  officer.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Government  has considered  all  these\r\n\r\naspects and recognises the important role  to  be\r\n\r\nplayed by information services in this democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  of  government in Singapore.  It  regards\r\n\r\nthat there should be adequate funds and staff  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the needs of this service. The tendency  to\r\n\r\nneglect  the information services, Sir,  until  a\r\n\r\nmoment of crisis, is bad. It is not possible  for\r\n\r\ninformation   services   to   be   an   effective\r\n\r\ninstrument overnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having considered all these subjects, Sir, the\r\n\r\nInformation  Services  is  now  equipped  with  a\r\n\r\nCentral  Translation Bureau, and it  is  intended\r\n\r\nthat,  from  now  on,  the  non-English  speaking\r\n\r\npopulation  will  be served better  than  in  the\r\n\r\npast. I can assure the Member for Cairnhill, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat every effort is being made to reorganise and\r\n\r\nimprove  even  the daily and weekly  digests  and\r\n\r\nmake them more effective and useful in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am a bit\r\n\r\nconfused  by  all this because before,  when  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill was the Chief Minister,  we\r\n\r\nwere  so often told that the Information Services\r\n\r\nwere  excellent,  and they were  complimented  on\r\n\r\nmany   occasions.  I  remember   one   particular\r\n\r\noccasion  most distinctly, when I  took  them  to\r\n\r\ntask for doing a lot of things irregularly with a\r\n\r\nbias    in   favour   of   people   like    Chief\r\n\r\nMinisters - distributing   their    speeches    and\r\n\r\nblacking out the Opposition.

I would like  to  remind\r\n\r\nthe Minister responsible, and I would also like to\r\n\r\nremind  the Front Bench, that this Legal  Aid  and\r\n\r\nAdvice Ordinance received the unanimous support of\r\n\r\nthe  House, that it was intended that the concepts\r\n\r\nof  justice and the machinery for justice in  this\r\n\r\ncountry should be made available to all the people\r\n\r\nin  the  country. As I see it now,  Sir,  we  have\r\n\r\nnothing  but a head peon with a sub-peon. That  is\r\n\r\nthe Department we have created to bring justice to\r\n\r\nthe people of the country and to bring the law  to\r\n\r\nall the villagers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a suggestion that we must depend\r\n\r\nupon the Bar for the working of the Legal Aid  and\r\n\r\nAdvice Ordinance. This Ordinance is not a lawyers'\r\n\r\naid  Ordinance. It is not intended  to  put  money\r\n\r\ninto  the pockets of lawyers, although as a lawyer\r\n\r\nI have no objection to having money being put into\r\n\r\nmy  pocket! At the same time let us make it  clear\r\n\r\nthat  this  Ordinance was not intended  to  assist\r\n\r\nmembers   of  this  trade  union - who   are   doing\r\n\r\nextremely  well,  thank you! It  was  intended  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  law to the people, and they  need  it.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to begin with, Sir, unless this country\r\n\r\nis going to spend fantastic sums of money which it\r\n\r\nhas  not  got,  it  has  to  create  a  large  and\r\n\r\nefficient department, a public defence department,\r\n\r\nand it was the intention as I understand it (and I\r\n\r\nam  proud  that I was mainly responsible for  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance), it was the intention that the officer-in-charge  should  have  equal  status  with   the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General.   He  should   have   a   large,\r\n\r\nqualified  staff. He should have branches  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious  parts of the country so that he can  give\r\n\r\naid and advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of those ambitions and ideals we have nothing\r\n\r\nbut  a mouse! I would ask, Sir, how come that this\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  after having gone through the  various\r\n\r\nCivil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nService departments, has been whittled down  to  a\r\n\r\nfarce?

These provisions are two  months  late\r\n\r\nalready.  I take it that before they are  even  in\r\n\r\nforce there will not be a Department of Legal  Aid\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I view with considerable concern the\r\n\r\napproach  and attitude to this problem. Either  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  Legal Aid Department, or - if that  is  the\r\n\r\nintention of the Government let us have it frankly\r\n\r\n- the whole thing is going to be shelved. But I  am\r\n\r\nquite certain that the present Chief Minister, who\r\n\r\nas  Labour Minister at the relevant time so warmly\r\n\r\nproposed  and carried through the Bill, would  not\r\n\r\nand does not intend to bring about what seem to be\r\n\r\nthe  present  consequences.

When I supported the Legal Aid and  Advice\r\n\r\nBill,   we  did  not  envisage  branches  of   the\r\n\r\nDepartment  all  over  the  country,  nor  did  we\r\n\r\nenvisage  a competitor to the Attorney-General!  I\r\n\r\nwould like to clarify this point because I did not\r\n\r\nhave that in my mind when we passed the Bill.  But\r\n\r\nI do agree with the Member for Cairnhill - even if I\r\n\r\ncannot say so as vehemently as he has done - that  a\r\n\r\nvery  serious attempt should be made by the  Legal\r\n\r\nDepartment to get this machinery going. It  is  no\r\n\r\nuse  telling the people that you have a  wonderful\r\n\r\ndemocratic  machine if you do not offer  them  the\r\n\r\nmechanics  to operate that machinery for  them  as\r\n\r\nand when required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important that we should not call it a\r\n\r\nPublic Defence Department because if we do so  the\r\n\r\npublic  will soon lose confidence in  it.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  said at the Bar, of course, that if you have\r\n\r\none  department of the Government prosecuting  and\r\n\r\ncan  nip around to the other Government department\r\n\r\nto defend you, the public may think that it is not\r\n\r\nlikely   that  the  Government  should   want   to\r\n\r\ncontradict   itself,  that  it  should   want   to\r\n\r\nprosecute  a man and then get the man whom  it  is\r\n\r\nprosecuting off. Therefore the Bar would, in spite\r\n\r\nof  all the effort of this legal aid scheme, still\r\n\r\nbe  stuffing their money with pockets - I mean their\r\n\r\npockets with money - I get confused when I think  of\r\n\r\nthe stories that have been floating around! If you\r\n\r\ngo  to see a government lawyer to get you off from\r\n\r\na  government prosecutor, how would you think  you\r\n\r\nare  going  to  get off? Therefore,  I  would  not\r\n\r\ndismiss so lightly the representations of the  Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee.  After  all,  they  do  represent   125\r\n\r\nmembers at the Bar who, in spite of the fact  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  financial interests in this Legal  Aid\r\n\r\nand  Advice  Ordinance, have also  considered  the\r\n\r\nmatter  carefully  and  have made  representations\r\n\r\nbased  on the principles upon which the legal  aid\r\n\r\nscheme has been working in England.

If we approach  it  from\r\n\r\nthe  practical point of view, Sir, and appoint our\r\n\r\nown men - and we have some very fine men coming out\r\n\r\nand  practising  at the Bar today, youngsters  who\r\n\r\nwould do credit to any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntask  assigned  to  them for the  purpose  of  the\r\n\r\npractice  of the law - I say, Sir, that  it  can  be\r\n\r\nworked and it can be worked at a moderate fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the public fears that one government\r\n\r\nemployee  would  not be able to defend  you  where\r\n\r\nanother  government  employee prosecutes,  let  us\r\n\r\nremember  that in New South Wales, where  I  first\r\n\r\nlearnt  about this system, the Public  Solicitor's\r\n\r\nOffice is a flourishing one which is consulted  by\r\n\r\nvery considerable numbers who cannot afford to  go\r\n\r\nto  a  lawyer.  The point is not  that  we  should\r\n\r\ncompel people to go and seek advice - if they do not\r\n\r\nwant it they do not have to. The point is that  we\r\n\r\nshould  try to make available to those who  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  pay for legal consultation. We  should\r\n\r\nmake  available  to them at such cost  or  without\r\n\r\ncost, as they may be able to afford, the machinery\r\n\r\nfor   enforcing  their  just  rights,   and   make\r\n\r\navailable  to them advice which they may  need  to\r\n\r\nunderstand their rights. By the creation, Sir,  of\r\n\r\njust one individual at $1,620 and an assistant, we\r\n\r\ndo  not  do so. That is my argument, and  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask now, Sir, for a full explanation as to\r\n\r\nwhat is intended under this Legal Aid Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Sir, the\r\n\r\nmeeting has been quiet so far, but now we come  to\r\n\r\na  position where a back-bencher of the Government\r\n\r\nattacks  the  Government,  and  a  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition tries to defend the Government!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of order, Sir, I\r\n\r\nobject to being misrepresented in that way.

Sir, when the Opposition said  it  was\r\n\r\ntrying   to  say  something  to  defend  the   Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee it said something that I would have said\r\n\r\nmyself.  Sir, the purpose of putting in a  request\r\n\r\nfor  a vote for the sum in question is to set Part\r\n\r\nI of the Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance in motion.\r\n\r\nAs  to  the other parts of the Ordinance,  I  have\r\n\r\npointed  out  at  previous  sittings  that  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause of representations from the Bar Committee,\r\n\r\nand  mainly because of their assurance  that  they\r\n\r\nwish  to cooperate with this Government in  making\r\n\r\nthe  Legal Aid and Advice Ordinance work,  that  I\r\n\r\nfeel  we should hold more consultations with them.\r\n\r\nIn  moving the Second Reading of the Bill, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it  could only work  if  we  had, the\r\n\r\ncooperation  of  the  Bar Committee.  However, if\r\n\r\nafter  discussions with the Bar Committee  we  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  come to a satisfactory  solution,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will of course have to go  ahead  with\r\n\r\nwhat  the Government think is right for the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. The Government have  not  given  up\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  Bar Committee,  after  expressing\r\n\r\ntheir  desire  to co-operate with the  Government,\r\n\r\nwill  not  come,  shall we  say,  to  an  amicable\r\n\r\nsolution on the opposition which they have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the operation of Part I of the Ordinance,\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is felt that the posts now to be created\r\n\r\nunder  this  vote are sufficient.

I  think\r\n\r\nthat,  for this free legal aid scheme to  succeed,\r\n\r\nwe  will have to depend a great deal on the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession.

I  would\r\n\r\nremind  him,  however, that the character  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole  profession is rapidly going through a great\r\n\r\nchange.  Whilst in 1939 it was an exclusive  white\r\n\r\nman's  preserve, it is now very rapidly, parallel\r\n\r\nwith  political developments in the country  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,  undergoing a change. The Bar is  going  to\r\n\r\nbe - and we should make it - a local man's Bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is therefore no point in going around\r\n\r\nshaking  one's fist, or rattling one's  sabre,  or\r\n\r\nbrandishing  a  pen-knife  and  antagonising   120\r\n\r\nmembers of the profession (and perhaps another  20\r\n\r\nmore who are awaiting entry) with whom we want  to\r\n\r\nco-operate. We need their assistance to  make  the\r\n\r\nmachinery work. We must not go around making  what\r\n\r\nI  know  are unfair accusations. The Bar Committee\r\n\r\nhave  not  said they will not co-operate with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. All they have said is that  there  are\r\n\r\ncertain aspects of the Ordinance which they do not\r\n\r\nlike,  and  the  Government have  said  they  will\r\n\r\nlisten to the Bar Committee's representations.  If\r\n\r\nin  the end, however, the Government wish to  push\r\n\r\nthe  scheme through, the best the Bar  can  do  is\r\n\r\njust  to  let  it  be. The Bar cannot  oppose  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and they know that. In  such  a  case,\r\n\r\nhowever, the Bar could sit back and say: \"You work\r\n\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be another matter and the scheme would\r\n\r\nthen  depend  on  the men you can  get  into  this\r\n\r\npublic  legal aid and advice bureau and  also  the\r\n\r\nattitude of the Bar. If the general opinion of the\r\n\r\nBar  is  that  the  bureau is  staffed  by  feeble\r\n\r\nlawyers who cannot make a living at the Bar,  then\r\n\r\nthe  whole  scheme is stymied from the  beginning.\r\n\r\nThere is no point working up all this feeling just\r\n\r\nbecause I happened to ask why the post was  graded\r\n\r\nF.  I was genuinely curious to know why some Civil\r\n\r\nService expert had down-graded this job. I am  not\r\n\r\nusually prone to making pleas for moderation,  but\r\n\r\nwe  must  not be unreasonable if we want  to  make\r\n\r\nthis  legal  aid  scheme work, as  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill does want to make it work.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  have to be convinced as to his sincerity.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he will remember that on one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noccasion, I think it was in 1952 or 1953, when  he\r\n\r\nwas  struggling with the then Bar Committee  which\r\n\r\nwas governed by expatriates, they appointed him  a\r\n\r\none-man committee and thereby shelved the problem.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would remind him that, at the moment,  the\r\n\r\nBar  Committee consist of six local  men  and  one\r\n\r\nexpatriate, who got in only on a re-count. It is a\r\n\r\nlocal  man's Bar. Every year there are  20  or  30\r\n\r\nstudents returning, and there is no point rattling\r\n\r\nthe  sabre at them. Let us make sure, first,  that\r\n\r\nthey  are really a nasty and selfish lot of people\r\n\r\nbefore one rattles the sabre. Let us first try  to\r\n\r\nmake them understand that it is in their interests\r\n\r\nto  make  the  scheme work, that it  is  in  their\r\n\r\ninterests  to make the whole legal machinery  work\r\n\r\nefficiently, so that the democratic system can  be\r\n\r\npreserved and they can continue to be lawyers  and\r\n\r\nnot garbage collectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is a\r\n\r\nsurprise to me to see the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nsuddenly becoming an unofficial representative  of\r\n\r\nthe Bar Committee in this House.

It says,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Subject to the provisions of section 7 of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  in  carrying out the objects  provided\r\n\r\nfor  in  subsection (I) of this section the  Board\r\n\r\nshall   have  due  regard  to  the  economic   and\r\n\r\ncommercial merits of any undertaking it  promotes,\r\n\r\nassists,  finances or manages and shall also  take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration in considering  such  economic\r\n\r\nand  commercial merits, the economic merits of any\r\n\r\nother undertaking in which it has an interest  and\r\n\r\nthe  economic  requirements of  the  Colony  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5 (2) , Sir, is also relevant, and it\r\n\r\nreads,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Whenever the Board shall lend money to or\r\n\r\nassist  financially any undertaking, it  shall  so\r\n\r\nfar  as possible ensure that its loan or financial\r\n\r\nassistance is not unduly in excess of any loan  or\r\n\r\ncapital  investment by any other person interested\r\n\r\nin such undertaking.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond this guidance which is laid down in the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, the members of the Board will  have  to\r\n\r\nexercise their own judgment. I am sure they should\r\n\r\nbe  good  judges because section 9 (1)  lays  down\r\n\r\nthat  besides  the  Financial Secretary's  and  my\r\n\r\nrepresentatives on the Board, the Chairman and two\r\n\r\nother members should be persons appearing to me to\r\n\r\nhave  had experience of, and having shown capacity\r\n\r\nin, matters relating to banking, finance, industry\r\n\r\nor  trade administration. They will, therefore, be\r\n\r\npersons of mature experience capable of exercising\r\n\r\ngood judgment in such matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration, Sir, is now being given to\r\n\r\nmembership  of the Board and it is hoped  to  make\r\n\r\nthe  appointments  shortly. The  Board  will  then\r\n\r\nselect  its own Manager, who will arrange for  the\r\n\r\nformal commencement of its activities.

It is important, if\r\n\r\nwe  are  not  to  start  something  on  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\npattern,  that the person who is appointed to this  job\r\n\r\nis a man of integrity, someone who has never had public\r\n\r\ncriticism levied at him before, particularly  from  the\r\n\r\npublic  service  itself. He must  be  someone  who  can\r\n\r\ncommand  that confidence, so as to leave  no  doubt  in\r\n\r\nanybody's mind that public funds are not being  fiddled\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, we have supported  this  Industrial\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board in the hope that more industries  will\r\n\r\nbe  saved  and  encouraged. On the  motion  asking  for\r\n\r\nmoney,  we  would  like the Minister for  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nIndustry to bear in mind that members who are appointed\r\n\r\nto  this Board should be impartial ones, because I have\r\n\r\na  fear  that if the people who sit on the Board should\r\n\r\ncome  from one type of business that fears competition,\r\n\r\nthey  will definitely not want to encourage other types\r\n\r\nof  business that will compete with theirs.

Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I think the Member for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  has misunderstood the contents  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance. The Chairman is not going to be a  full-time\r\n\r\nChairman,  like that of the Public Service  Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman and members will just come to meetings and\r\n\r\nconduct  the business of the Board at meetings.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  the intention to have a full-time Chairman. As  to\r\n\r\nfees,  it depends on how much time they have to  devote\r\n\r\nto the work of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Board before I consider whether Government will  be\r\n\r\nwilling  to  pay them any fee or not. I  take  it  that\r\n\r\nmembers of the Board will be persons who are well-to-do\r\n\r\nbecause  they  must  be  connected,  according  to  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  with  either  industry,  banking  or  trade\r\n\r\nadministration, and therefore I am sure  that  if  they\r\n\r\nare  public-spirited they will give their services  and\r\n\r\nexperience free to the Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably what the Member is referring to is the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  the Manager, who will be  a  full-time\r\n\r\nman,  and  who will carry out investigations  into  the\r\n\r\napplicants'  business, industry, and so  on,  and  then\r\n\r\ngive the results of these investigations to the meeting\r\n\r\nof the Board for them to make a decision. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhich  person he has in mind, but I can assure him  and\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Serangoon that all appointments to  the\r\n\r\nBoard will be made from persons who, after a great deal\r\n\r\nof thought, I consider to be impartial. Of course, I am\r\n\r\nrestricted  by the section in the Ordinance which  says\r\n\r\nthat  for these appointments I shall have to take  into\r\n\r\naccount that the person selected should be someone  who\r\n\r\nhas  had  experience  in  industry,  finance  or  trade\r\n\r\nadministration. This stipulation was purposely  put  in\r\n\r\nbecause this type of board should be run by persons who\r\n\r\nare experienced in the businesses concerned. If you put\r\n\r\nanybody on the Board - a doctor or a lawyer, say - you  may\r\n\r\nfind  that  they  will not be able  to  understand  the\r\n\r\nproblems of the industries concerned which are applying\r\n\r\nfor loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point I wish to make, and that is\r\n\r\nthat the members will be appointed by me with the prior\r\n\r\napproval  of  the  Governor in Council.  Therefore,  if\r\n\r\nthere  should be any misjudgment by one member  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Ministers, that is  by  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce  and Industry, there will be other Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Council of Ministers who will have to approve that\r\n\r\nmisjudgment before the appointment can be made.
