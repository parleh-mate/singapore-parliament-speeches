Even the bursaries we now\r\n\r\npay to Singapore students at Nanyang University will\r\n\r\nhave to cease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it difficult to reconcile the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson's apparent concern for Nanyang University with\r\n\r\nhis support for a type of merger which means Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity will have to comply with the Rahman Talib\r\n\r\nReport  or not to be supported at all and  so  upset\r\n\r\nChinese educationists in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 31st October, 1961, in the Speech of the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara, Hansard, Vol. 15, No.  1, column\r\n\r\n22,  mention was made of Nanyang University  in  the\r\n\r\nfollowing words:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government is as anxious as the founders of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University  that the University  should  be\r\n\r\nreorganised.  Towards this end, a liaison  committee\r\n\r\ncomprising representatives of the Government and the\r\n\r\nUniversity  held  several  meetings  last  year   to\r\n\r\ndiscuss   ways   and   means  of  implementing   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  made  by  the  Nanyang   University\r\n\r\nReview  Committee.  Although no agreement  has  been\r\n\r\nreached  by  the liaison committee, nonetheless  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is always ready to negotiate and  discuss\r\n\r\nthis  matter. There are hopes that this problem will\r\n\r\nbe solved in the coming year.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 27th November last, at a dinner given by the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister to the President and 9 members of the\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber of Commerce which included Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nLark  Sye, discussions were held on the arrangements\r\n\r\nfor  local  autonomy on education and labour,  trade\r\n\r\nand  commerce, language and citizenship.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister then suggested to Mr Tan that there should\r\n\r\nbe  agreement between the present Council of Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity and the Ministry of Education as soon  as\r\n\r\npossible  before  July  or  August  1962   so   that\r\n\r\nprovisions could be included in the budget for 1963.\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  Lark Sye suggested, with the other members\r\n\r\nof the Chamber of Commerce present\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagreeing, that the matter could be left to  informal\r\n\r\ndiscussions between a member of the Chamber  present\r\n\r\nwho   was   named,  and  Mr  Lee  Khoon  Choy,   my\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary, who was also  a  Government\r\n\r\nrepresentative   in  the  Liaison  Committee   which\r\n\r\ncarried  out discussions with the Nanyang University\r\n\r\nCouncil in 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the outstanding matters before agreement\r\n\r\ncan be reached is the question of representation  in\r\n\r\nthe new University Council. The Government stand  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  balance of representation in the  Council\r\n\r\nwould  and  should  leave academic policy  decisions\r\n\r\nwith   the   academicians  and   teachers   in   the\r\n\r\nUniversity,  whereas the proposals  of  the  present\r\n\r\nNanyang University authorities meant that all policy\r\n\r\ndecisions both academic and otherwise should be with\r\n\r\nthe merchants who first sponsored the University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government was and is of the view that,\r\n\r\nalthough  the  public-spiritedness and  interest  in\r\n\r\neducation  of  our Chinese merchants deserve  praise\r\n\r\nfor  having  helped  to create  Nanyang  University,\r\n\r\nmerchants  and  businessmen are not necessarily  the\r\n\r\nbest   qualified  people  to  decide  academic   and\r\n\r\neducational matters involved in the running  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is prepared to discuss all details,\r\n\r\nincluding annual grants by the Government to Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity, in accordance with the principles of the\r\n\r\nGwee  Ah  Leng  Review Committee's Report.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection,  Dr  Gwee Ah Leng has  referred  me  to\r\n\r\nreports published in both the Nanyang Siang Pau  and\r\n\r\nthe  Sin  Chew  Jit  Poh dated 27th  January,  1962,\r\n\r\nattributed to Mr Tan Lark Sye at a dinner speech of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese Chamber of Commerce held at the  Ee  Ho\r\n\r\nHean  Club on 26th. January in which Mr Tan alleged\r\n\r\nthat  Dr  Gwee had to amend his report three  times\r\n\r\nbecause  the Government was not satisfied  with  it.\r\n\r\nDr  Gwee informed me that he had written to Mr Tan\r\n\r\nLark  Sye by registered post, asking him to  correct\r\n\r\nthis    unfounded   statement.   With   Dr   Gwee's\r\n\r\npermission, I wish to table a photostat copy of  his\r\n\r\nletter in Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\nfor information of the House.

P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  House rose on Friday evening, I had  just\r\n\r\naddressed  it  for  about  three  or  four  minutes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  Sir, if you will allow me to  recapitulate\r\n\r\nshortly what I had mentioned to the House in  a  few\r\n\r\nwords and then proceed from there, so that my speech\r\n\r\nmight then he received in proper perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first motion on merger with the\r\n\r\nFederation  was discussed. I got the impression,  as\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues also did, that so far as the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  were  concerned, they  were  all  for  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian concept as outlined by the Tunku. In fact,\r\n\r\nthe  whole  outcry  from the Barisan  Sosialis  side\r\n\r\nagainst   the   Tunku,  insofar  as  Singapore   was\r\n\r\nconcerned, was that Singapore was not being  treated\r\n\r\nin  the  same  way that the Borneo territories  were\r\n\r\nbeing treated. It appeared from their side that  the\r\n\r\nTunku  had  offered  to bring in  the  three  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories  as  three additional  States  into  the\r\n\r\nFederation on an equal footing, shall we  say,  with\r\n\r\nJohore  or Selangor or with any other State  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  They also said that if only  the  Tunku\r\n\r\nmade  all  the Singapore citizens Federal  citizens,\r\n\r\nthey  would  be quite happy to go in as the  twelfth\r\n\r\nState.  In fact, the whole outcry against the  Tunku\r\n\r\nwas  that  Singapore would not be made  the  twelfth\r\n\r\nState.  Now  if that is the correct appreciation  of\r\n\r\nthe  main  line  on  which the Barisan  opposed  the\r\n\r\nmerger   proposals,  I,  at  the  moment,   do   not\r\n\r\nunderstand  the line taken by them on  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nmotion. I believe we started to debate the motion on\r\n\r\nmerger  with  the Federation on 17th  November  last\r\n\r\nyear  which lasted for two or three weeks. But since\r\n\r\nthen,  it would appear that the point of attack  has\r\n\r\nchanged.  The point of attack now is not  about  the\r\n\r\nBorneo   territories  coming  in  as  the   twelfth,\r\n\r\nthirteenth  and fourteenth States. It is  that  they\r\n\r\nare  not being allowed to have a say in whether they\r\n\r\nshould  be  part of Malaysia or whether they  should\r\n\r\nstay  out;  whether  or not the first  step  in  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia proposals should not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  independence for each of these territories, then\r\n\r\nan  understanding  between the three  of  them,  and\r\n\r\nfinally  their  coming into the  Malaysia  proposals\r\n\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it seems fairly clear now - to me\r\n\r\nanyway, Mr Speaker - that there has been a change  of\r\n\r\nfront  insofar as the Barisan Sosialis are concerned\r\n\r\non  Malaysia. I got the impression, from  the  first\r\n\r\ndebate,  that they were all for Malaysia.  But  that\r\n\r\nwhat is objectionable in the Malaysia proposals  was\r\n\r\nthe  status  that was being given to  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthat Singapore citizens were going to become second-class citizens. Now the point of attack is something\r\n\r\nquite  different. I was listening  to  a  number  of\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Members speaking in the hope  that\r\n\r\nthey  would explain to the House why this change  of\r\n\r\nattitude had taken place since the conclusion of the\r\n\r\ndebate on the merger with the Federation motion  and\r\n\r\nthe  commencement  of this debate  on  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nmotion. I think it was the Minister for Culture  who\r\n\r\nsuggested to the Barisan Sosialis that the change of\r\n\r\nfront  was  because  the Barisan  Sosialis  are  not\r\n\r\nfollowing  a line of their own, and that their  line\r\n\r\nis   being  dictated  to  them  by  forces   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore and forces with which Singapore should not\r\n\r\nbe concerned at all. It has since been denied by the\r\n\r\nBarisan  that  that is so. But the  facts  point  to\r\n\r\nthis,  that  during  the course of  the  West  Irian\r\n\r\ndebate, the Member for Thomson said that Malaysia is\r\n\r\nan anti-Indonesian move. That idea was not mentioned\r\n\r\nduring  the debate on the original motion on  merger\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation. Although  Malaysia  had  been\r\n\r\ntouched upon  - not at length, of course, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir;  the principle of it had been touched  upon  in\r\n\r\nthe first debate  - there was never any suggestion  by\r\n\r\nany  of  the  speakers  on  the  Barisan  side  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  was an anti-Indonesian move.  Now  I,  for\r\n\r\nmyself,  fail to understand how the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- particularly the Member for Thomson - could have said\r\n\r\nthat   it  was  an  anti-Indonesian  move  when   my\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the Malaysia proposals was that  it\r\n\r\nhad  the  blessing of the Indonesian  Government.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign  Minister  of Indonesia  has  stated  in  no\r\n\r\nuncertain   terms  that  insofar  as  the   Malaysia\r\n\r\nproposals   are   concerned,   Indonesia   has    no\r\n\r\nobjections.  Now  if  that is the  attitude  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Government, Mr Speaker, Sir, where  then\r\n\r\ndoes  the Member for Thomson get the idea that  this\r\n\r\nis  an  anti-Indonesian move? It seems  to  me  that\r\n\r\nthere  is something in what the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nhas been accusing the Barisan of, that this new line\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis, that this  is  an  anti-Indonesian  move, is a line which is being  dictated\r\n\r\nfrom  somebody  outside Singapore and not  connected\r\n\r\nwith  the Indonesian Government as a Government.  In\r\n\r\nview  of the article which appeared sometime ago  in\r\n\r\nthe  Straits Tunes and which set out the line of the\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party in Indonesia, and in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nstatement  made by the Member for Thomson subsequent\r\n\r\nto that, I get the impression  - unless they are going\r\n\r\nto  deny it with rational statement that that is not\r\n\r\nso -   that  they are following the line  set  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunist Party in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I hope for the sake of Singapore that\r\n\r\nit  is  nonsense. I was waiting for the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson,  when he made his speech on Friday evening,\r\n\r\nto  deny  that  statement. You will  recollect,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, that when the Member for Anson  moved\r\n\r\nhis  amendment,  he  did call upon  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson to give some explanation for that statement.\r\n\r\nI thought the Member for Thomson in his speech would\r\n\r\nmake  some reference to that and try to explain  it,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  think it is important for the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to know whether this is an anti-Indonesian\r\n\r\nmove  or not. If the Indonesian Government says that\r\n\r\nit  is not an anti-Indonesian move, why then are the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis worried about it? Surely it is  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore who elected them and  not  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Indonesia. Our main interest is  to  find\r\n\r\nout   first  whether  the  Malaysia  proposals   are\r\n\r\nsomething  good for Singapore. After that we  should\r\n\r\nconsider   whether  it  is  good  for  the   Bornean\r\n\r\nterritories   or  whether  it  is   good   for   the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI    would    have   thought   that,   as    elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the people  of  Singapore,  our\r\n\r\nfirst   duty   was  to  the  people  of   Singapore,\r\n\r\nafterwards to the Federation, and afterwards to  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories, and last of all  to  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nBut the point of attack in the Malaysia debate seems\r\n\r\nto  me that the Barisan Sosialis are more interested\r\n\r\nthan  the  people  of  Singapore  are  in  what  the\r\n\r\nCommunist   Party  in  Indonesia  think  about   the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  proposals. They are open to that criticism\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the statements made by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson and because he has not taken the trouble  to\r\n\r\ndeny it or explain it in any way to this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to put this\r\n\r\nproposition to the Barisan Sosialis and  what  their\r\n\r\nattitude  would  be on it. Sir, the Tunku  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  he  is not going to have Singapore  enter  the\r\n\r\nFederation  unless  and  until  the  three   Bornean\r\n\r\nterritories  come in at the same time. He  has  said\r\n\r\nthat most categorically, and he has not departed one\r\n\r\niota from that statement. But the Tunku has not said\r\n\r\nthat  if  the three Borneo territories agree  to  go\r\n\r\nwith   the  Federation  and  become  part   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation, he will not take them without Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo  there  is  this possibility that if  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories  agree to become part of the  Federation\r\n\r\nas  the  twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth  States,\r\n\r\nand  if  we lost on the referendum which God  forbid\r\n\r\nthem - we  might  reach  a position  where  the  three\r\n\r\nStates  in  Borneo become part of the  Federation - if\r\n\r\nnot   as  the  twelfth,  thirteenth  and  fourteenth\r\n\r\nStates, then at least on some other arrangement with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation - and with Singapore  staying  out  of\r\n\r\nthis  arrangement  as  an  active  opponent  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  concept. If that happened,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  ask  my friends in the Barisan Sosialis  to\r\n\r\nthink  of  the  pretty pickle Singapore  would  find\r\n\r\nitself  in.  And  if  there is no  merger  or  close\r\n\r\nunderstanding  or anything else with the  Federation\r\n\r\nas  a result of a refusal on the referendum, I think\r\n\r\nthat  slowly  but surely the pressure  on  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill be applied and it will find itself isolated. In\r\n\r\nthose circumstances, what solution\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  the Barisan Sosialis for Singapore? Do we  then\r\n\r\nsay  that we get the Internal Security Council  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  British and the Federation, keep internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  with the Singapore Government,  and  allow\r\n\r\nthe  British to continue to run the foreign  affairs\r\n\r\nand  defence  of  Singapore?  Is  that  a  practical\r\n\r\npossibility, Mr Speaker, Sir? Do they know  whether\r\n\r\nthe  British will agree to that? It is all very well\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Let the British defend us. Let the British\r\n\r\nrun  our  foreign  affairs.\"  But  can  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis give any assurance to the House that, under\r\n\r\nthe  conditions which I have just outlined  to  you,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  the British  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nremain here? I do not think the British will. If the\r\n\r\nBritish  are not going to remain here, who then  are\r\n\r\ngoing to look after our foreign affairs and defence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The P.K.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do not think the Indonesians want to\r\n\r\nbe mixed up with us. Now where do you go from there,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir? [Interruption] No, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe whole thing is impossible. And when one analyses\r\n\r\nthe arguments put forward by the Barisan Sosialis on\r\n\r\nthe  merger proposals with the Federation,  and  one\r\n\r\napplies  the  basis  of  those  arguments   to   the\r\n\r\narguments   which   they  use  on   these   Malaysia\r\n\r\nproposals, they conflict and cannot be reconciled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one gets the idea, therefore, that they are\r\n\r\nnot  being true to themselves in their arguments  on\r\n\r\nthis  issue  that  is  if  they  had  been  true  to\r\n\r\nthemselves in their arguments on the debate  on  the\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals. Now if there is this  falsity  of\r\n\r\narguments on these two issues, I think one must find\r\n\r\nout  what  has  caused this falsity of arguments.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Minister for Culture has a point when  he\r\n\r\nurges  upon  the  House  that  the  reason  for  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in  which  the Barisan  Sosialis  find\r\n\r\nthemselves  at  the  moment is  not  that  they  are\r\n\r\nfollowing  a  line of their own, but that  they  are\r\n\r\nfollowing  a line which someone else is setting  for\r\n\r\nthem. The Minister for Culture is suggesting to them\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  being sent by the Communist  Party  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia. Unless I hear anything further\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  this  from  the  Members  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  I myself will be inclined to  agree  with\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a further attack was made on the\r\n\r\nTunku  regarding the Commission that was  being  set\r\n\r\nup,  that  he was doing this without consulting  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  people. Sir, surely the whole point  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission  is to ascertain the views of the  people\r\n\r\nin  the  three territories of Borneo. I take it  the\r\n\r\nCommission   will  sit  in  each  of   these   three\r\n\r\nterritories.  The  Prime Minister knows  more  about\r\n\r\nthis than he would probably tell the House. But what\r\n\r\nI  expect,  and what would be the normal  procedure,\r\n\r\nwould be that the Commission goes from territory  to\r\n\r\nterritory  ascertaining the views of the  people  of\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo  territories and, on those  views,  they\r\n\r\nwill present the Commission's Report. So I really do\r\n\r\nnot  understand why the Barisan Sosialis should  say\r\n\r\nthat  the  Tunku is trying to rig the Commission  in\r\n\r\norder  that it might give him a favourable  verdict.\r\n\r\nWhat  the  Tunku has done, as I understand  it,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  is  that he has  given  the  Bornean\r\n\r\nterritories the maximum which Singapore is asking of\r\n\r\nhim.  Now if the Borneo territories do not want  the\r\n\r\nmaximum but they want something less, I feel certain\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku will accommodate them if that is the wish\r\n\r\nof the Borneo people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the Barisan Sosialis worried about?\r\n\r\nWhy  do  they  talk about elections first?  \"Let  us\r\n\r\nfirst have the three territories come in as one unit\r\n\r\nbefore  we  have  a  Malaysia merger.\"  Surely,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, anybody knows that those proposals, if\r\n\r\ncarried  out, will take at least another ten  years.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Cairnhill says more. Probably he  is\r\n\r\nright, but I say at least ten years. Can we wait for\r\n\r\nanother  ten  years? Can Singapore wait for  another\r\n\r\nten  years? Speaking for Singapore. I say we  cannot\r\n\r\nwait. I do not know about the Bornean territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, when there\r\n\r\nwas   a  Regional  Conference  of  the  Commonwealth\r\n\r\nParliamentary Association of which you were Chairman,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  urged upon the conference the necessity  to\r\n\r\nget  together quickly. That was sometime in July  or\r\n\r\nAugust  last year. I then urged upon the  conference\r\n\r\nthat the position of Singapore was such that it  was\r\n\r\nSingapore  that wished the getting together  quicker\r\n\r\nthan  any other part of this area which is now being\r\n\r\ncalled Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I say to Members of the Barisan Sosialis: let\r\n\r\nus  look after our own interests first, and think of\r\n\r\nsomebody else's afterwards. Our interests are  such,\r\n\r\neconomically,  politically and every  other  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich  this  Island is concerned,  that  the  coming\r\n\r\ntogether  with the Federation and the  three  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories is vital to our survival. Therefore, let\r\n\r\nus  get  on  with  it.  Let the Bornean  territories\r\n\r\ndecide what is best' for them and let the Commission\r\n\r\nhelp them decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it was curious that when the West Irian motion was being discussed - a matter which did not really concern the vital interests of Singapore - the P.A.P. Government, the Barisan Sosialis, the U.P.P. (who all originally started off in this House as P.A.P. Members) reached agreement on something which did not really concern Singapore. But on\r\n\r\nmatters  which  vitally concern our  existence  they\r\n\r\nwere  fighting  like cats and dogs, except  for  the\r\n\r\nU.P.P.,  of  course, who agreed. But so far  as  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  are concerned, they disagreed. I  think  we\r\n\r\nhave  reached  a stage in this House  where  if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. were to say something is white, the  Barisan\r\n\r\nare  going  to say that it is black; and  where  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  were to say it is yellow, the P.A.P. would\r\n\r\nsay  it  is red. I think it is a great pity we  have\r\n\r\nreached   this  stage  on  a  motion   of   national\r\n\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recollect another\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Member saying, \"We do not like this\r\n\r\nbecause  this  is something the P.A.P. has  brought\r\n\r\nabout.\"  That is one of the reasons given.  Now,  is\r\n\r\nthat a valid, substantial reason on a national issue\r\n\r\nsuch  as this? It is the good fortune of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto  be  the Government of the country at a  time  in\r\n\r\nhistory  when merger is becoming possible. But  that\r\n\r\nis  their  good fortune and it is not  due  to  them\r\n\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt  is  the  historical sequence of events  that  is\r\n\r\nbringing  merger about and it is their good  fortune\r\n\r\nto be at the right place at the right time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I tell my friends in the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis:  it is not a P.A.P. merger; it  is  not  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Malaysia. It is Malaysia as we all think  it\r\n\r\nshould  be;  that all these five territories  should\r\n\r\ncome  together.  We have been told how  we  will  be\r\n\r\naccepted into the Federation. The Tunku has told the\r\n\r\nBornean territories that he will accept them as  the\r\n\r\ntwelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth States,  if  they\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  it,  Mr Speaker, Sir,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nCommission will say so together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point they make, Sir, is a very\r\n\r\ninteresting  one. They say they are not  Communists.\r\n\r\nThey say they are not interested in a Communist form\r\n\r\nof government. They say they Want democracy. When we\r\n\r\nin Singapore talk about democracy, we talk about the\r\n\r\nparliamentary   form   of  democracy,   not   guided\r\n\r\ndemocracy or any other type of democracy.  Now,  one\r\n\r\nof  the  arguments  that the  Barisan  Sosialis  put\r\n\r\nforward  against Malaysia is this: that the Alliance\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  a  Right-wing government;  that  the\r\n\r\nAlliance  Government  is  a reactionary  government;\r\n\r\nthat the Alliance Government is this, that, and  the\r\n\r\nother. If the Barisan Sosialis genuinely believe  in\r\n\r\na  democratic form of government, there will  always\r\n\r\nbe a Right and a Left. They are all on the Left, and\r\n\r\nthe  Alliance is on the Right. Because the  Alliance\r\n\r\nis  on  the Right, and the people have put  them  in\r\n\r\npower,  therefore,  they are in  power  rightly.  It\r\n\r\nseems to me. Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Barisan  are\r\n\r\nnot  at all against Malaysia; really speaking,  they\r\n\r\nwant  Malaysia.  It  appears  to  me  that  had  the\r\n\r\nSocialist Front in the Federation been in  power  at\r\n\r\nthe  moment,  there would not have been this  20-day\r\n\r\ndebate over these two topics in this House. So  what\r\n\r\nthe Barisan are really saying is that they will only\r\n\r\nagree to a Malaysia or to a coming together with the\r\n\r\nFederation  only when a Left-wing government  is  in\r\n\r\npower in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Federation. That seems to be the whole point  of\r\n\r\nthe   attack.   If  they  really   believed   in   a\r\n\r\nparliamentary form of government, they should  agree\r\n\r\nto what is right for this whole area, and after that\r\n\r\nconvince the people that a Right-wing Government  is\r\n\r\nnot  in  the best interests of the whole  area,  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  is a Left-wing government that will  bring\r\n\r\nprosperity to this Island, to the Federation, and to\r\n\r\nthe  three  Borneo  territories. That  is  how  they\r\n\r\nshould do it if they were genuinely interested in  a\r\n\r\nparliamentary  form of democracy. But  as  they  are\r\n\r\nnot,  it  does appear to me that when they say,  \"We\r\n\r\nare  democrats,\" they are merely giving lip  service\r\n\r\nto  it at the moment because they cannot do anything\r\n\r\nelse now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to touch on\r\n\r\nanything  else on this debate. It has  gone  on  for\r\n\r\nthree or four days now. Everything that can be  said\r\n\r\nabout it has been said, and I do not wish to take up\r\n\r\nany  more time of the House. But I do say this: that\r\n\r\nin this debate, let us think of Singapore first, and\r\n\r\nlet  us  think of the Federation afterwards. Let  us\r\n\r\nthink of the three Borneo territories next, and  let\r\n\r\nus forget Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian (Punggol)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir from the speeches given by Members  of,\r\n\r\nthe  House  over  the last week, we  discover  three\r\n\r\ndifferent stands on Malaysia. These three stands are\r\n\r\nas  follows.  First  is  the  stand  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntogether  with the Alliance. They are in support  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysia  concept as planned by the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment. Second is that of the Barisan  Sosialis.\r\n\r\nThey  oppose  this  Malaysia  concept  without   any\r\n\r\nprinciples  whatsoever. They  are  blindly  opposing\r\n\r\nthis  Malaysia plan as brought up and  suggested  by\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\nclarification, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> The Member for Punggol says that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis are against  the  concept  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  In  fact,  we agree  to  the  concept  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, but it is the plan that we are against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

I do not want to argue with them  further\r\n\r\nin this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all the unprincipled opposition to the concept\r\n\r\nof   Malaysia  and  the  plan  as  proposed  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government is the second stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third stand is that of the U.P.P. together\r\n\r\nwith  the  Workers' Party in support of the Malaysia\r\n\r\nconcept but against the Malaysia plan as proposed by\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  Government.  Mr   Speaker,   Sir,\r\n\r\ngeographically, economically, culturally, Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  Malaya  together  with the  Borneo  territories\r\n\r\nbelong  to  the same family, just the  same  as  its\r\n\r\npeoples.  The  peoples have common cultures,  common\r\n\r\nraces  and use a common currency. They have  similar\r\n\r\nreligions,  they  have a common mode  of  life,  and\r\n\r\ntheir  separation  has  been brought  about  as  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  colonial rule. This  separation  of  the\r\n\r\npeoples in these five territories is a result of the\r\n\r\ndivide-and-rule policy of the colonialists. By  this\r\n\r\npolicy,  the colonialists could exploit the  peoples\r\n\r\nof  these five territories, and, therefore, in  this\r\n\r\npant of the world, when colonialism is dying out, we\r\n\r\ncan  say  that  the peoples of the five  territories\r\n\r\nmust gel together and rally under one flag to oppose\r\n\r\ntheir  common enemy. In this way we will be able  to\r\n\r\ngo forward with history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is the greatest producer of rubber and\r\n\r\ntin in the world. In Borneo there is a great deal of\r\n\r\nnatural resources waiting for the people to tap.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore we have many trained personnel and skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.  In addition, we have a very good port  and\r\n\r\nharbour facilities. In fact, we are the fifth  great\r\n\r\nport  in  the  world.  If the peoples  in  the  five\r\n\r\nterritories  can unite together, then they  will  be\r\n\r\nable to make full use of their natural resources and\r\n\r\ntheir  skilled  labour in order  to  bring  about  a\r\n\r\nbetter  future for the 10 million people  living  in\r\n\r\nthis  area.  That  is why we of the  U.P.P. are  in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Malaysia concept,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  this should be the natural development  for\r\n\r\nthis area. Unfortunately, it is disappointing for us\r\n\r\nto  note that during the debate on Malaysia in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  in the Federation Parliament, there  was\r\n\r\nopposition  to  the  concept of  Malaysia  from  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis and the P.M.I.P. We and the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare  quite different in our stands in this  respect.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  support the Malaysia concept,  we  are\r\n\r\nagainst the plan of the Federation of Malaya. We are\r\n\r\nopposed  to the merger proposals in the White  Paper\r\n\r\nbecause  we  believe that the peoples  of  the  five\r\n\r\nterritories should have a common citizenship so that\r\n\r\nthey  will  be able to visit one another freely  and\r\n\r\nthey  will also be able to live in the same  family.\r\n\r\nMoreover, they can look for jobs in any of the  five\r\n\r\nterritories without any restrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, last Thursday, I read in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers a report of the speech made by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi  in which he criticised the  U.P.P. for\r\n\r\ngiving  support to the P.A.P.'s motion. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this  is a very serious criticism.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand on what basis our friends in the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  made  the statement that we are  assisting\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. in deceiving the people of Singapore.  We\r\n\r\ncan  proudly tell the world that when my  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim, left this House  and  then\r\n\r\nreentered it again when he was re-elected,  he  went\r\n\r\nin  on  a  majority of about 4,000  votes  from  the\r\n\r\npeople.   So  when  the  Barisan  Sosialis  Members,\r\n\r\nwithout principles, oppose the Malaysia concept,  we\r\n\r\ncannot   but  feel  very  dissatisfied  with   their\r\n\r\nattitude. We thank them, of course, for reminding us\r\n\r\nnot  to fall into the trap of the P.A.P. But I  will\r\n\r\ntell the Barisan Sosialis Members that the political\r\n\r\nstand  of the U.P.P. cannot be influenced by anybody\r\n\r\nat all. It is because of the firm political stand of\r\n\r\nthe U.P.P. that we were able to campaign and win our\r\n\r\nstruggle  with the P.A.P. it is because of our  firm\r\n\r\npolitical stand that we were able to survive in  the\r\n\r\nHong Lim by-election. It is also because of our firm\r\n\r\npolitical  stand that we are now unlike  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership. We left the P.A.P. because we believe in\r\n\r\nour political stand. We are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  like  the  Members of the Barisan Sosialis  who\r\n\r\nonly  left the P.A.P. at a time when the P.A.P. ship\r\n\r\nwas  about  to  sink. The Hong Lim Resolutions  were\r\n\r\nbrought out because of our stand. The Members of the\r\n\r\nU.P.P. never change their political stand as  other\r\n\r\npolitical opportunists do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Hong Lim by-election, the people in the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis praised our Prime Minister. But all\r\n\r\nof  a  sudden,  and almost overnight,  they  changed\r\n\r\ntheir  stand. They now call themselves  the  friends\r\n\r\nand  heroes of the people. I believe that if victory\r\n\r\nin  the  by-election had gone to Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew,\r\n\r\nthen these people in the Barisan Sosialis would have\r\n\r\nremained in the P.A.P. Government even up till  now.\r\n\r\nThey would still have been with Mr Lee Kuan Yew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, regarding the Malaysia concept,\r\n\r\nI  beg  your  permission to  draw  an  analogy.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  if  you intend to have only two  children,\r\n\r\nand because of failure in birth control, you have  a\r\n\r\nthird child, then -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Speaker would far\r\n\r\nrather prefer that the simile be applied to somebody\r\n\r\nelse!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  that  case, I shall give an example  of  another\r\n\r\nperson.  Let us suppose that a person wants to  have\r\n\r\nonly  two  children. But unfortunately  because  the\r\n\r\nbirth-control  is  not effective,  he  has  a  third\r\n\r\nchild.  In that event, should he then give away  the\r\n\r\nthird  child  together with  the  first  two?  In  a\r\n\r\nsimilar  way,  support for the Malaysia  concept  is\r\n\r\njust  like  the analogy of having two children.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis say they want to have two children.\r\n\r\nBut  when they are going to have a third child, they\r\n\r\nsay  the  two children already born should be  given\r\n\r\naway, together with the unwanted third child. Let me\r\n\r\nremind  them that the Malaysia concept is one thing,\r\n\r\nbut  the  Malaysia plan is quite another  thing.  We\r\n\r\nmust  see  clearly the object of our opposition  and\r\n\r\nour objections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Anson moved an amendment to\r\n\r\nthe original motion, what he wanted to do was to ask\r\n\r\nthe  House  to  support unanimously the  concept  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  His attitude is correct. That is  why  he\r\n\r\nhas  our support. But what we heard from the Barisan\r\n\r\nis  the  concept  of  Greater Malaysia  which  would\r\n\r\ninclude Indonesia, Singapore, the Borneo territories\r\n\r\nand the Federation. We never deny that Indonesia  is\r\n\r\nour friend and a good neighbour. We should always be\r\n\r\nfriendly towards Indonesia and regard it as our  own\r\n\r\nbrother.  To he friendly is one thing, but to  merge\r\n\r\nwith Indonesia is another thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China and Russia are just like America and\r\n\r\nBritain.  They are very friendly. But  it  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  two  countries  should  merge.  Although\r\n\r\npolitically,  economically and culturally  Indonesia\r\n\r\nhas  many  things in common with us, there are  some\r\n\r\ndifferences.   Therefore,  we  cannot   merge   with\r\n\r\nIndonesia. Let me tell my Barisan friends again that\r\n\r\nwe   cannot   by   ourselves  bring  prosperity   to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  we hope that they  will  not  bring\r\n\r\ndisaster to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  Malaysia  offers to the people  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSarawak, Borneo. Brunei and Malaya a great future, a\r\n\r\nfuture    full   of   opportunities   and    immense\r\n\r\npotentialities. Therefore, it is desirable and vital\r\n\r\nthat these opportunities should not be lost and that\r\n\r\nthe  creation of Malaysia be realised without delay.\r\n\r\nWhen  established, Malaysia will  be  a  stabilising\r\n\r\nforce  in South-East Asia. We in Singapore are  very\r\n\r\nfortunate to occupy an advantageous position, and we\r\n\r\nwill have an important role to play in the future of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  The  main opposition to  the  concept  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  within and outside these five  territories\r\n\r\nhas  been Communist-inspired. In Singapore and  here\r\n\r\nin   this   Chamber,  the  Barisan   Sosialis   have\r\n\r\nchampioned  the  Communist  cause.  They  say   that\r\n\r\nMalaysia is British-sponsored and supported  by  the\r\n\r\nTunku. What is wrong with it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey say it is anti-Indonesia and is detrimental  to\r\n\r\nthe  advancement of our people. The  truth  is  that\r\n\r\nMalaysia will be a setback to the Communists. It  is\r\n\r\nfor  this  reason that they and the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  opposed  it  bitterly for  their  own  selfish\r\n\r\ninterest.  When Malaysia is firmly established,  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and their followers will have  no  place\r\n\r\nand   no  chance  to  advance  their  interest   and\r\n\r\nideology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Barisan Sosialis have repeatedly\r\n\r\ncriticised   the   Government  Front   Benches   for\r\n\r\nsupporting merger and Malaysia, saying that they  do\r\n\r\nso  in order to satisfy their own interest, which is\r\n\r\nto remain in power. For the benefit of everyone, let\r\n\r\nme  state  clearly here that none of the  26  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMembers  who have remained loyal to the  people  who\r\n\r\nhave  elected  them to this Chamber  would  wish  to\r\n\r\nremain  here longer than is necessary,  and  for  no\r\n\r\nother  reason than our firm conviction that Malaysia\r\n\r\nis  in the interest of our people. We would like  to\r\n\r\nsee  merger  and  Malaysia through to  a  successful\r\n\r\nconclusion.  It is our duty to see that  mischievous\r\n\r\npeople  like  the Barisan Sosialis do not  have  the\r\n\r\nchance to wreck it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments of Members of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare  most childish and absurd. They accuse the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and other Ministers of wanting to remain in\r\n\r\npower,  and  that  is the reason  why  they  support\r\n\r\nmerger  and Malaysia. Why should the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand  other  Ministers  face all  the  unpleasantness\r\n\r\ncreated  by the Barisan Sosialis and their Communist\r\n\r\nmasters just to support merger and Malaysia?  If  it\r\n\r\nis  true  that they are power crazy, would they  not\r\n\r\ntake  the  easiest way out like the 13  Members  who\r\n\r\nhave  defected and formed the Barisan Sosialis,  and\r\n\r\nsuccumb  to  the demands of the six trade unionists?\r\n\r\nThen  all  would  be well. Then there  would  be  no\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis today and the 13 Members would  not\r\n\r\nhave  crossed  the Floor. Fortunately, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I am glad the Ministerial Front Benches are not\r\n\r\nmen made of straw who would break so easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis and their Communist masters\r\n\r\noppose Malaysia. But what is their alternative? They\r\n\r\nsay, let the peoples of the three Borneo territories\r\n\r\nhave  self-determination first  and  then  they  can\r\n\r\ndecide   for   themselves.  In  the  meantime,   the\r\n\r\nCommunists can advance their ideology and  interests\r\n\r\nin   these   territories.  We  can  appreciate   and\r\n\r\nunderstand the anxiety of the peoples in the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories  in wanting time to make up their  minds\r\n\r\nand so prepare themselves for the role they have  to\r\n\r\nplay  in Malaysia. To those of us who have been over\r\n\r\nto  the Borneo territories, we know that the peoples\r\n\r\nthere  are  not accustomed to the fast pace  we  are\r\n\r\nused to here. But I am sure they do not realise  the\r\n\r\ndanger awaiting them. It is on this pretext that the\r\n\r\nCommunists  have strongly championed  the  cause  of\r\n\r\nself-determination for their own selfish interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the ordinary man in the street\r\n\r\nor in the coffee-shop would like to know what merger\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia mean. Do these affect their lives  and\r\n\r\ntheir  livelihood? Through Malaysia the  peoples  of\r\n\r\nthese  five territories will be integrated into  one\r\n\r\ncommon political unit and share a common destiny. We\r\n\r\nhave  strong historical, cultural and economic  ties\r\n\r\nwhich  make  us fit in as a group. When  the  people\r\n\r\ncried  for  merdeka, the British cunningly separated\r\n\r\nus in their own interests. The time has now come for\r\n\r\nus  to  reunite  into  one political  unit  for  the\r\n\r\nadvancement of our own peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia will accelerate the economic and rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  educational  advancement  of   the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories. Most of our public services  are\r\n\r\nat  present operated on a Pan Malayan/Borneo  basis,\r\n\r\nthe  agreements on which will have to  be  concluded\r\n\r\nwith  the  consent  of  all five  Governments.  With\r\n\r\nMalaysia  under  a  strong Central Government,  this\r\n\r\nwill  help  to  improve  and expand  public  utility\r\n\r\nservices.

Do  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis believe in the democratic socialist\r\n\r\nsystem,  or  are they advocating a Communist  system\r\n\r\nfor Malaysia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Malaysia is a constructive\r\n\r\napproach to the unity and well-being of our peoples.\r\n\r\nI fully endorse it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in debating the Greater Malaysia Plan,\r\n\r\nmy  Party's  Chairman,  the Member  for  Queenstown,\r\n\r\nComrade  Lee  Siew  Choh, has clearly  analysed  the\r\n\r\nadvantages  and disadvantages of the  Plan  for  the\r\n\r\npeople. After the analysis we have made, what he has\r\n\r\nsaid  is  true. This Plan will not be beneficial  to\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. We have dealt a heavy blow\r\n\r\nto  the  P.A.P. From speeches made by the Ministers,\r\n\r\nwe  can  see that they are not analysing the problem\r\n\r\nof  Greater  Malaysia. They have always accused  us,\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis, of being  Communist-inspired\r\n\r\nand  stooges  of  the Communists. So  they  are  not\r\n\r\nanalysing  the problems, hut are only  accusing  us.\r\n\r\nThis  method  is  meant to confuse and  mislead  the\r\n\r\npeople on this issue and to silence them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the P.A.P. leadership has forgotten, that\r\n\r\nin  1948,  the  colonial government  used  the  same\r\n\r\ntactics of abusing and criticising those who opposed\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule. They even arrested the people.  What\r\n\r\nwas  the result? They could not suppress the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore forever. As a result, there came  into\r\n\r\nbeing the Rendel Constitution. We are not forgetful.\r\n\r\nUnder the Rendel Constitution, the puppet government\r\n\r\nof Lim Yew Hock used the same tactics and methods to\r\n\r\ncriticise their political opponents and suppress the\r\n\r\nprogressive  organisations.  They  came  to  a  very\r\n\r\ndisastrous end. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleadership are using the same tactics to  accuse  us\r\n\r\nof  many  things,  but the people will  not  believe\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At every street corner in Singapore, we see the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are  putting  up  bunting  and  posters  for\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Week. They are carrying out  a  propaganda\r\n\r\ncampaign to stir up the people and win them over  to\r\n\r\ntheir  side. The P.A.P. have been carrying out  this\r\n\r\nline  of  propaganda for quite some time.  They  are\r\n\r\nusing  this  as  a political panacea to  save  their\r\n\r\npolitical  future. They are now putting  up  bunting\r\n\r\nand  decorations in every street and every  building\r\n\r\nin  conjunction  with Malaysia Week,  thinking  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  make the people believe that  the  future\r\n\r\nMalaysia  will be as beautiful as these decorations.\r\n\r\nThey  hope  the people can be trapped  by  all  this\r\n\r\noutward   manifestation  and  propaganda.  If   this\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan is in the interest of the people,  it\r\n\r\nneeds  no propaganda to sell it. A plan that  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  the people and is  good  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the State needs no slogans, dramas  and\r\n\r\nstage  plays  to sell it. These things  are  only  a\r\n\r\nwaste of time, energy and money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can all remember that the\r\n\r\nMalaysia concept was first mooted by the progressive\r\n\r\nLeft-wing  people.  The  original  Malaysia  concept\r\n\r\nincluded Malaya, Singapore, the Borncan territories,\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and the Philippines. Its purpose  was  to\r\n\r\noppose  Western colonial exploitation  and  rule  in\r\n\r\nthis  area, to strengthen and consolidate the people\r\n\r\nof  South-East  Asia against colonial  rule  and  to\r\n\r\npromote a world-wide anti-colonial movement,  so  as\r\n\r\nto  contribute  part of its strength  to  the  world\r\n\r\nmovement against colonialism. But all this could not\r\n\r\nbe  achieved under the present Malaysia Plan,  which\r\n\r\nis   in  the  interest  of  the  colonialists.  This\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan will consolidate the colonial  forces\r\n\r\nand spread the Right- wing reactionary influence  in\r\n\r\nthese five territories in order to suppress the anti-colonial  movement and struggle. At the  same  time,\r\n\r\nthe Right-wing colonial forces, under the protection\r\n\r\nof  the colonialists, will be able to continue their\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  these  five territories,  so  that  the\r\n\r\ncolonial master can hide behind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Right-wing stooges and direct them to  continue\r\n\r\nto  exploit the people of these territories  and  to\r\n\r\ncontinue their colonial rule in this area. Thus  the\r\n\r\nBritish colonialists can have their vested interests\r\n\r\nin this area preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the beginning of this\r\n\r\nyear, the anti-colonial forces are mounting in these\r\n\r\nterritories.  For  example,  the  people  have  been\r\n\r\nfighting  for the liberation of West Irian and  Goa.\r\n\r\nThis  shows  the mounting force of anti-colonialism.\r\n\r\nThis  also shows that the people under colonial rule\r\n\r\nwant  to  free themselves. We can see that  even  in\r\n\r\nterritories  like Brunei and Sarawak the  forces  of\r\n\r\nanti-colonialism are still increasing. Every day the\r\n\r\nanti-colonial movement is gaining momentum and  they\r\n\r\nare   demanding  a  national  referendum  on   self-determination.  But the colonialists,  fearing  that\r\n\r\nthey  may  fail  in  the general elections  and  the\r\n\r\nnational referendum, have postponed these events  in\r\n\r\norder  to perpetuate their rule. We can clearly  see\r\n\r\nfrom these facts that the Greater Malaysia Plan does\r\n\r\nnot aim at promoting the interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nthe  five  territories. In fact, this Plan  aims  at\r\n\r\nfrustrating the anti-colonial movement in the  three\r\n\r\nterritories  in  Borneo.  If  this  Plan  is  really\r\n\r\nintended  to bring about prosperity and  to  promote\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the people in the five  territories\r\n\r\nof this region, the rulers must first let the people\r\n\r\nin the three territories in Borneo have independence\r\n\r\nbefore  they can bring about the Malaysia  Plan.  If\r\n\r\nthis  Plan  is to be put into practice  quietly  and\r\n\r\nhanded  to  a Right-wing Government as  a  means  of\r\n\r\nruling  the  people in the five territories  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the colonialists, then it will not be in\r\n\r\nthe interest of the people in the five territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot forget that the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the Federation, Tunku Abdul Rahman,  has\r\n\r\nsaid that under the Greater Malaysia Plan, Singapore\r\n\r\nwill only be taken in on a partnership basis. As far\r\n\r\nas   immigration  is  concerned,   there   will   be\r\n\r\nrestrictions in the five territories. But the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave been boasting that Malaysia will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlook after the interest of the 10 million people  in\r\n\r\nthese territories and that it will be a solution  to\r\n\r\nall the problems of the people in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government is now\r\n\r\nlaunching   an  intensive  propaganda  campaign   to\r\n\r\ndeceive the people on the question of Malaysia. When\r\n\r\nMalaysia is realised, unemployed people in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  allowed  to  migrate  to  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories  to seek jobs. So how can  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nPlan  solve  the unemployment problem in Singapore'?\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. say that they can do so, but it is a lie.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is no difference whatsoever between the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan and the merger proposals as contained\r\n\r\nin the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we say that this Malaysia Plan is impractical\r\n\r\nand we will not support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,\r\n\r\nafter  the Second World War, we notice two political\r\n\r\ntrends:  (1)  colonies gradually  gain  independence\r\n\r\nfrom imperial rule, and (2) small countries tend  to\r\n\r\nunite together in order to survive and prosper. This\r\n\r\ntrend  of countries coming together is found in  the\r\n\r\nWest Indies and in Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people who live in the\r\n\r\nterritories comprising Malaysia have much in common.\r\n\r\nThe  concept  of Malaysia is a natural expansion  of\r\n\r\nthe concept of a united Malaya with the three Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories.  My  Party, the United People's  Party,\r\n\r\nsupports  the  concept  of Malaysia  as  the  United\r\n\r\nPeople's  Party  supports the concept  of  a  united\r\n\r\nMalaya.  Unfortunately, the Federation  Government's\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan  would not bring  about  a  true  and\r\n\r\nreunited  Malaysia  as  Singapore  would   only   be\r\n\r\nadmitted on a so-called partnership basis. In  order\r\n\r\nto create a true Malaysia, two basic conditions must\r\n\r\nbe  observed:  firstly, there  must  be  one  common\r\n\r\ncitizenship, and, secondly, there must be freedom of\r\n\r\ntravel  and  residence  within  all  the  15  States\r\n\r\ncomprising Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We oppose the Plan put forward by the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  because it is against  these  two  basic\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, we support the concept of Malaysia, but we\r\n\r\nare  opposed to the Federation Plan because it would\r\n\r\nnot bring about a true Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a true Malaysia will bring much\r\n\r\nbenefit  to  the people of Singapore and will  solve\r\n\r\nmany  of  her  economic problems. For  more  than  a\r\n\r\ncentury,  Singapore  has  been  the  heart  of   the\r\n\r\nterritories   which  comprise   Malaysia.   A   true\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  when created, will therefore  be  in  the\r\n\r\nbest interest of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the original motion moved by the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  of Singapore asks the  Assembly  to\r\n\r\nsupport   the   Malaysia  Plan  of  the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The amendment suggested by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson asks the Assembly to support the Malaysia\r\n\r\nconcept  instead  of agreeing with  the  Plan.  This\r\n\r\nMalaysia concept has been approved by all Parties in\r\n\r\nthe Federal Parliament, including the P.P.P. and the\r\n\r\nSocialist  Front,  but  has  been  opposed  by   the\r\n\r\nP.M.I.P.   The   P.M.I.P. wants   the   territories\r\n\r\ncomprising Malaysia to be merged with Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Singapore Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly, it seems that all the Parties, except  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, support the Malaysia concept.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  claim that  the  U.P.P. and  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party have fallen into the propaganda  trap\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. and have helped the P.A.P. to deceive\r\n\r\nthe  people. Mr Speaker, Sir, since we  fought  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership from the days  of  the  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nResolutions,  we  have never on any occasion  fallen\r\n\r\ninto  the  P.A.P. trap. Neither have we  helped  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership to deceive the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was the Barisan Sosialis, as ex-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMembers, who as late as the polling day of the  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  by-election helped the P.A.P. to  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople.  They  helped  the  P.A.P. in  their  false\r\n\r\npropaganda  to deceive the people in the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly,  in  the  meetings at  the  Hong  Lim  by-election and elsewhere. They sang the praises of the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and flattered him as a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemocrat, socialist and a man of the masses.  Within\r\n\r\na  few weeks after the Prime Minister's catastrophic\r\n\r\ndefeat  in Hong Lim, these same people, who  claimed\r\n\r\nthat  the Prime Minister was a good, honest democrat\r\n\r\nand   socialist,  turned  against  him  and  started\r\n\r\nrepeating  the same things that we said. Instead  of\r\n\r\nbeing  collaborators,  the  Barisan  Sosialis   have\r\n\r\nassumed  a  new role. They have become the so-called\r\n\r\nchampions of the people. Can the people trust  these\r\n\r\npolitical weathercocks? Is it not a fact that  these\r\n\r\nBarisan  Assemblymen collaborated  with  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership for two years, enjoying life together? Is\r\n\r\nit necessary to quote what they said in Hong Lim? On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, we in the U.P.P. do not change like\r\n\r\nthese  political  weathercocks. We have  fought  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. constantly  and have not  collaborated  with\r\n\r\nthem in deceiving the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Malaysia concept, it is\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis who will fall into the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntrap.  I  remember  not long  ago  how  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  fell  into the P.A.P. trap  by  supporting\r\n\r\npolice action against students. They also fell  into\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. trap by sending a delegate to the Malayan\r\n\r\nSolidarity  Consultative Conference. The  U.P.P. is\r\n\r\nopposed  to the Malaysia Plan as distinct  from  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia concept. Also we would have nothing  to  do\r\n\r\nwith    the    Malaysia   Solidarity    Consultative\r\n\r\nConference. Participation meant acceptance. Sir, why\r\n\r\ndo  the  Barisan Sosialis often fall into the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntrap  in  this Assembly and elsewhere?  One  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons   is  that  they  have  no  fixed  political\r\n\r\nprinciples - just changing their stand like  political\r\n\r\nweathercocks. From the speeches, it seems  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is prepared to accept the amendment  of  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson because the Barisan Sosialis  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to  vote  against the amended  motion.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  trap  is  to isolate the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nfrom  the national movement and, as is clearly seen,\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis is plunging headlong into  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. trap. We in the U.P.P. have more  principles\r\n\r\nand   more   experience  in  fighting   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership, even during the time when they  were  at\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nheight  of  their  power and when  there  were  some\r\n\r\npeople   who   were  prepared  to   compromise   and\r\n\r\ncollaborate with the mighty Prime Minister  then  in\r\n\r\norder to share the spoils and glory of power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we support the Malaysia concept.\r\n\r\nWe  oppose  the  plan put forward by the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  because  it  will  not  create  a   true\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  We  also oppose merging  with  Indonesia,\r\n\r\nalthough  we want to be friendly with the Indonesian\r\n\r\npeople.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, therefore there was chaos and disorder\r\n\r\nin  this country. Whose fault is it? It is the fault\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis. Many people outside  this\r\n\r\nHouse  say  that  if  the  Members  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  had not left the P.A.P., then there  would\r\n\r\nhave been stability and peace in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the U.P.P. also asked why should they,\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis, leave the P.A.P.? At that time\r\n\r\nthey  wanted to oppose the U.P.P. and now they  want\r\n\r\nto  oppose  the  P.A.P. Now, who  has  been  playing\r\n\r\ngames?  Why should the Barisan Sosialis be political\r\n\r\nturn-coats?  They have no political objectives,  but\r\n\r\nare  waverers so they could bring chaos and disorder\r\n\r\nto  the people and the State. The people do not want\r\n\r\nto  study  and  workers do not want to  work.  Whose\r\n\r\nfault  is  it?  The  Member for Anson  supports  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's Greater Malaysia Plan. But they say\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  wrong to do so. Then why should they support\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson at the Anson by-election?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nshould   not   be  so  obstinate  in  opposing   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  hope they could contribute  concrete\r\n\r\nand  constructive suggestions and not  engage  in  a\r\n\r\nrambling debate in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support merger between Singapore and the\r\n\r\nFederation  and also the Malaysia Plan.  Why  should\r\n\r\nthere  be  merger and why should there be a Malaysia\r\n\r\nPlan?  We  can  see that taxi-drivers  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot ply in the Federation. What is the reason for\r\n\r\nthis?  Graduates of Nanyang University cannot go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  The reason is  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nmerger. That is why we want merger. After merger  we\r\n\r\nare  members  of the same family and we  can  travel\r\n\r\nfreely  in Malaya. But the Barisan Sosialis want  to\r\n\r\noppose   merger.  They  say  the  people   are   not\r\n\r\nsatisfied.  Here  and there in the streets  and  the\r\n\r\ncoffee-shops   people  are  accusing   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  because they have taken  the  wrong  path.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  politics? Politics means  support  by  the\r\n\r\npeople.  But  the people do not support the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  What is their reason for opposing  merger\r\n\r\nand  the Malaysia Plan? They are trying to fool  the\r\n\r\npeople.  They  are  only  looking  after  their  own\r\n\r\ninterests.  That is why the people  do  not  support\r\n\r\nthem  because  they are thought to be  arrogant  and\r\n\r\nproud.  They  also try to create strikes  here  arid\r\n\r\nthere.  The people are not pleased with the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  That is why they do not want  to  support\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis. They say  that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are doing things contrary to the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  The  people have  also  asked  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis not to place party politics  above\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the people.

It  is  a  strange\r\n\r\naccusation. We have already clearly declared in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  and  in this House that we  support  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian claim to West Irian. Yet this  Member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  accused  us  of  opposing  Indonesia's\r\n\r\nliberation of West Irian. Is it not a lie when  this\r\n\r\nMember  said that we would not support Indonesia?  I\r\n\r\nwould  stress  again  that we support  Indonesia  in\r\n\r\ntheir  claim to West Irian, but we must not by doing\r\n\r\nso  let West Irian be a battlefield. It will not  be\r\n\r\nin  the  interests of anyone. We  must  not  let  it\r\n\r\nbecome  a  kind  of sacrifice on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  people.  We  have  seen  such  a   thing\r\n\r\nhappening in the past. For instance, Communist China\r\n\r\nwanted  to  reclaim Formosa but could not declare  a\r\n\r\nwar because it was an international issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It goes  to\r\n\r\nshow  that all along our Party has been on the right\r\n\r\nlines.  We  are nationalists and all along  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  struggling  against  colonial  domination  and\r\n\r\ncolonial  interests. But they  have  accused  us  of\r\n\r\nbeing   Right-wing   people   and   supporting   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  All this is not true. We  have  never\r\n\r\ndone  such  a  thing.

It  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  very clear, Mr Speaker, why  they  oppose\r\n\r\nmerger between Singapore and the Federation and  the\r\n\r\nrealisation  of Malaysia, and why in  an  effort  to\r\n\r\nbreak up merger and Malaya they are trying to create\r\n\r\nconfusion  among  the  people  by  falsehoods.   The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis have been accusing the  P.A.P. of\r\n\r\nnegotiating a sell-out merger. The Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nare also saying that Malaysia is also a sell-out  of\r\n\r\nsome  kind to the British. But their antics  at  the\r\n\r\nSocialists  Conference in Kuala Lumpur make  it  all\r\n\r\ntoo  clear that it is the Barisan Sosialis which  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to sell out the people of Singapore and  the\r\n\r\n10  million  people  of Malaya to  the  P.K.I.,  the\r\n\r\nCommunists in Indonesia. First, they tried  to  sell\r\n\r\nout Singapore to the British colonialists. They know\r\n\r\nthat   merger   with  the  Federation   will   bring\r\n\r\nindependence to Singapore by ending British rule  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  Barisan Sosialis cannot  deny  this\r\n\r\nlogic.  Once there is merger, the British will  have\r\n\r\nno  say either in the domestic or foreign affairs of\r\n\r\na  United Malaya. But what did the anti-colonialists\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis do? They secretly went  to\r\n\r\nsee officials of the U.K. Commission and put forward\r\n\r\na  funny deal. They said they were prepared  to  let\r\n\r\nthe  British  have  control over  the  military  and\r\n\r\nexternal affairs of Singapore in return for internal\r\n\r\nself-government minus the Internal Security Council;\r\n\r\nnot   full  independence  through  merger  but  only\r\n\r\ninternal   self-government.  In  other  words,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso-called anti-colonial nationalists of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  were  prepared to sell out our  chance  of\r\n\r\nindependence  to  the  British  in  return  for  the\r\n\r\nabolition of the Internal Security Council.  Why  do\r\n\r\nthey  want  the  abolition of the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil?  Why  are they prepared  to  sell  out  the\r\n\r\nchance  of independence for Singapore in return  for\r\n\r\nthe  abolition of the Internal Security Council?  It\r\n\r\nis  because  they  know that the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  prevents  the  Communists  from  trying  to\r\n\r\nsubvert  and destroy Singapore. They know  that  the\r\n\r\nexistence  of  the  internal  security  laws  in  an\r\n\r\nindependent   and  united  Malaya  would   be   most\r\n\r\ndisastrous   for   the  cause  of   Communism.   The\r\n\r\nCommunists  know  that  in  an  independent   united\r\n\r\nMalaya,  they  will  meet with resistance  from  the\r\n\r\nnationalists  if  they try to  set  up  a  Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya.  They  know  that they cannot  extend  their\r\n\r\ninfluence   under  the  cloak  of  anti-colonialism.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they would rather prefer that the British\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   rule  Singapore   and   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories for a while. Then in that situation they\r\n\r\ncan  use  the  cloak of anti-colonialism  to  extend\r\n\r\ntheir  influence in Malaysia. As you know, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  have lost the battle  for  merger\r\n\r\njust  as  they  have steadily been losing  in  their\r\n\r\ncampaign to bust up Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their desperation, the Barisan Sosialis are now\r\n\r\nembarking  on  a really big sell-out. They  are  now\r\n\r\nplanning  to  sell  us to the P.K.I.  They  are  now\r\n\r\nlooking  to  the P.K.I. to help them  out  of  their\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  They  want to break  up  Malaysia  in\r\n\r\norder  to keep it weak and divided, so that  through\r\n\r\nthe  P.K.I. these territories could be subverted and\r\n\r\nthen  swallowed up one by one with the  aid  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that sometime ago, there\r\n\r\nwas   a   report   in  an  Indonesian  pro-Communist\r\n\r\nnewspaper,   the   Bintang  Timur.  This   newspaper\r\n\r\nreported  Mr  Lim  Ching Siong as  saying  that  he\r\n\r\npreferred a merger of Singapore with Indonesia to  a\r\n\r\nmerger  with the Federation of Malaya. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nhe  denied this report later on. But it is clear now\r\n\r\nthat even if the report was untrue,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Bintang Timur had read the mind of Mr Lim Ching\r\n\r\nSiong and the Barisan Sosialis. The P.K.I. has since\r\n\r\nthen  passed  a resolution denouncing  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nmerger.  Some  of the Barisan Sosialis leaders  have\r\n\r\nclaimed that the fact that they are against Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  the  fact  that the P.K.I. is against  Malaysia\r\n\r\ndoes  not  therefore mean that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nare  following a pro-Communist policy  too.  Is  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  they ask, branding all who oppose  Malaysia\r\n\r\nas   Communists?  The  P.A.P. has  always  made   a\r\n\r\ndistinction between non-Communists who are  critical\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia  and even opposed to Malaysia  and  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   who   are  opposed  to   Malaysia.   We\r\n\r\nunderstand  the sincerity of the non-Communists  who\r\n\r\nare  critical or opposed to Malaysia. We think  they\r\n\r\nare  wrong  in fearing Malaysia. It was  these  non-Communist  anti-Malaysia elements to whom we  wanted\r\n\r\nto  talk at the recent Malaysia Socialist Conference\r\n\r\nheld  in Kuala Lumpur. We wanted at least to try  to\r\n\r\nconvince  them  both as socialist  and  nationalists\r\n\r\nthat  they  had everything to gain by Malaysia.  The\r\n\r\nCommunist elements in the Barisan Sosialis, or  what\r\n\r\nshould  be  more correctly described as the  Barisan\r\n\r\nCommunists, knew this. They were so scared of  being\r\n\r\nexposed  that they managed to rig up the  conference\r\n\r\nin  such  a  way that our working paper  giving  the\r\n\r\nsocialist  approach to Malaysia was  rejected.  They\r\n\r\ndid  not  even  give us a chance to explain  to  the\r\n\r\nconference why our paper should be considered. After\r\n\r\nall,  Mr Speaker, we did not object to the adoption\r\n\r\nof  the working paper of the Barisan Sosialis though\r\n\r\nthat paper was a vicious and malicious attack on the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government and some of its leaders. We  knew\r\n\r\nthat  in an open debate, we could expose the  merits\r\n\r\nand  falsehoods in the Barisan Sosialis  paper.  But\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  in  the Barisan  Sosialis  were  so\r\n\r\nscared   of  even  adopting  our  paper  that   they\r\n\r\nprevailed  upon  the unhappy Chairman  not  only  to\r\n\r\nreject   our  paper  but  also  to  refuse   us   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  explain why  our  paper  should  be\r\n\r\naccepted.  This  suppression of  free  speech  came,\r\n\r\noddly  enough,  Mr Speaker, immediately  after  the\r\n\r\nconference had passed a resolution defending freedom\r\n\r\nof the Press. I repeat - freedom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the Press. The pro-Communists believe in freedom\r\n\r\nof  the Press, but not in freedom of speech for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. They dare not allow free speech, moreover, in\r\n\r\na  conference packed with cheer leaders who had come\r\n\r\nto  boo and shout down the P.A.P. delegates. But the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was nevertheless prepared to speak freely  to\r\n\r\nthe  non-Communist socialists at the  conference  in\r\n\r\norder  to  convince them of our  point  of  view  on\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  The conference Chairman said that  though\r\n\r\nthe  paper  would  not be adopted, we  could  debate\r\n\r\nMalaysia  later on. But it is unusual. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nin  a democratic conference that all papers but  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  paper should be adopted. The Chairman  was\r\n\r\neven prepared to consider a paper which the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty Chairman proposed to submit. The Chairman  had\r\n\r\nnot  even  seen  that paper. This is  the  so-called\r\n\r\ndemocracy in which they believe. The truth  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Communists were so uncertain of  the  case  for\r\n\r\nMalaysia  that they dare not allow a  paper  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to he adopted for discussion on Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is only a foretaste of the\r\n\r\nkind  of  freedom we could hope to get in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  in Malaysia if the Barisan Sosialis were to get\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  this  country.  Why  were  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  so scared of our working paper  that  they\r\n\r\nmanoeuvred to get our paper rejected? When  we  went\r\n\r\nto   the   meeting   of   the  Malaysia   Solidarity\r\n\r\nConsultative  Committee meetings in Kuching  and  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur, we were not afraid, Mr  Speaker,  to\r\n\r\ntake  the  Member for Thomson along  with  us,  even\r\n\r\nthough  we knew that he was really against Malaysia.\r\n\r\nHe  had  every  chance to say what  he  liked  about\r\n\r\nMalaysia and the P.A.P. in Kuching. If he was silent\r\n\r\nfor  most  of the time, it was because he knew  that\r\n\r\nwhatever false or illogical things he said could  be\r\n\r\nimmediately challenged and exposed. It is clear from\r\n\r\nthe  resolutions  passed after the  P.A.P. walk-out\r\n\r\nthat  that conference was rigged in order to  enable\r\n\r\nthe   Communists  at  the  conference  to  trap  the\r\n\r\nconfused  and misled non-Communists who  were  there\r\n\r\ninto  endorsing the P.K.I.'s resolutions. We are  of\r\n\r\nthe view that the Communists are attempting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  use genuine fears about Malaysia to organise  an\r\n\r\nanti-Malaysia campaign to further the  ambitions  of\r\n\r\nthe P.K.I. in this region. This is the biggest sell-out  of  the Barisan Sosialis. They have become  the\r\n\r\nstooges  of  the Indonesian Communists and  are  now\r\n\r\nengaged  in a treasonable plot to sell out Singapore\r\n\r\nand Malaysia to the P.K.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  miscalculated. They will  not  only  earn  the\r\n\r\ncontempt but also the anger of the people. They will\r\n\r\nbe  rejected  by the people because the people  will\r\n\r\nnot  back  a  Party  which  in  its  desperation  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to  sell  us  to  the  cause  of   foreign\r\n\r\nCommunism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we of the Barisan Sosialis resolutely\r\n\r\nand  wholeheartedly oppose the motion on the Greater\r\n\r\nMalaysia Plan moved by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that this motion is similar to the motion\r\n\r\non the White Paper on merger. There is no difference\r\n\r\nat  all between these two motions. At the same time,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot accept the amendment moved by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson. We are of the opinion that the amendment\r\n\r\nof  the  Member  for  Anson  has  not  fundamentally\r\n\r\nchanged  the character of the motion tabled in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  Ministers of t1ie Government, together  with\r\n\r\nthe  Back-benches, have made many allegations during\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches. They have said that it is only  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis who are opposed to this motion.  We\r\n\r\nwill tell them that our stand is very clear. We will\r\n\r\ndo  whatever  we  think is right. We  will  also  do\r\n\r\nwhatever  is  in  the  interest  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We   will  oppose  anything   that   is\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the people of Singapore,  as  we  did\r\n\r\nwith the merger motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have seen that the Four-Party Alliance\r\n\r\nare  supporting the P.A.P. motion. It is no surprise\r\n\r\nto  us  because  the  P.A.P. of  today  would  have\r\n\r\ncollapsed without the support of the Four-Party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlliance. That is why they are toeing the same line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when the Tunku moved the\r\n\r\nmotion  on  Malaysia in the Federal  Parliament,  he\r\n\r\nstated clearly that there would be no merger without\r\n\r\na  Malaysia comprising the five territories of  this\r\n\r\nregion.  He also said that the citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  treated on a par with those  in  the\r\n\r\nother  territories.  It  is  because  of  this  that\r\n\r\nwithout  the  other territories coming  in  to  form\r\n\r\nMalaysia, there would not be any merger between  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  and  Singapore.  Our   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is very anxious about Malaysia because  of\r\n\r\nthis  remark  made  by  the Prime  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation. The Prime Minister of our State is  just\r\n\r\nlike  an  ant  on a hot pan. He will resort  to  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of  means  to sell out the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  Singapore.  He  will  do  everything  to\r\n\r\nachieve this end. He will do all sorts of tricks  to\r\n\r\ndivert the attention of the people of Singapore from\r\n\r\nthe  truth.  In this way, he hopes to cover  up  his\r\n\r\nsell  out  plan. For example, today  and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nevery   other  day,  they  have  talked  about   the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  They say that Mr Lim  Ching  Siong  is\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by  the  P.K.I. and  so  on.  They  have\r\n\r\ncreated  a  sensation in South-East Asia,  by  their\r\n\r\nremarks about the Communists. We would like to point\r\n\r\nout  to  them  here  that the game  which  they  are\r\n\r\nplaying is not new, and the people of Singapore will\r\n\r\nnot  fall  into their trap.

They  are  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion  that  these  people  here  are  even   more\r\n\r\ninteresting characters than Mr McCarthy himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, desperate people like the\r\n\r\nleaders  of the P.A.P. can only have one  hope,  and\r\n\r\nthis  hope seems to be attached to a plan  like  the\r\n\r\nGreater  Malaysia Plan, which will be a  saviour  to\r\n\r\nthem.  Without the Malaysia Plan, the  life  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will  end very soon. It is because  of  this\r\n\r\nthat  they  hope  that the Malaysia  Plan  will,  if\r\n\r\npossible,  materialise tomorrow. In order to  induce\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore to accept their  Malaysia\r\n\r\nPlan,  the  P.A.P. are saying everywhere  that  once\r\n\r\nMalaysia  materialises, there will be heavy rainfall\r\n\r\nin Singapore to fill up all our reservoirs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand there will not be any water rationing. They will\r\n\r\nalso  make  the  people believe that  Malaysia  will\r\n\r\nbring a lot of gold to Singapore and the people will\r\n\r\nlead a life of paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, our Ministers appear to\r\n\r\nbe  great  magicians  who hold  the  magic  wand  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  with  which  they  think  they  can   give\r\n\r\nwhatever  the  people want. In  the  course  of  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on this motion, the leaders of the Party  in\r\n\r\npower  have become all of a sudden great  heroes  of\r\n\r\nnationalism  and  anti-Communism.  They  bring   the\r\n\r\nbanners  of  nationalists in order to sell  out  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the people of Singapore.  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the true nationalists are  those  who\r\n\r\nstrongly oppose colonialism. But the leaders of  the\r\n\r\nParty in power are afraid to go against colonialism.\r\n\r\nWhenever they hear the term \"anti-colonialism\", they\r\n\r\nare  angry  and vexed. They are prepared  to  accept\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule. They think that this  colonial  rule\r\n\r\ncan  be dispensed with on the golf course. They call\r\n\r\nthemselves nationalists, but they have been  running\r\n\r\naway from the people of Singapore who are struggling\r\n\r\nagainst  colonialism. They are the defeated soldiers\r\n\r\nof nationalism. I should say that they are deserters\r\n\r\nfrom the rank and file of the nationalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when anti-colonial forces are expanding,\r\n\r\nthe position of the colonial rulers is becoming more\r\n\r\nand  more  shaky. The colonialists are  afraid  that\r\n\r\nafter  independence, the peoples will not only  wipe\r\n\r\nout   their  political  influence,  but  also  their\r\n\r\ncontrol   - economically and culturally. The  fear  of\r\n\r\nnationalism  has  led colonialists to  approach  the\r\n\r\npseudo  nationalists whom they can make use of.  The\r\n\r\nMalaysia Plan has come about from the background  of\r\n\r\na  colonial  game, which is played by  the  colonial\r\n\r\nrulers  who  think that they can no longer  continue\r\n\r\ntheir stranglehold of this region. That is why  they\r\n\r\nwant to get agents through whom they can exert their\r\n\r\ncontrol  and maintain their political influence  and\r\n\r\neconomic position in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my colleague, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Havelock, has very clearly said in this  House,\r\n\r\nand in no uncertain terms, that the Malaysia Plan is\r\n\r\na  game played and sponsored by the British. It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  brought  up by the British with the  intention\r\n\r\nthat  through this plan they will be able  to  exert\r\n\r\ncontrol and perpetuate their influence in this area.\r\n\r\nThe  British intend to go out by the front door  and\r\n\r\ncome back by the back door - [Interruption].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Member for Havelock has already exposed you\r\n\r\n(the Prime Minister) for what you are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we feel it is regrettable\r\n\r\nthat  the  British have found their ideal agents  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in the P.A.P. The P.A.P. people  are  the\r\n\r\npseudo  nationalists. The leaders of the P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nbeing  made use of by the British because they  have\r\n\r\ntaken  up policies that are against the nationalists\r\n\r\nand  the people. Their position is now shaky because\r\n\r\nof these policies they have adopted. So, in order to\r\n\r\npreserve their political life, they have joined  the\r\n\r\nanti-Communists  and  work hand  in  hand  with  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaders of the PAP, say that only the Communists\r\n\r\nare  opposed  to the Malaysia Plan. As a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfact,  I  will  tell them that the true nationalists\r\n\r\nand  the  broad  masses are opposed to  the  Greater\r\n\r\nMalaysia Plan arranged by the British.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me give you a clear\r\n\r\nillustration to show that the true nationalists  are\r\n\r\nopposed  to the Malaysia Plan. We all know that  the\r\n\r\nAfro-Asian  Solidarity  Organisation   is   a   true\r\r\n\r\norganisation  of  the Afro-Asian nationalists.  This\r\n\r\nAfro-Asian  Solidarity Organisation has a  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretariat  which recently made  a  declaration  in\r\n\r\nCairo  condemning the British colonialists for their\r\n\r\npart in playing the game of Malaysia in this region.\r\n\r\nThey  also  pointed out that it was the aim  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  to  play the Malaysia game to suppress  the\r\n\r\npeople   in   these  five  territories.   The   true\r\n\r\nnationalists of Afro-Asia are opposed to the British\r\n\r\nplaying the Malaysia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngame.  Only  leaders of the P.A.P. who  are  pseudo\r\n\r\nnationalists will support a plan of this nature.  We\r\n\r\ncan  see  that  the true socialists and nationalists\r\n\r\nhave  already, as reported in today's papers, passed\r\n\r\nsome resolution on the Malaysia Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to give some\r\n\r\nexamples  from the Sin Chew Jit Poh and the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nSiang  Pau  which carried reports of the meeting  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur of socialists from Singapore,  Malaya,\r\n\r\nBrunei,  and Sarawak and the resolutions  that  they\r\n\r\npassed.    These   resolutions   were   passed    by\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   of   Parties   from    the    five\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, today's Sin Chew Jit Poh\r\n\r\ncarries  a  report on the meeting of the  socialists\r\n\r\nconcerning the Malaysia Plan. One resolution  passed\r\n\r\nat this meeting reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This conference regrets that the P.A.P. has\r\n\r\nstaged  a  walkout and issued slanderous  statements\r\n\r\nabout  the  conference. We are convinced that  they,\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. delegates, have come here to dominate the\r\n\r\nconference,  failing which they tried to  wreck  it.\r\n\r\nThey are no more socialists as we believe and so  we\r\n\r\nexpel them.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  resolution was brought up by the Party Ra'ayat\r\n\r\nin the Federation of Malaya and it was passed at the\r\n\r\nConference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another resolution reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This conference condemns the three previous\r\n\r\nConsultative  Solidarity Committee meetings  on  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  proposals on the ground that the delegates\r\n\r\nto these meetings in Sabah, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur\r\n\r\nrepresented   their  ownselves   and   the   British\r\n\r\ninterests.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This resolution was passed at the conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another resolution condemned any move to force\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Malaysia Plan without first  obtaining\r\n\r\nthe consent of the Borneo people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another resolution condemned the three previous\r\n\r\nConsultative  Solidarity Committee meetings  on  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  proposals on the ground that the delegates\r\n\r\nto these meetings in Sabah, Sarawak and Kuala Lumpur\r\n\r\nrepresented   their  ownselves   and   the   British\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from these two resolutions, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we can see clearly that a true socialist Party\r\n\r\nor  a  true nationalist Party will respect  national\r\n\r\nself-determination  and  they  will  also  see  that\r\n\r\ndemocracy  and  equality  are  achieved   in   these\r\n\r\nterritories. We can see clearly that the  P.A.P. of\r\n\r\ntoday has been discarded by the socialist Parties of\r\n\r\nthe five territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, no sound arguments and\r\n\r\nreasons have been advanced by the Ministers  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and  their  colleagues in  support  of  this\r\n\r\nmotion.  Insofar  as  this  country  and  the  three\r\n\r\nterritories  of Borneo are concerned, this  Plan  is\r\n\r\nnot in their interest. We can draw these conclusions\r\n\r\nfrom   the  speeches  of  the  Ministers  and  their\r\n\r\ncolleagues.  First,  after the  realisation  of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan the people of Singapore  and  of  the\r\n\r\nthree territories in Borneo will not enjoy very many\r\n\r\nbenefits.  There will be inequality  and  they  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  bear  the responsibility of  the  expenses\r\n\r\nincurred  by  the  Central Government.  So  this  is\r\n\r\nanother form of colonialism if the Malaysia Plan  is\r\n\r\nto  be  realised on these lines. Second, the British\r\n\r\ncolonialists   will  be  able  to   maintain   their\r\n\r\npolitical and economic interest in this area  for  a\r\n\r\nlong time. Third, the people of this region will  be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in a cold war between the two major  blocs\r\n\r\nin  the  world because of the British bases in  this\r\n\r\nregion.  This  region might even  become  a  battle-front.  Fourth, the P.A.P. leaders think  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to survive after the Malaysia  Plan.\r\n\r\nFifth, after the realisation of Malaysia, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders  will work hand in hand with the  Right-wing\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the Federation and  join  the  anti-Communist organisation sponsored by the British  and\r\n\r\nthe  Americans in South-East Asia. Sixth, this  Plan\r\n\r\nis  meant  to  frustrate the struggle  for  national\r\n\r\nliberation  by  the nationalists and  socialists  in\r\n\r\nthese five territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is why our Chairman\r\n\r\nhas made our stand very clear on this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Barisan  Sosialis seem  to  have  a  very\r\n\r\nstrange  outlook on life. Time and again, they  tell\r\n\r\nus  that they agree with the concept of Malaysia  or\r\n\r\nwith  the  principle of Malaysia and yet  they  have\r\n\r\ntaken  up four days of this Assembly's time  arguing\r\n\r\nagainst the motion moved by the Prime Minister. They\r\n\r\nexplain this obstruction of theirs by claiming  that\r\n\r\nthey  are interested in the details of the  plan  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  in  the  principle. So  are  we,  but  the\r\n\r\nimportant  thing  at this stage is to  realise  what\r\n\r\ncomes first -  and that is agreement with the idea  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at their \"details\", Sir. They seem to\r\n\r\nbe  more  concerned  about  whom  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture lives with and what the Prime Minister  does\r\n\r\nin his spare time - when, where and with whom he plays\r\n\r\ngolf.  These are certainly details - the sort you  get\r\n\r\nin  petty gossip or personal sneering. These are not\r\n\r\nworthy arguments against a proposal to drive out the\r\n\r\nBritish  from their last stronghold in this part  of\r\n\r\nthe   world  and  to  strengthen  the  whole  region\r\n\r\neconomically  and  politically  in  the  nationalist\r\n\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now look at the principles involved in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   Whereas  it  is  a  means  of  obtaining\r\n\r\nindependence for the people of Borneo,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  claim  that it is extending  the  colonial\r\n\r\nrule. The plain fact is that this is a way of making\r\n\r\nthe British go out of Malaya. They claim that it  is\r\n\r\nnot  freedom  to exchange the British flag  for  the\r\n\r\nFederation  one, but it is not so.  Apart  from  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  this  is not very complimentary  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation, it is an exchange of a colonial flag for\r\n\r\na  nationalist one. In this way, freedom comes  much\r\n\r\nquicker  to the Borneo people who can share  in  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional development of the Federation and  in\r\n\r\nall  its  political advances so much ahead of  their\r\n\r\nown present position. We are expected to believe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   in  Malaysia  the  British  will  remain   in\r\n\r\ndisguise.  I  would  like  to  know  what  kind   of\r\n\r\ndisguise. All the other members of Malaysia will  be\r\n\r\npeople  of  the  same race, language  and  political\r\n\r\ndesires  as  themselves. The  Barisan  Sosialis,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  also talk a lot about the need to give  the\r\n\r\nBorneo   people  self-determination,  as  if   after\r\n\r\nMalaysia  they  will have no part  to  play  in  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic government of the whole territory. Let us\r\n\r\nbe quite clear - principles should be simple. Malaysia\r\n\r\nwill  mean  the  end of colonialism and  the  Borneo\r\n\r\npeople  will  join a country which  has  proved  its\r\n\r\nnationalism and made it succeed. They can board  the\r\n\r\nbus to independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another principle involved is the greater economic\r\n\r\nstrength of the Malaysia unit. The reality  of  this\r\n\r\nis  there  for everyone to see in the history  books\r\n\r\nand,  most  of  all, in the map. And  on  that  map,\r\n\r\nSingapore is seen to benefit most of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I conclude by saying that all this talk of details\r\n\r\nis  like  a  clear-cut case before the courts  where\r\n\r\nthere  is no doubt as to a man's innocence but where\r\n\r\nhe  is  convicted  on  a technicality.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are  trying  to destroy  to  principle  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  - that is, the cause of Malaysia - by a number\r\n\r\nof technicalities meant to confuse the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has said that 1962 will be\r\n\r\na  memorable year. But let us not forget that it  is\r\n\r\nthe  Year  of  the Tiger - the year the Malayan  Tiger\r\n\r\nextends     its     victory    over     colonialism.\r\n\r\n[Interruption].  No doubt one day it  will  eat  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. In South-East Asia, the tiger  is\r\n\r\nthe  King of our tropical forests and rules over all\r\n\r\nhis  enemies. The Malayan tiger already rules  alone\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation,  but the  same  forests  extend\r\n\r\nthrough Borneo and Singapore. So let the nationalist\r\n\r\nrule be extended. There is the only way - Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

We have  pointed\r\n\r\nout how the Barisan Sosialis line in this matter  is\r\n\r\nidentical  with  that  of the  P.K.I.  The  original\r\n\r\nconcept  of  Malaysia as proposed by the  Communists\r\n\r\nmeant  the absorption of Singapore into the Republic\r\n\r\nof  Indonesia.  The Member for Thomson  has  clearly\r\n\r\nstated  his  approval  of this scheme.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  members have refuted and denied that  they\r\n\r\nare Communists or stooges of the Communists. How did\r\n\r\nthey  try  to talk themselves out of this? My  view,\r\n\r\nSir,  is that they did so in the most infantile  and\r\n\r\nineffective manner. Many of the speakers,  including\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Upper Serangoon and the Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson,  are  duped in this way. If the  Communists\r\n\r\noppose  the  present  Malaysia Plan  and  they  also\r\n\r\noppose  Malaysia, this does not prove that they  are\r\n\r\nCommunists. If the Communists see certain things  to\r\n\r\nbe  true  and they also come to the same conclusion,\r\n\r\nthis  does  not make them Communists.  No  one  will\r\n\r\ndispute this obvious proposition. However, there  is\r\n\r\nnothing original to this line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago the open front Communist leader,\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  Ching Siong, said that Communist eat  rice\r\n\r\nand  he  eats  rice. But this does not  make  him  a\r\n\r\nCommunist. This way of arguing to disprove  a  well-known fact is quite childish. One might as well  say\r\n\r\nthat  since Mr Kennedy walks on two legs,  and  Mr\r\n\r\nKhrushchev  also walks on two legs,  therefore,  Mr\r\n\r\nKhrushchev  is  an  American.  This  kind  of  logic\r\n\r\nbetrays  the low mentality of the Barisan  Sosialis.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  P.A.P. say that they are  Communists  or\r\n\r\nstooges of the Communists, we have produced concrete\r\n\r\nevidence and have challenged\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem to refute this evidence. They have not dared so\r\n\r\nfar  to deny the evidence that we have produced. Let\r\n\r\nme  remind the House of what we have said about  the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson. May I quote from a broadcast  of\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister? It is in page 75 of the booklet,\r\n\r\n\"The Battle for Merger\", third paragraph, taken from\r\n\r\nthe 10th broadcast of the Prime Minister. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Communists have a wide range of persuasion\r\n\r\nand  pressure  techniques for  the  manipulation  of\r\n\r\nhuman  beings.  They  won over  S.  T.  Bani  partly\r\n\r\nbecause their zeal and ceaseless work in the  unions\r\n\r\nconvinced  him  that  he  did  not  have  a   chance\r\n\r\ncompeting against them, partly by the argument  that\r\n\r\nthe world is being slowly absorbed and converted  to\r\n\r\nCommunism,  and finally by the constant pressure  of\r\n\r\npersuasion and argument wearing down his nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to see me in hospital in July last year.\r\n\r\nHe  said  we  had  made a great  mistake  in  taking\r\n\r\noffice, and that we should get out of office as soon\r\n\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time there were acute conflicts in the\r\n\r\nT.U.C.  Secretariat  between  Lim  and  Fong's  pro-Communist  faction, and Kandasamy and  Devan  Nair's\r\n\r\nnon-Communist faction, Bani was then on the side  of\r\n\r\nKandasamy and Devan Nair who was his closest friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devan and Bani were such close friends that only\r\n\r\nlast  year  they  rented adjoining  houses.  But  by\r\n\r\nOctober   last   year  we  slowly  discovered   that\r\n\r\nsomething had happened to him. He had gone  over  to\r\n\r\nthe  Communist side. Now he is not on speaking terms\r\n\r\nwith Devan Nair although he still lives next door.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Prime Minister said is the truth and will\r\n\r\nstand as the truth. If the Member for Thomson thinks\r\n\r\nit  is a false allegation, it is a simple matter for\r\n\r\nhim to bring a charge against the Prime Minister for\r\n\r\ndefamation  of  character. He will  then  have  full\r\n\r\nopportunity  in  a court of law to  have  the  truth\r\n\r\nestablished. If the Prime Minister cannot prove  his\r\n\r\ncase,   the  Member  for  Thomson  will  be  awarded\r\n\r\nhandsome  damages. But like all the other Communists\r\n\r\nmentioned in \"The Battle for Merger\", they know that\r\n\r\nwhat  is said about them is the truth and they  know\r\n\r\nthat  if  it is brought to court the truth  will  be\r\n\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me also remind the House what the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister said about the Member for Queenstown during\r\n\r\nthe debate on the motion of confidence on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  20th  July last year. I am going through  these\r\n\r\ndetails  to show beyond all doubt that when  we  say\r\n\r\nthat   they  are  Communists  or  stooges   of   the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  we have full and irrefutable  proof  of\r\n\r\nour statements. Sir, I am quoting from Hansard, Vol.\r\n\r\n14,  No.  23,  col. 1729. This is what  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... the Parliamentary Secretary [i.e. the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown] declared that the salvation of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. lies  in  full  ... co-operation  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists. Sir, I am not mincing my words here ...\r\n\r\nIn our discussions that we had, we did not use vague\r\n\r\nterms   such   as   \"extreme   left\"   or   \"Leftist\r\n\r\nsocialists\".  We were talking about  the  Communists\r\n\r\nand both he and I understood what we meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I posed to him the question whether he had\r\n\r\nunderstood  the risk involved in such  a  course  of\r\n\r\naction.  I said to him, \"If you are a Communist  and\r\n\r\nact  as one, you have no cause to regret should  any\r\n\r\nill  consequences  befall you.  You  understand  the\r\n\r\nideology;  you are dedicated to the cause,  and  you\r\n\r\nare  prepared for the sacrifices. But if you are not\r\n\r\na Communist and try to toe their line, then you have\r\n\r\nonly  yourself  to blame if events  overwhelm  you.\"\r\n\r\nNow,   Sir,  the  [Member  for  Queenstown]  is   no\r\n\r\nCommunist.  He  does  not even understand  the  most\r\n\r\nelementary tenets of Marxism-Leninism.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister is quoting, he\r\n\r\nmust  quote the exact words in the Official  Report.\r\n\r\nThe   words   are,  \"Now,  Sir,  the   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  is no Communist.\" Of course, we  do  know\r\n\r\nthat \"the Parliamentary Secretary\" means \"the Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown\" in this context. But what I wish  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  is  that if there is a  quotation,  that\r\n\r\nquotation must be quoted. Otherwise, of course,  the\r\n\r\nMinister can paraphrase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Sir, can I substitute the words\r\n\r\n\"the  Member  for Queenstown\" for \"the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary is no\r\n\r\nCommunist.

The Minister, of course, could\r\n\r\nstop there and say, \"The Parliamentary Secretary  is\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown\". The point I am trying to\r\n\r\nmake   is   that  words  in  a  quotation  must   be\r\n\r\nmentioned. That is all there is to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now, Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary [in this\r\n\r\ncase, the Member for Queenstown] is no Communist. He\r\n\r\ndoes  not even understand the most elementary tenets\r\n\r\nof  Marxism-Leninism. Indeed, a great  deal  of  his\r\n\r\nbehaviour  and  activity rather suggest  to  me  the\r\n\r\nconduct of a foolish virgin who has entered  into  a\r\n\r\nbrothel area and proclaimed the brotherhood of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he want to embark on this hazardous\r\n\r\ncourse?  He wants mass popularity for the Party  and\r\n\r\nfor  himself which he thinks only the Communists can\r\n\r\nprovide.  I repeatedly asked him whether or  not  he\r\n\r\nhad calculated the consequences... Sir, I have spent\r\n\r\na  long  time  with the Parliamentary  Secretary  to\r\n\r\nconvince him of the error of his assumption.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I am quoting from column 1730, second paragraph, 5th\r\n\r\nline:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But I could not move him from that position ...\r\n\r\nthe British ... had convinced the Communists that it\r\n\r\nis  safe for them to proceed, and the Communists  in\r\n\r\nturn have convinced the Parliamentary Secretary that\r\n\r\nno ill consequences would follow his throwing in his\r\n\r\nlot  with  them. On the contrary, he would  get  the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  mass popularity and  the  support  of\r\n\r\ntheir  mass organisations in Singapore. And  in  the\r\n\r\nend,  Sir, a delectable prize to win - the Premiership\r\n\r\nof Singapore!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  why  the  Member for  Queens-town  is  co-operating  with  the Communists and  is  willing  to\r\n\r\nserve as their stooge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the Member for Upper Serangoon. He\r\n\r\nhas  spoken a great deal about the logic  of  saying\r\n\r\nthat   Mr  Khrushchev  is  an  American  just  like\r\n\r\nPresident  Kennedy - he walks on two  legs.  Our  case\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Member  for  Upper  Serangoon  is  not\r\n\r\nwhether  he  walks on two legs or on four  legs,  or\r\n\r\ncrawls on his belly or whether he eats rice or sweet\r\n\r\npotatoes.  Our case against him is that  during  his\r\n\r\nschooldays  he had already enrolled as a  member  of\r\n\r\nthe  Anti-British League. Everybody knows  that  the\r\n\r\nAnti-British  League  is  the  cadet  corps  of  the\r\n\r\n[Malayan  Communist Party. It is in the Anti-British\r\n\r\nLeague that young men and women are trained and  put\r\n\r\nthrough  their  paces in all kinds  of  illegal  and\r\n\r\nconspiratorial  work.  The proper  A.B.L. graduated\r\n\r\ninto full membership of the Malayan Communist Party.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for  Upper Serangoon joined  the  Anti-British League when he was in school,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  did  the  Member for Havelock. The  Anti-British\r\n\r\nLeague  is organised on the same cell system as  the\r\n\r\nparent  Malayan Communist Party. Each cell is guided\r\n\r\nby  a leader. Now and then membership and leadership\r\n\r\nof cells changed. The Member for Upper Serangoon was\r\n\r\nunder  the guidance of several leaders who had  been\r\n\r\nunderground  operators  for  the  Malayan  Communist\r\n\r\nParty for a long time. One of these men was arrested\r\n\r\nsome  years  ago  and  banished to  China.  Recently\r\n\r\nanother  underground Communist with whom the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Upper  Serangoon had close association  emerged\r\n\r\nfrom  the underground and made contact with him.  It\r\n\r\nwas  this man who finally persuaded him to join  the\r\n\r\nothers  in attacking the P.A.P. Thus the Member  for\r\n\r\nUpper Serangoon has renewed his association with the\r\n\r\nunderground  organisation of the  Malayan  Communist\r\n\r\nParty.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I know  that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nserious  charge  to make. If the  Member  for  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon  cares  to  deny it, we  are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nproduce  evidence  in  support  of  not  only   this\r\n\r\nallegation but also disclose further and more  lurid\r\n\r\ndetails   of   his  association  with  the   Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, Mr Lim Ching Siong tries to\r\n\r\nlaugh away this business by saying that other people\r\n\r\nhave  accused him of being a Communist. The  trouble\r\n\r\nis  that  other  people have  never  worked  in  co-operation  with the Communists in the  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nstruggle.  But we of the P.A.P. did so  for  several\r\n\r\nyears.  We,  therefore, know  what  we  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout. We know how they operate and we know who  the\r\n\r\nguilty  men are. We have named them, and  they  have\r\n\r\nnot  dared to deny the particular evidence  we  have\r\n\r\nproduced.  The reason why the Communists  and  their\r\n\r\nstooges  in the Barisan Sosialis oppose Malaysia  is\r\n\r\nvery  simple.  They  know  that  after  merger   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  they  will  stand  in  great  danger  from\r\n\r\nsecurity  action taken by the Central Government  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation. The Federation Government fought the\r\n\r\nCommunists  not only in their subversive  activities\r\n\r\nbut   also   in  a  prolonged  shooting   war.   The\r\n\r\nCommunists, therefore fear the elected government of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya.  It  is  not  for us in the  P.A.P. to  say\r\n\r\nwhether or not these fears are justified. This is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  solely  for them to judge. I would  suggest,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that  they  have  already  come   to   the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  a great store of  misfortune  lies\r\n\r\nahead  of both the Communists, their stooges in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, and their operators in  the  open\r\n\r\nfront  trade  unions  and other organisations  after\r\n\r\nmerger  or  Malaysia. Hence, their mounting  frantic\r\n\r\neffort  to stop Malaysia. But they will fail  to  do\r\n\r\nthis.  Both  Malaysia  and merger  are  historically\r\n\r\ninevitable  and the Communists themselves  know  it.\r\n\r\nMost  of their stooges who are less intelligent than\r\n\r\nthe  Communists are slowly beginning to realise  the\r\n\r\nawful  truth.  That is why they are trying  to  deny\r\n\r\nthat  they  have anything to do with the Communists.\r\n\r\nBut  as the ancient saying goes, \"Truth is great and\r\n\r\nit shall prevail.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, you will remember that\r\n\r\nduring the course of the debate on this motion  last\r\n\r\nweek,  the  red  caps of the Communists  were  flung\r\n\r\nabout in this House. You will also remember how  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of the P.A.P. called all those who  opposed\r\n\r\nthis  motion as Communists or stooges controlled  by\r\n\r\nthe  Communists. Mr Speaker. Sir,  these  rash  and\r\n\r\nderogatory  accusations by the P.A.P. leaders  will\r\n\r\nnot  frighten  the broad masses into changing  their\r\n\r\nstand and attitude towards the Malaysia Plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. leaders' desperate\r\n\r\nand  malicious shouts of madness have  already  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  effect.  Starting from today the  P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nhaving  their  so-called Malaysia Week during  which\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government will invite a colonial officer\r\n\r\nof Sarawak, namely, Mr Morrison of the Intelligence\r\n\r\nDepartment,   to   give  a  broadcast   over   Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The P.A.P. Government have also  ordered\r\n\r\nthat  all  ships  anchored  within  the  waters   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  be decorated  in  celebration  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Week.  Again  the P.A.P.  Government  have\r\n\r\nasked Mr Alex Josey, who was the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDirector  in charge of Psychological Warfare  during\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency in the Federation, to write all sorts\r\n\r\nof  articles. In spite of all these moves  taken  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government, I believe  the  peoples  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  Federation of Malaya.  Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nBrunei can see one secret. The P.A.P. leadership  is\r\n\r\ntrying to play with the Malaysia Plan only with this\r\n\r\naim.  That  is, the P.A.P. hopes to go through  with\r\n\r\nthis  plan  in order to salvage its dying  political\r\n\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what are the views of the\r\n\r\npeoples  in the five territories of Brunei, Sarawak,\r\n\r\nNorth  Borneo,  Singapore  and  the  Federation   on\r\n\r\nMalaysia? Here I would like to acquaint you with one\r\n\r\nfact.   At  the  Kuala  Lumpur  Conference  of   the\r\n\r\nMalaysian    Socialists    yesterday,    all     the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  Brunei and  Sarawak  strongly\r\n\r\nopposed the Malaysia Plan. Even the Party Rakyat and\r\n\r\nthe   Labour  Party  of  the  Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\ndisagreed  with  the  stand of the  P.A.P. on  this\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to disclose to you\r\n\r\nsome more facts. The majority of the representatives\r\n\r\nat  this  Malaysian Socialist Conference are Malays.\r\n\r\nThis  conference was conducted by a  Malay.  It  was\r\n\r\nunder  such  circumstances that the  P.A.P.'s  views\r\n\r\nwere   rejected   by  the  conference.   After   the\r\n\r\nrejection,  the  P.A.P. delegation,  headed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture, walked out of the conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the anti-Communist heroes\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. left the conference, the Minister for\r\n\r\nCulture   abused  the  Communists.   He   made   the\r\n\r\nallegation  that  this  was  a  conference  of   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  and  that  it  was  controlled  by   the\r\n\r\nCommunists. Mr Speaker, by uttering such  rash  and\r\n\r\ndiscourteous words the Minister for Culture and  his\r\n\r\nassociates had not only insulted the representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  the five territories at the meeting, but  also\r\n\r\ninsulted the people of all the five territories.  By\r\n\r\nthis behaviour, they have discredited the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the  eyes  of the  five  territories.\r\n\r\nCommunist this, Communist that! The red hats of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  flown  from  Singapore to  Kuala  Lumpur.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, why should the Minister for Culture be\r\n\r\nso  anxious  and  excited? It is simply  because  he\r\n\r\nknows   that  the  true  socialists  of   the   five\r\n\r\nterritories   do  not  welcome  the  Malaysia   Plan\r\n\r\nsponsored  by the Right-wing elements in conjunction\r\n\r\nwith  the  British colonialists who were behind  the\r\n\r\nscenes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the history of Malaya tells us\r\n\r\nthat when a Party and its politicians are confronted\r\n\r\nwith  the prospect of being in their last days, they\r\n\r\nwill  resort to the last weapon. That is, they  will\r\n\r\nplay  with  communalism as their political  tactics,\r\n\r\nand  in  the meantime they will shout anti-Communist\r\n\r\nslogans.  But history also tells us that  all  those\r\n\r\nwho played with communal politics and shouting anti-communist slogans met with a very bad end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture is today just following the footsteps of the Member for Cairnhill in shouting anti-communist slogans. From his behaviour, we can see that even the Member for Cairnhill has to look up to him as an elder person in regard to the shouting of anti-Communist slogans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. delegation was\r\n\r\nexposed in their attempts to wreck the conference of\r\n\r\nthe  Socialists in Kuala Lumpur. They have been held\r\n\r\nup  as  a Party which is not socialist. It has  also\r\n\r\nnow  been shown that the P.A.P. leadership are anti-Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Malaysia Plan, I entirely\r\n\r\nsupport  the  arguments advanced by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  who  is the Chairman  of  our  Party.  1\r\n\r\ntherefore  appeal to the leaders of  the  P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nforget   about  their  mad  shouting  and  malicious\r\n\r\nabuses,  and instead listen calmly to the voices  of\r\n\r\nthe peoples in the five territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Law (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in the debate on merger, we\r\n\r\nknew that the Barisan Sosialis were afraid to debate\r\n\r\nor  to  take part in the voting. This was made clear\r\n\r\nwhen  the  division was called. The Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nrevealed their fear by leaving the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChamber  and  not  taking part in  the  voting.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, on the merger motion too, the agents of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis took active measures to  meet  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  coffee-shops and agitating  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nsection  by frightening methods that if merger  were\r\n\r\nrealised, the Malays would overwhelm the Chinese. In\r\n\r\naddition, the pro-Communist elements of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have, by the use of their agents in Malaya,\r\n\r\ntried  to  frighten the Malays that if  merger  were\r\n\r\nrealised,  it  would mean that the Malays  would  be\r\n\r\noverwhelmed by the Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to the Malaysia motion. The Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are  very  afraid  of  merger.  The   pro-Communists  are  even more afraid of Malaysia.  Just\r\n\r\nnow  the Member for Serangoon Gardens said that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. always accused the Barisan Sosialis of  being\r\n\r\npro-Communists. This, he said, would not  frightened\r\n\r\naway  the  people. It is true that the people  would\r\n\r\nnot be afraid. But the people who are afraid are the\r\n\r\npro-Communist Members of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, several Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen have quoted reports in connection with the Malaysian Socialist Conference held in Malaya. I also wish to quote an excerpt from page 1 of the Berita Harian of today's issue. It says that this Conference condemned the P.A.P. delegates led by Mr Devan Nair; the leader of the P.A.P. delegation walked out\r\n\r\nof the conference and the conference considered that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  delegates  attempted  to  manipulate  the\r\n\r\nconference.  After the resolution was  adopted,  the\r\n\r\nChairman, Mr Ishak, said, \"The P.A.P. are no longer\r\n\r\nsocialists and with this they are expelled and  they\r\n\r\nare hereby expelled.\" Mr Speaker, we know that this\r\n\r\nconference was not a truly socialist conference.  It\r\n\r\nwas  merely  a camouflage and was organised  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  If,  according  to  the  Chairman,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. had been expelled, this does not surprise  us\r\n\r\nbecause   we   are   a   genuine  socialist   party.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  Mr  Speaker, in  the  same  issue  of\r\n\r\nBerita Harian, there is a report mentioning a speech\r\n\r\nmade  by  Mr Lim Ching Siong, the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis, who spoke in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMandarin  and  Malay.  In his speech  in  Malay,  he\r\n\r\ndenied  that  he was a Communist. Mr Speaker,  this\r\n\r\nhas  been  proved by the Prime Minister in his  book\r\n\r\nThe  Battle for Merger. He has said that if Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong  has  got  the  guts  to  refute   this\r\n\r\nallegation, he should take court action against  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister. And Mr Lim Ching Siong also denied\r\n\r\nthat  the Barisan Sosialis received inspiration from\r\n\r\nthe  Communist Party in Indonesia. \"It is not we who\r\n\r\nare toeing the line of the P.K.I. but the reverse is\r\n\r\nthe  case,\" Mr Lim Ching Siong said amidst applause\r\n\r\nand  clapping  of hands. Mr Speaker,  I  personally\r\n\r\nknow Mr Lim Ching Siong. He has denied that he is a\r\n\r\nfollower  of  the  P.K.I. and  that  the  P.K.I. is\r\n\r\nfollowing his line. This goes to prove, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat two times five are 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis are genuinely afraid of the realisation of Malaysia or merger because they fear that out of this will emerge second-class citizenship and the question of internal security. Yes, Mr Speaker, internal security laws will be applied to real pro-Communist elements or Communists. But a real socialist fighter\r\n\r\nneed  not  be afraid of the internal security  laws.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker. I personally underwent the  experience\r\n\r\nof  having been persecuted by the internal  security\r\n\r\nlaws,   but  because  I  have  complete   faith   in\r\n\r\nsocialism, I met such persecutions bravely. Only pro-Communists  or  real Communists are  afraid  of  the\r\n\r\ninternal security laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens said the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Socialist conference in Malaya was  guided\r\n\r\nby a Malay. I know a number of Malays present at the\r\n\r\nconference.  I  know  from my colleagues  that  only\r\n\r\nthree  Malays  attended the conference.  This  means\r\n\r\nthat in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, pro-Communist  elements or Communists do  not  have  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the Malays. I hope that all the  Malays\r\n\r\nand other communities will be on their guard against\r\n\r\nCommunist  subversive elements who are  infiltrating\r\n\r\nassociations  and villages in order to frustrate  or\r\n\r\nwreck merger and Malaysia and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon and Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Wee Toon Boon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon</b> remained silent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Wee Toon Boon, not speaking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No. I have called the Member.

They say they are fervent\r\n\r\nanti-colonialists,  but  when  we  the  P.A.P. are\r\n\r\nfervently trying to liberate the people not only  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  but also in the three Borneo  territories\r\n\r\nfrom the clutches of British colonialism, they,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan, strongly oppose our attempt. They find  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of methods to frustrate this movement. We  in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. try to rally the forces and the strength\r\n\r\nof  the people in these three territories so  as  to\r\n\r\nliberate them who are still in the clutches  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish  colonial  master,  but  they,  instead   of\r\n\r\norganising the people and rallying them together  to\r\n\r\nthrow  off the colonial yoke, collaborate  with  the\r\n\r\nBritish  High Commissioner to frustrate our  attempt\r\n\r\nto bring the people into a united Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you will have observed, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nduring  the  debate on the motion last month,  which\r\n\r\nembodied  the  proposed  terms  of  merger   between\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  the  Federation,  they   vehemently\r\n\r\ncondemned it. Now, when we are discussing the motion\r\n\r\nto  bring  freedom to the people of Sarawak,  Borneo\r\n\r\nand  Brunei,  they too again oppose it. They  always\r\n\r\ncondemn  and  slander  us  as  pro-colonialists  and\r\n\r\nRightists.  Now,  let  us see what  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown had to say of the P.A.P. when he was with\r\n\r\nus.  You  remember, Sir, the Member for  Queenstown,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Mountbatten and the Member  for  Ulu\r\n\r\nPandan  represented the Singapore C.P.A.  Branch  to\r\n\r\nthe conference held in Kuching\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  August  1960.

I have already indicated that\r\n\r\nthat  report is confidential to the C.P.A.  It  must\r\n\r\nnot be referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Sir, I bow to your ruling. But\r\n\r\nmy  point  is  this. What I am trying to  do  is  to\r\n\r\nrefute  the allegations that are now hurled  against\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. When they were with us and even as  late\r\n\r\nas  in  the Hong Lim by-election, they stood on  our\r\n\r\nplatform  and  told  the  public  that  we   are   a\r\n\r\nprogressive government and that we are the  vanguard\r\n\r\nof  the  anti-colonial forces. We are, in fact,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that brought freedom and benefits to  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in  Singapore. But now, Mr Speaker,  after\r\n\r\nthe  split  and  in  a matter of months,  they  have\r\n\r\nforgotten what they told the public about the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThey are trying to hurl abuse at us, saying that  we\r\n\r\nare  no more anti-colonial forces, that we are  pro-colonialists and Rightists. As I have said just now,\r\n\r\nI   am  at  a  loss  to  understand  the  logic  and\r\n\r\nphilosophy of the Barisan Sosialis. When we  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are  trying to organise the people  and  the\r\n\r\nnationalist  leaders in Malaya,  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nthree Borneo territories to remove the British Union\r\n\r\nJack  and to hoist our own national emblem, they  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  join us. They still want the  British\r\n\r\nUnion  Jack  to  be hoisted on to the  flagposts  of\r\n\r\nthese three territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are discussing a\r\n\r\nmotion  which  will give freedom  not  only  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  but also  to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSarawak, North Borneo and Brunei. On one occasion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen   we  debated  the  motion  on  merger  between\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  the  Federation,   we   heard   the\r\n\r\nconvincing  story  of  what transpired  between  the\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the Barisan Sosialis and Lord  Selkirk.\r\n\r\nBut  in  this  instance, when we  are  debating  the\r\n\r\nmotion  on  Malaysia,  we have  again  observed  the\r\n\r\nbetrayal  of the people by the Barisan Sosialis  who\r\n\r\nconnived   with   an  outside  body - the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nCommunist Party. In these two debates, we have heard\r\n\r\nthem accusing the PAP. Government of suppressing the\r\n\r\nfreedom  of the people by the use of the police  and\r\n\r\nmilitary forces against the people. But what have we\r\n\r\nseen  at  the conference in Kuala Lumpur?  When  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. asked  that they be allowed to submit  their\r\n\r\nworking paper on their stand on the reunification of\r\n\r\nall  the people in Malaysia, the socialists rejected\r\n\r\nit.  They discussed instead something else which was\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the  interest of the people  in  these\r\n\r\nterritories. The Barisan Sosialis always say that we\r\n\r\nare  not  interested in the welfare of the  workers,\r\n\r\nbut  that  is  not  trite. We have  time  and  again\r\n\r\nexplained  to  this  House  that  the  resources  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are limited. In order to bring benefits to\r\n\r\nthe  people, we must, first of all, wrest  political\r\n\r\npower from the British colonial masters, and then we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to shape an economy which will  bring\r\n\r\ncomfort  and benefit to our working class. This  has\r\n\r\nalways  been  our objective, but we only  meet  with\r\n\r\nobstruction from the Barisan Sosialis leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the allegation that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have suppressed the workers, I will have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  no  doubt of replying  to  it  When  we\r\n\r\ndebate  the next motion. But. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nare trying to bring something good for the people in\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  and therefore, we will fight against  any\r\n\r\npeople  who try to frustrate our plan. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Barisan  Sosialis  oppose  Malaysia   not\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  bad  for the 10 million  people  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia but because it is bad for the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> It is good for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we say that\r\n\r\nwe  believe in parliamentary democracy. We  have  to\r\n\r\nface the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  after our term of office. Sir,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have accused us of betraying the people  by\r\n\r\nachieving  merger. They say that  we  are  still  in\r\n\r\noffice  for the good of ourselves and that  we  have\r\n\r\ndeviated  from our anti-colonial stand. So according\r\n\r\nto  the  logic  of  the Barisan Sosialis,  if  these\r\n\r\naccusations  are true, then we should fight  against\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and merger. We will work for the  good  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  and we know what they want  us  to  do.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we have to be firm in our stand in  spite\r\n\r\nof  the  smear  that  we  are  pro-colonialists  and\r\n\r\nRightists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Fascists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> With regard to the allegation\r\n\r\nthat we are Fascists, it is very simple to rebut it.\r\n\r\nAs I said just now, I could not make my speech as  I\r\n\r\nforgot  to bring some newspapers. We can quote  many\r\n\r\ninstances. What happened at the conference in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur?   We  believe  in  the  achievement   of   a\r\n\r\ndemocratic Malaya; we must have the courage to stand\r\n\r\nup and fight against those who try to frustrate this\r\n\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also been accused by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  that we deny them the freedom  of  speech,\r\n\r\nassembly,  and so on. These Members of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  who defected from our Party know the  laws\r\n\r\nof the country but they make no attempt to apply for\r\n\r\na  permit  to paste posters or to hold rallies.  So,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, where is the truth  that  we  are\r\n\r\nFascists and that we are suppressing freedom?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are accused of betraying the\r\n\r\npeople. The truth is that we are not prepared to  be\r\n\r\nmanipulated by the Communist front organisations  or\r\n\r\nby  the  Communists themselves. They left our  Party\r\n\r\nand they now have no protection from us. That is why\r\n\r\nthey   are   scared  that  they  will   suffer   the\r\n\r\nconsequences  of  their foolishness.  That  is  why,\r\n\r\nafter realising what they have done, they want us to\r\n\r\ngive them the necessary protection. But the point is\r\n\r\nthis: we are going to fight for the interest of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  Malaya,  and,  therefore,  we  are   not\r\n\r\ninterested in the safety or in the welfare of a  few\r\n\r\npeople. These people have been warned that if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey want to carry on in the same way, it would  not\r\n\r\nonly  bring disaster to them but also to the  people\r\n\r\nin  Malaya. That is our duty and we will continue to\r\n\r\nlook after the interest of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I had not intended to speak on this subject but\r\n\r\nthe  illogical arguments advanced by the Member  for\r\n\r\nfor Havelock make it necessary for me to speak on  a\r\n\r\nfew points. I feel that on such an important subject\r\n\r\nlike  this,  which involves the lives of 10  million\r\n\r\npeople,  we  should  not  take  the  opportunity  of\r\n\r\nplaying politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last four days, I expected the\r\n\r\nGovernment to mention the concrete benefits that the\r\n\r\nman   in   the  street  will  get  if  Malaysia   is\r\n\r\nimplemented and the disaster that will take place if\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  not implemented. I also  expected  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis to put forward their views  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat  disaster will befall the man in the street  if\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  implemented - with both of  them  giving\r\n\r\nexamples  in support of their arguments. Instead  of\r\n\r\nwhich  we heard that travel would be made easier - how\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  ordinary  people  travel,  Sir?   - and\r\n\r\nsweeping statements like, \"There are potentialities.\r\n\r\nCultural and economic ties demand that we should  be\r\n\r\ntogether.\"  Such  things do not affect  the  average\r\n\r\nman.  But what I noticed was that mud and dirt  have\r\n\r\nbeen flung around this Chamber; so I made up my mind\r\n\r\nnot   to   speak.  But  as  I  said,  the  illogical\r\n\r\nstatements  made  by the member  for  Havelock  have\r\n\r\nstirred me into making these points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock said that because Lord\r\n\r\nSelkirk  was  afraid that Indonesia would  turn  its\r\n\r\nattention to Borneo after West Irian, we must oppose\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I do not see any logic in that statement,\r\n\r\nSir. Why must we cut our nose to spite our face?  If\r\n\r\nwe   are  going  to  have  more  potentialities  and\r\n\r\nprosperity,  are  we going to oppose  Malaysia  just\r\n\r\nbecause  Lord  Selkirk  is  interested?  He  may  be\r\n\r\ninterested in his own way. But whether we accept  it\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  depends on whether the Government can prove  to\r\n\r\nus  if it is going to be for the good of the people.\r\n\r\nWe  are  not  concerned with how Lord Selkirk  feels\r\n\r\nabout  it,  Sir,I do not see how that argument  can\r\n\r\nhold water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am speaking, I might as well touch on the\r\n\r\npoints  raised by the other Members which I consider\r\n\r\nto be illogical. The two questions of West Irian and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  are  quite  different.  That  is  why  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  opposed  one  but  supported  the\r\n\r\nother,  because the argument given was that  only  a\r\n\r\nfew  hundred Papuans in West Irian are involved  and\r\n\r\nthat  10 million people are involved in Malaysia.  I\r\n\r\ncannot  see  the logic that because  a  few  hundred\r\n\r\npeople are involved we must not allow colonialism to\r\n\r\ncontinue,  and  that because 10 million  people  are\r\n\r\ninvolved  colonialism can continue. I  cannot  quite\r\n\r\nfollow that logic, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that the Malaysia Plan is a\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper proposal. I think the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nare giving the P.A.P. more credit than they deserve.\r\n\r\nI  do not think they are all that powerful. I do not\r\n\r\nthink  that all the people of the Borneo territories\r\n\r\nand  Malaya  are going to listen and adopt  a  White\r\n\r\nPaper  of  the P.A.P. I do not think they  have  the\r\n\r\nauthority  to do it in the first place. The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are giving them far too much credit.  They\r\n\r\nwent  on to say that because they rejected the White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger proposals, they must also reject  this\r\n\r\nmotion  on  Malaysia.  I do not  understand  how  it\r\n\r\nfollows because the White Paper are details  on  our\r\n\r\nmerger.  They  have said that they are in  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  the  principle  and  concept  of  merger   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia. But the White Paper are details which they\r\n\r\ndo not agree with. They have every right to disagree\r\n\r\nwith it. But it does not follow that because they do\r\n\r\nnot  agree  with  the  details of  our  merger,  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of Malaysia -  which they admit they  are  in\r\n\r\nagreement with - must also be rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point they raised was that this Malaysia\r\n\r\nPlan  should  be  motivated by a sincere  desire  to\r\n\r\npromote  benefit for the people in the  territories.\r\n\r\nThey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  said  that the Plan is a project of  the  pro-Western politicians and that the real attraction was\r\n\r\nthe oilfields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that it was the leader of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis  - I stand to be  corrected - who\r\n\r\nsang  the praises of Tunku Abdul Rahman as being  an\r\n\r\nhonest  and  a frank person who never  told  a  lie.\r\n\r\nThese  words were uttered by one of the  Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis - I do not know  which  one  of\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I stand corrected,\r\n\r\nbut  I  think the words \"colonial stooge\" were  used\r\n\r\nabout the promoters, of whom Tunku Abdul Rahman  was\r\n\r\none whom they have sung praises of. Then there was a\r\n\r\nnasty insinuation  - that probably the real aim was to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  oilfields. Sir, if a man  is  sincere,\r\n\r\nfrank,  and honest, I do not think he will do  that.\r\n\r\nThose two do not tally.

Sir, may I ask, what are the right things? I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the right things must be peace, prosperity,\r\n\r\nadvancement, justice for the people. Those  are  the\r\n\r\nright  things. If you want the right things,  surely\r\n\r\nyou must have the right people to recommend. You  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  the wrong people to make a  mess  of  the\r\n\r\nright things. If we are agreed that the right things\r\n\r\nare  prosperity  and  so on, surely  [Interruption].\r\n\r\nHealthy  for  women! Yes. Surely we  must  have  the\r\n\r\nright people, and the right Committee. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nargument  there is in that. What do we want?  Do  we\r\n\r\nwant  the  wrong people to make a mess of the  whole\r\n\r\nthing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we support this motion because, far from what\r\n\r\nwas  suggested by the Barisan - that it  is  an  anti-Indonesian  project - we feel  that  it  is  an  anti.\r\n\r\nCommunist project. That is why we are supporting it.\r\n\r\nThey  want  independence for Borneo before Malaysia,\r\n\r\nand  they say, \"What is the hurry? Why should  there\r\n\r\nnot  be  independence  first?  Why  must  there   be\r\n\r\nMalaysia  straightaway?\" I say this, Sir. The  hurry\r\n\r\nis  this: we are running a race not with people like\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Nee  Soon  and  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown - I think they are quite innocent   - but  we\r\n\r\nare running a race with the Communists who are very,\r\n\r\nvery  dangerous  people. You  know,  Sir,  Communism\r\n\r\nthrives   and  breeds  best  among  poverty-stricken\r\n\r\npeople.  The Member for Queenstown, as was mentioned\r\n\r\njust  now  by  the  Parliamentary Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour, was with me in Kuching for that\r\n\r\nconference. If I am not mistaken, he also did what I\r\n\r\ndid  - visited the different parts of Kuching and went\r\n\r\nto  see how the indigenous people live. I am sure he\r\n\r\nmust  agree with me that the conditions ire far from\r\n\r\nwhat  he and I would call satisfactory, Sir, so much\r\n\r\nso  that - it is not now that I, feel it but  at  that\r\n\r\ntime  when I spoke to the authorities there  - I said.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think that this State of affairs is ideal\r\n\r\nfor  Communism to breed in?\" I asked him that,  Sir,\r\n\r\nand  I  do  not want to go into the details  of  his\r\n\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> What was the answer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> That is why, Sir, I feel that\r\n\r\nwe cannot afford to delay. I shall endeavour to give\r\n\r\nthe reasons why I feel that we cannot delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, as I said, the Communists are not\r\n\r\nthe people whom we can play around with. We all know\r\n\r\nthat  their creed is to dominate the world.  Are  we\r\n\r\ngoing  to allow it? If not, what are we going to  do\r\n\r\nabout  it?  Secondly,  it  has  been  accepted  that\r\n\r\nCommunism rests on the assumption that the  tide  of\r\n\r\nhistory is in their favour. And recent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevents, Sir, have more than proved that their aim is\r\n\r\nto  make this tide flow faster. Thirdly, why I  feel\r\n\r\nit  is to their interest for us to delay is that the\r\n\r\nCommunist choice of weapons is very, very wide,  and\r\n\r\nunimpaired  by  moral considerations. For  instance,\r\n\r\nSir, their agents are world wide. They are found  in\r\n\r\nthe  World  Peace Council, the World  Federation  of\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions,  the World Federation  of  Democratic\r\n\r\nYouth,  the  International Association of Democratic\r\n\r\nLawyers,   the   World  Congress  of  Doctors,   the\r\n\r\nInternational Organisation of Journalists. In  every\r\n\r\nsection  of the world population there is a  section\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Communists can work  through,  and  work\r\n\r\nfast,  with all these organisations. There  was  one\r\n\r\norganisation,  Sir, the World Federation  of  Women,\r\n\r\nwhich   I   see   in   the  directory   of   women's\r\n\r\norganisations of the world. I do not see any reports\r\n\r\nof this organisation recently. I do not know whether\r\n\r\nit still exists, and so I have not mentioned it. But\r\n\r\nit  is  found  in  the directory  of  world  women's\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Democratic Women's\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, these organisations can\r\n\r\nbe  mobilised  to  organise  campaigns  at  suitable\r\n\r\nmoments. They have branches in most countries,  even\r\n\r\nin  countries where Communism is banned.  The  World\r\n\r\nPeace Council itself, Sir, has representations in 74\r\n\r\ncountries. The World Federation of Trade Unions  has\r\n\r\nrepresentations in 64 countries, until then  58;  it\r\n\r\nhas increased since then. With representations in 64\r\n\r\ncountries  they  have 88 million workers  supporting\r\n\r\nthem, and 60 million of these 88 million are in non-Communist  countries.  We  can  see  the   rate   of\r\n\r\ninfiltration.  That is why I feel it very  important\r\n\r\nthat we do not delay any longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to show you the speed at which they work.\r\n\r\nThis  organisation  which I was talking  about,  the\r\n\r\nWorld   Federation   of  Trade  Unions,   which   is\r\n\r\nrepresented in 64 countries and with the support  of\r\n\r\n88  million workers, was started towards the end  of\r\n\r\nlast war - around 1945, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthink, I do not know the exact date -  by whom? By the\r\n\r\nBritish  Trades  Union Congress.  When  it  started,\r\n\r\nRussia  insisted  that the post of Secretary-General\r\n\r\nmust  be  given to the Russian delegate. Having  got\r\n\r\nthat   positions  within  three  years,  Sir,   they\r\n\r\ncommanded  a  Communist majority  in  the  Executive\r\n\r\nBureau, the Executive Commission, and in the General\r\n\r\nCouncil.  So  much  so  that by  1949,  the  British\r\n\r\ndelegates  found  it advisable to  withdraw  on  the\r\n\r\nadvice  of Arthur Deakin. This is what he said  when\r\n\r\nhe advised them to withdraw:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We started with an honest intention. But we were\r\n\r\nnot dealing with honest men.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, someone said - I am sorry I for-got the\r\n\r\nname - that  the  communists  believe  that  the  flag\r\n\r\nfollows  the  trade; opposite to  what  the  British\r\n\r\nbelieve. The British believe that trade follows  the\r\n\r\nflag.  We  could  see this happening  and  we  could\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  it because there are manifestations  of\r\n\r\nit,  if  we look at the position of trade in Eastern\r\n\r\nEurope and in the Soviet bloc. The Communist bloc is\r\n\r\nmoving very fast. Eastern Europe, which used to have\r\n\r\n9  per  cent of Egypt's trade in 1953; has  absorbed\r\n\r\nonly  3.2  per  cent of Egypt's trade by  1958.  The\r\n\r\nSoviet  bloc  took only half a per cent  of  Syria's\r\n\r\nexports in the first half of 1957, but by the end of\r\n\r\n1958 they commanded 21 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Sir, in every way they are progressing\r\n\r\nso  fast that if we are to hope to win the race,  we\r\n\r\ntoo must move very fast, because a day's delay, Sir,\r\n\r\nmeans  one  extra day for the Communists to  exploit\r\n\r\nthe  position.  Every  strike and  unrest,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nreported  back  to Communist headquarters.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike   to  quote  from  this  little  booklet,   the\r\n\r\nCommunist Plan for World Domination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To sum up, the moves in a Communist propaganda\r\n\r\ncampaign are roughly as follows...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and  it  goes on - 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, 6 and 7. I am really\r\n\r\ninterested in 6 and 7, and I will read 6:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`6. Results: Perhaps strikes, perhaps merely\r\n\r\nnumbers,  signatures, or demonstrators are  reported\r\n\r\nback to Moscow. Claims of huge success [this is what\r\n\r\nI am interested in] are published in other countries\r\n\r\nand  the  Fronts emphasise the world-wide search  of\r\n\r\nfeeling\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin favour of the policy.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then in summing up, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Propaganda may, of course, be used as the first\r\n\r\nstep  of  a  long  campaign  of  subversion.  It  is\r\n\r\nparticularly  useful in the war  of  nerves  against\r\n\r\nsocial democrats which develops when Communists gain\r\n\r\na foothold in a parliamentary democracy.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore,  Sir, you see why I say that every  day's\r\n\r\ndelay is an extra day for them to exploit us. It  is\r\n\r\nhorrifying  to think that every strike in Singapore,\r\n\r\nprobably  with  the most sincere  intention  of  the\r\n\r\nlabourers  to try and get better terms  of  service,\r\n\r\nbetter salaries for themselves, is reported back and\r\n\r\nused  as  propaganda for the Communists against  our\r\n\r\nown country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the quicker we act, the better it\r\n\r\nis for us. And I appeal to all those who claim to be\r\n\r\nanti-Communists or even non-Communists  to  try  and\r\n\r\nhelp  turn this tide which the Communists are trying\r\n\r\ntheir  best  to make flow in their favour.  Try  and\r\n\r\nturn  the  tide. The best way to do it  is  for  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic forces like Singapore, Malaya and  Borneo\r\n\r\nto unite, because unity is strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  the  Member for Hong Lim  has  said  quite\r\n\r\ncorrectly  that  all  right-thinking  people  should\r\n\r\nsupport  the  principle  and  concept  of  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  follows  logically  that  those  who\r\n\r\noppose the principle of the concept of Malaysia must\r\n\r\nbe out of their minds. But we must carefully examine\r\n\r\nthe  lunacy  of those who oppose this  principle  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  We  have in this Assembly  an  incredible\r\n\r\nsituation  where the Barisan Sosialis  is  the  only\r\n\r\nParty that has opposed the motion in the name of the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. But it would be foolish indeed if we\r\n\r\nwere  to  think  that  the  people  in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are just mad men. I will prove to the House\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a sinister motive and method  behind\r\n\r\nthe apparent lunacy of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time and again it has been said by us and by\r\n\r\nMembers  on  the Opposition Benches themselves  that\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis is taking the line from outside\r\n\r\nsources. In other words, many of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>13 Barisan Assemblymen sitting on the opposite side\r\n\r\nare  not  the  people who decide  or  determine  the\r\n\r\nobjects of the Party or the line of the Party;  many\r\n\r\nof  them  are  mere  stooges, and there  are  bigger\r\n\r\npeople behind the scenes who are directing which way\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis should go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson, Mr Bani, attended two\r\n\r\nC.P.A.  Consultative Solidarity Committee  meetings.\r\n\r\nOne  was held on the 18th and 19th of December  last\r\n\r\nyear  in  Kuching, and the other in Kuala Lumpur  on\r\n\r\n7th  and 8th of January this year. At that time, the\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson did not disagree with the idea of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  The  very  fact  that  he  attended   the\r\n\r\nmeetings  would  obviously indicate that  his  Party\r\n\r\nsupports the idea of Malaysia. But suddenly  on  the\r\n\r\n18th  of  January, when we were having a  debate  on\r\n\r\nWest  Irian,  the  Member for  Thomson  uttered  two\r\n\r\nstartling statements. Firstly, he said that Malaysia\r\n\r\nis   anti-Indonesia.  Secondly,  Indonesia  is   the\r\n\r\nheartland of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have to find out why is it that the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson has taken a sudden change in the  line.\r\n\r\nThe  reason  is  quite simple if I  were  to  inform\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the House that the Communist  Party  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  the P.K.I., moved a resolution  opposing\r\n\r\nMalaysia  on 31st December, 1961. Therefore,  before\r\n\r\nthis resolution of the P.K.I. was issued, Members of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis would not know which  line  to\r\n\r\nadopt. After that resolution was issued on the  31st\r\n\r\nDecember, 1961, it filtered down to Singapore to the\r\n\r\nBarisan.  That was why on the 18th of  January,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson  uttered  these  two  startling\r\n\r\nstatements,  namely, that Malaysia is anti-Indonesia\r\n\r\nand  Indonesia is the heartland of Malaysia.  It  is\r\n\r\nvery   obvious,  Mr  Speaker,  that  a  number   of\r\n\r\nAssemblymen from the Barisan Sosialis did  not  know\r\n\r\nthat  this  resolution had been taken by the  P.K.I.\r\n\r\nand  that  this  was  the  line  for  the  Communist\r\n\r\nfollowers in Singapore to adopt. That would  explain\r\n\r\nvery clearly the sudden twist in the Barisan policy.\r\n\r\nIt  is  rather absurd for Mr Lim Ching  Siong,  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis,   to\r\n\r\npronounce at the Kuala\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLumpur  Malayan Socialist Conference that it is  the\r\n\r\nP.K.I. who  is following the Barisan  and  not  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  that is following the P.K.I. May  I  remind\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House that the Communist  Party  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia,   the  P.K.I.,  is  the   third   largest\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party in the world'? Who is  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.K.I. should  follow  it?  The  Barisan\r\n\r\ncompared to the P.K.I., is only a Party of piddlers.\r\n\r\nYou  would not expect their Chairman, Mr Aidit, and\r\n\r\nhis  followers, to follow the Member for  Nee  Soon,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Thomson or the Secretary General  of\r\n\r\nthe   Barisan  Sosialis.  They  are  faced  with   a\r\n\r\nridiculous situation where the Secretary-General  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis is only a big frog in a  small\r\n\r\nwell, saying that it is the P.K.I. that follows  the\r\n\r\nBarisan and not the Barisan that follows the P.K.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nincidentally  also  said in Kuala  Lumpur  that  the\r\n\r\nlatest   allegation  against  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers  was  that they were reactionary Communists;\r\n\r\nthat is, as if reactionary Communists were something\r\n\r\nand  progressive Communists something else. But  you\r\n\r\nwill  notice that he never at that conference denied\r\n\r\nthat  there are Communists in the Barisan  Sosialis.\r\n\r\nHe   just  tried  to  explain  that  there  may   be\r\n\r\nreactionary Communists in the Barisan and that there\r\n\r\nmay  also  be progressive Communists in the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  But may I also add that Lenin  also  said\r\n\r\nthat  there  are also good Communists and  infantile\r\n\r\nCommunists.  From what we can see,  there  arc  many\r\n\r\ninfantile Communists in the Barisan Sosialis. It  is\r\n\r\nrather   an  awkward  situation  that  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis face now, that they find themselves  taking\r\n\r\nthe  wrong stand, and having taken the wrong  stand,\r\n\r\nthen  try to explain it away or to white-wash  their\r\n\r\nstand  by  saying that we who support  Malaysia  are\r\n\r\nanti-Communists. Therefore, to follow  that  logical\r\n\r\nreasoning,  those  who  oppose  Malaysia   must   be\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning's newspapers gave quite a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  coverage  to the  so-called  Socialist\r\n\r\nConference in Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  have no doubt that Members of the House have read\r\n\r\nwhat  has  been  reported in the Press.  We  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are not against any political Party per  se.\r\n\r\nBut  it  is  quite logical that when the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nattacked, we must therefore reply. Here we have  Mr\r\n\r\nStephen   Yong,  Secretary-General  of  the  Sarawak\r\n\r\nUnited  People's Party, saying at the  Kuala  Lumpur\r\n\r\nConference, \"We do not wish to be liberated  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.\" Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. has no desire,  much\r\n\r\nless  the means, to extricate Mr Stephen Yong  from\r\n\r\nthe  soup that he is in. We have not the wherewithal\r\n\r\nto  liberate  the S.U.P.P. from the embrace  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists or the clutches of the Barisan. It is  up\r\n\r\nto Mr Stephen Yong himself to free his own Party so\r\n\r\nthat his Party will have its own independence there.\r\n\r\nIt  would  be churlish indeed, in fact it  would  be\r\n\r\npresumptuous, for the P.A.P. to say that we want  to\r\n\r\nliberate  him.  But I would say  to  the  people  in\r\n\r\nSarawak  that it is not the Federation of Malaya  or\r\n\r\nSingapore  or the P.A.P. that is going  to  liberate\r\n\r\nSarawak. All I say is this. If Sarawak does not wake\r\n\r\nup,  one  day  it will find that it is going  to  be\r\n\r\nliberated  by  people who have  got  the  guns,  the\r\n\r\naeroplanes  and the warships. I do not  believe  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore and the people of the Federation\r\n\r\nare  that war-like that we will go around liberating\r\n\r\nSarawak. On the contrary a large number of people in\r\n\r\nSarawak  and the Borneo territories, have  expressed\r\n\r\ntheir  real  fears  that either they  come  together\r\n\r\nunited  with the Federation of Malaya and  Singapore\r\n\r\nand so preserve their own integrity, or one day they\r\n\r\nwill be \"liberated\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysia Socialist Conference\r\n\r\npassed a number of resolutions one of which reads as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Strongly condemn the White Paper on merger\r\n\r\nbetween   Singapore  and  Malaya  and  the   present\r\n\r\nMalaysia  proposals of the Alliance and the  British\r\n\r\nGovernments  as  being hostile  to  the  concept  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia and directed against progressive forces  in\r\n\r\nthis  region  and  aimed as  a  military  threat  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I would like to take up that point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is from the Straits Times, is\r\n\r\nit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes, it is from the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes of today.

(2) Malaysia is a  military\r\n\r\nthreat to Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our minds, the concept of Malaysia is\r\n\r\nvery   simple  indeed.  It  means  that  the  five\r\n\r\nterritories   of   the   Federation   of   Malaya.\r\n\r\nSingapore,  North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei  come\r\n\r\ntogether as a single unit - to be united as a single\r\n\r\nState.  That is our concept of Malaysia. So  I  do\r\n\r\nnot possibly see how such a concept can be hostile\r\n\r\nto  the  concept of Malaysia. This is where  those\r\n\r\nwho  supported this resolution at the Kuala Lumpur\r\n\r\nConference should clarify to the people.  What  is\r\n\r\ntheir  concept of Malaysia? Does their concept  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  mean  in  the terms of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson,  that  Indonesia  is  the  heartland   of\r\n\r\nMalaysia?  If that is so, then I fully agree  that\r\n\r\nthe  union  of our five territories - the Federation\r\n\r\nof    Malaya,   Borneo,   Sarawak,   Brunei    and\r\n\r\nSingapore - is not in keeping with the thinking that\r\n\r\nwas  propounded by the Member for Thomson, namely,\r\n\r\nthat Indonesia is the heartland of Malaysia. It is\r\n\r\nquite  likely that when they moved this resolution\r\n\r\nyesterday,  at  the back of their minds  they  did\r\n\r\nthink that the union of these five territories  is\r\n\r\nhostile to their concept of Malaysia. It is rather\r\n\r\nstupid  of  the so-called socialists  to  consider\r\n\r\nsuch a union of our five territories as a military\r\n\r\nthreat  to Indonesia. Sir, we are not soldiers  in\r\n\r\nthis  House. It is pretty obvious even from common\r\n\r\nsense that to be a military threat to any country,\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all,  we  must  have  the  means,   the\r\n\r\nwherewithal,  the arms, the forces  which  can  be\r\n\r\npoised to attack. There are only 10 million people\r\n\r\nin  the five territories of the proposed State  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  there  are 96  million  people,  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  Can 10 million people  of  the  future\r\n\r\nState  of  Malaysia  be  a threat  to  96  million\r\n\r\nIndonesians? Why should such a concept of Malaysia\r\n\r\nbe  a threat to Indonesia? If there are powers  to\r\n\r\nthreaten Indonesia, it must be the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolonial   powers.   The   Indonesians   know   it\r\n\r\nthemselves.  It  was  the Dutch.  We  supported  a\r\n\r\nmotion in which we agreed to the Indonesian  claim\r\n\r\nto  West Irian. That was because Dutch colonialism\r\n\r\nwas  a  threat to Indonesia. But 10 million people\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia  cannot  be a threat  to  96  million\r\n\r\nIndonesians. Let me quote a statement made by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia  during\r\n\r\nthe  debate on West Irian in the General  Assembly\r\n\r\nof the United Nations on 20th November, 1961. This\r\n\r\nis what Dr Subandrio said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are not only disclaiming the territories\r\n\r\noutside the former Netherlands East Indies, though\r\n\r\nthey  are of the same island, but more than  that,\r\n\r\nwhen  Malaya  told us of her intentions  to  merge\r\n\r\nwith  the three British Crown Colonies of Sarawak,\r\n\r\nBrunei and British North Borneo as one Federation,\r\n\r\nwe  told them that we have no objections and  that\r\n\r\nwe  wish  them  success with this merger  so  that\r\n\r\nevery one may live in peace and freedom.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"So that every one may live in peace and freedom.\"\r\n\r\nThat is what Malaysia intends to do: that Malaysia\r\n\r\nwill  live  side by side in peace with  the  Great\r\n\r\nRepublic  of  Indonesia. We have no  intention  of\r\n\r\nliberating other territories; we have no intention\r\n\r\nof  aggrandizement. How then  can  Malaysia  be  a\r\n\r\nthreat to Indonesia, when the Minister for Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs,  Dr  Subandrio, stated  in  the  General\r\n\r\nAssembly that his country wished that this merger,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  Malaysia, will meet with success?  Who  are\r\n\r\nthe people who adopt the stand against Malaysia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Wednesday, the Straits Times published a\r\n\r\nresolution moved by the P.K.I. opposing  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty obvious to all people who can add one\r\n\r\nand  one are two and not three, that not only  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, but those who were in charge  of\r\n\r\nthis  so-called Malaysian Socialist Conference  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur were doing nothing but purely taking\r\n\r\nup  the  P.K.I. line.  It is  a  sad  thing,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that a group of people should seize  upon\r\n\r\nthe  word \"socialist\" and proclaim themselves also\r\n\r\nas  democrats when at the Kuala Lumpur  Conference\r\n\r\nthose  who were in charge of that meeting  refused\r\n\r\nto  agree to discuss a paper on Malaysia submitted\r\n\r\nby the PAP. The so-called democrats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat the Socialist Conference were afraid of the facts\r\n\r\nand  arguments which would argue for  the  cause  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   Because   of  that,   an   extraordinary\r\n\r\nstatement  was issued that the P.A.P. bad  prejudged\r\n\r\nthe issue. But it is really the other way round.  Is\r\n\r\nit   not   possible  that  those  who  wanted   that\r\n\r\nconference to oppose Malaysia had also prejudged the\r\n\r\nissue?  In  fact,  they were  prepared  to  receive\r\n\r\npapers  or to listen to speeches which were  against\r\n\r\nMalaysia. These are the so-called democrats and  so-called socialists who refuse to agree to even  allow\r\n\r\na   delegation,  an  invited  delegate,   at   their\r\n\r\nconference to speak on what was considered  a  basis\r\n\r\nfor the argument that Malaysia should be founded  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as possible. In fact, the P.A.P. went  to  the\r\n\r\nConference  just as much as we went  to  the  C.P.A.\r\n\r\nSolidarity   Consultative   Conference   with    the\r\n\r\nunderstanding  that those who attended  the  meeting\r\n\r\nwould agree on the idea of Malaysia. It was called a\r\n\r\nMalaysian Socialist Conference to discuss Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, Sir, if we had known right from the\r\n\r\nbeginning  that that conference had no intention  at\r\n\r\nall  of accepting Malaysia, then it would have  been\r\n\r\ncorrect  for us not to attend that meeting,  hut  to\r\n\r\ndecline  the invitation. We do not wish to attend  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  where the idea is to disagree. We  wish  to\r\n\r\nattend  a meeting of parties where agreement can  be\r\n\r\nreached.  It was a sad case indeed that we misjudged\r\n\r\nthe   intentions   of  those  who   organised   that\r\n\r\nconference in Kuala Lumpur. We had accepted in  good\r\n\r\nfaith  that they would receive the idea of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  would put out concrete proposals how socialists\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia could come together to help to  advance\r\n\r\nthe  cause of Malaysia. Instead my colleagues to the\r\n\r\ndelegation,   the   Minister   for   Culture,    the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   `Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation, Mr Devan Nair, Mr Jek Yuen Thong, Inche\r\n\r\nRahim Ishak, were treated with a show of booing  and\r\n\r\nshouts  of,  \"Go back to Singapore!\" The Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, who is not here now, took great  delight\r\n\r\nin  this  Chamber  just now that my  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture, was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbooed  at.

Sir, we could\r\n\r\nnot   care   less   what  grandiose  statement,   or\r\n\r\nresolution that conference at Kuala Lumpur issued on\r\n\r\nour  expulsion. We could not care less. We know that\r\n\r\nthere   are   bigger   people  behind   the   scenes\r\n\r\ncontrolling  the  conference. The  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nConference himself admitted that he attended -  here,\r\n\r\nmay I quote from the Straits Times:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Inche Ishak added: \"I went to Indonesia not\r\n\r\nbecause  my Party sent me or my Party paid  for  me,\r\n\r\nhut to learn and to see for myself.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite correct - Chairman of Labour Party. Inche Ishak,\r\n\r\nChairman of Party Raakyat, Inche Boestamam, attended\r\n\r\na  Parti  Indo  conference, a  conference  of  Party\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  I put it to the House, supposing  I,  or\r\n\r\nany  of  my  colleagues, had  attended  a  political\r\n\r\nmeeting  organised by some foreign  country  and  we\r\n\r\ncame  back here, would we be dubbed as nationalists?\r\n\r\nDo  we  fight really for the benefit and welfare  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, Malaya and Malaysia? Do we or do we  not?\r\n\r\nThe  inference is quite clear. A conference was held\r\n\r\nof  Parti  Indo  in  Jakarta sometime  in  December,\r\n\r\nattended  by  the  Chairman of  Party  Raakyat,  the\r\n\r\nChairman  of the Labour Party has admitted  in  this\r\n\r\nstatement. Suddenly we find a change in the line  on\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  What other conclusions can we draw  other\r\n\r\nthan  that the line was laid down in Jakarta? It  is\r\n\r\nnot the Member for Nee Soon who, I hope, is going to\r\n\r\nspeak  after  me, who decides what the Barisan  line\r\n\r\nis,  or  his colleagues sitting down there. The  big\r\n\r\nchaps  who will decide the Barisan line are  not  in\r\n\r\nthis  chamber.  They are outside.  I  say  that  our\r\n\r\nBarisan Members in this Chamber are just puppets and\r\n\r\nstooges,  and  I  feel sorry for  them  because,  at\r\n\r\nleast,  when they were in the P.A.P. we  had  weekly\r\n\r\nAssemblymen's meeting where they could criticise  us\r\n\r\nand scold us for any shortcomings, and they could at\r\n\r\nleast  try  to have a say in formulating  the  Party\r\n\r\nline. But these poor 13 Assemblymen are now stranded\r\n\r\nlike  fish  amidst a flotsam on the  shore.  I  feel\r\n\r\nsorry for them indeed. So it is very clear that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  the  six other so-called socialist Parties  at\r\n\r\nthis Kuala Lumpur Conference, are just adopting  the\r\n\r\nP.K.I. resolution moved on 31st  December,  or,  at\r\n\r\nleast,  issued on 31st December. We could understand\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Member  for  Thomson,  Mr  Bani,  at  two\r\n\r\nsuccessive   meetings  of  the   C.P.A.

That\r\n\r\nwas  the tactic, the line, the direction given  that\r\n\r\nis now being adopted by the Barisan. I will say that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. first  and foremost  is  a  nationalist\r\n\r\nParty.  I can say this for me and for a good  number\r\n\r\nof  my colleagues, that we formed the Party to fight\r\n\r\ncolonialism because we were nationalists and against\r\n\r\nBritish  colonialism. We are still nationalists  and\r\n\r\nwe  have always put the cause of nationalism  first.\r\n\r\nWe put party ideology second. I say that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is not a nationalist Party. It is prepared\r\n\r\nto  sacrifice the interest of the people of Malaysia\r\n\r\nin  the interest of the Communist ideology. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  they  are  prepared to be a  stooge  of  the\r\n\r\nP.K.I.  They  were  all for the liberation  of  West\r\n\r\nIrian. They were very enthusiastic indeed. They were\r\n\r\nvery  keen to liberate West Irian. They put up three\r\n\r\ngirls as a front - as the vanguard. The women are  the\r\n\r\nvanguard and the men are the rearguard. The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis were very keen to liberate West Irian.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  it  comes  to the interest of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,   the   long-term   interest    of    the\r\n\r\nheterogenous  people  who live  in  the  territories\r\n\r\nwhich we call Malaysia -  the Malays, the Chinese, the\r\n\r\nIndians, the Dyaks and the Ibans - the people  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis say that such a concept  is  anti-Indonesian, it is a military threat to Indonesia and\r\n\r\nthat, instead, Indonesia should be the heartland  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.

He said - and this  is\r\n\r\nto  be  found in the Straits Times of 17th  October,\r\n\r\n1961, at page 10:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to say at this point that the word\r\n\r\n\"merger\" has generally come to be accepted as a  way\r\n\r\nof    expressing    the   future   integration    of\r\n\r\nconstitutional relations between the Federation  and\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But let us not forget that  the  broader\r\n\r\nconcept  of Malaysia of course is a merger too,  hut\r\n\r\non a larger scale.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He continued to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Therefore when I refer to \"merger\", it will be\r\n\r\ndirectly  in  relation  to  Singapore  and  also  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia  because  merger  with  Singapore   is   an\r\n\r\nessential part of the Malaysia ideal.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  in the new proposed Malaysia, Singapore cannot\r\n\r\nbe   accepted   on   the  basis  of   equality   and\r\n\r\nproportionate   representation.   This   has    been\r\n\r\nestablished  as  a  fact. Singapore  would  only  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  on  the  basis of partnership  in  Command\r\n\r\nPaper  No.  33 of 1961 which sets out the  heads  of\r\n\r\nagreement  for  a merger between the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  Singapore. In the first  page  of  this\r\n\r\ndocument,  Sir, the Prime Minister of Singapore,  in\r\n\r\nhis  letter to the Prime Minister of the Federation,\r\n\r\nmade  it very clear that he understood that Malaysia\r\n\r\nmeant the participation of Singapore on the basis of\r\n\r\nP.A.P. merger contained in this White Paper, for  he\r\n\r\nhad written in his letter to the Tunku - I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>`My dear Prime Minister,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall that in our discussions on the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  framework to effect  the  merger  of\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation of Malaya in  the  new\r\n\r\nFederation   of   Malaysia   we   agreed   upon    a\r\n\r\nmemorandum...'-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>making  it  very clear that insofar as Singapore  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, merger and Malaysia is one and  the  same\r\n\r\nthing.  Yet, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is this strange\r\n\r\nattempt  to  pass  off Malaysia as  something  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  the  P.A.P. merger,  and  the  more\r\n\r\nsurprising  part  of the story is  that  there  were\r\n\r\npeople gullible enough to swallow this line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have seen Members who outright rejected\r\n\r\nCommand Paper No. 33\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  1961 in this House and yet supported this motion\r\n\r\nafter making high-falutin speeches in support  of  a\r\n\r\nvague  concept which was never meant to  apply.  The\r\n\r\nconcept of bringing smaller nations together under a\r\n\r\nplanned  economy  for  the  mutual  betterment   and\r\n\r\nupliftment  of  each  other is laudable  and  is  in\r\n\r\nkeeping  with  socialist thinking and  is  something\r\n\r\nthat  no  socialist  can  reject.  But,  is  planned\r\n\r\neconomy the objective of the proposed Malaysia?  No,\r\n\r\nit  is not. And all honest people know and say  that\r\n\r\nit  is not. But then, how is that that certain self-proclaimed socialists still support this Plan? There\r\n\r\nmust  be quite a lot of political confusion in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  on  this  issue.  But  then,  Sir,  political\r\n\r\nconfusion does not seem to be anything new  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, for during the debate on the motion on merger\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the Minister for Labour, we had witnessed\r\n\r\nhow adept and expertly the Member for Cairnhill, who\r\n\r\nhas just left the Chamber, was in the art of turning\r\n\r\npolitical  somersaults.  He  had  so  very  fiercely\r\n\r\nattacked  the Government for calling something  that\r\n\r\nwas  obviously not a merger a merger, and  when  it\r\n\r\ncame  to  an  amendment expressing his doubts  in  a\r\n\r\npositive form, he rejected it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It now appears, Sir, that the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nis  not  alone  in this House in the  art  of  being\r\n\r\npolitic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is my intention to\r\n\r\ndevelop my arguments in three phases on this motion.\r\n\r\nFirstly, I want to show that as far as Singapore  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, Malaysia means P.A.P. merger, and  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmerger  means Malaysia. I hope I have made my  point\r\n\r\nvery  clear and will not want to further labour  the\r\n\r\nHouse  on  the obvious. So far as we in the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are  concerned, we are consistent  in  our\r\n\r\npolitical stand. We have rejected the P.A.P. merger\r\n\r\nas  contained in Command Paper No. 33  of  1961.  We\r\n\r\ntherefore  are  now moral-bound and honour-bound  to\r\n\r\nreject  this motion before the House. Secondly,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The P.K.I. has said no\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> - I intend to trace the\r\n\r\npolitical  background that led to the P.A.P. merger\r\n\r\nand  the concept of Malaysia insofar as the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  has given this House his side  of  the\r\n\r\nstory  - though  it was quite uncalled  for,  because\r\n\r\nwhat he said were the second-hand extracts from  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's broadcast talks recently. In  view\r\n\r\nof  this, Sir, I am sure the House will hear me  out\r\n\r\nwith  indulgence. Further, the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nwas   reiterating  propaganda  material  which   has\r\n\r\nalready been tabled in this House and distributed to\r\n\r\nall  Members  in  the form of a  booklet  named  The\r\n\r\nBattle for Merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about propaganda booklets, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I am reminded of the story told to  me\r\n\r\nof   the   embarrassment  of   the   United   States\r\n\r\nInformation  Service in Hongkong not  so  very  long\r\n\r\nago.   The  U.S.I.S. used  to  produce  a  lot   of\r\n\r\npropaganda booklets for distribution in Hongkong and\r\n\r\nother   South-East   Asian  countries.   They   were\r\n\r\nextremely  pleased with themselves when  they  found\r\n\r\nthat as soon as the booklets were produced they went\r\n\r\nout  of  circulation and reprints  had  to  go  into\r\n\r\npress.  But  after some time, they  discovered  that\r\n\r\nnobody  seemed to have heard of - far less read of - the\r\n\r\ninformation contained in those booklets and  it  was\r\n\r\nonly after a great deal of trouble and investigation\r\n\r\nthat  they  found, to their great dismay, that  some\r\n\r\nenterprising paper-mill had taken care of all  their\r\n\r\npublications!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Some of your henchmen carry it\r\n\r\naround.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> The propaganda booklets had\r\n\r\nmet  their inglorious end in the pulping machine  of\r\n\r\nthe  paper-mill.

The paper mill  owner\r\n\r\nwas,  I  am told, by no means a Communist or even  a\r\n\r\npro-Communist. On the contrary, he was  a  real  and\r\n\r\ntrue  capitalist. He was quite ready to explore  and\r\n\r\nexploit every\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\navenue that could bring in profit. But the Americans\r\n\r\nin  Hongkong had some decency left, for they did not\r\n\r\nattempt  to smear the owner of the paper-mill  as  a\r\n\r\nCommunist.  Quite  unlike  the  P.A.P.,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir. In the third part of my  argument,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  retrace some  of  the  events  that\r\n\r\ntranspired after the Tunku made his proposals and of\r\n\r\nthe  Communist and pro-Communist smear of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nagainst  all those who did not see eye to  eye  with\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will begin where the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  passed off. It is a pity he is not  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse now. I will begin in the pre-general elections\r\n\r\nera  when the P.A.P. was supposed to be at the  peak\r\n\r\nof  political good fortune. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nI  was  alleged  to have joined the  P.A.P. at  the\r\n\r\nheight of its popularity and scooted on the day when\r\n\r\nthe  fortunes of the P.A.P. were at its lowest  ebb.\r\n\r\nObviously, Sir, the purpose of the allegation is  to\r\n\r\nbrand   me   as   an  opportunist,   for   character\r\n\r\nassassination is the spearhead of the vicious  smear\r\n\r\ncampaign  of  the P.A.P. The leaders of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nknew  that it would be laying it on too thick  if  I\r\n\r\nwere called a Communist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Fair enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Has the Member forgotten he\r\n\r\ntold  me  that  he  did not think that  even  if  he\r\n\r\napplied for membership, the Communists would  accept\r\n\r\nhim  because  he  did not have enough  iron  in  his\r\n\r\nstomach?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, my\r\n\r\npoint  is  exactly that, because the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nknew it would be laying it on too thick to brand  me\r\n\r\nas a Communist.

There  was\r\n\r\npractically  a pathological fear, in the  hearts  of\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. leadership,  of  the  electorate   who\r\n\r\nreturned them to office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was heard to comment on many occasions that if the system of democracy as interpreted into one man one vote was to be operated, in the sense of the word it would lead us all to ruination. I myself, Sir, would have used the word \"ruin\". Even my friends from Sarawak have heard\r\n\r\nhis  utterances  in this respect and  have  had  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of his advice to do something about  it  in\r\n\r\nSarawak since the system of one man one vote is  not\r\n\r\nyet  operative  there. As fear  began  to  grip  the\r\n\r\nimagination of the P.A.P. leadership, they began  to\r\n\r\nlose their sense of proportion. As the popularity of\r\n\r\nthe Party and of the Government dwindled from day to\r\n\r\nday,  they  decided that they would throw  the  ball\r\n\r\nhack to the people, particularly after Hong Lim, for\r\n\r\nthen they hoped going to the country would kill  two\r\n\r\nbirds with one stone. For in doing so it would  also\r\n\r\nhave  saved the face of the Prime Minister from  the\r\n\r\nsound thrashing he received in Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You campaigned too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> Oh, yes, unfortunately, and\r\n\r\nfortunately  not effective enough.
