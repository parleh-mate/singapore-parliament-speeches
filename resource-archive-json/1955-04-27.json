Some were offered\r\n\r\nalternative  resettlement in Jurong,  14  miles  away\r\n\r\nfrom  where they are living at present, but  most  of\r\n\r\nthem were told that they would have to find their own\r\n\r\naccommodation.  Well, I ask you, Sir,  how  are  they\r\n\r\ngoing  to  find accommodation in one month?  I  admit\r\n\r\nthey knew these things were coming when the land  was\r\n\r\nacquired  some two years ago, but, as we  know  human\r\n\r\nnature,  one always hopes for the best; and now  they\r\n\r\nare  suddenly  faced with this terrible problem.  The\r\n\r\ncompensation offered was inadequate, hardly enough to\r\n\r\npay  for  half  a hut, let alone cover  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nremoval  and rehabilitation. I am sure if  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  had  seen the misery of  these  people,  he\r\n\r\nwould have spoken with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch  more  feeling than he had yesterday.  He  would\r\n\r\nprobably  have described their feelings of resentment\r\n\r\nas fumes from hell instead of the slag-heap. Now I am\r\n\r\nsure  that  this  Government will immediately  change\r\n\r\nthis  policy  and extend to these unfortunate  people\r\n\r\nand  to the very, very many more who are about to  be\r\n\r\nevicted  the benevolence so well described  in  their\r\n\r\nFour-year Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore move the following amendment to be\r\n\r\ninserted after the words \"drastic measures.\" at  line\r\n\r\n5,  page  6 (line 8, column 8 of the Official Report)\r\n\r\nof His Excellency's Address:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In clearing slums and attap dwellings for public\r\n\r\nhousing,  or  public  works  like  the  international\r\n\r\nairport,    Government   will   provide   alternative\r\n\r\naccommodation-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Originally I intended to speak on\r\n\r\nthis  subject,  as in the past two or  three  months,\r\n\r\nmany  of the electorate in my constituency have  been\r\n\r\nthreatened  with  notices to  quit,  and  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible I have been in consultation with those land-\r\n\r\nowners who served such notices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, we have the Rent Control Ordinance,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  very feeble indeed and does not offer  any\r\n\r\nassistance  to  these tenants who are being  evicted.\r\n\r\nThe  Ordinance  states that the Court may  decide  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the hardship suffered by the  people,\r\n\r\nbut  then  we  all  know that there  is  no  specific\r\n\r\ndirection in the manner in which the matter has to be\r\n\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, nearly 90 per cent of the\r\n\r\nelectorate  in the Seletar constituency  do  live  on\r\n\r\nprivate estates. They do not own any land at all.  If\r\n\r\nthey are farmers or if they are in other occupations,\r\n\r\nthey  depend entirely on the generosity of the  land-owners.  Vast  developments are taking place  in  the\r\n\r\nrural   areas   and  these  tenants  are   completely\r\n\r\nhelpless. We cannot obstruct development, but at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time we cannot see these tenants suffer in  any\r\n\r\nway. I feel that the Government should have made some\r\n\r\nrecommendations,  or  at  least  indicated  what  its\r\n\r\npolicy would be on matters of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally have inspected those houses which are\r\n\r\naffected by the notices and have seen for myself  the\r\n\r\nhardship  suffered  by  these people.  I  thought  of\r\n\r\nseeing  the Minister for Local Government, Lands  and\r\n\r\nHousing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat) soon after\r\n\r\nthis  sitting was over. But since this amended motion\r\n\r\nhas  been  put  forward, I take  the  opportunity  of\r\n\r\nexpressing  my  views  on  this  matter.  I  am   not\r\n\r\nsuggesting that any immediate reply should  be  given\r\n\r\nat  this sitting, but I urge that this amended motion\r\n\r\nbe   accepted   and  the  Government  make   suitable\r\n\r\nenquiries  into  the possibilities of  helping  these\r\n\r\npeople.  It  is  all well and good to  allot  them  a\r\n\r\nspecific area miles away from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  places where they have lived for many years, but\r\n\r\nthose resettlement camps have not proved to be a very\r\n\r\ncongenial place for the tenants to live in. They have\r\n\r\nno  proper roads, no lights and no water, and nothing\r\n\r\nto  suit  the  lively atmosphere of these  people.  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  the Government's immediate attention  to\r\n\r\nthis  matter,  and, therefore, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsupport this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  the Member for Paya Lebar  (Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nKoon Teck) has read sufficiently clearly that part of\r\n\r\nthe Governor's Address to understand the meaning that\r\n\r\nis   intended  to  be  conveyed;  that  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernor's   Address   to  which   he   referred - \"the\r\n\r\nGovernment  appreciates that this  challenge  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  the interests of attap  dwellers  and\r\n\r\nother  poorer people must be met by the most vigorous\r\n\r\nand in some cases drastic measures\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he reads that carefully I think it will appear\r\n\r\nquite clearly to him that the \"drastic measures\"  are\r\n\r\nnot  intended  to mean drastic measures  against  the\r\n\r\npoor  people  by giving them notice to quit - to  clear\r\n\r\nfrom their permanent homes or temporary homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front has many achievements, but today it\r\n\r\nseems  its greatest achievement is the conversion  of\r\n\r\nmany  members of the public, who have no  Socialistic\r\n\r\nideas  in their heads, to take interest on behalf  of\r\n\r\nthe poor people. For this reason only, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\noppose  the amendment to this motion. It is  a  clear\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding of the Governor's Address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

This is what His Excellency said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The imperative and pressing need for adequate\r\n\r\nhousing   for  those  in  the  lower  income   group,\r\n\r\nincluding  the solution of the problem of  the  attap\r\n\r\ndwellers  and  the  clearance  of  slum  areas  is  a\r\n\r\nchallenge which the Government appreciates  can  only\r\n\r\nbe met by the most vigorous and in some cases drastic\r\n\r\nmeasures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is the clearance of the slum areas, not the\r\n\r\nslum  dwellers, that calls for drastic  measures.  It\r\n\r\nmust  be obvious from the tenor of the entire Address\r\n\r\nthat  this is not aimed at the dwellers, but  at  the\r\n\r\nareas  for the assistance of the dwellers. And we  go\r\n\r\non, Sir, as regards the measures:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is the firm intention of the Government to find\r\n\r\nthe  solution to this problem and in doing so it will\r\n\r\nin the future place more emphasis on the provision of\r\n\r\npublic  housing at the lowest possible cost  even  if\r\n\r\nthis means some lowering of standards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one measure for the clearance of slums - the\r\n\r\nprovision of extremely low-cost housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the amendment adds - it also regrets that we\r\n\r\nhave  not mentioned provision of adequate alternative\r\n\r\nhousing  and  cost of removal and rehabilitation.  It\r\n\r\nseems  to be taken for granted by the mover  of  this\r\n\r\namendment,   and   those  who   support   him,   that\r\n\r\nGovernment,   far  from  seeking  to  alleviate   the\r\n\r\ndistress  of the slum dwellers, seeks to evict  them.\r\n\r\nThat  is a wholly false reading of the passage. There\r\n\r\nis  no  question of seeking drastic measures  against\r\n\r\nthe  dwellers, but seeking drastic measures  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  demolishing those places and  rebuilding\r\n\r\nthem and putting back the original dwellers as far as\r\n\r\npossible  into those homes. Sir, this has been  flung\r\n\r\nat  us again and again from the opposite side of  the\r\n\r\nHouse. If you will permit me, I should like to read a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npassage from it myself, from the Four-year Programme\r\n\r\nof the Labour Front concerning the slums:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Labour Front believes that no slum problem can\r\n\r\nbe solved by the mere provision of more houses. While\r\n\r\nthe provision of better homes is an important feature\r\n\r\nof  slum clearance, there are other vitally important\r\n\r\nfactors  which must be considered in any resettlement\r\n\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disregard of these factors has been the cause of\r\n\r\nthe Colony's failure to get rid of its slums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front's plan for clearing the slums is to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  each area as a composite population  unit\r\n\r\nand  to  accommodate the slum dwellers  in  healthier\r\n\r\nsurroundings as one composite unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will call for a careful study of the human\r\n\r\necology  of  each  slum area. It must  be  known  why\r\n\r\npeople  choose  to  remain in an  area  under  living\r\n\r\nconditions that are unhealthy and dangerous and which\r\n\r\nthey  themselves  obviously do not like  rather  than\r\n\r\nmove to homes that are healthier and better serviced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Labour Front believes that an important reason\r\n\r\nfor  this attachment to such surroundings is that the\r\n\r\npeople  work or earn their livelihood by catering  to\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the communal unit which they have built\r\n\r\naround themselves over a period of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask these people to move to a new area, however\r\n\r\ncongenial  it may be, without also moving  with  them\r\n\r\nthe  little trades, industries and occupations  which\r\n\r\nprovide  their  livelihood and their  recreation,  is\r\n\r\ndisastrous to any slum improvement plan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now we come, Sir, to the possibilities that open\r\n\r\nbefore us today:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A vast open area close to the centre of the city\r\n\r\nfalls  vacant very soon around Kallang Airport.  This\r\n\r\narea  ought  to  be developed into  a  vast  `transit\r\n\r\ncamp',  with the purpose of accommodating temporarily\r\n\r\nthe  entire population of a defined slum area pending\r\n\r\nthe demolition and rebuilding on modern lines of that\r\n\r\nparticular area. Thus, an entire population  of,  let\r\n\r\nus  say  area  'A' will go to Kallang Airport  for  a\r\n\r\nshort  time,  and then return to their original  area\r\n\r\n'A'  after  it has been rebuilt for them  with  every\r\n\r\nmodern  facility. No permanent dislocation  can  take\r\n\r\nplace in this way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is along those lines that we\r\n\r\nare now seeking to find a solution to the question of\r\n\r\nslums,  and I must confess it is with regret  that  I\r\n\r\nsee   an  amendment  which  seeks  to  twist, quite\r\n\r\nunintentionally I am sure, seeing the personality  of\r\n\r\nthe mover of that amendment, but which, nevertheless,\r\n\r\ntwists  the  simple  meaning  of  the  Address   into\r\n\r\nsomething vicious and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviolent,  aimed  against the interests  of  the  slum\r\n\r\ndwellers.  It  would indeed be appreciated,  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nthis  explanation can be accepted and  the  amendment\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.  I  can  see  no useful  purpose  that  it\r\n\r\nserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar (Mr M. P. D. Nair) has\r\n\r\nindicated that there should be, with reference to the\r\n\r\ntenants  of private land-owners, a further protection\r\n\r\nfor the poor tenant, and he has also indicated it was\r\n\r\nhis  hope  to  see the Minister for Local Government,\r\n\r\nLands  and Housing as soon as this sitting was  over.\r\n\r\nMay  I  say, on behalf of my colleague, that  such  a\r\n\r\nvisit  would  be  welcome and that  the  constructive\r\n\r\nsuggestions  which are contained in his speech  would\r\n\r\nbe  carefully considered? But that is not part of the\r\n\r\namendment  really, Sir, the question of the amendment\r\n\r\nof  the  Control of Rent Restriction Ordinance.  This\r\n\r\namendment  arises  out of an entire misconception  of\r\n\r\nthe  meaning of the paragraph at the top  of  page  6\r\n\r\n(second   paragraph,  column  8,  of  the   Official\r\n\r\nReport).   The  drastic  measures  we  envisage   are\r\n\r\nmeasures  of a character whereby we seek  to  acquire\r\n\r\nvested  landlord  interests in slum  areas,  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  demolishing those  unhealthy  units  and\r\n\r\nrebuilding thereon premises which are fit  for  human\r\n\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Members\r\n\r\nyesterday.  I  would first like to refer,  with  some\r\n\r\nsurprise, to the attack made by the Member for Queenstown  (Mr Lee Choon Eng) on the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lim  Choon Mong) for daring to make a reference\r\n\r\nto  the subject of hawkers. May I remind him that the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  is  not  the only  authority  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter, because hawkers also exist in the rural areas\r\n\r\nand the Rural Board is at present under the authority\r\n\r\nof  Government? The Member for Serangoon has, I  know\r\n\r\nfull  well,  done  a lot of practical  work  for  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  hawkers, and has recently acquired  land\r\n\r\nfor the shelter in Upper Serangoon Village of many of\r\n\r\nthose living in his own constituency. I hope that the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown will have no objection to that;\r\n\r\nnor  if  I take, as in fact I have taken, an interest\r\n\r\nin  the  hawker  problem in the rural  areas  of  the\r\n\r\nTanglin  constituency outside the West Ward area  for\r\n\r\nwhich he is City Councillor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown then launched himself into\r\n\r\nan  unsubstantiated attack on the Progressive  Party,\r\n\r\nalleging  that  it  had always  been  obstructive  to\r\n\r\nhawkers  in the City Council. May I suggest  that  he\r\n\r\ngive examples of the allegations at the next ordinary\r\n\r\nmeeting of the City Council, as he claims that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  is the right and proper place for consideration\r\n\r\nof  such  matters? In point of fact, as I believe  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  possible  in sticking to facts,  the  Health\r\n\r\nCommittee of the City Council has, I understand,  two\r\n\r\nProgressive and two Labour Front members, the  latter\r\n\r\nbeing  both  hon.  Members in this  House.  The  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  has therefore had an equal chance to get  his\r\n\r\npolicies adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed that during the course of this debate\r\n\r\na  number of hon. Members have, to the huge amusement\r\n\r\nof themselves, enjoyed using the Progressive Party as\r\n\r\nan  Aunt Sally, attributing to it all the ills,  real\r\n\r\nand   imaginary,  which  they  consider  beset   this\r\n\r\ncountry.  It  is as well to remind them of  one  more\r\n\r\nfact. The Progressives were not the party in power in\r\n\r\nthe last Government, but a small minority of six in a\r\n\r\nHouse  of  25.  Despite  this handicap,  an  enormous\r\n\r\nadvance  has been made in our social services through\r\n\r\nour  efforts, which has made Singapore  the  envy  of\r\n\r\nmany  countries.  What  the  people  want  more  than\r\n\r\nanything is more schools, more medical services, more\r\n\r\njobs.   Let   us   see  whether  the  Labour-Alliance\r\n\r\nGovernment with a]l the power in its hands, or almost\r\n\r\nall  the  power, can do all that much better  in  the\r\n\r\nnext   four  years  than  the  so-called  Progressive\r\n\r\nGovernment has done in the past four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further truth, unpalatable though it may be to\r\n\r\nsome  hon. Members, is that the vast change from  the\r\n\r\nAdvisory   Council  of  eight  years   ago   to   the\r\n\r\nconstitution  of  today,  which  the  Chief  Minister\r\n\r\npronounces as workable, would not have been  achieved\r\n\r\nso smoothly or so speedily if it had not been for the\r\n\r\nhard  work  put  in  by the Progressive  Party  while\r\n\r\nothers stood aside and looked on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

My first  wish  is  to  give\r\n\r\nconsideration  to the proposals on education,  and  I\r\n\r\nmust  state with regret that the nebulous  nature  of\r\n\r\nthe proposals gives us some misgivings. In the Labour\r\n\r\nFront  pamphlet to which so much reference  has  been\r\n\r\nmade, we read the following two sentences:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Labour Front's Policy on education is free\r\n\r\ncompulsory schooling for all children, in English  or\r\n\r\nvernacular  schools, for the first  six  years  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter of first priority. Thereafter scholarships  or\r\n\r\ngrants may be provided in deserving cases.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all. The only merit in the Government's new\r\n\r\nproposals  is  that three sentences  have  taken  the\r\n\r\nplace of two, but nevertheless they do not make us 50\r\n\r\nper  cent  the wiser and certainly have  neither  the\r\n\r\nsweep  nor the comprehension of the Progressive Party\r\n\r\nproposals  in  our programme. I wish  to  examine  it\r\n\r\nsentence by sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first states that \"the policy of the Government\r\n\r\nis  to aim at equal treatment for all schools and all\r\n\r\nteachers  in those schools\". As the Member for  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru  (Mr William Tan) has already said,  obviously\r\n\r\nwe  require clarification of this statement before we\r\n\r\ncan  accept  it  as  more than justifying  its  high-sounding  phrase.  Does it mean that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  give  equal grants-in-aid to all  the  schools,\r\n\r\nwhich  we  will welcome, or that it will  bear  equal\r\n\r\nexpenditure  per pupil in all schools? Does  it  mean\r\n\r\nthat   there   would  be  equal  salary  scales   and\r\n\r\nallowances  to  married teachers as to single,  women\r\n\r\nteachers  as  to  men, English teachers  in  Chinese,\r\n\r\nTamil  and  Malay  schools as in  Government  English\r\n\r\nschools?  No  doubt the Minister for  Education  will\r\n\r\nenlighten  us  on his plans before the  end  of  this\r\n\r\ndebate.  But  I would like to bring to his  attention\r\n\r\none of the many inequalities which undoubtedly exist.\r\n\r\nI   refer   to  the  disparity  between  the  special\r\n\r\nallowances  granted  to married and  to  single  lady\r\n\r\nteachers.  It is the present practice for  principals\r\n\r\nand  specialists, that is teachers, teaching  special\r\n\r\nsubjects, to receive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecial  allowances; but whereas unmarried women  get\r\n\r\nthe  full allowance, married women get only half  the\r\n\r\nallowance.  I  can  see  no  valid  reason  why,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  a  principal who is married and having  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  running a  girls'  school  should\r\n\r\nreceive  half  the allowance payable to an  unmarried\r\n\r\nprincipal.  I  hope that the Minister  for  Education\r\n\r\nwill  look into this matter at an early date, for  if\r\n\r\nit is the type of inequality which the Government has\r\n\r\nin  mind  to  remove, it will have our  whole-hearted\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now go on to the second sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"The  foundation stone of the policy will be  a  six-year  course  of  free  primary  education  for   all\r\n\r\nchildren.\" The Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan\r\n\r\nYew) has already remarked that the phrase \"compulsory\r\n\r\nschooling  for  all children\" which  appears  in  the\r\n\r\nLabour   Front's   platform  has  been   conveniently\r\n\r\ndropped.  The  elementary principle that  you  cannot\r\n\r\nhave  compulsory  education unless there  are  enough\r\n\r\nschools  for all children of school age,  appears  to\r\n\r\nhave  been  learnt very quickly after the elections,\r\n\r\nand  surely  there is a difference between  education\r\n\r\nfor all children and compulsory education. The former\r\n\r\nimplies education for all children who wish to  avail\r\n\r\nthemselves  of  going to school. The  latter  implies\r\n\r\nlegislation compelling parents to send their children\r\n\r\nto    school.    And   so   this   statement    fails\r\n\r\ndisappointingly   short  of  the  Progressive   Party\r\n\r\nprogramme  by  failing to state that  education  will\r\n\r\nstart  from the age of six. It has been a  matter  of\r\n\r\nregret  that the age of admission to primary  schools\r\n\r\nin the previous Government has been tending to change\r\n\r\nfrom  six years to seven years, and indeed  it  is  a\r\n\r\nfact  that  even  children of seven years  have  been\r\n\r\nunable  to gain admission. One would have hoped  that\r\n\r\none  of  the  earliest acts of the present Government\r\n\r\nwould  be  to give an assurance that they  will  take\r\n\r\nearly steps to banish this tendency, and I hope that\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Education will give us an assurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from technical education, which I will deal\r\n\r\nwith  in a moment, the Government statement,  as  did\r\n\r\nits election programme, now falls into ominous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsilence. One of the biggest problems is how to bridge\r\n\r\nthe  gap  between the age of 12 at  the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nprimary stage and the age of 14, the earliest age  at\r\n\r\nwhich  young  persons are allowed to work  under  the\r\n\r\nLabour Ordinance as it stands today and I hope as  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  proposed in future. Education clearly  must\r\n\r\nnot  stop at the six-year course unless a student  is\r\n\r\nfound to be absolutely unfit to continue his studies.\r\n\r\nThe  Progressive  Party policy is quite  definite  on\r\n\r\nthis  point.  The  poor bright  boys  must  have  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of secondary education for two years, or  two\r\n\r\nyears trade and junior technical education free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This takes us on to secondary education as a whole,\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government statement fails to mention  at\r\n\r\nall.   We  agree  that  primary  education   is   the\r\n\r\nfoundation,  but  it is like putting  your  essential\r\n\r\npiling  in below ground. You get nothing to show  for\r\n\r\nyour money till the real structure above ground, from\r\n\r\nthe  age  of  12,  starts appearing.  If  we  are  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to provide the country with local  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  who can take control of the higher grades  not\r\n\r\nonly  of the public service but also of all the other\r\n\r\nspheres  of  life  in  the  country,  then  secondary\r\n\r\neducation must not be neglected in the way  in  which\r\n\r\nthe  Government  intends  to  do,  as  shown  in  the\r\n\r\nstatement  of  policy.  Indeed,  the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government was to build one  secondary  for\r\n\r\nevery  five  or six primary schools, and  this  still\r\n\r\nstands,  unfortunately, today.  Does  the  Government\r\n\r\nthink this is enough, or will it improve the ratio as\r\n\r\nit  must if it is to turn out a sufficient number  of\r\n\r\nwell-educated young men and women fit to serve  their\r\n\r\ncountry,  and  if it is to find sufficient  competent\r\n\r\nteachers  to  man  the schools, one of  the  greatest\r\n\r\nproblems of all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pass now to the final sentence of the Government\r\n\r\nstatement: \"Technical education. . . will be expanded\r\n\r\nas   rapidly   as  possible  and  the   question   of\r\n\r\napprenticeship and training of industrial workers and\r\n\r\nclerks   will   be   studied  at  an   early   date.\"\r\n\r\nApprenticeship and training of industrial workers  is\r\n\r\nof  course  of  paramount importance and  is  already\r\n\r\nbeing  tackled.  The first task is to  attract  young\r\n\r\npeople  into  trades, and surely a Labour  Government\r\n\r\nworthy of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nname  should  be best fitted for this.  The  test  is\r\n\r\nclose  at  hand. I would draw attention to  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat during the current week enrolment in the evening\r\n\r\nclasses  in  16  subjects has started in  the  Junior\r\n\r\nTechnical  School, which starts its school year  next\r\n\r\nweek.  Can we be sure that all these 16 classes  will\r\n\r\nbe filled up? If they are, then a big hurdle has been\r\n\r\ncleared  and  all we have to do is to double,  triple\r\n\r\nand quadruple these as soon as possible. If not, what\r\n\r\nsteps  will  the  Minister  take  in  this  important\r\n\r\nmatter? But while technical training at this level is\r\n\r\nessential for economic development, as my hon. Friend\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Serangoon has himself said, we  would\r\n\r\nhave  expected the Government statement  to  make  at\r\n\r\nleast  a  passing  reference to new schemes  for  the\r\n\r\ntraining of professional men to take the place of the\r\n\r\ntechnical experts who, under the new policy, will  no\r\n\r\nlonger  be recruited from overseas. There is  a  wide\r\n\r\ngap between the declared policy of stopping overseas\r\n\r\nrecruitment and the practical aspects of it. I am not\r\n\r\nsuggesting that the policy is a wrong one but  it  is\r\n\r\ncommon  sense,  having stated a  policy,  to  suggest\r\n\r\nremedies for the problems arising from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving aside today university education which is\r\n\r\nnot,  after  all,  under the direct  control  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I  can only sum up by  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  statement is extremely disappointing  and\r\n\r\ncertainly  not very ambitious and does not appear  to\r\n\r\nhave  taken into consideration the careful  balancing\r\n\r\nrequired between the different stages of education if\r\n\r\nthe  greatest good of the greatest number of students\r\n\r\nis  to be brought about. The present is an indication\r\n\r\nthat the Government will devote its main attention to\r\n\r\n100 per cent attendance at primary schools only. Such\r\n\r\na  bottom-heavy  policy, if  I  may  be  allowed  the\r\n\r\nexpression,  would  be disastrous,  would  be  deeply\r\n\r\nresented by the people, and would be strongly opposed\r\n\r\nby  the  Progressive Party. Large reserves  of  money\r\n\r\nhave  been  built  up  in  the  last  few  years  for\r\n\r\nexpansion  of  education which the new Government  is\r\n\r\nvery  fortunate indeed to have inherited. It  is  our\r\n\r\nduty, as Members of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition,  not only to  see  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nsquandered but that it is wisely spent to benefit all\r\n\r\nstages of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to an examination of the Government\r\n\r\nproposals  regarding the medical services  which  are\r\n\r\nalso  treated  in  three short sentences.  There  is\r\n\r\nnothing  new  in  the plan for expansion  of  medical\r\n\r\nservices in the rural areas and the establishment  of\r\n\r\ndistrict  hospitals and clinics. Nobody  can  quarrel\r\n\r\nwith  that,  but what I find disturbing is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment appears - I may be wrong - to be modifying and\r\n\r\nreducing  the  Medical Plan already approved  and  in\r\n\r\npart  implemented, and has not gone  as  far  as  the\r\n\r\nProgressive Party programme. The plan of the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  to provide ten cottage  or  district\r\n\r\nhospitals,  five on the outskirts of the  urban  area\r\n\r\nand  five in the rural area, one of each being  under\r\n\r\ncontemplation   in   1955,   perhaps   still    under\r\n\r\ncontemplation,  and  we  presume  that  the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment has taken over the scheme lock, stock  and\r\n\r\nbarrel.  But  what  we  look  for  in  vain  is   any\r\n\r\nindication  that  there will  be  a  policy  of  real\r\n\r\ndecentralisation  of the medical  services,  although\r\n\r\nthis was categorically promised in the Labour Front's\r\n\r\nFour-year  Programme. Everybody knows that  too  much\r\n\r\nhas  been concentrated in the General Hospital  area.\r\n\r\nThat is why the Progressive Party, unlike the present\r\n\r\nGovernment, has advocated the building at once of one\r\n\r\ndistrict General Hospital with as many divisions  for\r\n\r\ndiagnosis  and  treatment as  exist  in  the  General\r\n\r\nHospital,  and that this hospital should be  situated\r\n\r\nsomewhere in the Katong-Geylang area where  there  is\r\n\r\nconcentrated  the largest suburban population.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  medical facilities it would offer  to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  it  would give a chance to our  young  local\r\n\r\ndoctors  to climb the tree more quickly to specialist\r\n\r\nposts and provide the necessary encouragement to  the\r\n\r\nmuch  needed recruitment of more of such  doctors  to\r\n\r\nGovernment service. We would like to see an immediate\r\n\r\nstep taken to put a stop to any further expansion  of\r\n\r\nthe  medical  services in the General  Hospital  area\r\n\r\nexcept  what is absolutely essential so that  a  very\r\n\r\nearly start can be made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin decentralisation. We therefore view the Government\r\n\r\nstatement with misgivings, as unrealistic and falling\r\n\r\nshort of their promises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the setting up of a Medical Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil,  while  this  may be an  admirable  move  in\r\n\r\ntheory,  we  hope that in practice it will  not  mean\r\n\r\nmore talk, more memoranda and less action on the main\r\n\r\nprinciples of development of the medical services. We\r\n\r\nhope indeed that it will put first things first,  and\r\n\r\nthe  consideration  of  the National  Health  Service\r\n\r\nScheme second. This scheme is also vague, and  I  had\r\n\r\nhopes  that the Minister for Health, who has  already\r\n\r\nspoken, would have elaborated on this point.  Is  the\r\n\r\nNational  Health Service to be contributory - that  is,\r\n\r\nwill people pay for it out of their weekly or monthly\r\n\r\nsalaries?   If  so,  is  Government  under-estimating\r\n\r\npublic resistance in such matters? If not, then it is\r\n\r\nno different from the present system and is merely  a\r\n\r\npiece  of  Labour  Front bluff. The  present  medical\r\n\r\nservices  are  free today, right up to and  including\r\n\r\noperations by the leading specialists, to  those  who\r\n\r\ncannot afford to pay. If it is intended to draft  all\r\n\r\nprivate practitioners into a state service, then  the\r\n\r\nfirst  task of the Government is to tackle  the  main\r\n\r\nproblem  of which no mention has been made, that  is,\r\n\r\nfor  the provision of more doctors. I believe that  I\r\n\r\nam  correct in saying that there are at present  only\r\n\r\n450 doctors in Singapore, 55 per cent of whom are  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  service  and  45  per  cent  in   private\r\n\r\npractice, representing roughly one for 2,667 persons,\r\n\r\nas  against  one for 1,100 in the United Kingdom.  At\r\n\r\nthis moment there are many vacancies unfilled in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  medical services. Whether the  number  is\r\n\r\nabout  30 or very much more, I must confess I am  not\r\n\r\ncertain.  The average total output of the Faculty  of\r\n\r\nMedicine  is  about 60 per year, of which  one  would\r\n\r\nexpect  two-thirds  to go to the Federation  and  the\r\n\r\nbalance  of  20  to Singapore, though I  believe  the\r\n\r\nratio is rather more in favour of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would further emphasise two points. The present\r\n\r\nGovernment's   intention  is   to   stop   expatriate\r\n\r\nrecruitment. It puts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  end  to help from overseas, which means  that  we\r\n\r\nshall have to fall back on our own limited resources,\r\n\r\nwhile  the  proposed union with the  Federation  will\r\n\r\npresumably make matters worse, as across the Causeway\r\n\r\nthere is one doctor to every 9,000 of the population.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that we shall need to do an immense drive\r\n\r\nto  find  sufficient doctors to man the new  district\r\n\r\nhospitals to maintain even the present ratio  of  one\r\n\r\nto 2,667 of a rapidly increasing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Health Service Scheme seems to us an\r\n\r\nempty  catch  phrase, either for something  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  already expanded or are in agreement to expand,\r\n\r\nor,  if the people have to contribute towards it, for\r\n\r\na   new   form  of  taxation  which  will  be  highly\r\n\r\nunpopular. We hope therefore that the Government will\r\n\r\nbe  able to give us a more reassuring picture of  its\r\n\r\nintentions than we have been able to gather from  its\r\n\r\nstatement of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not dwell long, Sir, on the subject of\r\n\r\npublic  transport, which has already been dealt  with\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan  Yew),\r\n\r\nand  I hope he will not be horrified to learn that  I\r\n\r\nam  in  agreement  with what he  said.  At  least  we\r\n\r\nhave - [Interruption.] I must, however, correct him  on\r\n\r\none  point.  Last  year the City Council - Progressives\r\n\r\nand  all - unanimously recommended the setting up of  a\r\n\r\npublic transport board to run the transport services,\r\n\r\nin  other words, to nationalise transport, and it was\r\n\r\nthe professional administrators who turned this down.\r\n\r\nWe  therefore also want to know - and the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Works was not very enlightening in\r\n\r\nhis  reply - what  are  to  be  the  functions  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed  transport authority. Is it merely  to  take\r\n\r\nover  those  duties  performed by the  City  Council,\r\n\r\nwhich is the present transport authority? If so, then\r\n\r\nit is a change only in form and not in substance, for\r\n\r\nit  will mean that the Singapore Traction Company and\r\n\r\nall   the   other  private  enterprises   now   given\r\n\r\nmonopolies  to  run  a  very essential  service  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  enjoy their monopolies, at least  until\r\n\r\n\"the time is ripe\", whenever that may be. A very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsurprising  policy  for  a  Socialist  Government  to\r\n\r\nadopt, and all the more surprising when the policy of\r\n\r\nnationalisation was an election pledge. The  question\r\n\r\nis therefore a simple one. Is the Government going to\r\n\r\nimplement its election pledge or is it not? If it  is\r\n\r\nnot,  then the public of Singapore is going  to  have\r\n\r\ntransport run by private companies for another  seven\r\n\r\nyears, from roughly the end of this year until 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next matter on which I wish to touch is the\r\n\r\nBanishment   Ordinance.  If  there  is   to   be   an\r\n\r\nexamination of the Emergency Regulations, it is quite\r\n\r\nclear  that  a similar examination of the  Banishment\r\n\r\nOrdinance  is in order, and we welcome  it.  In  this\r\n\r\nconnection  I would draw the attention of  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister - or should it be the Chief Secretary? - to one\r\n\r\npoint.  At  the  moment, persons born  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nMalacca  or Penang cannot be banished, while  persons\r\n\r\nborn  in other parts of the Federation, although they\r\n\r\nmay  be  resident  in Singapore, and  indeed  on  the\r\n\r\nelectoral register, can be banished. This seems to me\r\n\r\nillogical  at any time, but even more so  today  when\r\n\r\nthe  Government is contemplating early union with the\r\n\r\nFederation.  I  seek  an  assurance  that,   as   the\r\n\r\nBanishment Ordinance is to be reviewed, all cases  of\r\n\r\npersons  due to be banished shall be stayed forthwith\r\n\r\nand reviewed individually. It would clearly be unjust\r\n\r\nto  banish a man now for reasons which may be revoked\r\n\r\nin  a  month or two. I hope that the Government  will\r\n\r\ngive this assurance before the close of this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more matter and I have done. I wish to refer to\r\n\r\nwhat  I  consider  another serious  omission  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  statement, namely the action proposed  to\r\n\r\nbe  taken to put an end as far as possible to serious\r\n\r\nflooding. I have no doubt that other hon. Members are\r\n\r\ninterested  in  this matter, but none  more  than  I\r\n\r\nmyself  as  Member for the constituency  of  Tanglin.\r\n\r\nHon.  Members  may  have  different  opinions  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether the floods are the more serious in the Bedok,\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai, Whampoa, or Bukit Timah area,  but  I\r\n\r\nmust  bring to the attention of Government  that  the\r\n\r\npresent extensive building programme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the Bukit Timah  area  is  producing\r\n\r\nconditions whereby after any very severe storm of  no\r\n\r\nmore  than one hour's duration, the Bukit Timah canal\r\n\r\nis  liable to overflow its banks to produce hardship,\r\n\r\nsuffering and considerable inconvenience. That  is  a\r\n\r\nvery serious position. However, I am glad to say that\r\n\r\nfrom  my own observations and from what I learn  from\r\n\r\nthe  villagers themselves, the new Ulu  Pandan  pilot\r\n\r\nscheme, which strangely enough lies for the most part\r\n\r\nwithin  the  Tanglin  constituency,  seems  to  be  a\r\n\r\nsuccess.  The pilot canal is taking water away  in  a\r\n\r\nwesterly  direction towards the Ulu Pandan River  and\r\n\r\nhas  put  an end to serious flooding in the immediate\r\n\r\narea.  The way therefore seems to be clear to  tackle\r\n\r\nthe major scheme - admittedly a gigantic one - of taking\r\n\r\nthe waters of the Bukit Timah-Alexandra area away  to\r\n\r\nthe  sea  and  away from the city. I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will not fail to tackle this  problem  as\r\n\r\nurgently and energetically as they have undertaken to\r\n\r\ntackle other problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

His Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  naturally  did not touch  on  independence.\r\n\r\nWhen  our Chief Minister stated that we were to  have\r\n\r\nself-government  within four years  and  independence\r\n\r\nafterwards, I was rather very much amused.  Why  wait\r\n\r\nfor  four  years when the surrounding  countries  are\r\n\r\nquite free? We are working this constitution. Why not\r\n\r\ndemand  now;  within  six months  self-government  at\r\n\r\nleast;   and   why  wait  for  the  Federation?   The\r\n\r\nFederation has got its own problems, the Sultans  and\r\n\r\ntheir subjects. There are the British territories  of\r\n\r\nPenang  and  Malacca. On the other hand,  this  is  a\r\n\r\nBritish   colony.   We   can   demand   freedom    or\r\n\r\nindependence, and if we are free we can also free our\r\n\r\nneighbour. I think my British friends will forgive me\r\n\r\nand  blame  the Chief Minister for bringing  up  this\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, His Excellency the Governor's assurance\r\n\r\nthat  no expatriate will be employed unless with  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  the  Ministries  or  members  of   his\r\n\r\nMinistries - I do not think I am satisfied  with  this.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  has  been said that it was the  Progressive\r\n\r\nParty  who was responsible for this motion,  and  the\r\n\r\nProgressives took the blame for being rather slow  in\r\n\r\nits implementation. Sir, this was my motion moved  on\r\n\r\nthe  18th  of  November, 1952, that there  should  be\r\n\r\nMalayanisation. A committee was appointed, and  their\r\n\r\nreport appeared sometime in 1954. Well, there will be\r\n\r\nsome  questions  by me, that is, when  I  moved  this\r\n\r\nmotion in 1952, between that period and the period of\r\n\r\nthe report, how\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch  hurry was made to get expatriates appointed.  I\r\n\r\nwill  make  this  subject my  next  question  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Not only that, Sir, but after  the  report\r\n\r\nwas  published,  how many more were appointed  before\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  came  into being.  It  will  be  very\r\n\r\ninteresting to know if there are very few posts  left\r\n\r\nfor  further  appointments for  the  local-born,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  we  will have to pay a very high  price  for\r\n\r\nabolition terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad it is realised that Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy  depends  on  its entrepot  trade.  Also  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the Governor and the Chief Minister  have\r\n\r\nmade  remarks  that various services  should  expand.\r\n\r\nWell,  that was nothing new. During these last  seven\r\n\r\nyears  the  Legislative Council, then  existent,  had\r\n\r\npassed  so many welfare measures - medical, education,\r\n\r\nsocial and others. Our income is limited. We have got\r\n\r\nno  natural resources of our own, none whatsoever. We\r\n\r\nonly depend on the entrepot trade, but that trade  is\r\n\r\nmostly  with  Indonesia, and Indonesia is  also  very\r\n\r\nconscious  of  this trade passing through  Singapore;\r\n\r\nand  naturally  every country will try  for  its  own\r\n\r\nbetterment.  Then,  Sir, where is the  income  coming\r\n\r\nfrom?  We  have  got  only limited resources.  Higher\r\n\r\ntaxation? Well, you will drive away foreign  capital.\r\n\r\nWhat is the other alternative? I might try to suggest\r\n\r\none or two for the benefit of the present Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1952, the Government, in reply to my\r\n\r\nquestions  in  the  Legislative Council,  said,  \"The\r\n\r\namount  of hard currency earned by Malaya as a  whole\r\n\r\nwas $377 millions, and for Singapore $50 millions.\" I\r\n\r\nhave  questions for this Assembly to which I hope  to\r\n\r\nget  replies, possibly on the 24th of May. Now,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  hard  currency belongs to us. This is  our  own\r\n\r\nearning. It should be retained for the benefit of the\r\n\r\npeople.  The gold dollars if we have with us  we  can\r\n\r\nutilise in many ways. We can import goods which  will\r\n\r\nbring down the cost of consumer goods. That means the\r\n\r\nmasses  will  have to pay less. Their spending  power\r\n\r\nwill  increase. But what is happening up to now?  Our\r\n\r\nhard-earned currency is given to the United\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKingdom,  I  do not know on what terms. I am  waiting\r\n\r\nfor  the  answer, out whatever the answer may  be,  I\r\n\r\nwill  move  that  this  should be  retained  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of this country and should not be handed over\r\n\r\nto anyone, unless on certain terms. We can utilise it\r\n\r\nto  our  best  advantage. But  today,  Sir,  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening?  We are getting consumer goods  from  hard\r\n\r\ncurrency  areas,  from Hongkong. Malaya  has  to  pay\r\n\r\nblack-market  rates for our own consumer  goods.  Our\r\n\r\nmasses pay higher rates. Why cannot it be utilised by\r\n\r\nimporting direct, and utilise these gold dollars  for\r\n\r\nourselves? That is one way of saving, which is  quite\r\n\r\na lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing is income tax. I think this\r\n\r\nDepartment must be tightened so that the evaders  may\r\n\r\nbe  brought  to book and we can get more  money  from\r\n\r\nthem.  If  you think of higher income tax, well,  you\r\n\r\nhave got to look at the Colony of Hongkong. They  are\r\n\r\npaying  much  less than what we are  paying.  In  any\r\n\r\ncase,  I hope the Government will be very careful  to\r\n\r\nfind  the  money and use means which will  not  drive\r\n\r\naway trade from Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one more remark. I think it was the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  who said about the Progressive Party,  that\r\n\r\nthey  did not do this and they did not do that.  But,\r\n\r\nSir,   in  the  Legislative  Council  there  was   no\r\n\r\nunofficial  elected majority at all.  The  Government\r\n\r\nused  its official votes or the nominated votes. What\r\n\r\nis  happening today in this Legislative Assembly? You\r\n\r\nhave  got  four Nominated Members and three  Official\r\n\r\nMinisters, and today the Government is doing the same\r\n\r\nthing. This is an evil, and this evil must be removed\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was rather amused when the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nyesterday, Sir, spoke about the coolie. I  think  the\r\n\r\nbetter  term used today is \"labourer\", not  \"coolie\".\r\n\r\nThe  labourers are insulted: but it was rather an old\r\n\r\nterm  to  use.  Then  he was rather  unhappy  that  a\r\n\r\nlabourer earned only $31. Well, I will take  this  up\r\n\r\nwhen  he  gets through the next motion, his  princely\r\n\r\nsalary:  How  much is he going to cut from  that  and\r\n\r\nhand it over to those labourers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last thing I want to say is that it is very\r\n\r\nundemocratic  to  have a ban on public  meetings.  It\r\n\r\nshould be removed immediately. That is common law. If\r\n\r\nanyone  were to say anything which is seditious,  the\r\n\r\nlaw  could take its own course. But I say this,  that\r\n\r\nit  is  very  undemocratic. The ban must  be  removed\r\n\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have listened\r\n\r\nwith  much  delight to the speech of the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  (Mr John Ede). He seems to be also a convert\r\n\r\nto Socialism. His speech was not only delightful, but\r\n\r\nalso amusing, and amusing indeed when he accused,  in\r\n\r\nanticipation, that the Government might  not  go  far\r\n\r\nenough   to  cover  even  the  programme  which   the\r\n\r\nProgressives had in anticipation also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, Sir, that there is at present free medical\r\n\r\ntreatment. That is so on paper; that is so to a  very\r\n\r\nsmall body of the poor people. A single visit by  him\r\n\r\nto  the General Hospital Outpatient Department or  to\r\n\r\nthe   Kandang  Kerbau  Maternity  Hospital  will   be\r\n\r\nsufficient  to convince him that the poor  have  very\r\n\r\nlittle  chance of free treatment. The queue seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  an endless one. A poor person is lucky if he gets\r\n\r\nattendance at one of these hospitals if he called  at\r\n\r\nten o'clock, and by four o'clock he has been attended\r\n\r\nto.  It  is  the policy of this Government to  remedy\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been wondered, Sir, why the word \"compulsory\"\r\n\r\nwas  left out in His Excellency's speech when applied\r\n\r\nto  education.  It is not yet time to make  education\r\n\r\ncompulsory  because the schools and the teachers  are\r\n\r\nnot yet ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Why put it in the programme?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Our programme  is  a  four-year programme,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  at the moment we realize that if we were to make\r\n\r\nfree education compulsory, that legislation will come\r\n\r\nto  nothing and will cause hardship and embarrassment\r\n\r\nto  us.  Now that part of the programme of  the  last\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Sir, which falls within the provision  of\r\n\r\nour   objects   and  our  four-year  programme   will\r\n\r\ncertainly  be carried out, and I give that  assurance\r\n\r\nto the Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, I had the privilege of hearing very\r\n\r\nlong  and  interesting speeches  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  (Mr Lee Kuan Yew). So  much  of  his\r\n\r\nspeech  that has not displeased me I must say I  have\r\n\r\nenjoyed. In fact, I must say that I did enjoy a large\r\n\r\nportion of his speech to such an extent that I  began\r\n\r\nto  wonder and wondered why in this modern  world  of\r\n\r\nours, ghosts still exist. It seems that the ghost  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government has turned itself into  an  excellent\r\n\r\nsolicitor,  giving the Member for Tanjong Pagar  such\r\n\r\nan  excellent brief that he was able to put in  words\r\n\r\nwhat the Government has in mind and under its serious\r\n\r\nconsideration.  For that, Sir, we  must  express  our\r\n\r\ngratitude to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take one example of his speech, that\r\n\r\nis,  his  remarks relating to Malayanisation  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic Service. His remarks had pleased me except  to\r\n\r\nthis  extent:  because we, the Government,  feel  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  honour its  obligations,  legal  or\r\n\r\notherwise;   when   an  overseas  employee   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been  found  to  be  redundant,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must provide sufficient compensation  for\r\n\r\nthe earlier termination of his service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of the National Service Ordinance, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has under its consideration this Ordinance\r\n\r\nwith  a  view  to introducing appropriate amendments,\r\n\r\nbut   while  we  are  expecting  self-government  and\r\n\r\nindependence  round  the  corner,  we  must   prepare\r\n\r\nourselves  for that self-government and independence,\r\n\r\nand  before  it comes, it may be well that  we  train\r\n\r\nourselves sufficiently well enough to be able to look\r\n\r\nafter ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard also, Sir, the interesting speech of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck),  who\r\n\r\nsaid that he is a businessman and as a businessman he\r\n\r\ncannot appreciate how the Government could lend money\r\n\r\nwithout   interest.  Government,  Sir,   is   not   a\r\n\r\nbusinessman and should not try to be one.  Government\r\n\r\ncan venture to help those who are in need without any\r\n\r\nidea  of  making  profits, and that is  the  definite\r\n\r\npolicy  of  this  Government when it declares  itself\r\n\r\nready  to  lend money without interest to those  poor\r\n\r\npeople who want to buy a house for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Paya Lebar had allowed himself the\r\n\r\nopportunity of enjoying one of the speeches at  least\r\n\r\nof the Chief Minister under what they call the \"apple\r\n\r\ntree\" - I should call it a \"durian tree\" - he would  have\r\n\r\nheard that the Chief Minister declare under that tree\r\n\r\nthat  the  Labour Front does not intend to  kill  the\r\n\r\ngoose  that lays the golden eggs. In fact, the Labour\r\n\r\nFront  wishes  to feed that goose with  new  capital,\r\n\r\nwith new industry and such other nourishment, so that\r\n\r\nthe  goose  may be able to lay more golden eggs,  not\r\n\r\nonly  for  that goose but for all those  who  are  in\r\n\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong),\r\n\r\nSir,  also  appears  to  have gained  some  Socialist\r\n\r\nideas.  He  appears to be interested in Boys'  Clubs,\r\n\r\nbut he made this statement which is not correct, that\r\n\r\nall  Boys' Clubs in Singapore are being supported and\r\n\r\nrun  by  private organisations. More Boys' Clubs  are\r\n\r\nbeing  run by the Social Welfare Department, and  the\r\n\r\nBoys'   Clubs   that  are  being   run   by   private\r\n\r\norganisations have received financial and other  help\r\n\r\nfrom  the Social Welfare Department. He wants  credit\r\n\r\nto  be  given  where  credit is due.  From  the  last\r\n\r\nGovernment we received a legacy of a reserve fund  of\r\n\r\nabout  a  hundred million dollars. I do not  like  to\r\n\r\ngive  credit,  Sir, to any government or  any  public\r\n\r\nbody for having a large reserve fund when the members\r\n\r\nof  that  public have so much to ask  for  and  their\r\n\r\nrequirements have not been attended to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully associate myself with all the\r\n\r\nobservations  on the Governor's speech  made  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some points in the Governor's speech that could be commended; there is also much to be said against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who has had close connection with employees\r\n\r\nof  the  Armed  Services, I have  this  to  say:  the\r\n\r\nlocally   enlisted  employees  of  the  three   Armed\r\n\r\nServices  in Singapore so far have not been bound  by\r\n\r\nthe labour and social legislation of this Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Naval Base Labour Union at one stage boycotted\r\n\r\nthe  election to the Legislative Council because  the\r\n\r\nworkers felt very strongly, and rightly too, that  as\r\n\r\nlong  as the Government of Singapore, no matter  what\r\n\r\nits  constitution might be, was powerless to  enforce\r\n\r\nlegislation in the Armed Services, so long  would  it\r\n\r\nbe  futile  for  the  workers to participate  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical life of this Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governor's speech alludes to the likelihood of\r\n\r\nagreement being reached with Her Majesty's Government\r\n\r\nthat  the  Labour  Bill  should  cover  all  civilian\r\n\r\nemployees  of  the three Armed Services recruited  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This  is  a very far  cry  from  what  we\r\n\r\nexpected  and wanted. What we seek and what  we  have\r\n\r\nevery right to have of any self-respecting government\r\n\r\nis  not  only the voluntary acceptance by  the  Armed\r\n\r\nServices,  but  what  we want  is  unconditional  and\r\n\r\nobligatory application by the Armed Services of  such\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are surprised that the new Government should\r\n\r\nappear   so  uninterested  in  asserting  legislative\r\n\r\nauthority throughout the territory of Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nlocally   enlisted  employees  of  the  three   Armed\r\n\r\nServices   in  Singapore  number  about  40,000   and\r\n\r\nconstitute  one-sixth of the total  labour  force  in\r\n\r\nthis  Colony. As far as the 40,000 locally  recruited\r\n\r\nServices employees are concerned, the right  to  vote\r\n\r\nand  to elect representatives to the Legislature will\r\n\r\nremain  a  barren  right while  that  Legislature  is\r\n\r\npowerless to better the workers'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworking  and  living conditions.  The  trappings  and\r\n\r\nparaphernalia of a democratic form of government  may\r\n\r\nbe  present, but unless that government has the power\r\n\r\nto improve the workers' working and living conditions\r\n\r\nwithout having to consult the Imperial Government,  I\r\n\r\nmaintain  that  that government is a  mockery  and  a\r\n\r\nsham.  It  is  to  be  hoped that the  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore will insist on unconditional and obligatory\r\n\r\nobservances  of all social and labour legislation  by\r\n\r\nthe  Armed  Services and not just plead for voluntary\r\n\r\nacceptance of such legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of trade unions, I am also\r\n\r\nparticularly concerned over the present labour unrest\r\n\r\nin  the  Colony. I take this opportunity of  thanking\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Labour and Welfare  in  trying  to\r\n\r\nsettle  all these labour disputes. The first  dispute\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister  has to deal with  has  been  the\r\n\r\ndispute in the Singapore Harbour Board. It is  to  be\r\n\r\nregretted,  however,  that the labour  situation  has\r\n\r\nreached  a  deadlock.  There is angry  discontentment\r\n\r\namong  the  workers of the Harbour Board;  so  it  is\r\n\r\namong the other workers of the Colony. Poor wages and\r\n\r\nobnoxious working conditions are obvious reasons  for\r\n\r\ndiscontentment.  Mismanagement  and  mishandling   of\r\n\r\npersonnel may also be another cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers have been exploited for much too long. I\r\n\r\ntherefore suggest that the present Legislature should\r\n\r\nlegislate  in the interest of workers. Any  tentative\r\n\r\nor  half-hearted approach to this issue will  be  not\r\n\r\nonly derogatory to the dignity of this Assembly,  but\r\n\r\nwould  also  constitute an insult to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Ching Siong (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Government, we have been told in the  Governor's\r\n\r\nspeech,  is  anxious  not to  damage  the  fabric  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  it  is therefore  going  to  ask  this\r\n\r\nAssembly   to   adopt  the  Governor's   Proclamation\r\n\r\nextending  the period of emergency for another  three\r\n\r\nmonths.

It is this thing that the people had in  mind\r\n\r\nabout the regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people ask for fundamental democratic rights,\r\n\r\nbut  what  have  they got? They  have  only  got  the\r\n\r\nfreedom to fire crackers after seven o'clock  in  the\r\n\r\nevening. The people ask for bread and they have  been\r\n\r\ngiven stones instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears from the Governor's speech that the\r\n\r\npresent  Government intends to continue with national\r\n\r\nservice,  but  the  elected  representatives  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  still no control over foreign  affairs.\r\n\r\nWhat  guarantee is there that our young men will  not\r\n\r\nbe  used  as  cannon fodder to fight  other  people's\r\n\r\nbattle  for  them?  Do the people  of  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaya  have  any  choice of their friends  or  their\r\n\r\nfoes?

I know that the\r\n\r\nGovernor's  speech  contains no  clear  statement  of\r\n\r\neducation  policy.  What is the  Government's  policy\r\n\r\ntowards  vernacular  education?  Do  we  accept   the\r\n\r\nprinciples  of  the United Nations Charter  that  the\r\n\r\nright  of every community to develop its own language\r\n\r\nand  culture must be respected, or we carry  on  with\r\n\r\nthe   present   policy   of  discriminating   against\r\n\r\nvernacular education? The present education policy is\r\n\r\na  colonial education policy. Therefore education  in\r\n\r\nthe mother tongues of the people is not respected and\r\n\r\nencouraged  by the Government. The present Government\r\n\r\nmust  replace its policy with a democratic  education\r\n\r\npolicy  which  will  respect and encourage  the  full\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the mother tongues  of  the  peoples\r\n\r\nwhich  are  Malay,  Chinese and Tamil.  The  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party will not accept an education policy  the\r\n\r\naim   of   which  is  to  produce  black  and  yellow\r\n\r\nEuropeans.  The  Governor's  speech  mentions   equal\r\n\r\ntreatment   for  all  schools.  Does   this   include\r\n\r\nfinancial provision for vernacular schools  equal  to\r\n\r\nthat  provided  for  English schools?  And  does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment intend to remove the conditional grants-in-aid for Chinese schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, what about equal treatment for teachers of\r\n\r\nvernacular  schools?  At  present  there  is  a   big\r\n\r\ndifference   between  English  school  teachers   and\r\n\r\nvernacular  school  teachers in  their  salaries  and\r\n\r\nconditions of service. This alone has proved  to  the\r\n\r\npeople that the Government does not want to encourage\r\n\r\nvernacular  education  and  is  only  interested   in\r\n\r\nencouraging   English  education.  If   the   present\r\n\r\nGovernment   wishes  to  prove   its   sincerity   to\r\n\r\nvernacular education in Singapore, it must give equal\r\n\r\ntreatment   to  teachers  of  English   schools   and\r\n\r\nvernacular schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government have all along been in complete control\r\n\r\nof  Malay education in Singapore; yet Malay education\r\n\r\nis  very backward in Singapore. Malay education  here\r\n\r\nstagnates  at the primary school level.  Why  has  it\r\n\r\nnever been developed, like English education,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  to  Senior Cambridge? Because the Government  has\r\n\r\nnever  been interested in encouraging the development\r\n\r\nof  the  Malay language and culture. I hope that  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government  will change its  policy  towards\r\n\r\nMalay  education  and  help  to  preserve  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  culture instead of killing  it.  After\r\n\r\nwhat  it  has done to Malay education, the Government\r\n\r\nnow  wants  to control Chinese education  completely.\r\n\r\nWhy   does  Government  want  complete  control  over\r\n\r\nChinese  schools?  Is it in order to  reduce  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation in Singapore to the same poor condition  as\r\n\r\nMalay   education?  Is  this  the  reason   why   the\r\n\r\nGovernment is trying to convert the Chinese  language\r\n\r\nin  Chinese schools into a second language? Under the\r\n\r\npresent  education policy there is every danger  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  wants to introduce  English  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  schools, not as a second language only,  but\r\n\r\nas  the  main  language.  We hope  that  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  try  and  remove  all  the  present\r\n\r\ndangers   to  vernacular  education  by  adopting   a\r\n\r\ndemocratic education policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade Unions. The Governor's speech promises that\r\n\r\nall   possible   assistance   will   be   given    to\r\n\r\nstrengthening the trade union movement. The  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party would like to ask how the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement   can   grow  strong  under  the   Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations.  The class of people who  have  suffered\r\n\r\nthe  most  under  the  Emergency Regulations  is  the\r\n\r\nworking  class.  The Emergency Regulations  hold  the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement by the throat. The working class\r\n\r\ncan  hardly  breathe. Under the Emergency Regulations\r\n\r\nthe real rulers of the people are the Special Branch.\r\n\r\nThe  workers  and trade unionists are threatened  and\r\n\r\nintimidated by police spies and informers, who try to\r\n\r\nwreck  working-class organizations from  within.  The\r\n\r\nfinal  weapon  of the desperate worker  living  under\r\n\r\nintolerable conditions is the strike weapon, but even\r\n\r\nthis  weapon  loses  its effect under  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations.   The  fourteen  days'   strike   notice\r\n\r\nrequired   under  the  Emergency  Regulations   gives\r\n\r\nemployers  plenty  of time to hire \"black  legs\"  and\r\n\r\nmake  other  arrangements to break  the  strike.  The\r\n\r\nemployers enjoy all the advantages under\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Emergency  Regulations because  these  laws  are\r\n\r\ndirected against the interests of the working  class.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Government  really wants to  strengthen  the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement, let it first of all repeal  the\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Provident Fund Ordinance. We are told\r\n\r\nthat  the  Central Provident Fund Ordinance is  under\r\n\r\nexamination with a view to further amendment. I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  is  aware  of  the  widespread\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction among workers against this Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThe wages of the workers today are already too low to\r\n\r\nmeet  the basic human needs of the workers and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.  The  bitter struggle  for  existence  will\r\n\r\nbecome harder for the majority of workers if they are\r\n\r\nforced  to contribute 5 per cent of their low  wages.\r\n\r\nThe  Government does not seem to be interested in the\r\n\r\npresent  insecurity of the workers. Strangely enough,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  pretends to  be  interested  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  security  of the workers, but  not  in  their\r\n\r\npresent  security. It is very difficult for a  worker\r\n\r\nto  make sense of the way in which the minds  of  the\r\n\r\nauthorities  work. First, let us improve the  present\r\n\r\nwhich  is hard enough for a worker. Then we can  take\r\n\r\ncare of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally the Governor's speech gives the illusion\r\n\r\nthat  the present Government is somehow fundamentally\r\n\r\ndifferent from the previous Government of the Colony.\r\n\r\nI  warn the elected Members of the Government not  to\r\n\r\nfall  victim to this illusion. They form  part  of  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  government, and the  real  rulers  are  not\r\n\r\npresent in this Assembly. They are thousands of miles\r\n\r\naway in the Colonial Office in London. If the elected\r\n\r\nMembers of the Government think that they can  reform\r\n\r\ncolonialism, they are sadly mistaken. They  might  be\r\n\r\nfools,  but  let  them remember that the  people  can\r\n\r\nnever be fooled. The People's Action Party says  that\r\n\r\nthere  never has been and never can be any substitute\r\n\r\nfor  full  democratic and complete independence.  The\r\n\r\npeople never say, \"Slow progress to self-government.\"\r\n\r\nThe people say, \"Merdeka!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of explanation.

Why is it  that\r\n\r\nwe  now  face  a  flood of complaints  that  teen-age\r\n\r\nchildren,  after  their primary  stage,  cannot  find\r\n\r\nadmission  to secondary schools? I need not  go  into\r\n\r\ndetails, but hon. Members will agree with me that the\r\n\r\ncause  of  these  complaints  is  the  fault  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious governments. I do not propose to gloss  over\r\n\r\nthe  fault  of  somebody else nor am I here  to  hide\r\n\r\nbehind  that cloak and do nothing about it. I  assure\r\n\r\nhon. Members that it is the policy of this Government\r\n\r\nto  do  all  it  can to speed up the construction  of\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools, provide more  places  in  schools\r\n\r\nthan has been possible hitherto, and to this end I am\r\n\r\nsure  I have my colleagues' support to put right what\r\n\r\nhas  been  wrong and to execute the policy  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen clearly stated in our programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to clarify one further point to which\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar and other Members  have\r\n\r\nreferred, and that is equal treatment for all schools\r\n\r\nand   teachers.  The  word  \"all\"  includes  English,\r\n\r\nChinese,  Malay and Indian schools and  teachers.  So\r\n\r\nour hon.

However, coupled to this sickness is the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  some of them are now vying with one another  to\r\n\r\nbring  out  points  which are  already  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  programme,  and  it  seems  to  be   very\r\n\r\nsuspicious  that  those who never  thought  of  these\r\n\r\nthings  before, and who would probably run away  from\r\n\r\nsuch  ideas, had they been mentioned, are now  coming\r\n\r\nup, advocating them. It is very evident to me, and  I\r\n\r\nthink  to  the general public whom they are  probably\r\n\r\ntrying  to impress through the Press, that  they  are\r\n\r\nhoping thereby to get a bit of cheap publicity and  a\r\n\r\nlittle credit for what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  fully well know the Government is going to  do,\r\n\r\nwhether they are with the Government or against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather curious that the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lim  Choon Mong) yesterday told  us  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  inherited a great deal  of  benefits\r\n\r\nfrom  the  last government, and today the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  (Mr  John Ede) tried to absolve  his  Party\r\n\r\nfrom the deeds, misdeeds and, what is more important,\r\n\r\nthe  lack of deeds of the past government by  telling\r\n\r\nus  that,  \"After all, we Progressives  were  in  the\r\n\r\nminority  anyhow.  What could we  do?\"  That  is  the\r\n\r\nProgressives all over. They want the credit, but they\r\n\r\ndare not take the blame. However, I suppose they  are\r\n\r\nout  to get a bit of credit, but however clever  they\r\n\r\nmay be, they cannot beat the Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\n(Mr Lee Kuan Yew) who is a past master at this game;\r\n\r\nit  seems, where if he fails to steal the credit,  he\r\n\r\nwill  try  to  steal  the  thunder  by  telling   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to go one step further, and this game  has\r\n\r\nproved  so  contagious  indeed  that  you  find  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  who would not have dared to have such  ideas\r\n\r\nnow  come  out  talking with great  gusto,  \"Why  not\r\n\r\nindependence tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Today, I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

However, the consolation  remains\r\n\r\nthat we may turn out good actors and they would be an\r\n\r\nadded  asset to the wealth of this country, for which\r\n\r\nI am sure the Labour Government would be grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming down to brass tacks, Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim) lamented the fact\r\n\r\nthis   morning  that  the  Government  has  made   no\r\n\r\nprovision  to  exercise control  over  the  terms  of\r\n\r\nservice  of  the  civilian  employees  of  the  three\r\n\r\nServices.

A\r\n\r\nproblem for farmers in the rural areas is the absence\r\n\r\nof  veterinary centres in these areas to  which  they\r\n\r\ncan  bring their poultry for inoculation. At  present\r\n\r\nthe   representative  of  the  Veterinary  Department\r\n\r\nvisits  the  farms  occasionally  to  inoculate   the\r\n\r\npoultry.  But this, I submit, is not enough  and  can\r\n\r\nnever compensate for the absence of such centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rural areas are very poorly supplied with water\r\n\r\nand  electricity and in a period of drought as  that\r\n\r\nat  present prevailing the absence of water in  their\r\n\r\nwells causes the farmers a lot of hardship. I do hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government will set up  the  provision  of\r\n\r\nwater and, electricity in these areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of fishermen living in these areas\r\n\r\nand up to date nothing has been done to introduce co-operative marketing schemes for them. I hope that the\r\n\r\npresent  Government will give this matter the highest\r\n\r\npriority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rural areas communications are very poor and\r\n\r\nin  my  division alone, which covers more than twelve\r\n\r\nsquare miles with a well distributed population,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  is only one public telephone at Ponggol Point.\r\n\r\nI hope that the Minister for Communications and Works\r\n\r\nwill look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than fifty per cent of the dwellings of farmers\r\n\r\nin  my  division are not numbered, and these  farmers\r\n\r\ntold  me  that they were very unhappy about it.

Member: Liberal?] because\r\n\r\nI  feel that the wording of the policy statement  has\r\n\r\nbeen  so very carefully drafted that Socialists  like\r\n\r\nmyself  will not be able to attack it very seriously.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  I would like to bring  forward  a  few\r\n\r\npoints  for the improvement of the policy  which  the\r\n\r\nLiberal Government, if it cares to, can accept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and foremost point, Sir, is the union of\r\n\r\nSingapore  with  the Federation  of  Malaya  and  the\r\n\r\nultimate  self-government of the territory.  So  much\r\n\r\nhas  been  said, but all the speakers, I think,  have\r\n\r\nforgotten to mention one important factor,  and  that\r\n\r\nis  the  creation  of  a common citizenship  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore.  I\r\n\r\ndo not know whether they believe that a nation can be\r\n\r\ncreated  without a common citizenship or  whether  in\r\n\r\nthe  near  future they will consider this aspect  and\r\n\r\nbring it to the notice of this Assembly. In the  last\r\n\r\nCouncil I very vehemently suggested the creation of a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship. I did not get any support  at\r\n\r\nall  because  I  was  told that there  were  so  many\r\n\r\ndifficulties which confronted the government at  that\r\n\r\ntime. The position in Singapore today is that we have\r\n\r\nsome people as aliens, some as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlocal-born British subjects, and some as citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom and Colonies. No mention has been\r\n\r\nmade  by  the Government as to whether they would  or\r\n\r\nwould  not  create a common citizenship in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture.   However,  I  take  it  that   the   Liberal\r\n\r\nGovernment would endeavour -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S.

Carry on, Mr Nair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> As I was saying, I take it they would try\r\n\r\nto  implement  item 9 of the Labour Front  programme,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the creation of a Singapore citizenship,  at\r\n\r\nthe earliest possible date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the aliens have been denied the privilege of\r\n\r\nvoting.  Many  of the citizens of the United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nand  Colonies  have  been  denied  the  privilege  of\r\n\r\nenjoying  the  citizenship right. Not  long  ago  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  asked  all the Commonwealth  citizens  to\r\n\r\nregister themselves as citizens of the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nand  Colonies, and when I raised the question of what\r\n\r\nprivileges  they were entitled to, I  was  told  that\r\n\r\nthey  could only be regarded as second-rate  citizens\r\n\r\nof Singapore. All the jobs advertised stipulated that\r\n\r\nthe  applicant should either be born in Singapore  or\r\n\r\nshould have a residential qualification of ten years.\r\n\r\nNo  mention whatsoever was made as regards the  right\r\n\r\nof a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies for a\r\n\r\njob  in the government service. I would suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  same  privilege which is offered to a local-born\r\n\r\nsubject  should  also be given to a  citizen  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom and Colonies, and I feel  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be no discrimination in regard to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government policy clearly recognizes that\r\n\r\nthere is unemployment on a wide scale, but I am  very\r\n\r\ndisappointed  to  see that no suggestions  have  been\r\n\r\nmade  regarding  measures  that  will  be  taken   to\r\n\r\neliminate  unemployment. My friend and colleague  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand Welfare on various occasions insisted in the past\r\n\r\nCouncil that Government should appoint a committee to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  the extent of unemployment in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand   to   find   ways  and  means   of   eliminating\r\n\r\nunemployment.  I  hope that the  Minister  would  now\r\n\r\nappoint  a  committee  as soon  as  possible  as  the\r\n\r\nposition of unemployment in Singapore has come  to  a\r\n\r\nvery grave crisis. However, the Government might  try\r\n\r\nto say that there is no unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom, Sir, I understand that all\r\n\r\nemployers  are  obliged to register  their  vacancies\r\n\r\nwith  the  Labour Exchange. I think  if  we  were  to\r\n\r\nprepare  some sort of a statutory provision  in  that\r\n\r\nmanner, we would be able to assess the true nature of\r\n\r\nunemployment in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heartily congratulate the Hon. the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  for  having  the vision  in  appointing  an\r\n\r\nEconomic  Commission. I believe that  this  signifies\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  intends to  have  a  Socialist\r\n\r\neconomy  for Singapore, but I would suggest that  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of this Commission should be very  carefully\r\n\r\nselected because I believe that you can be sure of an\r\n\r\nindependent  report if we are to have members  of  an\r\n\r\nindependent character. I would suggest, Sir, for  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister's consideration, that a member of  the\r\n\r\nECAFE  be  taken  as a member of this Commission  and\r\n\r\nthat  some hearings of this Commission should be made\r\n\r\nin  public so that each and every individual  who  is\r\n\r\ninterested  in  the economy of Singapore  can  appear\r\n\r\nbefore  the Commission and state his views.  I  would\r\n\r\nalso  urge,  Sir,  that this Commission  should  have\r\n\r\nclose liaison with other specialised agencies of  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has now proposed to have a Trade\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Council to advise the Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry  on  matters pertaining  to  trade  and\r\n\r\ncommerce,  but I am very disappointed,  Sir,  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  no  advisory council to go into the problem  of\r\n\r\nthe agriculture of this country has been suggested by\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister. Not long ago my hon. Friend  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Ponggol-Tampenis gave a short description\r\n\r\nof the disabilities of the rural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  in  regard to farming and agriculture.  Where\r\n\r\nthe  economy of the country is shaped on a  Socialist\r\n\r\nbasis,  I  have  never  heard  that  the  rural   and\r\n\r\nagricultural economy has been left out. I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthe rural and city economies are closely related.  An\r\n\r\nagricultural   council  would  act  as   a   research\r\n\r\ninstitute  and, with the co-operation of the  farmers\r\n\r\nand  agriculturists, would be able to frame a  policy\r\n\r\nwhich could be implemented both by the Government and\r\n\r\nthe agriculturists themselves. In that way we will be\r\n\r\nable  to raise the standard of the rural economy.  We\r\n\r\nneed  an increase in food production in this country.\r\n\r\nMore  than  50  per  cent of the  food  products  are\r\n\r\nimported  now. It is so because there is  not  enough\r\n\r\nlocal   food  production.  I  would  urge  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister that this should be one of the main tasks of\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry in conjunction with the Trade  Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil. I want to see that a strong hand be given to\r\n\r\nthe Agricultural and Veterinary Departments. I do not\r\n\r\nlike  to  see three or four people working  with  the\r\n\r\nAgricultural or Veterinary Department and then trying\r\n\r\nto do a patchwork of the whole thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government policy on the standard of living\r\n\r\nof  the  working class has shocked me a  great  deal.\r\n\r\nThere  had  been in the past a cry for  minimum  wage\r\n\r\nlegislation.  I  realise  that  before  we  can  have\r\n\r\nminimum  wage  legislation we must have the  national\r\n\r\nincome  of  the  country assessed, but  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  have mentioned  something  in  the\r\n\r\npolicy  statement  in  regard  to  its  minimum  wage\r\n\r\npolicy. Today in the city most of the workers of  the\r\n\r\ntransport companies are on strike. Why have they gone\r\n\r\non  strike?  They have gone on strike  because  their\r\n\r\nwages and conditions of service are not satisfactory;\r\n\r\nbecause  they believe that there should be some  sort\r\n\r\nof  a  wage level by which they will be able to carry\r\n\r\non  their lives. If the Government were reluctant  to\r\n\r\nhave  this  minimum wage legislation straightaway,  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest that a committee of inquiry should  be\r\n\r\ninstituted in all industries where there are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwage  disputes, so that the Government  could  assess\r\n\r\nthe  wages and conditions of service offered  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and,  in  co-operation  with  the  employers\r\n\r\nconcerned, settle the disputes amicably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing. We have heard the Government Benchers state\r\n\r\nvery  vehemently that some of the Opposition speakers\r\n\r\nare  speaking  as if they were on election  platforms\r\n\r\nand  that  there is not very much in those  speeches,\r\n\r\nbut  may  I  remind  the Government  Bench  that  the\r\n\r\nelectors  will take them to task on housing  matters?\r\n\r\nThe  rent charged by the Singapore Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\nis  indeed  very high, and every one of  the  elected\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  Labour  Front  has  promised   that\r\n\r\nsomething  will be done to reduce the rent.  Probably\r\n\r\nthe  Government might think that after setting up the\r\n\r\nHousing  Authority they will go into  this  question,\r\n\r\nbut  if  we  are  going to postpone everything  after\r\n\r\nadvice  is  received from other sources, I  think  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  too late. You have to do something  in  the\r\n\r\ninterim  to  find out how far the existing grievances\r\n\r\nare   from  all  quarters.  May  I  suggest  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   that  another  committee   of   inquiry,\r\n\r\ndepartmentally, be set up so as to find out how  hard\r\n\r\nthe  tenants have been affected by the rent increase?\r\n\r\nI was a member of the Singapore Improvement Trust for\r\n\r\nfour  months, and from my experience I can tell  this\r\n\r\nHouse that many of the tenants are unable to pay  the\r\n\r\nrent,  with the result that they receive quit notices\r\n\r\nand they have to find accommodation elsewhere. It may\r\n\r\nbe  that  it might take four or five months more  for\r\n\r\nthe  Housing Authority to be set up and various other\r\n\r\nrelevant  matters  discussed  and  decided,  but  the\r\n\r\nhardship of these tenants can no longer be tolerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is very little mention of the rural housing in\r\n\r\nthis  policy  statement and also in the Labour  Front\r\n\r\nprogramme. Probably the Labour Front elected  Members\r\n\r\nhave  not been elected from the rural areas. I  think\r\n\r\nall of them are invariably from the city. The housing\r\n\r\nsituation in the rural areas is indeed pathetic. They\r\n\r\nare  living invariably in houses where there  are  no\r\n\r\nbathrooms or lavatories; and not only that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith very little accommodation for the entire family.\r\n\r\nAnd  I feel that one of the urgent problems that have\r\n\r\nto  be attended to by the Government would be matters\r\n\r\nrelating to rural housing. The other day, when I  was\r\n\r\ntravelling along Alexandra Road, I happened to see  a\r\n\r\nnotice  board - \"Singapore Improvement Trust  14-Storey\r\n\r\nHouses\".  I  do not think anybody in Singapore  today\r\n\r\nwould  like to live in a 14th storey, particularly  a\r\n\r\nfamily. I would like the Minister for Housing to take\r\n\r\nnote  that most of the people in Singapore  today  do\r\n\r\nnot  like to live in the 14th storey. They would like\r\n\r\nto  live either in the first or the second, not  even\r\n\r\nthe third.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What about the Seventh?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair:</b> Scrap those housing policies and\r\n\r\nhave more houses in the rural areas. Hitherto we have\r\n\r\nbeen  complaining that there is no land in the  city,\r\n\r\nbut  now with the assurance of the Chief Minister  to\r\n\r\nthe  effect  that there will be State acquisition  of\r\n\r\nland  we will not be lacking in land. We will be able\r\n\r\nto  build houses wherever we intend them to be and we\r\n\r\nshall have plenty of them in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to mention a very important factor\r\n\r\nin  regard  to the rent formula and how that  can  be\r\n\r\nreduced. I have been championing this cause for  many\r\n\r\nyears,  but  there have been some legal complications\r\n\r\nin regard to this, and I hope that this will be taken\r\n\r\nup  by  the Government. The City Council of Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday  is collecting 34 per cent assessment from  all\r\n\r\nhouses  within the city limits, but a local authority\r\n\r\nof  that  nature has no moral obligation for  housing\r\n\r\nthe  people  in the city. Shame! I have travelled  in\r\n\r\nmany  places, in London and Ireland when I was  on  a\r\n\r\nparliamentary course, and people told me that  modern\r\n\r\ngovernments  do  realise that  the  State  and  local\r\n\r\ngovernments share the responsibility for housing  the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  here  in  Singapore  we  have  a  local\r\n\r\ngovernment denying the fact that they have any  moral\r\n\r\nobligation  at  all for housing the  people  in  this\r\n\r\ncity. The Municipal Ordinance at the moment does  not\r\n\r\nprovide money being spent on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhousing,   and   I  hope  the  Minister   for   Local\r\n\r\nGovernment, Lands and Housing, when he introduces the\r\n\r\nBill on the formation of the City and Island Council,\r\n\r\nwill  ensure that adequate provision is made in  that\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to enable the City Council to spend  money\r\n\r\non  subsidising  housing. The 34 per cent  assessment\r\n\r\ncharged to the Singapore Improvement Trust is  really\r\n\r\nthe  basic  difficulty in regard to  rent,  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil's  argument being that the Improvement  Trust\r\n\r\nhouses should be treated in the same way as any other\r\n\r\nhouses built by private citizens. I do not agree with\r\n\r\nthat  because both the City Council and the Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement Trust are public bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of education, again - I did not number my\r\n\r\ndisappointments - it is again a disappointment that  no\r\n\r\nmention  has been made in regard to adult  education.\r\n\r\nWe not only want a democratic form of government, but\r\n\r\nwe do want a democratic form of society, and this can\r\n\r\nonly  be brought about by encouraging, helping  adult\r\n\r\neducation.  I do believe that the Labour  Front  will\r\n\r\nnot overlook this matter. Probably they had forgotten\r\n\r\nto write it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In matters regarding legislation, Sir, foremost that\r\n\r\ncomes  to my mind is the Rent Control Ordinance which\r\n\r\nI  referred to some time ago. I do not think  that  I\r\n\r\nshould  elaborate the various difficulties the people\r\n\r\nare  suffering due to the vagueness of this Ordinance\r\n\r\nbut  I  do  hope that in due course Government  would\r\n\r\namend  this  legislation  in  the  interest  of   the\r\n\r\ntenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Immigration Ordinance is giving another headache\r\n\r\nto  the people of Singapore, and quite recently  many\r\n\r\nfamilies  in  my constituency have been subjected  to\r\n\r\nvery  severe mental anxiety, in that they are  unable\r\n\r\nto  bring  their wives or children or  their  mothers\r\n\r\nhere because of the discretion that is vested in  the\r\n\r\nController  of Immigration and now in  the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Labour  and  Welfare.  Although   the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  lies  with him and  although  people  can\r\n\r\nconfide in him so that he will use his discretion  to\r\n\r\nthe  satisfaction  of  the  people,  there  are  very\r\n\r\nrelevant clauses which require amendment, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI do hope, again, that the Labour Front will stick to\r\n\r\nthe  promises they have made some weeks ago in regard\r\n\r\nto the amendment of this Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of local government, Sir, it has\r\n\r\nbeen  announced  that a Bill will be  coming  up  for\r\n\r\nconsideration of this Chamber very soon, and I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  mention, Sir, that the provision of elected\r\n\r\nDistrict  Council Committees should be  an  important\r\n\r\nfeature.  I  think, if I remember it  correctly,  His\r\n\r\nExcellency the Governor did mention the provision  of\r\n\r\nsuch  committees in his Address last year. If we have\r\n\r\nsuch  committees,  I do believe that  democracy  will\r\n\r\nstart  from the bottom instead of from the top as  at\r\n\r\npresent, because people will enjoy a greater  measure\r\n\r\nof  democracy starting from their own places,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink  that is a really good sign for the  future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport. I think I better wait until the Minister comes in. I will go on to the other items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land. I have a quarrel with the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Which government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> I might call it \"Liberal\", but I do not\r\n\r\nknow whether Mr Speaker will rule me out of order. I\r\n\r\nthought  of  giving the explanation later  on  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech why I come to that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, land is supposed to be a very necessary element\r\n\r\nin  the life of man. I do not know how far this right\r\n\r\nhas  been accepted by the present Government. I  only\r\n\r\nread in their policy statement that they are going to\r\n\r\nacquire  land  for public purposes. Socialists,  like\r\n\r\nmyself, will not agree that land acquisition  is  the\r\n\r\nonly  means  to socialise the country.  In  my  view,\r\n\r\nthere should be an agrarian policy, a policy by which\r\n\r\nthe  land can be redistributed to the people who  are\r\n\r\nreally  in  need.  Acquisition  can  be  done  by   a\r\n\r\nProgressive government, a Democratic government,  but\r\n\r\ndefinitely not a P.A.P. government, but I think that if\r\n\r\nthe  Government believes in real, modern,  democratic\r\n\r\nSocialism, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy  of  land  reform is the  significant  factor,\r\n\r\nexcluding  of course nationalisation. But  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  why  the  present Government has  hesitated  in\r\n\r\nmaking out a firm policy on land reform in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore we have numerous acres of land on 99-and\r\n\r\n999-year  leases,  by which many people  have  become\r\n\r\nrich. They re-allot their land to other people;  they\r\n\r\nget their land rent and if they have built houses  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own  land,  they  get \"tea  money\"  and  other\r\n\r\nprofits  from their houses. I do not believe  that  a\r\n\r\nSocialist government will allow that to happen. I  do\r\n\r\nsuggest,  Sir, for your consideration that Government\r\n\r\nshould  revise  the  terms of these  99-and  999-year\r\n\r\nleases  and  take  over all those excess  lands  from\r\n\r\npeople,  give  them land according to the  number  of\r\n\r\npersons in the family and a little bit more in  order\r\n\r\nthat they can adjust themselves; take over the excess\r\n\r\nand  redistribute  it  to the  landless  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. A survey of all lands, now lying idle  but\r\n\r\nsuitable for farming, should be made for distribution\r\n\r\nto  the  peasants. There is difficulty being suffered\r\n\r\nby   the   farmers  and  agricultural   citizens   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  in  that  they  cannot  obtain  land  for\r\n\r\ncultivation.   I   feel   myself,   after   a   close\r\n\r\nexamination, that there are numerous pieces  of  land\r\n\r\nin  Singapore which are lying idle and which  can  be\r\n\r\nmade really productive. I do suggest that a survey of\r\n\r\nall  swamp  areas  be  taken  and  wherever  possible\r\n\r\nreclaim  them  for  various  purposes.  If  it  is  a\r\n\r\nbuilding  site,  build  houses;  and  if  it  is   an\r\n\r\nagricultural  site,  give  it  to  the  farmers   for\r\n\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy on ex-convicts also requires the\r\n\r\nattention of the Government. At the moment  they  are\r\n\r\ndisregarded not only by the Government - in  fact,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should have set an example in  this,  but\r\n\r\nthey  are not doing it - but also by many employers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They are being looked after  by  a  small\r\n\r\ngroup  of public-spirited body of people, the  After-Care Association, who are trying to rehabilitate them\r\n\r\nfor a short time. They require assistance very badly.\r\n\r\nThe  State also assists in the rehabilitation of  ex-convicts. Another\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoint  which  comes to my mind when  I  talk  of  ex-convicts is the fact that they are not recognized  as\r\n\r\nmen  in  society by Government. There is  a  General\r\n\r\nOrder  of  the  Singapore  Government  which  is  not\r\n\r\nredundant  yet, saying that Government employees  who\r\n\r\nhave  been convicted will not be re-employed, and  if\r\n\r\nthey  are people with long experience, they will  get\r\n\r\nno  gratuity.  I hope and believe, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Hon. the  Chief  Minister  will  use  his\r\n\r\nscissors  to  cut this first red tape in the  General\r\n\r\nOrders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.\r\n\r\nMay  I inquire from the Member for Seletar (Mr Nair)\r\n\r\nhow   many  ex-convicts  there  are  in  the  Seletar\r\n\r\nDivision?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not only\r\n\r\nrepresenting the Seletar Division. I have,  I  think,\r\n\r\nthe  privilege  of raising any matters in  connection\r\n\r\nwith the people of Singapore in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One matter which comes to my mind is the cottage\r\n\r\nindustries  in the rural areas which will  raise  the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  the rural people. So far, the Government\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  have not shown great interest  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  industries,  and  I  believe  that  with   the\r\n\r\nassistance of the Colombo Plan we will be able to get\r\n\r\nhelp to start cottage industries in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of transport comes next, and I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  I can wait for the Hon. the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommunications  and  Works. Some  time  ago,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\naddressed  the  Front Bench opposite  to  me  as  the\r\n\r\n\"Liberal    Government\".   A   Socialist   Government\r\n\r\npreaching  Socialism would bear  in  mind  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  show  the  gravity and  seriousness  of  their\r\n\r\npolicy   to  the  people  at  the  opportune  moment.\r\n\r\nYesterday  the  Hon. the Minister for  Communications\r\n\r\nand  Works said that the Government intends  to  take\r\n\r\nover  public  transport, in other words,  nationalise\r\n\r\nit,   when  the  time  comes,  and  if  there  is   a\r\n\r\npossibility. I would tell this House that the test of\r\n\r\nsincerity  of  the  Socialists  is  very  near.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Traction  Company's  agreement  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment expires\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  time  in  June, and if the  Government  is  not\r\n\r\nmaking a firm stand on it, I would assure this  House\r\n\r\nthat  I  will introduce a motion to test how far  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is Socialist. This is the only opportunity\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  has to  show  the  people  the\r\n\r\nreality  of Socialism in its surest and truest  form.\r\n\r\nThere is no getting away with it. Sir, some time ago,\r\n\r\nI   called   the  present  Government  the   \"Liberal\r\n\r\nGovernment\". The Labour Front, the day when it wedded\r\n\r\nthe  Alliance, became Liberal. I do not know  whether\r\n\r\nthat marital relation has probably caused a change in\r\n\r\nthe Front's Socialist policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another test, Sir, for the Government, is equal pay\r\n\r\nfor  equal  work.  It has been mentioned  in  various\r\n\r\nquarters  that real Socialists believe in  equal  pay\r\n\r\nfor  equal  work.  My hon. Friend  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and Welfare will bear me out, while  we  were\r\n\r\nsitting  together  on this Bench  as  Socialists,  we\r\n\r\ndemanded  equal  pay  for  equal  work.  This  is  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to show to the people of Singapore  that\r\n\r\nthe Labour Front believe in what they say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, as a Member of this Assembly returned\r\n\r\nfrom   a   rural   constituency,  I  am   very   much\r\n\r\ndisappointed  to  see that although  there  has  been\r\n\r\nmention of some development in the rural areas, it is\r\n\r\nnot  altogether  quite  satisfactory.  Every  time  I\r\n\r\nmentioned in the last Council the inadequacy of rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  I  was asked to refer  to  the  various\r\n\r\ngovernment expenditures in regard to the rural areas,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  \"road, one mile, $40,000\" and some  drains,\r\n\r\nhalf  a mile or ten feet, so many dollars. Government\r\n\r\nhas  been  neglecting the rural areas, a neglect  not\r\n\r\nintentional  at all, but a neglect which was  limited\r\n\r\nby  financial means. But this time when  there  is  a\r\n\r\npromise  of raising the standard of living  of  every\r\n\r\nhuman  being in this colony, I think the rural people\r\n\r\nshould  not lag behind. We have been doing a  lot  of\r\n\r\npatchwork here and there. We asked for water  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas;  the Rural Board fixed up  a  standpipe\r\n\r\nthere.  Tomorrow  I write in to say that  in  Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad there is no post-box; and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostal  Department  will fix a  post-box  there.  Our\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the  rural  areas  has  always  been\r\n\r\npatchwork  and  the result has been  that  today  the\r\n\r\nrural people have not reached the same economic level\r\n\r\nas  that  of the people in the city. They are  mostly\r\n\r\nunder-employed.   Their   economy   is    far    from\r\n\r\nsatisfactory. They have not the amenities which  they\r\n\r\nshould enjoy as citizens, although they pay rates and\r\n\r\ntaxes regularly in just the same way as the people in\r\n\r\nthe  city. There is only one right and proper way  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping   the  rural  areas,  and  that   is   all\r\n\r\ndepartments should co-ordinate their activities  under\r\n\r\na   planning  committee.  I  suggest  that  a   Rural\r\n\r\nDevelopment     Council    be    established     with\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from various Government  departments,\r\n\r\nincluding  the City Council, which is the  water  and\r\n\r\nelectricity authority, so that rural development  can\r\n\r\ngo  slowly  but steadily towards a happier goal.  The\r\n\r\nfact that the Labour Front policy was not accepted by\r\n\r\nmy  constituency and other rural people clearly shows\r\n\r\nthat  there was something lacking in it, and that  is\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the rural areas, which  I  have  now\r\n\r\nstated  for your consideration. There is  no  way  of\r\n\r\ndeveloping the rural areas other than through  better\r\n\r\nco-ordination and planning. I do hope that Government\r\n\r\nwill pay attention to this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems that\r\n\r\nthe  sins  and omissions of past administrations  are\r\n\r\nnow  visited upon us on this side of the House. I  am\r\n\r\nsure  it  is  realised that we, on this side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  contested the election on this  programme  in\r\n\r\norder to adjust the ills that we felt were there, and\r\n\r\nit is indeed a very happy indication to us, Sir, that\r\n\r\nmany  of my hon. Friends over that side of the  House\r\n\r\nmade  reference to this blueprint of ours for  a  new\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I did not find any of them attacking  any\r\n\r\nparticular item. What they did say was that this one-year programme of ours was not enough and was not  in\r\n\r\nkeeping with what we said we wanted to do. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  can  say,  Sir,  that this then  is  the  accepted\r\n\r\nblueprint for a new Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the various points that have been\r\n\r\nmade in regard to my particular Ministry. Let us take\r\n\r\nthe  Labour Bill, Sir. It was pointed out that in  so\r\n\r\nfar  as  the Labour Bill is concerned we had to  seek\r\n\r\nthe  agreement of Her Majesty's Government, and there\r\n\r\nwas  therefore resentment; and it was also  mentioned\r\n\r\nby  one hon. Member that, to his knowledge, there was\r\n\r\nno  Ordinance that covered the civilian employees  of\r\n\r\nthe Armed Services. I would like to point out for the\r\n\r\ninformation of this House that to-date there are  two\r\n\r\nOrdinances - the Central Provident Fund Ordinance  and\r\n\r\nthe  Workmen's Compensation Ordinance - that cover  all\r\n\r\ncivilian  employees of the three Services.  The  fact\r\n\r\nthat   the  United  Kingdom  Government  has  to   be\r\n\r\nconsulted  is in the same way as most large employers\r\n\r\nof  labour have to be consulted when we try to  bring\r\n\r\nin  anything new. Both parties must be consulted, and\r\n\r\nI can assure this House that that Labour Bill will be\r\n\r\nlaid on this Table - the Second Reading will be on  the\r\n\r\n24th of May.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another one is the Trade Disputes Ordinance. Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  taken  note  of this Ordinance  that  has  been\r\n\r\nbrought  up by the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew),  and I assure him that his  remarks  will\r\n\r\nreceive my urgent consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong)\r\n\r\nbrought  up the question of what steps the Government\r\n\r\nproposes to take to encourage trade unionism. We have\r\n\r\nstated, Sir, in our policy that we will do all we can\r\n\r\nto  encourage  the movement, because we believe  that\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union movement has an important  part  to\r\n\r\nplay  in our programme for a new Singapore. But, Sir,\r\n\r\nhaving been a trade unionist myself and still  am,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to say to a fellow trade unionist that the\r\n\r\nstrength  of any trade union organisation is  not  in\r\n\r\nany  help  that the Government can give, but  in  the\r\n\r\nsolidarity  of the workers. They should work  towards\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always felt, Sir, and I have spoken on other\r\n\r\noccasions in this hall, that the English language  is\r\n\r\nindeed a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult language to understand. We find that  while\r\n\r\nthe   Governor's  Address  covers  just  a   one-year\r\n\r\nprogramme,  yes it is being compared with  the  four-year  programme and hurled back at us. They  said  we\r\n\r\nare  not  doing  enough. We have  to  carry  out  our\r\n\r\nprogramme  year  by year, and we  know  that  we  are\r\n\r\nanswerable to our electors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon (Mr Lim Choon Mong)\r\n\r\ntouched on the question of boys' clubs. He said  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing in this Message that  conveyed  an\r\n\r\nindication of Government's interest in the activities\r\n\r\nof  boys'  clubs. I would refer him, Sir, to  page  6\r\n\r\n(third  paragraph, column 8, of the Official Report).\r\n\r\nMay I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Community Centre scheme will be developed and\r\n\r\nmore  facilities  provided  for  the  underprivileged\r\n\r\nyouths of Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir.

My hon. Friend\r\n\r\nof the People's Action Party said yesterday, \"So long\r\n\r\nas you behave yourselves we will be with you.\" What a\r\n\r\npaternalistic statement! We say, \"So long as  we  are\r\n\r\nright,  we  ask  you  to vote against  us.\"  Sir,  we\r\n\r\ncontested the election not so very long ago,  only  a\r\n\r\nmonth ago, and we got returned here. We have not  had\r\n\r\nthe time - we have stated in the Governor's Address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministers only had a  few  days  -  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  the work that is ahead of us.

I am happy  to\r\n\r\nlearn  that he is now in agreement that there  should\r\n\r\nbe  amendments  to  this Ordinance.  Reports  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  lately  showed that the  People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty  was  organising  unions  into  opposing   this\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund, and when it was pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  by opposing it, instead of trying to amend  it,\r\n\r\nwas  just playing into the hands of the employers,  I\r\n\r\nthink they soon realised the error of their ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Sir,\r\n\r\nyesterday  I invited, I welcomed honest criticism.  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Hurl your rocks of honest criticism.\"  I  did\r\n\r\nnot  say,  \"Sling your mud.\" I have no use  for  mud,\r\n\r\nalthough  I understand that it makes good manure  for\r\n\r\npolitical growth.. I am not a politician, Sir. I seek\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of  this country along simple,  obvious\r\n\r\nways. We have been reminded by the other side of  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of office. I would remind Members that\r\n\r\none  can abuse too much the irresponsibility of  lack\r\n\r\nof power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew), who\r\n\r\nhas  so  aptly been termed by my friend and colleague\r\n\r\nas the cock that rouses the sun, says that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nstands  for  freedom, and now that freedom  has  been\r\n\r\ndiscovered   by  the  P.A.P.,  the   P.A.P. has   a\r\n\r\nprescriptive  right to it, patented  and  hallmarked,\r\n\r\nand  those of us, Sir, who seek to serve freedom must\r\n\r\nnow go to the Member for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  for his chop - that  symbol  with  such\r\n\r\nunhappy  memories once worn by the  Black  Shirts  of\r\n\r\nEngland.  Sir, this hon. Gentleman, who has appointed\r\n\r\nhimself  the rearguard of the Labour U.M.N.O.-M.C.A.-Malay Union Alliance Coalition, speaks of dreams.  It\r\n\r\nis  our duty today to act. This hon. Gentleman offers\r\n\r\nus,  Sir,  his  co-operation if we behave  ourselves.\r\n\r\nHaving watched the conduct of the hon. Gentleman  and\r\n\r\nhis  colleagues, it seems to us plain  on  this  side\r\n\r\nthat the offer is but the offer of the kiss of Judas;\r\n\r\nthat it is nothing but a cheap political manoeuvre to\r\n\r\nseek  in this House to obtain credit for what we  can\r\n\r\nachieve on the Government side, and to obtain  credit\r\n\r\nfor  what we cannot achieve, so that he can have  the\r\n\r\nbest  of  two  worlds.  That  is  not  the  type   of\r\n\r\nco-operation I sought, Sir, and it is with regret that\r\n\r\nI  notice,  at  the termination of this debate,  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  very  little I can expect in  the  way  of\r\n\r\nconstructive   statesmanship   from   hon.    Members\r\n\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentleman of that Party - I think he is from Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah  (Mr Lim Ching Siong) - has even indulged in  an\r\n\r\nextraordinary  exhibition when he twisted  our  words\r\n\r\nwhereby  we  seek equal treatment for all schools  as\r\n\r\nmeaning that we wish to destroy Chinese culture. Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a proverb or saying - Honi soit  qui  mal  y\r\n\r\npense - it  is the evil mind that will always  find  an\r\n\r\nevil explanation. I have no patience, Sir, with those\r\n\r\nwho  can  only  see  evil  in  the  efforts  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment to secure the well-being of the people  of\r\n\r\nthis  country, and if that is what the hon. Gentleman\r\n\r\nfrom Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching Siong) wishes to read\r\n\r\ninto   the  simple  statement  that  we  want   equal\r\n\r\ntreatment for all schools, then he is welcome to that\r\n\r\nevil interpretation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have these quibbles. Why have we left out\r\n\r\nthe word \"compulsory\" from \"compulsory education\"? Is\r\n\r\nit  the same thing as education for all? Sir, we need\r\n\r\nno   compulsory  education  today.  Our   youth   are\r\n\r\nthirsting  for  education. We need to give  them  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to slake that thirst, and our duty is  to\r\n\r\nprovide,  and  we shall seek to fulfil that  duty  to\r\n\r\nprovide, the opportunities for education. If and when\r\n\r\nthe time comes that we find there is any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsection, any appreciable section, of our youth  that\r\n\r\ndoes   not   seek   education  and   we   have   the\r\n\r\nopportunities available for them, then will  be  the\r\n\r\ntime to speak of compulsion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about public meetings and the\r\n\r\nright  to  public assembly and free speech. The  hon.\r\n\r\nand  learned  Member for Tanjong  Pagar  should  know\r\n\r\nbetter.   The  question  of  permission  for   public\r\n\r\nmeetings  does  not  come under the  dread  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations, as he and his colleagues seem to  think.\r\n\r\nIt  comes under the Minor Offences Ordinance. Sir, in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  as a result of the Emergency attitude  of\r\n\r\nmind  of the police, these public meetings have  been\r\n\r\nforbidden in open places. There has been, as far as I\r\n\r\nam aware, no impediment to their being held in halls,\r\n\r\nbut they have been forbidden - or rather permission has\r\n\r\nbeen  very  grudgingly and very  rarely  granted  for\r\n\r\npublic meetings in open places. This Government, Sir,\r\n\r\nhas  relaxed  that  rule, for which  it  receives  no\r\n\r\ncredit, to the extent that now public meetings may be\r\n\r\nheld  in  open places until dusk; but why,  asks  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanjong Pagar, can we not woo democracy in\r\n\r\nthe  dead  of  night? It is because,  Sir,  democracy\r\n\r\nrequires respect for minority feelings, and there  is\r\n\r\nno  doubt,  Sir, that the seven years under  the  so-called  state  of  Emergency through  which  we  have\r\n\r\nlived,  has  convinced  many reasonable  people  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  threat to security, and they  fear  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of disorders from any extension  of  the\r\n\r\nright  of  public assembly. Government  is  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat there is no real basis for that fear, but at the\r\n\r\nsame  time we have to respect their feelings  and  we\r\n\r\nare   ourselves  feeling  our  way  to   a   complete\r\n\r\nrelaxation of that rule by this first instalment. And\r\n\r\nwhen  we have proved, as we have no doubt it will  be\r\n\r\nproved,  that  there is no danger in public  assembly\r\n\r\nuntil  dusk, we can then go on to the  extension  of\r\n\r\nthat  rule. It is the same, Sir, as the procedure  we\r\n\r\nhave  adopted  with  reference  to  multi-lingualism,\r\n\r\nwhere  there is very honest fear on the  part  of  an\r\n\r\nappreciable section of decent human beings  who  have\r\n\r\nno  particular political affiliations, that  this  is\r\n\r\nimpracticable; and we are now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nseeking to prove to them in a lesser sphere than this\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  practicable  and  so  toward  winning\r\n\r\nunanimous  support.  It  is  not  in  the  realm   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  to ride rough-shod over minority  feelings\r\n\r\nand  to  steamroller its way through,  because  of  a\r\n\r\nmajority that it may have in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other aspects of the Emergency Regulations on\r\n\r\nwhich   hon.   Members  opposite  have   so   enjoyed\r\n\r\nthemselves, I shall not answer because it will be  my\r\n\r\nunhappy  duty, after this item of business,  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  Emergency  Regulations,  and  I  think  it\r\n\r\nappropriate at that juncture to speak to hon. Members\r\n\r\non that point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been criticised from political extremes\r\n\r\nfor  our attitude towards compensation of expatriates\r\n\r\nwho  may  be  found redundant. It has been  suggested\r\n\r\nthat we have too tender a regard for these gentlemen;\r\n\r\nthat  maybe we are being bullied; and that  maybe  we\r\n\r\nhave  been subverted. Sir, our conduct in this matter\r\n\r\nwill  be  guided by one single principle  that  I  am\r\n\r\ncertain this House must at all times accept, and that\r\n\r\nis  the principle of justice to all human beings, and\r\n\r\ncertainly to our own employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of Malayanisation, I must confess\r\n\r\nthat I am glad to find such vehement concurrence with\r\n\r\nour  attitude from Members opposite, and I have  some\r\n\r\nsympathy  for  the  views of the Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar   on   the  subject  of  the  Public   Services\r\n\r\nCommission.  I  do  recognise the  general  trend  of\r\n\r\npublic  feeling towards the officers who are  members\r\n\r\nof  that Commission. I cannot say that I am satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  that  attitude  is justified.  I  do  not  know\r\n\r\nenough.    I   do   acknowledge   that   this    very\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory state of Malayanisation of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  at  the  present  juncture  is  perhaps   an\r\n\r\nindication that those officers are not adequate,  but\r\n\r\nit  need  not necessarily be their fault  and  I  can\r\n\r\nassure the House of this - that long before this  House\r\n\r\nmet, that matter was already under investigation, and\r\n\r\nstill  is,  and  I sincerely hope that  hon.  Members\r\n\r\nopposite  will  take  the  opportunity  at  the  next\r\n\r\nsitting  to  place questions of a precise  character,\r\n\r\nseeking   clarification  on  that  aspect  on   which\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  give  you  clear  information,   and\r\n\r\nperhaps\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput a motion on for the Adjournment. I can say for my\r\n\r\nside  of the House, Sir, that we want to hide nothing\r\n\r\nthere.   Our   flag  is  nailed  to   the   mast   of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation at a rapid pace, and  if  we  fail  in\r\n\r\nthat  I  shall not wait for the P.A.P. to ask  me  to\r\n\r\nresign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, we heard the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\n(Mr  Lim  Choon Mong), and today we had a  newspaper\r\n\r\nasking  where were the Progressives. The rump of  the\r\n\r\nProgressives is here, Sir, and it seems  to  consider\r\n\r\nits  main function to be to act as apologists for the\r\n\r\ndays  of  arrogant glory that can be  no  more.  That\r\n\r\nextraordinary  spectacle of the Member for  Serangoon\r\n\r\ntelling  us,  \"Of course my Party does  not  disagree\r\n\r\nwith  multi-lingualism! Do  have  it!  Bring  in  the\r\n\r\nHottentot and Eskimo languages, and Sanskrit, and  do\r\n\r\nnot  leave  out a single dialect! Don't!\" The  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanjong Pagar pointed out that nobody is going to\r\n\r\nbe  beguiled  by that sort of nonsense. We  are  glad\r\n\r\nindeed to have forewarning that in this House will be\r\n\r\ncontinued  the tradition we have come to expect  from\r\n\r\nthat  Party. The hon. Member sitting next to him told\r\n\r\nus,  \"Of  course  it is impracticable and  impossible\r\n\r\ntoday,  but we are not against it.\" It does  suggest,\r\n\r\nSir,  that perhaps multi-lingualism is necessary even\r\n\r\nin  this  House because that kind of logic  I  cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand, and maybe if there was an interpreter  it\r\n\r\nwould help better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing I am indebted to the Member for\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar (Mr Lim Koon Teck), and that is for  his\r\n\r\nassurance of co-operation on the matter of free legal\r\n\r\naid.  That, Sir, I accept unreservedly. I know it  is\r\n\r\ngenuine  and  I know I will receive his very  sincere\r\n\r\nassistance, and I gladly accept it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then heard from the Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R.\r\n\r\nJumabhoy),  whose  first complaint  was  that  I  was\r\n\r\nuncharitable  to  a  former  Member  of  this  House,\r\n\r\nbecause I did not like, and I considered abusive, the\r\n\r\nsuggestion    that   only   dishonest    self-seeking\r\n\r\ndemagogues  would want self-government in  less  than\r\n\r\neight  years.  Now,  if  the Member  for  Telok  Ayer\r\n\r\nconsiders  that  a  just and proper  remark,  I  will\r\n\r\naccept the rebuke for being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuncharitable,  but I trust I speak for  the  rest  of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly when I said that those were  terms  of\r\n\r\nabuse  which you, Sir, would never have permitted  in\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Seletar (Mr M. P. D. Nair) made\r\n\r\ncertain  suggestions of a valuable character,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink he will be pleased to know that the question of\r\n\r\ncitizenship, though we have been but a little time in\r\n\r\noffice,   has   not  been  forgotten;  and   district\r\n\r\ncommittees in the City and Island Council  have  also\r\n\r\nnot  been  forgotten. In fact, there may be room  for\r\n\r\npleasant surprise for him in the sitting to  come  on\r\n\r\nthe  City  and Island Council Bill. But I find  it  a\r\n\r\nlittle  difficult, Sir, to understand one  aspect  of\r\n\r\nhis  address where he said that we should have  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment  for domiciled Malayans as for persons  who\r\n\r\nare British and colonial subjects. That does seem  to\r\n\r\nsuggest - I may be wrong in my interpretation, and if I\r\n\r\nam,  I am sure you will clarify it later - but it  does\r\n\r\nseem  to  suggest  that what the Member  for  Seletar\r\n\r\nwants   is  complete  abolition  of  any  distinction\r\n\r\nbetween the domiciled races and expatriates. That the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot accept and will not accept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D.

Marshall (Chief Minister and Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is now my\r\n\r\nduty to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with subsection\r\n\r\n(3)   of  section  3  of  the  Emergency  Regulations\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1948 (No. 17 of 1948), as amended  by  the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations  (Amendment)  Ordinance,  1948\r\n\r\n(No.  39  of  1948),  and  the Emergency  Regulations\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Ordinance, 1951 (No. 9 of 1951),  adopts\r\n\r\nthe  Proclamation made by the Governor in Council  on\r\n\r\nthe  21st  day  of  April,  1955,  and  published  as\r\n\r\nNotification No. S 113 in the Gazette Supplement  No.\r\n\r\n30  of  21st  April, 1955, as contained in  Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper  No.  S.L. 2 of 1955, prolonging for a  further\r\n\r\nperiod  of  three months commencing the 22nd  day  of\r\n\r\nApril, 1955, the period specified in the Proclamation\r\n\r\nof  Emergency  made on the 6th day of January,  1955,\r\n\r\nand published as Notification No. S 16 in the Gazette\r\n\r\nSupplement No. 3 of 14th January, 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it all means this: it is my duty now to ask\r\n\r\nthis  House to confirm the Proclamation made  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  to  extend  the  period  of  Emergency  for\r\n\r\nanother three months; and these words have a very bad\r\n\r\ntaste  in  my  mouth. Many years ago I  used  to  act\r\n\r\nprofessionally  in assisting persons  caught  in  the\r\n\r\nwide net of these Regulations and I gained then, Sir,\r\n\r\na  strong distaste for arbitrary executive power  and\r\n\r\nthe abuse to which it was prone. It is not within  my\r\n\r\njurisdiction, as hon. Members know,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  normal course to move this motion. Internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  is in the portfolio of the Chief Secretary,\r\n\r\nbut  I  felt,  Sir, that to leave  it  to  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary   to  move  it  this  time  may   raise   a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding as to the true position. He may well\r\n\r\nhave  hurled  against him opprobrium  for  continuing\r\n\r\nthese  Regulations when the decision is not, in fact,\r\n\r\nhis  alone.  It is because of the rule of  collective\r\n\r\nMinisterial responsibility and because I want that to\r\n\r\nbe  clearly understood not only in this House but  in\r\n\r\nthe  country, that I sought this duty of  moving  the\r\n\r\nadoption of the Proclamation and that I stand to face\r\n\r\nthe  opprobrium which such a move may bring. It would\r\n\r\nnot  be  fair  to  the Chief Secretary,  nor  to  the\r\n\r\nOfficials, to look upon this move as being  one  made\r\n\r\nby the Chief Secretary or forced on Government by the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Members  of the Council of  Ministers.  The\r\n\r\nCouncil  of Ministers, Sir, as you are aware,  has  a\r\n\r\nmajority  of  six  Members of this House  as  against\r\n\r\nthree   Official  Ministers,  and  however   strongly\r\n\r\nOfficial  Ministers may put their views, and  however\r\n\r\nstrongly  they may object to a line of  policy  which\r\n\r\nthe  other Ministers seek to enforce, it is now clear\r\n\r\nthat  once  a  decision is taken in the Council,  the\r\n\r\nOfficials will loyally abide by the policy  and  will\r\n\r\ncarry  it out; so that the fact that I stand here  to\r\n\r\nmove  this  motion means it has the approval  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil of Ministers. If the Council of Ministers had\r\n\r\ndecided  otherwise, you would have had all  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  on  the Front Bench following  a  policy  of\r\n\r\nrepealing  the Proclamation, whatever His  Excellency\r\n\r\nmay  decide to do thereafter. I think that should  be\r\n\r\nclearly understood. I have received to date loyal co-operation, which is a happy augury for the future and\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the  basis, if I may say so,  Sir,  of  my\r\n\r\nbelief   in   the   present   workability   of   this\r\n\r\nconstitution - a  constitution  which   gives   us   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to seek self-government  today.  It  may\r\n\r\nwell  be  that in times to come, in matters  such  as\r\n\r\nperhaps this one where we cannot agree, we shall find\r\n\r\nfriction,  but  I  still  believe  we  will  get  co-operation once a decision is taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, gentlemen, it is my duty to tell\r\n\r\nyou why we of the Council of Ministers are supporting\r\n\r\nHis  Excellency in this act. For seven years a  state\r\n\r\nof emergency has prevailed in this territory with its\r\n\r\nconcomitant Emergency Regulations. During those seven\r\n\r\nyears the Emergency Regulations have been an integral\r\n\r\naspect of our fabric of security. We have been but  a\r\n\r\nfortnight  in office, Sir, working into a  new  shoe,\r\n\r\nfinding our way about, with no traditions behind  us.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had hammered out the Address which you\r\n\r\nheard  and had to take a decision on this very  vital\r\n\r\nmatter,  we  had  an opportunity  for  but  the  most\r\n\r\ncursory  investigation into the Emergency Regulations\r\n\r\nand  into  the state of emergency. Every  government,\r\n\r\nSir,  has  to  depend  on  its  permanent  staff  for\r\n\r\nassistance   in  understanding  various  aspects   of\r\n\r\nofficial  work.  In  this particular  matter  we  are\r\n\r\nstrongly  advised by persons responsible for internal\r\n\r\nsecurity that there is, in fact, a continuing danger,\r\n\r\nand   that  the  continuance  of  the  Emergency   is\r\n\r\nessential for the security of the territory.  We  say\r\n\r\nfrankly,  Sir,  that  we have not  had  the  time  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate these matters ourselves. We have had  but\r\n\r\na  little  time  for a cursory investigation  of  the\r\n\r\nworkings  of  the  Emergency Regulations,  and  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  you  have  seen  the  repeal  of  some  eight\r\n\r\nRegulations  and  some  minor  others.  We  take   no\r\n\r\nparticular pride in that repeal. Let that be  clearly\r\n\r\nunderstood. I do not know if it was mentioned - I think\r\n\r\none  gentleman  did mention it - that they  are  of  no\r\n\r\nparticular  moment.  We on the Government  Bench  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied from the history of their utilisation  that\r\n\r\nthey  are no longer necessary and, in fact, have  not\r\n\r\nbeen necessary for some time, if ever they were. They\r\n\r\nhave  not been necessary for a long time, and  so  we\r\n\r\ncan   throw   them   out  of  hand  without   further\r\n\r\ninvestigation, and that is what has been done, but we\r\n\r\ndo  not  take  any particular pride in  these  minor,\r\n\r\nentirely minor, repeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree completely with the observations of hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  opposite  that we have not  dealt  with  the\r\n\r\nbasic aspect - arrest, detention without open trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI   would  like  to  assure  hon.  Members  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will, within the next three months,  keep\r\n\r\nthe promise that you have heard in the Address of His\r\n\r\nExcellency, that we will exhaustively investigate not\r\n\r\nonly   whether  there  is  any  necessity   for   the\r\n\r\ncontinuation of the state of Emergency, but  even  if\r\n\r\nthat  is  so,  whether there is any necessity  for  a\r\n\r\ncontinuation of the Emergency Regulations as a whole.\r\n\r\nWe   shall  naturally  take  into  consideration  the\r\n\r\nsecurity needs of our neighbour, but our aim will  be\r\n\r\nto  see that not only justice is done - as some Members\r\n\r\nin  the Government believe it is done - but that it  is\r\n\r\ndone publicly for all to see. That is our aim. It  is\r\n\r\nour  hope  that we can achieve that aim.  But  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  hon. Members opposite that within this three-\r\n\r\nmonth  period  there will be a clear  declaration  of\r\n\r\npolicy from the Government as to how much can be done\r\n\r\nto remove this blot from our system of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to second this\r\n\r\nmotion,  and I should, at the outset, like to confirm\r\n\r\nwhat  my  hon. and learned Friend the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  just  said, and make it quite clear, beyond  any\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding  or any precipitated  jubilation  on\r\n\r\nthe  other side of the House, that I not only  second\r\n\r\nthe  motion  that  my hon. Friend has  moved,  but  I\r\n\r\nassociate   myself  fully  with  the   statement   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy which he has given. I should  like\r\n\r\nat  the  same time to associate myself wholeheartedly\r\n\r\nwith  the  remarks that my hon. Friend  made  on  the\r\n\r\nworking  of  our  new  system of government  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the subject of this motion, Sir, there\r\n\r\nare  some  Emergency Regulations which are  generally\r\n\r\naccepted  by  those who have thought  about  them  as\r\n\r\nprovoking   no  serious  objection  in  principle - the\r\n\r\nRegulations governing national registration  and  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  identity  cards, for  instance;  or  those\r\n\r\nauthorising the system of control over supplies which\r\n\r\nwould otherwise cross the Straits of Johore and reach\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  terrorists  fighting  in  the  jungle\r\n\r\nthere. Such Regulations do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninfringe  the  normal principles  of  law  and  legal\r\n\r\nprocedure, and it may be that we can enact them in  a\r\n\r\nnormal  way  and  so remove from them  the  prejudice\r\n\r\nwhich  we all feel against Emergency Regulations  and\r\n\r\nall that those two words have come to imply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my learned Friend has said, the heart of the\r\n\r\nproblem  lies  in  the  special  powers  outside  the\r\n\r\nordinary framework of legal procedure which have been\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the Police and to the Government as  being\r\n\r\nessential  for  the maintenance of  security  against\r\n\r\nthose  who seek to overthrow the properly constituted\r\n\r\ngovernment  of  this territory by  force,  by  secret\r\n\r\nconspiracy, and by murder and by arson; and  in  this\r\n\r\nproblem  we  must, as my hon. Friend has  said,  have\r\n\r\nregard   not  only  to  our  own  security  here   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but  to the needs of our  neighbours  and\r\n\r\nfriends  in the Federation. We have heard  some  very\r\n\r\nwelcome  words in this House in the last two days  on\r\n\r\ncloser   association  with  our  neighbours  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation.  In  considering  this  problem  of   the\r\n\r\nEmergency  Regulations, our ties  of  friendship  may\r\n\r\nwell be put to the test. The special powers which are\r\n\r\nmost objected to are, of course, the powers of arrest\r\n\r\nand  detention  without trial in open court,  and  we\r\n\r\nshall,  as the House has been told, during  the  next\r\n\r\nthree   months,   closely  examine   these   security\r\n\r\nprovisions  and the necessity for them.  Meanwhile  I\r\n\r\nshould   like,   Sir,  to  give   this   House   some\r\n\r\nappreciation  of how those special powers  have  been\r\n\r\nused in recent months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place, they have been used only against\r\n\r\nCommunists.  They are not used against  the  ordinary\r\n\r\ncriminal elements to be found in any country.  It  is\r\n\r\nonly  when  the Police have strong reason to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  a  person is working for the Malayan  Communist\r\n\r\nParty  that they use these special powers  of  arrest\r\n\r\nand  detention. It is quite true, of course, that  it\r\n\r\nis  the  Police who would decide in the  first  place\r\n\r\nwhether  there is strong evidence of connection  with\r\n\r\nthe Malayan Communist Party. But there are checks  on\r\n\r\nPolice  action.  The Police can only  keep  a  person\r\n\r\nunder arrest for a few days. After that,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have to get what is known as a detention  order\r\n\r\nfrom  me, and before I grant that order they have  to\r\n\r\nproduce evidence to me to satisfy me that the  person\r\n\r\nto   be   detained  is  connected  with  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party and that his continued detention  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for securing the public safety.  Otherwise\r\n\r\nhe must be released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further check. A person detained has a\r\n\r\nright  to  object to an advisory committee under  the\r\n\r\nchairmanship of a Judge of the Supreme Court, and the\r\n\r\nRegulations  lay  a specific duty on  the  Judge,  as\r\n\r\nchairman,  to inform the objector of the  grounds  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the  order has been made against him,  and  to\r\n\r\nfurnish  him  with such particulars  as  are  in  the\r\n\r\nopinion  of  the Judge sufficient to  enable  him  to\r\n\r\npresent his case. Of course, these checks are not the\r\n\r\nsame   as  the  right  to  a  trial  in  open  court.\r\n\r\nNevertheless they are checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far, hon. Members may wish to know, have these\r\n\r\nspecial  powers  been  used  recently?  In  1954,  69\r\n\r\ndetention orders were issued. In at least 13 of these\r\n\r\ncases  there  was evidence to show that  the  persons\r\n\r\ndetained  were  concerned  in  murder,  arson,   acid\r\n\r\nthrowing, and other crimes of violence - the crimes  by\r\n\r\nwhich the Malayan Communist Party maintains its reign\r\n\r\nof  fear.  It is because of that fear that  witnesses\r\n\r\nwill not give evidence in public court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past three months, 17 persons have been\r\n\r\ndetained;  five  of them were active  agents  of  the\r\n\r\nParty and three were close sympathisers. Seven others\r\n\r\nwere concerned in supplying a large quantity of hand-grenades  to the Malayan Communist Party,  but  since\r\n\r\nthere  was  insufficient evidence to show that  those\r\n\r\npeople  were  themselves knowingly  working  for  the\r\n\r\nMalayan   Communist  Party,  they  have  since   been\r\n\r\nreleased.  Wherever possible, those who are  detained\r\n\r\nare  prosecuted  in open court, and during  the  last\r\n\r\nthree  months  seven persons have been  convicted  in\r\n\r\ncourt, including one case of the attempted murder  of\r\n\r\na  Chinese school-teacher. It is not always  possible\r\n\r\nto  prosecute  in  court because  the  witnesses  are\r\n\r\nafraid to give evidence in public court. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese cases, the evidence cannot be sifted and tested\r\n\r\nin  an open court of law. But it does not follow from\r\n\r\nthat that the evidence is not true. In fact, for what\r\n\r\nit  is  worth to hon. Members of this House, I myself\r\n\r\nam in no doubt that most, if not all, of the evidence\r\n\r\nobtained  by the Police through their special  powers\r\n\r\nof  arrest  and detention is substantially  true.  So\r\n\r\noften it is dramatically confirmed after much patient\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. At the end of February,\r\n\r\nthe Police recovered 147 hand-grenades which had been\r\n\r\nburied  by the Malayan Communist Party. Now this  was\r\n\r\nthe  direct result of the detention and interrogation\r\n\r\nof  a  chain  of  students who  left  Chinese  middle\r\n\r\nschools in 1953 and 1954. The story started with  the\r\n\r\narrest in January last year of the then leader of the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Communist Party in Singapore. From  him  and\r\n\r\nfrom  others  who were arrested under  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations, the organisation of the Party was slowly\r\n\r\npieced  together and learnt, and many of its  members\r\n\r\nwere  identified until at last the trail led to  this\r\n\r\nsecret  dump of weapons waiting for use. This was  no\r\n\r\nfalse trail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another example. In August 1954, a\r\n\r\nChinese   high   school  student  was  detained   and\r\n\r\ninterrogated. Interrogation revealed that  he  was  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the  branch of the Party believed  to  be\r\n\r\nmainly  concerned with the subversion of workers  and\r\n\r\npeasants;  and  in  this case the trail  led  to  the\r\n\r\nrecovery of two pistols and ammunition, and what  was\r\n\r\nfar, far more important, it led to the arrest of  the\r\n\r\nthree  members  of a three-man killer  squad  of  the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Communist Party. Those three men  are  under\r\n\r\ndetention, and there is strong reason to believe that\r\n\r\nit  was  they who were responsible for the  shootings\r\n\r\nwhich  hon. Members will remember took place  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  half  of last year, including the  treacherous\r\n\r\nshooting  down  of  two  police  constables  in   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Harbour Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you one more example. On 9th April this\r\n\r\nyear,  not  so  long ago, the Police  recovered  two\r\n\r\nautomatics, a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrevolver,   ammunition  and  a  great   quantity   of\r\n\r\nCommunist documents. The information leading to  this\r\n\r\nwas  also  obtained from persons detained  under  the\r\n\r\nEmergency Regulations; and I should like to just tell\r\n\r\nyou  something about those three weapons  which  were\r\n\r\nrecovered  on 9th April. Three weapons. One  of  them\r\n\r\nwas  a revolver which was taken from a detective  who\r\n\r\nwas  shot  and wounded in 1953. One was an  automatic\r\n\r\nwhich had been stolen from a Police vehicle, and  the\r\n\r\nthird -  the  second automatic - had been snatched  from\r\n\r\nthe  body of one of those two Harbour Board policemen\r\n\r\nshot in June last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it was suggested in an earlier debate in this\r\n\r\nHouse that action under the Emergency Regulations was\r\n\r\nagainst   the  interests  of  the  people;  that   it\r\n\r\nrepressed democracy. Does the House really think that\r\n\r\nrecovering  arms  and ammunition from  the  hands  of\r\n\r\nkillers  is a handicap to democracy in the  sense  of\r\n\r\nthe  word  which I hope this House means? Surely  the\r\n\r\ninvestigation of Communist underground ramifications,\r\n\r\nthe  seizure  of their weapons and their  ammunition,\r\n\r\nand the arrest of those that use those weapons in the\r\n\r\nkiller  squads,  are  a vital responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice  and  of the Government? Let us  not,  in  our\r\n\r\nconcern to ensure that justice is seen to be done  to\r\n\r\na person detained, forget the importance of obtaining\r\n\r\nall  possible information so that others will not  be\r\n\r\nshot  dead without cause and without warning, as that\r\n\r\nyoung  Chinese  lad  was shot dead  on  Sunday,  17th\r\n\r\nApril,  called out from a club where, I am  told,  he\r\n\r\nwas playing a harmonica, called out and butchered  in\r\n\r\na  public street and in the drain. Unless the  Police\r\n\r\nhave  some special powers, these killers are unlikely\r\n\r\nto  be  found and locked up, because no one dares  to\r\n\r\nsay  what he knows until he is sure that he  is  safe\r\n\r\nfrom   retaliation.  Is  it  so  wrong   that   those\r\n\r\nresponsible for shooting down those two Harbour Board\r\n\r\npolicemen should be detained? Of course, it would  be\r\n\r\nfar  better if we could bring them to trial  in  open\r\n\r\ncourt in the normal way, but if those who could  give\r\n\r\nthe evidence against them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare too terrified to do so, would it be right that we\r\n\r\nshould  let  those men out tomorrow to shoot  someone\r\n\r\nelse  down? And if, by using the special powers given\r\n\r\nto  them under the Emergency Regulations, the  Police\r\n\r\ncan find and arrest the two men who killed that young\r\n\r\nman  at Cairnhill ten days ago, should we take  those\r\n\r\npowers  away  from the Police? Do not let  us  delude\r\n\r\nourselves  by  thinking that that  was  any  ordinary\r\n\r\ncrime  to be solved in the ordinary way. It was  not.\r\n\r\nHow  can  we expect those who have information  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  of assistance to the Police to come forward\r\n\r\nand  give  it  when  even the  fellow  students,  the\r\n\r\nfriends of that lad, were so terrified of this  power\r\n\r\nof  evil that hangs over this fair city that they did\r\n\r\nnot dare to go to his funeral?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my hon. Friend has said, the Government is deeply\r\n\r\nconcerned  that any special powers that  have  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven to the Police shall be so framed that not  only\r\n\r\nis  justice done, but that it is seen to be done. But\r\n\r\nin  striving  for  this, we have a responsibility  to\r\n\r\nensure  that the rule of law does rule in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  that we are not put at the mercy - if they had any\r\n\r\nmercy - of  those  who have shown so clearly  so  often\r\n\r\nthat  anyone who dares to oppose them will be blotted\r\n\r\nout. Is not this a problem on the principles of which\r\n\r\nat  least  we  can all agree on both  sides  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse?  We  want to see that the law of the  land  is\r\n\r\nenforced through the law courts where every man is innocent  until he is proved guilty after a fair trial.\r\n\r\nYet  at  the same time we must somehow see  that  the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Communist Party does not make a  mockery  of\r\n\r\nour  way of life by its rule of murder and fear.  How\r\n\r\nare  we  going to do both these things? That  is  the\r\n\r\nproblem that the Government is going to try to  solve\r\n\r\nduring  the next three months. Meanwhile we  consider\r\n\r\nthat it would be a betrayal of our responsibility  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  to vary the existing security provisions\r\n\r\nwithout  careful scrutiny. So it is that we ask  this\r\n\r\nHouse   to   approve   this  motion   extending   the\r\n\r\nProclamation  and  the  period  of  Emergency  for  a\r\n\r\nfurther three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that was a\r\n\r\nthrilling  account of what good police and  detective\r\n\r\nwork  can unravel - plus fervent protestations  of  co-operation and collaboration between Ministers in  the\r\n\r\nCouncil of Ministers. I have a sneaking feeling  that\r\n\r\nif  that  same persuasiveness were applied  long  and\r\n\r\nurgently  enough,  a  transformation  might  yet   be\r\n\r\nwrought  upon the Members on the other  side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  who were sent here by the people. But  I  have\r\n\r\nthis  one observation to make: that there is not  one\r\n\r\njot  of  evidence to say that this schoolboy who  was\r\n\r\nshot under very mysterious circumstances was part  of\r\n\r\nan  enormous political feud of terror, other than the\r\n\r\nfact  that he was shot, and that because he was shot,\r\n\r\nhis fellow-students thought it wise to stay away from\r\n\r\nit. That is all, this little bit of evidence, a great\r\n\r\ndeal of speculation, and we are asked to believe that\r\n\r\nthe  law is suspect, but is always administered  with\r\n\r\nscrupulous   fairness,  impartiality;  and   absolute\r\n\r\njustice is done in the end even though we the  people\r\n\r\nknow nothing about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could go on and then I would be accused at\r\n\r\nthe end of it of having made another election speech.\r\n\r\nBut  let me tell the hon. Members on this side of the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  when  we  come here  we  make  the  same\r\n\r\nspeeches,  we say the same things that we  have  said\r\n\r\noutside. We have no two sets of speeches, no two sets\r\n\r\nof  values. We do not go and tell the people  outside\r\n\r\nsomething  and come here and say, \"Well,  after  all,\r\n\r\nthat has diddled them. We will do something different\r\n\r\nnow.\"  We are honest politicians, and we say what  we\r\n\r\nfeel, honestly and fearlessly. I think myself that if\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Minister allows himself to be overwhelmed\r\n\r\nby  the  susceptibilities of the minorities  whom  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  like to ride roughshod over  because  they\r\n\r\nhave,  after all, susceptibilities, and because  they\r\n\r\ndo  not like public meetings after seven and are very\r\n\r\nunhappy  about it, we have got to take  note  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that they are very unhappy and submit to  their\r\n\r\nsusceptibilities for the time being. If that  is  the\r\n\r\npoint of view of a very brave man,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  came  out  and fought on a very brave  platform,\r\n\r\nthen  if  at the end of three months, again he  takes\r\n\r\nnote  of  the  susceptibilities of this minority,  we\r\n\r\nshall  have  to revise, and I think the  public  will\r\n\r\nalso have to revise, very seriously the estimation of\r\n\r\nthe worth of the people who made those promises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Secretary has given the\r\n\r\nstatistics  of all the people who have been  arrested\r\n\r\nfor  all the evil things that they have done. If they\r\n\r\nhave  done  these evil things, let them not  just  be\r\n\r\ndetained - let them hang for it. That is the  stand  of\r\n\r\nthe  People's Action Party. We are asked  to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  no abuse whatsoever. Of  course  the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary was careful. He confined himself  to\r\n\r\nrecent  months, and no doubt their conduct in  recent\r\n\r\nmonths must have been very much affected by the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  there  were these coming elections,  and  there\r\n\r\nwould  be such an occasion as this. But outside those\r\n\r\nrecent  months, I myself was engaged  in  one  matter\r\n\r\nwhere several Malays were charged with murder because\r\n\r\none December day the Malays decided to let themselves\r\n\r\ngo  and  get their own back on society. The only  way\r\n\r\nthey knew how to get their own back on society was to\r\n\r\nget at every white man they could get their hands  on\r\n\r\nand  beat him up; and they killed one R.A.F. sergeant\r\n\r\nwho  never  did  anybody any wrong.  But  they  never\r\n\r\nproved  it. The jury said they never killed him,  and\r\n\r\nthe Judge acquitted them, and they were going to come\r\n\r\nout of the dock to express their relief when a police\r\n\r\nofficer  calmly took them by the arms and said,  \"Off\r\n\r\nyou  go!\",  and  I was informed that  they  had  been\r\n\r\ndetained under the Emergency Regulations. Again,  the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary referred to the seven  cases,  where\r\n\r\nthey  were  all  proved in open court  to  have  been\r\n\r\nguilty of crimes of violence or subversion. But there\r\n\r\nwas one case, I\r\n\r\nremember, where the jury refused to convict  and  the\r\n\r\nman left the dock to go back to prison or a place  of\r\n\r\ndetention under the Emergency Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all concerned that there should be this state of terror and fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  are keenly interested, more interested than those\r\n\r\nwho  do not have their homes here, and have somewhere\r\n\r\nelse  a  comfortable  home to retire  to,  that  this\r\n\r\nproblem must be solved. But we do not believe that it\r\n\r\ncan  be  solved  as  a military operation.  Give  the\r\n\r\nPolice  the  powers, give them the guns,  and  starve\r\n\r\nthem  out.  That will solve it! It is not a  military\r\n\r\nproblem and cannot be solved in that way. It is  part\r\n\r\nof  a  political discontent, which has its  basis  on\r\n\r\nsocial and economic conditions - (as the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nwould   have   said) - bitterness   which   finds   one\r\n\r\nmanifestation  in  this  particular  form  of  revolt\r\n\r\nagainst   the   system.   Repealing   the   Emergency\r\n\r\nRegulations  would not solve this  problem,  and  not\r\n\r\nrepealing  the Emergency Regulations would  also  not\r\n\r\nsolve  this problem. If we are ever to solve it,  let\r\n\r\nus  have the courage to say, \"We believe in democracy\r\n\r\nand  we  are going to fight for it. We give you  this\r\n\r\ndemocracy  to  fight for.\" If we then fail,  then  we\r\n\r\nwould  have to admit, as the French admitted in Indo-China, that nothing can succeed. It is very difficult\r\n\r\nto  talk in terms of unemotive language of what  this\r\n\r\nrevolt   really   signifies.  It  is   part   of   an\r\n\r\ninternational   revolution;  it   is   part   of   an\r\n\r\ninternational conspiracy. It is a campaign of terror.\r\n\r\nBut  there are also other facets to this problem, and\r\n\r\na big facet is the fact that there are people who are\r\n\r\nfinally  forced  to  resort to such  a  technique  of\r\n\r\nrevolt.  They are the people who have no place  under\r\n\r\nthe sun in this society. It is curious that there are\r\n\r\nvery  few  who  come from the relatively  comfortable\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking  classes, but there  are  relatively\r\n\r\nmany  who  come from the less fortunate elements  and\r\n\r\nclasses of society that the Chief Minister so vividly\r\n\r\ndescribed yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that if we ever hope to build an\r\n\r\nindependent democratic Malaya, we must put our  faith\r\n\r\nin that independence and that democracy and fight for\r\n\r\nit. You cannot fight it just as a military operation.\r\n\r\nYou  cannot squash this thing as you would  squash  a\r\n\r\nsquib  or  cracker, or a cannon, or an atom  bomb  by\r\n\r\ndeadening the fuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  are,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, dealing  with  a  human\r\n\r\nproblem,  a  problem with which  all  areas  in  this\r\n\r\nworld,  where  there  are acute economic  and  social\r\n\r\nconditions, have somehow or the other got  themselves\r\n\r\nentangled. In my submission we should take  one  step\r\n\r\nforward  in  this  attempt  to  let  democracy  work,\r\n\r\nbelieve in it and fight for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister has said that he wanted stones to\r\n\r\nbe thrown at him and he would build houses with them.\r\n\r\nWe  hope  his Minister for Housing would not have  to\r\n\r\ndepend on such resources. But he somehow took offence\r\n\r\nat  what  he  thought were mud-pies. It  is  so  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  when  you have not got  a  jury,  and  the\r\n\r\npersons who say they are mud-pies are the persons  at\r\n\r\nwhom  the  stones are thrown. Whether the  criticisms\r\n\r\nare  constructive or not quite so constructive is,  I\r\n\r\nthink,   a  matter  most  delicate  for  the   person\r\n\r\ncriticized to balance. But the People's Action Party,\r\n\r\nand  I  think he will agree, could throw him  a  nice\r\n\r\nbig,  hefty  stone. But we will give him these  three\r\n\r\nmonths.  We  hope  and pray that  he  will  have  the\r\n\r\ncourage,  not just to speak democracy,  but  to  live\r\n\r\ndemocracy and give it to the people. If at the end of\r\n\r\nthe  three  months  the Chief Secretary's  persuasive\r\n\r\npowers  have been more powerful than our very tenuous\r\n\r\nmoral  influence  on his mode of  conduct  in  public\r\n\r\noffice, then I would very much hate to see the Labour\r\n\r\nFront go the way the Progressives have gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people are not destructive. They do not want\r\n\r\nruination.  It is they who sent back the  Parties  on\r\n\r\ntheir pledge to repeal, or to revoke, or to amend the\r\n\r\nEmergency   Regulations.  There  must  be   a   basic\r\n\r\ndiscontent  with  the way in which their  lives  have\r\n\r\nbeen affected by these Regulations. It is useless  to\r\n\r\ncome  to  this  Chamber and tell a  very  interesting\r\n\r\nstory,  unravelling excellent police  investigations,\r\n\r\nand  to hope thereby that all the opposition that has\r\n\r\nbeen  brewing over seven years can be quelled. It  is\r\n\r\nthe  duty of the Chief Minister to be responsible  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  I  hope he will not forget  that  he  is\r\n\r\nresponsible to the people who put\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhim there to do certain things they wanted him to do.\r\n\r\nThe way in which withdrawals are made is a matter  of\r\n\r\ngrave  concern.  For instance, when  he  opened  this\r\n\r\nmotion, if one could close one's eyes and forget  the\r\n\r\nskilful  delivery  and just take  the  substance,  it\r\n\r\nmight  have  been his defeated opponent in  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nwho  talked so eloquently about the virtues  of  this\r\n\r\nconstitution. Here we were all together, five elected\r\n\r\nmen,  one  nominated, and three Government  men.  \"We\r\n\r\nwere  all a team, we worked together for freedom.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  worked so magnificently that we might  not\r\n\r\neven  need a change for quite some time.\" But let  me\r\n\r\nremind the Chief Minister that that was not-.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

Members. I would like to invite the attention\r\n\r\nof  hon. Members firstly to Sessional Papers No. Cmd.\r\n\r\n1 and No. Cmd. 2 which were tabled at this sitting of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Paper, No. Cmd. 1 of 1955, contains a\r\n\r\nSchedule  of applications for supplementary provision\r\n\r\nwhich  were  unanimously recommended for approval  by\r\n\r\nthe  Standing Committee on Finance of the Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil and in respect of which Special Warrants were\r\n\r\nissued in accordance with established practice before\r\n\r\nthe dissolution of the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second Paper, No. Cmd. 2 of 1955, contains a\r\n\r\nlist of applications for supplementary expenditure of\r\n\r\nan   urgent  nature  which  were  approved   by   His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the  Governor and  in  respect  of  which\r\n\r\nSpecial  Warrants were issued during  the  period  of\r\n\r\ninterregnum   between   the   dissolution   of    the\r\n\r\nLegislative   Council  and  the   election   of   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to give a\r\n\r\nbrief  explanation to hon. Members of  the  procedure\r\n\r\nwhich   we   hope   to  follow  in  connection   with\r\n\r\napplications  for  supplementary  provision  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly.   Throughout  the   year   we   receive   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable number of applications for supplementary\r\n\r\nprovision. These represent services which  could  not\r\n\r\nbe foreseen when the annual estimates were framed and\r\n\r\nwhich are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso important and urgent that they cannot be postponed\r\n\r\nuntil  the estimates for the next year are drawn  up.\r\n\r\nThese   applications  come  to  the   Treasury   from\r\n\r\ndepartments and are scrutinised with great  care.  If\r\n\r\nthey are considered essential in the interests of the\r\n\r\npublic  service,  they  are put  to  the  Council  of\r\n\r\nMinisters  and, if they are approved by the  Council,\r\n\r\npresented  to this Assembly. We intend to  accumulate\r\n\r\nthese  applications for supplementary vote  until  we\r\n\r\nget a sufficient number to make up a Schedule such as\r\n\r\nhas been laid on the Table of this Assembly today. We\r\n\r\nhope,  if possible, to limit these Schedules to  four\r\n\r\nin a financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these Schedules are prepared, they will be laid\r\n\r\non  the  Table  of this Assembly, and at  the  first\r\n\r\nopportunity after that, the Financial Secretary  will\r\n\r\nmove  that  this  Assembly  approves  that  the  sums\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  the  Schedule  be  approved  for   the\r\n\r\npurposes  of the government. Hon. Members  will  then\r\n\r\nhave  an  opportunity  to  debate  the  motion,   and\r\n\r\nsubsequently  when  the motion is  approved,  Special\r\n\r\nWarrants  will be issued and the amounts  covered  by\r\n\r\nthese  Warrants will be included in the Supplementary\r\n\r\nAppropriation  Bill which will be  presented  to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  at the end of the financial year.  That  is\r\n\r\nthe  procedure  which  we  hope  to  follow  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  and  it  is based on sound  constitutional\r\n\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if I may, I move, with the authority of\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Governor,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of $800,344\r\n\r\nshould be supplied to the Government under the  Heads\r\n\r\nof  Expenditure  and  for the services  specified  in\r\n\r\nSessional Paper No. Cmd. 3 of 1955 laid on the  Table\r\n\r\nof the Assembly this 26th day of April, 1955.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The  salaries\r\n\r\nattached to these appointments were upgraded  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  of 1955, but on re-examination after  that\r\n\r\ndate,  the  conclusion was reached that  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nduties  and  responsibilities of the posts  had  been\r\n\r\nover-rated  at the salaries stated in the  Estimates.\r\n\r\nWe  consequently  seek  authority  to  downgrade  the\r\n\r\nsalaries to a level commensurate with the duties  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of the posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next item, No. 63, seeks provision for projection equipment and\r\n\r\naccessories  for  the  Films  Censor's  Office.  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  are aware that all films which are shown  to\r\n\r\nthe  public  in  Singapore must be  examined  by  the\r\n\r\nCensor.  During  the  last 18  months  to  two  years\r\n\r\nnumerous  new  techniques  of  film  projection  have\r\n\r\nappeared  on  the  market. The Film Censor  has  been\r\n\r\nreluctant  to ask for provision for the new equipment\r\n\r\nuntil  it  was  quite  certain  which  of  these  new\r\n\r\ntechniques were going to be permanent. It now appears\r\n\r\nthat  those techniques which use a wider screen  will\r\n\r\nbe  permanent, and consequently he seeks provision to\r\n\r\npurchase the necessary equipment to view these films.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third item, No. 64, seeks provision for the\r\n\r\nlegal  fees  in connection with the drafting  of  new\r\n\r\nlegislation for the registration of title to land  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Yesterday my hon. Friend the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLocal  Government (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji  Jumat)\r\n\r\ndrew attention to the fact that this Government hoped\r\n\r\nto introduce new legislation for registration of land\r\n\r\ntitles  based  on the Torrens system.  Attempts  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made in the past to draft legislation  on  this\r\n\r\nbasis without\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuccess. Recently, however, we have been fortunate in\r\n\r\nbeing  able  to  obtain the services of  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nleading authority in Australia on the Torrens  system\r\n\r\nof  land  tenure. He and his colleagues  in  Chambers\r\n\r\nhave  drafted  a Bill which is now in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthis  fee  is  required  to remunerate  him  for  his\r\n\r\nservices. I should say that the fee includes the cost\r\n\r\nof  his  appearing before any Select Committee  which\r\n\r\nmay  be set up by this Assembly to consider the Bill,\r\n\r\nand,  if  necessary,  before  the  Bar  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth item, No. 65, seeks provision for the\r\n\r\nupkeep  of  the  Speaker's  house  and  grounds.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker's residence is one of the official residences\r\n\r\nof  Government, and it is necessary that it  and  its\r\n\r\ngrounds  be upkept appropriately. Most unfortunately\r\n\r\nthis  provision  was omitted from the Estimates  when\r\n\r\nthey were drafted in 1954.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth item, No. 66, seeks provision for the\r\n\r\nsalaries   of   Ministers-the  Chief   Minister   and\r\n\r\nMinisters - for  the remainder of this year.  You  will\r\n\r\nsee  from  the Schedule that it is proposed that  the\r\n\r\nChief  Minister should be paid $3,500  a  month,  and\r\n\r\nthat the Ministers should be paid $2,500 a month, and\r\n\r\nthe  Assistant Minister $1,500 a month. In  addition,\r\n\r\nthey  will, of course, draw the stipends paid to them\r\n\r\nas  Members  of  this  Assembly. These  salaries  and\r\n\r\nstipends  have been considered with very great  care,\r\n\r\nand  I  feel  myself  that  they  are  no  more  than\r\n\r\nadequate,  having regard to the nature of the  duties\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Ministers have to discharge  and  to  the\r\n\r\ngreat responsibilities which they have to bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth item, No. 67, seeks provision for\r\n\r\nsalaries, wages and equipment of the Flood Prevention\r\n\r\nInvestigation  Unit. Hon. Members  will  recall  that\r\n\r\nafter the disastrous floods in December of last  year\r\n\r\nit  was  decided to recruit the services of an expert\r\n\r\nto  examine the whole question of floods in Singapore\r\n\r\nIsland   and  to  make  recommendations   for   their\r\n\r\nprevention,  or at least their alleviation.  We  were\r\n\r\nfortunate   to   get  the  services  of   the   Chief\r\n\r\nConstruction Engineer of the Drainage and  Irrigation\r\n\r\nDepartment in the Federation on secondment, who is an\r\n\r\nexpert\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin these matters.

The present  wireless\r\n\r\nsets  used by the Military security forces are  field\r\n\r\nequipment  which  are in certain respects  unsuitable\r\n\r\nfor  use  in built-up areas, certainly built-up  city\r\n\r\nareas.  Domestic  appliances, neon  lights,  trolley-buses  and  industrial plant cause  such  disturbance\r\n\r\nthat  these  sets  are unsuitable,  and  enquiry  has\r\n\r\nbrought  to  light the fact that it is unlikely  that\r\n\r\nthese  forces will be issued with equipment  suitable\r\n\r\nfor  use in built-up areas for some time to come. The\r\n\r\nArmy   have  therefore  asked  us  to  purchase   the\r\n\r\nequipment on their behalf and lend it to them for use\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. We propose to do this and it has  been\r\n\r\nagreed  that  the  Army will pay a satisfactory  rent\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be sufficient to amortize the  equipment\r\n\r\npurchased well within its useful life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item No. 69 seeks provision for the purchase of a\r\n\r\nteleprinter  switchboard at Police Headquarters.  The\r\n\r\nexisting    teleprinter   switchboard    at    Police\r\n\r\nHeadquarters contains provision for 30 lines; 24  are\r\n\r\nat  present used, the other six will be used  in  the\r\n\r\nvery near future. Having regard to the development of\r\n\r\npolice communications, it is quite clear now that  an\r\n\r\nextension  will  be required for the  switchboard.  A\r\n\r\nswitchboard  takes a year to build. It  is  desirable\r\n\r\nthat it should be ordered now, and we feel that if  a\r\n\r\nswitchboard   containing  30  additional   lines   is\r\n\r\nordered,   it   will  be  sufficient  for   all   new\r\n\r\nrequirements of the police for some time to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last item, No. 70, seeks provision for the\r\n\r\npurchase  of very high frequency radio equipment  for\r\n\r\nPolice  Headquarters.

During the recess -  and\r\n\r\nit was wisely suggested by the Chief Minister that we\r\n\r\nought  to have a recess - we discussed this item.  This\r\n\r\nafternoon  I had a little jibe at the Chief  Minister\r\n\r\nabout  his  coolie and labourer, income for  whom  he\r\n\r\nshould  think  about when he thinks of this  princely\r\n\r\nsalary   that   he  might  be  getting.   But   after\r\n\r\nconsideration during the recess, we find that he  has\r\n\r\nmade  a  considerable  sacrifice  in  his  income  by\r\n\r\naccepting  this salary. Even the P.A.P. leader  (Mr\r\n\r\nLee  Kuan  Yew) went so far as to say that  he  would\r\n\r\nlike to increase - [Interruption.] - and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister said, \"I am quite satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, further discussion arose. I might tell the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  only  two days ago we  had  an  informal\r\n\r\nmeeting  of  the  would-be  Trade  Advisory  Council,\r\n\r\nrepresenting   Chambers   of   Commerce   and   other\r\n\r\ninterested  business, and they were of the  unanimous\r\n\r\nopinion  that  the  Minister  for  Commerce  and  the\r\n\r\nAssistant Minister to him have very responsible  jobs\r\n\r\nand  that  they should not be engaged in any  private\r\n\r\nvocation.  That  was the unanimous decision.  In  the\r\n\r\nHouse  after enquiry I find from the Government  side\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  no  private  interests  or  private\r\n\r\nvocations   for   the   Assistant   Minister.    Now,\r\n\r\nconsidering this, the Assistant Minister's salary  is\r\n\r\nrather  low. It is a full-time job, Sir, and I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to say, with the concurrence of my friends over\r\n\r\nhere  on my side, that it should be raised to $2,000.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether I could move an amendment. I do\r\n\r\nnot know, but that is my expression of opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am advised that we can delete this $1,500 and\r\n\r\nmake  it  $2,000.

Mr R.\r\n\r\nJumabhoy   that  we  will  note  his  suggestion   in\r\n\r\nconnection with the salary of the Assistant  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question which has been raised on\r\n\r\nitem No. 64, I appreciate that in all probability the\r\n\r\nsum  of  $20,000  appears,  prima  facie,  to  be   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable sum. On the other hand, it must be borne\r\n\r\nin  mind  that the gentleman who has assisted  us  in\r\n\r\nthis matter is the leading authority in Australia  on\r\n\r\nthe   Torrens   system  of  land  tenure   and   land\r\n\r\nregistration.  We have made enquiries in  Sydney  and\r\n\r\nare  given to understand that this fee of $20,000  is\r\n\r\nnot  out of the way, having regard to fees which  are\r\n\r\npaid  to  leading  counsel  at  the  Australian  Bar.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would point out that this fee  is  not\r\n\r\npaid  for the services of one man alone. It  is  paid\r\n\r\nnot only to him but to the assistants in his Chambers\r\n\r\nwho  helped him to draft the Bill. Also I would point\r\n\r\nout  that  this  Bill  is  not  a  simple  matter  of\r\n\r\ndrafting.  It  is a piece of complicated  legislation\r\n\r\nwhich endeavours to incorporate the best features  of\r\n\r\nthe  Torrens system of land registration in Australia\r\n\r\nand  New Zealand and in the Federation of Malaya, and\r\n\r\nat  the  same time to introduce the best features  of\r\n\r\nland  registration  in  the United  Kingdom,  and  to\r\n\r\nmodify  them  all  in accordance with  the  needs  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I myself raised this question  about  the\r\n\r\nsuitability of a fee, and I can say, after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexamination,  in my capacity as Financial  Secretary,\r\n\r\nthat I am satisfied that the fee is suitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the explanation given by the Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary, but I think it  would  be  more\r\n\r\nappropriate,  since  no  definite  figure  could   be\r\n\r\narrived  at,  that a token vote be  included  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates.

It refers to renewal of locks  in  the\r\n\r\nlocal prison which costs $97,438. It really surprises\r\n\r\nme, Sir, that the renewal of locks would cost such  a\r\n\r\nheavy  amount  as this. I wonder if those  locks  are\r\n\r\nmade  of gold or so forth, and, if not, I would  like\r\n\r\nan  explanation from the Hon. the Financial Secretary\r\n\r\ntelling  us  why it costs so much for the renewal  of\r\n\r\nlocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

The\r\n\r\nexisting locks were put into the prison, or put  into\r\n\r\nthe  doors of the cells in the prison, and  to  other\r\n\r\ndoors   in  the  prison  80  years  ago.  They   were\r\n\r\nconsiderably  tampered with during the  time  of  the\r\n\r\nJapanese   occupation,  and  at   the   moment   they\r\n\r\nconstitute  a security risk. Not only is it  possible\r\n\r\nfor  prisoners to pick the locks and get out.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso   on   some   occasions   impossible   for   the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent to get the prisoners out of the cells.\r\n\r\nI  may  say  in  this connection that we  employed  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the famous firm of Chubb  who  came\r\n\r\nout\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  the United Kingdom, made an examination of  the\r\n\r\nlocks  in the Outram Road jail, and on his advice  we\r\n\r\nplaced  an  order for them. Again, I may say  that  I\r\n\r\nregard the sum as a reasonable figure for the service\r\n\r\nbeing performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid I\r\n\r\nshould  have risen earlier had I known the  procedure\r\n\r\nthat  would be adopted, because I would like to refer\r\n\r\nto   item   No.  66  (Salaries  of  the  Council   of\r\n\r\nMinisters).  Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the  Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister will be delighted this evening to know\r\n\r\nthat the People's Action Party takes a very high view\r\n\r\nof  his attitude, his sense of self-sacrifice, and we\r\n\r\nsay,  without any condescension whatsoever, that  the\r\n\r\nfigures  that  have  been submitted  are  modest  and\r\n\r\nmoderate.  I  am  made to understand that  the  other\r\n\r\nMinisters  are  getting  less than  the  professional\r\n\r\nadministrators who are Ministers in this House. That,\r\n\r\nin  my opinion, is not a proper state of affairs, for\r\n\r\nit  must  never  be forgotten that  whilst  they  are\r\n\r\nperforming the same duties and undertaking  the  same\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, they do not, in  the  first  place,\r\n\r\nhave the same perquisites of office like a Government\r\n\r\nhouse,  Government  quarters at a sub-economic  rent;\r\n\r\nand  what  is more important is that they, more  than\r\n\r\nthe professional administrators, face the hazards  of\r\n\r\na  political  life. In my opinion, this is  a  useful\r\n\r\nstage to consider what they ought to be getting,  not\r\n\r\nnow,  but  for many years to come, because  once  the\r\n\r\npoint is fixed, it would be an invidious task for any\r\n\r\nsucceeding government to try in any way to change it.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  there could be a lot of  mock  hypocrisy\r\n\r\nabout  this - we have come to serve the people.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot want money, and as proof of the fact that we want\r\n\r\nto  serve  the people, we are prepared to  take  very\r\n\r\nlittle  for  it.  But I think we  ought  to  be  more\r\n\r\nrealistic about it and face the facts. By the time  a\r\n\r\nman is doing that job, by the time that confidence is\r\n\r\nreposed  in  him by the public and by the Party  that\r\n\r\nhas a majority in this House, he ought to be given an\r\n\r\nemolument adequate to his position. And a situation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere a Minister gets somewhat less all-round than  a\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretary who is supposed to be  assisting\r\n\r\nhim in the functions of his Ministry is, I think, not\r\n\r\na healthy one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to make full amends. Members of the\r\n\r\nBar  will  realise that. Two Ministers have given  up\r\n\r\ntheir  practices and I think it is impossible for  us\r\n\r\nto  compensate  them for what they  were  getting  in\r\n\r\nprivate  practice.  To  that  extent  there  is   the\r\n\r\ninevitable sacrifice. We must face the fact  that  if\r\n\r\nit  is  allowed  to remain as it is,  any  succeeding\r\n\r\ngovernment - be  it  Labour, Progressive,  Democrat  or\r\n\r\neven  P.A.P. - will find it extremely uncomfortable  to\r\n\r\nhave  to go back to the people and say, \"Well,  after\r\n\r\nall,  the  Labour Front did it for you very  cheaply,\r\n\r\nbut  they  did  it very badly because they  were  not\r\n\r\nproperly paid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one should remember that there is not very\r\n\r\nmuch  really  involved in it except the  question  of\r\n\r\nprestige  and  principle, because  the  total  amount\r\n\r\ninvolved  to the country is very little. One  bridge-building  mismanaged which collapses  and  costs  the\r\n\r\ncountry on rebuilding $500,000 would pay for all  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  for  the next two to three  years.  In  my\r\n\r\nopinion, there should be a suggestion taken  back  to\r\n\r\nHis    Excellency   the   Governor,   after    proper\r\n\r\nconsideration by the Council of Ministers, that  this\r\n\r\nlist  be  revised.  We appreciate the  restraint.  We\r\n\r\nappreciate also the hesitation to open the Council of\r\n\r\nMinisters to attack, but I think hon. Members on  the\r\n\r\nother  side have under-estimated the generosity,  not\r\n\r\njust  financially, but the generosity in spirit  with\r\n\r\nwhich we approached this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The\r\n\r\nHon. the Financial Secretary in mentioning this item\r\n\r\nsaid  he thought that it was no more than appropriate\r\n\r\nconsidering  the work involved, and  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  compared  it  with  what  was   being\r\n\r\nreceived  by Permanent Secretaries. I think the  true\r\n\r\napproach should be: What is adequate for a reasonably\r\n\r\nspacious  way of life for a person in that particular\r\n\r\nposition? And no more than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself feel that in this country we have learnt to\r\n\r\nlive  on too extravagant a scale, and that, in  fact,\r\n\r\n$3,500  to  the Chief Minister is pretty high.  I  am\r\n\r\nconscious that I am not married, Sir, and I  have  to\r\n\r\nlook  forward  to the possibilities of  change  where\r\n\r\nothers may be in a more difficult position. $3,500 is\r\n\r\na  great deal of money. However much more I may  have\r\n\r\nearned in the past is not the point. But the question\r\n\r\nis:  Is  it adequate for a decent way of life in  the\r\n\r\nposition  of  the Chief Minister in this  country?  I\r\n\r\nthink  the answer, Sir, from me, is yes, and  I  hope\r\n\r\nfor my successors. It is adequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not lack courage. I do not wish to seem\r\n\r\nboastful. We do not lack courage in taking unpleasant\r\n\r\nsteps,  and it was not because we feared the lack  of\r\n\r\ngenerosity  of  hon. Members in this  House  that  we\r\n\r\nplaced  our salaries at a modest scale. It is because\r\n\r\nwe  would  like,  Sir, to set a new standard,  a  new\r\n\r\noutlook, as to what is proper, and from that point of\r\n\r\nview, Sir, we have given ourselves a little too much.\r\n\r\nAnd  hon. Members will remember this: that apart from\r\n\r\nthe salaries we are getting as Ministers, we are also\r\n\r\nreceiving  emoluments  of $500  a  month  by  way  of\r\n\r\nallowances to all hon. Members here; we as Members of\r\n\r\nthe   Assembly  are  receiving  $500;  the  Assistant\r\n\r\nMinister receiving $1,500 makes it $2,000; $2,500 for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister plus $500 makes it $3,000;  $3,500  for\r\n\r\nthe Chief Minister is $4,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it has been suggested, we will certainly not\r\n\r\nonly    note,   but   bring   forward   for   further\r\n\r\nconsideration   to  the  Council  of  Ministers   the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  made by the Member for Tanjong  Pagar.  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  ought to clarify this point  of  it:  that\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretaries do not receive more, if we take\r\n\r\ninto consideration the additional $500 we receive  as\r\n\r\nMembers of the House. It is true we serve full  time,\r\n\r\nand  it  is true that there are no trade union  hours\r\n\r\nfor  Ministers.  The way to look  at  it  is:  Is  it\r\n\r\nadequate  for a reasonably spacious way of life?  And\r\n\r\nthough  there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction,\r\n\r\nadmittedly, I think that this House should  be  chary\r\n\r\nof  encouraging  extravagance in public  expenditure,\r\n\r\nand I hope that this House will set a new standard in\r\n\r\nrespect of public expenditure and public emoluments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
