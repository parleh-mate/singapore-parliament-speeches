I do not\r\n\r\nknow  why  there is a need for a further provision  of\r\n\r\n$200  million in these present Estimates. I would also\r\n\r\nlike to know what is the purpose of this $200 million.\r\n\r\nAlso,  to  what extent has the present amount  already\r\n\r\nbeen used by the Government?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy   Speaker,  Sir,  the  Member  has  asked   for\r\n\r\ninformation as to why it is necessary to transfer this\r\n\r\nlarge  sum of money from the Consolidated Fund to  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund. This is a fairly reasonable  request\r\n\r\nfor  information, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. So I  shall\r\n\r\ntry  to  enlighten  him.  There  are  two  main  funds\r\n\r\noperated   by  the  Government.  The  first   is   the\r\n\r\nConsolidated  Fund.  This is the  Fund  in  which  all\r\n\r\nrevenues of the State are kept. From this Consolidated\r\n\r\nFund  all payments of Government Departments are  paid\r\n\r\nout:   running   of  Ministries,  for  staff,   public\r\n\r\nservices,  and  all the other items of expenditure  in\r\n\r\nthe  Main  Estimates which we passed  the  day  before\r\n\r\nyesterday.  That is the Consolidated  Fund.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  it  is  a fund which deals with the  operating\r\n\r\nexpenses  of  the  Government and  keeps  the  current\r\n\r\nrevenues of the Government. In other words, it is  our\r\n\r\ncurrent account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fund is the Development Fund. All the\r\n\r\nprojects   for  capital  expenditure,  such   as   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates  which  this  Assembly   passed\r\n\r\nyesterday,  are paid out of monies of the  Development\r\n\r\nFund.  The Development Fund gets its income from three\r\n\r\nprincipal sources. The first is loans which  we  raise\r\n\r\neach year in Singapore. The second is the interest  on\r\n\r\nthe earnings of the Development Fund. The third source\r\n\r\ncomes  from allocations from the Consolidated Fund  to\r\n\r\nthe Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFund.  As  Members will know, each year sums of  money\r\n\r\nare  transferred  from the Consolidated  Fund  to  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund. The purpose of  this  item  in  the\r\n\r\nSupplementary Estimates is to transfer this amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney,  namely,  $200 million, from  the  Consolidated\r\n\r\nFund  to the Development Fund to meet expenditures  in\r\n\r\nthe  State's development plan. So the short answer  as\r\n\r\nto  what the money is going to be used for is that  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  used to pay for expenditure on the  projects\r\n\r\nwhich this Assembly approved yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why is it $200 million? If the Member will read\r\n\r\nthe  notes attached to this subhead, he will find this\r\n\r\nin  the  last  sentence:  \"The Consolidated  Fund  now\r\n\r\nstands  at  $288 million which is much  in  excess  of\r\n\r\nnormal requirements....\" Normally  we  want something like $60 million  in  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated  Fund.  That  is  quite  ample  to   meet\r\n\r\nGovernment's expenditure in its day-to-day operations.\r\n\r\nBut the Consolidated Fund has stood at this very large\r\n\r\nfigure  as  a  result  of  surpluses  accumulated   in\r\n\r\nprevious  years.  It is necessary  to  transfer  these\r\n\r\nsurpluses  in  a lump sum now. Members will  recollect\r\n\r\nthat  in  1961,  we made a transfer  of  $80  million.\r\n\r\nToday,  with a transfer of $200 million, we will  have\r\n\r\ntransferred $280 million of previous years'  surpluses\r\n\r\ninto the Development Fund. In 1959 we transferred  $20\r\n\r\nmillion  from the Consolidated Fund to the Development\r\n\r\nFund,   and  from  1960  to  1963  in  each  year   we\r\n\r\ntransferred  $30 million. So the total  of  all  these\r\n\r\nmonies  transferred from the Consolidated Fund to  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund  stands  at  something   like   $420\r\n\r\nmillion. This is the surplus which we have referred to\r\n\r\nevery  now  and then. Obviously there is no  point  in\r\n\r\nletting the money remain in the Consolidated Fund.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the Barisan Sosialis have always asked  in  the\r\n\r\nprevious Assembly why we do not spend this money.  Now\r\n\r\nwhen we are transferring this money to the Development\r\n\r\nFund,  they  say, \"Why do you want to do  this?\"  They\r\n\r\ncannot have it both ways. I hope I have explained  the\r\n\r\nmatter clearly to the Member for Choa Chu Kang. He was\r\n\r\nurging   me  yesterday  to  spend  this  money.   This\r\n\r\nexercise, among other things, will have the effect  of\r\n\r\nobliging him. I hope I have made the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition clear. There is no catch in it. I can see him\r\n\r\nfrowning.

It is unusually  short.  It  is\r\n\r\ncustomary  for the Barisan and the pro-Communist  boys\r\n\r\nto  be  very  interested in cultural activities.  They\r\n\r\nconsider   it   a   means  to  disseminate   Communist\r\n\r\npropaganda and to indoctrinate the young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Theatre project was approved at a\r\n\r\ntotal cost of $2.2 million. The cost was worked out by\r\n\r\nthe  architects  as  well as the  former  Director  of\r\n\r\nPublic Works. Government's contribution is the balance\r\n\r\nbetween  the total cost of $2.2 million and the  total\r\n\r\nsum  of  donations including interest derived thereon.\r\n\r\nThe  total amount of donations, inclusive of interest,\r\n\r\nif  the  Opposition Member is interested to  know,  is\r\n\r\n$856,279.04 as at 16th December, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has touched on the delay of\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  this National Theatre.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nappreciate  the following facts. Piling  work  on  the\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre was completed in October last  year.\r\n\r\nWork  on  the  building  contract  commenced  on  24th\r\n\r\nOctober,  1962.  The  original  target  date  for  the\r\n\r\ncompletion  was 31st May, 1963, which meant  that  the\r\n\r\nsteel contractor had to finish the steel work by  15th\r\n\r\nMay, 1963. The technical difficulties involved in  the\r\n\r\nsteel work prevented the target date from being met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another reason for the delay. The late\r\n\r\ncompletion of the level structural drawings  was  due,\r\n\r\nin a large measure, to the necessity of making careful\r\n\r\ncalculations to ensure a safer cantilever.  It  should\r\n\r\nbe noted that the contractor's efforts to complete the\r\n\r\nwork quickly are reflected in the fact that during the\r\n\r\nperiod  23rd October, 1962, to 7th August,  1963,  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  contractor spent approximately  $118,000  by\r\n\r\nway of overtime wages. And also during\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  period 7th March, 1963, to 20th July,  1963,  the\r\n\r\nsteel contractor spent approximately $38,000 by way of\r\n\r\novertime  wages. The work had to be rushed as  it  was\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  have the main building and  stage  roof\r\n\r\nready before the South-East Asia Cultural Festival  in\r\n\r\nwhich the Member for Thomson is so interested. I shall\r\n\r\nenlighten him on this later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Festival was held from 8th August, 1963, to 15th\r\n\r\nAugust,  1963. All this work for the Cultural Festival\r\n\r\nwas completed in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it should also be noted that the National\r\n\r\nTheatre is architecturally unique in South-East  Asia,\r\n\r\nperhaps in the whole of Asia. Nowhere in Asia  can  we\r\n\r\nfind  a cantilever thrust jutting out 150 feet without\r\n\r\nany  supporting columns. In a project of this  nature,\r\n\r\nundue speed in construction is not desirable. In fact,\r\n\r\nit is dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Assembly is now requested to pass this\r\n\r\nfurther  contribution of $450,000 made to the National\r\n\r\nTheatre Trust. We recall that on 24th July, 1963,  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Assembly  passed  a  first  contribution  of\r\n\r\n$500,000  to the National Theatre Trust. This request,\r\n\r\ntherefore, is the second payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member should also note that a further payment\r\n\r\nwill  have to be made in accordance with what has been\r\n\r\nagreed in respect of Government's contribution to  the\r\n\r\nTrust as mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the information of this Assembly, the\r\n\r\nNational Theatre Trust was established by an Ordinance\r\n\r\nNo. 61 of 1961 on 19th November, 1960. The Chairman of\r\n\r\nthe Trust is Mr Lee Khoon Choy. The other members are\r\n\r\nInche   Zubir  Said,  Mr  Ng  Aik  Huan,   Mr   Paul\r\n\r\nAbisheganaden, Madam Liu Hsue Ying, Mr K. P. Bhaskar,\r\n\r\nMr Liao Sung Yang, Mr Liew Yung Ho, Mr Wee Kim Wee,\r\n\r\nMr  Ang Hock Lam, and the Permanent Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture. All these are voluntary members.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Board is to manage, on behalf of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture, the National Theatre and  other\r\n\r\ntheatrical institutions placed under its management by\r\n\r\nthe Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson probably would be interested\r\n\r\nto  know  something about our South-East Asia Cultural\r\n\r\nFestival, which I earlier promised to enlighten.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  first South-East Asia Cultural Festival which  we\r\n\r\nin Singapore had the distinction of staging took place\r\n\r\nfrom  8th August, 1963, to 15th August, 1963. It  cost\r\n\r\nthe   Government  about  $311,500.  This  is  only   a\r\n\r\nprovisional figure as the accounts have not  yet  been\r\n\r\nfinalised, but it is more or less accurate.  The  gate\r\n\r\nreceipts  amounted to $52,671.03, of which  $45,220.83\r\n\r\nwas  collected  at the National Theatre and  $7,450.20\r\n\r\nwas collected at the Victoria Theatre. The net cost to\r\n\r\nGovernment was, therefore, approximately $258,829. The\r\n\r\ngate  receipts would have been much more but  for  the\r\n\r\ncomplimentary tickets issued to the artistes and other\r\n\r\nguests of participant countries. The tickets were sold\r\n\r\nat  $5, $3, $2, and $1 at the National Theatre and  $3\r\n\r\nand  $1  at  the  Victoria Theatre. The  participating\r\n\r\nmember-countries  were  Cambodia,  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,   Hong   Kong,  India,  Laos,  Pakistan,   the\r\n\r\nPhilippines,  Sabah,  Singapore,  South  Vietnam,  and\r\n\r\nThailand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Thomson may be interested to\r\n\r\nknow that his former colleague or former adviser,  the\r\n\r\nformer  strong  man in the S.A.T.U. group,  the  pro-Communist  group  of  unions,  was  one  of  the  keen\r\n\r\nsupporters  of the National Theatre. He contributed  a\r\n\r\nlot to the National Theatre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the National Theatre was intended to be a small\r\n\r\none, but because of the tremendous enthusiasm shown \r\n\r\nby  the  donors and well-wishers, we had to reconsider\r\n\r\nour  plan. The structures have to be reconsidered  and\r\n\r\nour  National  Theatre is now a  sizable  one.  I  can\r\n\r\npromise  the  Member for Thomson that it will  not  be\r\n\r\nused for staging any songs which they are now teaching\r\n\r\nthe  small children in the kindergarten classes in the\r\n\r\nrural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, we\r\n\r\nall  know that the National Theatre was opened on  the\r\n\r\n31st August this year. Yet the Parliamentary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary has said that it has not yet been completed.\r\n\r\nHe  has also referred to the Communist activities  and\r\n\r\nBarisan disturbances. I expect him to talk in  such  a\r\n\r\ntrend - accusing the Communists of interfering with the\r\n\r\nwork  so  that  the Theatre could not be completed  in\r\n\r\ntime.

We\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask whether the Government  have  been\r\n\r\nmisusing   public  funds  by  allocating   a   further\r\n\r\nprovision of $450,000. The National Theatre may appear\r\n\r\nto  be grand and beautiful on the outside, but it  may\r\n\r\nnot  be so in actual fact. If you put some zinc sheets\r\n\r\nand  have  them  painted, they too can  appear  to  be\r\n\r\npretty from the outside. But what we want is something\r\n\r\nconcrete, real, and valuable and not something that is\r\n\r\nbeautiful  superficially.  Perhaps  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  has  been  travelling all  over  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia.  That  is why he finds the National  Theatre  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  be the most beautiful in the  whole  of\r\n\r\nthis region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the provision of $450,000, the sum of\r\n\r\n$2.2  million  has already been used on  the  National\r\n\r\nTheatre. Has it not been a waste? Perhaps you can  say\r\n\r\nthe  National Theatre appears superficially to be very\r\n\r\nbeautiful. But it might be too extravagant an item  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure to spend $2.2 million just on this sort of\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre.  What  we  want  is  not  the  most\r\n\r\nbeautiful  National  Theatre in South-East  Asia,  but\r\n\r\nsomething  that is of practical use and value  to  the\r\n\r\npeople. Moreover, we would like to know whether  there\r\n\r\nhas been any waste or misuse of public money. It might\r\n\r\nbe possible that because the Ministry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCulture  wanted  to meet the completion  date  of  the\r\n\r\nNational Theatre, a certain wastage of money  or  some\r\n\r\nirregularities might have taken place. We do not know.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  concerned  can\r\n\r\nenlighten  us  on  this,  instead  of  talking   about\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would  like  to clarify certain  points.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Thomson has said the Government wasted this\r\n\r\nmoney,  which was public money. We used the  money  to\r\n\r\nbuild the National Theatre. The money, of course, came\r\n\r\nfrom the people. But it is for the good of the people.\r\n\r\nHow  can he say that this is a waste of money when  we\r\n\r\nare  not  using it for ourselves? The National Theatre\r\n\r\nhas  been  built from the contributions of members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public. Whenever there is a $100 donation, we too\r\n\r\ncontribute  an agreed amount at the ratio of  1:1.  So\r\n\r\nhow  can he say that this is a waste? The building  of\r\n\r\nthe  National Theatre has been initiated by the public\r\n\r\nthemselves,  and  for their own  use.  From  what  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Thomson has mentioned just now, it appears\r\n\r\nthat  he might be qualified to be an associate  member\r\n\r\nof  the Architects Association of Singapore. He  talks\r\n\r\nabout whether the National Theatre was a waste or  not\r\n\r\nand  whether it was beautiful or not from the outside.\r\n\r\nHe  makes  all  these  comments as  though  he  was  a\r\n\r\nqualified architect. I think the Member for Jalan Kayu\r\n\r\nis  more concerned with the style and structure of pig\r\n\r\nsties  and  chicken sheds. He might well be conversant\r\n\r\nwith  this  subject. But he and the  people  over  the\r\n\r\nother  side might not be so well conversant  with  the\r\n\r\ntrue  architecture of the National Theatre.  They  are\r\n\r\nnot experts in this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Theatre is a very big construction job\r\n\r\nand  much effort has been put in to build it.  So  all\r\n\r\nsorts of details must be taken into consideration. The\r\n\r\nsecond  reason for the delay in the completion of  the\r\n\r\nNational  Theatre is that the public's enthusiasm  and\r\n\r\nzeal has made it possible for the original plan to  be\r\n\r\nmodified and altered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Thomson has asked whether\r\n\r\nthe  National  Theatre  would  be  safe  or  would  it\r\n\r\ncollapse. I can assure him that if he were to  go  and\r\n\r\nlook  at  the National Theatre, the ceiling would  not\r\n\r\ncollapse on his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the possible malpractices committed by the\r\n\r\ncontractor,  the  Government are very  cautious  about\r\n\r\nthis  and  pay  very much attention to it.  If  he  is\r\n\r\ninterested,   I  will  ask  the  P.W.D. engineer   to\r\n\r\naccompany  him  to  the  work  site  to  inspect   the\r\n\r\nconstruction work. He can see whether there have  been\r\n\r\nmalpractices committed by the contractor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, in the past few days, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  Members have been always finding fault  with\r\n\r\nevery  plan  and  suggestion made by  the  Government.\r\n\r\nTheir motive and objectives are to sabotage and not to\r\n\r\nmake any constructive criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Member for Thomson has criticised\r\n\r\nthe  construction work of the National Theatre. He has\r\n\r\nalso accused us of having misused the $2.2 million. We\r\n\r\nknow  that the National Theatre building campaign  was\r\n\r\nlaunched  in  1959  during Loyalty Week  and  that  it\r\n\r\nreceived  the  enthusiasm and support of  the  public.\r\n\r\nEven the Barisan Sosialis and the S.A.T.U. unions also\r\n\r\ngave  enthusiatic support to it. This National Theatre\r\n\r\nhas a very great historical significance to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  In the past, the colonial  regime  was\r\n\r\nnever  able  to put up such a theatre. If the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis had been elected to power, they too would not\r\n\r\nhave  been  able to put up such a theatre.  But  today\r\n\r\nwhen   the   people   are   awakening   to   political\r\n\r\nconsciousness, the Barisan Sosialis will never be in a\r\n\r\nposition  to come to power. The National Theatre  will\r\n\r\nbe  able to fuse the cultures of the various races  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Those who have come to Singapore from abroad\r\n\r\nwill  know  that  the National Theatre  plays  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant role in creating a Malaysian culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  did not intend to speak further on this.

The Member did not know  what\r\n\r\nhe was asking for. If he is interested to know whether\r\n\r\nthe Government are throwing money away, the answer  is\r\n\r\nsimple  - N-o-  no.  Sir,  we  are  not  the  kind   of\r\n\r\ngovernment that throw our money away by putting it  in\r\n\r\nan  unprofitable investment. We calculate and consider\r\n\r\nevery  item  of expenditure and we cut the expenditure\r\n\r\nto  the bone. There is no waste. The answer is no.  It\r\n\r\nis simple. I think what the Barisan Members are really\r\n\r\nsore  at is that they cannot turn the National Theatre\r\n\r\ninto a red star theatre, where they can have Communist\r\n\r\nculture, the harvest dance, very inspiring songs  from\r\n\r\nChina,  probably  some songs from Indonesia  and  some\r\n\r\ninspiration from Aidit of Indonesia. I think  this  is\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Barisan Sosialis Members are sore  at  with\r\n\r\nthis  National  Theatre.

In coming to a contractual  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  the  contractor, there is always a deadline  and\r\n\r\nprobably the contractor finds that he cannot make  the\r\n\r\ndeadline, therefore he has to do work round the clock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another worry of his is, why should we spend more\r\n\r\nthan  $2  million  on the National  Theatre?  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore we build for a useful purpose; we  build  in\r\n\r\norder  that it can be of practical use for our people.\r\n\r\nBut,  at the same time, we want to build and see  that\r\n\r\nwe  should be proud of whatever we build. The National\r\n\r\nTheatre is something which one should be proud of,  if\r\n\r\none  embarks  on that venture. As a loyal  citizen  of\r\n\r\nthis  State  and of Malaysia, I think  one  should  be\r\n\r\nwilling  to  spend a bit more money on a project  like\r\n\r\nthe  National Theatre, so that we can embellish  it  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit more, have better fittings here and there,\r\n\r\nso  that when visitors come to Singapore, we can  say,\r\n\r\n\"Look,  this is our National Theatre.

The\r\n\r\nprovision for community centres in 1963 is $2 million.\r\n\r\nWe  must  make  careful  use of  our  meagre  national\r\n\r\nrevenue. But, as a matter of fact, the motive  of  the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment in making use of this money in this  matter\r\n\r\nis  to win support for party purposes. I would like to\r\n\r\ncite an example. If we approve this additional sum  of\r\n\r\n$1.5  million,  then  the total  amount  for  1963  in\r\n\r\nrespect of community centres will be $3.5 million. How\r\n\r\nmuch  then  is  intended to be spent on hospitals  and\r\n\r\nother   services?  We  can  clearly  see   from   this\r\n\r\ncomparison that, in spite of the P.A.P.'s slogans  and\r\n\r\npublicity   that   community  centres,   clinics   and\r\n\r\nveterinary  stations are important and useful  to  the\r\n\r\npeople, they are in fact spending less money on  these\r\n\r\nuseful  services. The Government are in fact  spending\r\n\r\nmore money on community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that more and more community\r\n\r\ncentres  are being built without any principle.  There\r\n\r\nis no justification for them. The main reason why they\r\n\r\nare  built is that the Prime Minister is going to tour\r\n\r\nthe rural areas. Many community centres seem to go  up\r\n\r\nin  those  areas where the Prime Minister is going  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  visit. But are these community centres  still\r\n\r\nopen  today? Many of them are closed now. What is  the\r\n\r\nuse  of spending such money on community centres? They\r\n\r\nserve  no  practical purpose. Many  of  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres were built in the rural areas during the  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the Prime Minister made his tour of those areas.\r\n\r\nThey  did this to show what the Government have  done.\r\n\r\nHence they would welcome the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government are going to use this $3.5\r\n\r\nmillion. But will it benefit the people living in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas? No. This money is really going to be used\r\n\r\nfor   the  benefit  of  P.A.P. supporters  and  their\r\n\r\nlackeys.  They  would be given jobs in  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres as a kind of reward for their support  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  At  the same time many people working  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity centres are receiving double wages.  On  the\r\n\r\none  hand, they are being paid as members of the staff\r\n\r\nof community centres. On the other hand, they are also\r\n\r\nbeing  paid  for  being  inoculators  in  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Unit in the rural areas. This is  not  the\r\n\r\nproper way to spend public money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also see that there is an allocation of $2.3\r\n\r\nmillion for next year which will be spent on community\r\n\r\ncentres. This is a big sum of money. If the Government\r\n\r\nwant  to  use the money for the benefit of the people,\r\n\r\nit  should  not  be  done  by  way  of  building  more\r\n\r\ncommunity centres. We should examine and consider  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  people. We should  find  out  what  is\r\n\r\nimportant  to  the people. We should see  what  useful\r\n\r\nservices  can be provided for the people in  order  to\r\n\r\nhelp them in their livelihood, especially those living\r\n\r\nin the rural areas. Many people in the rural areas who\r\n\r\nrear pigs and poultry have to borrow money in order to\r\n\r\nkeep  going. They are thus being exploited  by  money-lenders and middlemen by having to pay a high rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest.  They have no bargaining power in all  these\r\n\r\nnegotiations   and   transactions.   They   have    no\r\n\r\nalternative.  Everything is being  controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nmiddlemen  and  money-lenders. If the  Government  are\r\n\r\nreally  interested  in  the  welfare  of  the  people,\r\n\r\nespecially those in the rural areas, then they  should\r\n\r\nsee  to it that the farmers get reasonable prices  for\r\n\r\ntheir  agricultural products. Why are  the  Government\r\n\r\nnot prepared to give loans to the farmers? They should\r\n\r\nhave done this to help the farmers in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to help the farmers is to build co-\r\n\r\noperative  societies. This will help the  people.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have talked about this a few years ago. But  up\r\n\r\nto  now we have not seen any co-operative societies to\r\n\r\nhelp  the farmers. If the Government are keen to  help\r\n\r\nthe farmers, they should do something to help increase\r\n\r\nthe   productivity   of  the  farmers   and   maintain\r\n\r\nreasonable  prices of their products. They should  not\r\n\r\nbuild  community centres for the people just for show.\r\n\r\nThese  community  centres have no practical  value  at\r\n\r\nall. In fact, when we look round we can see that there\r\n\r\nare  only  P.A.P. members who are being  employed  as\r\n\r\nstaff for these community centres. This is yet another\r\n\r\ninstance which shows that the P.A.P. is making use  of\r\n\r\npublic  money to build community centres in  order  to\r\n\r\nfurther  the  interests of the Party.  These  are  the\r\n\r\nreasons why I move this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, the Member for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu Kang has raised a few questions just now.  I\r\n\r\nhave  explained  the position. The  question  concerns\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres which are likely to  be  built.  He\r\n\r\nsays that community centres are not a necessity to the\r\n\r\npeople.  We have discussed this question at length  in\r\n\r\nthe last few days. But they still want to show in this\r\n\r\nAssembly  that there is no need for community  centres\r\n\r\nin  this  State. As a matter of fact, these  community\r\n\r\ncentres are now becoming more popular to the people in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas, and even in the towns. The amount  of\r\n\r\n$1\u00bd  million  in  the Estimates is necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  community  centres  this  year.  It   is\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy to build more  community  centres\r\n\r\nand  to give more facilities to residents in the rural\r\n\r\nareas.  This  decision was taken at the end  of  1962.\r\n\r\nThis  provision  for community centres is,  therefore,\r\n\r\nentered  in the Supplementary Estimates for 1963.  The\r\n\r\nprogramme  for the building of community  centres  has\r\n\r\nalready  been  approved. According to this  programme,\r\n\r\nthe  number of standard type community centres  to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  the  rural areas will be 101. Six  standard\r\n\r\ntype  community centres have so far been built in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas.  They  are  in a  resettlement  area  in\r\n\r\nJurong,  Woodlands,  Nee Soon,  Kranji,  and  Princess\r\n\r\nElizabeth Estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain what happened last Saturday\r\n\r\nat  the Kranji Community Centre when it was officially\r\n\r\nopened  by  the  Political  Secretary  to  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, Mr Lee Khoon Choy. A number of people  have\r\n\r\ntold  me of this incident. In fact, one of the  people\r\n\r\nthat  night said that a few days before the  community\r\n\r\ncentre  was opened, a number of people went  round  to\r\n\r\nthe  villages and intimidated the residents. They said\r\n\r\nthat if the people were to attend the official opening\r\n\r\nof  the  community centre, they would be attacked  and\r\n\r\nbeaten  up. They made this threat, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nso  that  the  people  would not attend  the  official\r\n\r\nopening  of  the community centre. We  know  from  the\r\n\r\ndebate  in this Assembly who have opposed the  opening\r\n\r\nof community centres. They comprise the people sitting\r\n\r\nin front of me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey even go so far as to prevent people from going to\r\n\r\nthe  community  centres. It is in a  community  centre\r\n\r\nthat  people  can see and talk with one another.  They\r\n\r\ncan  mix  freely among themselves. In this  way,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to understand one another and  live  in\r\n\r\npeace in this country. The reason why they are opposed\r\n\r\nto  community  centres is that  they  are  afraid  the\r\n\r\ncentres  will become popular with the people. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy   they  send  their  men  into  the  villages   to\r\n\r\nintimidate  the  people not to  attend  the  community\r\n\r\ncentre at Kranji.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to return to the subject of the provision of $1.5\r\n\r\nmillion  for  the building of community  centres.  The\r\n\r\ncost  of  building  the  six standard  type  community\r\n\r\ncentres  is  $250,000. Those in the rural  areas  cost\r\n\r\n$6,000  each. Altogether, they cost $846,000. Personal\r\n\r\nemoluments for all these come to $210,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment amounts to $242,000 and expenses in\r\n\r\nconnection   with  the  community  centres   such   as\r\n\r\nelectricity  supply,  magazines  and  newspapers,  and\r\n\r\nother  equipment, amount to $220,000.  Altogether,  it\r\n\r\namounts to $1,500,000. From this expenditure,  it  can\r\n\r\nbe  seen  that  the Government have not wasted  public\r\n\r\nmoney.  Every  item of expenditure has been  accounted\r\n\r\nfor.  The  community  centre is a place  where  people\r\n\r\ngather  to  enjoy  the facilities provided  for  their\r\n\r\nbenefit  and welfare. Why must we build standard  type\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres,  which number  six  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas?  The  reason is that such centres  can  provide\r\n\r\nmore  service  to the people in larger areas  such  as\r\n\r\nKranji  and  Jurong.  They  can  also  serve  as   the\r\n\r\nheadquarters of other community centres in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many other points have been raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu Kang. He has said that members of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nare  employed in community centres. There is no  truth\r\n\r\nin  this  statement.  Mr Deputy Speaker,  anyone  can\r\n\r\napply  for  work  in  community  centres  through  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Association. In the People's Association,  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  Committee  to consider all applications.  The\r\n\r\nCommittee  takes into consideration the qualifications\r\n\r\nand experience of the applicants.

I said then that they\r\n\r\nprovide  poultry inoculation service in  the  daytime.\r\n\r\nThey  also  provide useful services to farmers,  shop-\r\n\r\nkeepers  and  hawkers, and services such  as  for  the\r\n\r\npayment  of  licence  fees.  In  general,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  they  are open all day up to 11  o'clock  at\r\n\r\nnight  to  provide  useful services.  There  are  also\r\n\r\nkindergarten  classes  provided  in  these   community\r\n\r\ncentres  which are run on proper lines, and  not  like\r\n\r\nthose  which  propagate anti-Malaysia feelings.  These\r\n\r\nclasses  are provided for the welfare and  benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Minister for\r\n\r\nSocial  Affairs  says that because  community  centres\r\n\r\nprovide  more  and better services to the  public,  it\r\n\r\nmeans  that the Barisan are afraid and therefore raise\r\n\r\nobjections. If community centres can really serve  the\r\n\r\npeople well, we will give our support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague has said just now that in the past the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have made use of community centres  as  P.A.P.\r\n\r\norganisations to further their own interests. What  we\r\n\r\nare  concerned  with  is the people's  interest.  Past\r\n\r\nevents  have  shown that the P.A.P. have  ignored  the\r\n\r\nrights  of  the people. Therefore, it is only  natural\r\n\r\nthat  their  Party branches have been avoided  by  the\r\n\r\npeople.  So  the P.A.P. have to make use of  community\r\n\r\ncentres to carry out their party activities. If  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  mistaken,  in  the past, community  centres  were\r\n\r\nknown as association centres.

I do not know whether the community\r\n\r\ncentres   are  run  by  the  P.A.P. or  the  People's\r\n\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which we are not very clear about is\r\n\r\nthis.  Not  long ago, the P.A.P. sacked many employees\r\n\r\nof  the  People's Association working in the community\r\n\r\ncentres.  Their  dismissal was not  discussed  by  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  the  People's  Association,  but  it  was\r\n\r\napproved.  As a matter of fact, the action  was  taken\r\n\r\nunder the direction of the Minister. Why did they want\r\n\r\nto  do such a thing? Does it mean that those dismissed\r\n\r\ncould not really serve the people? No. The crux of the\r\n\r\nproblem was that they could not agree with some of the\r\n\r\npolicies of the P.A.P. which tried to make use of  and\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  People's Association and  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres.  That was the reason why they were dismissed.\r\n\r\nThis  is another example of the P.A.P.'s intention  to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  community centres for their  own  party\r\n\r\nends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Can I be given two minutes to\r\n\r\nreply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Fong Kim Heng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Since there is only one minute left,\r\n\r\nthe Minister may reply in one minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nI  would like to say here that the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nare  not fools, and that is why they have elected  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  form  the government.

If the Deputy Speaker  is  of\r\n\r\nthe opinion that I should not raise those points, then\r\n\r\nI  will now mention two further points which are  more\r\n\r\nimportant. These two points have enabled the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\ncontinue with their dictatorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth point is that the P.A.P. have been using\r\n\r\nall  the propaganda machinery such as T.V., the Radio,\r\n\r\nthe  Press  for their own ends, as a result  of  which\r\n\r\nthey were elected again to be the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason is that all those who did not support\r\n\r\nP.A.P. policies and were in disagreement  with  them,\r\n\r\nincluding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublications,  literature, the  Press  and  views  and\r\n\r\nopinions, were banned, curbed or restricted, resulting\r\n\r\nin the P.A.P. coming to power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister can give us a reply to these points.\r\n\r\nI will be glad to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nafter seeing the tactics shown by the Member for  Tampines,  \r\n\r\nhe reminds me of the boy who cries over  spilt\r\n\r\nmilk.  They know that the elections are over  and  the\r\n\r\nquestions raised by the Member are old questions which\r\n\r\nhave  been  mentioned in this Assembly. He  says  that\r\n\r\nnine  days  were not enough to carry out the  election\r\n\r\ncampaign.  They  have ideas, but we also  have  ideas.\r\n\r\nWhat we know is that three months before the elections\r\n\r\nthey had already stuck up posters in all the villages.\r\n\r\nWe  came  to know of this when our candidates went  to\r\n\r\nthe  villages. The posters were already up.  If  there\r\n\r\nwere  people  who  had  more time  to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\ncampaign, then they were the people. But what  to  do?\r\n\r\nThe  people have made their decision. They  know  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are honest and have not done anything  to\r\n\r\ndamage  their  interests. Therefore, the  people  have\r\n\r\nelected  us  once again to rule the State for  another\r\n\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that a number of voters could not cast\r\n\r\ntheir  votes  because they did not  know  the  polling\r\n\r\nstations.  In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker,  we  all  know\r\n\r\nthat  before the elections were held, the voters  were\r\n\r\nasked  to  check  their  names  and  their  respective\r\n\r\npolling stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of elections, Mr Deputy Speaker, we\r\n\r\ndo  not  want to do things which are not good.  We  do\r\n\r\nthings according to the law of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the Member has mentioned is about\r\n\r\nposters. I do not understand what he means by posters.\r\n\r\nI hope he could give me the explanation once again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he says that the Prime Minister held a forum\r\n\r\nover  the  radio and television. He accuses the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  issuing threats so that the people  were\r\n\r\nafraid  to  vote  for  the other Parties.  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  in  these forums the leaders of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis also took\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npart   and  they  gave  their  own  explanations   and\r\n\r\nstatements.  But  because their explanations  were  no\r\n\r\nlonger  of value to the people, therefore, the  people\r\n\r\ncould  not  care less for them. It was not because  of\r\n\r\nthreats as stated by the Member for Tampines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also says that election agents were not allowed to\r\n\r\naccompany  the  ballot boxes to the counting  centres.\r\n\r\nBut  I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that at every polling\r\n\r\nstation after the votes were cast, the box was  sealed\r\n\r\nby the officers because it was feared that these boxes\r\n\r\nmight  be  opened and the ballot papers  damaged.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis agents themselves saw that the  seals\r\n\r\nwere  not  broken. Therefore, there was no opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  the Government, as has been accused by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Tampines, to damage the ballot papers and boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to reply to the question of citizenship\r\n\r\nbecause it has no connection with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the P.A.P.'s use of propaganda through the use\r\n\r\nof  television  and radio, I have already  replied  to\r\n\r\nthis.  Not  only did the P.A.P. leaders take  part  in\r\n\r\nthese forums and radio talks before the elections, but\r\n\r\nthe leaders of the Barisan Sosialis also took part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to those who had been arrested before the\r\n\r\nelections,   this   had   not   been   done    without\r\n\r\nconsideration. Mr Deputy Speaker, these  leaders  had\r\n\r\nbeen  working  against the security of  this  country.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  they were arrested.

The period was too short for the Opposition\r\n\r\nto   prepare  them.  The  Government  obstructed   and\r\n\r\nprevented  us  from printing our propaganda  material.\r\n\r\nThe   period   given   to  the  Opposition   for   the\r\n\r\nelectioneering campaign was too short. Even the Tunku,\r\n\r\nwhom  they respect so much, and who is a close  friend\r\n\r\nof the M.C.A., was of the same opinion. The Tunku said\r\n\r\nthat  he had never heard of such a short period  given\r\n\r\nto  an  electioneering campaign. With  regard  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral election, the conditions were unfavourable  to\r\n\r\nthe Opposition Parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government also denied us the opportunity\r\n\r\nfor   any   publicity.  Thus,  through   intimidation,\r\n\r\ncoercion  and  suppression, the P.A.P. have  come  to\r\n\r\npower  again. They are now in a position  to  ask  for\r\n\r\nmore funds to carry out their own intentions again. I,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  say  that it is most undemocratic  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the  P.A.P. to have resorted to intimidation\r\n\r\nand coercion of the people. The Government may now  be\r\n\r\nelated  that they have won the elections, and that  we\r\n\r\nhave  lost  the elections. But I should say  that,  in\r\n\r\nspite  of their suppression and intimidation and  even\r\n\r\nunder  their  white terror, the people still  gave  us\r\n\r\n200,000 odd votes. They should not think that all  the\r\n\r\npeople supported them when they came to office.  There\r\n\r\nis  80  per cent support for them. But they  must  not\r\n\r\nforget that even Ngo Dinh Diem anti Madam Ngo received\r\n\r\n99.9  per cent of votes of the people who voted  them.\r\n\r\nYet  they  were notorious throughout the  world.  They\r\n\r\nwere the two people who suppressed the people of South\r\n\r\nVietnam. What is there for the P.A.P. to boast  about?\r\n\r\nIf the P.A.P. think they wish to emulate Ngo Dinh Diem\r\n\r\nand  Madam Ngo, then I am afraid their future will  he\r\n\r\njust  the same as theirs.

He\r\n\r\ndid  not  say whether the expenditure on the  Military\r\n\r\nForces was before or after 16th September, 1963. If he\r\n\r\nsaid  that the sum was incurred before 16th September,\r\n\r\n1963, then I say the Government was right in doing so.\r\n\r\nBut  the Government have no right to do so after  16th\r\n\r\nSeptember,  1963. The Minister said that  the  British\r\n\r\nForces stationed in Singapore are meant to protect us.\r\n\r\nSince there are British Forces here to protect us, why\r\n\r\nshould there be a need for a Singapore Military Force?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong) (In</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Mandarin):</b> Does the Member for Bukit Panjang mean that\r\n\r\nwhen  the  British Forces go away, then the Indonesian\r\n\r\nForces  would move in?

Do they  hope  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians would invade by the front door or the back\r\n\r\ndoor?  No  matter how they propagandise  to  fool  the\r\n\r\npeople, the people will not listen to them in the end.\r\n\r\nThey can also talk of Ngo Dinh Diem and Madam Ngo Dinh\r\n\r\nNhu. If we were like Ngo Dinh Diem, then we would  not\r\n\r\nsee  them  any  more in this House.  They  might  even\r\n\r\nexpect an accident any time they walk on the road. But\r\n\r\nnow  some  of  them  are  at liberty  to  walk  around\r\n\r\nSingapore  in safety. This shows that if we were  like\r\n\r\nNgo Dinh Diem, they would not have this liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their speeches only go to show that they have been\r\n\r\ndefeated  in all respects and are not able to persuade\r\n\r\nthe people into believing them. There is only one hope\r\n\r\nfor  them,  that is, when Indonesia sends  her  troops\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore to frustrate the will  of  the  people\r\n\r\nhere. Therefore, through military might and force they\r\n\r\nhope  in  the end that their friends in gaol  will  be\r\n\r\nreleased  and  eventually ride over the heads  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.

In\r\n\r\nresettling  the dwellers in the Toa Payoh area  before\r\n\r\nthe  scheme starts, I hope the Government will  modify\r\n\r\nthe  compensation rate and announce it to the  people,\r\n\r\nand  also to announce how the resettlement schemes are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  carried out, because there are  various\r\n\r\neconomic  activities in the Toa Payoh area. There  are\r\n\r\nfarmers,    shopkeepers,   handicraft   workers    and\r\n\r\nhorticulturists. Their economic activities are diverse\r\n\r\nin  nature.  If  the  Government  pay  them  the  same\r\n\r\ncompensation  rate,  then it  will  create  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nproblems. The Government's attitude should be flexible\r\n\r\nand  not  adhere strictly to the laws and regulations,\r\n\r\nand  pay $200 as compensation to the florists and  the\r\n\r\nhorticulturists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Government should consider the\r\n\r\nproblem that if these people are resettled on a  piece\r\n\r\nof  land  which is not fertile, the Government  should\r\n\r\nthink  of other ways to help them. They should provide\r\n\r\nalternative  employment.  The  compensation  must   be\r\n\r\nadequate  in  order  to ensure  that  they  can  start\r\n\r\nafresh. I do not intend to elaborate on the conditions\r\n\r\nof  compensation.  Before they start resettling  these\r\n\r\npeople,  they  should improve the  resettlement  area,\r\n\r\nthat is, that a supply of water should be provided for\r\n\r\nthose  areas and that the Government should  see  that\r\n\r\nthe  land  should be suitable for farming. In  certain\r\n\r\nresettlement areas the soil is so poor that the farmer\r\n\r\ncannot  cultivate anything. Therefore, the area chosen\r\n\r\nfor  resettlement  must be fertile  and  suitable  for\r\n\r\nfarming so as to enable the farmers to carry on  their\r\n\r\nfarming  activities. I would just  like  to  ask  this\r\n\r\nquestion  and I hope the Government would  give  me  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, if the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Choa Chu Kang reads subhead 1 (2)  he  will\r\n\r\nunderstand  why the Government ask for the  additional\r\n\r\nprovision  of $408,000.

Everybody knows that the opposite pro-Communist\r\n\r\nBarisan  Members have instigated the settlers  in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  not  to co-operate with the Government  in  the\r\n\r\nresettlement  scheme. When the project  was  launched,\r\n\r\nthey    unreasonably   obstructed   the   Government's\r\n\r\nresettlement plan. The Government plan to develop  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh.  This  will be carried Out in  several  stages.\r\n\r\nThen   the   pro-Communist  elements  instigated   the\r\n\r\nresidents not to co-operate with the Government and to\r\n\r\nrefuse  the  Government's  compensation  terms.  Their\r\n\r\nmotive is to obstruct the Government's plan to develop\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh into a satellite town. Everybody knows that\r\n\r\nthe  Toa  Payoh  plan  is to  make  it  into  a  first\r\n\r\nsatellite town comprising about 600 acres of land  and\r\n\r\n250,000  people  who can be accommodated  there.  This\r\n\r\nplan cannot be stopped just because of the instigation\r\n\r\nand  the activities of the pro-Communist Barisan.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment will bring better livelihood for the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  They  also have a  plan  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndemands  of  the  people  in the  face  of  the  rapid\r\n\r\nincrease of population in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chio Cheng Thun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chio Cheng Thun</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I do\r\n\r\nnot  like  the  Parliamentary Secretary  who,  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse   of  his  speech,  mentioned  again  Communist\r\n\r\ninstigation.  What I said was that if  the  Government\r\n\r\nhad  given them adequate compensation, then who  would\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  remove? Who wants to stay in  an  attap\r\n\r\nhouse  and  not want to move into a modern  structure?\r\n\r\nYou  think  they  do  not want to move  into  an  air-conditioned house but prefer to stay in a  dirty  hut?\r\n\r\nThe  question is that these people do not have  money.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot remove because the compensation given  by\r\n\r\nthe Government is not reasonable. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development has also  told  us\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government want to revise the  compensation\r\n\r\nrate,  which  shows  that the  rate  as  in  force  is\r\n\r\nunreasonable.  So the question is not whether  anybody\r\n\r\nhad  instigated any of the settlers. The  question  is\r\n\r\nthe equity of compensation. For instance, if you force\r\n\r\nhawkers to some site very far away, it will amount  to\r\n\r\nunemployment  to  these hawkers who cannot  ply  their\r\n\r\ntrade  in  the  areas  they are to  settle.  Have  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   considered  this   problem?   Have   they\r\n\r\nconsidered  all  this?  For  instance,  if  bean-curd\r\n\r\nmakers  are resettled in areas which are not  suitable\r\n\r\nfor their trade, their livelihood will be affected. So\r\n\r\nI  hope the Government can pay more attention and give\r\n\r\nmore  consideration to this aspect. I hope  they  will\r\n\r\nannounce  their plans and their compensation  rate  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  in  order to enable the  people  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  compensation rate and other  things  are\r\n\r\nreasonable.  Because in the past many people  had  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that the Government had deceived  them  by\r\n\r\nbeing  told  that they could go to certain  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments to get their compensation, but  when  they\r\n\r\nreturned they found their houses had been pulled  down\r\n\r\nby  demolition  squads  and riot  squads.  So  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can enlighten these people as to  the  rate\r\n\r\nof compensation, they will be satisfied.

The  Government are  not  adopting  a\r\n\r\npolicy of an enlightened and democratic government but\r\n\r\na policy which is not befitting a good government. For\r\n\r\ninstance,  Government officers went round to  ask  the\r\n\r\nsettlers concerned to move out to some other areas  or\r\n\r\nelse  they  would  be  moved  out  by  force.  As   an\r\n\r\ninducement, they said that the Government  would  give\r\n\r\neach  of  them a certain sum of money to help them  to\r\n\r\nmove  out,  but  in  the  end  nothing  happened.  The\r\n\r\npromises  were not kept by them. This is not  the  way\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should carry out  their  resettlement\r\n\r\npolicy. The settlers did not mean to just stay on  the\r\n\r\nland.  There is the question of compensation  for  the\r\n\r\nloss  of their livelihood. If the Government want them\r\n\r\nto  remove  from certain areas, they should take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the loss of their livelihood.  On  this\r\n\r\nquestion,  the Government have been playing  politics.\r\n\r\nIf  they had been defeated in the last election,  then\r\n\r\nduring the last stages of their rule, they would  have\r\n\r\nbehaved worse than at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When some farmers refused to remove, the Government\r\n\r\nused riot squad vans, police, demolition personnel and\r\n\r\nbulldozers  to  forcibly  evict  them.  Why  did   the\r\n\r\nGovernment take such inhuman action against the people\r\n\r\nconcerned? Why did they adopt such forceful and brutal\r\n\r\nmeans to bulldoze through the houses and the vegetable\r\n\r\nplots of the farmers concerned? This goes to show that\r\n\r\nthe  Government have not been quite proper in the  way\r\n\r\nthey   dealt   with  the  farmers.   The   Toa   Payoh\r\n\r\nresettlement scheme involves the livelihood  of  about\r\n\r\n20,000  people. The Government should  also  think  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  their  economic well-being and  livelihood.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the limited vegetable plots  and  limited\r\n\r\narea  for  growing agricultural produce in Toa  Payoh,\r\n\r\nthe farmers can fetch higher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprices for their produce, but by asking them to remove\r\n\r\nto  some  other  outlying areas,  the  Government  are\r\n\r\ncausing  them to suffer a loss. The Government  should\r\n\r\nalso  see  that  the areas allocated to the  resettled\r\n\r\nfarmers are suitable for agricultural purposes.  Also,\r\n\r\nwhen  these  people are resettled in  outlying  areas,\r\n\r\nthey wilt have to spend more money on transportation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government have been telling the public that\r\n\r\nthey  intend to help the farmers increase  their  farm\r\n\r\nproduce and lower their costs of production. They also\r\n\r\nsay  that they will develop the rural areas. I do  not\r\n\r\nsay  that this is not good, but they should, first  of\r\n\r\nall,  pay  more  attention to the  livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers and the people concerned and not make  this  a\r\n\r\npolitical propaganda issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the Government-benchers gone round to see these\r\n\r\nareas  for  themselves? If they have a  conscience,  I\r\n\r\nthink they will shed tears when they see the miserable\r\n\r\nliving  conditions  of those settlers  who  have  been\r\n\r\nasked  to  move out, because members of the demolition\r\n\r\nsquad have even used parangs and other tools in a cold-blooded  way.  The  Government have  not  paid  enough\r\n\r\nattention to the difficulties and economic problems of\r\n\r\nthe farmers and the rate of compensation. On the other\r\n\r\nhand, they have forced the removal of farmers and they\r\n\r\nbrand  those who do not want to be evicted as trouble-makers.  If they resort to force and brutality without\r\n\r\nany  consideration for human rights and other  things,\r\n\r\nthen  these people who are forced to leave their farms\r\n\r\nand  homesteads  will naturally show their  anger  and\r\n\r\nhatred.  So  I  hope in respect of their  resettlement\r\n\r\nscheme  the Government will announce in advance  their\r\n\r\nplans  as to the parts of Singapore that will be  used\r\n\r\nas  resettlement  areas and the  sites  that  will  be\r\n\r\nacquired.  They  should  also  publish  the  rate   of\r\n\r\ncompensation and other relevant details  in  order  to\r\n\r\nhelp the people concerned to enable them to understand\r\n\r\nand  comply with the Government's plans, so that  they\r\n\r\nwill be resettled --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member is repeating himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

When I first made my answer,\r\n\r\nI  tried to clarify briefly. It appears to me that the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Choa  Chu Kang who  has  asked  that  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  resettlement  should  not  be  used   as\r\n\r\npolitical  propaganda, has himself  embarked  on  that\r\n\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the allegations are that we forcibly evicted these people and broke up their homes. I had no opportunity to speak the other day on a similar matter. He alleges that the police and bulldozers wrecked the houses and that the Malays came out with their parangs. This is a communal matter. He\r\n\r\nbrought in the Malays as well, alleging that they came\r\n\r\nout  with  their parangs. It is very irresponsible  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member to say this. If anything untoward were  to\r\n\r\ntake  place  as  a  result of what he  has  said,  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  it should rest  squarely  on  his\r\n\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of resettlement of those persons who are staying in Toa Payoh and who are involved in this scheme I have to say this. If it had not been for the activities of the Country People's Association who are pro-Barisan and pro-Communists, the resettlement scheme could have been carried out\r\n\r\npeacefully. But because of the whispering campaign and\r\n\r\nrumours\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspread  by  members of the Barisan  Sosialis  and  the\r\n\r\nCountry  People's Association among those persons  who\r\n\r\nare  involved in the resettlement scheme, these people\r\n\r\nremain adamant. Also, because they are forced by these\r\n\r\nirresponsible   people  they   have   to   stay   put.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask him to withdraw\r\n\r\nthe word \"lie\" which he has used just now - \"bohong\" in\r\n\r\nMalay.  I  demand  that  he withdraw  that  word,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I say that it is unparliamentary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been stated in this House that the Ministry of National Development will reconsider the question of payment of compensation to the people involved in resettlement, but if the matter is repeated over and over again, it merely shows that the Members opposite want to exploit this situation\r\n\r\nfor political purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in charge of matters pertaining to land including resettlement. We do not go and destroy illegal houses while the occupants are away. In fact, we give them two years' notice, and the hon. Member opposite knows it well. It is only after this period that we go about demolishing illegal\r\n\r\nhouses - and that also after having given them a number\r\n\r\nof notices to vacate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this unfair? Is this what you say that we are\r\n\r\nusing  forceful methods? If it is alleged  that  these\r\n\r\nhouses were demolished white the occupants were  away,\r\n\r\nthis is completely untrue. Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as\r\n\r\nI  know,  with  regard  to most  of  the  resettlement\r\n\r\nschemes  carried  out because of Government  projects,\r\n\r\nthe  Government usually offer alternative sites  after\r\n\r\nserious  consideration. In fact,  facilities  too  are\r\n\r\nprovided,  such as water supply, roads,  etc.  Do  you\r\n\r\nknow  that  the resettlement of a family  involves  an\r\n\r\nexpenditure of about $8,000? The expenditure  incurred\r\n\r\nby Government to purchase land amounts to about $4,000\r\n\r\nto  $5,000. And then to lay on water supply, to lay on\r\n\r\nroads, etc. Do the members of the Barisan Sosialis not\r\n\r\nsee  all  this? If only they will see and be  true  to\r\n\r\nthemselves, then they will appreciate this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the policy of this Government is against the\r\n\r\ninterest of the people, I believe the Government would\r\n\r\nnever  be  able to win the elections by  obtaining  37\r\n\r\nseats.  The  people have been cheated  twice  already.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot be cheated a third time. The words  which\r\n\r\nhave  been uttered by the hon.

The theme is\r\n\r\nthe  same and the person bringing up the matter is the\r\n\r\nsame.  Only  the date is different. Is  there  nothing\r\n\r\nmore  profitable for us to discuss here than to repeat\r\n\r\nthe  same thing over and over again? Even if they say\r\n\r\nthese  are constructive arguments, they have  ulterior\r\n\r\nmotives. In an indirect way, what they say will defeat\r\n\r\nthe good that the Government are trying to bring about\r\n\r\nfor the people. Mr Speaker, Sir, therefore, I say  it\r\n\r\nis  only those whose vision is blurred who cannot  see\r\n\r\nclearly. It is only those who have defective ears  who\r\n\r\ncannot  hear  the  good  that is  being  done  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

Now, I am not in charge of the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities  Board. He  knows  that  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board provides the State with water,  light\r\n\r\nand  gas. Now, in what respect is he dissatisfied with\r\n\r\nthe performance of the Public Utilities Board, and  in\r\n\r\nwhat way? What further details does he want? If he is\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with a particular aspect of  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board, perhaps he would like to say  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat is troubling him.

Let me now give you certain facts. In the first\r\n\r\nplace, I wish to bring your attention to the supply of\r\n\r\nelectricity.  We can see that in the Katong  area  and\r\n\r\nTanglin area, where rich people live, there are street\r\n\r\nlights in the roads and the small lanes, and there  is\r\n\r\nan  adequate  supply of electricity available  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents  there. But, on the other  hand,  in  places\r\n\r\nsuch  as my own constituency and Changi 7 m.s.,  there\r\n\r\nis  one  area  still solely occupied by Europeans  and\r\n\r\nthis  place  is  adequately supplied with  electricity\r\n\r\nbecause it is a place for the rich people. But in slum\r\n\r\nareas  the situation is entirely different and  cannot\r\n\r\ncompare  favourably  to areas  occupied  by  the  rich\r\n\r\npeople.  Although  we do not deny  the  fact  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  supply  electricity to  the  rich,  we  cannot\r\n\r\ndeprive  similar facilities to the poor. In  the  area\r\n\r\nthat  I  have in mind, there is not an adequate supply\r\n\r\nof electricity and installation of street lights. This\r\n\r\nis a contrast to those places occupied by European and\r\n\r\nrich people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give you another example. At 6\u00be up to 8\u00be m.s.\r\n\r\nTampines  Road,  there  is  an  inadequate  supply  of\r\n\r\nelectricity in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, we are discussing the Development Estimates and I\r\n\r\nthink this is no time to go into details of particular\r\n\r\nareas  where there is not enough lighting. The  Member\r\n\r\nhas made his point there is not enough lighting. If he\r\n\r\nthinks that the rich get preference over the poor, all\r\n\r\nright. Having established that, let us go to the  next\r\n\r\npoint. This is not the City Council --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I think you have made\r\n\r\nyour  point,  that in some places there is electricity\r\n\r\nand  in others there is none. There is no need  to  go\r\n\r\ninto some more examples. Can you proceed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, I am\r\n\r\ngiving  you all these details in order to satisfy  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance who has  asked  me  to  provide\r\n\r\ndetails  to  show my dissatisfaction. There  are  many\r\n\r\nother places with which I am not satisfied, but I just\r\n\r\ngive you enough examples to show my dissatisfaction.

If you have anything to\r\n\r\nsay  on this particular subject, I will listen to you.\r\n\r\nBut  if  you are merely commenting on Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition, I am not prepared to allow you to go on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. The\r\n\r\nMember says that in the poor areas - the squatter areas\r\n\r\n- there is no street lighting. Before we can put up any\r\n\r\nstreet lighting under the Local Government Integration\r\n\r\nOrdinance, I think, it is stated that the streets must\r\n\r\nbe  made up to certain specifications. Now, the  areas\r\n\r\nhe has mentioned where there is street lighting, these\r\n\r\nstreets   are   made  up  to  certain  specifications,\r\n\r\nspecifications acceptable to the City Council, to  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities  Board,  and  therefore  the  street\r\n\r\nlights are installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is another point. The reason why we do not\r\n\r\nallow  unauthorised houses to be put up is  that  they\r\n\r\nare put up in a disorderly manner and it is impossible\r\n\r\nfor us to lay streets which are worthy of our city and\r\n\r\nwhich   are,   shall  I  say,  acceptable   means   of\r\n\r\ncommunication. It is not a question of whether that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narea  is  poor or whether that area is rich. It  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion of which area is well planned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chairman, I have\r\n\r\nnever  talked about houses or unauthorised structures.\r\n\r\nI  am  just complaining that in the areas occupied  by\r\n\r\nthe  rich  men, even in small lanes there  are  street\r\n\r\nlights; whereas in places occupied by the poor people,\r\n\r\nwhose  occupants  far outnumber the  rich  in  certain\r\n\r\nareas, there is no provision of street lamps. That  is\r\n\r\nmy  dissatisfaction which I am raising to show to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance at his request. But  all  of  a\r\n\r\nsudden  you  have an Acting Minister for  Finance  who\r\n\r\ntalks about houses and unauthorised buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> About street lights the Member\r\n\r\nmust  remember that the building of street lights  has\r\n\r\nbeen  going on for perhaps 150 years, and not all  the\r\n\r\nstreet  lights in Singapore today were  built  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  4\u00bd  years under the P.A.P. Government. True,  in\r\n\r\nthe past there was preference for Europeans, we do not\r\n\r\ndeny  that  - during colonial times - and I  agree  this\r\n\r\nhappened. So, what does the Member want us to do? Pull\r\n\r\ndown the streetlights in Tanglin? Surely not. No,  the\r\n\r\nway to do it is to make sure that electricity goes  to\r\n\r\nplaces  which were neglected in the past. At  present,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  have worked out an  emergency  scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby electricity can be conveyed to villages  which\r\n\r\nformerly had no hope of getting electricity.  The  way\r\n\r\nof  doing it is not to maintain the high standards  of\r\n\r\nelectric mains in the rural areas, where they have  to\r\n\r\ndig  ditches and have underground cables, but to  have\r\n\r\nelectric cables on poles. An extensive system has been\r\n\r\nworked  out  and planned, and the scheme will  be  put\r\n\r\ninto  operation. For all I know, it might have already\r\n\r\nstarted in certain areas, but certainly the money  for\r\n\r\nthe  extension of electricity supply to  villages  has\r\n\r\nbeen  approved.  And, of course, this thing  has  been\r\n\r\ngoing  on for the last 4 years. But surely the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tampines does not expect very much to be done in 4\r\n\r\nyears - one and a half centuries of colonial neglect to\r\n\r\nbe set right by the P.A.P. in 4 years. I mean, that is\r\n\r\nbeing completely unreasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, perhaps for the record, I should say just what\r\n\r\nthis  $12.5  million  is for.  This  year  the  Public\r\n\r\nUtilities Board, that is the Gas Department, the Water\r\n\r\nDepartment  and the Electricity Department engages  in\r\n\r\ncapital  construction projects to a  very  substantial\r\n\r\namount, something like $50 to $60 million a year,  and\r\n\r\nthat is excluding major capital undertakings like  the\r\n\r\nPasir Panjang Power Station or the Johore River Scheme\r\n\r\nor the Scudai River Scheme. These development projects\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  extension of water  mains,  electricity\r\n\r\nmains, gas lights, the installation of substations and\r\n\r\nso  on and so forth. For a lot of the capital for such\r\n\r\nextension works, the departments themselves were  able\r\n\r\nto  meet from their current revenue surpluses. It  was\r\n\r\nbecause of the major undertakings that the P.U.B. are\r\n\r\nnow  having  in  hand - that is, the power  station  in\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang,  which will eventually cost  something\r\n\r\nlike  $70 to $80 million, the Johore River Scheme  and\r\n\r\nthe  Scudai Scheme - that they find that they will  not\r\n\r\nbe able to meet the demands of both the major projects\r\n\r\nas  well  as their normal expansion projects. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  they  have to come to the Government  for  loans.\r\n\r\nThese  loans  are on fairly reasonable  terms  for  20\r\n\r\nyears  at  5\u00be per cent simple interest, and they  will\r\n\r\nhelp  the P.U.B. to bring about just the services that\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tampines wants, that is, electricity to\r\n\r\nthe villages, water mains wherever it is possible. But\r\n\r\nwe have to remember this, that it is also not possible\r\n\r\nto provide electricity or water to each and every home\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Supposing a group of 3 families at  the\r\n\r\nend  far away from the main lines, I mean just to  run\r\n\r\nthe  lines  there will cost such a substantial  amount\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  be subsidising these 3 families.  But\r\n\r\nwhere  there are compact settlements of 100 homes,  50\r\n\r\nhomes, it will not be long before most of these  rural\r\n\r\nareas  will be provided with electricity.  I  hope  my\r\n\r\nexplanation satisfies the Member for Tampines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nview  of  the  explanation and  because  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself has admitted that rural areas have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneglected  in the past and he has undertaken  to  look\r\n\r\ninto the matter, I withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $12,500,000 for Head D32 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Second Supplementary Development Estimates\r\n\r\nof Expenditure for 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head D37-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D37 be reduced\r\n\r\nby the whole sum in respect of subhead 9.

The purpose of such\r\n\r\na   Bill  is  to  provide  for  the  issue  from   the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund of the sums necessary to  meet  that\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and the appropriation of those  sums  for\r\n\r\nthe purposes specified therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supply Bill before Members is to give\r\n\r\nlegislative  authority to direct special approval  for\r\n\r\nthe  issue of funds from the Consolidated Fund to meet\r\n\r\nthe  sums  of  expenditure shown in the  Estimates  of\r\n\r\nExpenditure  for  1964.  Once  the  Supply   Bill   is\r\n\r\napproved,  I  will  be  empowered  to  issue  warrants\r\n\r\nauthorising  expenditure up to the amount  under  each\r\n\r\nHead  as  shown in the Bill to be paid  out  from  the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Third Reading</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Those who have as yet not spoken will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  a chance to speak. When last we adjourned  this\r\n\r\ndebate, the Member for Jalan Kayu had the Floor.  Will\r\n\r\nhe  indicate whether he wishes to carry on or  whether\r\n\r\nhe had finished his speech then?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, for the past one week the debate in this\r\n\r\nHouse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  revealed several matters and facts. I  will  talk\r\n\r\nabout these facts. The first fact is to show that  the\r\n\r\nreactionaries in Singapore and Malaya have been led by\r\n\r\nthe  nose by the British, who imposed Malaysia on  the\r\n\r\npeople  here, resulting in difficulties and hardships.\r\n\r\nAll these can be seen from the evasive attitude of the\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second fact is that the P.A.P. resort to dirty\r\n\r\ntactics. They are opportunists and they dare not  face\r\n\r\nrealities  brought about by Malaysia. They are  making\r\n\r\nuse  of propaganda and other tactics to put the  blame\r\n\r\non the Barisan Sosialis. This is a very low tactic and\r\n\r\nis despicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third fact is that the Prime Minister is\r\n\r\ndreaming  of  the P.A.P. being able to  supersede  the\r\n\r\nM.C.A. in the Federation. This can be seen  from  his\r\n\r\nspeeches when he came back from London. When  he  came\r\n\r\nback  from London, he said that it was only the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwho  could  fight the Communists. It is very  low  and\r\n\r\nmean  of  them to appease the British and curry  their\r\n\r\nfavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that this House is full of foul\r\n\r\nwords.  Every  now and then they talk about  Communist\r\n\r\nbogeys.  Even their Back-benchers indulge in such  low\r\n\r\ntactics.   The  P.A.P. dare  not  face  the   Central\r\n\r\nParliament. Therefore, they have to resort to the  use\r\n\r\nof  the Communist bogey. We hope the Ministers and the\r\n\r\nParty  in power will be calm in their attitude and  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss with us how to urge the Central Government  to\r\n\r\nresolve   the   differences  between   Indonesia   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  They  should not play  party  politics  and\r\n\r\nbring  hardship on the people of Singapore. These  are\r\n\r\nthe  characteristics of the debate  in  the  past  few\r\n\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about what the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nsaid.  In  moving his motion, the Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid that when the Yang di-Pertuan Negara came to this\r\n\r\nHouse  to deliver his speech there was no gun  salute.\r\n\r\nThat  means  that the power has been  shifted  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation. It is not the shifting of the  power,  but\r\n\r\nthe sell-out of our power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore are very concerned about\r\n\r\nthis  power. They are not concerned about the question\r\n\r\nwhether there should be a gun salute when the Yang di-Pertuan Negara comes to this House. What the people in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  concerned about is  their  citizenship\r\n\r\nproblem;  whether there is equality on  the  issue  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  whether  there  is  equality  in   their\r\n\r\npolitical  rights, whether their present problems  and\r\n\r\ntheir  livelihood can be solved or not. These are  the\r\n\r\nquestions which our people are concerned about. But we\r\n\r\nfind  that  the Government Ministers and  their  Back-benchers dare not face stark realities. Their speeches\r\n\r\ntend  to evade the fundamental problems affecting  the\r\n\r\npeople's  livelihood. Instead, they use all  sorts  of\r\n\r\nepithets to cover up their sell-out of the interest of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore. And they try  to  describe\r\n\r\nSingapore as a paradise in South-East Asia. I want  to\r\n\r\nreiterate what I have said in the past. That is,  what\r\n\r\nwe  have said and done is right. They are motivated by\r\n\r\nour  desire to look after the interests of the people.\r\n\r\nWe  have  said  that  Malaysia was  brought  about  by\r\n\r\ncolonialism  and imperialism to replace the  so-called\r\n\r\ndivide-and-rule  policy of the past  colonial  regime.\r\n\r\nThis  divide-and-rule  policy can  be  seen  in  other\r\n\r\nterritories as well. We are able to see that Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been  going backwards, retrogressing, politically\r\n\r\nand  constitutionally. Mr Speaker, in  the  past  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore made great sacrifices to secure  a\r\n\r\nsemi  self-governing  status  for  Singapore.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  be  united  with  the  people   and\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  this  kind of  struggle  in  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve  full internal self-government, then it  would\r\n\r\nbe very good But, regrettably, after the establishment\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia,  the  ruling  clique  in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\ncollaborated   with   the   Central   Government    in\r\n\r\nsurrendering  all  the  rights and  interests  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government, thereby resulting in the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore   losing  equality  in  the   economic   and\r\n\r\npolitical  fields and other rights. In  the  past  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister told us that we would get equality  and\r\n\r\na  fair chance in respect of citizenship rights. Since\r\n\r\nthe citizens from the Federation of Malaya could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncome to Singapore, we should also be allowed to go  to\r\n\r\nMalaya  to  take  part  in all  sorts  of  activities.\r\n\r\nOtherwise it would be a kind of sell-out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the present situation, Singapore's\r\n\r\nposition is one that is being ruled. We are losing our\r\n\r\nnatural rights, and in the end Singapore will become a\r\n\r\ncolony  of  the Federation. At present  we  have  only\r\n\r\nobligations and duties. We have no rights  in  return.\r\n\r\nWe  have  the obligation to pay taxes but we  have  no\r\n\r\nright  to  receive  anything out of these  taxes.  The\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  Government  Back-benchers  have  never\r\n\r\ndared to mention this question. According to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  we  have stepped into a new  phase  in  our\r\n\r\nhistory in achieving independence through merger  with\r\n\r\nMalaya.  This kind of phrase has been used to  deceive\r\n\r\nthe  people.  It  is used as a kind of  propaganda  to\r\n\r\ndeceive the people. Malaysia has been brought about by\r\n\r\nthe  British  in collaboration with the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  It was also abetted by the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  has  been  brought about through  the  joint\r\n\r\nefforts  of the three Parties. They even went  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of resorting to force to bring about Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThey  arrested anti-Malaysian nationals  in  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve their purpose. Now that these people in  Sabah\r\n\r\nand Sarawak have been arrested, they have now come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  to arrest these people. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nshould  admit these facts. They talk about the  United\r\n\r\nNations   Investigation  Commission  to   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories to inquire into the wishes of  the  people\r\n\r\nin  regard to the establishment of Malaysia. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthey were only sent there after the Malaysia plan  had\r\n\r\nbeen  conceived and even carried out.  If  the  result\r\n\r\nshowed  that  the people did not agree to  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia, then what would be their next step? We  know\r\n\r\ntheir  tactics.  Ngo  Dinh Diem could  remain  as  the\r\n\r\nPresident even though the majority of the people hated\r\n\r\nhim.  So this does not show that if you have a certain\r\n\r\namount  of  votes you have the support of the  people,\r\n\r\nbecause  the Government has control over the  election\r\n\r\nmachinery. It does not show that if you are  in  power\r\n\r\nyou  have the support of the people. It does not  also\r\n\r\nmean that the results of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  U.N. Investigation Commission have reflected the\r\n\r\ntrue wishes of the people there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the series of incidents consequent upon\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of Malaysia go to explain  why  the\r\n\r\nBritish  and the P.A.P. wanted to bring about Malaysia\r\n\r\nas quickly as possible. Their motive was clear to all.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for them to do so. I will  just\r\n\r\nmention  a  few evil things that they have done.  Many\r\n\r\nmembers  of  our  Party have been arrested.  Even  our\r\n\r\nAssemblymen have been arrested. These are some of  the\r\n\r\nevils  that they have done in collaboration  with  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists and reactionaries. Some are forced to  go\r\n\r\ninto  hiding.  I  believe that if Government  were  to\r\n\r\nbring  them to open court for a trial, they would  not\r\n\r\nrun away. They have smeared us as rioters in the past.\r\n\r\nYet  we  did not run away. These people who  have  now\r\n\r\nbeen  arrested are innocent. If you were to set  up  a\r\n\r\ncourt  and  bring them to open trial, would  they  run\r\n\r\naway?  I  believe they would not run away. They  would\r\n\r\ncome out courageously to face the trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain civic organisations have been banned by the\r\n\r\nGovernment on the pretext that they are pro-Communist.\r\n\r\nThis  is  also another deception. The real  reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  these  bodies  are actually  looking  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  people. They  are  in  very  close\r\n\r\ncontact with them. Their relationship with the  people\r\n\r\nis  very  good since they are furthering the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  people. Since you are anti-people and jealous\r\n\r\nof  their good relationship with the people, you  have\r\n\r\nno other alternative but to ban these organisations in\r\n\r\norder  that  you  might  gain  something  out  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation.

He\r\n\r\nwill die a natural death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following these arrests, the P.A.P.

All\r\n\r\nthese have been brought about by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the\r\n\r\nfancies  of  our Singapore Prime Minister  who  dreams \r\n\r\nabout  becoming  the Prime Minister of Malaysia.  From \r\n\r\nhis  speeches recently we could see that he  had  been \r\n\r\nindulging in souring up the good relationship  between \r\n\r\nthe  M.C.A. (Malaya) and U.M.N.O. in order to  achieve\r\n\r\nhis   purpose  of  becoming  the  Prime  Minister   of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  We  and  even the Tunku himself  could  see\r\n\r\nthrough his intrigues. The Tunku is not a fool. We can\r\n\r\nmake  an  assessment of the political development  and\r\n\r\nthe  situation in Singapore and Malaya. His hopes  can\r\n\r\nnever   materialise,  because,  first  of   all,   the\r\n\r\ninterests of M.C.A. (Malaya) and U.M.N.O. leaders  are\r\n\r\nclosely related. The Prime Minister cannot achieve his\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that some of these P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen have come from U.M.N.O. Before the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwas  a political power, the U.M.N.O. and the Singapore\r\n\r\nPeople's Alliance had had an agreement between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of\r\n\r\norder.

If  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have  a  brother party in  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  like  the Socialist Front, then perhaps  there\r\n\r\ncan  be a political future for them in the Federation.\r\n\r\nBut  since  the  Socialist  Front  and  those  in  the\r\n\r\nsocialist camp have kicked them out and have condemned\r\n\r\nthem  as  stooges of neo-colonialists, they  therefore\r\n\r\ncannot achieve their ultimate aim of seizing power  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. The most important thing is that  the\r\n\r\nBritish  have now found that the Tunku is more capable\r\n\r\nof looking after British interests in this part of the\r\n\r\nworld  than  the P.A.P., otherwise they might  have  a\r\n\r\nchance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me now touch on some of the\r\n\r\nutterances  made  by  the  Minister  for  Labour.  \r\n\r\nThe Minister  for  Labour has been rather  unique  in \r\n\r\nhis speeches in the last few days --- \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are not debating the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour or what the Minister has said for the last\r\n\r\nthree  days.

Can\r\n\r\nthe  Member  leave the Minister for Labour  alone  and\r\n\r\nwhat  he has said in this Assembly? Otherwise we  will\r\n\r\ngo on to that.

So I am just  going\r\n\r\nto  deal with several points in his speech to show his\r\n\r\nhooliganism. The Minister for Labour appears to  be  a\r\n\r\ngood  candidate for Assistant Anti-Communist  Minister\r\n\r\nof  the Ministry of Culture. His speeches are full  of\r\n\r\ngrandmother's talk. And in this respect he is  similar\r\n\r\nto the Minister for Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I greatly suspect that because the Minister for Labour has been successful in this respect, he has been able to become a Minister. This is very welcome to and appreciated by the British, because the present Minister for Labour has learnt well from the Minister for Culture in calling others\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> On a point of order.

Here  you\r\n\r\nhave a full coverage of the speech by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour on this page and on the other\r\n\r\npage  [Indicating]. So I am going to quote, if I  want\r\n\r\nto  quote from the newspapers, it will take a  lot  of\r\n\r\ntime,  but I do not desire to do so, i have  to  point\r\n\r\nout   here,  Mr  Speaker,  that  \"Communist\"  is   an\r\n\r\nexpression which has been used by the reactionary  and\r\n\r\ncolonial  elements against patriots of  countries  all\r\n\r\nover   the  world.  For  example,  the  British,   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  the  P.A.P.,  in  order  to  take  action\r\n\r\nagainst  the  national patriots in this  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,   have  resorted  to  the  adoption   of   this\r\n\r\nexpression.  Without  using  this  tactic,  they  just\r\n\r\ncannot  do  anything against the Barisan Sosialis.  If\r\n\r\nthey  want to have an open trial against us,  then  we\r\n\r\nwill  be acquitted and discharged. Those found  guilty\r\n\r\nwill be the P.A.P. - guilty of treason and treachery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you some more facts, Mr Speaker. I was\r\n\r\ntalking  about Ngo Dinh Diem, who called the nuns  and\r\n\r\nthe monks in South Vietnam Communists. Before Lee Kuan\r\n\r\nYew  became the Prime Minister, he was also  called  a\r\n\r\nCommunist.  You can refer to the back  copies  of  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  So let me tell you the use of \"Communist\"\r\n\r\nagainst  political opponents is the best  method  ever\r\n\r\navailable.  As  I  have said last week,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nCommunists  existed in the past. As  far  as  I  know,\r\n\r\nthere are no Communists now. The Communists came  into\r\n\r\nexistence  against  the Fascists of  the  Japanese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaya. They took up arms  against  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  and  later  on against the  British  in  the\r\n\r\nnational  interest. Now there are no more  Communists.\r\n\r\nBut  the Barisan Sosialis, which is a legitimate Party\r\n\r\nregistered according to the law, has also been branded\r\n\r\nCommunist.  It is a pity that they have to  resort  to\r\n\r\nthis   means  of  calling  their  political  opponents\r\n\r\nCommunists. This only goes to show their inability and\r\n\r\nincompetency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Labour said last week that Singapore was a paradise on earth. His talk was full of exaggeration. He described life in Singapore as happy and gay. I give\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou one illustration. When he has gained the favour of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister, of course, his life is happy  and\r\n\r\ngay.  Why? Because he gets a salary of $2,500 a  month\r\n\r\nas  a  Minister  and  he  gets another  $500  a  month\r\n\r\nallowance and he has a car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> On a point of order. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour is getting $2,500 a month salary. What  has\r\n\r\nthat  got  to  do  with  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Jalan Kayu seems\r\n\r\npersistently to want to attack the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nin  spite of my ruling. Please forget the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour. Let us get on with the debate. Otherwise there\r\n\r\nwill  be further attacks from this side and we  go  on\r\n\r\nand on forever. Mr Tan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am just basing my talk on the facts related to  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. His speech is full of\r\n\r\nsmears against the Barisan Sosialis. Now, if we cannot\r\n\r\nexplain  away  their  points,  that  will  amount   to\r\n\r\nadmitting  that the Barisan Sosialis is to  be  blamed\r\n\r\nfor  the confrontation. So, in order to show that they\r\n\r\nare  trying to indulge in humbug propaganda to deceive\r\n\r\nthe  people,  I wish that you will give me  sufficient\r\n\r\ntime, Mr Speaker, to explain the position clearly  in\r\n\r\norder  that the people of Singapore will not be misled\r\n\r\nby the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister said in his speech, Singapore is a\r\n\r\nparadise  on earth comparable to New York in  America,\r\n\r\nand  he  says  that  Singapore  is  the  New  York  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  If  you can say, according to  facts,  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is the New York of Malaysia, then we will be\r\n\r\nvery  happy.  Then they try to compare Singapore  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and  say that Indonesia is a hundred  times\r\n\r\nworse  off  than Singapore, but this is  entirely  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of Indonesia. Of course, we wish to  have  a\r\n\r\nhappier life. We have a chair, we want to have a sofa,\r\n\r\nthat  is  a natural desire. The people want to improve\r\n\r\ntheir  livelihood from time to time. That goes without\r\n\r\nsaying. So I am just trying to say that if you want\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  get the salary of the Minister as the basis to say\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore is a paradise, of course, it is  true,\r\n\r\nbut true only to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other question I wish to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour. Why has he seen fit to evade  the\r\n\r\nmention of workers who have to work under the hot  and\r\n\r\nburning sun year in and year out? Why has he failed to\r\n\r\nmention the fact that these labourers and workers  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  earn enough to keep their  body  and  soul\r\n\r\ntogether, that they are unable to have a decent  life?\r\n\r\nNow, why has he failed to mention all these facts?  He\r\n\r\nshould  have mentioned taxi-drivers and trishaw riders\r\n\r\nas the basis in saying whether Singapore is a paradise\r\n\r\non  earth  or  not. There is mounting unemployment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Students who have passed out  from  school\r\n\r\nwill go and join the ranks of unemployed labour. There\r\n\r\nare  many graduates from the secondary schools who are\r\n\r\nstill  unemployed after years of graduation. Are these\r\n\r\nnot facts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I hope that those people, particularly the Minister for Labour, who say that Singapore is a paradise on earth will go round Singapore Island and see the large number of beggars and shoe-shine boys in the city of Singapore. They have only to sit down in Chinatown and then their legs will be pulled by these\r\n\r\nshoe-shine  boys. Now, why should they  do  this,  why\r\n\r\nshould  they behave in this manner? They do so because\r\n\r\nthey  are  forced by circumstances, because  of  their\r\n\r\nmiserable  life. Are these not facts? If the Ministers\r\n\r\ndo  not  believe in what I say, they  can  go  to  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Park for some time; then they will agree with\r\n\r\nme. If they appreciate these facts, then they will not\r\n\r\ndare  to indulge in the nonsense that Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nparadise on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they also stand up, on the other hand, and say\r\n\r\nthat Singapore has not sold out Chinese education. Our\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have already mentioned certain  points  in\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  but I wish to add to their  views.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour drew an analogy by saying that the\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries were trying to destroy  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation and that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere quite successful. But it is a pity that he should\r\n\r\nhave  drawn an analogy on this basis. If he is  right,\r\n\r\nthen there is no point for the people to struggle  for\r\n\r\na better life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to tell you now that the situation\r\n\r\nregarding  education is not as he said. He  said  that\r\n\r\nthe  teachers are getting good salaries, the  students\r\n\r\nare  well dressed and well fed. But there is one point\r\n\r\nwhich  he  forgot, that is, the security of employment\r\n\r\nof some teachers. If they do not get the favour of the\r\n\r\nParty  or  the  principal, then  their  jobs  will  be\r\n\r\ninsecure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another point. There are many parents\r\n\r\nwho  wish  to send their children to aided schools  in\r\n\r\nChinese,  but the vacancies are all taken up.  So  the\r\n\r\nonly  thing  that  they can do is  to  go  to  English\r\n\r\nschools. Is this not the way by which they take action\r\n\r\nto destroy Chinese education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They talk about the outlet of the Chinese school\r\n\r\nstudents.  They are not fairly treated in  so  far  as\r\n\r\nemployment is concerned. The Senior III graduates even\r\n\r\nfind  it  difficult  to get jobs as  teachers  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese schools. This also shows that this is the best\r\n\r\nway to force children not to go to Chinese schools, to\r\n\r\nnarrow  down their outlet in order to divert  children\r\n\r\nto English schools in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to mention that the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nis  full  of the colonialistic outlook in his  speech.\r\n\r\nThere is one paragraph here in which he says that  the\r\n\r\namendment moved by the Barisan Sosialis, to  urge  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to get the Central Government to negotiate with\r\n\r\nIndonesia, is a means by which we wish to have foreign\r\n\r\ninterference in our local affairs. He goes on  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  if  we  should  abolish  all  British  bases  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  tomorrow, then we will become an Indonesian\r\n\r\ncolony. This is what he has said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, it appears\r\n\r\nthat  the Barisan Sosialis are not debating the speech\r\n\r\nof  His Excellency but the speech by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour.  It  appears to me that he is being irrelevant\r\n\r\nto the speech by His Excellency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W.

Please proceed, Mr Tan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nperhaps  the Back-benchers of the Government have  not\r\n\r\nheard  what the Ministers have said and they have  not\r\n\r\neven read the newspapers about what they have said. If\r\n\r\nthey had, they would know that the Ministers' speeches\r\n\r\ndealt with the amendment. But I will forget about them\r\n\r\nnow and go back to the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I wish to say that the speech made by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour was purely in defence of the  rule\r\n\r\nof  the  British  colonialists,  because  the  British\r\n\r\ncolonialists have no locus standi in this Chamber, and\r\n\r\nso  the  Minister for Labour has come up to  speak  in\r\n\r\ndefence  of  the British colonialists. He becomes  the\r\n\r\nmouthpiece of the British colonial masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past they were very fond of using such\r\n\r\nexpressions as \"anti-national elements\" and  the  rest\r\n\r\nof  it.  I  think  it  is more appropriate  that  such\r\n\r\nphrases  should be used on the P.A.P. Members.  It  is\r\n\r\nthey  who  are  anti-national, they who are  loyal  to\r\n\r\nforeign forces and powers, it is not we in the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis who are so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few points to draw your attention to, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  For  example, the Minister for  Labour  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  people of Singapore will have no chance  of\r\n\r\ngetting  independence  if we  should  drive  away  the\r\n\r\nBritish  because Indonesia is a big power.  So  if  we\r\n\r\nshould  drive  the British away, the Indonesians  will\r\n\r\ncome  in  and  then we will have no chance  to  become\r\n\r\nindependent. In other words, you must either be  ruled\r\n\r\nby  the  British or by the Indonesians. That is  their\r\n\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say Malaysia will bring prosperity. Now this is\r\n\r\nagain  another  humbug. I will put it  the  other  way\r\n\r\nround. Malaysia brings neo-colonialism in this part of\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour said also that the British have got bases in Singapore for well over a hundred years. True, nobody can ever deny it. I agree that the British have got bases in Singapore for well over a hundred years, but I must ask - in all these years, what have the British bases in Singapore done? Are\r\n\r\nthey here against possible Indonesian aggression? No.\r\n\r\nIndonesia  became  independent only  during  the  last\r\n\r\ndecade. Did the British make use of military power  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to exploit us, economically and politically?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the last point that I raise will be of interest to the Minister for Culture. I hope that the P.A.P. will try some means to resolve these differences between Malaysia and Indonesia and improve the trade relationship between the two countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, why did the Indonesians want to\r\n\r\ncarry out confrontation? According to the Government's\r\n\r\nreport the Indonesians suffer more than we do. I  have\r\n\r\nsome doubts whether this is wholly a political matter.\r\n\r\nWhy  does  Indonesia want to oppose Malaysia?  Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  the first front-line is S.E.A.T.O.,  and  the\r\n\r\nsecond   front-line  is  Malaysia  which   serves   to\r\n\r\nsafeguard political and economic interests? If  it  is\r\n\r\nso, then we have to review the question of Malaysia in\r\n\r\nthe context of South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are countries which want to keep their\r\n\r\nneutrality, the U.S.A. is trying to safeguard  British\r\n\r\nand  U.S. imperialist interests. If they cannot  do\r\n\r\nso, then they will remove Ngo Dinh Diem and company so\r\n\r\nas  to  suppress the people. Now, when  they  fail  in\r\n\r\nthese  objectives, is this not what they want to carry\r\n\r\nout  in this part of the world, by using Malaysia  for\r\n\r\ntheir   purpose?  We  should  kick  out  the   British\r\n\r\nimperialists.  We do not want them to protect  us.  We\r\n\r\ncan  look  after  ourselves. If we  are  peaceful  and\r\n\r\nsincere in our negotiations with Indonesia, I dare say\r\n\r\nthey  will  not  carry on with confrontation,  because\r\n\r\nthey suffer more than we do by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Indonesians have much\r\n\r\nexperience in getting rid of imperialists.  The  Dutch\r\n\r\nwere making\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuse  of  West  Irian  to sabotage Indonesia  and  were\r\n\r\ntrying  to  undermine the social order  in  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  Indonesia is afraid  that  the  foreign\r\n\r\npowers are trying to make use of Malaysia to undermine\r\n\r\nthe security of Indonesia. If this is so, then we must\r\n\r\ntry   to  bring  about  negotiations  to  resolve  the\r\n\r\ndifferences.  They  should  not  indulge  in   abusive\r\n\r\narguments which are not worthy of themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> I hope that when the next\r\n\r\nBarisan  Member opposite gets up he will not  continue\r\n\r\nto utter a long string of rubbish --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

Furthermore, it is my most sincere hope that this House unanimously express our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Members, in the course of their\r\n\r\nspeeches,  have  made countless repetitions  of  false\r\n\r\nallegations   against   the  People's   Action   Party\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Their speeches were more or less  similar\r\n\r\nand  sometimes identical in many respects, so much  so\r\n\r\nthat we on the Government benches wondered whether the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis speakers were attempting to out-read\r\n\r\none  another. However, these repetitions only revealed\r\n\r\nthat  they  have  nothing concrete to say  apart  from\r\n\r\nglorifying   Indonesia,  and  that  they   are   still\r\n\r\nconsoling  themselves and nursing their  wounds  which\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuffered  at their unbelievable and miserable  defeats\r\n\r\nin the general elections last September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis Members have tried vigorously\r\n\r\nto shift the blame on to the P.A.P. Government for the\r\n\r\nunemployment  and  the Indonesian confrontation  which\r\n\r\nhas  resulted in an 8.7 per cent drop in our  economy.\r\n\r\nIt  is  actually the Barisan Sosialis who  are  to  be\r\n\r\nresponsible for these external threats. No one in  his\r\n\r\nproper  senses  can  forget  or  deny  that  Indonesia\r\n\r\nsupported Malaysia when it was first brought  up.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  Indonesia  saw  that anti-nationalist  and  pro-Communist elements both in Singapore and Sarawak  were\r\n\r\nopposed to Malaysia, they were led into believing that\r\n\r\nMalaysia  would  fail  and could  easily  be  crushed.\r\n\r\nConsequently  they  mounted  a  confrontation   policy\r\n\r\nagainst Malaysia. All these were brought about through\r\n\r\nthe instigations of the Communist Barisan Sosialis; as\r\n\r\na  result  of which trade relations between  Indonesia\r\n\r\nand Singapore were severed, thereby causing a drop  of\r\n\r\n8.7  per  cent in our State's economy and rendering  a\r\n\r\nfew thousand workers jobless. Our Government, however,\r\n\r\ntook   the   unprecedented  step  together  with   the\r\n\r\nemployers  concerned  to  pay  a  two-third's   salary\r\n\r\ncompensation  for six months for each worker  affected\r\n\r\nso  as to enable the worker to look for another job in\r\n\r\nthe meantime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a new nation, Malaysia today has to face both\r\n\r\nexternal threats and pressures. But if Malaysia is  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  and flourish, then I say it is the  paramount\r\n\r\nduty of every citizen in Malaysia to be ever loyal  to\r\n\r\nour  nation. In fact, the Indonesian confrontation has\r\n\r\ndone us a great service in further uniting the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was happy, Mr Speaker, Sir, when I observed\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  Members  taking  their  oaths   of\r\n\r\nallegiance on 22nd October, 1963, but today I am sadly\r\n\r\nmistaken. Why is this so? Because it grieves me to see\r\n\r\nthat on the one hand they swear allegiance and collect\r\n\r\ntheir  $500 monthly allowance as Assemblymen,  but  on\r\n\r\nthe other hand they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncondemn Malaysia as a British-inspired neo-colonialist\r\n\r\nconcept imposed on the people.

After taking their\r\n\r\noaths, the Barisan Sosialis Members have never at  any\r\n\r\ntime admitted that Malaysia exists. They only talk  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaya.

The  Communist\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Members opposite have  not  answered\r\n\r\nour  questions put to them. I therefore challenge them\r\n\r\nto  answer the questions again. (a)  On whose side  are\r\n\r\nthey  - on  the side of Malaysia or Indonesia?  (b)   Do\r\n\r\nthey  want  things to get better between Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia, or do they want them to get worse?

The\r\n\r\nallegations  are  absolutely not true.  In  fact,  our\r\n\r\nGovernment is trying to raise the standard of  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation  in Singapore; also it is a fact universally\r\n\r\nacknowledged  that  equal treatment  of  education  is\r\n\r\naccorded to the four streams of education in Singapore\r\n\r\n- namely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalay, Tamil, Chinese and English. There is also  free\r\n\r\nuniversal education for six years in primary  schools.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  marked difference in the  proportion  of\r\n\r\nstudents  in  the four language streams because  every\r\n\r\nparent in Singapore has a right to choose the type  of\r\n\r\neducation he wishes his child to pursue, and for  that\r\n\r\nmatter  they  are frightened by the agitation  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis in Chinese schools, such as  strikes\r\n\r\nby  students and examination boycotts. Every year more\r\n\r\nthan  40,000 children are registered for education  in\r\n\r\nprimary  schools  in the various language  media, and\r\n\r\nevery registered child has a place in school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is clear proof that the P.A.P. Government gives equal treatment in education. In the P.A.P. 1963 Election Manifesto, it was proposed to implement free secondary education as from 1964, but this proposal has to be postponed due to the setback in the State's economy as a result of\r\n\r\nIndonesian confrontation, which the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nproudly  claimed  in  their  Party  paper  that   they\r\n\r\nstarted.  Who are to be blamed for all this? Yes,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis of course, for this!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not trying to paint a rosy picture about the PAP. Government's past achievements, for they are all evident; but I have to state the\r\n\r\nnaked  facts in answer to some of the wild  and  empty\r\n\r\naccusations levelled at our Government by the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Members. It is also not our habit to  glorify\r\n\r\nour success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the rural areas are not forgotten. Rural development projects are taking place in almost every rural constituency. Kampong electrification schemes and street lighting are carried out. More public standpipes are installed; better kampong roads\r\n\r\nare  constructed; bridges spanning canals and  streams\r\n\r\nand  many  other social amenities are now extended  to\r\n\r\nthe  rural  folks.  All  these  developments  are  not\r\n\r\nbrought  about out of thin air as the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave   claimed,   but  by  careful   calculation   and\r\n\r\nintelligent planning on the part of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I once\r\n\r\nagain  urge that for Malaysia to survive and flourish,\r\n\r\nwe must be solidly united and ever loyal to the people\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia - not as the Barisan Sosialis are  to  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Communists.  We must  be  ever  alert  and\r\n\r\ncontinue to carry on the relentless struggle and check\r\n\r\nagainst  infiltration into schools, trade unions,  old\r\n\r\nboys'  associations and other civic  organisations  by\r\n\r\nthe  Communist united front cadres. We must not  allow\r\n\r\nourselves  to  believe  that all important  activities\r\n\r\nbeyond  our  control have now been shifted  from  this\r\n\r\nChamber to the Federal Parliament in Kuala Lumpur, and\r\n\r\nthat  we  can sit back and relax; but we must  persist\r\n\r\nvigorously  in our constant and unyielding efforts  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  a  prosperous  society  through  careful\r\n\r\nplanning   of  the  political,  social  and   economic\r\n\r\npolicies.  Only  in this way can we win  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nbattle for democracy in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As I have said, I notice that only two\r\n\r\nOpposition Members have not spoken. I do not want  the\r\n\r\nposition  to arise where all Members of the Opposition\r\n\r\nhave  spoken  and  we will then have  only  Government\r\n\r\nMembers  to speak on and on. So for this reason  I  am\r\n\r\nletting Mr Rajaratnam take the Floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the first\r\n\r\nbusiness session of our Assembly and it is an occasion\r\n\r\nwhen   every  Party  - the  Government  and  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties  - sets the course for the next few  years  and\r\n\r\nfor  the  future. So, I would like, as I said sometime\r\n\r\nago,  to give in all sincerity and without any sarcasm\r\n\r\non my part - the Opposition some friendly advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, listening to them with regard to this\r\n\r\namendment,  I have a distinct feeling that  they  have\r\n\r\nnot   thought  out  the  consequences  to   themselves\r\n\r\ncollectively and individually if they were to vote for\r\n\r\nthis  amendment,  which they have been  instructed  to\r\n\r\nbring  into  this  Chamber. So I propose  to  convince\r\n\r\nthem, so far as it is possible for me to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  so,  that  by voting for this amendment  they  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be trapped into a course of action  fraught\r\n\r\nwith  a  greater  danger than what their  predecessors\r\n\r\nencountered.  I  hope  that for  their  own  good  and\r\n\r\nwelfare,  they  will  give more serious  consideration\r\n\r\nthan  their predecessors did to our prognosis of  what\r\n\r\nis in store for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 23rd November, 1961, when merger was\r\n\r\ndiscussed  for  the first time, and  when  we  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side gave our reasons why we thought  that\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  and Barisan Sosialis  effort  to  halt\r\n\r\nMalaysia  would fail and end in disaster,  there  were\r\n\r\nmany  Barisan  Sosialis Assemblymen then who  laughed.\r\n\r\nMay  I quote, Sir, the concluding portion of my speech\r\n\r\nwhich I made on 23rd November, 1961? It is in Hansard,\r\n\r\nVol. 15, No. 7, cols. 547 and 548:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Anyway, it is my contention that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have miscalculated for the reasons  which  I\r\n\r\nhave  indicated.  Today  in this  debate  it  will  be\r\n\r\npossible  for the Members of the Barisan  Sosialis  to\r\n\r\ndismiss  them  as  fairy tales. They can  dismiss  our\r\n\r\ncontention  today  ..... that the Barisan  Sosialis  is\r\n\r\nfighting the M.C.P. battle against Malayan nationalism\r\n\r\nas  a fairy tale. But there will come a time very soon\r\n\r\nwhen  merger is finally realised and the M.C.P. gives\r\n\r\nthe  signal to launch a do-or-die offensive. [This was\r\n\r\nsaid,  Sir,  two years ago] ... When that time  comes,\r\n\r\nthe battle lines will be clearly drawn. There will  be\r\n\r\nno  equivocation then, because there will  be  no  no-man's-land.  There  will  only  be  a  thin  red  line\r\n\r\ndividing  the forces of Malayan nationalism  from  the\r\n\r\nanti-nationalist forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I said then:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When this battle comes, there will be no rescue\r\n\r\nparties,  because all the contestants will be  in  the\r\n\r\nbattle-field taking position on this or that  side  of\r\n\r\nthe line.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  prognosis was made two years ago. At  that  time\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis laughed it off as P.A.P. bravado.\r\n\r\nThey  then  jeered  back  and  claimed  that,  on  the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  it was the P.A.P. who would be washed  away\r\n\r\nby  the  wrath of the masses. At that time, they  were\r\n\r\nflushed with the victory which they obtained at  Anson\r\n\r\nby  the betrayal of one of their own colleagues. I may\r\n\r\nin  passing say that this act of political betrayal by\r\n\r\nthe Communists has been thrice avenged. The Member for\r\n\r\nKampong Kapor, whom they stabbed in the back, has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  returned to this Assembly! We have also regained\r\n\r\nthe  seat that we lost in Anson! And finally, the  man\r\n\r\nwhom  the Communists put into power at Anson  has  not\r\n\r\nonly lost his seat, but also his deposit!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at that time in November 1961, the Communists\r\n\r\nwere  so  confident of their strength that our warning\r\n\r\nof why they could not halt merger was disregarded. May\r\n\r\nI, Sir, make one last quotation from the prediction  I\r\n\r\nmade  then?  I also prophesied in the speech  which  I\r\n\r\nmade  two  years ago that some people in  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and - I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.... can opt out of the battle in the nick of time,\r\n\r\nprovided  they  get their timing right. I  understand,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  some people are already passing  the  word\r\n\r\naround  that they may cease being students of politics\r\n\r\nto take up law or medicine abroad.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Well, Sir, that has come to pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the Minister get back to the\r\n\r\ndebate?  He  has spoken on his previous  announcements\r\n\r\nand  on  two gentlemen. Unless he can satisfy me  that\r\n\r\nall that is relevant, I think he should press on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, what I would like to say is\r\n\r\nthis.   Once  again,  the  same  decision  that  their\r\n\r\ncolleagues made in November 1961 will have to be  made\r\n\r\ntoday  by  the seven Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen  and\r\n\r\ntheir   friends  outside  this  Chamber.  It   is   my\r\n\r\ncontention   that  being  anti-Malaysia  before   16th\r\n\r\nSeptember  of  this year is something  different  from\r\n\r\nbeing  anti-Malaysia  after 16th  September.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause,   to  use  a  Marxist  term,   there   is   a\r\n\r\n\"qualitative\"  difference between being  anti-Malaysia\r\n\r\nbefore 16th September of this year and today. I  think\r\n\r\nit  is necessary for them to understand that, because,\r\n\r\nas  I shall try to show, this adventure that they  are\r\n\r\nembarking upon is one that involves great risk. Before\r\n\r\n16th  September, opposition to Malaysia was  at  least\r\n\r\nsuperficially  an internal political  struggle.  There\r\n\r\nwas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  legitimate difference of opinion between Malaysians\r\n\r\nas  to  whether Malaysia should be set up and  whether\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and merger had the approval of  the  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Barisan  Sosialis  could  have   then\r\n\r\nclaimed   that  in  campaigning  against  merger   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia during the referendum and during the  general\r\n\r\nelection, they were engaged in a perfectly legitimate,\r\n\r\nconstitutional, and possibly patriotic  struggle.  And\r\n\r\nthe  price of defeat then, Sir, was at best a loss  of\r\n\r\npolitical  face  and of seats. But today,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid, there is a qualitative change. Malaysia has been\r\n\r\nset  up  with the consent of the vast majority of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  This fact has been endorsed not only  by  the\r\n\r\nelections in Singapore, Sabah and Borneo, but also  by\r\n\r\na  U.N. survey team. What is more important, Sir,  is\r\n\r\nthat  Malaysia has been accepted internationally as  a\r\n\r\npolitical reality. Despite the intense lobbying by the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  in the United Nations, the vast  majority\r\n\r\nof the 113 nations who compose the United Nations have\r\n\r\naccepted Malaysia as an independent political  entity.\r\n\r\nHon. Members opposite also know that the Russians, the\r\n\r\nCommunist countries - everybody - voted for Malaysia  to\r\n\r\nshare  a seat in the Internal Security Council of  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations.  This is a very  important  position.\r\n\r\nMalaysia    shares    the    seat    with    Communist\r\n\r\nCzechoslovakia. Therefore, internationally Malaysia is\r\n\r\naccepted  as  an independent nation. All these  people\r\n\r\nwho say that it is a neo-colonialist plot are ignorant\r\n\r\nbecause  the  113 members of the United  Nations  know\r\n\r\nthat,  by the rules of the United Nations, no country,\r\n\r\nexcept  an independent country, can be accepted  as  a\r\n\r\nmember. In passing, Sir, may I also observe that  when\r\n\r\nour  Ambassador in Washington sent out invitations  to\r\n\r\ncelebrate  Malaysia Duty, many East European Communist\r\n\r\ncountries attended the function to celebrate  Malaysia\r\n\r\nDay?  Therefore, Malaysia is accepted  nationally  and\r\n\r\ninternationally.   It  is  a  political   entity,   an\r\n\r\nindependent State. May I also point out that the eight\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Members took the oath of  allegiance\r\n\r\nto Malaysia? So\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neverybody  has  accepted  that  constitutionally   and\r\n\r\nlegally  Malaysia is a State. Therefore, in persisting\r\n\r\nin  their anti-Malaysia struggle, the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare now dedicated to the destruction of an established\r\n\r\nMalaysian  State,  a State to which  they  have  sworn\r\n\r\nloyalty,  and  which the vast majority  of  Malaysians\r\n\r\nsupport,  and  which is now recognised by  the  United\r\n\r\nNations.  That  is one qualitative difference  in  the\r\n\r\nanti-Malaysia   struggle   before   and   after   16th\r\n\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Barisan Sosialis will carefully follow my\r\n\r\nnext step of the argument because literally - Sir, I am\r\n\r\nnot talking metaphorically - it is a matter of life and\r\n\r\ndeath  to  them  if they do not know the  distinction.\r\n\r\nThey  may  accept or reject the essence of my  speech,\r\n\r\nbut  they  do  so at their peril. If they  persist  in\r\n\r\ntheir   anti-Malaysia  struggle  today,   the   stakes\r\n\r\ninvolved  are pretty high. The stakes are not Assembly\r\n\r\nseats  or  loss  of  political face,  but  the  stakes\r\n\r\ninvolved  this  time  are not only  their  patriotism,\r\n\r\ntheir loyalty to the country and its people, but  also\r\n\r\ntheir lives. To put it bluntly, Sir, the anti-Malaysia\r\n\r\nline  today,  i.e. after 16th  September,  must  lead\r\n\r\nlogically and inevitably to acts of treason. \"Treason\"\r\n\r\nis  not used in the rhetorical sense of the word, Sir,\r\n\r\nbut  in  its legal and constitutional sense.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to read the relevant portion on offences against\r\n\r\nthe State. It is the Penal Code (Cap. 121):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Whoever wages war against the Queen [this now means\r\n\r\nthe State of Malaysia] or attempts to wage such war or\r\n\r\nabets  the  waging of such war shall be punished  with\r\n\r\ndeath,  or with imprisonment for life, and shall  also\r\n\r\nbe liable to a fine.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not being frivolous about this. For the\r\n\r\nfirst  time  I do not want to taunt them unnecessarily\r\n\r\nbecause  this is a serious step they are contemplating\r\n\r\n- today  or tomorrow, when they have to vote  on  their\r\n\r\nown amendment. I shall try to convince them that it is\r\n\r\na  trap  or a noose set around their necks by the  men\r\n\r\nwho manipulate them. Sir, my thesis today is this:  to\r\n\r\nfight or to try to overthrow Malaysia is logically  to\r\n\r\ninvolve themselves in an act of treason;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis must become a party to treason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who direct the Barisan Sosialis - I am not\r\n\r\ninterested in the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen because\r\n\r\nthey  have been talking all sorts of frivolous things,\r\n\r\nbut  the people who really run them - have analysed the\r\n\r\nsituation  and have decided that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nand  the Communists of Malaya cannot capture power  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia either by violence or by constitutional means\r\n\r\nwithin  the  foreseeable future. Here is  evidence  of\r\n\r\nthat, Sir; as you know, the M.C.P. were engaged in  an\r\n\r\narmed  revolution for eight or nine years, and failed.\r\n\r\nAnd  they have admitted this failure. In fact, I would\r\n\r\nrefer the Barisan Sosialis not to my thesis but  to  a\r\n\r\nstatement called Ends and Means of Socialism which Mr\r\n\r\nFong  Swee  Suan and Mr Lim Ching Siong among  others\r\n\r\nsigned.  These two gentlemen, together with Mr  Devan\r\n\r\nNair and Mr Puthucheary, and others, showed logically\r\n\r\nwhy  it  would  be  impossible within the  foreseeable\r\n\r\nfuture for the M.C.P. to capture power by violence  in\r\n\r\nMalaya and Malaysia. This is even more important,  Sir - Chin  Peng  at the Baling Talks admitted  that  much.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  Tunku  put a point-blank question  to  Chin\r\n\r\nPeng,  \"Do you, Mr Chin Peng, regard me as a  British\r\n\r\nstooge?\", the reply of Chin Peng as contained  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper was, \"No, Tunku. I regard you as a leader\r\n\r\nof Malayan nationalism.\" This is the biggest admission\r\n\r\nby  the  leader of the armed revolt, a  man  far  more\r\n\r\nintelligent and far more dedicated than any  of  these\r\n\r\ngentlemen - that the Malayan armed revolt  had  failed.\r\n\r\n[Laughter] Sir, the Member for Jalan Kayu is laughing.\r\n\r\nI  ask  him  to read the memorandum contained  in  The\r\n\r\nBattle  for Merger, which is an analysis by Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong.  It  is a very important and a very intelligent\r\n\r\nanalysis  - why  it  is  impossible  for  the   Malayan\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party ever to capture power  in  Malaya  by\r\n\r\nviolence. So, Sir, armed violence is out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent elections and the referendum we have\r\n\r\nproved  another  point  - that  the  Communists  cannot\r\n\r\ncapture\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npower  by constitutional means in Malaysia. So  it  is\r\n\r\nout - the M.C.P. cannot capture power by violence or by\r\n\r\nconstitutional means. The referendum has shown it: the\r\n\r\nrecent elections have shown it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then becomes the role of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nand  the  Communists  in Malaya? They  cannot  capture\r\n\r\npower  by constitutional means or by violent means  So\r\n\r\nwhat  is their role? That brings me to the third  step\r\n\r\nof  my  argument - that the Communists and the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  can  capture power only by  aid  of  foreign\r\n\r\narms. This, Sir, again is not a wild allegation on  my\r\n\r\npart.  I  say that the role that has been allotted  to\r\n\r\nthem  by  their  masters, who  are  manipulating  them\r\n\r\neither  here or in Indonesia, is the role of Quislings\r\n\r\nor  Wang  Ching-wei.  It is not because  these  people\r\n\r\nrelish that situation but because they have no choice.\r\n\r\nThe  only  way the Communists can survive  is  at  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  foreign bayonets. In fact,  Sir,  the  real\r\n\r\nleaders  who write their speeches which are  delivered\r\n\r\nhere  by  their representatives knew as  far  back  as\r\n\r\nJanuary  1962  before confrontation started  - and  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  are  aware  of  this  - that   armed\r\n\r\nintervention  must  take place in order  to  break  up\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Many  of  us will remember,  Sir,  that  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  1962  the Secretary-General  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. Mr Lim Ching Siong, held a mass rally  long\r\n\r\nbefore  confrontation came into the picture. He  said,\r\n\r\n\"We realise that the moment is coming when we too will\r\n\r\nreceive  the  support and help of  other  peace-loving\r\n\r\npeople  to  free us from colonial domination.\"  Where?\r\n\r\nYou can look around, Sir. Obviously it is not America,\r\n\r\nnot  Britain,  not China as it is too  far  away,  not\r\n\r\nRussia. Which country is the peace-loving country?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>\r\n\r\nAcross the Indonesian Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Indonesia. In 1962, Sir, which is\r\n\r\nover  a  year ago, the Barisan Sosialis, or  at  least\r\n\r\nthose  who  manipulate  the  Barisan  Sosialis,   were\r\n\r\npreparing for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe time when foreign bayonets must save the situation\r\n\r\nand  continue  the anti-Malaysia struggle.  Again,  in\r\n\r\nApril  1963, that was before the old Assembly went  to\r\n\r\nthe  polls, there was a debate here when Dr Lee  Siew\r\n\r\nChoh,  who always reads other people's speeches, ended\r\n\r\nhis   speech  in  this  Assembly  with  the  following\r\n\r\nwarning.  He had lost the referendum and he knew  what\r\n\r\nwas coming; his masters knew what was coming. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the last door to constitutional struggle is\r\n\r\nclosed  to the people, then there can remain  hut  one\r\n\r\nfinal answer, i.e. the British and the P.A.P. rein  in\r\n\r\ntheir  horses on the brink of the precipice  and  turn\r\n\r\nback before it is too late.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  was  he  saying? He said that if  Malaysia  went\r\n\r\nthrough, that meant the constitutional battle was lost\r\n\r\nand  there  must be other means. What means?  Dr  Lee\r\n\r\nSiew  Choh is not going to lead violence. He is a good\r\n\r\nchess  player, I am told, and a bad rugger player.  He\r\n\r\ncannot lead violence. Who then? Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I could give other quotations. Therefore, Sir,\r\n\r\ntoday  this is their course - the course of treason  is\r\n\r\ninevitable. This amendment, Sir. All right, these were\r\n\r\nmistakes  of  the  past. This is  the  first  business\r\n\r\nsession of the Assembly. And this amendment. What does\r\n\r\nit  prove?  Does  it  prove  that  the  Barisan  have\r\n\r\nchanged, and realised, from their mistake, that it was\r\n\r\na  folly to fight Malaysia? No, Sir. Here is the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara's speech and an amendment  is  put.\r\n\r\nWhen a Party puts an amendment, it means that that  is\r\n\r\nthe  subject which it holds most dear. They  say  that\r\n\r\nthey   are   Malaysians,  shedding  tears  about   the\r\n\r\nsuffering   of  the  people,  about  housing,   roads,\r\n\r\nelectricity  and  kampong  people.  But  what  is  the\r\n\r\namendment  they  have  put  here?  Is  it  related  to\r\n\r\nhousing,  roads, houses for the people, sufferings  of\r\n\r\nthe  poor?  It  is an amendment that  relates  to  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of Indonesia. Let me read how it is  worded,\r\n\r\nthe  way in which it is worded. I do not think  it  is\r\n\r\nworded  by  them.  I will tell them why  it  has  been\r\n\r\nworded in this way. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` \"; but this Assembly regrets that the Government\r\n\r\nin helping to impose Malaysia....\" '.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nobody believes that Malaysia has been imposed.\r\n\r\nThere was a referendum and an election. But this is an\r\n\r\nIndonesian argument. It is being put here because this\r\n\r\namendment is going to be reported in Indonesia to give\r\n\r\nthe impression to the Indonesian people that there  is\r\n\r\nagitation  and a fight against Malaysia, and therefore\r\n\r\nthey  can  sustain  their anti-Malaysia  agitation  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, time is short. They must think why\r\n\r\nthey  have  been forced to bring this amendment  here.\r\n\r\nWhy have they been forced? They know the amendment  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be defeated. So why do they bring  it?  The\r\n\r\namendment will bring them into greater disrepute.  The\r\n\r\npeople   will  know  that  this  is  a  pro-Indonesian\r\n\r\namendment.  It will not be of great advantage  to  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  I will tell you  why,  Sir.  Their\r\n\r\nmasters, knowing full well that the course of the anti-Malaysia  struggle  must  lead  to  acts  of  treason,\r\n\r\ncarrying  penalties which I have  read  out,  want  to\r\n\r\nensure that these friends of theirs do not wriggle out\r\n\r\nwhen  the  moment of danger comes. Once  these  people\r\n\r\nhave   publicly  committed  themselves  to  this  pro-Indonesian  amendment, there is no  retreat.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat they want. They are helping to put a noose around\r\n\r\ntheir own necks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I conclude by a little quotation from The\r\n\r\nRevolutionary  Catechism which  has  been  praised  by\r\n\r\nLenin and which constitutes part of the organisational\r\n\r\nstyle  of  Communism?  One of the  first  things  they\r\n\r\nshould  note,  Sir,  is a piece  of  advice  from  the\r\n\r\nRevolutionary Catechism:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`All real revolutionaries should have second and\r\n\r\nthird  string  revolutionaries  under  their  command,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  they must be able to control those who are  not\r\n\r\nyet  completely initiated. These lower members of  the\r\n\r\nrevolutionary    order   should   be    regarded    as\r\n\r\nrevolutionary capital placed at their disposal. When a\r\n\r\ncomrade  is in danger it may be necessary to determine\r\n\r\nwhether he is expendable.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after listing the various categories of people\r\n\r\nwho   should  be  expended,  they  mention  the  fifth\r\n\r\ncategory which should be of great interest to them:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The fifth category of expendable people consists of\r\n\r\ncompromisers,    doctrinaires,    conspirators     and\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries. Those who orate away at  meetings  or\r\n\r\non paper, they must be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstantly driven into ambiguous positions. They  must\r\n\r\nbe  compelled  out into the open and assume  real  and\r\n\r\ndangerous tasks. The majority of these will disappear,\r\n\r\nbut    of    the   rest,   we   shall   make   genuine\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what is happening to them, Sir, the moment\r\n\r\nthey  approve this amendment publicly. They know  very\r\n\r\nwell  it  is  going  to  be  defeated.  But  they  are\r\n\r\ncommitted.  The  noose is round their  necks.  Treason\r\n\r\ncarries the death penalty. Sir, what the confrontation\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister is repeating himself\r\n\r\nnow.  He  talks  about treason. He has said  it  about\r\n\r\nthree  times. He talks about their putting  the  noose\r\n\r\naround their necks. Can we wind up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, it took two years for the\r\n\r\nformer  Barisan Sosialis to realise what we  said  was\r\n\r\ntrue.  This time, I can assure them, it will not  take\r\n\r\ntwo years. It may be a matter of months before what  I\r\n\r\nsay here will come true. I am prepared to stand by it.\r\n\r\nI  am prepared to quote it to the Gentlemen who may be\r\n\r\nhere  or  who  may not be here, but I can assure  them\r\n\r\nthat this prediction will come true, not in two years'\r\n\r\ntime,  but in the course of the next few months.  What\r\n\r\ndo  we  read  in the newspapers? Confrontation  means\r\n\r\nIndonesian terrorists going to Sabah to blow up things\r\n\r\n- sabotage.  We have read of Indonesian bombers  flying\r\n\r\nover  Sabah  territory with the bomb doors open.  This\r\n\r\ntime  there were no bombs. I read in the papers  today\r\n\r\n(this  is  the final quotation) Soekarno  saying  that\r\n\r\nthey must solve their economic problems (it is in  the\r\n\r\nMalayan Times today) within three months, which  means\r\n\r\nthat   economic  confrontation  obviously  is  hitting\r\n\r\nIndonesia  so  hard that he has given instructions  to\r\n\r\nend  the crisis in 90 days, i.e., three months. So  if\r\n\r\nthey   do  not  end  their  crisis  in  three  months,\r\n\r\nconfrontation can mean anything. But what it will mean\r\n\r\nto  the honourable Members opposite is something which\r\n\r\nI  hope  they  will  take into serious  consideration,\r\n\r\nwhether by voting for this amendment they are going to\r\n\r\nset  the  course to disaster - where the price is  very\r\n\r\nhigh - or whether, as I have said, they can opt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout.
