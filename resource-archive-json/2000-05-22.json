(Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. At the sitting of Parliament on 9th\r\n\r\nMay  2000, I informed hon. Members that Mr J B Jeyaretnam had\r\n\r\nfiled  a  Notice of Appeal to the Judge of the High Court  in\r\n\r\nChambers  against the Bankruptcy Order made against  him.   I\r\n\r\nalso informed hon. Members that it was not appropriate for me\r\n\r\nto ask Parliament to make a determination under Article 48 of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution as to whether his seat has been vacated  as\r\n\r\nthe Member had filed an appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeal was heard on 11th May 2000 and the Registrar\r\n\r\nof  the  Supreme Court has informed the Clerk  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nthat  the  Judge  had  set aside the  Bankruptcy  Order  made\r\n\r\nagainst  Mr  Jeyaretnam on 5th May 2000.  I have  sought  the\r\n\r\nadvice  of the Attorney-General on the effect of the decision\r\n\r\nof  setting  aside the Bankruptcy Order against Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nin  relation to his seat in Parliament.  The Acting Attorney-General has, on 17th May 2000, advised that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The effect of the Court setting aside the Bankruptcy\r\n\r\nOrder  is as if the Order was never made.  Mr Jeyaretnam  was\r\n\r\ntherefore not an undischarged bankrupt between the  period  5\r\n\r\nMay  -  11 May 2000.  It follows that Mr Jeyaretnam  did  not\r\n\r\nvacate his seat in Parliament on 5 May 2000.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VISIT OF HON.

Some adjustments would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary.  However, I gave the assurance that the Government\r\n\r\nwould  exercise  moderation in revising public  sector  fees,\r\n\r\nwhich it has done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government cut employer CPF contributions, we\r\n\r\ndid  not  impose  either  a wage or a  price  freeze  on  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  The  purpose  of the CPF reduction  was  to  reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs  and help companies to regain  profitability,\r\n\r\nbut  without making the labour market rigid or distorted. Now\r\n\r\nthat  the  economy is recovering strongly, we need to  manage\r\n\r\nthe  full  restoration  of CPF contributions,  simultaneously\r\n\r\nwith  wage  adjustments,  so that total  wage  costs  do  not\r\n\r\nincrease   too  suddenly.  I  believe  the  NWC  is  actively\r\n\r\ndiscussing  this  issue,  and will make  its  recommendations\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On prices, the Government does not approve or disapprove\r\n\r\nprice changes by private sector companies. During the crisis,\r\n\r\nmany firms held back necessary price adjustments, so that now\r\n\r\nsome  catching up is necessary. The Government  is,  however,\r\n\r\nmindful of the combined\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpact  of  individual fee increases on the overall  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving,  and  watches price levels to ensure  that  inflation\r\n\r\nstays  under  control.  In the case of  bus  and  MRT  fares,\r\n\r\noperators  have to justify the fee increases  to  the  Public\r\n\r\nTransport Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI estimates that the adjustments to gas and\r\n\r\nelectricity tariffs, bus and MRT fares, and taxi  fares  will\r\n\r\nincrease the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by only 0.22%.  Their\r\n\r\nimpact  on  the  cost  of living of lower  income  groups  is\r\n\r\nslightly higher - 0.25%. But overall, MTI's forecast is  that\r\n\r\nCPI  should  increase by only 1-2% this year. This  is  quite\r\n\r\nmodest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, 2% points of employer CPF contributions\r\n\r\nhave  already been restored in April. Given the tight  labour\r\n\r\nmarket, we can expect wage settlements to be generally higher\r\n\r\nthan last year. Therefore, allowing for inflation, most Singa\r\n\r\nporeans will enjoy increases in their real, disposable  wages\r\n\r\nthis  year. In addition, the Government has given rebates  on\r\n\r\nHDB  rentals, town council's service and conservancy  charges\r\n\r\nand  PUB  charges to lower income households.  These  rebates\r\n\r\nexceed  any  likely impact of inflation on these  households.\r\n\r\nThus,  while consumers will not welcome any new or  increased\r\n\r\ncharges,  however moderate, taken together these  adjustments\r\n\r\nare unlikely to impose hardship on Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, when I last asked the question on the  bus  and\r\n\r\nMRT  fare  increases,  the Minister of State  was  unable  to\r\n\r\nanswer  my  question  whether  he  was  aware  that  the  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies  had been making profits.  I have now learned  that\r\n\r\nthey  have been making quite substantial profits.   Does  the\r\n\r\nGovernment still think that it was necessary to increase  the\r\n\r\nbus and MRT fares?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member was not\r\n\r\nhere  when  I  addressed  this  issue  at  the  last  sitting\r\n\r\nfollowing  his  exchange  with  the  Minister  of  State.   I\r\n\r\nexplained that all companies have to make profits, because if\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  make  profits they will  fold  up.   Are  they\r\n\r\nreasonable profits or are they excessive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprofits?   That is a matter for the bus and public  transport\r\n\r\ncompanies  to justify to the Public Transport Council.   They\r\n\r\nhave  put  up a proposal and members of the Public  Transport\r\n\r\nCouncil  have scrutinised the proposal and they have  decided\r\n\r\nthat  these increases are fair.  I see no reason to challenge\r\n\r\nthat conclusion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister saying then that the bus\r\n\r\nand  MRT  transport should be run for profit  and  not  as  a\r\n\r\npublic service to the people who need to use them?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are tens of\r\n\r\nthousands, if not, several hundred thousand Singaporeans, who\r\n\r\nown  shares in SBS and there is a reason why we arranged  the\r\n\r\nscheme  so  that  the  shares are  widely  distributed  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  That is precisely because it is necessary  for\r\n\r\nall  services to run efficiently and one of the  measures  of\r\n\r\nefficiency  is  that  you break even and  earn  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nprofit.   There  are  subsidies which we  have  provided  bus\r\n\r\ncompanies - roads, bus terminuses, taxes.  But given what  we\r\n\r\nhave  already  decided they are entitled  to,  they  have  to\r\n\r\noperate efficiently and the measure of that is that they have\r\n\r\nto earn a profit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Two\r\n\r\nsupplementary  questions.  I would like  to  ask  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister if there are any coordinated efforts  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  for  example,  by way  of  an  inter-ministerial\r\n\r\ncommittee,  to consider the impact and timing of price  hikes\r\n\r\nfor  public amenities, facilities and services by the various\r\n\r\nministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that for the timing of future\r\n\r\nprice  hikes  within  the  control of  the  Government,  will\r\n\r\nconsideration  be given to take into account  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nsalary  increments and bonuses are usually given once a  year\r\n\r\nand  that there are still many months to go before the  year-end increments and bonuses materialise?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> On the first question, we do\r\n\r\ncoordinate  among the ministries.  We do not  have  a  formal\r\n\r\ncommittee, but we do coordinate among\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nourselves,  because it does not make sense  for  us  to  have\r\n\r\nseveral  sudden adjustments taking place one after the  other\r\n\r\nand  causing an unnecessary shock to people when very  often,\r\n\r\nin fact, there is no reason to be shocked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether we should therefore take\r\n\r\ninto   account  the  timing  of  the  private  sector  salary\r\n\r\nincreases which happen once a year.  I would suggest that  if\r\n\r\nwe make all our price increases once a year, that might cause\r\n\r\nbigger  shocks, rather than smaller shocks.  I do  not  think\r\n\r\nall  the  private sector salary increases take place  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time.  The NWC makes its recommendations in May or June\r\n\r\nand  companies take a few months, and some take many  months,\r\n\r\nbefore  they  settle the agreement and then  they  are  paid.\r\n\r\nCollective  agreements  come due  at  different  times.  Some\r\n\r\nbonuses are paid at the end of the year and some are paid  in\r\n\r\nthe  middle  of the year.  These adjustments are  spread  out\r\n\r\nduring  the  year and therefore price adjustments also  quite\r\n\r\nreasonably ought to take place during the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question, as I have pointed out, is whether the\r\n\r\ncumulative effect of all these price adjustments  is  a  high\r\n\r\ninflation  rate or a low inflation rate.  I have pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat,  in  fact, we have ended up with a very  low  inflation\r\n\r\nrate.   In  fact,  it was negative for several  years.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  it was less than 1% and this year we think it will  be\r\n\r\nless than 2%.  CPF has gone up 2% already - that is not take-home  pay - but I am quite sure take-home pay will go  up  by\r\n\r\nmore  than  2%  this year, because the labour  market  is  so\r\n\r\ntight.    These are adjustments which we have to accept.   If\r\n\r\ninflation  goes up 5%, 6% or 10%, then there  is  reason  for\r\n\r\npeople  to worry because that is very big and you are  unable\r\n\r\nto  plan ahead and maybe if oil prices shoot through the roof\r\n\r\nthat might happen - it has happened before - but that is  not\r\n\r\nthe situation we are in today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  whether  there  is   a\r\n\r\npossibility of giving off-Budget measures, such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas helping the lower-income group.  He has just said that the\r\n\r\ninflation rate might go up from 1% to 2% and, as it has  been\r\n\r\nin  the past, for  the lower-income workers who I have looked\r\n\r\nafter  in  the  trade  unions,  their  increments  are   very\r\n\r\nmarginal.   So  1% increase in inflation rate  could  have  a\r\n\r\nserious impact.  I would like to know whether there could  be\r\n\r\na possibility of some off-Budget measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we had\r\n\r\nbetter  understand that we are living in an unnaturally  calm\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs right now.  Inflation of 1-2% is actually,\r\n\r\nby  historical standards, quite low.  In Singapore,  that  is\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  been  able  to achieve  for  many  years  but\r\n\r\ninternationally 3%, 4%, sometimes even 5%, inflation  in  the\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries has been quite normal.  Maybe the  world\r\n\r\nhas   changed.    The  central  banks  have   been   careful,\r\n\r\ngovernments have been running smaller deficits and,  in  some\r\n\r\ncases,  surpluses.  Inflation has generally come  down  round\r\n\r\nthe  world,  also  helped by lower oil  prices  until  fairly\r\n\r\nrecently.  Because of that backdrop and also because  of  our\r\n\r\nprudent policies in Singapore, we have been able to keep  our\r\n\r\ninflation  to  1-2%.  Despite this, every  year,  during  the\r\n\r\nBudget,  because we have some surpluses, the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nhas  been  able to scatter confetti all around.  We have  got\r\n\r\nutilities rebates, service and conservancy rebates, CPF  top-ups.  As I have said, they all add up to a significant sum of\r\n\r\nmoney  for  the lower income group.  They are  not  meant  to\r\n\r\noffset  and make up totally for inflation, dollar for dollar.\r\n\r\nThat is not possible.  But taken overall, I think there is no\r\n\r\nquestion that they have enabled lower income Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nenjoy significant improvements in their standard of living in\r\n\r\naddition  to  what they have been able to get  because  wages\r\n\r\nhave been generally going up from year to year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nconsideration of much stronger than expected economic growth,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to ask the Deputy Prime Minister  whether  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  reasonable  to  expect another  round  of  partial\r\n\r\nrestoration of CPF within the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will await with\r\n\r\nbated  breath  the report of the National Wages  Council.   I\r\n\r\nhave no doubt that this will be a hotly discussed subject  in\r\n\r\nthe  NWC because we have published our first quarter economic\r\n\r\nresults  last  Friday and they have been good.   There  is  a\r\n\r\nbasis  and  I  am sure the unions will argue that  we  should\r\n\r\nbring   forward   the  restoration,  maybe   not   the   full\r\n\r\nrestoration,  but certainly to bring forward the  restoration\r\n\r\nto  some degree.  The question is what we see for the rest of\r\n\r\nthis  year, whether it will continue as strong as it is  now,\r\n\r\nor   whether  there  will  be  any  clouds  on  the  horizon.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, MTI's view in the first half of the  year  has\r\n\r\nalways  been  that the second half of the  year  would  be  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit slower.  That is a cautious approach.  We do  not\r\n\r\nwish to raise unjustified euphoria and we always want to be a\r\n\r\nlittle bit on the cautious side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask me now whether there is a basis to say\r\n\r\ndefinitely that the economy will slow down, I would  say  no,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot say.  But are there uncertainties?  Yes, there are\r\n\r\nsome  uncertainties, because it depends on  the  US  economy,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  showing  signs of overheating,  whether  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Reserve  Board will be able to moderate  its  growth\r\n\r\nwithout  precipitating a recession, which is a very  delicate\r\n\r\nbalancing  act.   It depends on whether the European  economy\r\n\r\nwill continue to grow strongly.  It is showing signs of doing\r\n\r\nso now and we hope it  continues.  We trade considerably with\r\n\r\nthem.   And  it depends on the Japanese economy,  whether  it\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to  pick up or whether the  beginnings  of  a\r\n\r\nrecovery  which  we have seen will peter out  again.   I  see\r\n\r\ntoday  Mr Miyazawa has said that the first quarter was  good,\r\n\r\nbut  the  second  quarter is a little  uncertain.   Plus,  it\r\n\r\ndepends on what happens in our region, Malaysia and Indonesia\r\n\r\nparticularly,  which is a matter of considerable  concern  to\r\n\r\nus,  and  what happens in Singapore, whether we are  able  to\r\n\r\nsustain  the  productivity growth  and  generate  the  higher\r\n\r\noutput  without our own economy overheating.   So  there  are\r\n\r\nsome  uncertainties, but I think that, overall, we feel  much\r\n\r\nmore  optimistic now than we felt a year ago and,  certainly,\r\n\r\neven six months ago.  And\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nso  I  look  forward  to  the  NWC making  some  constructive\r\n\r\nrecommendations in this respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Can I ask the DPM whether\r\n\r\nthe  economy is really robust because, from the ground, quite\r\n\r\na  lot of the other sectors are not performing that well.  Is\r\n\r\nthe  9% growth which was registered as robust as it seems  to\r\n\r\nbe?   Secondly, I want to ask the DPM whether he foresees all\r\n\r\nthese concerted price increases will drive up consumer prices\r\n\r\nand affect the ordinary wage earners.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The first question is whether the\r\n\r\n9%  is real.  Well, it is there, unless you doubt the number.\r\n\r\nDoes  that mean every company is doing well? Not necessarily.\r\n\r\nI know that some of the small retailers in the constituencies\r\n\r\nare  not  feeling as much of the lift as they  might  if  the\r\n\r\neconomy was just generally expanding.  But overall, from  the\r\n\r\nmacro  point  of view, it is quite a widely based  expansion,\r\n\r\nbecause it is in manufacturing, services, trade, banking  and\r\n\r\nfinance.    The   only  sector  which  is  not   growing   is\r\n\r\nconstruction.   But that is because we have  an  overhang,  a\r\n\r\ndownturn,  and that will take some time to turn around.   But\r\n\r\noverall, it is fairly broad based.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second question is whether we think these price\r\n\r\nincreases will drive up the cost of living.  I have given him\r\n\r\nMTI's estimate which is, despite the cost increases, overall,\r\n\r\nwe  think  the CPI will go up by 1% to 2% this year.   And  I\r\n\r\nthink that is acceptable.  I do not see a sudden spiral-up in\r\n\r\nprice  levels  unless we have some significant  difficulties,\r\n\r\nsay, with energy prices.  Then of course it cannot be helped.\r\n\r\nAnd  electricity prices are linked to energy prices.  If  oil\r\n\r\nprices  go  up,  somebody has to bear it and Singapore  Power\r\n\r\ncannot  absorb  it indefinitely.  So eventually,  electricity\r\n\r\nprices  have to go up.

In 1996,  we  launched\r\n\r\nthe  \"Back  to  Work\"  Programme  with  the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nProductivity and Standards Board, NTUC and Singapore National\r\n\r\nEmployers'  Federation.  This programme was aimed at  helping\r\n\r\nmarried  women  re-enter the workforce.   This  will  require\r\n\r\nemployers to adopt more \"family-friendly\" practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, our labour laws do not restrict\r\n\r\nemployers  from arranging any workweek patterns to  meet  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the companies and their employees.  In addition, the\r\n\r\nEmployment  (Part-Time Employees) Regulations, introduced  in\r\n\r\n1996,  provided greater flexibility for employers to pro-rate\r\n\r\nthe benefits based on the number of hours an employee puts in\r\n\r\nand  ensured  that part-time employees are  given  the  basic\r\n\r\nbenefits  stipulated in the Employment Act.  The  Regulations\r\n\r\nalso  allow  the  encashment of statutory benefits,  such  as\r\n\r\nannual  leave  and  public holiday pay. The Regulations  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  introduction  of  part-time  and  flexi-work\r\n\r\narrangements. Employers are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  introduce such arrangements so  that  married\r\n\r\nwomen   could   better  balance  their   work   with   family\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of family-friendly practices is not a one-off affair. It is going to be a long-term effort requiring\r\n\r\nthe  support  of employers and unions and their members.   We\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to explore all avenues to facilitate  married\r\n\r\nwomen's entry into the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  he would give further  assistance  through\r\n\r\npart-time  employment schemes and whether his Ministry  would\r\n\r\nfacilitate  further the opportunity for women  to  work  from\r\n\r\nhome or tele-commute?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, we do\r\n\r\nencourage  as many employers as possible to consider  tapping\r\n\r\nthe  pool of married women, the housewives, to supplement the\r\n\r\nexisting  workforce, and we encourage them to redesign  their\r\n\r\njobs  so that some of the jobs can be offered to women  on  a\r\n\r\npart-time  basis.  Some companies are already taking  it  up,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those  in  the retail  sector,  the  department\r\n\r\nstores.  I understand that some hospitals are offering  part-time employment opportunities to the nurses and I am sure the\r\n\r\nMember  would have heard about the offer by the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  of part-time teachers to work in the schools,  ie,\r\n\r\nto teach on a part-time basis.  As I said earlier on, it is a\r\n\r\ncontinuing effort.  As the labour market tightens up in  view\r\n\r\nof  the  economic turnaround, we are expecting more employers\r\n\r\nto have greater difficulties recruiting the workers that they\r\n\r\nneed.  So those who are more innovative will have to come out\r\n\r\nwith new recruitment offers to attract the inactive women  to\r\n\r\nrejoin the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether his\r\n\r\nMinistry  has new incentives, especially in areas  that  help\r\n\r\nwomen  harmonise work and family, to help them  stay  in  the\r\n\r\nworkforce?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the biggest\r\n\r\nincentive  to  an employer to go out and recruit economically\r\n\r\ninactive  housewives  is  in fact  to  fill  up  his  vacancy\r\n\r\npositions.   He gets the workers that he needs.  If  he  does\r\n\r\nnot  make that effort, he is going to be shorthanded.  He  is\r\n\r\nnot  going  to  be  able  to tap the opportunities  that  are\r\n\r\navailable.   Sir,  that will be the biggest incentive  to  an\r\n\r\nemployer.  But  of course, we understand that some  employers\r\n\r\nhave difficulties in re-engineering their jobs, for instance,\r\n\r\nand  making  part-time arrangement for their  employees.   We\r\n\r\noffer   through  the  Productivity  and  Standards  Board   a\r\n\r\nprogramme called the Core Skills Training.  If an employer is\r\n\r\nprepared to recruit a housewife for a particular job, we  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  help the employer provide the kind of  training\r\n\r\nthat  is  needed  for a housewife to re-enter the  workforce.\r\n\r\nThis   training   will  include  confidence  building,   work\r\n\r\neffectiveness,  computer  basics, communication  and  quality\r\n\r\nwork  principles.  We will support the employer with a  grant\r\n\r\nof  about  $350 per employee on the scheme which  includes  a\r\n\r\ntraining  allowance  of $100 to be paid  to  the  trainee  to\r\n\r\ndefray out-of-pocket expenses during the period that the  new\r\n\r\nemployee  is undergoing training.  This is just  one  of  the\r\n\r\nincentives  that we have to help economically inactive  women\r\n\r\nre-enter the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also offered a job skill training programme for\r\n\r\nemployers who recruit housewives.  This will cover up to  80%\r\n\r\nof the course fee for the specific job skill training that is\r\n\r\nrequired to help a housewife acquire the skills that will  be\r\n\r\nneeded by the employer in this case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> I was\r\n\r\ntold  that women in the high level jobs did not seem  to  get\r\n\r\npromoted  in  their career, and this is one of  the  greatest\r\n\r\nbarriers  why women do not want to go back to work part-time.\r\n\r\nAnd for those who have stayed part-time they feel demoralised\r\n\r\nat work.  Would the Minister comment on this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> I think we are on very tricky ground,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir.  It is not fair\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  generalise  that  women in the high level  jobs  are  not\r\n\r\npromoted  just  on  the basis of gender.  There  are  equally\r\n\r\nsignificant examples where women are in leading positions  in\r\n\r\nmany  organisations, both in the private and public  sectors.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is  not  fair  to comment on  that  basis.   But  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  our labour market is that many women  tend  to\r\n\r\nleave the workforce soon after they get married and started a\r\n\r\nfamily.   So  on average, if you look at the profile  of  the\r\n\r\nworkforce, you would see that women in Singapore earn a lower\r\n\r\nsalary  than  men  and some have pointed to  that  as  gender\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what it really reflects is that women are\r\n\r\nwithdrawing  from  the workforce.  So the average  experience\r\n\r\nlevel  of  women in the workforce is lower than  men  because\r\n\r\nthey  do  not work that many years.  If you average  out  the\r\n\r\nwages earned by women and men, you will find that men have  a\r\n\r\nhigher earning because they have more years of experience  on\r\n\r\nthe  job.  So it is not fair to conclude that women have been\r\n\r\ndiscriminated  against in this sense.  I would  say  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  generalise  on  this  basis.   There  are   many\r\n\r\nopportunities for women in Singapore to excel and demonstrate\r\n\r\ntheir capability to contribute to the company, and they  have\r\n\r\nrisen  in  their  ranks.   We  have  Japanese  multi-national\r\n\r\ncompanies  being led by women, we have local  companies  like\r\n\r\nthe  promising local enterprises and GLCs being led by  women\r\n\r\nand  we  also have Government departments with women in  very\r\n\r\nsenior positions.  We should look across the board instead of\r\n\r\ngeneralising   and  saying  that  women  are  somehow   being\r\n\r\ndiscriminated on the basis that they are women.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he would\r\n\r\nagree  that  childcare leave and third child maternity  leave\r\n\r\nare  good  incentives for women to balance between  work  and\r\n\r\nfamily and to remain in the workforce?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> There is a lot of flexibility, in\r\n\r\nterms  of  childcare leave.  Employers, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\nunionised  sector, do consider granting additional  childcare\r\n\r\nleave, especially in the case\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen  the  employee's child is sick, or for whatever  reason.\r\n\r\nIn  terms  of  maternity  leave, the law  provides  for  paid\r\n\r\nmaternity leave for the first two children.  Or in  the  case\r\n\r\nof  the third child, instead of imposing a requirement on the\r\n\r\nemployer to provide paid maternity leave, the Government  has\r\n\r\nprovided  a  whole slew of tax benefits for  parents  of  the\r\n\r\nthird  child.  The tax benefits more than offset the loss  of\r\n\r\nthe   paid   maternity  leave.   So  this  is  a   preferable\r\n\r\narrangement rather than to mandate that employers  must  also\r\n\r\ngrant  paid maternity leave to all employees in the  case  of\r\n\r\nthe  third pregnancy.  Because by doing so, we will  actually\r\n\r\nbe   shifting  the  cost  of  paid  maternity  leave  to  the\r\n\r\nemployers.  As it stands today, encouraging families to  have\r\n\r\nmore   children   is   a  very  urgent  national   objective.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Government has taken the  approach  that  we\r\n\r\nshould do so by giving tax incentives rather than to pass the\r\n\r\nburden  to the employers.  So if we want to encourage parents\r\n\r\nto  have  more children, we should not, in doing  so,  impose\r\n\r\nunnecessary  costs on the employers affecting their  business\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   Where  it  is  possible,   for   instance,\r\n\r\npromoting  and  encouraging a bigger family,  the  additional\r\n\r\ncosts can be borne by the Government by way of a special  tax\r\n\r\nincentive.

The penalty is a maximum 2-year jail  term\r\n\r\nor fine or both, depending on the gravity of the offence;.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Under the Housing and Development Act, HDB has the\r\n\r\npower to compulsorily acquire a sold flat when a flat lessee,\r\n\r\nhis  spouse or tenant or his authorised occupier is convicted\r\n\r\nof  a killer litter offence.  HDB can also acquire a flat  if\r\n\r\nthe  flat lessee does not comply with HDB's lease conditions.\r\n\r\nOne  such  condition stipulates that the  lessee  \"shall  not\r\n\r\nplace or allow to be placed anything or object in the flat or\r\n\r\nthe common areas or the building or any part thereof so as to\r\n\r\ncreate, in HDB's opinion, an obstruction or a danger or  trap\r\n\r\nto  HDB  officers, . lessees, occupiers or visitors . to  the\r\n\r\nflats  in the building\".

However, there is scope for some Town Councils  to\r\n\r\namend  their by-laws to make them more effective  in  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  the  problem.  HDB will work with the Town Councils  in\r\n\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to education and enforcement, I believe this is\r\n\r\na  problem that requires close and joint efforts of  HDB  and\r\n\r\nthe  Town Councils.  I understand that both HDB and the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  have  conducted inspections,  both  separately  and\r\n\r\njointly, to remove potential killer litter objects.  HDB will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  work closely with Town Councils and  carry  out\r\n\r\nregular  inspections  of HDB flats for  killer  litter.   For\r\n\r\ncases  under HDB's purview, HDB will not hesitate to exercise\r\n\r\nits  power  under  the  Housing and Development  Act  against\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant  residents.  Likewise, Town Councils  will  take\r\n\r\nenforcement action against households who infringe their  by-laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides enforcement, what is equally important is to\r\n\r\nimpress   upon   HDB  residents  that  they  have   a   civic\r\n\r\nresponsibility to others, especially when it comes  to  high-rise  living in Singapore.  In this regard, HDB has issued  a\r\n\r\npress  statement  and sent out individual  circulars  to  its\r\n\r\n800,000  HDB  households  reminding residents  not  to  throw\r\n\r\nobjects  from  their flats or place potential  killer  litter\r\n\r\nobjects   outside   their  flats.   The   various   community\r\n\r\norganisations, such as HDB, Town Councils and the  grassroots\r\n\r\nassociations, should all work together and see  how  best  we\r\n\r\ncan  bring  this  message across to residents.    Ultimately,\r\n\r\neveryone  has  a part to play in making HDB estates  a  safer\r\n\r\nplace to live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his\r\n\r\nanswer  and  I  agree  that   it  is  ultimately  the   civic\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the tenants of these flats  who  have  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the importance of this legislation. While I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  the Minister that most parts of the legislation are  in\r\n\r\nplace, there are certain anomalies that may not be clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can you please ask your question, Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Yes, Sir. There is a seeming\r\n\r\ninconsistency between the Housing and Development Act and the\r\n\r\nTown  Councils Act because, as he pointed out, section  63(2)\r\n\r\nsays  that there is a maximum penalty of $2,000 and  it  also\r\n\r\nsays in the Town Councils Act ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Sinnakaruppan, can you ask your\r\n\r\nquestion?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> The Town Councils Act says that the\r\n\r\npenalty  could be $5,000. The question is:  Who will  enforce\r\n\r\nit?  Will both bodies enforce the same offence and could Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  enforce  it  up  to $5,000  when  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Act only says that the maximum fine is $2,000?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I think this is not a question of\r\n\r\nwhether it is either HDB or the Town Council. It is important\r\n\r\nfor  both  the  HDB  and  the Town Council  to  look  at  the\r\n\r\nsituation and to see which is the best\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nway to  deal with the problem.  In so far as the specific penalty\r\n\r\ninvolved  is  concerned, whether it is $2,000  or  $5,000  or\r\n\r\nwhether it is imposed by HDB or the Town Council, I think  it\r\n\r\nis not the main point here. The point really is that there is\r\n\r\nsufficient power within the Housing and Development  Act  and\r\n\r\nthe  Town  Councils' by-laws to impose a sufficient deterrent\r\n\r\nto  potential  killer  litter offenders.   When  a  potential\r\n\r\nkiller  litter  offender  is  given  notice  to  remove   the\r\n\r\noffending  pot or other object and he does not  comply,  then\r\n\r\nboth the Town Council and the HDB can take action against him\r\n\r\nand  impose a fine. The Town Council can do so within its by-laws.  Some  Town  Councils do not have  sufficient  by-laws.\r\n\r\nDifferent  Town Councils have different by-laws.  So  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  things I have asked HDB and Town Councils to  do  is  to\r\n\r\nwork  together to make sure that the by-laws have  sufficient\r\n\r\ndeterrence.  Where they do, then I think the Town Council can\r\n\r\nand  should  take  action.  On top of that,  after  the  Town\r\n\r\nCouncil has taken action, if it is necessary and the offender\r\n\r\ncontinues to be recalcitrant, then HDB can also take action.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, has the HDB re-vested any flat whose owner had committed the offence of\r\n\r\nkiller  litter? Can the Minister also tell this House whether\r\n\r\nthe  flat belonging to the owner whose flower pot had  fallen\r\n\r\nand killed a girl recently has been forfeited?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, to answer the first question, since\r\n\r\nthe  amendment to the Housing and Development Act was enacted\r\n\r\nin  1986, there has only been one instance where the  tenancy\r\n\r\nagreement  has  been terminated. This was in the  case  of  a\r\n\r\nrental  flat. There has been no instance so far where a  flat\r\n\r\nhas  been  compulsorily acquired where it has been  a  bought\r\n\r\nflat.  In  so  far  as  the case that  he  has  mentioned  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  matter is still under police investigations,\r\n\r\nso I am not at liberty to comment on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nclarify with the Minister whether the killer litter provision\r\n\r\nin the Housing and Development Act is against\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlittering,  which means throwing something out wilfully,  but\r\n\r\nplacing  a  flower pot on the ledge of the  common  area  and\r\n\r\nthereby falling down may not be covered by the killer  litter\r\n\r\nprovision.  Is that correct?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think the Member may have\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  what I said earlier.  As  I  explained  in  my\r\n\r\nanswer,  apart from compulsory acquisition in the case  of  a\r\n\r\nconvicted killer litter offender, the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nAct also empowers HDB to direct owners or occupiers to remove\r\n\r\nany  object  which is placed in a manner which is  likely  to\r\n\r\ncause  injury  or  damage to property. So,  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Act does empower the HDB to act in that regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The penalty is different.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, the penalty is different. If the\r\n\r\noffender  persists  in  committing  the  offence,  then   the\r\n\r\npenalties  would be higher, and HDB will have  the  power  to\r\n\r\nimpose higher penalties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  urge  the Minister to seriously consider having clear-cut\r\n\r\nlaws.   At  the  moment, the way I see it,  there  is  a  gap\r\n\r\nbetween   the   present  Penal  Code  and  the  Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Act.  If it is like the case that  Dr  Wang  has\r\n\r\njust  mentioned, it turned out to be an accident rather  than\r\n\r\nan  intentional act to cause harm, then which  law  would  be\r\n\r\napplicable?   The  Penal Code may not be applicable  and  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Act may not have  a  strong  enough\r\n\r\ndeterrent.  I would like to ask the Minister whether the  HDB\r\n\r\ncould  consider  having clear-cut rules on how  a  tenant  is\r\n\r\nallowed  to  hang their flower pots, so as  not  to  cause  a\r\n\r\ndanger  to  the people around.  At the moment, there  are  no\r\n\r\nclear-cut  rules,  except to say that if a  flatdweller  puts\r\n\r\nsomething  in a dangerous manner, then he can be punished  or\r\n\r\nasked  to remove the object.  Maybe it is worthwhile for  the\r\n\r\nHDB  and  town councils to come out with clear-cut  rules  on\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Member making a speech?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether he would consider having clear-cut  laws  on\r\n\r\nthis  matter  and  also ask the HDB to make  it  a  clear-cut\r\n\r\nissue, ie, anybody having flower pots and objects outside the\r\n\r\nflat  as well as putting flower pots on ledges are committing\r\n\r\nan offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I would like to refer the Member\r\n\r\nagain  to that particular part of the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nAct  which  I read out just now in response to Dr  Wang.   It\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Housing and Development Act empowers HDB to direct\r\n\r\nany  owner, lessee or tenant of a flat to remove any  article\r\n\r\nplaced by any window or on any balcony of or outside the flat\r\n\r\nin  a  manner which is likely to cause any damage to property\r\n\r\nor injury to life.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, it is a very wide definition. What is it\r\n\r\nthat constitutes a danger to property or injury to life,  and\r\n\r\nin  what  manner is it to be put before it so  constitutes  a\r\n\r\ndanger?  It is worded very widely.  At the end of the day,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not think it is possible for any legislation to spell out\r\n\r\nspecifically the ways in which such objects, whether they are\r\n\r\nflower pots, bicycles, etc, should be placed.  And if you  do\r\n\r\nit  in this manner, you are committing an offence.  If you do\r\n\r\nit  in another manner, you are not committing an offence.   I\r\n\r\nthink there are myriads of objects which residents are likely\r\n\r\nto  place  in HDB flats which may cause injury to  residents.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it is all a matter of common sense.  If you  feel\r\n\r\nthat  putting a flower pot on the ledge is safe, then I think\r\n\r\nsomething must be wrong somewhere.  It does not take a  piece\r\n\r\nof  legislation in an Act to tell you that it  is  likely  to\r\n\r\nfall,  be  knocked over, be blown over and to  cause  serious\r\n\r\ninjury to somebody walking downstairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not see the need for us to spell it out from A\r\n\r\nto  Z  before residents would take notice.  First of all,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to educate the residents.  We have to make it clear  to\r\n\r\nresidents  that  high-rise living requires a certain  amount,\r\n\r\nnot  only of civic consciousness, but also of responsibility.\r\n\r\nWhen you are living 10-20 storeys up,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nanything   that   falls  from  your  flat,   consciously   or\r\n\r\nunconsciously,  is going to cause a lot of damage.   That  is\r\n\r\nthe first thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as do's and don't's are concerned, this is\r\n\r\nsomething the HDB and the town councils will be following up.\r\n\r\nIt  is  through the town councils, notice boards, newsletters\r\n\r\nand  so  on,  that we can educate residents on the  do's  and\r\n\r\ndon't's.    But   this  cannot  be  comprehensive   and   all\r\n\r\nencompassing.  There will be somebody somewhere who will come\r\n\r\nup  with something else.  Does it mean that because it is not\r\n\r\nin  the  Act,  therefore, he is able to  get  away  with  it?\r\n\r\nSurely  not.   So, I would recommend an approach  which  says\r\n\r\nthat, first of all, we make it an offence to either throw  or\r\n\r\nto  cause  objects to fall from flats, and to give power  and\r\n\r\nauthority  to  the  town councils and  the  HDB  officers  to\r\n\r\nrequire  flat  owners  to remove such  potentially  dangerous\r\n\r\nobjects,  if  they are spotted.  And if they  do  not  remove\r\n\r\nthem,  to  be  able to fine them.  And if they still  do  not\r\n\r\nremove them, to be able to take even sterner action.  I think\r\n\r\nthose pieces of legislation are already in the books.  Beyond\r\n\r\nthat,  it is a matter of education.  It is a matter of  civic\r\n\r\nconsciousness.  I think both legislation and enforcement  are\r\n\r\nimportant, but education is also important.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, what has the HDB\r\n\r\ndone  or how has it assisted the town councils on the problem\r\n\r\nof  potential killer litter before the incident  in  which  a\r\n\r\nyoung  girl was killed by a killer litter?  Second,  what  is\r\n\r\nthe  role of the HDB, in managing the estates, on this killer\r\n\r\nlitter problem?  I thought town councils are responsible  for\r\n\r\ntaking  enforcement action on killer litter offenders.   From\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's  answer, it seems to me that the  HDB  should\r\n\r\nalso  be  responsible.  What is the role the HDB  would  play\r\n\r\nunder the circumstances in such a situation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the town councils' responsibility\r\n\r\nis  enforcement of offences in the common areas.   There  are\r\n\r\nalso  offences  which  take place  within  a  flat,  eg,  the\r\n\r\nbalcony.   The  balcony is not considered as a  common  area.\r\n\r\nBut if somebody\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplaces  a  pot on the parapet wall of the balcony, then  what\r\n\r\nhappens?   Strictly  speaking, the town council  cannot  act.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I have explained to Members of this House,  there\r\n\r\nare  provisions  in  the Housing and  Development  Act  which\r\n\r\nallow  the HDB, if they spot it, to actually take action  and\r\n\r\nto  require them to remove it.  And if they do not remove it,\r\n\r\nthen HDB can take further action.  I see the HDB and the town\r\n\r\ncouncils playing complementary roles.  It is not a matter  of\r\n\r\nthe  town  councils alone.  The HDB should not  and  has  not\r\n\r\nabdicated  its responsibility and say that this is  the  town\r\n\r\ncouncils'  responsibility because the  offence  has  happened\r\n\r\nwithin  the common property.  Neither should it just  be  the\r\n\r\nHDB's  responsibility.  If the town councils  say,  \"Oh,  the\r\n\r\noffence is committed within the flat and therefore it is  the\r\n\r\nHDB's responsibility alone\", I also do not think that that is\r\n\r\nadequate.   So there is joint responsibility, as far  as  HDB\r\n\r\nand  town councils are concerned, not just in so far as where\r\n\r\nthe  offence  took place, but also in making  sure  that  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  well-being,  safety, security  of  HDB  estates  are\r\n\r\npreserved.  I do not see a demarcation of responsibility  and\r\n\r\nneither do I think it is a fruitful exercise to point fingers\r\n\r\nat  one another and say, \"This is your responsibility.   This\r\n\r\nis  not  mine.\"  So I would urge both the HDB  and  all  town\r\n\r\ncouncils  to  work  together to make sure  that  our  estates\r\n\r\nremain safe for our residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister has not answered my\r\n\r\nquestion on what has HDB done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am sorry. I forgot to answer his\r\n\r\nfirst point.  The Act has been in place since 1986.  And from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time,  I know that town councils do, through  their\r\n\r\nvarious publicity channels, educate residents on what  to  do\r\n\r\nand  what  not  to do, as far as killer litter is  concerned.\r\n\r\nThere  are  many other aspects of high-rise living which  are\r\n\r\nalso  important, but the problem of killer litter is probably\r\n\r\none  of the more serious ones.  And I know that town councils\r\n\r\ndo  make  it  a point, and HDB has also gone around,  through\r\n\r\ntheir  inspections,  to make sure that the  potential  killer\r\n\r\nlitter  does  not  happen.  But I  do  not  think  both  town\r\n\r\ncouncils and HDB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave the manpower or the resources to actually go around  and\r\n\r\npatrol 24 hours a day every single flat in every single town.\r\n\r\nSo  they  do  spot checks and when they spot check  and  find\r\n\r\nsomething wrong, they take action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 10 years, I must say that the number of\r\n\r\nkiller  litter  offenders has come down quite  significantly.\r\n\r\nAnd  the number of killer litter offenders the HDB has  taken\r\n\r\nto  task has also come down significantly.  But I think  that\r\n\r\nis  small  comfort  because it does  not  require  many  such\r\n\r\noffenders to cause a tragic accident, as we saw in  the  case\r\n\r\nof the Kent Road incident.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  killer litter has caused a concern  to  about\r\n\r\nthree  million  people living in HDB flats.   Most  residents\r\n\r\nhave  complied with the orders given by the town councils  or\r\n\r\nthe  HDB.  But there is still a minority of flat dwellers who\r\n\r\nplace flower pots outside their windows.  Should we have more\r\n\r\nspecific instructions on whether the HDB or the town councils\r\n\r\nshould  take  up enforcement orders so that all these  flower\r\n\r\npots  would  be removed immediately to avoid such unfortunate\r\n\r\nincidents from happening again?  I think we should not  leave\r\n\r\nthe matter to be enforced either by the town councils or HDB.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, nobody would be doing it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I reiterated just now, this is,\r\n\r\nin  my opinion, best dealt with both by the town councils  as\r\n\r\nwell  as by HDB.  I do not think that it is a matter of  just\r\n\r\none  or the other.  In so far as removing the flower pots  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  HDB  and town councils have carried  out  several\r\n\r\ninspections, especially over the last couple of weeks.   They\r\n\r\nhave  discovered that there are quite a few cases where there\r\n\r\nis  potential  killer litter and they have  taken  action  to\r\n\r\nremove  them.  And I am told that most, if not all, of  those\r\n\r\nflower pots and other objects have been removed.  So I  think\r\n\r\nthe  situation, as it stands at the moment, is that both  HDB\r\n\r\nand the town councils are working together on this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I would like to seek a\r\n\r\nclarification  from  the  Minister.   Is  it  all  right  for\r\n\r\nresidents to place objects in common areas such as the common\r\n\r\ncorridor, as long as they are not likely to cause damage?  Is\r\n\r\nit  all  right  to  place various objects  along  the  common\r\n\r\ncorridor?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, it is impossible for me to say\r\n\r\nyes,  it  is  all  right or it is not all right.   There  are\r\n\r\nhundreds of situations where such objects are placed  in  the\r\n\r\ncommon  corridors.  As Members know, if they have gone  round\r\n\r\non  house-to-house  visits, there are people  who  put  their\r\n\r\nclothes to dry in the common corridors.  They put their shoes\r\n\r\nand  unused  furniture  in the common corridors.   One  could\r\n\r\nargue that somebody could then take the unused furniture  and\r\n\r\nthrow  it  or  heave  it  over  the  side  and  therefore  it\r\n\r\nconstitutes killer litter.  I think the point is that at  the\r\n\r\nend of the day, all the town councillors and HDB officers who\r\n\r\ngo  around, they look around, they check, they inspect,  they\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  their judgment and where it does constitute  a\r\n\r\npotential  killer litter offence, they will ask the  relevant\r\n\r\nhousehold to remove that object.  But if the Member  asks  me\r\n\r\nto make a categorical statement to say, \"Yes, it is all right\r\n\r\nor  no,  it is not all right\", I am afraid he would  not  get\r\n\r\nthat answer from me.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, so far, we have\r\n\r\nbeen  talking  about  HDB and town council  regulations.

Today, I am happy  to\r\n\r\nannounce  the  new  \"Entrepreneurial  Employee  Stock  Option\r\n\r\nScheme\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee stock options or ESOP play a key role in a\r\n\r\nvibrant entrepreneurial environment.  Many fast-growing high-tech  start-up  companies attract talent,  not  through  high\r\n\r\nsalaries,  but  by offering stock options to  employees.   An\r\n\r\nattractive tax treatment of ESOP will therefore give a strong\r\n\r\nboost  to  entrepreneurship  and risk-taking.   Moreover,  as\r\n\r\ntalent is internationally mobile and is increasingly rewarded\r\n\r\nby means of stock options, especially in the high-tech start-ups,  we  must  ensure  that our tax  treatment  of  ESOP  is\r\n\r\ninternationally attractive, to give us a competitive edge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Entrepreneurial Employee Stock Option Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new scheme aims to foster an entrepreneurial spirit\r\n\r\nin the smaller high-risk companies and its employees, many of\r\n\r\nwhom  have  to  forgo more secure and higher paying  jobs  to\r\n\r\nstart or join these start-up companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Entrepreneurial Employee Stock Option Scheme,\r\n\r\na  50%  income tax exemption will be granted on gains arising\r\n\r\nfrom the exercising of ESOP.  The 50% tax exemption would  be\r\n\r\ngranted to up to $10 million of gains, over a 10-year period.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, if an employee exercises his stock options and\r\n\r\nmakes a gain of $1 million, 50% or $500,000 of the gains will\r\n\r\nbe  exempt from tax.  Over the next 9 years, he can enjoy 50%\r\n\r\ntax exemption on a further $9 million gains from ESOP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies with gross assets of up to $100 million at the\r\n\r\ntime the ESOP are granted will be able to benefit from this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscheme.   Based on the existing top marginal personal  income\r\n\r\ntax  rate of 28%, an employee can enjoy tax savings on  gains\r\n\r\nfrom ESOP of up to $1.4 million.  Coupled with the absence of\r\n\r\ncapital  gains  tax in our regime and our  low  personal  tax\r\n\r\nrates,  our  tax  treatment of stock  options  will  be  very\r\n\r\nattractive compared to most other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme has been structured with minimum\r\n\r\nrestrictions, so as to give companies the maximum flexibility\r\n\r\nto  implement  their  ESOP  plans  to  suit  their  different\r\n\r\nbusiness needs.  I will now go through some of the details of\r\n\r\nthe scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Qualifying Companies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of restricting the scheme to companies in\r\n\r\nspecific  high-tech sectors, which is difficult to define,  I\r\n\r\nhave  decided that for a start, this scheme will be available\r\n\r\nto  companies from all sectors.  Companies, whether listed or\r\n\r\nunlisted,  with gross assets of not more than  $100  million,\r\n\r\nwill  be able to qualify for the scheme.  In addition,  these\r\n\r\ncompanies also have to be incorporated in Singapore and carry\r\n\r\nout business activities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Qualifying Employees</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scheme is targetted at those employees who devote a\r\n\r\nsignificant  portion of their working time  to  the  company.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  to qualify, the employee must work  at  least  30\r\n\r\nhours  per week for the company.  An employee who works  less\r\n\r\nthan 30 hours for a company can also qualify if he spends  at\r\n\r\nleast  75%  of  his  total working time per  week  with  that\r\n\r\ncompany.   A  non-executive director will  not  qualify.   In\r\n\r\naddition, the employee should not control 25% or more of  the\r\n\r\nvoting rights of the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Effective Date and Timeframe for Review</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhanced tax treatment will apply to ESOP issued on\r\n\r\nor  after  1st June 2000.  The scheme will operate  for  five\r\n\r\nyears,  after which the Government will review the scheme  to\r\n\r\nevaluate whether the objectives of the scheme have been  met.\r\n\r\nMean-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhile,  during these 5 years, we will continue  to  fine-tune\r\n\r\nthe scheme as and when modifications are warranted.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Further Details</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the scheme, including vesting period\r\n\r\nrequirements  and  treatment of discounted options,  will  be\r\n\r\nreleased by IRAS by 1st June 2000.  They will be available on\r\n\r\nthe IRAS website.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Entrepreneurial Employee Stock Option\r\n\r\nscheme,  Singapore is sending a clear signal of  its  support\r\n\r\nfor  enterprise and wealth creation, and strong encouragement\r\n\r\nto  those entrepreneurs and employees who are willing to take\r\n\r\nrisks.   The use of ESOP is of course also relevant  for  the\r\n\r\nlarger   and  more  established  companies  and   should   be\r\n\r\nencouraged.   But  the degree of incentive will  be  less  as\r\n\r\nestablished companies have less problems with attracting  and\r\n\r\nretaining  staff.   My  Ministry will be  reviewing  the  tax\r\n\r\ntreatment  of  ESOP for these larger companies.   I  will  be\r\n\r\nannouncing the scheme for the established companies  in  next\r\n\r\nyear's Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my GPC for Finance\r\n\r\nand  Trade  and  Industry would definitely welcome  this  new\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurial   ESOP scheme, because we think  it  is  very\r\n\r\ngenerous and would be very effective in promoting the use  of\r\n\r\nESOP in companies in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister three questions.\r\n\r\nFirst,  on the rule that qualifying companies must be,  first\r\n\r\nof  all,  incorporated in Singapore.  Should we not  consider\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  other companies which are not incorporated  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  but have significant businesses in Singapore,  and\r\n\r\ntheir  employees therefore should be allowed  to  enjoy  this\r\n\r\nbenefit?  My other members of GPC will probably elaborate  on\r\n\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is on qualifying employees: Why\r\n\r\nshould there be a limiting percentage of 75% of the time\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspent  in the company?  There may well be individuals who  do\r\n\r\nnot  spend  their  time in one company but in  several  other\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Perhaps  a lower qualifying  percentage  of  51%\r\n\r\nmight be more reasonable for such cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point to ask the Minister is: Why is it not\r\n\r\neligible  for  non-executive directors?  These  non-executive\r\n\r\ndirectors may also contribute to a company and therefore they\r\n\r\nshould be able to enjoy this scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first\r\n\r\nquestion,  at present, the intention is to require  companies\r\n\r\nto  be  registered in Singapore to qualify  for  the  scheme,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  objective of the scheme  is  to  encourage  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of such high-tech entrepreneurship companies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Whilst I recognise that some companies  may  have\r\n\r\ntheir  registration  elsewhere  and  conduct  part  of  their\r\n\r\noperations  here, our preference is for them to be registered\r\n\r\nhere.  In any case, whether they are registered here or  not,\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  conduct  a significant  proportion  of  their\r\n\r\noperations  here.  For the time being, we want to retain  the\r\n\r\nrequirement that they should be registered here in the  first\r\n\r\ninstance.   If  there are specific cases  where  a  high-tech\r\n\r\ncompany  can  demonstrate that their presence here,  although\r\n\r\nnon-registered, can contribute significantly  to  value-added\r\n\r\nin Singapore, we may look at it on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the time spent criterion, this is intended to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  employees  spend  a significant  amount  of  their\r\n\r\nprivate  time  with the company.  The whole  purpose  of  the\r\n\r\nexercise  is to allow the company to attract these people  to\r\n\r\nhelp  in the start-up process.  If he dilutes his time  among\r\n\r\nseveral  companies, I do not think that will be very fair  to\r\n\r\nthe start-up company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of non-executive directors, the reason\r\n\r\nfor  excluding  them is that being non-executive,  they  will\r\n\r\nclearly  be unable to spend sufficient time to qualify  under\r\n\r\nthe time constraint.  Therefore, they should be excluded.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, two\r\n\r\nquestions for the Minister.  Will the scheme, as announced by\r\n\r\nthe  Minster,  be  applicable to existing ESOPs?   If  it  is\r\n\r\napplicable,  can a company then restructure  their  ESOPs  to\r\n\r\ntake advantage of the present scheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question is: How attractive this scheme will be\r\n\r\nis relative.  It is relative to established markets, like the\r\n\r\nUS,  UK or Hong Kong.  In other words, on this tax treatment,\r\n\r\nhow do they compare to these established markets?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> On the first question of whether\r\n\r\nit  is  applicable to existing ESOPs, no, it  does  not.   It\r\n\r\napplies to companies which issue employee stock options after\r\n\r\n1st  June.   Those who have existing stock options  will  not\r\n\r\nqualify for this special incentive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, I think our scheme is very\r\n\r\nattractive  compared  to  practically  all  other   incentive\r\n\r\nschemes,  partly because our basic taxes are low already  and\r\n\r\nwe  are giving a 50% reduction of that.  As the top level  of\r\n\r\npersonal  tax is 28%, qualifying stock option gains  will  be\r\n\r\ntaxed  at  14%,  which  is even lower  than  Hong  Kong,  and\r\n\r\ncertainly  a lot more attractive than the United States,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  where  the  top level tax is approaching  40%;  and\r\n\r\nsimilarly  for most countries in Europe.  So I think  we  are\r\n\r\nquite  comfortable  that  the  scheme  itself  will  be  very\r\n\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to thank the Minister for announcing the  scheme,\r\n\r\nand   I   think   that  this  will  really   encourage   many\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  to  have an alternative form of  compensation,\r\n\r\ninstead of a higher salary, maybe a lower salary and a higher\r\n\r\nincentive  in stock option.  This will help companies  to  at\r\n\r\nleast improve their chances of success by lowering their cash\r\n\r\nflow.   I have studied various stock option schemes and share\r\n\r\nownership  schemes in many countries and  I  think  that  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this scheme will probably be  the  best  in\r\n\r\nthe world.  I have a few questions for the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, will employee share ownership at inception\r\n\r\nof  companies,  that means these are not stock  options,  but\r\n\r\nequity  in return for expertise that you bring to the  table,\r\n\r\nbe tax exempt in the first place?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second question is: Will this scheme apply to companies\r\n\r\nthat  have  already gone public but have yet less  than  $100\r\n\r\nmillion   worth  of  assets?   On  the  point  of   Singapore\r\n\r\nincorporation, I support Mr Leong's point that more and  more\r\n\r\nof  our businesses are becoming very international, and while\r\n\r\nwe  may  have  the  intention of wanting to  operate  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  real value sometimes will  be  generated  in\r\n\r\ncountries  outside  Singapore, for example,  in  the  US  and\r\n\r\nEurope.   Therefore, I hope that the Minister can be flexible\r\n\r\non this requirement of local incorporation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is the definition of \"working hours\".\r\n\r\nIn  the Internet economy, we talk about 24-by-7, which  means\r\n\r\nthat 24 hours in a day are considered working hours.  So,  is\r\n\r\nthere  a  definition that the Minister will  place  on  these\r\n\r\nworking hours?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, are there any restrictions as to what ownership\r\n\r\nthe  employee  can have in a company, whether there  are  any\r\n\r\nconditions  on employee ownership of companies,  which  means\r\n\r\nthat an employee can own a substantial portion of the company\r\n\r\nin  the  beginning  and yet enjoy 50% exemption  in  the  new\r\n\r\nscheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Non-registration in Singapore,\r\n\r\nas  I have explained earlier, is a requirement to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe benefits of this ESOP scheme will accrue to Singapore  as\r\n\r\na whole.  Members have said that there are companies who want\r\n\r\nto  be  registered  elsewhere  but  continue  to  operate  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and I did mention that it will be considered  on  a\r\n\r\ncase-by-case basis.  If they can demonstrate that the bulk of\r\n\r\ntheir  activities is in Singapore, even though they  are  not\r\n\r\nregistered here, we might consider looking at it.   But  they\r\n\r\nhave  to be very sure that they are physically operating from\r\n\r\nhere, there are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  employed here, adding significant value  before  they\r\n\r\nqualify,  otherwise  the whole purpose  of  the  exercise  is\r\n\r\ndefeated,  if they register outside Singapore and  they  just\r\n\r\ncome here to take advantage of the ESOP scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On working hours, I know it is difficult to define,\r\n\r\nparticularly on the Internet or the info-technology  type  of\r\n\r\nactivity,  but our guidelines are flexible to an extent.   We\r\n\r\nwill see how this present 30 hours plus 75% work in practice.\r\n\r\nIf  need  be,  if  companies find that these are  awkward  or\r\n\r\nimpractical,  we  are quite prepared, as I said  earlier,  to\r\n\r\namend them as we go along during the five-year period of this\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of whether someone who owns shares\r\n\r\noriginally  in the company would qualify under  this  scheme,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  is probably referring to founder shares,  ie,  a\r\n\r\ngroup  of people get together to start up a new company,  and\r\n\r\nthese people then hold shares in the company in various ways.\r\n\r\nTheir  contributions could be through money or ideas, and  so\r\n\r\nforth.   But  these are founder shares.  If at  a  subsequent\r\n\r\ndate  they  resell the founder shares at whatever value,  the\r\n\r\ngains  would  be capital gains and therefore not  subject  to\r\n\r\ntax.   So  gains from sale of founder shares are  not  taxed.\r\n\r\nBut they do not fall under the ESOP scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the issue of ownership of company. We did say\r\n\r\nthat  they  should  not own more than 25%.  Effectively,  25%\r\n\r\nmeans  effective control of the company and we  do  not  wish\r\n\r\nsomebody  who  controls the company to  be  offering  himself\r\n\r\npreferentially  large  amounts  of  share  options.   So  the\r\n\r\nrequirement  is that he should not control more than  25%  of\r\n\r\nthe shares of the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> My next question was: does this\r\n\r\napply  to  a company that has already gone public?  Will  the\r\n\r\nstock option then also be tax exempt?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I did say that for those who\r\n\r\nhave  stock options which have already been issued, they will\r\n\r\nnot qualify.

Will those qualify for tax exempt?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Those would qualify.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, I welcome the\r\n\r\nMinister's  announcement that the scheme will be  applied  to\r\n\r\nall sectors without constraints.  But I would like to explore\r\n\r\nfurther with the Minister why the limit to companies  if  its\r\n\r\nassets  are less than $100 million.  In the market, there  is\r\n\r\nalready a migration of talent from the old economy as it were\r\n\r\nto  the new economy and typically, new economy companies tend\r\n\r\nto  fit this less than $100 million gross asset test and  the\r\n\r\nold  economy may be less so.  I am not just talking about the\r\n\r\nlarge companies, but even some of the medium size companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would appear that any differential tax treatment\r\n\r\nfor   ESOP  of  these  two  categories  will  exacerbate  the\r\n\r\nmigration  and  make  it  even harder  for  the  old  economy\r\n\r\ncompanies  to retain talent.  So the question I  really  have\r\n\r\nfor  the Minister is: why can the scheme not be open  to  all\r\n\r\ncompanies  in the first instance or, if not, at least  if  he\r\n\r\ncould  share with us why or how this $100 million figure  was\r\n\r\narrived at?  What is the thinking behind it and how soon  can\r\n\r\nthat  be  reviewed?  Does it have to wait for the  full  five\r\n\r\nyears?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> There is no magic formula to the\r\n\r\n$100  million  figure.   No one really knows  the  borderline\r\n\r\naccurately  as  to  which company should qualify.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nfigure we think is sufficiently large to include a lot of the\r\n\r\nnew  technology companies which we are trying to incentivise.\r\n\r\nWe  could bring the capital amount down so that some  of  the\r\n\r\nstart-ups which require less capital would be captured.   But\r\n\r\nwe  have to draw the line somewhere and $100 million is based\r\n\r\non  our  discussions with MTI who have a feel of the type  of\r\n\r\ncompanies they want to incentivise.  So it is an experimental\r\n\r\nlevel which we will be prepared to reconsider\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom working experience over the next five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is whether the scheme should not be\r\n\r\nextended to the established companies.  I did mention earlier\r\n\r\nthat  we  are looking at whether we should have some form  of\r\n\r\nESOP  scheme  for  these  companies too,  but  not  quite  so\r\n\r\nattractive as the 50% tax rebate.  Established companies need\r\n\r\nquite a lot of talent, but because they are established, they\r\n\r\nare  better able to attract qualified staff because they  can\r\n\r\nafford  to do so.  It is the new companies which are starting\r\n\r\nup  and  without a track record who will have  difficulty  in\r\n\r\ngetting  high  quality staff to join them, and usually,  they\r\n\r\ncan only attract them to do so by offering share options.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Can the Minister\r\n\r\nexplain  the  rationale of imposing this time restriction  on\r\n\r\nsomeone  who  qualifies for the stock option?  The  time  and\r\n\r\ncontribution are two different things.  A person may work  50\r\n\r\nhours  a week but his contribution is not as much as one  who\r\n\r\nspends 10 hours.  For the same reason, why is it not extended\r\n\r\nto  non-executive  directors because their  contribution  may\r\n\r\nsometimes  be more critical than an employee who spends  full\r\n\r\ntime in the company?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Time qualification is necessary\r\n\r\nin  order to ensure that the employee who is incentivised  to\r\n\r\njoin  spends a significant part of his working life with  the\r\n\r\ncompany.   Whether  the figure we have  used  is  the  proper\r\n\r\ncriterion,  I am not going to argue, because it is,  to  some\r\n\r\nextent, arbitrary.  But I cannot measure whether a person who\r\n\r\nis  spending one hour contributes more than somebody  who  is\r\n\r\nspending two hours.  This is again a very subjective  matter.\r\n\r\nBut we have to establish some criteria, in terms of time,  in\r\n\r\norder  to ensure that a person, who joins a company to  enjoy\r\n\r\nthis  incentive, devotes a significant amount of his  working\r\n\r\ntime  to the company.  If you get a person who may be utterly\r\n\r\nbrilliant  and spends one hour, but joins 10 or 20 companies,\r\n\r\nI  am  not sure that this is the group of people we  want  to\r\n\r\nincentivise.

It  also\r\n\r\nrequires  political parties, associations and  candidates  to\r\n\r\nreport large donations that they have received.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is an independent and\r\n\r\nsovereign  country.   Foreigners should  not  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ninterfere in our domestic politics.  It is no more legitimate\r\n\r\nfor   foreigners  to  pay  money  to  support   a   political\r\n\r\nassociation  or  candidate than it is for them  to  have  the\r\n\r\nright to support the associations' cause, or to vote for  the\r\n\r\ncandidate.   Any  Singaporean  or  organisation  that  allows\r\n\r\nhimself  or  itself  to  be  used  by  foreign  elements,  or\r\n\r\ncollaborates  or  colludes  with them  to  interfere  in  our\r\n\r\ninternal  affairs, is subverting the independence,  integrity\r\n\r\nand  sovereignty of the country.  We must not allow  this  to\r\n\r\nhappen.   Politics  in Singapore should be  for  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Singapore is not immune to foreign interference. We\r\n\r\nhave  had to deal with interference in our domestic politics.\r\n\r\nIn 1959, a Government Commission of Inquiry revealed that two\r\n\r\nsums  of  money totalling $700,000 were transferred from  New\r\n\r\nYork to Mr Chew Swee Kee, then\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nEducation Minister from the Singapore People's Alliance,  the\r\n\r\nruling party led by Mr Lim Yew Hock, then Chief Minister.   I\r\n\r\nthink  many  young Singaporeans do not even know about  this.\r\n\r\nThe  Inquiry revealed that the money was meant as a political\r\n\r\ngift  to  the Labour Front (and I quote the report) \"for  the\r\n\r\npurposes   of   fighting  subversion  in  the   colony\"   and\r\n\r\n\"strengthening\" the Labour Front \"as an effective  party  and\r\n\r\nbulwark  against  communism.\"  Then in 1976,  the  Secretary-General  of  the People's Front, Mr Leong Mun  Kwai,  who  is\r\n\r\nstill  around  today, revealed during Police's investigations\r\n\r\non  the misappropriation of the People's Front's funds,  that\r\n\r\nhe  was  given  financial assistance and made  use  of  by  a\r\n\r\nneighbouring  intelligence service  in  a  \"black  operation\"\r\n\r\nagainst  the interests of Singapore.  A more recent case  was\r\n\r\nin  1988,  when  a  US  diplomat  interfered  in  Singapore's\r\n\r\ndomestic  politics.   The  diplomat  actively  cultivated  Mr\r\n\r\nFrancis  Seow.  Mr Francis Seow was advised by  the  diplomat\r\n\r\nhow  to  establish a more effective opposition in  Parliament\r\n\r\nand   to   set   about  seriously  to  recruit   more   young\r\n\r\nprofessionals   into   the   opposition.    This   is   gross\r\n\r\ninterference in Singapore's domestic politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not condone such activities. Currently, we\r\n\r\nhave no law prohibiting foreign funding of political parties,\r\n\r\npolitical  associations and candidates  of  parliamentary  or\r\n\r\npresidential elections.  This Bill seeks to put  in  place  a\r\n\r\nlegislative framework to prohibit such foreign funding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is not the first country to introduce\r\n\r\nsuch legislation.  Many countries, such as the United States,\r\n\r\nCanada,  India,  France, Japan, Germany,  already  have  laws\r\n\r\neither prohibiting or regulating foreign political donations.\r\n\r\nHong Kong and Taiwan also have similar laws.  In South Korea,\r\n\r\nunder  their  Political  Fund  Act,  foreigners  and  foreign\r\n\r\ncorporations,  except foreign corporations and  organisations\r\n\r\nunder the control of nationals of the Republic of Korea,  are\r\n\r\nnot allowed to contribute political funds to any party.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  UK  also  has recently introduced a \"Political  Parties,\r\n\r\nElections  and Referendums Bill\", which amongst others,  aims\r\n\r\nto  regulate political donations.  It is therefore timely for\r\n\r\nSingapore to introduce controls against foreign funding.   We\r\n\r\nhave  studied  the  various examples in other  countries  and\r\n\r\ngenerally adapted the UK Bill to suit our local context.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Overview</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now give an overview of what our Political\r\n\r\nDonations  Bill  would  cover, before highlighting  the  main\r\n\r\nclauses of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill aims to prohibit political parties, political\r\n\r\nassociations  and  candidates from accepting  donations  from\r\n\r\nforeign   sources   by  treating  these   as   impermissible.\r\n\r\nPolitical parties, political associations and candidates  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  accept  donations, so long as  these  come  from\r\n\r\npermissible sources.  Similar to the approach taken in the UK\r\n\r\nBill, we have chosen to define who is a permissible source or\r\n\r\nwho the permissible donors are because it is easier to define\r\n\r\nwho  is  permissible  rather than who is impermissible.   Any\r\n\r\ndonations  other  than  those from  the  defined  permissible\r\n\r\nsources   would   constitute  impermissible  donations.    If\r\n\r\npolitical  parties,  associations or candidates  receive  any\r\n\r\ndonations  from  impermissible sources, they  would  have  to\r\n\r\nreturn the donation to the donor.  If they are unable  to  do\r\n\r\nso,  they  would  have  to  surrender  the  donation  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  Consolidated  Fund.   Political   parties   and\r\n\r\nassociations and candidates would also be required to  report\r\n\r\nlarge  donations, to ensure that they keep proper records  of\r\n\r\nthese donations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Who does the prohibition cover?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three groups of people who will be covered by\r\n\r\nthe   prohibition  against  foreign  funding.   Firstly,  all\r\n\r\npolitical  parties, such as the People's  Action  Party,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  People's  Party,  the Workers'  Party,  and  other\r\n\r\npolitical  parties registered with the Registry of  Societies\r\n\r\nwill  be covered by the definition of \"political association\"\r\n\r\nin clause 2 of the Bill.  They\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould not be allowed to accept foreign donations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, candidates of any parliamentary or\r\n\r\npresidential elections and their election agents  would  also\r\n\r\nbe  covered by the prohibition.  The prohibition would  apply\r\n\r\nto  both  candidates fielded by political parties as well  as\r\n\r\nindependent  candidates.   The  prohibition  against  foreign\r\n\r\nfunding   applies   whether  or  not   the   candidates   are\r\n\r\nsuccessfully returned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear why registered political parties and\r\n\r\ncandidates  should  be  covered by  the  prohibition  -  they\r\n\r\ncontest  in  elections,  and if elected,  can  influence  the\r\n\r\npolicies and political process in Parliament.  They can  even\r\n\r\nform  the government if they have the majority in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe  election  agent  is responsible for all  campaign  funds\r\n\r\n(under the Parliamentary and Presidential Elections Acts)  of\r\n\r\nthe  candidate.   It is therefore logical that  the  election\r\n\r\nagent   is  also  covered  by  the  prohibition  on   foreign\r\n\r\ndonations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third group covers any organisation, regardless of\r\n\r\nwhether  the  organisation  is registered  as  a  society,  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  or a company, so long as its objects relate  wholly\r\n\r\nor  mainly to politics in Singapore, and it is gazetted as  a\r\n\r\npolitical  association under the Bill.   To  leave  out  such\r\n\r\norganisations  from  the Bill would present  a  loophole  for\r\n\r\nforeign  interests  to  interfere in our  domestic  politics.\r\n\r\nAlthough the organisation's activities or objects may not  be\r\n\r\ndirected   at   procuring  a  candidate  for  election   into\r\n\r\nParliament  or as President, it can accept foreign donations,\r\n\r\npromote  a  particular political platform and  influence  the\r\n\r\npolitical process, but in the interest of its foreign  donor.\r\n\r\nThis  should not be allowed.  The Straits Times, in a  recent\r\n\r\narticle  on  13th  May,  \"Regulating the  flow  of  money  in\r\n\r\npolitics\" highlighted an example where a political party in a\r\n\r\nforeign country is under investigation for allegedly \"setting\r\n\r\nup    non-profit   organisations   that   channelled    large\r\n\r\ncontributions from foreign donors\".  Also, in Business Times,\r\n\r\non  10th  May,  and  in fact, in today's  Straits  Times,  in\r\n\r\nreports  focusing on the political donations laws in  the  US\r\n\r\nand other countries,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhighlighted  the controversy on the use of \"soft  money\"  for\r\n\r\npurposes  like \"party-building\" and \"discussion  of  national\r\n\r\npolicy issues\", which are not directly for election purposes.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  to confine politics to just contesting in  elections\r\n\r\nand   electioneering   for   candidates   would   leave   out\r\n\r\norganisations  who accept or make use of money  from  foreign\r\n\r\nsources  to seek to change our laws or policies, or decisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Government.  We have little control over  activities\r\n\r\nand spending by organisations unconnected with candidates  or\r\n\r\nparties during an election.  Foreign groups can, through such\r\n\r\nunconnected organisations, influence local politics.  Surely,\r\n\r\nthis  cannot be allowed.  Such organisations should therefore\r\n\r\nbe   subject  to  the  prohibition  from  accepting   foreign\r\n\r\ndonations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression \"relates wholly or mainly to politics in\r\n\r\nSingapore\" in the Bill is not new.  This is adapted from  our\r\n\r\nFilms Act.  Further, a similar expression - \"wholly or mainly\r\n\r\nof  a  political nature\", can be found in the UK Broadcasting\r\n\r\nAct  1990, and has already been subject to interpretation  by\r\n\r\nthe  UK  Courts. As regards political activity, we  would  be\r\n\r\ntaking into account whether:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the activity is intended or would likely to affect\r\n\r\nvoting  in  any election or national referendum in Singapore;\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the activity is, for example:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) an election or a national referendum in Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) a candidate or group of candidates in election;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) an issue submitted or otherwise before electors in\r\n\r\nan election or national referendum in Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the government or a previous government or the\r\n\r\nopposition to a Member of Parliament;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) the current policy of the Government or an issue of\r\n\r\npublic controversy in Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) or a political party in Singapore or any body whose\r\n\r\nobjects relate wholly or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmainly  to politics in Singapore, or any such branch of  such\r\n\r\nparty or body.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To define \"politics\" and \"relate wholly or mainly to\r\n\r\npolitics\"   as  referring  to  \"elections  or  electioneering\r\n\r\nactivities\" only as proposed by some civil society groups  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  too  narrow.  All we need to do  is  to  read  the\r\n\r\nWashington Post article as reported in the Straits  Times  of\r\n\r\n18th  May  this year and in it, there are details on  certain\r\n\r\ngroups, although they claim that they are not electioneering,\r\n\r\nnot campaigning for political party or activity or candidate,\r\n\r\nwho  are actually influencing the cause of the activities  of\r\n\r\nthe candidates or parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure transparency, the Bill empowers the Minister\r\n\r\nto  gazette  such an organisation as a political  association\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose  of  the new law  and  be  subject  to  the\r\n\r\nprohibition  against  foreign  funding.   Such  an   approach\r\n\r\nensures that organisations would be fully aware that, if they\r\n\r\nare  gazetted as a political association, they are prohibited\r\n\r\nfrom accepting donations from impermissible sources.  If they\r\n\r\nare  not  gazetted, then they are not required to follow  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding whether to gazette any organisation as a\r\n\r\npolitical  association, the Minister would have  to  consider\r\n\r\ncarefully  all  relevant factors, such  as  its  objects  and\r\n\r\nactivities,  its  links with foreign organisations,  and  the\r\n\r\nsupport it receives from such foreign organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Permissible donors</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clauses 8 and 14 of the Bill, political\r\n\r\nassociations  and  candidates  are  only  allowed  to  accept\r\n\r\ndonations from permissible sources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Singapore citizens, who are at least 21 years old,\r\n\r\nand   all   Singapore-controlled  companies,  are  considered\r\n\r\npermissible donors.  A Singapore-controlled company refers to\r\n\r\na company registered with the Registrar of Companies, and the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  its  directors and members are  citizens.   All\r\n\r\nother sources would be considered\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforeign in nature and deemed impermissible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, Singaporeans, who have attained the age of\r\n\r\nmaturity  of  21  years old and above, should be  permissible\r\n\r\ndonors.   Singapore companies are allowed to  make  political\r\n\r\ndonations,  as  they are our corporate citizens,  and  should\r\n\r\nhave  an  interest  in Singapore's well  being.   After  all,\r\n\r\npolitical stability is a key fundamental for economic growth,\r\n\r\nand provides the environment for businesses to flourish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unincorporated organisations are not permissible donors.\r\n\r\nPolitical associations and candidates therefore cannot accept\r\n\r\ndonations    from    these   organisations.    Unincorporated\r\n\r\nassociations  include  trade  unions,  societies,  charities,\r\n\r\nmutual benefit organisations, businesses, professional  firms\r\n\r\nand  so  on.   Trade  unions,  societies,  charities,  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit  organisations are set up for specific purposes.   As\r\n\r\nit  is now, most if not all of these associations are already\r\n\r\nprohibited  from  making  political  donations  under   their\r\n\r\nrespective   Acts   or  constitutions.    Sole   proprietors,\r\n\r\npartnerships  and professional firms have no  separate  legal\r\n\r\nidentities  from their owners.  That is to say,  the  profits\r\n\r\nand  losses of the business are the profits and losses of the\r\n\r\nindividual  owners.  Hence, if they wish to  make  donations,\r\n\r\nthey  should  do  so  as individuals, as  long  as  they  are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and are 21 years old and above.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Anonymous donations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill allows a political association to accept\r\n\r\nanonymous  donations of less than $5,000 in any one financial\r\n\r\nyear of the association.  Candidates can also accept up to  a\r\n\r\nsimilar amount of anonymous donations during the period of 12\r\n\r\nmonths  prior to his declaration made before nomination  day.\r\n\r\nThis  is to take into account that some well-wishers may wish\r\n\r\nto   remain   anonymous  in  making  donations  to  political\r\n\r\nassociations  or  candidates.  We have  chosen  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nlimit  of  $5,000 to strike a balance between allowing  well-wishers to make small anonymous donations and not opening  up\r\n\r\na loophole for significant foreign\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndonations to slip through as anonymous donations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>What is a donation?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill deal with the definition\r\n\r\nof  donations  and  how  the  donations  are  valued.   These\r\n\r\nprovisions  are  adapted  from  the  UK  Political   Parties,\r\n\r\nElections  and  Referendums  Bill.   Donations  are   defined\r\n\r\nbroadly  to include all goods or services, such as any  gifts\r\n\r\nof  money  or  property, subscription and  affiliation  fees,\r\n\r\nloans,  property, services and other facilities  provided  to\r\n\r\nthe  candidate  or  political association  that  are  not  on\r\n\r\ncommercial terms.  For example, if the goods or services  are\r\n\r\nrendered  to a political association at less than  commercial\r\n\r\nrates,  the  value  of the donation would be  the  difference\r\n\r\nbetween the actual cost to the association and the cost which\r\n\r\nthe  association would have incurred if it had been  provided\r\n\r\non commercial terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donations would not include any notional benefits of\r\n\r\nairtime  during  lawful party political  broadcasts,  or  any\r\n\r\npostage-free elections communications authorized  by  written\r\n\r\nlaw.   These  benefits  are granted by  or  pursuant  to  our\r\n\r\nwritten laws, and would not be considered as donations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the UK Bill, donations would also not include any\r\n\r\nvoluntary services by an individual.  It is neither practical\r\n\r\nnor  feasible  to  put  a value to voluntary  services.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  if  an  individual contributes, in  his  own  time,\r\n\r\nprofessional  services within his own  sphere  of  expertise,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  accounting  expertise, to a political  party,  this\r\n\r\nservice  would not be regarded as a donation.   He  could  be\r\n\r\nself-employed,  or he could take leave from his  employer  to\r\n\r\nprovide  his service to the political party.  As long  as  he\r\n\r\nvolunteers  his  services in his own time, it  would  not  be\r\n\r\nregarded as a donation.  However, if the individual  is  paid\r\n\r\nby  his  employer  while providing services  to  a  political\r\n\r\nparty, the services would count as a donation by the employer\r\n\r\nto  the  political party.  The value of the donation  is  the\r\n\r\ncommercial rate of providing the services.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>What  should  a  political  party  or  a  candidate  do  upon receiving a donation?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 15 of the Bill require every political\r\n\r\nassociation  or candidate or his election agent to  take  all\r\n\r\nreasonable  steps  to  identify the donor  and  to  determine\r\n\r\nwhether the donor is a permissible donor before accepting any\r\n\r\ndonation received.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the donation is from an impermissible source, the\r\n\r\npolitical  association, candidate or his election agent  must\r\n\r\nreturn the donation to the foreign source. If that cannot  be\r\n\r\ndone,  the  donation  must  be returned  to  the  person  who\r\n\r\ntransmitted  the donation or to the bank, if  the  money  was\r\n\r\ndrawn  from  a  bank.   If  that is also  not  possible,  the\r\n\r\ndonation  must be surrendered to the Registrar  of  Political\r\n\r\nDonations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a political association receives an anonymous\r\n\r\ndonation,  it must ensure that it has not accepted $5,000  or\r\n\r\nmore  of  such  donations  in  the  year  in  question.   Any\r\n\r\nanonymous donations above the allowed limit must be  returned\r\n\r\neither  to the person who transmitted it or the bank,  or  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  resort,  surrender it to the  Registrar.   Similar\r\n\r\nprovisions  operate  with regard to candidates  and  election\r\n\r\nagents receiving anonymous donations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reporting of Donations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill provides for political associations and\r\n\r\ncandidates  of  parliamentary or  presidential  elections  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  a  donation  report  and a declaration  on  political\r\n\r\ndonations  to  the  Registrar  of  Political  Donations.   By\r\n\r\nrequiring  a  declaration  to be submitted  with  a  donation\r\n\r\nreport,   it  would  obviate  the  need  for  the   political\r\n\r\nassociations   to  list  all  donations,   which   would   be\r\n\r\nadministratively tedious.  The declaration would  state  that\r\n\r\nthe  political  association or candidate did not  accept  any\r\n\r\nforeign  donations as well as anonymous donations beyond  the\r\n\r\npermissible   limit,   ie,  less  than   $5,000.    Political\r\n\r\nassociations and candidates need to list only large donations\r\n\r\nof $10,000 or above in the donation report.  This reporting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrequirement   ensures   that   political   associations   and\r\n\r\ncandidates  keep proper records of the donations  which  they\r\n\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate on the reporting requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Political Associations</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clauses 12 and 13 of the Bill require political\r\n\r\nassociations to submit a donation report and a declaration to\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar within 31 days from the close of its financial\r\n\r\nyear.   This is similar to current practice whereby political\r\n\r\nparties  are  already  required under the  Societies  Act  to\r\n\r\nsubmit their annual returns and statement of accounts to  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Societies within 31 days from the close of their\r\n\r\nfinancial  year or the Annual General Meeting,  if  there  is\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political association should list in the donation\r\n\r\nreport  all  donations of $10,000 or more, whether  it  is  a\r\n\r\nsingle  donation,  or  a series of donations  from  the  same\r\n\r\nsource,  which  adds  up  to  $10,000  or  more  during  that\r\n\r\nfinancial  year.   For example, if the political  association\r\n\r\naccepts  three donations from the same individual donor,  and\r\n\r\nthe  three  donations  add up to more  than  $10,000  in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year, the political association should also  record\r\n\r\nthis series of donations in the donation report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political association would also have to submit a\r\n\r\ndeclaration with the donation report that it has not received\r\n\r\nany   donations  from  impermissible  sources,  as  well   as\r\n\r\nanonymous donations beyond the permissible limit of $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The president, the secretary and the treasurer are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the preparation and accuracy of the  report.\r\n\r\nThe  president, the secretary and the treasurer are  the  key\r\n\r\nofficers of a political association, and should therefore  be\r\n\r\nresponsible for the political donations.  They have to ensure\r\n\r\nthat the donation report and the declaration are submitted on\r\n\r\ntime,  and  declare that the donation report is complete  and\r\n\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Candidates</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 18 of the Bill requires every person who\r\n\r\nintends  to  take  part in any parliamentary or  Presidential\r\n\r\nelection to submit to the Registrar a similar donation report\r\n\r\nand declaration.  The donation report and declaration are  to\r\n\r\nbe  made after the issue of the writ of election, and sent to\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar of Political Donations at least two clear days\r\n\r\nbefore Nomination Day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The donation report and declaration by a prospective\r\n\r\ncandidate  are  similar to those by a political  association.\r\n\r\nThat  is, the prospective candidate must list in the donation\r\n\r\nreport  all  single donations of $10,000  or  more,  and  any\r\n\r\nseries  of  donations from the same permissible source  which\r\n\r\nadds  up  to  $10,000  or more, for the  year  prior  to  his\r\n\r\ndeclaration.  He would state in the accompanying  declaration\r\n\r\nthat  the donation report is accurate and complete, and  that\r\n\r\nhe  has not accepted donations from impermissible sources  as\r\n\r\nwell  as anonymous donations beyond the permissible limit  of\r\n\r\n$5,000.   Thereafter, the Registrar would issue  a  political\r\n\r\ndonation certificate to the candidate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The candidate is then required to submit the political\r\n\r\ndonation certificate, together with his other papers required\r\n\r\nfor   nomination  purposes,  to  the  Returning  Officer   on\r\n\r\nNomination  Day.  The nomination of his candidacy would  only\r\n\r\nbe   accepted  if  he  can  present  the  political  donation\r\n\r\ncertificate  together with his nomination  papers  and  other\r\n\r\nlegal requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the election, the candidate and his election agent\r\n\r\nwould  be required to submit to the Registrar within 31  days\r\n\r\nof  the  declaration of election results, a  second  donation\r\n\r\nreport  and  declaration.  This second report and declaration\r\n\r\nare  similar  to  the first declaration and donation  report,\r\n\r\nexcept  that it covers the period from the time of the  first\r\n\r\nreport  to the time of the second report.  This second report\r\n\r\nis  necessary,  as  in practice the candidate  is  likely  to\r\n\r\nreceive  donations  during this second  period,  when  he  is\r\n\r\ncampaigning for the elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Donors</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 of the Bill requires donors of \"multiple small\r\n\r\ndonations\" to political associations, which add up to $10,000\r\n\r\nor more in a calendar year, to report to the Registrar.  This\r\n\r\nis a counter-evasion measure.  It helps the Registrar to keep\r\n\r\ntrack  of  small  multiple  donations  that  add  up   to   a\r\n\r\nsignificant  amount of $10,000 within a short period  of  one\r\n\r\nyear.  The reporting requirement will also lessen the tedious\r\n\r\ntask of verifying such donations.  A donor would not need  to\r\n\r\ndeclare  if  the  total donation is less than  $10,000  in  a\r\n\r\ncalendar year.  He also would not need to declare if he  made\r\n\r\na  single  donation, or a few donations,  each  of  which  is\r\n\r\n$10,000  or  more.   In this case, the political  association\r\n\r\nshould  have captured these donations in the donation report.\r\n\r\nA similar requirement can also be found in the UK Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reports Not Open to Public Inspection</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The donation reports submitted to the Registrar of\r\n\r\nPolitical  Donations  would  not  be  open  to  the   public.\r\n\r\nAllowing  public  inspection of the  donation  reports  could\r\n\r\ninhibit   permissible  donors  from  donating  to   political\r\n\r\nassociations or candidates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is now, political parties, like all other\r\n\r\nregistered  societies, are required to submit annual  returns\r\n\r\nand  statement of accounts to the Registrar of Societies  and\r\n\r\nthese  annual returns and statement of accounts are also  not\r\n\r\navailable for public inspection.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Offences</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the offences under the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under this Bill, accepting foreign donations per se\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  an  offence.  Instead, the foreign  donations\r\n\r\nwould just be forfeited if they are not or cannot be returned\r\n\r\nto  the  donor.   Clauses 11 and 17 of the  Bill  enable  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Prosecutor to apply to a District Court to order  the\r\n\r\nforfeiture of a donation from an impermissible source which a\r\n\r\npolitical  association or a candidate or his  election  agent\r\n\r\nhas accepted.  Clauses 11 and 17 also provide\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  appeals  to the High Court against the decision  of  the\r\n\r\nDistrict Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the responsible officers of a political\r\n\r\nassociation or a candidate or his election agent would commit\r\n\r\nan  offence  if  any  of  them makes a false  declaration  in\r\n\r\nrelation to political donations.  For example, if a political\r\n\r\nassociation  accepts a foreign donation but  the  declaration\r\n\r\naccompanying the donation report declares otherwise, each  of\r\n\r\nthe  responsible officers would have committed an offence  of\r\n\r\nfalse  declaration, unless he can show that he did  not  know\r\n\r\nand  could not reasonably have known that the declaration was\r\n\r\nfalse.  This is reasonable since the political association is\r\n\r\nin  the  best position to know the circumstances under  which\r\n\r\nthe donations were received.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If convicted of false declaration, then each of the\r\n\r\nresponsible  officers of the political association  would  be\r\n\r\nliable  to  a fine of not exceeding $5,000 or an imprisonment\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding 6 months, or to both.  Repeat offenders  would\r\n\r\nface higher penalties  -  a fine not exceeding $20,000 or  an\r\n\r\nimprisonment not exceeding 3 years, or to both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, it would be an offence if political\r\n\r\nassociations and candidates and their election agents do  not\r\n\r\nsubmit  the  donation  reports  and  declaration  within  the\r\n\r\nstipulated  time, for example, for the political association,\r\n\r\nit   would  be  within  31  days  from  the  close   of   the\r\n\r\nassociation's  financial year.  If  convicted,  each  of  the\r\n\r\nresponsible  officers of the political association  would  be\r\n\r\nliable to a fine of up to $2,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 of the Bill makes it an offence for a person\r\n\r\nto   facilitate   the   evasion  of   the   restrictions   on\r\n\r\nimpermissible donations.  For example, if an individual,  who\r\n\r\nis  a  permissible donor, accepts money from an impermissible\r\n\r\ndonor  and  donates the money to a political  association  to\r\n\r\ncircumvent  the prohibition, the person would have  committed\r\n\r\nan  offence.  He would be liable upon conviction to a fine of\r\n\r\nnot more than $3,000, or to imprisonment for not more than 12\r\n\r\nmonths, or to both.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 30 of the Bill makes it an offence to alter,\r\n\r\nsuppress or destroy any document he is required to produce to\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar,  with a view to evade the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 of the Bill empowers the Registrar to compound\r\n\r\nany offence under the Act.  This provides the flexibility for\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar to offer composition of not more than $500 for\r\n\r\nthe  less  serious offences.  Offences which carry  a  mental\r\n\r\nelement, such as false declaration of donations, facilitating\r\n\r\nin   the   evasion  of  the  restrictions  on   impermissible\r\n\r\ndonations,  would not be made compoundable.   As  per  normal\r\n\r\npractice,  the  compoundable offences would be prescribed  by\r\n\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consequential Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clauses 36 and 37 of the Bill make related\r\n\r\namendments  to  the  Parliamentary  Elections  Act  and   the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Elections Act.  A prospective  candidate  would\r\n\r\nhave  to deliver to the Returning Officer, together with  his\r\n\r\nnomination  papers  on nomination day, a  political  donation\r\n\r\ncertificate  issued by the Registrar of Political  Donations.\r\n\r\nIf  he fails to do so, his nomination would be rendered  void\r\n\r\nand may be rejected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill aims to keep foreign interference out of\r\n\r\nour   domestic  political  process.   It  does  not   prevent\r\n\r\npolitical   associations   and  candidates   from   accepting\r\n\r\ndonations, so long as the donations are from Singaporeans  or\r\n\r\nSingapore-controlled companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drafting the Bill, we have kept the framework as\r\n\r\nsimple as possible.  No doubt, the associations would have to\r\n\r\nput  in  some effort to account for the donations  that  they\r\n\r\nreceive.   But  this small effort would  go  a  long  way  in\r\n\r\nupholding  the  independence and integrity of  our  political\r\n\r\nprocess.   I  have  made such a long speech to  explain  this\r\n\r\nbecause  I think it is necessary for Members to have a  clear\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money and politics seem to be frequently linked\r\n\r\ntogether.  It  has troubled the politics of  many  countries.\r\n\r\nRecently,  we read in the newspapers that the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nof  a certain country wept openly because his political party\r\n\r\nwas  baffled  by money politics.  In the recent  presidential\r\n\r\nelection  in  Taiwan, we also saw the \"black  gold\"  politics\r\n\r\nprevailing over Taiwan.  According to newspaper reports, some\r\n\r\npeople  in the United States alleged that China had attempted\r\n\r\nto  make  political  donations to the Democratic  Party,  and\r\n\r\ncreated a huge hue and cry out of that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us come back to politics in Singapore. I think\r\n\r\nwe  are fortunate because we do not have such problems.   The\r\n\r\nreason is that the PAP Government has consistently maintained\r\n\r\nits  stand  on  keeping politics clean and transparent  here.\r\n\r\nAll  these  years,  the  Government is  against  and  resists\r\n\r\nforeign  interference in our domestic affairs, including  the\r\n\r\ninfluence  through financial means.  Now that  we  have  this\r\n\r\nBill  before  us,  we should be able to further  enhance  and\r\n\r\ninstitutionalise   clean   government,   to   safeguard   the\r\n\r\nsovereignty and integrity of our country, and to promote  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of transparent politics.  Therefore, I think this\r\n\r\nBill is in keeping with our national interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, does this Bill disadvantage the\r\n\r\nopposition  parties?  I do not think so.  Everyone  is  equal\r\n\r\nbefore  the law, the opposition parties and the ruling  party\r\n\r\nalike.  Every party must come under the law, and so this Bill\r\n\r\nwill  not  hamper the development of any opposition party  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a clean political system, whether a candidate wins\r\n\r\nor  loses an election is dependent on whether or not he  gets\r\n\r\nthe  support of his electorate.  I think the key does not lie\r\n\r\nin  whether  this candidate or his political  party  has  the\r\n\r\nmoney, or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether  the party has political donations.  The key lies  in\r\n\r\nwhether this candidate or the party has the platform that  is\r\n\r\nin  the  interest of the country and the people, and  can  be\r\n\r\nidentified  by  the  people.   The  financial  power  of  the\r\n\r\ncandidate and his party is irrelevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is whether this Bill will affect the\r\n\r\ncivic organisations or civil society.  I do not think so.  On\r\n\r\nthe  contrary,  I  feel that this Bill will  encourage  civic\r\n\r\norganisations to develop and prosper. This is because we  are\r\n\r\nnow encouraging active citizenship, encouraging our people to\r\n\r\ntake part in our public affairs, to show their concern in the\r\n\r\nsociety and  the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you have a civic organisation whose objective and\r\n\r\nmotivation is very clear,  transparent and proper,  then  why\r\n\r\nshould they fear?  Why should they worry at all, unless  they\r\n\r\nhave   ulterior   motive,  and  they   have   to   act   very\r\n\r\nsurreptitiously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether this Bill will deter people from donating\r\n\r\nmoney  to political parties, I do not think so.  Ours  is  an\r\n\r\nopen  and transparent political system.  Unless a person  has\r\n\r\nsome  ulterior  motive,  unless  this  person  has  incorrect\r\n\r\nobjective,   he has  nothing to fear or worry  at  all.   Why\r\n\r\nshould  he  worry about donating money to support  a  certain\r\n\r\ncandidate or a certain political party?  He can donate  money\r\n\r\nto  a party or a candidate that he believes can represent his\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill cannot give us 100%\r\n\r\nprotection or safeguard.  In other words, it cannot fully and\r\n\r\ncompletely  deter certain people, particularly  those  people\r\n\r\nwith  ulterior motives, to work through loopholes to try  and\r\n\r\ninfluence  the political process in Singapore.  But  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  overall,  with our strong political structure,  we  can\r\n\r\nmaintain  clean, open and transparent politics.   Ultimately,\r\n\r\nit  will depend on those who take part in politics themselves\r\n\r\n-  whether such people have the moral conduct.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  even with this Bill around, it can only  give  us\r\n\r\ncertain protection and safeguard.  But we must still continue\r\n\r\nto insist that all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose  who take part in politics must have the integrity  and\r\n\r\ngood   moral  conduct,  so  as  to  continue  upholding   our\r\n\r\ntransparent, clean and open political tradition in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThat Singapore has this clean, transparent and open political\r\n\r\ntradition  is, to a large extent, attributed to our political\r\n\r\nleaders who themselves maintain very noble moral standards in\r\n\r\npolitics and they have established the good example  for  all\r\n\r\nto  emulate. Therefore, even though we now have this Bill, we\r\n\r\nmust continue to defend and uphold this tradition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is nothing new, as most countries prohibit\r\n\r\nexternal  political donations.  Although it  is  not  in  our\r\n\r\npolitical  culture to allow external influence  to  undermine\r\n\r\nour  political system, it is timely to legislate this in case\r\n\r\nsome  political  parties are tempted  to  become  puppets  of\r\n\r\noutside   agency.   Singapore  is  a  very   small   country,\r\n\r\nstrategically located both geographically and politically  in\r\n\r\nthis  region, and therefore we always play a significant role\r\n\r\nin  the  global political arena, and may be courted by  other\r\n\r\ncountries  for their own political agenda.  We must therefore\r\n\r\nensure  that  our independent stand on international  affairs\r\n\r\nshould  never be compromised and come under any influence  by\r\n\r\nother  nations,  big or small.  Because of our  openness,  we\r\n\r\nmust  ensure  that  Government must not be subjected  to  any\r\n\r\noutside  political pressure to influence the  way  we  govern\r\n\r\nourselves.   We must maintain our national integrity  at  all\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donation of any kind from foreign sources invariably\r\n\r\nmeans influence of our politicians involved as those who  pay\r\n\r\nout  of funds must have their own ulterior motive and agenda.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is necessary that we introduce  the  Bill  to\r\n\r\nensure that our political parties and candidates taking  part\r\n\r\nin  any of our parliamentary or presidential elections uphold\r\n\r\ntheir  independence  and  not be  subjected  to  any  outside\r\n\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Opposition Members, Mr Chiam See Tong\r\n\r\nand Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nKhiang, have come out in support of the Bill, as was reported\r\n\r\nin the press.  However, when they raised objection to some of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions to safeguard the administration of the  Bill,\r\n\r\nthey  betrayed their sincerity in their support for the Bill.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of having a legislation with no safeguard for\r\n\r\nits   implementation,  if  the  legislation  is   so   easily\r\n\r\ncircumvented, and if one can find so many ways to get  around\r\n\r\nthe  rules  and  regulations governing the Act?   Surely  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the Bill becomes meaningless.   In  fact,  on\r\n\r\nThursday,  18th May, the Straits Times reported that  in  the\r\n\r\nUS,  a  member  of  the Federal Election Commission  lamented\r\n\r\nthat,  \"The  Federal  Election law is in serious  gravity  of\r\n\r\nlosing  all  effectiveness.\"  The aim of the law  enacted  25\r\n\r\nyears  ago  has  eroded over time because despite  the  tight\r\n\r\nrules  and  regulations in place, the US  Election  is  being\r\n\r\ninfluenced by people who found ways to exploit the  loopholes\r\n\r\nto  achieve their personal objectives.  Therefore,  far  from\r\n\r\nbeing too stringent in the provision of all safeguards in the\r\n\r\nBill,  such  as those laid out in clauses 8, 12,  13  and  14\r\n\r\nwhich  maintain that the candidates or political  parties  be\r\n\r\ntransparent   in  receiving  any  donation  from  permissible\r\n\r\nsources and state their conditions in which political parties\r\n\r\ncan accept political donations, in actuality, it would not be\r\n\r\nsufficient to cover all the loopholes which can be  exploited\r\n\r\nby  those  intending  to  exert influence  on  our  political\r\n\r\nparties  or  candidates and for those in the  same  party  or\r\n\r\ncandidates who want to act as proxy for some outside agency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, in the Forum page, a group of readers is\r\n\r\nconcerned that the definition of political association in the\r\n\r\nAct  would  affect adversely the group of civil societies  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I am puzzled because civil societies are supposed\r\n\r\nto  be  non-partisan and they are supposed  to  be  concerned\r\n\r\ncitizens who speak up for Singaporeans on matters relating to\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy governing Singapore.  They should  not  be\r\n\r\nsupporting  any political party or candidates and  definitely\r\n\r\nhave no reason to receive donations from foreign sources  for\r\n\r\nthese purposes.  Therefore, to call for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe re-definition of political association to mean two-thirds\r\n\r\nof  an  organisation's  annual funding and  activities  being\r\n\r\nspent  on supporting the election of political candidates  is\r\n\r\nmeaningless.  Associations or societies are either  political\r\n\r\nor non-political.  It cannot be two-thirds political and one-third  non-political.  It is absurd to see how an association\r\n\r\nor  society  which is committed to a cause can be  so  wishy-washy and be so indecisive as to which role they are to play.\r\n\r\nBesides,  if the term is being re-defined, what  is  to  stop\r\n\r\npolitical  parties  from  establishing  civil  societies   or\r\n\r\nassociations  as  a fund to channel foreign funds  for  their\r\n\r\npolitical  use?  It is precisely this and I feel  that  there\r\n\r\nare  still  many ways in which one can circumvent  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nOffhand, I can think of two.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what if a political candidate writes a book,\r\n\r\nnever  mind  the  substance of the contents, and  an  outside\r\n\r\nagency  buys up 1,000 copies at an inflated price to generate\r\n\r\nthe  necessary funds intended to be given to the party or the\r\n\r\ncandidate?  Secondly, a political candidate can be invited to\r\n\r\ngive  a  lecture  in  another country and  be  given  a  huge\r\n\r\nhonorarium  which is not commensurate with the  substance  of\r\n\r\nthe  lecture, but purely as a means to justify the  donation.\r\n\r\nThis  is  definitely not acceptable.  If the candidate  is  a\r\n\r\nrespectable  statesman or someone who is being held  in  high\r\n\r\nesteem  by  the international community, then the  honorarium\r\n\r\ncan be justified.  But if some unknown political aspirant  is\r\n\r\ngiven  a  huge  sum of honorarium for such  a  lecture,  then\r\n\r\nobviously  something  is  very wrong.   These  are  just  two\r\n\r\nexamples which can be used by unscrupulous foreign sources to\r\n\r\ngenerate  funds  for the political party and  candidate  they\r\n\r\nintend to assert influence, and I am sure there are many more\r\n\r\nif we do not comprehensively tighten all the loopholes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to consider ways to tighten\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  by introducing a clause where the onus is  on  the\r\n\r\npolitical party or candidate to prove that any funds received\r\n\r\nby  any means should be bona fide and not as a cover for such\r\n\r\nfunds to be generated for political use from outside\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsources.   It  is  also necessary to monitor  other  channels\r\n\r\nwhere the funds can be made that have not been covered by the\r\n\r\nBill.   The Registrar of Political Donations should be  given\r\n\r\nmore  power  to  investigate funds which he  is  not  totally\r\n\r\nsatisfied that they are being donated in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nPolitical Donations Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This Bill particularly concerns  the\r\n\r\nopposition  parties and it is very vital for  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties.  I thank you for recognising that and you have given\r\n\r\nme the opportunity to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us make no mistake about this Bill. This Bill\r\n\r\nis  going  to have far-reaching implications on the political\r\n\r\ndevelopment in this country.  Let no one misunderstand  that.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill, I say, is sounding the death knell for  political\r\n\r\ndevelopment  along  the road to a greater democracy  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  That is what it is all about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard this afternoon from the Minister but what\r\n\r\nhe  has said does not, even in one iota, tell us the need for\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of this Bill in Singapore and  particularly\r\n\r\nat this point of time.  It is completely silent on that.  May\r\n\r\nI tell the Government that questions have been raised outside\r\n\r\nand  I  have spoken to others and they say, \"Why do you think\r\n\r\nthe  Government is introducing this Bill now?\"  They need  to\r\n\r\nbe  answered.  So I ask the Minister, when he replies, to try\r\n\r\nand  answer that question.  What is the burning necessity for\r\n\r\nthis Bill to be introduced in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  at this particular moment? And furthermore,  there\r\n\r\nare a number of other things wrong about the way this Bill is\r\n\r\nbeing  presented in Parliament.  It was read  for  the  first\r\n\r\ntime on the 9th of this month.  Barely 12 days after that, we\r\n\r\nare  asked  to  pass  this Bill. What  is  the  great  haste?\r\n\r\nBecause  this  Bill concerns Singaporeans, it is  a  question\r\n\r\nthat   concerns   Singaporeans,  the  growth   of   political\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  this  country. Every Singaporean  should  be\r\n\r\ninterested  in  that.  Where are we heading  in  the  way  of\r\n\r\npolitical  development?  Why is the Government  rushing  this\r\n\r\nBill  through?  There  have been no opportunities  given  for\r\n\r\ndiscussion on this Bill outside Parliament.  There  has  been\r\n\r\nno  opportunity given by way of a White Paper explaining  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for  this Bill.  It will be passed as though  it  is\r\n\r\njust  an ordinary Bill, and people should not worry too  much\r\n\r\nabout it. This is no ordinary Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to oppose this Bill, not only myself but\r\n\r\nalso  my  Party.   The  previous speaker mentioned  that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hougang from my Party supported the Bill. I  have\r\n\r\nclarified this with the Member.  It would appear that he  was\r\n\r\nquoted  out  of  context.  Of course, the Workers'  Party  is\r\n\r\nsecond to none in not wanting foreigners to come and tell  us\r\n\r\nhow to run our country.  But what does this Bill do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, for all its high-sounding words from the\r\n\r\nMinister,  is attempting to dry up for the political  parties\r\n\r\nin Singapore getting monies to further the cause of democracy\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore.  The People's Action Party, I am quite  sure,\r\n\r\nis  flushed with funds.  We have not been told how much  they\r\n\r\nhave  got in the kitty.  Would they like to tell us?  We will\r\n\r\nthen  tell you how much the Workers' Party has, but I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  Government knows what the Workers' Party has.  I do  not\r\n\r\nspeak  for  the other opposition parties but I am  sure  that\r\n\r\nthey  do not have anything like what the PAP can boast of  in\r\n\r\nthe  way  of funds.  May I ask:  is that a healthy  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs for Singapore that whilst the Government ruling party\r\n\r\nis  able  to  tap  money, the other political  parties  which\r\n\r\noppose the Government are starved of any funds?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that the PAP Treasurer, in a statement to the\r\n\r\npapers some days ago, mentioned that quite a substantial  sum\r\n\r\ncomes from the members themselves and he picks up the monthly\r\n\r\npledges  or  donations made by the Ministers. Of course,  the\r\n\r\nMinisters can afford to give out of their huge salaries  that\r\n\r\nthey  are being paid from public monies.  May I ask: is  that\r\n\r\none  of the reasons why Ministers are paid such huge sums  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  Party may get some of the money?  But he  makes  a\r\n\r\nvalid  point, and that is this. This is the Treasurer of  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party, and he says this  Bill  may  prevent\r\n\r\npeople  who have given donations anonymously in the  past  to\r\n\r\nthink  whether  they  should continue to give  any  donations\r\n\r\nanonymously.  There you have it.  This is to try and cut  off\r\n\r\nfrom  the  other political parties people who would  like  to\r\n\r\ngive  money to the political parties but who wish  to  remain\r\n\r\nanonymous.  They  will not.  Of course, they  will  be  quite\r\n\r\nhappy to give donations to the People's Action Party and even\r\n\r\nhave  their names recorded so that the Party knows that  they\r\n\r\nare good Singaporeans who support the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister: is there any evidence? Let us be\r\n\r\nserious   about  this  Bill.  Is  there  any  evidence   that\r\n\r\nopposition   parties   have  received  funds   from   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore?   Have  you  got any evidence?   Let  us  have  it\r\n\r\ninstead  of  making glib statements that  we  must  tell  our\r\n\r\npolitical parties not to be funded from outside. Let us  have\r\n\r\nit  here  and now.  Is there any evidence, other than foreign\r\n\r\ninterests,  that  vested  interests in  Singapore  are  using\r\n\r\nopposition political parties for their own ends?  Let me tell\r\n\r\nthe  House that no company in Singapore will want to make any\r\n\r\ndonation  to an opposition party.  That is the grim state  of\r\n\r\naffairs in Singapore. While they will be ready to open  their\r\n\r\npurses  for the PAP, they will not make any donation  to  the\r\n\r\nopposition.  What are the opposition parties to do? They will\r\n\r\nbe crippled. This is an attempt to further cripple them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister refers to other countries but there has\r\n\r\nbeen  public  disquiet about huge funds  going  to  political\r\n\r\nparties by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  trying to influence policies and decisions.  We  know\r\n\r\nall  that.   Do we have that in Singapore?  There is  a  Bill\r\n\r\nbefore  the  UK Parliament. I have tried to get hold  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  but  I was not able to get the whole Bill, but  I  have\r\n\r\nseen  a  little bit of it.  There, it was because of disquiet\r\n\r\namong  the public over huge sums of money being paid.   Quite\r\n\r\nhonestly, let us have it.  What is the motive and purpose for\r\n\r\nthis Bill at this present moment in Singapore? I shall have a\r\n\r\nlot  to  say more, Sir, on the lack of any public discussion,\r\n\r\nbut  time is running on and I want to try and explain  why  I\r\n\r\nthink this Bill has been introduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister refers to past instances and I see he has\r\n\r\nbrought  in  the  Chew Swee Kee episode.  That  was  the  sum\r\n\r\nreceived  by  the Government in power, not by  an  opposition\r\n\r\npolitical  party.  I know all about that because I took  part\r\n\r\nin  that  inquiry before Justice Buttrose.  How  is  that  an\r\n\r\ninstance of the need for this Bill at this particular  stage?\r\n\r\nThen  he brings in Mr Francis Seow.  Was there any suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  he  received any monies?  Did the PAP have any evidence\r\n\r\nthat  the  US Embassy was giving him large sums of money?   I\r\n\r\nask the Minister to explain in this House whether this is not\r\n\r\nanother instance of the PAP Government crying wolf to further\r\n\r\nstrangle  opposition parties?  This is not mere rhetoric,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir.  This Government has a history of crying  wolf\r\n\r\nwhenever  it wants to introduce legislation or take decisions\r\n\r\nwhich they think the people may not be ready to accept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to instance four such cases. In 1972, at an\r\n\r\nelection   rally,  a  PAP  candidate  seeking   election   to\r\n\r\nParliament  uttered a monstrous lie that the  Workers'  Party\r\n\r\nhad  received $600,000 from Malaysia.  $600,000  -  my  foot!\r\n\r\nWe  took  him to court for uttering this monstrous  lie,  but\r\n\r\nthis  was  all  part  of the PAP's plan then.   Because  even\r\n\r\nbefore  the  elections, there was publicity about  opposition\r\n\r\nparties,  particularly directed against the  Workers'  Party,\r\n\r\nwhich  I had joined in 1971, of being used by foreign  agents\r\n\r\nand   foreign  powers.   He  did  not  seek  to  justify  his\r\n\r\nstatement.  There was no truth in that statement. But we lost\r\n\r\nour case because\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Judge, the late Mr Justice F A Chua, dismissed the action\r\n\r\non  a  purely  technical reason that we had not  pleaded  the\r\n\r\nHokkien  text,  or  was it some other dialect  text,  in  our\r\n\r\nstatement of claim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, showing greater concern, the Constitution was\r\n\r\namended  to ensure that the sovereignty of Singapore was  not\r\n\r\nsurrendered, except only upon a referendum.  This is to  keep\r\n\r\nup  the  pretence,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that opposition  parties\r\n\r\nwill be ready to surrender Singapore's sovereignty to foreign\r\n\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, next in line, is the amendment to the Newspapers\r\n\r\nand  Printing  Presses  Act which  came  in  1974.   I  stand\r\n\r\ncorrected.   And I spoke on this Bill when I moved  a  motion\r\n\r\nfor  the  setting up of an independent newspaper in Singapore\r\n\r\nsometime last year.  There, the reason for that Bill was that\r\n\r\nforeigners were using the newspapers to influence politics in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I mentioned of speeches in this House by  Members\r\n\r\n-   there was no Opposition Member in Parliament at that time\r\n\r\n-   saying,  \"We  can't allow foreign devils, foreigners,  to\r\n\r\ntake over our newspapers.  We've got to stop all this.\"  They\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"There  was also evidence that foreign embassies  were\r\n\r\nusing  the newspapers with their advertisements.\"   All  well\r\n\r\nand good, outwardly.  But what was the real purpose?  Speaker\r\n\r\nafter  speaker spoke of the need for Singaporeans to  control\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers.  Yes, but what was the result of that  Bill,\r\n\r\nas I said last year?  The result was to pass over total iron-fisted  control  over  the  press  to  the  Government.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  to be consulted through its two  classes  of\r\n\r\nshareholders  -  the ordinary and preferred shareholders, who\r\n\r\nhad to be appointed by the Government.  And every appointment\r\n\r\nof  any  staff had to be made by these preferred shareholders\r\n\r\nappointed  by  the Minister.  So, what was  previously  a  de\r\n\r\nfacto  control of the press became legal with the passing  of\r\n\r\nthe  1974  Bill.   The Government could  then  point  to  the\r\n\r\nsection and say, \"There you are, we've got the section  here.\r\n\r\nYou  can't appoint so-and-so as editor.  You've got  to  have\r\n\r\nthe  permission of all the preferred shareholders.\"  So, that\r\n\r\nis another instance of crying wolf that there was a great\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndanger to Singapore that newspapers were being taken over  by\r\n\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then came the arrests in 1987. This was not a Bill.\r\n\r\nThis was an Executive decision to arrest 22 persons.  Some of\r\n\r\nthem were accused of being proxies for foreign agents to take\r\n\r\nover  the  Workers'  Party.  One can see that  all  this  was\r\n\r\ndirected  at the Workers' Party.  The Government  was  saying\r\n\r\nthat these people were going to take over the Workers' Party,\r\n\r\nand  so,  as I said then, a fanciful case was built up,  that\r\n\r\nMarxists were taking over the Workers' Party.  They had to be\r\n\r\nstopped.  The Workers' Party had to be saved.  Well, it was a\r\n\r\nlot  of  nonsense.  And why?  The PAP saw that  the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  was becoming  a real threat.  After the 1981 election,\r\n\r\nthe PAP vote dropped 121/2%.  This is not fiction.   This  is\r\n\r\na  fact.   Never  before  had the PAP vote  dropped  to  that\r\n\r\nextent.  So, the writing was on the wall for the PAP.  And so\r\n\r\nthe  Workers'  Party had to be branded and some  of  us  were\r\n\r\nprosecuted  and  I  had to leave Parliament,  purely  out  of\r\n\r\nconvictions which the Privy Council said were wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there was an amendment to the Constitution to bring\r\n\r\nin  an  Executive  President.   Again,  the  reason  and  the\r\n\r\nrationale  that was put out for public consumption  was  that\r\n\r\nthe  opposition parties, if they were allowed to continue and\r\n\r\ntake over the Government, would squander our reserves.  So we\r\n\r\nhave  got  to  somehow put a brake on  that.   There  was  no\r\n\r\nquestion  about the PAP safeguarding its reserves.   The  PAP\r\n\r\nwill  safeguard the reserves.  It was the opposition  parties\r\n\r\nthat  would  squander  and so we had an Executive  President.\r\n\r\nBut now, as it turned out, after all that show, the President\r\n\r\nwas  not given the powers.  Things continued in much the same\r\n\r\nway,  but  the PAP was crying wolf to try and bring  in  that\r\n\r\ndramatic change in the way this country is run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would ask the Minister, when he replies, to try\r\n\r\nand  direct his mind to my question and not tell us about the\r\n\r\n1959 donation received by a Government Minister, not tell  us\r\n\r\nabout Mr Francis Seow, because they are all completely\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nirrelevant.   They are things of the past.  We want  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  there  is a need now.  Why are you introducing  this\r\n\r\nBill  now?  What is the danger to Singapore now?  It is  like\r\n\r\nwhenever  I  ask any question about the defence  expenditure,\r\n\r\nthey say,  \"Oh, we've got to be ready to meet threats.\"  When\r\n\r\nI  ask where is the threat coming from, they say, \"Oh, no, we\r\n\r\ncan't answer that question.\"  It is all in the mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister please be specific about the need for\r\n\r\nthis Bill at this point of time?  Or is it merely an attempt,\r\n\r\nseeing  that  elections may have to be held within  the  next\r\n\r\nyear  or so, to further strangle the opposition parties  from\r\n\r\nputting up a proper fight at the next elections?  The history\r\n\r\nof  this  Government has been one long series of attempts  to\r\n\r\ncripple, obstruct, opposition parties making headway.  Are we\r\n\r\nnot  interested in greater democracy in this  country?   Will\r\n\r\nyou  tell us now?  Is it the intention of the Government that\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  continue  as  it  has  with  the  PAP   in\r\n\r\ngovernment,  decreeing  what has  to  be  done  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwithout the people's participation?  People need to know  all\r\n\r\nthis.   Are  you  for  or are you against greater  democratic\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  Singapore?  Are you for or are  you  against\r\n\r\ngreater  participation by the people in  political  decision?\r\n\r\nThe Minister concentrates on foreign donations.  But what  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  realise, or he perhaps tries to hide, is  that  it\r\n\r\ndries up our own people here through the fear that exists  in\r\n\r\ntheir minds.

I wish to say that\r\n\r\nthe  Straits Times has not misquoted me.  I have indeed  told\r\n\r\nthe  Straits  Times  that  I am of the  view  that  political\r\n\r\nparties and politicians aspiring for public office should not\r\n\r\naccept donations or funding from foreign sources.  I stand by\r\n\r\nwhat  I  said.   But holding that view does not automatically\r\n\r\nput  me in a position that I would accept or support the view\r\n\r\nas  presented  in Parliament.  I suppose the  problem  arises\r\n\r\nbecause a Member might have misquoted the Straits Times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, there are three\r\n\r\nobjectives  of  this  Political  Donations  Bill.    Firstly,\r\n\r\nlegislating  to  require  supporters  donating  to  political\r\n\r\nparties  to  furnish  their names,  residential  address  and\r\n\r\nidentity  card numbers, so as to clip the financial resources\r\n\r\nof the political parties, thereby diminishing the development\r\n\r\ncapacity of the opposition parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to provide the PAP Government with better\r\n\r\naccess  to  information  on  the  financial  sources  of  the\r\n\r\nopposition parties and background of the supporters so as  to\r\n\r\nhit at the opposition parties whenever necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to avoid the event of the pseudo-phenomenon of\r\n\r\nthe so-called opening up under \"Singapore 21\" unintentionally\r\n\r\nresulting  in   civic organisations turning  to  support  the\r\n\r\nopposition parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, when a political party involves itself\r\n\r\nin  political  activities, it needs to have a lot  of  funds,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the situation of Singapore, where it is  said\r\n\r\nthat  \"no  money,  no talk\".  For example, if  an  opposition\r\n\r\nparty  wants to hold a forum or a mass rally, it needs  money\r\n\r\nto  pay  for the rent of the stadium and the various  venues,\r\n\r\nand  the  printing of publicity materials.  But the PAP  does\r\n\r\nnot need to incur these expenses because they can make use of\r\n\r\nthe  CCs,  RCs and other Government machinery to  spread  the\r\n\r\nnews.  They can even make use of the Feedback Unit to collect\r\n\r\ninformation and convey the PAP's philosophy and policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On operating expenses of a political party, we can see\r\n\r\nthat the party headquarter's rental itself will exceed $5,000\r\n\r\na  year.  The PAP has a team of highly paid Ministers who can\r\n\r\ndonate  to the Party and there are many, many more  MPs  than\r\n\r\nthe  opposition parties. Getting  huge sums in  donations  to\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  is  no  problem  at all.  But  for  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties,  they  do  not  have  such  substantial  and  stable\r\n\r\ndonations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition parties depend on donations of the\r\n\r\nordinary  citizens and proceeds from sale of party newspapers\r\n\r\nand petty donations from the people, ranging from 50 cents to\r\n\r\nless   than  a  hundred  dollars.   When  accumulated,  these\r\n\r\ndonations can add up to more than $5,000 in a year.  The Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  that in the event of  anonymous donations amounting\r\n\r\nto  more than $5,000 in a year, the Government can confiscate\r\n\r\nthem.   This  amounts  to  saying that  for  even  a  50-cent\r\n\r\ndonation, we need to record  the identity card number of  the\r\n\r\ndonor  to  show  that the donation comes from  a  permissible\r\n\r\ndonor;  otherwise  the donation will be confiscated.  In  the\r\n\r\npast, no receipt was issued for this type of donations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another type of donation comes from anonymous supporters\r\n\r\nwho are willing  to financially support opposition parties or\r\n\r\nthe  individual  candidates.  But  in  view  of  the  present\r\n\r\npolitical  environment in Singapore, they do not wish  to  be\r\n\r\nplaced  on  record  that  they  have  been  donating  to  the\r\n\r\nopposition  parties.  So even if we issue  official  receipts\r\n\r\nto  them,  they would normally request that we put  it  under\r\n\r\n\"anonymous\".   With the passage of this Bill, the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties  would  not  be able to accept their  donations,  and\r\n\r\ntheir financial strength will thus be diminished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, with the emergence of the Internet,\r\n\r\nthe  opposition parties now have more effective means to post\r\n\r\ntheir  bank  account number on the website so that  donations\r\n\r\ncan  be  deposited into their bank accounts directly, without\r\n\r\nworry.   But with the passage of this Bill, if the donors  do\r\n\r\nnot provide their personal particulars, they become anonymous\r\n\r\ndonors.  Eventually the donations will be confiscated by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  Even with the donors' particulars provided,\r\n\r\nthe responsible officers of the opposition parties are unable\r\n\r\nto  ascertain whether the donors are permissible donors.   If\r\n\r\nthey  choose  to accept these donations, they  face  possible\r\n\r\nprosecution  in court.  So this Bill has attained  its  first\r\n\r\nobjective  of  clipping  the  opposition  parties'  financial\r\n\r\nresources, thereby causing the opposition parties to be short\r\n\r\nof financial resources needed for their development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, let me talk about the second objective of this\r\n\r\nBill.   The  Bill requires that the political parties  submit\r\n\r\nannual  donation reports to the Registrar, giving details  of\r\n\r\nthe  donors'  names, addresses and IC numbers, and  also  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   can   require  the  parties  to   submit   other\r\n\r\ninformation,  at  any  time.  We do not  know  what  sort  of\r\n\r\ninformation they want in respect of each donor, and how  this\r\n\r\ninformation may be used.  I think only the PAP will know.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most absurd provision is that any person who donates\r\n\r\nmore  than  $10,000  in  a year to a  political  party  or  a\r\n\r\npolitical association is required to submit a donation report\r\n\r\nto  the  Registrar; failing which he can be charged in  court\r\n\r\nunder this law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the PAP Government introduces such a Bill, it\r\n\r\nis  invading  the  rights to free donations of  the  ordinary\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore.   In future, they  will  not  dare  to\r\n\r\ndonate,  because  once they donate money  to  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties,  they  are  inviting trouble for  themselves.   This\r\n\r\nPolitical   Donations  Bill  covers  also   other   political\r\n\r\nassociations.   The  Minister can, at any time,  gazette  any\r\n\r\norganisation as a political association to be covered by this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government has been talking about opening up a\r\n\r\ncivil  society. There are a lot of intellectuals in Singapore\r\n\r\nwho  are  actively contemplating  participation in our  local\r\n\r\npolitics.  The introduction of this Bill is a heavy  blow  to\r\n\r\nthem. The message the PAP Government  wants to convey is very\r\n\r\nclear,  that  is to say, if any so-called civic  organisation\r\n\r\nwants to criticise the Government or even to challenge the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment,  then  it  will be simply  categorised  as  being\r\n\r\nsimilar to an opposition party and it will be nipped  in  the\r\n\r\nbud  and  given no room to develop, just  like the opposition\r\n\r\nparties. They cannot criticise the Government's policies,  as\r\n\r\nan  independent organisation, because if an independent civic\r\n\r\norganisation  is  to  criticise the Government,  it  is  like\r\n\r\nenhancing the strength of the political party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that \"money can do wonders\". Indeed, money\r\n\r\nhas great magical power.  If a politician is overly dependent\r\n\r\non  huge donations from a certain source, his political sense\r\n\r\nmay  well be manoeuvred by this benefactor of his.  I believe\r\n\r\nthat any politician or political party should not accept  any\r\n\r\ndonation  from  foreign sources, otherwise it  would  subject\r\n\r\nitself to manoeuvering by the foreign power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under these major premises, the Political\r\n\r\nDonations  Bill has caused anxiety to ordinary  citizens  who\r\n\r\nwish  to donate to opposition parties and indirectly blocking\r\n\r\nthe donations to the opposition parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must clearly state that I oppose this Bill unless this\r\n\r\nBill  is  further discussed by a Select Committee.   So  from\r\n\r\nthis Bill, we can see very clearly that the PAP Government is\r\n\r\nmaking  use  of the human weakness to maintain its  one-party\r\n\r\nsuperiority.  At elections, it uses the threat tactics on the\r\n\r\npeople  and then they make use of this superpower  under  the\r\n\r\nISA to detain people without trial.  Now, with this Political\r\n\r\nDonations Bill, it is casting a shadow on those who aspire to\r\n\r\nparticipate in politics and creating a psychological fear  in\r\n\r\nthem.   So  anyone who wants to support the opposition  party\r\n\r\nwill  have  to openly reveal his identity, failing  which  he\r\n\r\nwill automatically lose his political rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all those who want to support the opposition to\r\n\r\nstand  up  courageously  and fight for  their  due  citizens'\r\n\r\npolitical rights. Do not cause a psychological barrier to  be\r\n\r\ngenerated  just  because  your identities  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nrevealed when making donations to the opposition parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting  from\r\n\r\nthe provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POLITICAL DONATIONS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I give my full support to the provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill  that  seek specifically to ban political  parties  from\r\n\r\nreceiving  contribution  or donation  from  foreign  sources.\r\n\r\nSome  in Singapore may feel that the Government may be crying\r\n\r\nwolf  because  we  have not experienced recent  incidents  of\r\n\r\nforeign  sources  attempting  to  influence  the  outcome  of\r\n\r\npolitical  elections in Singapore.  But  I  personally  think\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  be extremely careful and  vigilant  because\r\n\r\nexperiences  in  many countries have shown  that  once  money\r\n\r\npolitics take root in a political system, it would almost  be\r\n\r\nimpossible to eradicate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have laws limiting the amount of money candidates\r\n\r\nseeking parliamentary or presidential office can spend during\r\n\r\nelections.   This  is a good thing.  Our  present  system  of\r\n\r\ncapping political spending has been effective and has made it\r\n\r\npossible   for  independent  candidates  not  affiliated   to\r\n\r\nestablished political parties to seek political office.  This\r\n\r\nis  due  mainly  to  the  absence of  financial  barriers  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  elections.   This  is  one  aspect  of   our\r\n\r\npolitical system that must be preserved.  Experiences in many\r\n\r\nother  countries have shown that informal financial  barriers\r\n\r\nof entry have corrupted the electoral process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support laws imposing stricter and more\r\n\r\ntransparent financial housekeeping rules as they will provide\r\n\r\nfor   more  accessible  means  to  scrutinise  the  financial\r\n\r\naccounts  of  political parties and support a more  objective\r\n\r\nassessment of any organisation in any investigation  process.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  this  Bill  to check and control  the  source  of\r\n\r\nincome of political\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparties  is  timely  and  appropriate.   Unlike  Mr   J.   B.\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam, I have no problems with any of the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill in so far as it applies to political parties, if  it\r\n\r\nis  about catching the wolf, although disguised in sheepskin.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Sir,  I  have  reservation and  concern  about  the\r\n\r\nimplication  this Bill would have on civil society.   I  fear\r\n\r\nthat  civil society may become the unfortunate victim of this\r\n\r\nBill.   Therefore, I would like to raise some of  the  issues\r\n\r\nand  give  feedback  received by me  from  members  of  civil\r\n\r\nsociety to the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to perhaps consider excluding\r\n\r\npolitical  association  from  the  provisions  of  this  Bill\r\n\r\nbecause  it will pose all kinds of problems to civil society,\r\n\r\nthe  majority of whom have neither the capacity nor objective\r\n\r\nto  influence  either  the electoral process  or  outcome  of\r\n\r\nelections, but will nevertheless be adversely affected by the\r\n\r\nBill.   Even  if we have good reasons to do so, I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   to  consider  amending  the  definition   of\r\n\r\n\"political  association\" as it is too broad.   Because  I  am\r\n\r\npersuaded  to  accept  the  fact  that  civil  societies  and\r\n\r\norganisations  can  become  disguised  fronts  of   political\r\n\r\nparties.   It would also appear to me that, for example,  the\r\n\r\nDemocratic   Socialist   Club  and  the   Political   Science\r\n\r\nAssociation  of  the  NUS  whose main  objective  is  not  to\r\n\r\ninfluence  party  politics, but to  provide  a  platform  for\r\n\r\nintellectual discussion among university students,  would  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  a  political association.  In this regard,  I  am\r\n\r\ncurious  to find out the Minister's definition and  how  this\r\n\r\nwill  apply to the PAP Community Foundation, whose activities\r\n\r\nare purely educational, but is part of the PAP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, personally, for me, how would the Minister regard\r\n\r\nthe  Roundtable  and  whether  it  would  be  gazetted  as  a\r\n\r\npolitical  organisation?   What I  attempt  to  show  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  is that we have three different groups  with  three\r\n\r\ndifferent types of activities, but, by sheer definition,  may\r\n\r\nall  be  subject to the provisions of this Bill.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nwhat  constitutes wholly or mainly politics in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nproblematic to interpret.  The discretionary powers given  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister, in my view,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmay  be  too  wide  and  will put the Minister  in  a  no-win\r\n\r\nsituation,  as it would be convenient for critics  to  accuse\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of  wanting  to have this  provision  possibly\r\n\r\nbecause its views are inconsistent with the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to offer some other suggestions which would\r\n\r\nperhaps  achieve  the  same  purpose  of  preventing  foreign\r\n\r\ninfluence  and, yet, perhaps remove some of the inconvenience\r\n\r\nthat may hamper the activities of non-partisan civic groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Organisations registered under the Societies Act and\r\n\r\nwhose  activities  relate to the politics  in  Singapore  can\r\n\r\nhave,  in  their  constitution,  provisions  disallowing  its\r\n\r\nmembers to become members of any political party or engage in\r\n\r\nany  partisan  politics,  failing  which  then  perhaps  such\r\n\r\norganisations  should be deemed to be political organisations\r\n\r\nunder this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We can have provisions where organisations can be\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  be  political organisations where,  for  example,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a large membership size although the objective  of\r\n\r\nthe  society is to be very broad based.  Or where there is  a\r\n\r\nlarge  amount  of  operating  expenditure,  we  can  draw   a\r\n\r\ndifference between an organisation with a $2,000 bank account\r\n\r\nand  one with $2 million in operating expenditure to fund its\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where such organisations have a significant portion\r\n\r\nof   their  income  deriving  from  foreign  sources,   quite\r\n\r\nlogically, they should be gazetted as political organisations\r\n\r\nand  subject  to this provision.  So I hope the Minister  can\r\n\r\naccept  these points, and that amendments and refinements  to\r\n\r\nthis Bill can be made so that we can achieve the major intent\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill without jeopardising the activities  of  civil\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other problematic implications which I\r\n\r\nwish  to  highlight and seek the clarification and  assurance\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For many of us in civil society, the Internet,\r\n\r\nglobalisation  and the maturing civic movement  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhave meant greater collaboration and cooperation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  civil societies in other parts of the world.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nmy  own  experience has shown how surprising  foreigners  are\r\n\r\nabout the growth of civil society in Singapore over the  last\r\n\r\nfew  years.  However, this growth will be affected because  a\r\n\r\nlarge  part  of the activities of civil society  are  through\r\n\r\nseminars and conferences overseas.  It is common for  foreign\r\n\r\norganisations  to contribute towards travel and accommodation\r\n\r\nexpenses when inviting Singapore participants.  But this Bill\r\n\r\nwill  deem these organisations as non-permissible donors  and\r\n\r\ntherefore disallow such contributions.  Conferences, seminars\r\n\r\nand  discussions  are  vital  lifeline  to  civil  societies.\r\n\r\nPresently,  many  civil societies have  difficulties  raising\r\n\r\nfunds locally to carry out such projects.  I have raised this\r\n\r\nmatter  at the last Budget debate and here I am repeating  my\r\n\r\nearlier  call for greater Government's support towards  civil\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, the Roundtable, for example, has carried out\r\n\r\nfund raising projects, for example, a childcare centre called\r\n\r\nHaripasad  in  Ang Mo Kio.  This is a good  thing  for  civil\r\n\r\nsociety  to be engaged in beyond discussion.  But I fear  the\r\n\r\nfuture  of  such  activities as donors  may  have  their  own\r\n\r\nreservations   and   interpretations   about   having   their\r\n\r\nidentities  recorded.  Many would err on the side of  caution\r\n\r\nand would be reluctant to support such organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The definition of \"permissible donors\". For a\r\n\r\ncompany, the definition of \"permissible donor\" is such that a\r\n\r\ndonor  has to be a Singapore-controlled company which carries\r\n\r\nout  its  business wholly or mainly in Singapore.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nit excludes Singapore-controlled companies but whose business\r\n\r\nactivities are wholly or mainly outside Singapore as they are\r\n\r\ntermed \"non-permissible donors\".  This Bill may appear to  be\r\n\r\nout of touch with the regionalisation realities of companies.\r\n\r\nMy  question  to  the Minister is: why can  we  not  separate\r\n\r\ncorporate  identity and registration from  the  geography  in\r\n\r\nwhich they do their business in?  The reality is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  there will be some Singapore-controlled companies which\r\n\r\nderive  most  of  their income from outside  Singapore.   Why\r\n\r\nshould  these  companies  be  excluded  or  discouraged  from\r\n\r\ncontributing  to civil societies in Singapore  when  what  we\r\n\r\nreally  need  is exactly the reverse, that they  continue  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the various social causes in Singapore so  that\r\n\r\nthey  remain  rooted to this country?  What  about  donations\r\n\r\nfrom  a  private trust and foundations which are also a  main\r\n\r\nsource  of  income to civil societies?  I wish  the  Minister\r\n\r\ncould clarify on this point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the meaning of \"donation\". Clause 3(2)(f)\r\n\r\nprohibits  the  collection of fees and subscription  paid  by\r\n\r\nforeigners to a political association.  My question  is:  why\r\n\r\ndo  you  have  an organisation, say, a think tank  formed  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss regional security issues and have members and experts\r\n\r\nfrom  around  the region?  This Bill will then  prohibit  the\r\n\r\norganisation from collecting fees and subscription from  such\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the value of donation. This Bill requires the\r\n\r\norganisation  to  value  all  donations  and  gifts  only  on\r\n\r\ncommercial  terms.  Again, this provision may be problematic.\r\n\r\nDepending  on  how you value some of these contributions,  it\r\n\r\nmay  exceed  the  amount  required  to  be  reported  to  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Political Donations which is $10,000,  and  an\r\n\r\nerror  may subject a person to prosecution and a fine  simply\r\n\r\nbecause   of  his  underestimation  of  the  value   of   the\r\n\r\ncontributions  given to the organisation.   This  will  cause\r\n\r\nsome  problems  for  civil  societies.   We  have  also  seen\r\n\r\nrecently  the  emergence  of the individuals  who  stand  for\r\n\r\nparliamentary  elections.  They get  help  from  friends  and\r\n\r\nfamilies who do so in their personal capacities, or maybe  as\r\n\r\nproprietors of their own firms.  The interpretation  of  this\r\n\r\nBill will make it problematic for friends and families to get\r\n\r\nhelp, except on purely commercial terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have given my qualified support for this Bill but\r\n\r\nwould  appeal  to  the  Minister  to  consider  some  of  the\r\n\r\namendments and suggestions that I have made.  I hope that the\r\n\r\nThird Reading of this Bill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  be  deferred to the next sitting so that some  of  these\r\n\r\ninputs  from civil societies can be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nSir, we have come so far, I think this is a good Bill and has\r\n\r\ngood  intentions.   But if we can make  some  amendments  and\r\n\r\nallow  civil societies' inputs to be considered, many of  the\r\n\r\nunnecessary  constraints imposed on civil  societies  can  be\r\n\r\navoided.   I  do  not think that it is such an urgent  matter\r\n\r\nthat we cannot wait for another month or so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nas all good Singaporeans, we want the destiny of this country\r\n\r\nto be decided by our own citizens and by Singaporeans, and in\r\n\r\nwanting  to exclude or have rules to prevent foreigners  from\r\n\r\ntrying  to  control and unduly influence the outcome  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety wins my support.  At the same time, while we  try  to\r\n\r\nhave  controls to prevent foreigners coming in, we must still\r\n\r\nencourage  the participation of our citizens in our political\r\n\r\nlife and civil society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy and democratic institutions can be\r\n\r\nstrengthened if more of our citizens participate and take  an\r\n\r\ninterest  in politics and civil society matters.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  challenge  here  is  to get the  right  balance  between\r\n\r\ncontrols  and free involvement.  We should not have too  much\r\n\r\ncontrols in that the free involvement becomes constrained.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  art is getting the right balance.  But before  we\r\n\r\neven  talk  about balance, when we talk about  the  need  for\r\n\r\nfunds, the biggest need for funds is actually to participate.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if  you make it cheap and not too  expensive  for\r\n\r\npeople  to  participate in politics and stand for  elections,\r\n\r\nthen  the  need to raise funds and be dependent on  too  many\r\n\r\nsources  of funds become unnecessary.  Therefore, having  the\r\n\r\nelections where you have limits on expenditure, ie, $2.50 per\r\n\r\nvoter, does not make it really necessary to raise funds.  And\r\n\r\nwe  should  still work at great expense to keep  expenses  of\r\n\r\nconducting  elections  and  being  involved  in  public  life\r\n\r\naffordable,  and  barriers for entry as low as  possible,  so\r\n\r\nthat any Singaporean who aspires to get into politics through\r\n\r\na party, or as an independent candidate, can freely do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, we also need a few clarifications.\r\n\r\nOne  of the clarifications is we need to define a little  bit\r\n\r\nmore  on  the  political associations  other  than  political\r\n\r\nparties.   And  one of the best ways is for the  Minister  to\r\n\r\ngive examples, and even if he has the examples and he has  to\r\n\r\ngazette,  it  is  good to give ample notice  to  a  concerned\r\n\r\norganisation.  And I would support that more than a political\r\n\r\nparty  should  be defined as \"political association\"  because\r\n\r\nmany could be third parties who can influence outcomes.   The\r\n\r\nUS  presidential election is a clear cut example where a  lot\r\n\r\nof  third-party  people  under great  or  strange  names  are\r\n\r\ninfluencing the outcome.  I do not think we should have  that\r\n\r\nin Singapore but we should at the same time be very clear who\r\n\r\nwe are referring to and how we want to do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other provision is in clause 3(2)(e) about\r\n\r\nsponsorship.  It is quite widely defined and we do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhat  exactly it means.  If somebody invites you for a dinner\r\n\r\nand  is  a political association, and you pay for the dinner,\r\n\r\nwould  it  be  considered sponsorship?  Or  if  they  have  a\r\n\r\npublication   and  people  advertise,  would   it   also   be\r\n\r\nsponsorship?   What about cost of seminars  and  conferences?\r\n\r\nWould  it  be  all right to sponsor research  programmes,  or\r\n\r\nsomebody's  political  organisation,  because  the   research\r\n\r\nprogrammes  could  have  impact on  the  positions  to  take?\r\n\r\nTherefore, this clause needs a bit more clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few suggestions. First, the limit on anonymous\r\n\r\ndonations.  I have looked at the British Bill.  In  UK,  they\r\n\r\nsay up to pound 50, it is anonymous.  You only declare if  it\r\n\r\nis more than pound 50.  It seems we have modelled quite a lot\r\n\r\non  the British Bill.  We can take a similar approach and say\r\n\r\nthat  if  it  is  less  than  S$100,  it  can  be  considered\r\n\r\nanonymous.  Because I do not think anybody with $5,000  would\r\n\r\ngo  and  ask  500  people to donate $100  each.   It  is  too\r\n\r\ntroublesome and it would not do.  The other point is only the\r\n\r\nbig  donors  will be the ones who can exert undue  influence.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to keep political societies and political  parties\r\n\r\nindependent, it is better\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  have  small donors but widespread and mass organisations,\r\n\r\nbecause  after  all  winning  election  is  by  getting  mass\r\n\r\nsupport.   And if they do not have ideas that can  induce  or\r\n\r\nencourage the ordinary men to contribute, then the idea dies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is about corporate donations.\r\n\r\nCorporations  cannot vote in an election.  It is individuals.\r\n\r\nThe country is made of individuals.  And I do not support the\r\n\r\nidea  of  companies  making  contributions  or  donations  to\r\n\r\npolitical  parties.   If  you want  to  have  rules,  let  us\r\n\r\ncompletely   prevent  companies  or  corporate  bodies   from\r\n\r\ndonating.   In the UK law, they ask for a general meeting  of\r\n\r\nmembers  to  decide to give or not to give.  But in  UK,  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  also  have  funds to contribute  to  political\r\n\r\nparties.   Societies do.  But in Singapore, our trade  unions\r\n\r\ndo  not.   Our Trade Unions Act prevents that and  there  are\r\n\r\ngood reasons for that.  Many of our societies do not do that.\r\n\r\nCooperative  societies  do not do  that,  and  we  have  good\r\n\r\nreasons  for  that.  And we should also not allow individuals\r\n\r\nto   support  political  parties  or  political  issues  with\r\n\r\ncorporate big business money.  We should not come to a  state\r\n\r\nlike  in  the United States where big businesses  have  undue\r\n\r\ninfluence  in our political process.  Therefore,  if  anybody\r\n\r\nwants to donate, let them donate as individuals and let  them\r\n\r\nbe  identified.  Let us be transparent about it  rather  than\r\n\r\nthrough the veil of a corporation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I also want to say that as long as we keep the\r\n\r\nother pieces of legislation on elections and allow free media\r\n\r\naccess for people to express their ideas, there will be  less\r\n\r\ndanger of us having to worry about the need to implement this\r\n\r\nBill.  In that sense, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I thank you for giving\r\n\r\nme  the  opportunity to speak on the Bill  which  I  rise  in\r\n\r\nsupport of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that in any country, public\r\n\r\nconfidence and the integrity of the political system must  be\r\n\r\nmaintained at all times.  Members of the public must have  no\r\n\r\nreason to believe that political parties, policies and indeed\r\n\r\nany politician have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeen  influenced  by  large  donors.   As  a  sovereign   and\r\n\r\nindependent country, with a Government that is democratically\r\n\r\nelected, the legitimacy of the Government would depend on the\r\n\r\ntrust that people have.  They must not doubt that the leaders\r\n\r\nin  power decide policies that work in the long-term interest\r\n\r\nof  the country. Where the perception exists that leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government or politicians take instructions from  people\r\n\r\nwho  donate  large sums of money, public trust in  Government\r\n\r\nwould  surely  be  undermined  and  with  it,  its  effective\r\n\r\ngovernance.   I  therefore welcome the  introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, while I support the Bill, as a matter\r\n\r\nof  general principle, there are a number of areas which  the\r\n\r\nBill will require clarification and further consideration.  I\r\n\r\nshall dwell on some of these.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Bill distinguishes between foreign and local\r\n\r\ndonations.   In  the  case  of  foreign  donation,  the  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  generally that every political association,  party,\r\n\r\nor candidate must not accept a donation if it is offered by a\r\n\r\nperson  who is not a permissible donor.  The Bill  defines  a\r\n\r\npermissible  donor, inter alia, as either  an  individual,  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean  who is at least 21 years of age or a  Singapore-controlled company which carries on business wholly or mainly\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  The  Bill  further  defines,  inter  alia,  a\r\n\r\nSingapore-controlled  company to mean a company  incorporated\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and the majority of whose directors and members\r\n\r\nare citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a direct donation by a foreigner is not possible,\r\n\r\nit  would be relatively quite easy for a foreigner who  seeks\r\n\r\nto  circumvent the restrictions of the Bill by channelling  a\r\n\r\ndonation through a permissible donor.  As I said earlier, the\r\n\r\ndefinition   of  a  Singapore-controlled  company   basically\r\n\r\ndefines the company as one that is incorporated in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhere  the majority of directors and members are citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It would be possible in certain situations  where\r\n\r\nsuch  conditions are complied with, where you  have  minority\r\n\r\nshareholders  who are foreigners who are able, in  their  own\r\n\r\nways, to exert\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninfluence  on the majority shareholders or even on the  Board\r\n\r\nof  such companies.  In such instances, while these companies\r\n\r\nstill  qualify as Singapore-controlled companies,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure whether or not the company itself may not be subject  to\r\n\r\nthe  control of a foreign party.  If the Minister can clarify\r\n\r\nthis point, it would alleviate our concern on this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I note that under clause 2(5), it provides\r\n\r\nthat  any  donation received by a candidate  or  a  political\r\n\r\nassociation  by  way  of a donation  via  a  trustee  in  his\r\n\r\ncapacity  as  such  shall be regarded as a  donation  from  a\r\n\r\nperson who is not a permissible donor. The question is:   who\r\n\r\nis  a trustee? A trustee is not defined in the Bill.  One can\r\n\r\nlook  to the common law for its meaning. Arguably, it can  be\r\n\r\nsaid that if a person who transfers property to a permissible\r\n\r\ndonor  with the direction that the latter be asked to make  a\r\n\r\ngift  of  that property to a political party or a  candidate,\r\n\r\nclause  2(5) would be triggered and in any event,  clause  23\r\n\r\nwould   equally   apply  in  respect  of  such  arrangements.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir, it is possible to get around restrictions in  a\r\n\r\nnumber of ways. For instance, a foreign donor can give  these\r\n\r\ngifts  to  a  permissible  donor  absolutely  such  that  the\r\n\r\npermissible donor is not the trustee of these gifts. Once  it\r\n\r\nis  determined that these gifts are not held in trust by  the\r\n\r\npermissible  donor, the money can then be channelled  to  the\r\n\r\npolitical party or candidate with whom the permissible  donor\r\n\r\nand the foreign party are equally sympathetic to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, one does not have to, as a foreign donor,\r\n\r\ntransfer property to the permissible donor in order  to  make\r\n\r\nsuch  donations.   Where a foreign donor has strong  business\r\n\r\ninfluence  over a Singapore-controlled company, it  would  be\r\n\r\npossible  for  the Singapore company to make donations  under\r\n\r\nthe influence of the party or the foreign party. Any donation\r\n\r\nmade  can  be compensated in the future through some generous\r\n\r\ncontractual  means  between the Singapore-controlled  company\r\n\r\nand  the foreign party.  In citing this as an example,  I  am\r\n\r\nmindful  that  there are other provisions in  the  Bill  that\r\n\r\nprevent or restrict the circumvention of such restrictions by\r\n\r\nother means. Clause\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n23,   for  instance,  makes  it  illegal  for  a  person  who\r\n\r\nfacilitates  such transactions.  But as we all  know,  it  is\r\n\r\nquite possible, if one is aware of the restrictions in clause\r\n\r\n23, to even circumvent these restrictions.  In sum, it is not\r\n\r\na  foolproof  and  water-tight  provision  and  it  would  be\r\n\r\npossible  under certain circumstances for foreign parties  to\r\n\r\nindirectly make a contribution through a permissible donor in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, if the purpose of the Bill is to maintain\r\n\r\npublic confidence in the political system by preventing money\r\n\r\npolitics, I do not see why distinction has been made  between\r\n\r\na  foreign donor, and for that matter, a local donor who  has\r\n\r\nsubstantial sums of money and can equally be in a position to\r\n\r\ninfluence Government policies through monetary contributions.\r\n\r\nAllowing that person to have an influence on policies through\r\n\r\nfinancial  resources would strike at the very  heart  of  our\r\n\r\nsystem of democracy which seeks to represent the interest  of\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans and not just the moneyed few.   It  is  not\r\n\r\ninconceivable that with the booming economy, there  would  be\r\n\r\nmany local companies and individuals with hoards of cash.  It\r\n\r\nwould generally be conceivable that in an environment that is\r\n\r\nmore  liberal, some would consider putting money through  the\r\n\r\npolitical  system. At the moment, there is  nothing  to  stop\r\n\r\nrich  local  individuals  from donating  money  to  political\r\n\r\nassociations  and candidates.  Fortunately,  this  party  has\r\n\r\nalways  maintained the highest level of integrity.   We  have\r\n\r\nnever  allowed  money  to influence our decisions.   However,\r\n\r\nsince  institutions exist in perpetuity and man does not,  it\r\n\r\nis  vital  that we institutionalise our values by  regulating\r\n\r\nall manner of donations and not just confine the present Bill\r\n\r\nto foreign donations alone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, this Bill, at another level, should not be\r\n\r\nseen as one of regulating the influence of foreign parties on\r\n\r\nlocal  policies.  Against this backdrop, there  is  a  larger\r\n\r\nissue  of money politics. Up until this point in time,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said  earlier,  there  is  an  absence  of  substantial\r\n\r\nspending  on  political campaigns and advertising.  This  has\r\n\r\nhelped  to  keep  the cost of running for a political  office\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHowever,  it would be difficult in trying to win  the  hearts\r\n\r\nand  minds  of  the  electorate  not  to  rely  on  the  mass\r\n\r\ncommunication  media  in  the future  to  reach  out  to  the\r\n\r\nconstituents.    If this happens, the need for funding  would\r\n\r\nobviously  increase.  On principle, there  is  nothing  wrong\r\n\r\nwith getting the public to donate to political parties.  What\r\n\r\nis at issue is the extent to which donors have the ability to\r\n\r\ninfluence  policies through donations. One  way  to  overcome\r\n\r\nthis   concern   is  to  create  a  greater   atmosphere   of\r\n\r\ntransparency in the whole process. I note that the Bill  only\r\n\r\nrequires  accounts  to  be  filed  with  the  Registrar   for\r\n\r\ndonations  above a certain level.  There is  nothing  in  the\r\n\r\nBill  which requires public disclosure of all donations.   It\r\n\r\nis  important  that if you want to have a transparent  system\r\n\r\nthat  such  disclosures be made to the  public.   Making  the\r\n\r\nsystem  and  process transparent would also  have  a  way  of\r\n\r\nchecking  the conduct of political parties and candidates  in\r\n\r\nits  dealings  with  donors.  Additionally,  by  making  such\r\n\r\ndisclosures,  voters  can also make informed  choices  in  an\r\n\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just some final words about what the opposition has\r\n\r\nsaid. They have lamented and griped about how the Bill is yet\r\n\r\nanother  example by the Government to stifle the  opposition.\r\n\r\nThey  have  stated  that the Bill does  not  proscribe  local\r\n\r\ndonations.  There is nothing to stop local donors from giving\r\n\r\nmoney  to  opposition members. They have harped on  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  this  Bill will discourage local donors from  making  a\r\n\r\ndonation because particulars of their donations would have to\r\n\r\nbe  disclosed  to  the  Government agency.   Underlying  that\r\n\r\nstatement  is the assumption that because they  have  made  a\r\n\r\ndonation, prosecutions, or in their term, persecutions  would\r\n\r\nnecessarily follow.  If I may just ask the opposition Members\r\n\r\nwhether  they  are  able  to cite instances  where  such  has\r\n\r\nhappened.   And indeed, in previous years, we  have  found  a\r\n\r\nmore  liberal climate and environment where people  are  more\r\n\r\nprepared to speak up against Government policies. This  is  a\r\n\r\ngiven.  And  in  this  kind of climate,  it  would  be  quite\r\n\r\ndifficult to see how this would gel\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  the general climate of fear that the opposition Members\r\n\r\nhave  painted  that the members of the public  are  suffering\r\n\r\nunder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition Members have also made a second\r\n\r\nassumption, and that is, the politicians are able to  discern\r\n\r\nin  respect of the monies that were given, and still be  able\r\n\r\nto stand up for the principle that they should not be subject\r\n\r\nto  the  influence  of money in the way in  which  they  make\r\n\r\ndecisions.   I believe this to be very naive. No  established\r\n\r\nsociety  can run away from the fact that money does influence\r\n\r\nand  the greater the sum of money, the greater the extent  of\r\n\r\nthe  influence.  I  doubt if we can say  sincerely  that  all\r\n\r\npoliticians, if subject to the influence of money, would  not\r\n\r\nbe influenced in the way in which they decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is precisely because of Singapore 21 that we\r\n\r\nhave   confidence  in  our  people,  in  our   system,   that\r\n\r\nultimately,  when it comes to the crunch,  when  there  is  a\r\n\r\nviable alternative, if for some reason, the integrity of  the\r\n\r\npresent  party  and the leadership is compromised,  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing to stop the citizens of Singapore from supporting the\r\n\r\nopposition. There is nothing to stop them from coming out  in\r\n\r\nthe  open  with  large monetary contributions to  support  an\r\n\r\nalternative view that will surely take us on.  If we  do  not\r\n\r\nperform,  if  the people go without homes or health  services\r\n\r\nare  not looked after, then I certainly do not think  that  a\r\n\r\nrestriction  like  this is going to stop people  from  making\r\n\r\ncontributions to the opposition parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to prevent foreigners from interfering\r\n\r\nwith  the  ability  of  Singaporeans to determine  their  own\r\n\r\ndestiny.   Unless of course the hon. opposition  Members  are\r\n\r\nsaying that they should sell themselves to the foreigners,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve they have no alternative but to support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I would say that, at this\r\n\r\npoint   of  time,  this  Bill  is  quite  unnecessary.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment has always boasted that in Singapore,  we  do  not\r\n\r\nindulge in money politics. As far as I know, there have  been\r\n\r\nno reported cases in any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelection  since  Singapore  became  independent  in  1965  of\r\n\r\ncandidates  wanting to buy votes or to spend  large  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney  to  influence voters.  So why the necessity  for  this\r\n\r\nBill  at this point of time?  Mr Jeyaretnam has a point  when\r\n\r\nhe  wants to know the rationale and the reason for this Bill.\r\n\r\nI think the Minister should oblige.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only case I know of was in the 1976 elections,\r\n\r\nalthough  Mr Jeyaretnam said it was 1972 when a PAP candidate\r\n\r\nwho was returned to Parliament accused the Workers' Party  of\r\n\r\naccepting $600,000 from a foreign source.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> 1972 election.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> 1972. I am much obliged. Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  he  was  roundly  sued by  the  Workers'  Party  for\r\n\r\ndefamation and the PAP candidate was unable to prove that the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party  took any money at all from a foreign  source\r\n\r\nbut,  nevertheless, he won the case based on  technicalities.\r\n\r\nThe  fact that remains till today is that neither the  ruling\r\n\r\nparty nor the opposition parties indulge in any form of money\r\n\r\npolitics.   I  believe the Government is very proud  of  that\r\n\r\nfact  and  has said so many times.  In that case,  I  thought\r\n\r\nthat the status quo would remain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Political Donations Bill therefore comes as a\r\n\r\nsurprise  to  me.  Money politics has not been  part  of  the\r\n\r\npolitical  culture  of  Singapore. As  far  as  I  know,  all\r\n\r\nopposition candidates who took part in the election run their\r\n\r\nelection  campaigns on a shoestring budget.  I  believe  that\r\n\r\ngenerally,  the  PAP candidates spend more on  the  elections\r\n\r\nthan  the  opposition candidates. We can  see  that  the  PAP\r\n\r\nelection rallies are much more posh than the opposition ones.\r\n\r\nWe also notice that in some PAP election rallies, at least at\r\n\r\nthe  ones held in Potong Pasir, the PAP spent money on hiring\r\n\r\nhuge  buses  to  ferry supporters, especially old  folks,  to\r\n\r\nattend  the  election rallies held there. The opposition,  as\r\n\r\nfar  as  I  know,  has not spent any money to  transport  any\r\n\r\nsupporters  to their election rallies. The people  just  come\r\n\r\nspontaneously  to attend opposition rallies.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nopposition,  up  to  today,  has not  spent  much  money  and\r\n\r\ncertainly has not received any money from foreign\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsources.   For  that  reason,  I  wonder  why  this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore there is also a cap on election\r\n\r\nspending.   Candidates are limited at one  time  to  only  50\r\n\r\ncents per voter. But now, the Parliamentary Elections Act has\r\n\r\nbeen  amended to allow a candidate to spend $2.50 per  voter.\r\n\r\nAs  far  as I know, opposition candidates have never exceeded\r\n\r\nthat  limit set down by the law.  I, for myself, have  always\r\n\r\nspent  very  little money.  When I first started in  1976,  I\r\n\r\nspent  only  $3,500 per election.  And at  the  last  general\r\n\r\nelections, I spent not more than $10,000.  But then again, my\r\n\r\nconstituency  of Potong Pasir is the smallest  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  has  only 19,000 voters.  It can therefore be  seen  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no need to spend lots of money to win an election,\r\n\r\nbut only plenty of time and sweat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we ask again: what is the necessity to enact\r\n\r\nthis  law?   Why does the Government suddenly want  political\r\n\r\nparties  and also other organised bodies, whose main activity\r\n\r\nis  in politics, to declare donations given to them?  In  any\r\n\r\nevent,  the law already requires all candidates in  elections\r\n\r\nto  declare the amount of money they spend on each  election.\r\n\r\nI  am  just  wondering whether the Government has  introduced\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  as  it envisages that there is a  possibility  of\r\n\r\ncandidates advertising themselves on TV.  When that comes, of\r\n\r\ncourse, I say lots of money will be needed.  Like in America,\r\n\r\nthe cost of election campaigning escalates dramatically.   In\r\n\r\nthe Presidential elections, I believe that each candidate can\r\n\r\nspend up to $200 million.  But, in Singapore, as there is  no\r\n\r\nelection  campaigning through the TV media, I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nthere is a need for large sums of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, of course, candidates are only allowed\r\n\r\nparty  political broadcast for a few minutes over  the  local\r\n\r\nTV.   The  time  allowed depends on the number of  candidates\r\n\r\nand,  of  course,  this  is  very unfair  to  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties, because many of the opposition parties fielded  less\r\n\r\nthan six candidates and are not allowed even the 21/2 minutes\r\n\r\nbroadcast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opposition says that there is no need for such a law\r\n\r\nat this point in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  only  reason  for  wanting  this  law  is  to  curb  the\r\n\r\nopposition  further.   People who give money  to  the  ruling\r\n\r\nparty  do not mind revealing their names.  But in the context\r\n\r\nof   Singapore  today,  in  our  culture,  people  are  still\r\n\r\ngenerally  fearful  of  being  seen  to  be  supporting   the\r\n\r\nopposition.   For this very reason, I think  this  law  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat disadvantage to the opposition.  Sir, it will leave the\r\n\r\nopposition  parties with a lot of problems in raising  funds.\r\n\r\nAny  political party which cannot account for large  sums  of\r\n\r\nmoney it receives can easily be discredited.  So there is  no\r\n\r\nneed actually for this law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, there was a case when a Minister in the\r\n\r\nruling  party  accepted money from the Americans.   This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  mentioned.   His name is Chew Swee Kee.   When  he  was\r\n\r\nfound  out,  the PAP relished at it.  The PAP, at that  time,\r\n\r\nwas in the opposition.  It publicised the fact and helped the\r\n\r\nPAP  to win the elections in 1959.  The point is that if  any\r\n\r\npolitical party is found to have received money from  abroad,\r\n\r\nit  will definitely be discredited.  Any party which wants to\r\n\r\naccept  money  from foreign sources will have to think  twice\r\n\r\nbefore  it  does  so.  Because, once it  is  found  out,  the\r\n\r\npolitical  effect  will be disastrous.   People  will  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  that party is working for the interest of  Singapore\r\n\r\nor  for  some  foreign powers or foreigners.   A  party  that\r\n\r\naccepts money from foreign sources will be seen as a tool  of\r\n\r\nforeigners  and  cannot  be  trusted.   As  this  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  Bill, I would also support that it be  sent  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee for further deliberations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have just got two more points to raise in regard\r\n\r\nto  the provisions of the Bill.  I think the $5,000 limit for\r\n\r\nanonymous donations is definitely too low.  I do not know how\r\n\r\nthe  Minister has plucked this figure from the air.  I do not\r\n\r\nknow on what basis this figure of $5,000 has been decided.  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest that anonymous donations be allowed up to  the\r\n\r\nlimit of at least $23,000, which is about half the amount  of\r\n\r\nelection  expenses allowed under the Parliamentary  Elections\r\n\r\nAct for Potong Pasir constituency, which is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsmallest constituency in Singapore.  I think that is  a  fair\r\n\r\nbasis to take, half of the election expenses which is allowed\r\n\r\nfor  Potong Pasir constituency.  I think that cannot probably\r\n\r\neven support two candidates.  So what harm can it do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next provision I would like to comment is on clause\r\n\r\n12    -  annual donation report.  Sir, this is important.   I\r\n\r\nheard from the Minister that it cannot be divulged to members\r\n\r\nof  the  public.  If it cannot be divulged to members of  the\r\n\r\npublic, it must at least  be divulged to the opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the PAP is the Government. It can, at any time,\r\n\r\nsee  the  political donations report.  Is  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nPolitical   Donations  going  to  swear  under  a   statutory\r\n\r\ndeclaration  that he will not show those reports  to  anyone,\r\n\r\neven  to members of the Government?    Sir, on this point,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Government must be transparent.  If the Government\r\n\r\nis  not  transparent, I am certain that people  will  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  can have a chance  to  peep  at  those\r\n\r\nreports  but no one else can.  In other words, Sir,  this  is\r\n\r\nlike  playing  cards where I show you all my cards,  but  you\r\n\r\nkeep  your cards only to your chest.  I think members of  the\r\n\r\npublic  would like to know who are the people who  donate  to\r\n\r\nthe  PAP,  even  if  it  is their members  or  the  Ministers\r\n\r\nthemselves.  I think this must be seen to be transparent.  If\r\n\r\nit is not, I am afraid the Political Donations Bill will have\r\n\r\nno  credibility at all.  Sir, the opposition would demand for\r\n\r\ncomplete transparency, as far as this point is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I will try to answer as many as\r\n\r\npossible  the points raised by Members.  Generally,  I  think\r\n\r\nMembers support the need for the Bill.  As to why we want  to\r\n\r\nprohibit  foreign  funding  to  the  political  parties   and\r\n\r\npolitical  associations which have an effect on the political\r\n\r\nactivities  and development of Singapore, we all  agree  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's politics is for Singaporeans, and not for  others\r\n\r\nto  come  and  interfere via any means, whether by  financial\r\n\r\nmeans  or  other  assistance.   Because,  whatever  form  the\r\n\r\nassistance  takes,  there is no question that  the  recipient\r\n\r\nwill, in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome  way or other, be beholden to that foreign organisation.\r\n\r\nAnd  I do not think any Singaporean organisation or political\r\n\r\nparty  will  want  to put itself in that  position  of  being\r\n\r\nbeholden to a foreign organisation, and I think this point is\r\n\r\nrightly pointed out by Mr Chiam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we actually do not need a lot of money for\r\n\r\nelections.   The Parliamentary Elections Act lays down  quite\r\n\r\nclearly  how  much each candidate can spend, ie, up to  $2.50\r\n\r\nper  voter, and that is the cap.  And it is not an  expensive\r\n\r\naffair  to run a campaign in Singapore.  Unlike the  case  of\r\n\r\nmany other countries where candidates have to spend millions,\r\n\r\nif  not  hundreds of millions of dollars, to  secure  even  a\r\n\r\nprimary  candidacy, or as a candidate for, say, the  American\r\n\r\nPresidential elections.  In Singapore, there is no such  need\r\n\r\nand therefore it is easy.  The cost of entry into politics by\r\n\r\nany Singaporean who has an interest to take part in elections\r\n\r\nis easy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for the PAP, we have taken upon ourselves to\r\n\r\nobserve  very strict rules about donations to the party.   No\r\n\r\nmoney  goes  to  the Ministers or the MPs  direct.   Whatever\r\n\r\ndonation  does  not go to the individual.   It  goes  to  the\r\n\r\nparty.   And  we  also make it clear that  whoever  give  the\r\n\r\ndonation can expect no favour and can expect no preference in\r\n\r\nwhatever dealings they may have with the Government  or  with\r\n\r\nthe  party.  They do donate and we tell them that they do  it\r\n\r\nbecause  they  believe  that the PAP  has  been  running  the\r\n\r\ncountry  well  and they want to support an organisation  like\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  to perpetuate the prosperity of Singapore, not  for\r\n\r\nany  other  reason.  It is not to support the PAP  to  favour\r\n\r\nthem in their business or in their personal affairs.  That is\r\n\r\nthe basic rule of the PAP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, this Bill does not prohibit anyone who\r\n\r\nhas  an  interest  to  donate  to  the  political  party   or\r\n\r\nassociation,  so long as he is a permissible donor.   And  we\r\n\r\nmust have the rules such that we can ensure that the donation\r\n\r\ncomes  from permissible donors.  On the occasion that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot,  because a Singaporean donor or a permissible source  is\r\n\r\nprepared to allow\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhimself  to  be used as a conduit for a foreign organisation,\r\n\r\nthen  he  will have to take full responsibility for that  and\r\n\r\nanswer for the consequences.  So, it is not possible, like Mr\r\n\r\nKenneth Chen suggests, to cover all loopholes, or even Mr Goh\r\n\r\nChoon  Kang's suggestion to ensure that we have no loopholes.\r\n\r\nThere will be some and I think we will have to learn from the\r\n\r\nexperience as we operate this Bill, which eventually  becomes\r\n\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a general point whether this will really affect\r\n\r\nthe  growth of civil society.  I do not think so.   Even  for\r\n\r\nthe  civil  society  or any organisation  that  has  a  civic\r\n\r\npurpose,  there is no reason why it should depend on  foreign\r\n\r\nfunding  in  whatever form.  They must depend on  themselves.\r\n\r\nThey  must depend on Singaporeans who believe in their cause.\r\n\r\nWe  do not want a situation where a foreign organisation will\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Yes,  this is the cause I believe in and  therefore  I\r\n\r\nchampion  your  cause for you by providing you  with  money.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  I have explained in great detail what we consider to  be\r\n\r\npolitics and what we consider to be political activities.   I\r\n\r\neven  outlined  six or seven conditions under which  we  will\r\n\r\nconsider those to be politics and political activities, and I\r\n\r\nthink they were clear enough.  Of course, when it comes to an\r\n\r\nactual case, I think judgment will need to be applied and  we\r\n\r\nwill  need to distinguish between activities by groups  which\r\n\r\nwant  to  promote  a social cause for the  public  good,  not\r\n\r\nleading  to a change in the political structure, not  leading\r\n\r\nto  a change in the law, not leading to the way we want to do\r\n\r\nour own things, and we want to decide that for ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are also groups that will want\r\n\r\nto  push  very clearly for a political or partisan agenda  to\r\n\r\nalter our political system.  That is a distinction we want to\r\n\r\nmake.    But   again,  it  will  have  to   depend   on   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  So I cannot answer very specifically in  such\r\n\r\na  situation whether we will allow or not allow.  In the end,\r\n\r\nit  will  have to depend on the circumstances and  eventually\r\n\r\nwhen  a decision is made to gazette an organisation which  is\r\n\r\nnot  a political party as a political association and subject\r\n\r\nto  this Bill, I will make the rationale known and why we  do\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  this can be challenged.  The association can go  to  the\r\n\r\ncourts  for  a  judicial review of the  Minister's  decision.\r\n\r\nThat  is a completely transparent system.  But to ask me  now\r\n\r\nto  detail  from  A  to Z what is covered  and  what  is  not\r\n\r\ncovered, it is not possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot speculate on hypothetical situations. But I\r\n\r\ncan  give  an  example.   For  example,  organisations  which\r\n\r\nreceive, say, funding from a UN organisation, UNDP or UNICEF,\r\n\r\nto  promote  a  social  programme to  address  the  needs  of\r\n\r\nchildren, are obviously the organisations in the first  group\r\n\r\nthat  I will not consider to be organisations that are within\r\n\r\nthe  prohibition  of  foreign donations,  because  for  these\r\n\r\nassociations, they are actually doing a social  programme  to\r\n\r\nhelp  children  or battered wives for that  matter.   On  the\r\n\r\nother hand, if local organisations accept foreign funds, say,\r\n\r\nfrom a foreign body like the Soros Foundation network to help\r\n\r\nthem promote in Singapore a political programme based on what\r\n\r\nthey  think Singapore's society or political structure should\r\n\r\nbe, we will deem them to be in the second category, that they\r\n\r\nwill be a political association covered by the Bill, if these\r\n\r\nSingapore  associations  do accept money  from  such  foreign\r\n\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singaporeans truly want to have a political society\r\n\r\nof   whatever   form,  whether  it  is  the   NUS   Political\r\n\r\nAssociation, whether it is the Democratic Socialist Club, the\r\n\r\nRoundtable, Socratic Circle, or whatever, let it be supported\r\n\r\nby  Singaporeans.   It is only fair that whatever  activities\r\n\r\npropagated  by  these organisations should  be  supported  by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, and not by foreign sources.  So it is  not  the\r\n\r\nintention  of  this Bill to retard the growth  of  any  civil\r\n\r\nsociety  group.   In  fact,  it is the  Government  that  has\r\n\r\ngenerated  this  interest.   The  Government  generated  this\r\n\r\ninterest by having a Singapore 21 Committee chaired by   RAdm\r\n\r\nTeo Chee Hean involving a lot of Singaporeans.  We say, \"Come\r\n\r\nand  take  part.   Make  sure that you have  an  interest  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  its continued prosperity and success.  Therefore,\r\n\r\ndo not just leave everything\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto the Government and have a say in things that will interest\r\n\r\nyou  or  affect  you.\"   So  it is the  Government  that  has\r\n\r\ngenerated this interest and there is no particular reason why\r\n\r\nthe  Government wants to restrict the growth of  these  civil\r\n\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, should such groups or organisations\r\n\r\ncome to the Government to ask for money, the question to  ask\r\n\r\nis:  should  Government money be used for  their  purpose  or\r\n\r\nshould  it be for a general purpose of all Singaporeans?   We\r\n\r\ncannot,  on  the one hand, say, \"Please, give me money.\"  And\r\n\r\nnext  say,  \"Please, let me be independent and completely  be\r\n\r\nleft  alone.\"  When they receive Government money, they  will\r\n\r\nbe subject to Government influence in some way or other.  But\r\n\r\nif they want to be totally independent, then they must depend\r\n\r\non  themselves and on people, Singaporeans, who will  support\r\n\r\ntheir cause.  Then they will be completely independent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas asked me to define \"sponsorship\" and whether\r\n\r\ndinners,  research,  etc.  are considered  as  \"sponsorship\".\r\n\r\nAgain,  I really cannot explain in great detail what  is  and\r\n\r\nwhat  is not considered as sponsorship.  We will have to look\r\n\r\nat  the whole circumstances and the context before a decision\r\n\r\ncan be made, which eventually can be challenged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On anonymous donations, he asked why not limit to less\r\n\r\nthan $100 and therefore has no limit of $5,000 in total.   We\r\n\r\nhave   applied   different  rules  according   to   our   own\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   In Britain or America, they cannot  have  an\r\n\r\nanonymous  donation of more than pound 50 or more  than  $50.\r\n\r\nIf they can generate 100,000 donors, so be it.  In Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  think that $5,000 a year is pretty reasonable.  If,  over\r\n\r\ntime,  we  think  that  that sum is not  enough  because  the\r\n\r\npolitical  associations' expenses have grown and  so  on,  we\r\n\r\nwill look at that.  This is the first time we have a Bill and\r\n\r\nthis  is  the first time that we have started something  like\r\n\r\nthat after examining all the examples of other countries, and\r\n\r\nwe  say,  let  us  give it a try.  It will  not  be  cast  in\r\n\r\nconcrete and stone.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWith  the  experience that we have gained,  and  difficulties\r\n\r\nthat  we may experience, we will amend the Bill as time  goes\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question which two or three of our opposition\r\n\r\nMembers want to know is: why have this Bill now?  What is the\r\n\r\nurgency?  I do not think there is any better time than having\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  now.  Consciousness has been raised on  political\r\n\r\nfunding,  soft  money, soft advertisement and  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nthings  that have happened in other countries for years.   If\r\n\r\nMembers  remember the 1996 Presidential Election in  America,\r\n\r\nit  has  long  past for years, and now the controversy  still\r\n\r\nrages  on.  In our newspapers the last couple of weeks  since\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  was  made  known,  the newspapers  have  run  many\r\n\r\nstories, and Singaporeans ought to know that there is such  a\r\n\r\nproblem  in  other countries.  In Singapore's case,  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  always  thrives  on  its  ability  to  anticipate\r\n\r\nproblems.   We  are  not saying that the  problem  will  come\r\n\r\nstraightaway  tomorrow, in the next  election,  but  we  will\r\n\r\nnever know.  So let us have the law ready.  Today is as  good\r\n\r\nas any other day.\r\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members say, do not bring back the history of 1959 or\r\n\r\ndo  not  talk about 1976 or 1988, these are real examples  of\r\n\r\nhow  foreign governments, whether it is a government directed\r\n\r\nat  the top or by somebody at the top, or somebody else doing\r\n\r\nthe  job,  or a foreign intelligence organisation,  like  the\r\n\r\n1976  case,  or just one diplomat in an embassy, these  cases\r\n\r\nhappened and they are real examples.  Do we need to wait  for\r\n\r\nmore  examples before we say, \"Let us do something about it.\"\r\n\r\nWhat  will Singaporeans say?  They will say, \"There you  are,\r\n\r\nyou  are not doing your job. You should know that these  have\r\n\r\nbeen  happening in other countries and yet you  are  slow  in\r\n\r\nresponding.   We thought we pay you a lot of money  to  do  a\r\n\r\ngood job.\"  So let us not fool ourselves. We do not know that\r\n\r\nsuch  a  problem will come about.  Neither do we want such  a\r\n\r\nproblem to come about.  But there is no reason why we  should\r\n\r\nnot have a law like that today.  Because today is better than\r\n\r\nnever.  It is better than tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang is worried about anonymous donations\r\n\r\nand  now he cannot raise money because even people are afraid\r\n\r\nto  give him 50 cents.  That fear is really not well founded.\r\n\r\nIf   Singaporeans  want  to  give  him  money,  what  is  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  saying,  \"I  am a  Singaporean.  This  is  my\r\n\r\nidentity card.  Please record it.\"  What is their worry?   It\r\n\r\nis  a  simple  thing.  That procedure does not apply  to  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party or to the SDP only.  It applies to the PAP  as\r\n\r\nwell.   It  applies  to all the PAP's 83  branches.   When  I\r\n\r\nbriefed my GPC, they said this is going to cause problems for\r\n\r\nthem  to keep detailed records.  I said so be it, because  we\r\n\r\nwant this system to be established today.  The Party will set\r\n\r\nup  the structure, a record keeping method, to make sure that\r\n\r\nwe  record.   If  the opposition is really  shorthanded,  and\r\n\r\ncannot find people to help them understand the system, I have\r\n\r\nasked  my  officials to come up with a simple guide  to  help\r\n\r\nthem to capture such records.  We hope that can be useful  to\r\n\r\nthem.   But  it  is  up  to them.  They can  keep  their  own\r\n\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Without any administrative\r\n\r\nassistants how do we keep records?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> The Member is paid $250 and $500 to\r\n\r\nemploy  a  secretarial  assistant and  legislative  assistant\r\n\r\nrespectively.  He can use that money.  If the Government were\r\n\r\nto  give more money to the Member to employ an administrative\r\n\r\nassistant  to  keep  records, we will only  give  it  to  two\r\n\r\nopposition Members, one from the Workers' Party and the other\r\n\r\nfrom  SPP, and the rest will go to the PAP Members.  He  will\r\n\r\nthen  say  this is unfair because the PAP has more  MPs.   We\r\n\r\nwill  settle  our own problems.  He settles his and  we  will\r\n\r\nsettle by our method.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam is concerned that the list of donors is only\r\n\r\nmade  known  to  the PAP.  That would not be  the  case.   No\r\n\r\nmember of the public will have access to this record.  It  is\r\n\r\nonly  the officials.  He asked me whether the Ministers  will\r\n\r\nsee  the list of donors.  There is no need for us to  do  so.\r\n\r\nThe  purpose of this Bill is not to find out who  donated  to\r\n\r\nthe Workers' Party, SDP or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhoever,  or  even the PAP.  It is up to them to  decide  who\r\n\r\nthey  want  to receive the money from.  If we know who  their\r\n\r\ndonors  are,  so what?  How does that affect  them?   Are  we\r\n\r\ngoing  to chase after their donors?  Is the PAP going to  run\r\n\r\nafter  their donors so that they will say, \"Let us have  your\r\n\r\nmoney instead of it going to the  Workers' Party?\"  Let us be\r\n\r\nrealistic.   We  do  not need the people who  give  them  the\r\n\r\nmoney.  We have other people who give us money.  We give  the\r\n\r\nmoney  ourselves.  Most of the money that goes into the Party\r\n\r\nfor  election purposes comes from the PAP MPs and  Ministers.\r\n\r\nWe  paid  for our expenses.  Of course, there are also  other\r\n\r\nwell-wishers who help us.  So be it.   If others want to help\r\n\r\nthe opposition, fine! Go ahead.  But nobody is interested  in\r\n\r\nknowing who their donors are and I do not think that we  need\r\n\r\nto  make known the list of donors.  In fact, by making  known\r\n\r\nthe  list of donors, it will discourage people from donating.\r\n\r\nThey  may  say  that in that case they would  rather  not  be\r\n\r\nknown,  whether to be known to be supporting the PAP  or  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party or the SPP. What for?  Why all  the  hassles?\r\n\r\nLet  us  keep our money and enjoy ourselves.  So it is better\r\n\r\nthat  we  do  not disclose the list but only to keep  it  for\r\n\r\nrecord purposes and use the records when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam's long list of other points really just\r\n\r\nboils  down  to one thing.  He thinks that this is  going  to\r\n\r\nstifle  the  Workers' Party, and the failure of the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  to get money and people is the fault of the PAP.   How\r\n\r\ncan  this  be  so?  He has led the party for 28  years  since\r\n\r\n1972,  and  maybe even before that.  For 28  years  what  has\r\n\r\nchanged  in the Workers' Party?  Not very much, but  yet  the\r\n\r\nworld  has moved on.  It has changed a lot.  What has changed\r\n\r\nin  the  Workers' Party?  People will know that  it  has  not\r\n\r\nchanged very much.  What has changed in the PAP?  A lot.  And\r\n\r\nthat  is  how  we  have  kept ourselves relevant  and  stayed\r\n\r\nrelevant.  That is why the people say, \"That is the  Party  I\r\n\r\nwant to run Singapore, and we will continue to vote you,  not\r\n\r\nthe  party that cannot even get its acts together.\"  If  they\r\n\r\ncannot even get their acts together, how\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  they get Singapore together?  Let us face it.  So do not\r\n\r\nblame their problems on us.  If they cannot attract people to\r\n\r\njoin  them,  do not blame us.  If they cannot get  people  to\r\n\r\ndonate money to them, do not blame us either.  They only have\r\n\r\nthemselves to blame.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other litany of things is about digging up the\r\n\r\nbackground.   Actually he dug up all the background  himself.\r\n\r\nI  have  even  forgotten  about the case  in  1972  when  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party tried to sue one of the PAP MPs and the  case\r\n\r\nwent  to  court and failed and that led to all  his  troubles\r\n\r\neventually.  That has got nothing to do with the PAP.  It  is\r\n\r\nthe  courts.  He believes in the court system.  He  took  the\r\n\r\ncase  to court and lost.  He challenged it and he still lost.\r\n\r\nHow  could  that  be our fault?  Whether it was  a  technical\r\n\r\nreason or whatever it was, he lost.  If he believes that F.A.\r\n\r\nChua  had been biased, he should have taken up the case.   He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  because  of  this case in 1972,  we  amended  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  to  make  sure that  we  cannot  surrender  our\r\n\r\nsovereignty to a foreign power or foreign country  without  a\r\n\r\nreferendum.   He  has forgotten that this change  came  about\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Workers' Party, he himself in  particular,  was\r\n\r\ncalling  for  the re-merger of Singapore.  All right,  if  he\r\n\r\nwants to do that, he must go through a referendum.  Supposing\r\n\r\nit  happened that the Workers' Party came into power in  1972\r\n\r\nor 1976 ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask by way of clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Minister giving way?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> No. Please sit down.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He is not giving way.

Singaporeans are  more  vocal.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  supported  many  organisations,  set   up\r\n\r\nwebsites,  etc.   And I think they have  also  grown  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical   process.

Is  that purposely making it difficult  for  the\r\n\r\nopposition to keep accounts and to make it more difficult for\r\n\r\nthe  opposition to receive small sums, knowing that we depend\r\n\r\na  lot  on  small sum donors whereas I believe PAP would  not\r\n\r\nneed the money?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask my question as well.

Frankly,\r\n\r\nI do not even know that the opposition receive a lot of small\r\n\r\ndonations  and  neither am I bothered about it.   But,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  for  the $5,000, it is just a macro number,  it  is  a\r\n\r\ntotal sum, it makes it easier for them to receive small  sums\r\n\r\nof  anonymous donations up to $5,000 without keeping  record.\r\n\r\nIf they have to keep record, and we make the limit at $50,  I\r\n\r\nthink  they will be very much troubled by it.

The term \"political association\" which is to\r\n\r\nbe  applied to other than registered political parties should\r\n\r\nbe  spelt  out with greater certainty.  The Bill, as  it  now\r\n\r\nstands, reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\" \"political associations\" means -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) an organisation . whose objects or activities\r\n\r\nrelate wholly or mainly to politics in Singapore and which is\r\n\r\ndeclared by the Minister, by order in the Gazette,  to  be  a\r\n\r\npolitical association for the purposes of this Act;\".\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nThe  operative words are \"whose objects or activities  relate\r\n\r\nwholly or mainly to politics\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, politics is something that concerns the general\r\n\r\npopulace.   That is politics.  So if there is an organisation\r\n\r\nthat  wishes to speak on something which concerns the general\r\n\r\npopulace  or  even  a  section of the community,  it  can  be\r\n\r\ndescribed as being a political association.  We take the case\r\n\r\nof  the women's organisation, AWARE, which is concerned  with\r\n\r\nthe  rights of women and violence to women. Does it become  a\r\n\r\npolitical  association?   Of course,  their  concern  can  be\r\n\r\ncalled  political because it affects a large section  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity, the women in Singapore.  For that reason, is it to\r\n\r\nbe  considered a political association?  What about NGOs?  We\r\n\r\ndo  not have many NGOs in Singapore.  But we have one or  two\r\n\r\nnow,  concerned  not with promoting any particular  political\r\n\r\nissue  or political object, but have, as its aims and object,\r\n\r\nthe  promotion of greater democracy, greater transparency and\r\n\r\ngreater  accountability for the society.  Is that  political?\r\n\r\nOf  course,  it  is, if you want.  But is it an  organisation\r\n\r\nthat  is  attempting  to influence any particular  policy  or\r\n\r\nobject  for Singapore when it is simply concerned with giving\r\n\r\npeople a greater share in decision making?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the Open Singapore Centre (OSC) of which I am the\r\n\r\nChairman.   We  have said that our aim is simply  to  promote\r\n\r\ntransparency   and   accountability   through   openness   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Is that politics?  Of course, one can say yes, it\r\n\r\nis political.  But that is something that concerns the entire\r\n\r\npopulace  in  Singapore.  So why should that  be  declared  a\r\n\r\npolitical association?  It is not concerned with promoting  a\r\n\r\nparticular  issue  or  calling  for  a  particular  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation  in  this country.  All it  seeks  to  do  is  to\r\n\r\npromote  openness,  awareness and  accountability  among  the\r\n\r\npublic.   The other objection is that the power is  given  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister to declare which organisation is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolitical association for the purposes of this Act.   I  have\r\n\r\nno  doubt  that  the Open Singapore Centre will  be  declared\r\n\r\npolitical, if not the other organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My recommendation to the Government is that that\r\n\r\ndecision  as  to  whether  an  organisation  is  a  political\r\n\r\nassociation or not should not be left to the Minister.  We do\r\n\r\nnot  have  any  Elections Commissioner.  We do not  have  any\r\n\r\nElection  Commission. It therefore should be left to somebody\r\n\r\ncompletely  outside the Government, someone independent,  and\r\n\r\nwho  is  appointed for this purpose in consultation with  the\r\n\r\nother  political parties in Singapore so that he  may,  after\r\n\r\nlistening  to  the  organisation itself  or  other  political\r\n\r\nparties  as  to  what  they think, then  decide  whether  the\r\n\r\norganisation is a political association for the  purposes  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill.   That is important if we are going to  encourage\r\n\r\nthe  setting  up  of NGOs in Singapore for the  good  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NGOs exist in almost every other country. But they are\r\n\r\na  rare  commodity in Singapore.  And from what I can see  of\r\n\r\nthe UK Bill, which is before Parliament, it does not prohibit\r\n\r\nNGOs  from  receiving  funds from  overseas.   It  is  common\r\n\r\nknowledge  that  a number of the NGOs in the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nhave  links with other NGOs overseas and they get funds.   So\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the objection to allowing organisations which  have\r\n\r\ngot  nothing  to do with promoting any particular  policy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore from functioning in Singapore for the good  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  receiving money, if necessary, from  like-minded\r\n\r\norganisations outside Singapore?  For example, if we  have  a\r\n\r\nhuman rights organisation, I would love to see one here, what\r\n\r\nis   wrong  with  the  human  rights  organisation  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries saying, \"Well, we got to help you to carry out your\r\n\r\nwork.   We  will  give you some money.\"  What is  wrong  with\r\n\r\nthat?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clause on the same theme is the appointment of\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar.   This is provided in clause 7  which  reads,\r\n\r\n\"The Minister may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint  a\r\n\r\npublic officer to be the Registrar of Political Donations for\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npurposes of this Act, and such number of Assistant Registrars\r\n\r\nof Political Donations as he considers necessary.\"  By clause\r\n\r\n29  of this Bill, the Registrar is given sweeping powers.  By\r\n\r\nclause 29, the Registrar may call upon any person to produce,\r\n\r\nfor  his  inspection, any books, documents or  other  records\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the  income and expenditure  of  the  political\r\n\r\nassociation as the Registrar may reasonably require.  He  may\r\n\r\nalso  call  upon them to furnish him or any person authorised\r\n\r\nby  him  with  all information, explanation relating  to  the\r\n\r\nincome and expenditure of any political association.  And  by\r\n\r\nsub-clause (3) of this clause, he is empowered to  enter  any\r\n\r\npremises  occupied  by  the  political  association  at   any\r\n\r\nreasonable  time, even if he is not required to give  notice,\r\n\r\nand to inspect any books, documents or other records relating\r\n\r\nto the income and expenditure of the political association.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Your time is up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I make a few points on a\r\n\r\nparticular clause?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I am referring to clause 21 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  This clause requires multiple small donations  to\r\n\r\npolitical  associations to be reported to the Registrar.   It\r\n\r\nseems  to me that even if these people are permissible donors\r\n\r\nand  if  they donate more than $10,000 a year, in  aggregate,\r\n\r\nthe  donor  has to report to the Registrar and give  all  the\r\n\r\nnecessary details.  May I know what is the rationale of  this\r\n\r\nclause  in the Bill?  And does this clause violate the rights\r\n\r\nof   Singaporeans  in  making  donations?   Is   it   not   a\r\n\r\ndiscrimination against making donations to political parties?\r\n\r\nYou  can  donate  whatever amount you want  to  the  National\r\n\r\nKidney Foundation, or anywhere.  But why is it that when  you\r\n\r\nare    making   multiple   small   donations   to   political\r\n\r\nassociations, you are required under the Bill  to  report  to\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar and the punishment for failing  to  report  is\r\n\r\nquite hefty?  Why is it so?  What is the rationale?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam was not listening\r\n\r\nwhen   I   was   explaining   the   meaning   of   \"political\r\n\r\nassociations\",  and  what would be  covered  and  under  what\r\n\r\ncircumstances  would  the  Minister  make  a  declaration  or\r\n\r\ngazette  that they would be political associations.   I  have\r\n\r\nexplained  in great detail the circumstances, and I  gave  an\r\n\r\nexample.   On his question about AWARE, I gave an example  in\r\n\r\nfact and said that if AWARE depends on the money to help  the\r\n\r\nbattered wives or children in the Family Service Centre,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  so be it, if it is not campaigning for a particular\r\n\r\ncause to change the law or the Government, and therefore they\r\n\r\ncan   accept   such   foreign  donations.    If   any   other\r\n\r\norganisation, say, an NGO, wants to receive money from  like-minded  people or organisation overseas, and that purpose  is\r\n\r\nto  influence the political issues in Singapore, then it says\r\n\r\nthat  these  are impermissible sources if such organisations,\r\n\r\nor NGOs, are gazetted as a political association.  Right now,\r\n\r\nI  have no intention to gazette any organisation.  But if  he\r\n\r\nsays   his  OSC  is  going  to  get  money  from  like-minded\r\n\r\norganisations overseas to support his political cause, then I\r\n\r\nwill have to take a look at it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask by way of clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Wong, are you giving way?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Go ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Why does the Minister consider the\r\n\r\npromotion   of   greater   democracy,   accountability    and\r\n\r\ntransparency  to be something undesirable for Singapore  when\r\n\r\nit  has  got  nothing  to  do with promoting  any  particular\r\n\r\nlegislation or policy for this country?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Nowhere have I said in my speech just\r\n\r\nnow  that the promotion of democracy or political protest  in\r\n\r\nSingapore by Singaporean is undesirable.  Nowhere have I said\r\n\r\nthat.   But if a particular organisation is going to  stretch\r\n\r\nits  hands out and ask for a donation from a so-called \"like-minded  organisation\" overseas to support his cause, I  would\r\n\r\nthink we should, and every\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporean  should,  examine  the  motive  as  to  why  that\r\n\r\norganisation wants to give the money.  The political  process\r\n\r\nin  Singapore is for Singaporeans to decide.  It is  not  for\r\n\r\nforeigners to come here and help us champion our  cause.   If\r\n\r\nhe has reasons  to receive foreign money, then he should also\r\n\r\nhave  the motive questioned.  Right now, there is no question\r\n\r\nthat I am going to gazette any organisation.  But if there is\r\n\r\ncause to do so, then we would do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talks about the powers of the Registrar.\r\n\r\nThe powers are there just in case the Registrar is obstructed\r\n\r\nfrom doing his work in examining the books, he would have  to\r\n\r\ngo  into the premises to examine the books.  If such books or\r\n\r\naccounts  are not made available, then he must find  ways  to\r\n\r\nget access to such records and there is no reason for anybody\r\n\r\nto  fear.  If that organisation has not done anything  wrong,\r\n\r\nthen  that  organisation should have no  fear.   There  is  a\r\n\r\nChinese  saying  that  says, \"if he  has  not  done  anything\r\n\r\nharmful, then even a knock on the door in the middle  of  the\r\n\r\nnight should not frighten him\".  But in Singapore, it is such\r\n\r\na  small place.  If we do not want people to do it, do not do\r\n\r\nit  because  one  day, he will be found out.  There  is  also\r\n\r\nanother  Chinese saying, \"ruo yao ren bu zhi, chu fei  ji  mo\r\n\r\nwei\" which means if we do not want people to know, do not  do\r\n\r\nit.   If he thinks he has done something wrong, then he  will\r\n\r\nhave to account for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Can I seek a clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think he has enough of the time.\r\n\r\nLet me finish answering Mr Low Thia Khiang.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked why we want to have reports on donors who\r\n\r\nmake multiple donations that amount to $10,000.  I thought  I\r\n\r\nhave  explained  that  in  my statement.   If  an  individual\r\n\r\ndonates less than $10,000, there is no need for the donor  to\r\n\r\nwrite  to  the  Registrar to declare.  If that donor  donates\r\n\r\n$10,000, there is also no need for him to declare because the\r\n\r\npolitical association or party would have declared.

But what is wrong  with  a  permissible\r\n\r\ndonor  making  donations amounting to more  than  $10,000  to\r\n\r\nindividual organisations?

That  is\r\n\r\nmy  subject of this afternoon's talk, not just simply on  the\r\n\r\nSpeakers'  Corner,  but  the pretence  that  because  we  are\r\n\r\nsetting up a Speakers' Corner, there is freedom of expression\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.40 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said more than once, in Singapore, there is a\r\n\r\nlot of pretence by the Government about what Singapore is,  a\r\n\r\npretence that things are not what they really are and that is\r\n\r\nwhat  concerns me.  I have been asked by a number  of  people\r\n\r\nwhy  am  I  so dismissive of the proposed plan to  set  up  a\r\n\r\nSpeakers' Corner.  Well-meaning people have said to  me,  \"Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam,  why  are you so dismissive? It  is  at  least  a\r\n\r\nbeginning.  Why don't you welcome a beginning of the  freedom\r\n\r\nof  expression?\"  I have no objection to that if it is hailed\r\n\r\nas  a  beginning of the freedom of expression  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut it is not.  What it has been hailed is that it is another\r\n\r\ninstance  of  giving greater opportunities in a freedom  that\r\n\r\nalready exists in Singapore when the freedom does not  exist.\r\n\r\nFreedom of expression is not simply limited to be able to say\r\n\r\nsomething.  An integral part of it is the right  of  assembly\r\n\r\nand  that is not going to be afforded by the Speakers' Corner\r\n\r\nbeing set up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We only just recently seen thousands upon thousands of\r\n\r\nwomen  marching  in  Washington to protest  against  the  gun\r\n\r\nviolence  in  that  country.  Is that possible  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday?  Could people turn out to protest against something in\r\n\r\nthe  society?  That is real freedom of expression.   We  have\r\n\r\nalso seen people protesting, coming out to speak against  the\r\n\r\nshooting  in the United States by police officers of innocent\r\n\r\npeople  whom  they suspected of having committed an  offence.\r\n\r\nThere  were two incidents and it provoked an outcry.  But  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, would that be possible?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had the recent case of a shooting by two police\r\n\r\nofficers  of a man who they said was armed with an iron  rod.\r\n\r\nThe Party\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nissued  a  press  release, calling upon the  two  men  to  be\r\n\r\ncharged  with  murder  and  saying  that  if  they  had   any\r\n\r\njustification,  they could prove the justification  in  court\r\n\r\nand  they  will  be  acquitted.  We  said  that  because  the\r\n\r\nCommander  of  the division to which the two police  officers\r\n\r\nwere  attached  immediately  raised  justification  for   the\r\n\r\nshooting  of  the man.  The Straits Times, being  a  faithful\r\n\r\nservant  of the Government, did not publish the press release\r\n\r\nas  we  put  it.   We called for the man to be  charged  with\r\n\r\nmurder.  It is covered up in some nebulous words, \"calls  for\r\n\r\nmore action than a Coroner's inquiry\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let us not pretend that there is freedom of\r\n\r\nexpression in Singapore, that people are allowed the  freedom\r\n\r\nto speak up wherever and whenever they wish to speak up, that\r\n\r\nthe  people  have the freedom to assemble peaceably  to  show\r\n\r\ntheir dissatisfaction or discontent over some policy or  over\r\n\r\nany  act  of  the  Government.  All we  have,  now  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment proposes, is setting up of this one space in  Hong\r\n\r\nLim Green and they make so much noise about setting it up and\r\n\r\nholding it up as an example of how free Singapore is, how  it\r\n\r\nallows  its  citizens  to speak up and  this  is  what  I  am\r\n\r\nprotesting about because the whole thing is a pretence.  When\r\n\r\none  comes to look at the conditions that are attached,  even\r\n\r\nto this little symbolism, one can immediately see that is not\r\n\r\nfreedom of expression that is being allowed to the speaker at\r\n\r\nthe  Speakers' Corner.  The Minister, in answering questions,\r\n\r\nproduced a table of the conditions that applied at Hyde  Park\r\n\r\nand in Singapore.  If one looks at that  -  he spelled it out\r\n\r\n-  one can clearly see that the proposed plan continues  with\r\n\r\nthe  curtailment on the freedom of expression  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nIt  does not, in any way, expand that freedom, or open up the\r\n\r\nsociety in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, under the proposed plan, the speaker may not\r\n\r\nspeak  on anything religious in nature.  And that, again,  is\r\n\r\nan   all-catching  phrase,  vague  and  nebulous.   What   is\r\n\r\n\"anything religious in nature\"?  What is wrong, may I ask, if\r\n\r\nsomebody who is a devoted Christian or Muslim stands  up  and\r\n\r\nspeaks on the virtues of his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreligion?   Would he not be allowed to speak?  But then,  are\r\n\r\nyou  not unduly restricting his freedom to speak on something\r\n\r\nwhich   so  vitally  concerns  the  individual,  the  people,\r\n\r\nreligion?  What are you afraid of?  Of course, it is  another\r\n\r\nthing  to  call  upon  people to attack  members  of  another\r\n\r\nreligion.   What  is wrong with him or her  speaking  on  the\r\n\r\nvirtues,  the values, of the religion itself, so that  others\r\n\r\nmay  come to understand the religion better?  But that is not\r\n\r\nallowed.   So  you  are cutting down on  a  major  aspect  of\r\n\r\nfreedom of expression.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it goes on to say that whoever speaks shall not say\r\n\r\nanything  that  may have the potential to cause  feelings  of\r\n\r\nenmity, etc, between races or religious groups.   This  again\r\n\r\nis  as vague as one can get.  What is meant by \"anything that\r\n\r\nmay have the potential to cause feelings of enmity\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take an instance. If a speaker from a minority\r\n\r\ncommunity  stands up and says that his language is neglected;\r\n\r\nthere  should be greater use of his language, because  it  is\r\n\r\none   of  the  official  languages  in  Singapore,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should encourage greater use of his  language  in\r\n\r\nofficial correspondence or in Government offices, would  that\r\n\r\nbe  considered as having the potential to cause  feelings  of\r\n\r\nenmity  between  races?   Do  you consider  that  may  arouse\r\n\r\nfeelings of hostility in another community?  Again,  you  are\r\n\r\ncutting  down  a  major  portion  of  the  freedom   of   the\r\n\r\nindividual.   Every community, every group, should  have  the\r\n\r\nfreedom to speak about matters that concern them.  And if you\r\n\r\nare  not going to allow them to speak because you are worried\r\n\r\nthat  it  may have the potential to cause feelings of enmity,\r\n\r\nthen  you  are telling him to shut up.  You cannot  speak  on\r\n\r\nthis subject at all.  So, where is the freedom of expression?\r\n\r\nIt  is  all this pretence that upsets me and which  I  cannot\r\n\r\naccept.   Let  us be honest with ourselves for once  and  say\r\n\r\nthat,  \"No,  we are not saying that this means that  we  have\r\n\r\ncomplete freedom of expression in Singapore.  This is just  a\r\n\r\nlittle beginning that we are really testing to see whether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  can have freedom of expression in Singapore or not.\"   If\r\n\r\nthe  Government takes that line, then I have no quarrel  with\r\n\r\nit,  but it is the pretence.  That is what I wanted to  speak\r\n\r\nabout this afternoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is this question about registration. I have\r\n\r\nheard  the Minister but I am still not satisfied of the  need\r\n\r\nfor registration.  All that is needed is for the man or woman\r\n\r\nto  produce the identity card to show the officer that he  or\r\n\r\nshe  is  a  Singapore citizen, and then be allowed to  speak.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no need for any records to be kept.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nneed  to ensure that there are no policemen there.  There  is\r\n\r\nno  objection  to  have a police officer there  to  see  that\r\n\r\npersons  who  speak  are the persons  who  have  shown  their\r\n\r\nidentity   cards  and  proved  themselves  to  be   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.  I cannot see the need for their particulars to  be\r\n\r\nrecorded and kept, not just for a day, as I asked whether  it\r\n\r\nwould  be destroyed.  It is going to be kept for five  years.\r\n\r\nWhy?   And  I  have tried to get an answer from the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether these records will be released to anyone.  He has not\r\n\r\nanswered  the  question.   All we get  are  evasive  answers,\r\n\r\nattempting  to laugh away the question, that we  have  better\r\n\r\nthings to do than to keep records and to give to others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has asked whether the speeches would be\r\n\r\nrecorded.   Again, it is laughed at.  And yet, the  Minister,\r\n\r\nwhen  I asked him questions at the last sitting, says we have\r\n\r\nto  keep the records because we need to look at them later if\r\n\r\nthere is any complaint to determine what the speaker has said\r\n\r\nis  against the law or not.  Well, there you have it.   There\r\n\r\nis an admission that the speech will be recorded.  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nhow can you determine what he has said is against the law  or\r\n\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are all these curbs, all these restrictions,\r\n\r\nagainst  persons  speaking out freely without  fear.   He  is\r\n\r\nstill  subjected  to  this fear.  In Singapore,  he  will  be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to the fear that his particulars will be  released\r\n\r\nto the ISD, which I asked the Minister and he has not replied\r\n\r\non\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat.   And Singaporeans know that the ISD has the  power  to\r\n\r\ndetain him or her for 28 days.  Are they going to come up and\r\n\r\nspeak when they know that their names may be released to  the\r\n\r\nISD and they might be called up and questioned?  So where  is\r\n\r\nthe freedom of expression in Singapore?  It is a continuation\r\n\r\nof  what we have had for the last 40 years since the PAP took\r\n\r\nover,  complete curtailment of the freedom of  expression  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  Speakers' Corner  does  not  open  up  the\r\n\r\nfreedom at all.  It is just a pretence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Your time is up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, can I be allowed to say\r\n\r\na little bit more?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> There is no provision for you to\r\n\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the NCMP moved the Adjournment Motion on  three\r\n\r\ngrounds.  First, he is dismissive about the Speakers' Corner.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  he thought that the Speakers' Corner  is  a  great\r\n\r\npretence,  because  of the conditions  tied  down.   Thirdly,\r\n\r\nthere  is a need for registration, and the question  why  the\r\n\r\nspeaker's name and speech need to be recorded.  I thought  he\r\n\r\nwould   come   up   with   something   really   big,   really\r\n\r\nphilosophical,  but he was merely playing  the  old  records.\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to oppose the motion made in the name of  Mr J  B\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam.  The Constitution of Singapore provides  for  the\r\n\r\nright  to freedom of speech and expression.  We have no  need\r\n\r\nfor  a  Speakers'  Corner  to  prove  that  this  freedom  of\r\n\r\nexpression exists in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speakers' Corner must be seen in perspective - it\r\n\r\nis no more than an additional venue for Singaporeans to speak\r\n\r\nup  on  issues of concern to them and it is free of licensing\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speakers' Corner is set up in response to calls for\r\n\r\nan  outdoor venue where people can speak on any subject  they\r\n\r\nwant to without prior application for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na licence.  It is an exemption from the Public Entertainments\r\n\r\nAct.  There is a big difference between having to apply for a\r\n\r\nlicence  and  just putting your name down  and  a  few  other\r\n\r\ndetails   before   proceeding   to   deliver   your   speech.\r\n\r\nRegistration  does  not  require  approval;  it  is  just   a\r\n\r\nnotification, and a check for eligibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NCMP talks about the absence of free speech in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We have always had free speech.  Indeed, no other\r\n\r\ncity  in  Asia has the same ready access to local and foreign\r\n\r\nnews wires, magazines, television and radio channels and  the\r\n\r\nInternet for our citizens to communicate their views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the NCMP's information, there are 72 news\r\n\r\norganisations  or  agencies  in  Singapore,  and   there  are\r\n\r\ncurrently  37 cable TV channels in Singapore, of  which  more\r\n\r\nthan  three-quarters are foreign channels like the  CNN,  BBC\r\n\r\nand  CNBC,  transmitted through SCV, some of which  had  even\r\n\r\nfeatured the hon. Member in their programmes.  In addition to\r\n\r\nthese,  there  are  more  than 5,000 publications,  including\r\n\r\nTime,  The Economist and AWSJ.  Sir, Singapore has become  an\r\n\r\ninternational media and financial centre precisely because we\r\n\r\nallow a free flow of information within our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, including the Opposition MPs, have many\r\n\r\nchannels  of communications.  Opposition Members can  publish\r\n\r\nparty  newsletters,  write books and host Internet  websites.\r\n\r\nIn  effect, you can say and publish anything you want  within\r\n\r\nthe  boundaries  of law, and this applies to  the   Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner.  There is no pretence about it.  These are facts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans have used all these openings to their\r\n\r\nfullest.  We understand that a new generation of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  shown  that they want to be heard and  that  they  have\r\n\r\nviews  and  suggestions to contribute.  We are  listening  to\r\n\r\nthem.   So  it  is  evident in the way they articulate  their\r\n\r\nviews  robustly  in  frequent letters and complaints  to  the\r\n\r\ndomestic  newspapers.  A study of the forum  pages  of  local\r\n\r\nnewspapers shows that readers have been much more forthcoming\r\n\r\nin expressing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir opinions on a range of issues over the past few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member cares to look into the letters that had\r\n\r\nappeared  in The Straits Times' Forum page for the  last  one\r\n\r\nweek  commenting on Kendrick Tan Cheng Kang's case, he  would\r\n\r\nunderstand what I meant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A writer, named Benjie Pedro, whose name sounds a bit\r\n\r\nforeign  to  us, had this to write about the Forum  page,  in\r\n\r\nNovember last year.  Let me quote what he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'At the risk of sounding too patronising, I cannot help\r\n\r\nbut admire the way this country allows issues to be discussed\r\n\r\nand debated through the ST Forum.  With an increasingly vocal\r\n\r\nand  demanding citizenry, it could be anything  from  \"social\r\n\r\nills\"  to  inefficient service to national issues.  The  best\r\n\r\npart  is,  positive response and concrete corrective  actions\r\n\r\nare  actually  taken by the relevant parties (or authorities)\r\n\r\nmost of the time in order to improve the situation.'     \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He concluded:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'People here actually do have a voice, and are being\r\n\r\nheard, just by the mere power of the pen.  Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\na  lot to be truly thankful for.  In another place I know too\r\n\r\nwell,  the  easiest way to get things done is by knowing  the\r\n\r\n\"right  people\"  who could wield influence.   Otherwise,  you\r\n\r\nmight  need  to amass a million signatures for a petition  or\r\n\r\nhold  a massive rally [as proposed by the Member himself]  to\r\n\r\nbe heard.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nIs   the  Member's  proposal  the  only  civilised,  correct,\r\n\r\ndemocratic way?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to the print media, there are also\r\n\r\nregular feedback programmes on TV and an increasingly popular\r\n\r\nmedium  today  is  the talk-back sessions on  radio.   During\r\n\r\nthese sessions, there is a free flow of comments and vigorous\r\n\r\narguments  on  the most current incidents.   And  it  is  not\r\n\r\nconfined only to local TV stations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasingly, many Singaporeans have been forthcoming in\r\n\r\nexpressing   their  views  on  Government   policies,   often\r\n\r\ncritical,  in  live  news and current affairs  programmes  on\r\n\r\nforeign   channels.    Academics,  Members   of   Parliament,\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders and financial analysts and even the man-on-the-street have been featured prominently.  Finally, we  have\r\n\r\nthe  Internet.   I do not think there is a  need  for  me  to\r\n\r\nelaborate more about this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in no society is there absolute\r\n\r\nfreedom  of expression or speech.  Singapore is no exception.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution specifically provides for restrictions to be\r\n\r\nimposed  on freedom of speech in areas such as incitement  of\r\n\r\nany  offence, contempt of court, defamation and public order.\r\n\r\nThis  is the point which the Member fails to understand.   He\r\n\r\nasks,  \"What  is  wrong in allowing a person  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nSpeakers'  Corner and express the virtue of their religion  - if  these people were ready?\"  I believe that similar avenues\r\n\r\nare available.  If the Member is keen to know about Islam  he\r\n\r\ncan  go  to the mosque and listen to the speech about  Islam.\r\n\r\nIf  somebody is keen to know about Buddhism, he can go to the\r\n\r\ntemple and listen to it.  The point is, there is a grey  line\r\n\r\nbetween  preaching the virtue of one religion and criticising\r\n\r\nand comparing it with the others.  We must not forget that  a\r\n\r\nreligious  speech  made in an open area  had,  in  the  past,\r\n\r\ntriggered  a riot that had cost Singapore a lot in  terms  of\r\n\r\nits  religious  harmony.  I think we have talked  about  this\r\n\r\nwhen  we debated on the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Bill\r\n\r\nand  I  believe that the Member is very familiar  about  this\r\n\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been sound reasons why we do not allow public\r\n\r\nmeetings outdoors without a permit.  It was not very long ago\r\n\r\nthat we had this problem.  Mr Wong Kan Seng, in his speech in\r\n\r\nParliament  on  25th April this year, has  already  explained\r\n\r\nthat despite its own reservations on its potential for public\r\n\r\ndisorder,  Government decided that the idea  of  a  Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner  is  worth trying out in view of the  support  it  has\r\n\r\nattracted  from  the  civil  society  groups.   To  reinforce\r\n\r\nGovernment's  sincerity in trying this idea out, considerable\r\n\r\nlatitude would be exercised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The calls for a Speakers' Corner have arisen because the\r\n\r\nworld  is  changing and the limits are wider.  So  Government\r\n\r\nhas responded and shown that ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

There is no shortage of taxis in  the  CBD\r\n\r\nduring the morning peak period, as many taxis carry commuters\r\n\r\ninto  the  CBD.  The waiting time for taxis in  the  CBD  is,\r\n\r\nhowever,  longer  during the evening  peak  period  as  fewer\r\n\r\ncommuters enter the CBD.  Taxi drivers are also less  willing\r\n\r\nto  drive  an  empty cab into the CBD incurring ERP  charges.\r\n\r\nAccording  to LTA's data, the average waiting time for  taxis\r\n\r\nat  taxi  stands  within the CBD is 0.5  minutes  during  the\r\n\r\nmorning  peak and 16 minutes during the evening peak.  During\r\n\r\noff-peak  periods,  the  supply of  taxis  usually  outstrips\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this situation, the question is how does one meet\r\n\r\nthe demand for taxi service at different times of the day and\r\n\r\nat  different  locations in the most  optimal  and  efficient\r\n\r\nmanner.   From a business angle, it is not optimal  for  taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies to size their fleet based on peak-period demand, as\r\n\r\nthey would be having excess capacity during off-peak periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution lies in differential pricing to balance\r\n\r\nsupply  and  demand.   The  Government  has  deregulated  the\r\n\r\nsetting  of  taxi fares in September 1998 for  this  purpose.\r\n\r\nWith  deregulated taxi fares, taxi companies  are  given  the\r\n\r\nfull  flexibility to adjust their fares in response to demand\r\n\r\npatterns and changes in ERP pricing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of taxi shortage in the CBD is best\r\n\r\naddressed by the taxi companies, through fare adjustments  so\r\n\r\nthat taxi drivers will have the necessary incentives to enter\r\n\r\nthe  CBD  during the evening peak period.  Market pricing  of\r\n\r\ntaxi services is the most effective way to balance supply and\r\n\r\ndemand throughout the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If commuters in the CBD find the wait for a taxi during\r\n\r\npeak periods to be too long, they can choose from a range  of\r\n\r\ntaxi  booking services.  These charge a premium according  to\r\n\r\nthe  service level offered, including response time  and  the\r\n\r\ncertainty in obtaining a taxi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
