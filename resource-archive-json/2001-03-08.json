Mr  Leong\r\n\r\nHorn Kee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I shall take\r\n\r\nyour  point that we should make our speeches short and sharp.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the\r\n\r\nMain Estimates be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I go into speaking on my cut on the impact\r\n\r\nof  regional  developments, I am compelled to  actually  make\r\n\r\nsome  remarks  on some reports made in the press  today.   In\r\n\r\nparticular, I would like to refer you, Sir, to the commentary\r\n\r\nby  a  certain reporter that yesterday there was so much time\r\n\r\nbut  so few questions.  In fact, the reporter went on to  say\r\n\r\nthat  with  the  Budget debate on, there had  been  only  two\r\n\r\nqueries  for  oral answers each day and not by  elected  MPs.\r\n\r\nThat did not sound very fair.  She went on to say that we had\r\n\r\nextended Question Time by half an hour purposely to give more\r\n\r\ntime for Q&A and why the MPs, especially elected MPs, did not\r\n\r\nuse the time to ask questions.  And she said that rather than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelected MPs, Nominated MPs and NCMP had used the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that this is unfair because it shows she\r\n\r\nhas  no clear understanding of our parliamentary process.   I\r\n\r\nam  also  disappointed that this particular reporter actually\r\n\r\nhad  spent  many years in the Gallery, looking at  us  making\r\n\r\nspeeches,  and  should know the procedures of the  Government\r\n\r\nand  parliamentary process here.  In fact, Question  Time  is\r\n\r\nonly  used  during  normal Parliament sittings.   During  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  Supply, MPs actually spend their  time  asking\r\n\r\nmany detailed questions.  The fact that we have extended  the\r\n\r\nsittings  to  61/4  hours  every day  is  testimony  that  we\r\n\r\nactually  spend a lot of time asking questions.  As you  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  Sir, there are a total of 484 amendments being  filed,\r\n\r\nand  each  amendment  can  be a multiplicity  of  many  other\r\n\r\nquestions  in  those topics.  So we could easily  have  asked\r\n\r\nthousands of questions within these few days of sittings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reporter also asked why the number of speakers also\r\n\r\nwent  down and it seems to be a very important fact, from  25\r\n\r\nto  13  yesterday.  This again shows that she  has  no  clear\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  our process.  MPs speak according  to  the\r\n\r\ntime  that they feel they should make clear and good  points,\r\n\r\nnot  by the length of time they speak.  On the final day,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  give  the  Minister time for him  to  give  a  very\r\n\r\ndetailed  reply.  Therefore, more time is spent and given  on\r\n\r\nthe first day for MPs to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a final remark. In a sense, I am disappointed\r\n\r\nthat  somehow  the recent press coverage of our parliamentary\r\n\r\nprocess  seems  to be taking a line on focusing  on  the  MPs\r\n\r\nthemselves,  instead of the issues and topics for discussion.\r\n\r\nIt  seems to also lack, in my own words, in-depth analysis of\r\n\r\nour  process.  We should actually look at issues being raised\r\n\r\nand  how the Minister answers them, rather than say which  MP\r\n\r\nasks  which particular question, how many times he  has  been\r\n\r\nfeatured in the coverage, and, in their points, counting  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  times the MP has been mentioned.  These  are  not\r\n\r\nvery fair assessments of an MP's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperformance because he has worked on the ground.  Even if the\r\n\r\nMP  spends  little  time, he makes quality  comments  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate.   I  think, on the other hand, the press should  also\r\n\r\ntake  note  of  what they are doing, and  not  focus  on  MPs\r\n\r\nthemselves, but on the topics we are discussing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I go on the topic of the first cut which is the\r\n\r\nimpact of regional developments.  Sir, the Economic Survey of\r\n\r\nSingapore 2000 reported that Singapore's trade with  Malaysia\r\n\r\nsurged  by  37%  in Year 2000.  For the first time,  Malaysia\r\n\r\novertook  the  USA as the top trading partner  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nOur trade with Malaysia amounted to S$82.6 billion, nearly 9%\r\n\r\nhigher  than  the  total trade of S$75.9  billion  with  USA.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, although we do not publish our trade figures  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  it  is understood that our trade  with  Indonesia\r\n\r\nused to be very substantial.  I do not know whether the trade\r\n\r\nvolume  with  Indonesia has dropped since the  political  and\r\n\r\nfinancial turmoil in that country, but I would think that the\r\n\r\ntrade volume should remain significant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, we have to accept that any adverse\r\n\r\npolitical  or  economic  developments in  these  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries will have an impact on Singapore.  In fact, DPM  BG\r\n\r\nLee  Hsien  Loong has recently said that this is one  of  the\r\n\r\nmost difficult and uncertain times in this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sharp rise in the bilateral trade with Malaysia was\r\n\r\ndue  to  a  few factors.  One was the increase in Singapore's\r\n\r\nForeign Direct Investment (FDI) to Malaysia.  The second  was\r\n\r\nthe  upturn in the global electronics market which led  to  a\r\n\r\nmore  re-export  of  electronic parts and components  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia; and the third reason was the increase\r\n\r\nin  oil  exports.   This  growth of bilateral  trade  between\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  Malaysia  clearly  demonstrates  the   close\r\n\r\nintertwining of the two economies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the regional crisis, Singapore was pushing for\r\n\r\nthe Growth Triangle and for the promotion of the location  of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing facilities by Singapore based\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies and MNCs to the neighbouring countries and regions,\r\n\r\nlike  Batam and Bintan.  Therefore, similarly, we  also  have\r\n\r\nclose ties with our other neighbour, Indonesia.  Hence, I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned   about  the  economic  and  political  events   in\r\n\r\nIndonesia and Malaysia.  The Minister for Trade and  Industry\r\n\r\nrecently  visited Indonesia, and he also must  have  been  in\r\n\r\nclose touch with the developments in Malaysia.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould very much appreciate to hear from the Minister what are\r\n\r\nhis  views  on the possible scenarios unfolding in  Indonesia\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia.  If there were to be adverse developments, how\r\n\r\ncould   Singapore  cushion  ourselves  against  the  negative\r\n\r\nimpact?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move on to my second cut? On Free Trade\r\n\r\nAgreements, while maintaining close ties with our neighbours,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has embarked on a bold initiative to leapfrog  the\r\n\r\nregion  by establishing closer trade and investment  linkages\r\n\r\nwith  the stable developed economies further away.   This  is\r\n\r\nachieved   by  signing  Free  Trade  Agreements  with   other\r\n\r\ncountries outside ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has inked an FTA with New Zealand, and is in\r\n\r\ndiscussion  with  USA, Australia, Canada, Mexico,  Japan  and\r\n\r\nChile on FTAs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These FTAs will bring about substantial benefits. For\r\n\r\nexample, if we can sign an FTA with the USA, it would attract\r\n\r\nmore  foreign  investments from MNCs eyeing  the  US  market.\r\n\r\nThis  benefit is clearly seen in Mexico, which  has  a  North\r\n\r\nAmerican Free Trade Area (NAFTA) with the USA and Canada.  It\r\n\r\nwas  reported in the Business Week magazine, in its 5th March\r\n\r\nissue, that with the widened horizons, Singapore's FTAs could\r\n\r\nbring the following advantages:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Reduce the nation's reliance on its neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Lower tariffs and attract foreign manufacturers to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Spur our neighbours to get back on the free-trade\r\n\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Help boost global confidence in the rest of the\r\n\r\nregion in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these meaningful and real benefits, I was indeed\r\n\r\nsurprised  to read in recent press reports that  top  leaders\r\n\r\nfrom   both  Malaysia  and  Indonesia  were  concerned  about\r\n\r\nSingapore's  unilateral free trade agreements with  non-ASEAN\r\n\r\nmembers.   For  example,  Indonesian  President,  Abdurrahman\r\n\r\nWahid, was reported to have said that he wanted Singapore  to\r\n\r\nhelp  first  restore Indonesia's economy, and not search  for\r\n\r\nnew trade partners far afield.  The Malaysian Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nDr  Mahathir,  was reported to have remarked that  such  FTAs\r\n\r\nwere a \"worrisome\" development affecting the ASEAN Free Trade\r\n\r\nArea (AFTA).  He was bothered by the non-ASEAN countries that\r\n\r\nmay  use  the FTAs as a \"backdoor\" to enter AFTA, by shipping\r\n\r\npartly  completed products into Singapore and  complete  them\r\n\r\nhere  so  that  these products can be regarded as  Singapore-made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am rather baffled by these contrasting comments\r\n\r\nof  the  Business  Week magazine, analysing the  benefits  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's FTAs with the surrounding countries in the  other\r\n\r\nparts of the world, against the resentments expressed by  the\r\n\r\ntwo  closest neighbours.  Perhaps, the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry could enlighten this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, we have been informed\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister  for Trade and Industry that  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnegotiating  free  trade  agreements with  Australia,  Japan,\r\n\r\nMexico and the United States, with the aim of concluding them\r\n\r\nby  the end of the year.  We have also been informed that  we\r\n\r\nare  also  in exploratory talks with Canada and the  European\r\n\r\nFree Trade Area.  Our first bilateral FTA was signed with New\r\n\r\nZealand in 1999.  These are important developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking as Chairman of the Government Parliamentary\r\n\r\nCommittee for Manpower, and a union official, I support\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  move to establish free  trade  with  like-minded  countries, because the FTAs can help expand bilateral\r\n\r\ntrade with and two-way investments in these countries.   This\r\n\r\nmeans there could potentially be more economic activities and\r\n\r\nmore  jobs  in  our  country,  as  well  as  in  our  partner\r\n\r\ncountries.  There may not be equal benefits for two countries\r\n\r\ninvolved  in the bilateral FTAs, but there could  be  overall\r\n\r\nbenefits  for the ordinary people, as well as for businesses,\r\n\r\nas  there would be more and, hopefully, better jobs and  more\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  We must make sure that the agreements would have\r\n\r\nsufficient safeguards for the workers, businesses, as well as\r\n\r\nfor the states.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although FTAs should not be an alternative to\r\n\r\nmultilateral  trade  agreements,  they  could  prove  to   be\r\n\r\ndecisive   in   fostering   moves   towards   global    trade\r\n\r\nliberalisation  under  the WTO.  So,  the  FTA  is  a  useful\r\n\r\nmeasure  to  take  before  there  is  a  multilateral   trade\r\n\r\nagreement later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free trade agreements will not only serve to better\r\n\r\neconomic  conditions for workers and businesses in Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  also  bring  greater  international  interest  into  the\r\n\r\nmarkets  in Southeast Asia.  Being a business hub, I am  sure\r\n\r\nSingapore  would be able to attract investments and companies\r\n\r\nto  come  to Singapore and look at the business opportunities\r\n\r\nin  Southeast  Asia.   To  give  an  example,  without  clear\r\n\r\nbenefits  to itself and to the region in which it is located,\r\n\r\nI  am sure Mexico would have little interest to negotiate the\r\n\r\nFTA with us.  In fact, Mexico, which is already a part of the\r\n\r\nNorth  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), would not  have\r\n\r\nconcluded  or  negotiated FTAs with so many Latin  and  South\r\n\r\nAmerican countries like Brazil, Uruguay and Peru, as well  as\r\n\r\nwith  the  European Union and Israel.  In  fact,  Mexico  has\r\n\r\nalready  started  discussions with Japan,  which  is  another\r\n\r\ncountry with whom we are negotiating an FTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are those within our own region which fear that\r\n\r\nour pursuit of bilateral free trade agreements could lead  to\r\n\r\nmassive  inflows,  into  ASEAN, of non-ASEAN  products,  thus\r\n\r\nabusing the terms and conditions of AFTA, and diluting the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbenefits that ASEAN will gain from the full implementation of\r\n\r\nAFTA.  Ironically, we have similar voices outside ASEAN  that\r\n\r\nare  full  of  concern that competitively-priced ASEAN  goods\r\n\r\nwill   flood   their  domestic  markets  through   Singapore,\r\n\r\njeopardising their own local industries.  We have heard  this\r\n\r\nargument from some quarters in New Zealand before we signed a\r\n\r\nbilateral trade agreement with Wellington.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there seems to be a need for us to explain to our\r\n\r\nASEAN   neighbours  about  our  pursuit  of  bilateral  FTAs,\r\n\r\nparticularly to Malaysia and Indonesia, which have  expressed\r\n\r\nconcern  over the possibility of Singapore being  used  as  a\r\n\r\nbackdoor  to  gain entry into the AFTA region.  In  my  view,\r\n\r\nthis is a very short-term view of the issues at hand.  In the\r\n\r\nlong  term, bilateral free trade agreements could  act  as  a\r\n\r\nstimulus  for  an  increase of trade and  investment  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   Moreover,  it  can also accelerate  and  strengthen\r\n\r\nmultilateral trade agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\ntalk  about  the  same  issue  -  the  bilateral  free  trade\r\n\r\ninitiatives taken by Singapore - and as to how we should look\r\n\r\nat the picture in toto and encourage our neighbours to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage the Minister to consistently promote\r\n\r\nthe  idea that these bilateral free trade initiatives  really\r\n\r\nare  a  response to the stall in the World Trade Organisation\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  and a kind of competitive reinsurance  against\r\n\r\nthe  free trade initiatives happening in the Americas and  in\r\n\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, there have been limits to what the ASEAN Free\r\n\r\nTrade  Area  has done, and these have not been on Singapore's\r\n\r\npart,  but those of our neighbours.  But our goal must be  to\r\n\r\nreassure  our neighbours and bring them along, and,  in  this\r\n\r\nsense,  I  would actually disagree with the hon.  Member,  Mr\r\n\r\nLeong  Horn  Kee,  that  we should not  be  leapfrogging  the\r\n\r\nregion.  Rather, we might want to bring the region along with\r\n\r\nus; we are not leaving any one behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this sense, I am encouraging the Minister's\r\n\r\npolicy  to  be  one  of  reconfirming  our  priority  to  the\r\n\r\nmultilateral  framework,  even as  we  pursue  our  bilateral\r\n\r\ninitiatives.  We should help our neighbours to understand how\r\n\r\nwe see these connections, the links, from the bilateral level\r\n\r\nto  the  regional  level,  to the international  level,  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  pay  due attention to both the levels  below  and\r\n\r\nabove us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, I would like to ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nreassure this House and our neighbours that we would be  WTO-consistent in our approach, paying heed to Article 24 of  the\r\n\r\nGATT, and that we will try to be inventive in seeking out new\r\n\r\nareas which WTO, as yet, does not encompass, and that we will\r\n\r\nalso  try to egg on a faster pace of liberalisation, to build\r\n\r\nup momentum for the WTO round.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, was disturbed by reactions by our neighbours\r\n\r\nregarding the possibility of a backdoor, but my understanding\r\n\r\nis that we will negotiate rules of origin.  In the ASEAN Free\r\n\r\nTrade  Agreement (AFTA), it is 40% of local manufacture.   In\r\n\r\nthis sense, I would ask the Minister to confirm that this  is\r\n\r\nthe agreed front door.  There is no backdoor entrance in this\r\n\r\nsense, to AFTA.  We should not let any possible envy slow  us\r\n\r\ndown,  Sir.  But we should pause to help clear up any genuine\r\n\r\ndoubts  or misunderstandings and, if our neighbours need  our\r\n\r\nhelp, we should increase our assistance to them, to help them\r\n\r\nadjust  to  AFTA  and  to the WTO.  For  those  who  are  not\r\n\r\nmembers,  such  as  Vietnam,  we  should  encourage  them  to\r\n\r\nunderstand and cooperate with them, to help them prepare  for\r\n\r\nWTO accession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, Sir, I am asking our policy to be one of\r\n\r\ntraining  and dialogue, not just among governments, but  also\r\n\r\nthe  academics  and think-tanks, so that our  neighbours  can\r\n\r\ntake  part  with  us in moving the region  and,  indeed,  the\r\n\r\nworld, forward for more free trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, can I make a point of\r\n\r\nclarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, with your indulgence, I need to\r\n\r\nexplain  the  point  that, perhaps, Mr  Simon  Tay  has  been\r\n\r\nmistaken as to what I have said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not mean to say that Singapore should ignore the\r\n\r\nsurrounding  region  and reach out to the  countries  further\r\n\r\nafield.   If  he heard my speech more carefully,  I  actually\r\n\r\nsaid  that we should maintain close ties with our neighbours.\r\n\r\nOf  course, I used the word \"leapfrog\", to reach out  to  the\r\n\r\nother  countries  further  away.  In  the  process,  it  will\r\n\r\nactually  also  bring benefits back to this  region.   I  did\r\n\r\nmention that it would spur our neighbours to be back  on  the\r\n\r\nfree trade track and also help to boost global confidence  in\r\n\r\nthis region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, hitherto, the\r\n\r\nrole  of each business and trade body has been a logical  and\r\n\r\nuseful extension of businesses or companies belonging to  the\r\n\r\nsame   industry.   Many  such  interest  groups   have   been\r\n\r\ninstrumental  in furthering the collective goals,  frequently\r\n\r\nalong industry lines, such as organising trade delegations or\r\n\r\nrepresentation of needs to the Government.  For example,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Hotel  Association or the  Retailers'  Association\r\n\r\nwill  facilitate networking amongst members, conduct research\r\n\r\nand  surveys, and facilitate the implementation of Government\r\n\r\nschemes to help players better position themselves.  Not  too\r\n\r\ndissimilar  in intent is the Association of Small and  Medium\r\n\r\nEnterprises  or ASME, which looks after the needs  of  member\r\n\r\ncompanies across different industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This network and clustering of interests has generally\r\n\r\nworked  well but will increasingly prove inadequate  for  the\r\n\r\nglobalised  nature of the marketplace and, hence, competition\r\n\r\nthat Singapore-based businesses now face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of all market players should no longer be a\r\n\r\nSingapore-centric, but a global marketplace instead,  and  be\r\n\r\nwhere market forces are pulling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, in making the transition to a knowledge-based economy, the interests of most, if not all, industries\r\n\r\nare likely to revolve around the theme of exporting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbrainpower and software-type services of a Singapore origin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, for related industries, for which there is\r\n\r\nincreasingly  more  overlap  or  convergence,  a  pooling  of\r\n\r\ninterests will make a lot of sense, eg, between logistics and\r\n\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initiative to integrate and pool these interests\r\n\r\nunder an umbrella body is, therefore, fitting.  However, care\r\n\r\nmust  be taken to ensure that the right leadership and vision\r\n\r\nmust be in place to balance the wide range of interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister, within this framework,\r\n\r\nwhat  role  would  the  Government play  and  how  would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  help  ensure that both Singapore's  larger  macro\r\n\r\ngoals  and  the  needs  of  member companies  are  met.   For\r\n\r\nexample, what sort of role can such an umbrella body play  in\r\n\r\nthe  pursuit  of  free  trade  agreements  with  the  various\r\n\r\ncountries?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, on the formation of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business  Federation,  early  this  year,  it  was\r\n\r\nreported that the Minister for Trade and Industry, BG  George\r\n\r\nYeo,  said  that he would be moving a Bill to  recognise  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Business  Federation  as  the  new  apex  business\r\n\r\nfederation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea was that the local business sector needed a\r\n\r\nstrong  apex  organisation, like the Keidanren of  Japan,  to\r\n\r\nimprove   its   representative  prowess,  both  locally   and\r\n\r\noverseas.   The Singapore Federation of Chambers of  Commerce\r\n\r\nis  reorganising  itself into the SBF, and  a  search  for  a\r\n\r\nsuitable CEO for this new body is ongoing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the\r\n\r\nstatus  of this proposed SBF.  When would the Bill  be  ready\r\n\r\nfor  tabling  in Parliament?  Could the Minister  give  us  a\r\n\r\npreview  of  the  main elements of the Bill?   What  are  the\r\n\r\nfeatures that would ensure that the SBF would have the image,\r\n\r\nclout  and  means  to be developed as an  equivalent  to  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  Keidanren.   One way is  to  ensure  that  our  top\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  can be persuaded to serve on the board  of  this\r\n\r\nSBF, and another is to ensure that we can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nidentify a very capable and well-respected person to  be  the\r\n\r\nCEO.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do have a concern with the SBF, which is that\r\n\r\nif  the  concept is to have a law that empowers  the  SBF  to\r\n\r\nrequire  all  companies operating in Singapore  with  paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital  of more than $0.5 million to be members,  then  this\r\n\r\nmay  create  a  lot  of resentment by the smaller  companies,\r\n\r\nespecially  if they have to pay subscription by  law.   Among\r\n\r\nthe  18,800  Singapore  registered companies  which  will  be\r\n\r\nforced  to  join,  the  majority will  be  small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises.  They may not want to join because they may feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  SBF will speak only for the large firms and  their\r\n\r\ninterests  will not be represented.  Hence, to be successful,\r\n\r\nI  feel  that the framework of the SBF has to create  avenues\r\n\r\nwhereby the different firms from different groupings  and  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  sizes  can find their views and  interests  voiced\r\n\r\nadequately through this apex body.  The Minister may wish  to\r\n\r\ncomment on these concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to my next cut on entrepreneurship. Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been  ranked the world's most globalised  country  in  a\r\n\r\nrecent  survey  done  by  the respected  US  magazine  called\r\n\r\n\"Foreign  Policy\"  of 50 countries around  the  world.   This\r\n\r\nGlobalisation  Index  was  created  by  the  Foreign   Policy\r\n\r\nmagazine  and  renowned US consulting firm, AT Kearney.   The\r\n\r\nreport  said that \"Tiny Singapore clearly stands out  as  the\r\n\r\nworld's  most  global  country and it far  out-distances  its\r\n\r\nnearest   rivals,   which   are  the   Netherlands,   Sweden,\r\n\r\nSwitzerland  and  Finland which are  in  the  second,  third,\r\n\r\nfourth and fifth places respectively.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am actually very intrigued by this celebrated ranking\r\n\r\nof Singapore as the world's most globalised country by a very\r\n\r\nrespectable  agency.   No doubt, the  assessment  is  correct\r\n\r\nbased  on  the criteria like cross border flows of goods  and\r\n\r\nservices, capital, people and communications.  If  we  are  a\r\n\r\ntop  globalised  country,  then  where  are  our  top  global\r\n\r\ncompanies?  In sharp contrast with the hugely successful  and\r\n\r\nwell regarded global\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies  like  Shell, Ericsson, Swiss Bank Corporation  and\r\n\r\nNokia,  which are companies and products of the lesser ranked\r\n\r\ncompanies,  then  where are the world-class  companies  home-grown from Singapore which can match our exalted status as  a\r\n\r\nglobalised  economy?  Save for Singapore Airlines,  I  cannot\r\n\r\nthink of any other local companies that can truly be said  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  global business presence equal to that of  Shell  or\r\n\r\nNokia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do feel that enough has been done by the Government in\r\n\r\nrecent   years   in   terms  of  creating  a   pro-enterprise\r\n\r\nenvironment, such as a low tax regime, stock option  schemes,\r\n\r\naccess  to  venture  capital funds and a  conducive  business\r\n\r\nclimate.  However, what is still lacking is the insufficiency\r\n\r\nof   the  main  ingredient,  which  is  the  people  or   the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.   Having done so much  by  the  Government,  I\r\n\r\nactually  wonder why we constantly lament at  the  dearth  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs in Singapore.  Some people rationalise that the\r\n\r\nreason  could  be that Singapore is a small economy.   But  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that this excuse of small size is not a good excuse  to\r\n\r\nmake.   Let  us  take the example of Nokia.   Nokia  is  from\r\n\r\nFinland  which  has  an  economy and  population  similar  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Yet Nokia is a world-class company that  grew  by\r\n\r\nseizing  the opportunity of the world telecommunication  boom\r\n\r\nin recent years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would suggest that the Minister may consider\r\n\r\nseriously two other factors that may affect the growth of our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship environment in Singapore and the  number  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs that we can nurture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First is the effect of the crowding out of the private\r\n\r\nsector by the Government-linked companies (GLCs).  Second  is\r\n\r\nthe  deprivation of a pool of the brighter and talented young\r\n\r\npeople to join the private enterprises, as the Government and\r\n\r\nthe  GLCs and the statutory boards have been giving out large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  scholarships  to  capture  our  brightest  young\r\n\r\nstudents  and bond them to work in the Government service  or\r\n\r\nin GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these are valid reasons, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether the Government should consider hastening the\r\n\r\nprocess  of divestment of the GLCs and liberalise the concept\r\n\r\nof  imposition of bonds on our students.  Perhaps, it is time\r\n\r\nfor us to take a more enlightened approach on bonds.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  suggest  that for some of these  bonds,  we  should\r\n\r\nrequire  our  scholarship students to return to Singapore  to\r\n\r\nwork  as the only requirement for bondage, rather than to  be\r\n\r\nbonded to a particular company in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Minister concur with this evaluation? Let us\r\n\r\nhear  his  comments.  However, not having enough  world-class\r\n\r\ncompanies  now  does  not mean that we should  not  start  to\r\n\r\ncultivate and nurture promising local companies to grow  into\r\n\r\nworld-class   ones.   The  process  would   take   time   and\r\n\r\nsubstantial effort.  For a start, we need to create a  larger\r\n\r\npool  of entrepreneurs running sizeable companies. They  must\r\n\r\nbe  prepared  to take risks and venture out.   They  must  be\r\n\r\ntolerant  to  failures and we must create an  environment  of\r\n\r\nenterprise, with ample rewards for those who succeed.   Local\r\n\r\ncompanies should be encouraged to merge so as to create  bulk\r\n\r\nand compete more effectively against foreign enterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, in the Budget\r\n\r\ndebate  a  few days ago, I spoke about the need to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  entrepreneurship drive in Singapore because of the  drop\r\n\r\nof  confidence among entrepreneurs and investors.  While  the\r\n\r\nmany  companies  started  by many  young  entrepreneurs  have\r\n\r\nfailed  in the past one year or so, there are many  more  who\r\n\r\nare  willing  to try, but the environment has  changed  quite\r\n\r\ndrastically  to  one of conservatism and, therefore,  to  one\r\n\r\nthat  is  quite detrimental towards our efforts to  promoting\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship. The trend that I have seen recently is that\r\n\r\nthis time, we are seeing not just the young Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  trying their hand at being entrepreneurs, but also  many\r\n\r\nmore  experienced and older Singaporeans who have many  years\r\n\r\nof  working  experience and domain knowledge who are  leading\r\n\r\nthe charge in the next wave of start-ups.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThese  \"gray-haired\" entrepreneurs, as I  call  them,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, have a much higher chance to succeed as they partner\r\n\r\nwith  the  younger people who bring technology to the  table.\r\n\r\nIt  is  a very encouraging sign and we should support it.   I\r\n\r\nhave the following issues to raise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, when NSTB launched the US$1 billion fund which\r\n\r\nwas  used to co-invest mainly with foreign VCs, there  was  a\r\n\r\nrequirement  that only about 30% of the fund was required  to\r\n\r\nbe  invested  locally.  Many foreign VCs therefore  took  the\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  this  scheme and used the  funds  for  foreign\r\n\r\nprojects and investments.  I therefore suggest that, first of\r\n\r\nall,  we  should tighten the 30% requirement so that more  of\r\n\r\nthe  funds  must be invested locally.  We should require  the\r\n\r\nVCs  which benefited from the funding to invest the  majority\r\n\r\nof  their  funds in Singapore projects.  Secondly, allow  the\r\n\r\nfunds to be invested not just in high-tech, but also low-tech\r\n\r\nprojects,  as long as we promote entrepreneurship.   What  we\r\n\r\nreally want is to develop the entrepreneurship culture and it\r\n\r\ndoes  not matter what the content is. Thirdly, there is  talk\r\n\r\nabout  the next $1 billion that the Government is willing  to\r\n\r\nput aside and I suggest that we should do it differently this\r\n\r\ntime   by   giving  the  fund  to  local  entrepreneurs   and\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  to  manage  the funds  directly  as  a  national\r\n\r\nservice.   I  am  confident we have many  capable  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore who will be willing to do this service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the Budget debate, I also spoke about the\r\n\r\nsudden tightening of the funding situation.   While we cannot\r\n\r\nforce  banks  or VCs to fund start-ups, we should  set  up  a\r\n\r\nLifeline Fund to help promising companies that are in trouble\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  over  conservatism  environment  after  the\r\n\r\ndot.com  bust.  We  risk  losing good  companies  and  people\r\n\r\nbecause  they lack funding.  The Technopreneurship 21 Private\r\n\r\nSector Committee suggested this sometime last year and I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  will  seriously consider  this  request.   The\r\n\r\nproposal is as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to set aside $20-$30 million to fund 50 to 60\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this fund can be jointly administered with a\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  entity, for example, the T21 Private  Sector\r\n\r\nCommittee or any other private entity, that Government  wants\r\n\r\nto identify.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, use this money to co-invest with private sector\r\n\r\nfunds  or  individuals so that we can lighten the  burden  of\r\n\r\nthose who try to save these companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, this needs to be administered quickly and\r\n\r\nspeed  is  very  important  because  there  are  still   many\r\n\r\ncompanies  at  the  brink  of  collapse   and  therefore  the\r\n\r\ncriteria requirements for investment need to be simple.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, the Lifeline Fund can take a reasonable equity\r\n\r\nin  lieu  of  the  life-saving investment.  Even  if  only  a\r\n\r\nhandful of companies make it, I am confident that the $20-$30\r\n\r\nmillion  will  be  multiplied many more times  and  ensure  a\r\n\r\ngenerous return for the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the goodwill created by the Government will go\r\n\r\na  long  way  in improving the environment and in encouraging\r\n\r\nothers to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently heard about the Prince Charles Fund in the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, where the prince set aside a certain fund  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  projects and start-ups which failed to  find  any\r\n\r\ninterested  investors or VCs.  The main  criterion  for  this\r\n\r\nfund is that the person or persons seeking the fund from  the\r\n\r\nPrince Charles Fund must truly have exhausted all channels of\r\n\r\nfunding before the fund is disbursed to them. We might  think\r\n\r\nthat  this is a kind of charity and is doomed to go bankrupt.\r\n\r\nBut  from what I understand, the fund is actually growing and\r\n\r\nhas  an  annual  Internal Rate of Return of about  15%.   The\r\n\r\nprinciple is the same for the Lifeline Fund.  All we need are\r\n\r\nsome winners for handsome returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should aggressively privatise the NSTB, EDB and\r\n\r\nPSB   roles  that  duplicate  the  private  sector  type   of\r\n\r\nactivities.  In fact, all of these agencies, over the  years,\r\n\r\nhave  taken  on activities that just duplicate  many  private\r\n\r\nsector activities, for example, funding, consulting, training\r\n\r\nand so on.  We should consider forming consortiums\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsisting  of  private sector players who  can  manage  such\r\n\r\nactivities rather than just corporatise these entities  which\r\n\r\nI think is the current Government's immediate plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to resolve the serious problems seen by the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  HDB businesses is to allow the HDB  shophouses\r\n\r\nto   be   used   for  technology  start-ups  in   the   info-communications, light and non-polluting type  of  industries.\r\n\r\nThis will make the neighbourhood more vibrant.  It will allow\r\n\r\ngood  use of the HDB shophouses and for the current shophouse\r\n\r\nowners  to  exit their businesses by leasing or  selling  the\r\n\r\nshop  to  start-up companies.  It immediately  increases  the\r\n\r\navailability   of  commercial  and  industrial   space   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, this will reduce costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point I want to make on entrepreneurship is\r\n\r\nthe  Buona Vista Science  Hub.  From what I understand, there\r\n\r\nare  plans  for  JTC  to create the Silicon  Valley  type  of\r\n\r\nenvironment.   I  do not see how JTC can manage  two  systems\r\n\r\nunder  the  same  management.  I therefore suggest  that  JTC\r\n\r\nleases  the  Hub  to a truly private sector  organisation  to\r\n\r\nmanage  it  and leave them to create that kind of environment\r\n\r\nthat we want to create.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have also been problems seen by many talented\r\n\r\npeople  that  we  want to bring into Singapore,  in  bringing\r\n\r\ntheir   families   down   here.   The   current   immigration\r\n\r\nregulations  are  still  restrictive  especially  for  family\r\n\r\nmembers  and  I  hope that the Minister  can  work  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower to make this easier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point on entrepreneurship is the 60-plus\r\n\r\nincentive schemes that the Minister for Finance talked  about\r\n\r\nrecently.  The current issue is that these are just too  many\r\n\r\nand  too confusing, especially for start-ups as well  as  for\r\n\r\nthe  smaller  companies to comprehend and to  get  around  to\r\n\r\napply this incentive successfully.  Many of them just give up\r\n\r\napplying and are therefore unable to benefit from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  scheme.   I  suggest that we take  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nrationalise  this  to  just a few  schemes  that  are  easily\r\n\r\nmanageable, easily understandable by everyone and that can be\r\n\r\nmore  effective  in  trying to promote  entrepreneurship  and\r\n\r\nstart-ups in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, with the collapse of the dot-com phenomenon in the US, we are seeing more and more dot-com\r\n\r\nor  e-commerce companies collapsing and falling by  the  way-side.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is equally affected by this dot-com downturn.\r\n\r\nHowever,  from  my contacts with the e-commerce  or  Internet\r\n\r\ncommunity,  I  feel that there are some fairly good  start-up\r\n\r\ncompanies with good management and sound product ideas  which\r\n\r\nwould  be  worthwhile to rescue.  However, due to a  lack  of\r\n\r\nfunding  which  dried  up suddenly, these  potentially  sound\r\n\r\ncompanies  can  be  starved of funding  and  could  therefore\r\n\r\nfinally collapse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like my GPC colleague, Mr Inderjit Singh, I feel that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  can establish a Start-up  Lifeline  Fund  to\r\n\r\nassist  these  companies.  The idea can be  based  on  a  co-funding  manner where the Government can work  together  with\r\n\r\nsome  selected  experienced and capable venture  capital  and\r\n\r\nmanagement companies to seek out and support promising  local\r\n\r\ncompanies  to get through the current difficult market.   The\r\n\r\ngeneral  concept can be that of a Lifeline Fund that can  co-invest into local companies on a dollar for dollar basis with\r\n\r\nthe  private sector funding.  This way, some promising  local\r\n\r\nstart-up  companies  can  be assisted  to  pull  through  the\r\n\r\npresent difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The details of the scheme can be worked out with some of\r\n\r\nthese  industry professionals and need not be discussed here,\r\n\r\nprovided that the Government can agree and support this  idea\r\n\r\nthrough a pledge of a certain sum of money, say, to create  a\r\n\r\nfund  of  $50  million which is to be matched by another  $50\r\n\r\nmillion  from  the private sector, making  a  total  of  $100\r\n\r\nmillion.   This  $100 million fund can therefore  be  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant   lifeline  for  many  of  our   smaller   start-up\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have spoken about the\r\n\r\nLifeline Fund.  I will move on to the next cut on the  retail\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the retail sector of the economy has had prolonged\r\n\r\nstructured  problems  which,  up  to  now,  have   not   been\r\n\r\neffectively resolved.  There are many people engaged in  this\r\n\r\nsector,  employing a significant proportion of our workforce.\r\n\r\nData  show that this sector is the most unproductive in terms\r\n\r\nof   value  added  per  worker,  as  compared  to  the  other\r\n\r\nindustries  in Singapore.  For example, the value  added  per\r\n\r\nworker  for the manufacturing sector in 1998 was $84,000,  as\r\n\r\ncompared to $26,500 for the retail sector.  The retail sector\r\n\r\nwas  therefore the worst among all sectors, even  worse  than\r\n\r\nthe  construction sector in terms of productivity per worker.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, if we compare the productivity and value added  per\r\n\r\nworker  of  Singapore  retailers with  many  other  developed\r\n\r\ncountries,  we  are performing quite badly, worse  than  most\r\n\r\nEuropean and western countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Productivity and Standards Board\r\n\r\ncommissioned  a  study called Retail 21, of  which  I  was  a\r\n\r\nmember,  in an attempt to define strategies for the  industry\r\n\r\nin this new millennium, and this was launched yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of their findings, I would like to highlight\r\n\r\na  few  critical areas that should be looked into.   Firstly,\r\n\r\nwith  regional shopping centres and neighbourhood malls,  HDB\r\n\r\nshophouses are losing substantial business to the point  that\r\n\r\nthey  are no longer viable as businesses.  This, coupled with\r\n\r\nchanging lifestyle of Singaporeans who prefer to go to  large\r\n\r\nsupermarkets and shopping centres, signals a time for  us  to\r\n\r\nmake  decisive changes to the retail sector.  The  Government\r\n\r\nshould devise a scheme for such HDB shopowners to exit easily\r\n\r\nfrom their trade without a major financial impact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should allow a greater flexibility of use\r\n\r\nof  such shophouse space, including allowance for such spaces\r\n\r\nto  be  used  for  the  type of infocomm  industries  that  I\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier.  We should no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlonger  prolong the pain of the people stuck in these trades,\r\n\r\nespecially the HDB shophouse owner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have not been successful in promoting retail\r\n\r\non the Internet due to a number of reasons, including payment\r\n\r\nsecurity, efficiency of our logistics system and the lack  of\r\n\r\ndomain  knowledge for those who have started doing e-tailing.\r\n\r\nWe need the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a proper strategy including bringing in\r\n\r\ninternational expertise to jump start the process;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) we need to put in place a better on-line payment\r\n\r\nservice system that is trusted by everyone;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) we should take the opportunity to promote Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  regional or Asian e-shopping hub, taking advantage  of\r\n\r\nour expertise in handling logistics in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fourthly, professionalism in the retail industry\r\n\r\nneeds to be stepped up so that the value added per worker can\r\n\r\nkeep  pace with other industries, and this can then  free  up\r\n\r\nworkers for other industries which constantly face a shortage\r\n\r\nof manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, regionalisation of the retail sector can be\r\n\r\ngiven  another  boost.  I believe some of our  retailers  did\r\n\r\nattempt to go to the region and they basically lost a lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney  because  of the Asian financial crisis.   However,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  give up the opportunities to take  advantage  of\r\n\r\nfuture boom in the region or around the world.  We need a few\r\n\r\nhome-grown  Isetans  or  Wall Marts  which  can  successfully\r\n\r\ncompete  in  the region or in the world.  Can the  Government\r\n\r\ndevise proper incentives and support for this to happen fast?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, while we try to help the industry through\r\n\r\nincentive schemes, I feel that these schemes should be market\r\n\r\ndriven  rather  than  subsidies that may solve  a  short-term\r\n\r\nproblem while creating long-term inefficiencies.  We need  to\r\n\r\nmove  away from the subsidy mentality that I spoke  about  at\r\n\r\nthe Budget debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  believe  that  such  an  approach just  hides  fundamental\r\n\r\nweaknesses  of  companies.  And we have  seen  whenever  many\r\n\r\ncompanies  run  into  problems, they  actually  come  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for subsidies or handouts, and I think this is not\r\n\r\nhealthy  because  we will be competing with companies  around\r\n\r\nthe  world,  which basically operate based on market  forces.\r\n\r\nIf  we  continue to hand out subsidies, I think we will  just\r\n\r\nweaken them, and not strengthen them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the retail sector has been\r\n\r\nexperiencing  poor business for several years now.   Although\r\n\r\nthere  was  a 7.8% increase in the total sales volume,  after\r\n\r\nexcluding  unusually high motor vehicle  sales  in  the  year\r\n\r\n2000, most retailers are still finding business difficulties.\r\n\r\nThis  has  prompted the Government to draw up the  Retail  21\r\n\r\nPlan, which was announced yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the retail business in HDB estates\r\n\r\nhas  been poor in the last few years.  This is aggravated  by\r\n\r\nthe  fact that some years ago, under the HDB's Sale of  Shops\r\n\r\nprogramme, many shopkeepers had bought their shops  from  the\r\n\r\nHDB  at  market  prices then.  Even though  the  prices  were\r\n\r\ndiscounted  from market rates, some are finding  difficulties\r\n\r\nin  servicing  their bank loans.  In the face  of  continuing\r\n\r\npoor  business, I would like to ask the Minister to work with\r\n\r\nhis  colleague,  the  Minister for National  Development,  in\r\n\r\ndevising  methods  for assisting the retailers,  hawkers  and\r\n\r\nstallholders.   Both  Ministers  may  wish  to  consider  the\r\n\r\nfollowing suggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) In HDB wet markets and food courts where the\r\n\r\nbusiness   is   poor   and  the  stallholders   are   finding\r\n\r\ndifficulties   to  sustain  their  business,   the   relevant\r\n\r\nauthority   should  consider  reducing  the  rentals.    Such\r\n\r\ndownward adjustment of rentals should be undertaken speedily,\r\n\r\nrather  than  after numerous appeals.  This will also  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the stallholders will have a chance to survive  with  a\r\n\r\nlower  rental  cost.  A case in point I have is  in  the  new\r\n\r\nShunfu Mart, a wet market-cum-food\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncourt  in  my constituency.  Business has been poor from  day\r\n\r\none  since this new centre was opened last year, but the  HDB\r\n\r\nhas  not  yet  agreed to any rental reductions  despite  many\r\n\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Sir, I wish to ask the two Ministers to be flexible\r\n\r\nin  the applications of change of use of premises in the case\r\n\r\nof  privately owned shops or retail outlets.  Another example\r\n\r\nI have in my constituency is the private old shophouses along\r\n\r\nUpper  Thomson Road.  Business has been bad for some of these\r\n\r\nshophouses  for  several years.  Commercial activities,  like\r\n\r\nshops and restaurants, have been allowed on the first storey,\r\n\r\nbut the authorities have not allowed commercial activities on\r\n\r\nthe  second  storey but insisted on its use  as  residential.\r\n\r\nRepeated  appeals  to  the authorities to  allow  the  second\r\n\r\nstorey  for  commercial  purposes, such  as  restaurants  and\r\n\r\noffices, like what Mr Inderjit Singh brought up, for  dot.com\r\n\r\ncompanies have been turned down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stated reason given was that the proposed commercial\r\n\r\nuses  would \"likely aggravate the traffic and illegal parking\r\n\r\nproblems in the area.\"   Sir, the stated reason given is  not\r\n\r\nreasonable.   The  shopkeepers feel that certain  alternative\r\n\r\nuses  of  the premises would help to bring in new businesses.\r\n\r\nWhy  would  the  authorities reject the applications  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis of concern of traffic?  Having higher traffic is a good\r\n\r\nsign.   It  means  that the intended use is viable  and  will\r\n\r\ngenerate more economic activity.  As there are other means to\r\n\r\nresolve  the traffic problem, we should not curtail  a  sound\r\n\r\nand  viable business idea just because of the fear of traffic\r\n\r\ncongestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a good example where freedom to operate and choice\r\n\r\nhas  worked very well is the popular Holland Village.  It has\r\n\r\na  very  vibrant and lively eating and shopping locality.   I\r\n\r\nnotice  that  new shops or outlets constantly sprout  out  in\r\n\r\nthis  area.   When  the business is not  sustainable,  it  is\r\n\r\nquickly   replaced  by  another.   It  is  this  ability   to\r\n\r\nconstantly  adjust and change that enables  the  locality  to\r\n\r\nremain  so  vibrant.   Hence, in both  the  HDB  and  private\r\n\r\nshopping and retail areas, I would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest that the Government should actually let  the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers decide what is best suited for the area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister give us his views?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, last year, the Minister talked\r\n\r\nabout  creating many more world-class companies in  the  next\r\n\r\nfew  years.   I  have  the  following  questions.   Have   we\r\n\r\nidentified  the  right strategies and put in place   workable\r\n\r\ncriteria in selecting and grooming such companies?   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister what  is the progress so far for the\r\n\r\ntarget  which we set last year, namely, to create  a  hundred\r\n\r\nworld-class companies in a five-year time frame.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I have on world-class companies is that\r\n\r\ntoo  many  of  our research institutes (RIs)  are  Government\r\n\r\ncontrolled   and  Government  driven.   We  should   consider\r\n\r\noutsourcing this to the private sector.   The private  sector\r\n\r\nindustry  players can form permanent groupings  according  to\r\n\r\ntheir  industries and get some Government funding  to  manage\r\n\r\nthis.  The pace at which these RIs can then progress will  be\r\n\r\nmuch  faster and much in line with what is happening in other\r\n\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that we need a new Government agency\r\n\r\nto  do  the  reverse  role, if we really  want  to  focus  on\r\n\r\ndeveloping  Singapore-based multi-nationals.  While  EDB  has\r\n\r\ndone  an excellent job in bringing in foreign companies  into\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and while NSTB and the PSB have helped  many  new\r\n\r\ncompanies  to start up and grow to a reasonable  size  within\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  do  not  have any  agency  that  focuses  and\r\n\r\nfacilitates  the globalisation of our companies.   The  Trade\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board   has   done   an   excellent   job    in\r\n\r\ninternationalising our trading activities and in linking  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  with  businesses from  around  the  world.   They,\r\n\r\nhowever,  are  not chartered to groom and support  home-grown\r\n\r\nmulti-nationals,  especially in the areas  of  manufacturing,\r\n\r\nengineering, construction and others.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one very useful role for the GLCs to play is to\r\n\r\nbasically act as big brothers in bringing our SMEs with  them\r\n\r\nwhen  the GLCs globalise or do international projects.   This\r\n\r\nis  the  reverse  of  the Local Industry Upgrading  Programme\r\n\r\n(LIUP) where we give incentives to multi-nationals and  large\r\n\r\ncompanies  based in Singapore to help groom and upgrade  SMEs\r\n\r\nin  their  Singapore  operations.   This  practice  of  large\r\n\r\nnational  companies  bringing  along  smaller  companies  for\r\n\r\ninternational projects is prevalent in Japan and  in  France.\r\n\r\nSo, if we can do something that is the reverse of the LIUP to\r\n\r\nallow  our Singapore large companies to bring SMEs with them,\r\n\r\nI  think this will be very useful in trying to groom some  of\r\n\r\nthe world-class companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that many of our SMEs are not going to be\r\n\r\nviable  in  the long run, even if they are surviving  in  the\r\n\r\nshort  term.   For  such companies, it may  be  necessary  to\r\n\r\nconsider  giving them incentives to encourage them  to  merge\r\n\r\nand   consolidate   among  themselves.   Collectively,   such\r\n\r\ncompanies  may  have a better chance of becoming  world-class\r\n\r\ncompanies, while on their own many may not even survive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to encourage value creation activities for\r\n\r\ncompanies  based in Singapore.  The Government  may  want  to\r\n\r\nconsider giving incentives to companies to facilitate them to\r\n\r\nbreak  up  their  value chains and move the  less  productive\r\n\r\nactivities  of  the  companies to outside Singapore,  to  the\r\n\r\nregion, where these activities can be done more productively.\r\n\r\nI spoke about this in the Budget debate.  I hope the Minister\r\n\r\ncan give an answer to this.  In this way, we will be able  to\r\n\r\nensure  that companies will continuously climb in  the  value\r\n\r\nchain of activities in line with what our economy needs,  and\r\n\r\ncan support in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I also talked about incentives to promote\r\n\r\nproductivity improvements within our manufacturing companies.\r\n\r\nI  hope that the Minister will consider schemes, not just tax\r\n\r\nincentives,  that directly promote productivity  improvements\r\n\r\nand in this way, we can continue\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  keep Singapore as a manufacturing hub for a long time  to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, can I take all my\r\n\r\nthree cuts?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> First, on widening SME criteria.\r\n\r\nIt  is an acknowledged fact that SMEs are critical pillars of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  economy.  Nine out of  10  establishments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today are SMEs.  They employ half of our workforce\r\n\r\nand generate one-third of our total value added.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to note that the Senior Minister of\r\n\r\nState for Trade and Industry, Mr Peter Chen's reiteration  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government's commitment to SME 21, during the launch  of\r\n\r\nthe  SME  March  earlier  this week.  However,  an  important\r\n\r\nfactor, which I feel was not adequately addressed in the  SME\r\n\r\n21  blueprint launched in January last year, is the  widening\r\n\r\nof  the SME criteria.  SMEs, under the existing criteria, are\r\n\r\ndefined  as  companies with at least 30% local  equity,  have\r\n\r\nless  than  $15  million in productive asset  investment  for\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  companies  and,  additionally,  have  a  staff\r\n\r\nstrength of not more than 200, if they are in commerce or  in\r\n\r\nthe service sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These criteria, I believe, have been in force since 1988\r\n\r\nunder  the 1988 SME  Master Plan, and therefore may no longer\r\n\r\nbe  relevant in the context of our current transition into  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.  The business landscape has  changed\r\n\r\nquite  dramatically  since  1998 and  now  includes  a  wider\r\n\r\nspectrum   of   SMEs,  such  as  dot-coms  and  biotechnology\r\n\r\ncompanies which are knowledge and skill intensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional brick and mortar companies are also\r\n\r\nrestructuring and incorporating new economy features, such as\r\n\r\ne-commerce   into  their  operations.   Such  companies   may\r\n\r\nslightly  fall outside the current eligibility  criteria  for\r\n\r\nassistance,  but  yet they are in need of  help  during  this\r\n\r\nperiod  of  transition.   Also,  as  a  consequence  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattract  technology  intensive and knowledge  companies  into\r\n\r\nSingapore, more small foreign SMEs are coming to Singapore to\r\n\r\nset   up   operations  here.   Such  companies  also  deserve\r\n\r\nassistance,  but  are  denied such  because  of  the  present\r\n\r\ncriteria.   As  such,  I would like to ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider redefining and broadening the definition of SMEs  to\r\n\r\naccommodate  the  changes over the last  decade  or  so  and,\r\n\r\nparticularly, take into account SMEs' needs in the knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new definition should also include factors such as\r\n\r\nsales  volume, paid up capital, ownership and other desirable\r\n\r\nfactors,  as  done in other developed countries.   This  will\r\n\r\nenable a broader range of SMEs, including small foreign-owned\r\n\r\nones,  to take advantage of Government assistance schemes  to\r\n\r\nhelp propel the growth of SMEs operating in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is research on SMEs. While I applaud the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  rigorous  and sincere  effort  to  nurture  and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the SME sector with massive plans and programmes,\r\n\r\nas outlined in the SME 21 document, I am concerned that there\r\n\r\nare  very  few formal studies being done about our  SMEs.   I\r\n\r\nmust declare that I have a vested interest here in that I  am\r\n\r\npersonally doing research on SMEs.  In my endeavour  to  look\r\n\r\nup  past  studies done on our SMEs, I have found very  little\r\n\r\ninformation, particularly academic material, available  about\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the increasing importance attached to our\r\n\r\nSMEs,  I  would  like to urge the Minister  to  consider  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of a formal division within MTI, or through  PSB,\r\n\r\nto  study  our  SMEs.  I suggest that key  issues  afflicting\r\n\r\nthem, such as their changing needs in our transitory state of\r\n\r\nevolving  into  a  knowledge-based  economy,  challenges  and\r\n\r\ndifficulties   facing  them,  effectiveness   of   Government\r\n\r\nassistance  programmes rendered to SMEs and their performance\r\n\r\nshould be studied.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The studies should be broken down into key SME sectors,\r\n\r\nso as to understand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe different needs of and impact on our SMEs in a constantly\r\n\r\nchanging business environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the relevant faculties of our universities\r\n\r\nand  other  institutes  of  higher learning  should  also  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to undertake in-depth academic research on various\r\n\r\nissues  concerning  Singapore SMEs, while drawing  references\r\n\r\nand  comparisons  to  SMEs  from  other  NIEs  and  developed\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year the Government sets aside hundreds of millions\r\n\r\nof  dollars  to  help  our SMEs.  It is  imperative  that  we\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  extent  of  how much  of  these  funds  have\r\n\r\nbenefited  our SMEs and also their corresponding contribution\r\n\r\nto the overall economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data from such studies will also enable the Ministry to\r\n\r\nformulate  more  meaningful policies, reformulate  Government\r\n\r\nassistance  programmes  and  schemes  so  that  they   remain\r\n\r\nrelevant  to  SMEs'  needs and, more importantly,  that  such\r\n\r\nschemes  are effective in propelling them to greater  heights\r\n\r\nof achievement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on my cut on human resource development expertise\r\n\r\nin  SMEs.  It is a fact that in a KBE, human capital  to  any\r\n\r\norganisation  becomes  the  key  resource  as  it  holds  the\r\n\r\nknowledge and skills required, not only for growth  but  also\r\n\r\nin  many cases for organisational survival.  Management  guru\r\n\r\nPeter  Drucker  predicted that in many  developed  societies,\r\n\r\nknowledge workers would be the largest single population  and\r\n\r\nworkforce group.  Organisations in developed nations have  no\r\n\r\nchoice  but  to  manage workers effectively to harness  their\r\n\r\nfull potential, retain them or risk becoming obsolete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge base and skills complexity requirements of\r\n\r\nour  SMEs  are  increasing  by  the  day  to  maintain  their\r\n\r\nrelevance   in   an   increasingly   sophisticated   business\r\n\r\nenvironment.   However, I am concerned, Sir, that  our  SMEs,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  smaller ones, generally lack human  resource\r\n\r\ndevelopment and human resource management expertise to manage\r\n\r\nand  properly  motivate their workforce.  As a  result,  high\r\n\r\nturnover of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstaffing  and  absence of structured HRD and  HRM  programmes\r\n\r\ntranslates  into loss of valuable talent and  expertise  when\r\n\r\ntheir  trained personnel leave or lower productivity  due  to\r\n\r\nlow staff morale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smaller companies also lack the ability to attract high\r\n\r\nquality staff due to their limited resources and also absence\r\n\r\nof human resource expertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I am well aware that the Government has already\r\n\r\na  wide range of assistance schemes available to help SMEs, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to propose that either a new special  assistance\r\n\r\nscheme  be  devised to specifically assist SMEs  to  beef  up\r\n\r\ntheir  HRD and HRM capabilities or a current scheme, such  as\r\n\r\nthe PSB's People Developer Scheme, be expanded to incorporate\r\n\r\na  structured  approach to linking HRD and  HRM  to  business\r\n\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I just remind hon.

But they are given more  in  the\r\n\r\nform  of  technical  assistance  schemes  such  as  training,\r\n\r\nconsultancy and so on, to help the companies modernise  their\r\n\r\nmanagement,  adopt technology and help them  to  become  more\r\n\r\nproductive and efficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we have come to a stage today where the\r\n\r\nSMEs  need  more  than just these.  And I  am  talking  about\r\n\r\nsupport today by the Government in the form of equity to help\r\n\r\nthem  to  capitalise better and to grow more aggressively  so\r\n\r\nthat they can go into the region.  I know that the Government\r\n\r\ndoes  this already through Temasek Holdings, NSTB, EDBI,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.   But  these are more investments in large companies,\r\n\r\nlarge  projects,  and when they have already succeeded,  they\r\n\r\nstart looking at you and putting money into you.  At the very\r\n\r\nstart-up stage, we have got Vertex and some start-up funds,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nventure capital funds, to look at start-up phases.  But  SMEs\r\n\r\nare  somewhere  in-between where they seem to lack  financial\r\n\r\nsupport from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is a gap which I hope the Government would\r\n\r\naddress and try to close.  I am not talking about big stakes,\r\n\r\nI am talking about token stakes of 5% to 10%, and they should\r\n\r\nleave  the  management  of these companies  to  the  founding\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  and to professionals employed,  so  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  become a GLC.  When they go into the region,  they\r\n\r\nshould also not be perceived as a GLC.  But, I think when the\r\n\r\nmarket  knows  that  there  is  financial  support  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in the form of a shareholder, this would help them\r\n\r\nwhen they regionalise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take a look at the Enterprise 50 companies, Sir,\r\n\r\na  lot  of  them have gotten to where they are today  without\r\n\r\nfinancial support from the Government, and it has taken  them\r\n\r\na long time, many years.  Some of them have been in operation\r\n\r\nfor  more than 10 years.  If they were to become big  in  the\r\n\r\nregion without financial support from the Government, imagine\r\n\r\nhow  long  more  it will take for them to become  a  regional\r\n\r\ncompany  and even a world-class company.  I do not  think  we\r\n\r\nhave  this  kind  of time to wait.  So I am  suggesting  that\r\n\r\nperhaps  the Government should lend them a hand so that  they\r\n\r\ncan actually become a world-class company a lot quicker.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  ask the Minister to do more to help SMEs to improve\r\n\r\ntheir  R&D activities.  Companies must innovate in  order  to\r\n\r\nthrive.   R&D  is  not  only  a luxury  of  Government,  huge\r\n\r\ncorporations or large MNCs, but a necessary survival tool for\r\n\r\nmost  companies.   In  the  face  of  increasing  competition\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by  a  more  open economy,  R&D  is  a  vital\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge, one that determines whether a company  wins\r\n\r\nor loses a contract, between making or breaking the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last couple of days I was involved in a major\r\n\r\ntender,  one where the incumbent is a local SME, but  it  was\r\n\r\nunable  to retain the business because it was unable to  help\r\n\r\nthe client grow the business in the region and has a lack  of\r\n\r\nbusiness   process.   This  really  typifies  the   kind   of\r\n\r\nchallenges that SMEs face as they try to grow their  business\r\n\r\nin  the  region.   R&D  is  crucial to  creating,  innovating\r\n\r\nproductivity  and process improvement which are prerequisites\r\n\r\nfor  SMEs  in  preparing for the challenges  ahead,  ie,  (1)\r\n\r\nfacing  an  unfamiliar  country  and  market  condition;  (2)\r\n\r\nadapting  its products and services to consumers of different\r\n\r\nbackgrounds, tastes and preferences; (3) confronting  a  very\r\n\r\ncomplex business practice overseas that is more likely to  be\r\n\r\nvery  protective  of the domestic market and  interests,  and\r\n\r\nmore often than not we are seen as very suspicious aliens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, despite all these, SMEs are spending too little\r\n\r\ntime  and  perhaps effort on R&D.  According to the  National\r\n\r\nSurvey  of  R&D 1999, although some SMEs spend an average  of\r\n\r\n3.5%  of  their total expenditure on R&D, compared  to,  say,\r\n\r\n2.7% in large corporations and 1.2% in MNCs, it does not seem\r\n\r\nto bring about the desired result, if you consider the number\r\n\r\nof  patents being awarded arising from these R&Ds compared to\r\n\r\nresearch  conducted  by higher institutions,  Government  and\r\n\r\npublic research institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one looks at the criteria for applying these grants\r\n\r\nfor R&D, it is clear that it is targetted to assist companies\r\n\r\nthat  will  conduct  research  to  create  and  discover  new\r\n\r\nknowledge  that  will  perhaps  revolutionise  the  industry.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  fact is that R&D in SMEs is  not  about  these\r\n\r\nthings  that would revolutionise the industry.  It is  a  lot\r\n\r\nmore  basic.   It is about process improvement,  finding  and\r\n\r\nmaking  that  little improvement and differences  that  would\r\n\r\nallow  the  company to go one step forward and for  many,  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  another day, to fight another challenge and  to  win\r\n\r\nthe  next contract.  It is not likely to emerge a new patent,\r\n\r\nwhich  is one of the three criteria in allocating R&D  funds.\r\n\r\nTherefore, R&D funds should be made\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  easily  available  to SMEs to  conduct  basic  research\r\n\r\nwhich,  I believe, in any case forms a small but an important\r\n\r\npart of a larger research network that would create a healthy\r\n\r\nR&D environment of knowledge creation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a number of suggestions for the Minister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To make these funds more accessible for such basic\r\n\r\nresearch, because the aim is to encourage research activities\r\n\r\nwithin  the company and hopefully to spur bigger attempts  in\r\n\r\nthe future;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We should be realistic about the goals. Not all\r\n\r\nwill  succeed,  except the fact that the ideal and  necessary\r\n\r\npre-conditions  for research may not be there  in  many  SMEs\r\n\r\nwhich  are  usually  under-staffed  and  may  not  have   the\r\n\r\nspecialist talents one would find in MNCs;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Expertise from local tertiary institutions,\r\n\r\nespecially from the polytechnics, are a potential  source  of\r\n\r\nresearch   expertise.    Make   them   available   to   these\r\n\r\nenterprises.   Allow and encourage them to take up  secondary\r\n\r\nappointments in SMEs;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Government research institutions should allocate\r\n\r\npart  of  their  research for the specific benefit  of  SMEs,\r\n\r\nespecially  on the softer aspect of research, like  marketing\r\n\r\nintelligence and development, helping companies to enter  new\r\n\r\nmarkets,   cutting  costs  and  developing  right   marketing\r\n\r\nstrategies  which are certainly more urgent and important  to\r\n\r\nthese SMEs than hard research.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore encourage that the Minister review some of\r\n\r\nthese criteria in allocating R&D grants for SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, we have taken the right\r\n\r\napproach by focusing on life sciences as the long term driver\r\n\r\nof  our  economic growth.  If we do not start now,  Singapore\r\n\r\nrisks  becoming  the  receiver of technology  instead  of  an\r\n\r\ninnovator.   This was the pattern of our economic development\r\n\r\nduring  the last industrial revolution in the last  30  years\r\n\r\nwhere  our  success as a developing economy was a  result  of\r\n\r\nSingapore getting the lower value chain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof   activities  of  the  electronics  industry   while   the\r\n\r\ninnovation of technologies occurred in USA, Europe and Japan.\r\n\r\nIn  the  last 10 years we have changed that trend but in  the\r\n\r\nbeginning,  that  was how our economic development  happened.\r\n\r\nThis  time  we  must  take a lead or at least  be  among  the\r\n\r\nleaders if we want real economic prosperity as a result of  a\r\n\r\nsuccessful  life  sciences industry.  I  have  the  following\r\n\r\nthree questions for the Minister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the target in terms of contribution to GDP\r\n\r\nby the life sciences industry in the next 10 to 20 years?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Has the current effort been too Government driven?\r\n\r\nDo  we  want  to  go  the route of GLCs again  for  the  life\r\n\r\nsciences industry?  Can we invite and incentivise the private\r\n\r\nsector to play a leading role in this case?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can the Government set aside a high-risk fund,\r\n\r\nmanaged  by  the  private sector to stimulate  the  industry?\r\n\r\nThis  would be helpful for two reasons.  First, we need  many\r\n\r\nto  try,  of which many will also fail, but we will need  the\r\n\r\ncritical mass to be involved in order to develop just  a  few\r\n\r\ngood  companies  capable of competing in  a  global  economy.\r\n\r\nSecond,  when we started the IT revolution a few  years  ago,\r\n\r\nfunds  were  difficult to come by.  A number of  our  budding\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  faced  tremendous difficulties  in  the  early\r\n\r\nstages  and  some even left for the Silicon Valley  or  other\r\n\r\nparts of the world.  It was only in the last two years or  so\r\n\r\nwhen  funds  availability improved. This time round  we  will\r\n\r\nneed to repeat the same boom we saw for the IT-type companies\r\n\r\nsome  years ago, before the life sciences industry.  So funds\r\n\r\nwill  be  very critical in trying to stimulate the growth  of\r\n\r\nsuch industries in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, it was recently reported that\r\n\r\nthe Changi Airport hotel site had no takers.  Presumably, the\r\n\r\neconomics  did  not support that particular  investment.   Is\r\n\r\nthis  merely a function of the cyclical downturn or is  it  a\r\n\r\nreflection  of  the underlying difficulty  with  deriving  an\r\n\r\nacceptable  return  on  investments in hotels  in  Singapore?\r\n\r\nTaken together with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  bumper  10.5%  growth to a record  7.7  million  tourist\r\n\r\narrivals in year 2000, this must be slightly puzzling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nrevisit the value-added potential of the hospitality business\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, with a view to modifying the existing industry\r\n\r\nstructure and Government support where necessary.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in measuring the effectiveness of our efforts, the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Tourism  Board  has  inclined  towards  throughput\r\n\r\nmeasures, such as tourist arrivals, average length  of  stay,\r\n\r\nhotel  occupancy  rates.   However,  our  preoccupation  with\r\n\r\nclocking in arrivals must be accompanied by a focus on yields\r\n\r\nor,  simply, profitability.  For example, when we look at the\r\n\r\nspending per tourist-day or similar measures, the picture may\r\n\r\nbe less pretty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Singapore Hotel Association, total\r\n\r\noperating  costs  averaged 78% of revenues,  excluding  fixed\r\n\r\ncharges  of  typically another 10%.  Thus, operating  margins\r\n\r\nare   razor   thin  at  best,  making  investments  generally\r\n\r\ndifficult.  Neither is there a meaningful capital gain to  be\r\n\r\nrealised as transactions of pure hotel assets are few and far\r\n\r\nbetween.   I  would  therefore like to ask  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\ndescribe what he would regard as value-drivers for the  hotel\r\n\r\nindustry  and  whether  the existing industry  structure,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  supply of rooms and mix of hotels,  would  require\r\n\r\nmodification.    I  would  also  like  to   know   what   his\r\n\r\nconsiderations   are  when  designing  incentives   for   the\r\n\r\nhospitality industry.  Specifically, how would the  Strategic\r\n\r\nThrust of the Tourism 21 plan relating to the enhancement  of\r\n\r\nthe  existing  operating environment via attractive  tax  and\r\n\r\nother incentives be fleshed out?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, Sentosa Island is one of the\r\n\r\nmain  attractions  for tourists and a favourite  recreational\r\n\r\nplayground of Singaporeans.  In land scarce Singapore, it  is\r\n\r\nindeed a very valuable piece of real\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nestate.  One of the regular grouses of Sentosa is the  hassle\r\n\r\nof  getting  there.   When you get there, the  difficulty  is\r\n\r\ngetting  around due to the very inefficient monorail  system.\r\n\r\nThis problem will be solved when eventually there will be MRT\r\n\r\nlinks to the island.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maximise the potential of Sentosa, I would like to\r\n\r\nsuggest  to the Minister to give further thought in improving\r\n\r\nthe  local  transportation in Sentosa.  Perhaps, an efficient\r\n\r\nnetwork  of LRT and a large fleet of small buses will enhance\r\n\r\nthe  speed  and  convenience for visitors to  get  around  in\r\n\r\nSentosa.   Secondly,  money spent  on  future  new  and  bold\r\n\r\nattractions,  eg,  theme  parks,  fun  rides,   museums   and\r\n\r\ntheatres,  will be money worth spending as tourists  will  be\r\n\r\nattracted to stay longer in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I sincerely feel that if we could give bold and\r\n\r\nimaginative ideas and attractions to be developed in Sentosa,\r\n\r\nit  will  have a tremendous impact on the tourism income  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to ask about the\r\n\r\nstatus  of  the Sentosa Cove project.  Bringing residents  to\r\n\r\nSentosa  is  a  very  good move.  It  will  add  life  there.\r\n\r\nSentosa  Cove  will  provide a very  pleasant  resort  living\r\n\r\nenvironment.  However, it was reported that this Sentosa Cove\r\n\r\nproject  will be deferred.  What are the reasons?   What  are\r\n\r\nthe problems causing the deferment?  Also would the MRT links\r\n\r\nbe  provided to Sentosa Cove to enhance its attraction  as  a\r\n\r\nprime residential area in future?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, first, allow me to thank Members of this House\r\n\r\nwho have spoken on MTI's budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From MTI's perspective, this year's budget is a very\r\n\r\ngood  budget  because  it is pro-enterprise.   The  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  is completely open and highly dependent on  external\r\n\r\ndemand.  We are like a ship sailing in the ocean, we  are  in\r\n\r\ncontrol only of the ship.  We have to take the ocean for what\r\n\r\nit  is.   Of course, if we have good radars and good  weather\r\n\r\nforecasts,  that  is  very good.  But, otherwise,  we  adjust\r\n\r\nourselves to external conditions.  What is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportant  is  that we should stay competitive  whatever  the\r\n\r\nsituation,   keep  costs  down,  upgrade  our   capabilities,\r\n\r\nfacilitate restructuring, help those who are badly  affected,\r\n\r\nstay united.  By cutting taxes, and cutting them the most for\r\n\r\nSMEs,  the  budget  strengthens us on the  supply  side,  and\r\n\r\navoids  the idea that it should be subsidies that  will  keep\r\n\r\nindustries  moving forward, a point which Mr  Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although investments into Southeast Asia slowed down\r\n\r\nduring the financial crisis, EDB was able to keep up the flow\r\n\r\nof  investments into Singapore in the last three years.  Last\r\n\r\nyear,   manufacturing  investment  commitments   exceeded   a\r\n\r\nhistorical  high  of  S$9 billion.   It  is  this  inflow  of\r\n\r\ninvestments  that keeps the entire economy  going.   When  we\r\n\r\ndiscuss SMEs, it is important not to forget the main picture,\r\n\r\nwhich  is the total investment flow into Singapore.  If  that\r\n\r\nis  maintained,  then the game is on.  If  that  shrinks  and\r\n\r\nshrivels,  then  the  SME  game  itself  is  very  much  more\r\n\r\ndifficult to play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, we have not done badly. The investments\r\n\r\nthat  we have been able to attract of late are also of better\r\n\r\nquality.   Take  two recent examples.  UMC of  Taiwan,  in  a\r\n\r\njoint  venture with Infineon of Germany, will build a  US$3.6\r\n\r\nbillion  12-inch wafer fab plant in Singapore.  That  is  our\r\n\r\nbiggest investment by one company.  And it will attract other\r\n\r\nindustry players to come to Singapore and it will benefit our\r\n\r\nSMEs.   Another project recently announced last month is  the\r\n\r\n$1  billion investment by Toshiba and Matsushita to  build  a\r\n\r\nplant  to  manufacture  Thin Film Transistor  Liquid  Crystal\r\n\r\nDisplays.   Eventually, these flat wide screen displays  will\r\n\r\nreplace  the cathode ray tubes that we see in most television\r\n\r\nsets  today.  This is the first such plant outside Japan  and\r\n\r\nit is a coup for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both these successes will create many new opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  SMEs.  Credit must go to Mr Philip Yeo and the  officers\r\n\r\nof  EDB  and  JTC who worked tirelessly during  the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis to make sure that new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvestments  continued to come in.  Mr Yeo has  since  handed\r\n\r\nEDB  over to Mr Teo Ming Kian to lead the development of  the\r\n\r\nBiomedical Sciences at NSTB, which is another area  of  long-term importance to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to place on record\r\n\r\nin  this House MTI's deep appreciation to the leaders of NTUC\r\n\r\nand the labour movement for their support of the Government's\r\n\r\npro-growth  policies.  Without the labour movement's  support\r\n\r\nof  the CPF cut during the Asian financial crisis, EDB  could\r\n\r\nnot  have succeeded.  I listened carefully to Mr Thomas  when\r\n\r\nhe  reminded Government on Monday to restore the remaining 4%\r\n\r\nas  quickly  as possible.  That is part of the fair  bargain.\r\n\r\nOur  collective  resolve to reduce costs when  necessary  and\r\n\r\nmaintain  competitiveness sends a  strong  signal  to  global\r\n\r\ninvestors  and give them confidence to invest  big  bucks  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and we need these big bucks to keep  the  economy\r\n\r\nhumming.  I thank Mr Hawazi for speaking in favour of our FTA\r\n\r\nnegotiations on behalf of the trade unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about SMEs in greater detail. As many\r\n\r\nMPs  have  pointed out, despite the strong growth last  year,\r\n\r\nmany SMEs, especially those in the retail sector, did not  do\r\n\r\nwell.   But not all SMEs did badly.  In particular,  SMEs  in\r\n\r\nthe  wholesale and services sector enjoyed growth  comparable\r\n\r\nto  the  large  firms.   However, with slow  economic  growth\r\n\r\nexpected this year, more SMEs would be affected. As  MPs,  we\r\n\r\ncan  already  feel this slowdown on the ground.  And  several\r\n\r\nMPs, including Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Ahmad Magad, Mr Lew  Syn\r\n\r\nPau  and Mr Zulkifli Baharudin have stressed the need to help\r\n\r\nSMEs  cope  with the changes, and many good ideas  have  been\r\n\r\nproposed in this House.  Let me reiterate what Dr Richard  Hu\r\n\r\nsaid, that the Government is fully committed to helping local\r\n\r\nenterprises meet the challenges of this economic slowdown and\r\n\r\nthe challenges of the New Economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a wide array of assistance schemes and\r\n\r\nprogrammes and, no doubt, we will need more.  But  the  point\r\n\r\nis any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSME  which  wants  to upgrade will receive assistance.   Yes,\r\n\r\nthere may be ignorance and we will try our best to reach  out\r\n\r\nto  them.   But in the end, they must meet us half  way.   We\r\n\r\ncannot shield SMEs from competition, but we will help them to\r\n\r\ncompete  better.   For  those  whose  trades  are  no  longer\r\n\r\ncompetitive or do not wish to carry on, we will help them  to\r\n\r\nexit and to move on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Lew Syn Pau and Mr Inderjit Singh pointed out,\r\n\r\namong our SMEs, there are a few with the potential to make it\r\n\r\nbig  in  the  world.  With ingenuity, courage and good  luck,\r\n\r\nthey  too  can  become  like Creative  Technology.   And  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will support them under our PLC scheme  and  PSME\r\n\r\nscheme.  To answer Mr Inderjit Singh's point, we have  fallen\r\n\r\nshort  on  our PLC scheme target, but that is to be  expected\r\n\r\nbecause  of the economic crisis.  The point is, yes, we  have\r\n\r\nthis wish to create Creatives and Nokias.  But it is not easy\r\n\r\nif  you  look  at other small countries like New Zealand  and\r\n\r\nDenmark.  They have not been all that successful.  Yes,  from\r\n\r\ntime to time, there will be a huge success which should bring\r\n\r\nus   all  pride,  and  such  successes  should  serve  as  an\r\n\r\ninspiration  for  all of us.  Government  cannot  make  these\r\n\r\nbets.   The  global  market will have to  do  it.   But  what\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  do  is  to provide a nurturing  environment,\r\n\r\nimprove  the  odds,  but let the market settle  who  are  the\r\n\r\nwinners and who are the losers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we are seeing a new breed of entrepreneurs and\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Some are led by second-generation family  owners,\r\n\r\nothers  are professionals who have less secure jobs in  MNCs.\r\n\r\nAnd more than 80 such companies are listed on the local Stock\r\n\r\nExchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our GLCs should be helpful, but I do not think our GLCs\r\n\r\nshould  play  a  big  brother role.  In fact,  the  criticism\r\n\r\nagainst  them is that they have too dominant a role which  is\r\n\r\nin  fact not true.  As I mentioned in this House, their share\r\n\r\nof  GDP  is  only 12.9%, counting all companies in which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has 20 or more percent controlling interest.   And\r\n\r\nmany local\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies have received support from PSB and EDB.   Like  our\r\n\r\nbarbecued  pork  retailer, Bee Cheng Hiang,  which  has  done\r\n\r\nquite well by franchising its outlets overseas and now has 28\r\n\r\noutlets  from Manila to Mauritius.  Or Informatics  Holdings,\r\n\r\nan IT training school, which now operates over 300 schools in\r\n\r\n30  countries in Asia, Europe, Middle East and Africa.   That\r\n\r\nis  not bad.  Or Biosensors International, which has received\r\n\r\ngrants  and  support  from our research  institutions,  which\r\n\r\ninvented  the  S-Stent, a device used for coronary  diseases.\r\n\r\nBecause  it is more flexible, it is more suitable  for  Asian\r\n\r\nsizes,  and  it  hopes  to become the first  high-tech  Asian\r\n\r\nmedical device manufacturer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as our companies grow, TDB will help them globalise\r\n\r\nthrough   trade  investment.   With  e-commerce  and   market\r\n\r\nliberalisation, the opportunities for globalisation are  much\r\n\r\ngreater.  We will rejig our incentives to see what we can  do\r\n\r\nto help them, and feedback from Members in this House is very\r\n\r\nuseful to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assistance schemes are broadbased. Last year, the\r\n\r\nGovernment committed $1.2 billion to assist SMEs, up 50% from\r\n\r\nthe  previous  year.   A total of 108,000  applications  were\r\n\r\napproved,  as  compared to 88,000 in the previous  year.   Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh  asked  if we have too many  schemes  because\r\n\r\nthere  are  60-plus,  mentioned by  Dr  Richard  Hu,  causing\r\n\r\nconfusion.   We have been rationalising and we will  continue\r\n\r\nto  do  so.  But because SMEs cover such a wide area, 100,000\r\n\r\nin  Singapore,  so many different sectors,  we  have  got  to\r\n\r\ncustomise  our  schemes.  It is not possible to  have  a  few\r\n\r\nsizes-fit-all,  because then there will be no  good  fit  for\r\n\r\nmost cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad suggested that we tailor-make some\r\n\r\nassistance schemes for human resource development.   This  is\r\n\r\nindeed  an important area of emphasis.  SMEs can make use  of\r\n\r\nLETAS  for this purpose which defrays up to 50% of  the  fees\r\n\r\npaid  to consultants who help them.  But we will look at  how\r\n\r\nwe can widen the people developer scheme to take into account\r\n\r\nthe points made by Mr Ahmad Magad.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli suggested encouraging SMEs to do more R&D,\r\n\r\nand  for  PSB to widen the criteria so that more of them  can\r\n\r\nqualify for such grants.  It is not easy, because, for  SMEs,\r\n\r\nR&D  is not too different from normal operations.  And we  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  the grants given by PSB to lead to moral  hazards.\r\n\r\nBut  we  will look at Mr Zulkifli's proposals and see how  we\r\n\r\ncan accommodate the genuine cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau asked whether the Government can provide\r\n\r\nmore  equity  support  to SMEs, and Mr Inderjit  Singh  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  the  TIF  fund can be relaxed  to  include  low-tech\r\n\r\ncompanies.   It  is  not easy.  For high-tech,  yes,  we  can\r\n\r\ndefine  clear  criteria,  but, for low-tech,  who  is  to  be\r\n\r\nhelped?  And it is politically invidious for us to help some,\r\n\r\nand  not  the  others.  So, what we have  done  is,  we  have\r\n\r\ncreated  the  Promising  Local  Enterprises  Scheme  and  the\r\n\r\nPromising  SME schemes, with definite criteria, and,  if  you\r\n\r\nmeet   these   criteria,  then  you  are   given   particular\r\n\r\nassistance.  I think that is what we can do.  If we  need  to\r\n\r\nwiden  the criteria, we will do so.  But if we have too  many\r\n\r\nsuch  case-by-case assistance packages, I think it will  open\r\n\r\nus to a lot of criticisms and also to possible abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To open up more opportunities for local SMEs overseas,\r\n\r\nwe  will try to make Singapore an international hub for SMEs.\r\n\r\nSMEs in other countries are keen to hub in Singapore in order\r\n\r\nto  use  Singapore as a base to operate in the wider  region,\r\n\r\nand  we  have good information sources here.  So, to try  and\r\n\r\nachieve  this,  PSB  and JTC are cooperating  to  develop  an\r\n\r\nInternational SME Business Hub in Jurong East by the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year.  It will house both local and foreign  SMEs,  and\r\n\r\nalso  overseas SME agencies.  The Singapore Confederation  of\r\n\r\nIndustries (SCI) will be the anchor tenant, and we hope that,\r\n\r\nby  providing affordable office spaces, more foreign SMEs and\r\n\r\nstart-ups will set up shop here, and this will help  our  own\r\n\r\nlocal SMEs to regionalise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To promote sector-level restructuring, PSB will continue\r\n\r\nto incentivise the formation of franchises, economic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngroupings and shared services.  This is in line with Mr Leong\r\n\r\nHorn Kee's suggestion to help group SMEs together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh\r\n\r\nthat  the retail sector requires particular attention.  There\r\n\r\nare  a  number  of structural problems: an excess  supply  of\r\n\r\nretail space, low productivity and poor service levels.   And\r\n\r\ngiven  the  changing  shopping patterns of  Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nstrong  competition  from supermarkets, departmental  stores,\r\n\r\nand  Johor Bahru, our SMEs are going through a difficult time\r\n\r\nand  they  would  have to readjust themselves and  reposition\r\n\r\nthemselves, given the fact of these changes.  We cannot  just\r\n\r\nstay put.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, PSB has got industry players to get\r\n\r\ntogether,  and the result is the Retail 21 plan announced  by\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  Boon  Heng, Chairman of PSB, yesterday.   Many  good\r\n\r\nrecommendations have been made under the rubric of Retail 21.\r\n\r\nThe  Government supports Retail 21, and a $16 million  Retail\r\n\r\n<br><br>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fund  has been announced.  We will follow up and  address\r\n\r\nmany of the specific points which several MPs have raised  in\r\n\r\nthis House today.  In addition, because many of our shops are\r\n\r\nin  the HDB estates, we need a special package to help  those\r\n\r\nwho  are in the trade, either to re-optimise the spaces  they\r\n\r\nhave,  to  upgrade their productivity, and to help those  who\r\n\r\nwish  to  exit,  to  do so, more easily.   Mr  Mah  Bow  Tan,\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development, will announce the  details\r\n\r\nof the package for HDB shops during his Ministry's budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internally within MTI, we have set up a Task Force to\r\n\r\nreview  our current efforts and programmes on the development\r\n\r\nof  local  enterprises.  We are relooking the  functions  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of JTC, NSTB, TDB and PSB, in  this  regard.\r\n\r\nWe   will  restructure  PSB  to  give  more  focus  to  local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  Over the years, PSB has taken on more  and\r\n\r\nmore  responsibilities and we intend to, as Mr Inderjit Singh\r\n\r\nrecommended,   privatise  and  corporatise  some   of   these\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  And we will do so not only  for  PSB,  but\r\n\r\nalso  for JTC and NSTB as well.  We want the statutory boards\r\n\r\nto be trim and light, with clear missions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB will devote more attention to the monitoring of\r\n\r\nSMEs, as suggested by Mr Ahmad Magad.  It will do surveys and\r\n\r\nresearch  on SMEs in greater detail, if necessary,  with  the\r\n\r\nhelp  of  the  universities.   I  welcome  Mr  Ahmad  Magad's\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that  the criteria for SMEs be widened,  to  take\r\n\r\ninto  account  new realities.  And we do revise our  criteria\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to  time.  For example, the criterion  for  fixed\r\n\r\nassets  was raised from $8 million to $15 million in 1995  to\r\n\r\nqualify more SMEs for Government assistance.  And, during the\r\n\r\nAsian crisis, the criteria for SMEs were adjusted further  so\r\n\r\nthat larger companies could make use of the facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the topic of science and\r\n\r\ntechnology.  Last year, we announced a $7 billion Science and\r\n\r\nTechnology 2005 Plan for the next five years, much  of  which\r\n\r\nwill  fund  research.  Mr Inderjit Singh has  suggested  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be greater private sector participation,  that\r\n\r\nthe Government should outsource public sector research to the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector, and provide grants to support joint industry\r\n\r\nresearch projects.  This is indeed our intent.  A key  thrust\r\n\r\nof  the  S&T plan is to support industry R&D.  And for  every\r\n\r\ndollar  spent by the Government on R&D, we attracted $3  from\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, our target is for private sector research\r\n\r\nto account for two-thirds of Singapore's gross expenditure on\r\n\r\nR&D   by   the  year  2005.   This  is  an  important  market\r\n\r\ndiscipline, that we are putting public monies in R&D to  good\r\n\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pushing on with life sciences as a long-term\r\n\r\nundertaking.   But, for the life sciences, we  cannot  expect\r\n\r\nquick  returns.  This is something for the longer-term.   Our\r\n\r\ngoal  is  to  attract  world-class companies,  and  become  a\r\n\r\nregional hub for clinical trials and drug development, and we\r\n\r\nneed to establish, layer by layer, a good infrastructure  for\r\n\r\nthe  biomedical  sciences.  It involves many  Ministries  and\r\n\r\nmany institutions.  But to answer Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingh's  question,  we  hope to  double  the  output  of  the\r\n\r\nbiomedical sciences industry to $12 billion in five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to all this, to a lot of what we do, is talent.\r\n\r\nWe  can  succeed  in the life sciences if we can  get  global\r\n\r\ntalent to help us.  Last year, I mentioned the assistance  of\r\n\r\nDr  Sydney Brenner of Cambridge, Dr Alice Huang and Dr  David\r\n\r\nBaltimore  of  Caltech.  Since then, we have  got  many  more\r\n\r\nscientists,  from  Japan, Europe, America and  Australia,  to\r\n\r\nhelp  us.   And they are helping us pro bono.  And  they  are\r\n\r\nhelping  us  because  they are convinced  that  we  are  dead\r\n\r\nserious,  are eager students and are likely to make progress.\r\n\r\nSo,  that  is  a  good signal.  We have also been  recruiting\r\n\r\noutstanding individuals who are prepared to leave prestigious\r\n\r\ninternational institutions to join us, like Professor  Edison\r\n\r\nLiu  from the National Cancer Institute of the US.   Born  in\r\n\r\nHong Kong, he has become one of the top scientists in America\r\n\r\nand,  when  he  decided  to come to  Singapore  to  head  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Genomic  Programme, many of  his  colleagues  were\r\n\r\nshocked.  Now he is helping us to recruit talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, like Dr Gunaretnam Rajagopal from Cavendish\r\n\r\nLaboratory   of   Cambridge,  Tamil,  Malaysian   origin,   a\r\n\r\nphysicist,  expert in biophysics and mathematical  modelling,\r\n\r\nhe  has  agreed to help us set up a Bioinformatics  Institute\r\n\r\nand,  as  you know, for a lot of the follow up on the genomic\r\n\r\nwork  and  on  the  work of proteins, we  need  computational\r\n\r\ncapabilities and high mathematics, and this Institute  is  an\r\n\r\nessential  part  of  our  total  effort  to  build   up   the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure for the biomedical sciences in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the EDB International Advisory Council, under\r\n\r\nDr  Tony  Tan's chairmanship, met in Singapore.  It  reviewed\r\n\r\nall  that we have done, took stock, and asked us to  look  at\r\n\r\nhow  we should move forward.  They felt very strongly, and  I\r\n\r\nthink  they  agree with MPs here, that we should do  more  to\r\n\r\nencourage innovation and risk-taking, in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their advice was published in the newspapers. Under\r\n\r\nTechnopreneurship 21,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  have reviewed many of our laws and regulations, like  our\r\n\r\nbankruptcy provisions, to make it easier for people  to  fail\r\n\r\nand try again, a point Mr Leong Horn Kee raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh would like to see venture capitalists\r\n\r\nchannel  more of their funds into Singapore investments.   He\r\n\r\nsuggested   that  we  increase  the  30%  quota   for   local\r\n\r\ninvestments  so  that  more  monies  would  be  available  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  companies,  especially  to  those  which  are   in\r\n\r\ntrouble.  We are reluctant to do this because it is  easy  to\r\n\r\nwaste  money, or to burn money, in this area.  Yes, companies\r\n\r\nwhich  show promise and are starved of cash, we should  help,\r\n\r\nand  we will help them.  But we cannot just loosen the spigot\r\n\r\nlike  that,  because  we have a fiduciary  responsibility  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans for the public funds which we are in charge  of.\r\n\r\nAnd  we still do not have the mass of start-ups and ideas  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to raise the percentage further.  But, having  said\r\n\r\nthat,  despite  the  crash  in high-tech  stocks,  we  should\r\n\r\npersist  in our efforts to build Singapore as a major  centre\r\n\r\nfor  the  global VC industry.  In fact, we should  see  these\r\n\r\ncrashes as an opportunity for us to move even further ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget debate last year, I remember Prof. Toh\r\n\r\nSee  Kiat  and other MPs cautioning us on the danger  of  the\r\n\r\ndot.com mania becoming a dot.con disaster, and NASDAQ started\r\n\r\ncrashing  shortly  after in April.  Mr Inderjit  Singh  knows\r\n\r\nthis  sector  well, and I agree with his assessment  that  we\r\n\r\nshould see this as a healthy correction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On extending a life-line to cash-strapped start-ups\r\n\r\nwhich  are  worth  saving, I have asked EDB to  consider  co-investing part of the existing Venture Investment Support for\r\n\r\nStart-ups Fund for this purpose.  Yes, we should speed up the\r\n\r\nprocess,  but  we cannot avoid due diligence.   Let  me  just\r\n\r\nemphasise  that  this  cannot be a  bail-out  for  non-viable\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technopreneurship development is a long-term\r\n\r\nundertaking.   The  Government is committed  to  building  an\r\n\r\nenterprise ecosystem and will push on with our T21\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nefforts.   And,  if  we need a greater  supply  of  money  to\r\n\r\nencourage global VC companies to have connections here and to\r\n\r\noperate  here, then we should be prepared to do so.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  we  are  studying  whether  we  need  a  TIF  II  to\r\n\r\nsupplement and build on the momentum of TIF I.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important part of the enterprise ecosystem is the\r\n\r\nproposed Buona Vista Science Hub being developed by JTC.  Let\r\n\r\nme assure Mr Inderjit Singh that this will not become another\r\n\r\nordinary industrial estate or business park.  We will use the\r\n\r\nBuona  Vista  Science  Hub  to  experiment  with  new  ideas,\r\n\r\nincluding radical changes to our regulatory environment.   It\r\n\r\nwould not be easy.  We will need many ministries and economic\r\n\r\nagencies to work together.  To facilitate the coordination, I\r\n\r\nhave  asked  Minister Lim Swee Say to chair a  multi-ministry\r\n\r\nsteering committee to get the Buona Vista Science Hub off the\r\n\r\nground  quickly.   It cannot be done by the  private  sector,\r\n\r\nbecause  our  existing  rules  and  regulations,  which  were\r\n\r\nperfected for the old economy, will kill many of our  efforts\r\n\r\nin the new economy, if we do not first change them.  So, this\r\n\r\nhas  got to be a publicly-driven initiative.  Later on,  yes.\r\n\r\nAs  we  are  confident with what we have done,  then  we  can\r\n\r\ndivest the investments to the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another key recommendation of the EDB Advisory Council\r\n\r\nwas  that Singapore should expand its regionalisation efforts\r\n\r\nand  develop stronger global links for market technology  and\r\n\r\ntalent.   The  Council  recommended  that  Singapore   should\r\n\r\nexploit  the  potential of a regional market of  2.8  billion\r\n\r\npeople  by  extending  our region to a 7-hour  flight  radius\r\n\r\nwithin  which  there will be rapidly-growing  middle  classes\r\n\r\nnumbering in the hundreds of millions in the future.  I  have\r\n\r\ncirculated a map to Members showing what this extended region\r\n\r\nwould   look   like.    Basically,  what   this   means   is,\r\n\r\nincreasingly,  in  all  our  policies,  we  should  see   our\r\n\r\ngeographical  hinterland to include China, India,  Japan  and\r\n\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This important recommendation by the international\r\n\r\nadvisers  fits in with our various efforts to negotiate  FTAs\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstrengthen  regional groupings.  But we can only  regionalise\r\n\r\nif  our own base in ASEAN is solid.  As Mr Leong Horn Kee and\r\n\r\nMr  Simon  Tay  pointed out, Singapore's economic  well-being\r\n\r\nmust  be  rooted  in  the region.  And we  follow  events  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and  Malaysia  closely  because  they  affect   us\r\n\r\ndirectly.       With     Indonesia,     despite     different\r\n\r\nadministrations, on the whole, we enjoy very good  relations.\r\n\r\nAfter  the  economic  crisis, Prime Minister  Goh  Chok  Tong\r\n\r\nextended  to  the Indonesians an economic assistance  package\r\n\r\nand  we  recently  concluded two gas deals, each  worth  US$8\r\n\r\nbillion  over  a 20-year period.  Within 5 to 10  years,  all\r\n\r\nhouseholds  in  Singapore will be using  Indonesian  gas  for\r\n\r\ncooking  and  we will soon be having gas coming  out  of  our\r\n\r\nears.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Malaysia, our relations with them at the economic\r\n\r\nlevel are very excellent.  Last Saturday, when I was up there\r\n\r\nfor  a  conference,  the  Johor MB and  I  had  a  very  good\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  and  Malaysia  and  Singapore  are  really   one\r\n\r\neconomic space for global manufacturing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Indonesia, we must take into account the fact that\r\n\r\nJakarta  will  give  greater autonomy to  the  provinces  and\r\n\r\nregencies in the coming years and we must begin to widen  our\r\n\r\nlinks  to  the  various  provinces  around  us.   The  Growth\r\n\r\nTriangle  Agreement already allows for this.  It  allows  the\r\n\r\nprovinces  of Indonesia and the states of Malaysia which  are\r\n\r\nincluded  within  this Growth Triangle to have  direct  links\r\n\r\nwith  Ministries  in  Singapore and it is  our  intention  to\r\n\r\nfollow   up  on  these  provisions  in  the  Growth  Triangle\r\n\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the wider region. China will loom\r\n\r\nlarger in the coming years and Northeast Asia is fast leaving\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia behind.  I have circulated a recent article by\r\n\r\nthe  Asian  Wall Street Journal highlighting  in  very  stark\r\n\r\nterms  how  much  Northeast Asia is  leaving  Southeast  Asia\r\n\r\nbehind and these are long-term trends.  This is the reason\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhy  we  are  working  very  hard to  move  ASEAN  along,  to\r\n\r\nintegrate  our economies further, to move into  services,  to\r\n\r\nremove  non-tariff barriers to trade, so that we  can  be  an\r\n\r\nalternative  manufacturing base to China.  China  is  a  free\r\n\r\ntrade  area  of  1.3  billion people.  We  have  500  million\r\n\r\npeople,  still divided and compartmentalised into 10 national\r\n\r\nmarkets.   So,  this  remains a very important  objective  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in ASEAN.  We are, of course, without saying,  one\r\n\r\nof  the  greatest supporters of the WTO in the world and  let\r\n\r\nthere  be no mistaking on support of the WTO, even though  we\r\n\r\nare  moving on FTAs.  As Mr Simon Tay, Mr Leong Horn Kee  and\r\n\r\nMr Hawazi pointed out, the regional FTA initiatives, far from\r\n\r\nweakening  the  WTO,  are already creating  very  interesting\r\n\r\ncompetitive  dynamics in the region, in the  world,  for  the\r\n\r\nlaunch  of  a  new  round.  It is good because  what  we  are\r\n\r\nproposing is not only WTO-consistent but also WTO plus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there have been some murmurs from the region, but I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this  is  because  of a lack  of  understanding  and\r\n\r\nbecause  of  discomfort that the status quo would  inevitably\r\n\r\nchange.  As Mr Simon Tay said, there is only the front  door.\r\n\r\nThere is no back door to AFTA because the Rules of Origin are\r\n\r\nvery clear on this issue - 40% within ASEAN, you are in.   If\r\n\r\nyou  are not in, you are out, whether or not you have an  FTA\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore.   This is in writing and all  the  Ministers\r\n\r\nunderstand this.  But what is interesting is that many of our\r\n\r\nneighbours  are  thinking along the same lines  as  us.   The\r\n\r\nformer   Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Supachai  from   Thailand,\r\n\r\nsupported  Singapore fully in our efforts and the new  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has indicated his support for Thailand having\r\n\r\nFTAs  with Australia and New Zealand.  Even Malaysia, I  have\r\n\r\nheard  from Japanese officials that they have been approached\r\n\r\nfor  an FTA between the two countries.  I believe by what  we\r\n\r\nhave done, the dynamics have altered for the better and it is\r\n\r\nclearly our objective to keep ASEAN strong and vital and  use\r\n\r\nASEAN as our own base to move into the extended region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Singapore Business Federation, Mr Leong Horn Kee\r\n\r\nand  Mrs  Lim  Hwee  Hua asked about its  progress.   I  have\r\n\r\nearlier  announced that the Government will enact legislation\r\n\r\nrequiring companies and businesses with a paid-up capital  of\r\n\r\n$0.5  million  or  more  to be members  of  the  SBF.   These\r\n\r\ncompanies  can  either join directly or via a chamber  or  an\r\n\r\nassociation.  A Protem Committee is being formed to establish\r\n\r\nand  run the SBF until the first council is elected.  Amongst\r\n\r\nother things, it will propose a constitution for the SBF  and\r\n\r\nhelp MTI to draft legislation and we will expose the draft to\r\n\r\nthe  business  community so that all views are  incorporated.\r\n\r\nThe Committee will be chaired by Mr Stephen Lee, Chairman  of\r\n\r\nSNEF,  and  would  include  representatives  from  local  and\r\n\r\nforeign  chambers.  I will release the list of members  later\r\n\r\nthis afternoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need a Board of Trustees to own the properties\r\n\r\nof  the  SBF and ensure that the key appointments of the  SBF\r\n\r\ncouncil  are  not  filled  by unfit candidates.   The  Protem\r\n\r\nCommittee  will ensure that the SBF represents the collective\r\n\r\ninterest  of businesses in Singapore, not just the big  boys,\r\n\r\nbut  also  the  small  players.  And  all  the  three  ethnic\r\n\r\nchambers  must  be included.  As foreign companies  based  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  contribute  significantly  to  our  economy,  they\r\n\r\nshould  also be adequately represented.  I hope that the  SBF\r\n\r\ncan be established by 1st September, assuming that Parliament\r\n\r\nagrees with the legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tourism promotion, I fully agree with Mrs Lim Hwee\r\n\r\nHua  that  value-added measures are a  better  gauge  of  our\r\n\r\ntourism  performance.  I will just give an example to support\r\n\r\nMrs   Lim's  point.   Although  visitor  arrivals  have  been\r\n\r\nincreasing  annually  by  4%,  from  1989  to  1999,  visitor\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  narrowly  defined, remained  flat  during  this\r\n\r\nperiod  because the average length of stay in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\ngone  down.  We have become so efficient, and also  per  diem\r\n\r\nexpenditure has come down.  But if we look at overall tourism\r\n\r\nreceipts  and  spin-offs  to the  larger  economy,  then  the\r\n\r\nbenefits are greater.  But I agree with Mrs Lim Hwee Hua that\r\n\r\nwe should look at\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhow we collect the indicators and present them to members  of\r\n\r\nthe public.  As to her remarks about specific proposals under\r\n\r\nTourism 21, this will be released shortly to the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On GLCs, Mr Leong Horn Kee talked about the dangers of\r\n\r\nGLC  dominance in Singapore.  This is a subject which I  have\r\n\r\ngiven  a  response to, which I should not  repeat  here.   Is\r\n\r\nthere a danger that GLCs are absorbing too many of our bright\r\n\r\n\"A\"  level students through scholarships and bonds?  I am not\r\n\r\nsure,  because parents now have more means and our  best  and\r\n\r\nbrightest  now have more alternatives open to them.  If  they\r\n\r\njoin the Government, the Armed Forces, the GLCs, non-GLCs  or\r\n\r\nif they decide to work overseas, it is really their decision.\r\n\r\nEven  for  bonds, there is no compulsion.  There is a  market\r\n\r\noperating  for bonds.  And it is like financial  instruments.\r\n\r\nIn  the  end,  you  have different packages, students  decide\r\n\r\nwhich  one  they  are interested in and they make  their  own\r\n\r\ndecisions  and  all agencies, including Government  agencies,\r\n\r\nwill  have to compete for their fair share of talent.  But  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  see,  in the next phase of our economic development,\r\n\r\nthe public sector cornering as large a proportion of the best\r\n\r\nand brightest, which we had to do in the last lap when we had\r\n\r\nto  build  up the basic institutions of state.   On  GLCs,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that a Parliamentary Question has been  filed  and\r\n\r\nnext week, the Minister responsible will give a full reply on\r\n\r\nhow we intend to divest our GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sentosa, Mr Leong Horn Kee asked about its\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  You have read in the papers that Mr  Philip  Ng\r\n\r\nhas  taken over from Mr Alan Choe as Chairman.  Mr Alan  Choe\r\n\r\ngave  his  life to Sentosa. He was there when  it  was  still\r\n\r\nPulau  Blakang Mati. He was there at the conception.  He  was\r\n\r\nthe  one who heard from Winsemius that we should not turn  it\r\n\r\ninto  a  fuel farm but conserve it as a tourism  resort.   He\r\n\r\ncreated the corporation, he chaired it.  He knows the  island\r\n\r\nlike  the  back of his hand.  If today Sentosa  has  such  an\r\n\r\ninternational reputation, it is because of Mr Alan  Choe.   I\r\n\r\nwould like today to record MTI's deep\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nappreciation to him for his tremendous contribution.  I thank\r\n\r\nhim also for agreeing to stay on to remain as Chairman of the\r\n\r\nexciting  Sentosa Cove development.  We are ready  to  launch\r\n\r\nbut  because  the property market has suffered significantly,\r\n\r\nwe  decided  to  hold  back for six months  to  reassess  the\r\n\r\nsituation  before deciding whether or not we  should  launch.\r\n\r\nFor  those of you who play golf on Sentosa island, you  could\r\n\r\nhave seen it from a vintage point and seen how beautiful  the\r\n\r\nsite is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the People Mover System on Sentosa, we are\r\n\r\nreviewing  it  because we have been reviewing  the  long-term\r\n\r\nplans  in  Sentosa.  We have got to be mindful of  the  cost.\r\n\r\nWhether  or  not  such a mover system should be  extended  to\r\n\r\nSentosa Cove depends on whether the economics justify it  and\r\n\r\nwhether additional investment is more than made up for by the\r\n\r\nincrease in property values.  These are issues being reviewed\r\n\r\nand it is premature for me to give you details right now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, can I take the two cuts\r\n\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> The need for a Fair Trading Act in\r\n\r\nSingapore in today's context cannot be understated as it  has\r\n\r\nbeen pursued by at least two of my predecessors in CASE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to consider such an Act began with the need to\r\n\r\naddress  the  problems faced particularly by HDB dwellers  in\r\n\r\ntheir  quest  to  rid  themselves of  the  persistent  vacuum\r\n\r\ncleaner  salesman who would not leave their premises even  at\r\n\r\nmidnight  until a deal was closed.  The salesman would  exert\r\n\r\nhigh pressure sales tactics, mislead the consumers on product\r\n\r\nfunctionalities, cajole the consumers and if all things fail,\r\n\r\nI understand that in the dead of the night, play the sympathy\r\n\r\ncard  of losing their job, having mouths to feed and  so  on.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, at the end of the day, consumers then in the 80s\r\n\r\nhad no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprotection of the law as there was no cooling-off period  and\r\n\r\nhigh-pressure sales were not easy to prove.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, such was not actionable in court due to\r\n\r\nthe   subtle  difference  between  misleading  and  deceptive\r\n\r\nconduct  which  the law would catch and that which  it  could\r\n\r\nnot.  For example, as long as an armchair was top leather and\r\n\r\nthe  bottom could be PVC, there was no remedy to the consumer\r\n\r\nwho  thought  he  was  buying  a  full  leather  armchair  or\r\n\r\nrepresented that that was leather.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation evolved to the more sophisticated time-share companies in the 90s, and which still persist today and\r\n\r\nwhere  consumers  are \"losing\" millions of dollars  in  high-pressure sales.  For example, young couples are identified on\r\n\r\nthe streets and then told of lucky draw winnings.  A visit to\r\n\r\nthe  company's premises, however, is necessary to collect the\r\n\r\nprize.   Both couples suitably enticed find that the trip  to\r\n\r\nthe  time-share  company can be the  beginning  of  the  most\r\n\r\ntrying part of their marriage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CASE has been told of couples being led from room to\r\n\r\nroom once inside the time-share company's premises, bombarded\r\n\r\nby sales person after sales person.  Even more horror stories\r\n\r\nof  drinks  being  spiked, and other  unconscionable  conduct\r\n\r\nbeing practised by these companies.  The problem is very real\r\n\r\nas bouncers are sent in some cases to collect dues, and after\r\n\r\nthe deal is closed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some even engaged lawyers to chase an airtight deal\r\n\r\nwhere  consumers had been made to sign away all their rights.\r\n\r\nCASE  has  seen  contracts  where the  consumer  signs  every\r\n\r\npossible right away.  CASE has seen women and men of all ages\r\n\r\nincluding professionals in a dilemma as to what to do. As the\r\n\r\nsums are large, CASE has to deal with the trauma and emotion,\r\n\r\nand even threats of suicide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the above illustrations show that, notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthe laws we have in Singapore, there are still loopholes that\r\n\r\nwe have to plug. More businesses have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\njoined  our call for a Fair Trading Act as such an  Act  will\r\n\r\nrid  their  respective industries of rogue traders  who  give\r\n\r\nthem  a bad name and also will mean that businesses can  then\r\n\r\ncompete  on  a level playing field and hence reduce  business\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister can consider implementing a\r\n\r\nFair  Trading  Act  to further enhance Singapore  as  a  fair\r\n\r\ntrading business hub and shopping hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move on to my next cut on trustmark. In an open\r\n\r\nmarket like Singapore, where goods and services can flow into\r\n\r\nthe  country freely, we must protect both consumers and  good\r\n\r\ntraders.   To  achieve  this, we need to  instill  trust  and\r\n\r\nconfidence  among  consumers and traders.   Although  a  Fair\r\n\r\nTrading  Act will provide the necessary legislative framework\r\n\r\nto  attain  a fair trading marketplace, consumer  and  trader\r\n\r\neducation  also plays an important part to ensure  that  fair\r\n\r\ntrading business transactions take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the development of Singapore into a global\r\n\r\ntrusted   business  hub,  CASE  has  embarked  on   two   key\r\n\r\ninitiatives, namely, CASETRUST, an accreditation  scheme  for\r\n\r\ngood business practices, and Consumer and Trader Education  - a  long-term programme for educating consumers and traders to\r\n\r\nenhance consumer protection in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for trustmark, CASE has announced its CASETRUST award\r\n\r\nin  December  last  year. It is preparing grounds  to  enable\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to  adopt  good business  practices  and  achieve\r\n\r\nbusiness  excellence.  I hope that the Ministry  can  provide\r\n\r\nfunding  to  spearhead  this scheme  to  be  a  national  and\r\n\r\ninternational  trustmark for Singapore.   Consumer  education\r\n\r\nhas always been a key thrust in enhancing consumer protection\r\n\r\n.  To-date, CASE has launched a series of intensive education\r\n\r\ndrives  aimed  at  the grassroots, consumers and  businesses.\r\n\r\nSuch  drives involve rotating around the constituencies  with\r\n\r\nseminars, speeches at both macro as well as micro levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry can consider setting up a consumer\r\n\r\neducation fund where like-minded organisations like CASE  can\r\n\r\ntap  on  this  fund to provide education to  consumers  on  a\r\n\r\nsustained   basis.   In  countries  like  New   Zealand   and\r\n\r\nAustralia,  government support has enabled many organisations\r\n\r\nto  provide  useful  consumer education  materials,  such  as\r\n\r\nleaflets  and information booklets, to consumers.   Educating\r\n\r\nconsumers will help to avoid and thereby reduce disputes, and\r\n\r\nwill be good for businesses overall.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, we should control\r\n\r\nand   regulate  suppliers  through  legislation  to   protect\r\n\r\nSingapore  consumers better.

I will\r\n\r\nonly  add  that  such  a  Fair  Trading  Act  should  contain\r\n\r\nprovisions that make it an offence for suppliers to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) make false or misleading representations in relation\r\n\r\nto  the  nature, characteristics, suitability or quantity  of\r\n\r\nthe products or services;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) engage in conduct that is unconscionable; some\r\n\r\nexamples  are  where  the supplier unduly influences,  exerts\r\n\r\npressure or uses unfair tactics on consumers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) engage in misleading and deceptive conduct in\r\n\r\nrelation to the goods or services; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) use bait advertising to lure customers, eg, a\r\n\r\nsupplier  cannot  advertise a service at a  particular  price\r\n\r\nwith no expectation of honouring it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister for Trade and Industry would\r\n\r\nconsider introducing such an Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, on electricity, there have been\r\n\r\nseveral reports and statements made by the Government about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  intention to privatise the generation of electricity and\r\n\r\nallow  more players into this sector.

This has added to living and business costs.  Hence,\r\n\r\nSir,  I raise this cut so that I could ask the Minister  what\r\n\r\nis  the  status with regard to attracting new operators  into\r\n\r\nthis   sector.   How  soon  or  how  much  faster   can   the\r\n\r\nprivatisation effort be pushed along?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I wish to ask whether the Government will\r\n\r\nallow  private operators to buy electricity from neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries, like Malaysia, for sale to Singapore-based  users.\r\n\r\nIt  may  be  possible  that there are  occasions  for  excess\r\n\r\nelectricity generated by Malaysia which they are prepared  to\r\n\r\nsell  to  us at competitive rates.  Unlike water, electricity\r\n\r\nis a less emotive and critical utility.  We should favourably\r\n\r\nconsider  sourcing  electricity from Malaysia  if  they  have\r\n\r\nexcess  to sell and we can use this source to supplement  and\r\n\r\ncover for the peak electricity demand periods.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, my issue on electricity is the\r\n\r\npower  disruptions that we have faced in the past few  years.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2000 alone, my company experienced 10 disruptions\r\n\r\nof  electricity.  So the whole industrial estate  down  there\r\n\r\nwas affected.  This is too many, especially for the high-tech\r\n\r\nwafer  fab, petro-chemical and semi-conductor industries.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore have the following issues:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is a need for more accountability and\r\n\r\npenalties   for  the  electricity  distribution   agency   to\r\n\r\ncompensate affected companies.

Without   adequate water supplies, Singapore  cannot\r\n\r\nsurvive.    Water   is  the  key  to  Singapore's   survival.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the importance of sufficient water supply  cannot\r\n\r\nbe over emphasised.  The bulk of our water supply is from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nanother jurisdiction  -  Johor.

From\r\n\r\ntime  to  time,  we hear of disturbing news from  across  the\r\n\r\nCauseway.   Threats are made by political groups  over  there\r\n\r\ncalling  on  their  government to cut  off  water  supply  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Johor government announced that they\r\n\r\nshall  be  requiring much of the water supplied to  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  their  own  use, and that they shall be  building  water\r\n\r\nprocessing   plants   themselves.   All   those   news   make\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  very uneasy.  The older generation Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncan still remember that when the Japanese Imperial Army early\r\n\r\nin 1942 reached Johor Bahru, they cut off the water supply to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and quickened the surrender of Singapore  to  the\r\n\r\nJapanese Imperial Army on 15th February 1942.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two water treaties with Johor. One expires in\r\n\r\nabout 2011 and the other sometime in 2062.  Singaporeans know\r\n\r\nvery little of the contents of these two agreements.  Can the\r\n\r\nMinister  give  the salient points in respect  of  these  two\r\n\r\nwater   agreements?   Is  it  possible  for   the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment, under these two agreements, to restrict  or  even\r\n\r\nstop  the supply of water to Singapore?  There seems to be  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  uncertainties  regarding  the  supply  of  water  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  from Malaysia.  In the light of what is  happening\r\n\r\nso far, including the threatening remarks made by Abdurrahman\r\n\r\nWahid,  the Indonesian President, after his recent  visit  to\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur, the Government has announced that the long-term\r\n\r\nsolution  to  Singapore's water problem is  to  make  use  of\r\n\r\nrecycled water, which also includes recycled sewage water.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask whether such recycled water is  only  for\r\n\r\nindustrial  use,  and  that  only  water  obtained  from  the\r\n\r\ndesalination plant is for human consumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I made the cut\r\n\r\non  the  same  point  as Mr Chiam's, to  try  to  reduce  our\r\n\r\ndependency on Malaysia for water.

I  believe it should not be  a  trump  card  for\r\n\r\nMalaysia  or  any  other  country to  hold  over  our  heads.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  in  the future, studies suggest that Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nindeed the whole region will be facing shortages of water  of\r\n\r\nsufficient quantity and quality.  As such, I would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to look more closely at desalination, recycling  and\r\n\r\nefficiency.  These should be our watchwords and should be  on\r\n\r\nstream  earlier.  Possible measures should include water  use\r\n\r\naudits,   incentives  for  households  and  the   design   of\r\n\r\nfacilities.   Tapping rainwater should also  be  improved  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these improvements, we should develop more security\r\n\r\nin  meeting our water needs.  Consequently, I would urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  that  we  can and should be more realistic  in  our\r\n\r\nnegotiations  with  Malaysia on this issue.   The  agreements\r\n\r\nlast until 2062.  We need not and cannot expect guarantees of\r\n\r\nwater   that  extend  well  beyond  the  lifetimes  of   most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   It  may  not be  possible  and   may  not  be\r\n\r\nrealistic, given the future contingencies for Malaysia's  own\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Peter Chen):</b> Sir, let me deal first with the Fair Trading\r\n\r\nAct.  I can understand Dr Teo Ho Pin's concern about consumer\r\n\r\nprotection but, truly, the best advice anyone can give to the\r\n\r\nbuyer  is  still the legal maxim caveat emptor  or  \"let  the\r\n\r\nbuyer beware\".  We should do well to remember the meaning  of\r\n\r\nthe  cliche  \"There's no free lunch.\"  Ultimately, if a buyer\r\n\r\nis  not careful or succumbs to a moment of greed, it is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to save him from being cheated or overcharged.  And\r\n\r\ntherefore  consumer education must continue to  be  the  main\r\n\r\npillar  or  our  policy  on  consumer  protection.   In  this\r\n\r\nparticular  area of consumer education, I want  to  place  on\r\n\r\nrecord MTI's appreciation of the good work that has been done\r\n\r\nby CASE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward, I would encourage CASE to take on an\r\n\r\neven more influential\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrole.   As  the  natural focal point for consumers  to  raise\r\n\r\ntheir  concerns, CASE would be able to sift through  all  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints, and help deserving cases to seek redress  through\r\n\r\nthe  Small Claims Tribunal and the courts.  CASE could  then,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  be the de facto fair trading office, but  separate\r\n\r\nfrom Government, so that the work is not politicised.  But it\r\n\r\nwould allow CASE to perform many of the watchdog functions of\r\n\r\nsafeguarding  and protecting the consumers.   These  are  two\r\n\r\nimportant points which Dr Teo and Dr Lily Neo are proposing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that CASE would need more teeth, and sharper\r\n\r\nteeth,  in  order to carry out its work.  CASE,  as  well  as\r\n\r\nseveral  Members  of  the House, has for some  time  already,\r\n\r\nsought MTI's support for a Fair Trading Act.  The purpose  is\r\n\r\nto  prohibit deceptive and unconscionable sales tactics  like\r\n\r\nbait  advertising, misrepresentation, as described by Dr Lily\r\n\r\nNeo,  or  hard selling, which seems not uncommon among  time-share marketeers.  However, we should always be mindful  that\r\n\r\nconsumer  protection legislation that is  too  onerous  would\r\n\r\nincrease  business  costs for both retailers  and  consumers.\r\n\r\nAnd  if CASE is agreeable, I would suggest that MTI and  CASE\r\n\r\njointly  lead a task force to discuss ways to strengthen  our\r\n\r\nconsumer  protection  laws,  including  the  possibility   of\r\n\r\nenacting a Fair Trading Act and the means to empower CASE  to\r\n\r\ncarry out its role more effectively.  Representatives of  the\r\n\r\ntask force can come from the Government, CASE and the private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo has also suggested setting up a new consumer\r\n\r\neducation  fund.   In  1996, we actually  started  a  funding\r\n\r\nmechanism  where the Government contributed dollar-for-dollar\r\n\r\ndonations  made  to  the CASE Endowment Fund.   And  I  would\r\n\r\nencourage  CASE  to  seek  greater  contributions  from   the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  so  as  to ensure that CASE continues  to  remain\r\n\r\nrelevant to the people it serves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On electricity, Mr Leong Horn Kee has asked about the\r\n\r\nliberalisation  of  our energy market.  This  is  progressing\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  energy sector is an important component of our  economy.\r\n\r\nWithin  the  broader framework of keeping our business  costs\r\n\r\ncompetitive,   we   have   to   keep   our   energy    market\r\n\r\ninternationally competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st April, Singapore Power will divest its two\r\n\r\ngeneration companies  -  Power Senoko and Power Seraya  -  to\r\n\r\nTemasek  Holdings and reposition itself as the owner  of  the\r\n\r\ntransmission  and  distribution system, which  is  a  natural\r\n\r\nmonopoly.  Singapore Power will be regulated and will not  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  participate  in the  competitive  parts  of  the\r\n\r\nelectricity business.  Temasek, in turn, will divest all  its\r\n\r\nthree generation companies  -  Power Senoko, Power Seraya and\r\n\r\nTuas Power  -  with no limit on foreign ownership.  This will\r\n\r\ntake  place  in  the second half of the year, after  the  new\r\n\r\nelectricity  market  begins  operating.   Work  on  the   new\r\n\r\nelectricity market is in progress and should be ready in  the\r\n\r\nsecond  half  of this year.  The Energy Market  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to be set up in April will take over the system and\r\n\r\nmarket  operations of the electricity system  from  Singapore\r\n\r\nPower.    It  will  be  responsible  for  the  security   and\r\n\r\nreliability of the energy supply.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will allow consumers to buy electricity from\r\n\r\ncompeting  retailers  in  stages,  starting  with   the   big\r\n\r\ncustomers.  Initially, some 11,000 customers who take up  70%\r\n\r\nof  our total electricity demand will be able to do this.  By\r\n\r\nthe   year  2003,  households  will  also  be  able  to   buy\r\n\r\nelectricity from competing retailers.  Since the announcement\r\n\r\nof the liberalisation last year, five new retailers have been\r\n\r\nlicensed and are preparing to enter the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong asked about the import of electricity from our\r\n\r\nneighbours.  This is already allowed, but so far it has  only\r\n\r\nbeen  used  for  emergencies.  However, for  system  security\r\n\r\nreasons,  the import of electricity from overseas is  limited\r\n\r\nto a maximum of 600 megawatts.  We are prepared to allow more\r\n\r\nimport under our new market structure, if these are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic.   However, it must not affect our  system  security\r\n\r\nand reliability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh commented on power dips and the need\r\n\r\nto ensure a reliable supply of electricity.  I agree with him\r\n\r\nthat  this  is an area where more improvements can  still  be\r\n\r\ndone.   Last year, there were a total of 34 dips,  two  fewer\r\n\r\nthan  in 1999.  Recent dips have been due to recurrent faults\r\n\r\nin  cable joints in two types of cables.  PowerGrid will take\r\n\r\nall  these  faulty cables out of service by the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also introduced several measures to control\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  cause power dips.  Construction  contractors\r\n\r\nface  stiff  penalties should they damage electrical  cables.\r\n\r\nLicences for both the customers' electrical installations and\r\n\r\ntheir  licensed electrical engineers will be suspended should\r\n\r\nthey repeatedly cause voltage dips.  Generation companies and\r\n\r\nthe  grid owner will also be fined if they cause dips.  These\r\n\r\nseries  of measures emphasise that we will not tolerate  acts\r\n\r\nthat  would  undermine  the reliability  of  our  electricity\r\n\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang referred to the high cost of\r\n\r\nelectricity.   Electricity tariffs are  set  to  reflect  the\r\n\r\neconomic  cost of power generation.  Fuel oil makes up  about\r\n\r\nhalf  the  cost  of producing electricity.   We  are  totally\r\n\r\ndependent  on  imported fuel to generate  electricity.   When\r\n\r\nworld  fuel oil prices increase, electricity prices  have  to\r\n\r\nfollow.   However, Singapore Power has tried to moderate  the\r\n\r\nimpact by spreading the tariff increase over a longer period.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot subsidise the consumption of electricity  as  this\r\n\r\nwould  lead to over-consumption and mask the real cost.   The\r\n\r\nbest  way  to  assist low-income families is to provide  some\r\n\r\nincome  support through rebates and the Utilities Save Scheme\r\n\r\nwhich the Government has just announced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay and Mr Chiam spoke on the need to secure\r\n\r\nour  water supply through a combination of sources.  This  is\r\n\r\nindeed  the strategy that we are taking.  We ensure that  our\r\n\r\nwater strategy is robust by diversifying our sources.  First,\r\n\r\nwe will continue to maximise local supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAlready 50% of our land is used for water catchment,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  implemented  stringent pollution  control  measures  to\r\n\r\nprotect  these catchments.  Secondly, we will try  to  expand\r\n\r\nour  regional  supply.   We have a long-term  agreement  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Thirdly, we are also exploring the development  of\r\n\r\nwater resources in Bintan.  We are also exploring development\r\n\r\nof  water resources by harnessing technology to augment these\r\n\r\nsupplies.   We will build sea water desalination plants.   We\r\n\r\nare  putting  in place infrastructure to recycle  used  water\r\n\r\ninto  ultra-clean  water, which we have called  NEWater,  for\r\n\r\nsupply to those industries which require large quantities  of\r\n\r\nhigh-grade water, such as wafer fabrication plants.  For  new\r\n\r\nsources   of  water,  we  will  encourage  private   sector's\r\n\r\nparticipation  by  leaving the choice of  technology  to  the\r\n\r\nmarket  and  for  the companies to supply water   to  PUB  on\r\n\r\ncommercial terms.  Together, this three-pronged strategy will\r\n\r\nensure  that  Singapore's water needs will be adequately  and\r\n\r\nsecurely met in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification.\r\n\r\nThe  Senior  Minister  of  State has  not  answered  the  two\r\n\r\nquestions  I  raised.   One,  is whether  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nconsidering  using other sources for electricity  generation,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, solar power or even nuclear power.  The second\r\n\r\nquestion is:  how does the Government ensure that the cost of\r\n\r\nelectricity  will not be a heavy burden to the  people  after\r\n\r\nthe power supply company is privatised?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> On the question of other sources of\r\n\r\nenergy  for  the generation of electricity,  it  is  not  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy to use nuclear power, and solar power  is\r\n\r\nnot  something that is commercially feasible on a large scale\r\n\r\nat  the moment.  There are other sources such as coal,  which\r\n\r\nseems  to be too pollutive.  We do not have any hydroelectric\r\n\r\npower.  So, at the moment, fossil fuel remains to be the only\r\n\r\nviable source as far as electricity is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to what measures do we have to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  cost of electricity will be kept low, it is hard to  say\r\n\r\nas that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndepends  on  fuel cost.  But we want to create an environment\r\n\r\nwhere  there is competition, and in the new structure,  which\r\n\r\nyou  will  hear  later,  we  want to  ensure  that  there  is\r\n\r\ncontestability; in other words, on the supply side  and  even\r\n\r\non  the  retailing  side.  At both ends of the  whole  supply\r\n\r\nchain,  there will be competition where there will be several\r\n\r\nplayers.

In granting the sale, JTC gives its  approval\r\n\r\non  condition that the subject property must be reinstated to\r\n\r\nits  original  condition.  I am aware of one such  sale.   At\r\n\r\nthis   juncture,  I  wish  to  declare  my  interest  as   an\r\n\r\nindependent  director  of a company  that  has  sold  such  a\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reinstatements will include such things as to\r\n\r\nrepair   damaged  fencing  and  driveway  along  the   common\r\n\r\nboundary,  to  paint  the factory buildings,  prune  and  cut\r\n\r\novergrown vegetation and overhanging tree branches,  to  tidy\r\n\r\nup  and clear up premises and remove debris from drains,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  I understand that even in HDB's case where the buyer\r\n\r\nand  seller  are both individuals, the rules on reinstatement\r\n\r\nare  much  simpler now.  As long as the buyer is prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept the property as it is, HDB usually waives the need  to\r\n\r\nreinstate the property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of the property in question, which apparently\r\n\r\nwas  delayed by the reinstatement and approval process,  took\r\n\r\nsome  five  months.   In this present day of  business  where\r\n\r\nbusiness is conducted at Internet speed, I think we  all  can\r\n\r\nagree  that five months to be allowed to transfer a  property\r\n\r\nseems like forever.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I shall be brief,\r\n\r\ntaking into account the time that we have left.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that we had discussed in this House at a\r\n\r\nsitting  in  January  this  year  the  issue  of  electricity\r\n\r\ncharges.   At that time my colleague, Mr Leong Horn  Kee,  in\r\n\r\nresponse   to   the  reply  from  the  Minister,   raised   a\r\n\r\nsupplementary  question which touched on the issue  of  price\r\n\r\nvolatility and how we could overcome it.  I believe the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nissue  of  fluctuation in prices of electricity  charges  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  cause  of concern to consumers.  In his  reply,  the\r\n\r\nMinister agreed that we do not want day-to-day fluctuation in\r\n\r\nprices  of  electricity charges as this may cause disturbance\r\n\r\nin the market.  The Minister had also agreed that, in theory,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Power  can  go into the futures  market  to  hedge\r\n\r\nagainst  price  fluctuation.  Sir, I think this  is  an  idea\r\n\r\nworth  pursuing  as the futures market is  a  mechanism  aims\r\n\r\nprecisely at preventing extremities in price fluctuation.  In\r\n\r\na futures market, forward contracts can be fixed at a certain\r\n\r\nprice  and the contract will be honoured irrespective of  the\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the oil prices.  Consumers, on the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nmust  be  educated in understanding that they  cannot  expect\r\n\r\nSingapore Power to supply power at low tariffs all the  time.\r\n\r\nWhat   they   can  expect,  however,  is  the  stability   of\r\n\r\nelectricity  prices.  Of course, the prices of oil  may  come\r\n\r\ndown after it has been hedged, such is the way of the market,\r\n\r\nif consumers want stability in electricity charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Minister to kindly consider\r\n\r\nlooking  seriously  at  oil  price  hedging  as  a  means  of\r\n\r\nstabilising the price of electricity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng):</b> Sir, Mr Chng Hee Kok\r\n\r\nraised  the issue of reinstatement of industrial property  to\r\n\r\nthe  original  condition  upon its  sale.   Reinstatement  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  property  to  the original  condition  is  not  a\r\n\r\nrequirement  for the transfer of JTC's industrial properties.\r\n\r\nHowever,  where  there  are  breaches  to  these  terms,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  when  unauthorised structures are  erected  in  the\r\n\r\npremises,  the  buyer  or seller must regularise  the  breach\r\n\r\nprior  to  the completion of transfer.  Otherwise,  JTC  will\r\n\r\nwithhold  consent.  JTC only requires companies to  reinstate\r\n\r\ntheir  premises upon returning them to JTC.  This applies  to\r\n\r\nboth tenancies and leases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng also mentioned that HDB's policy is more\r\n\r\nliberalised.   From  what  I  understand,  HDB's  policy   on\r\n\r\nreinstatement of industrial property is similar\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto JTC's.  It means that if there is a breach of lease terms,\r\n\r\nthey   have  to  reinstate  the  property  in  its   original\r\n\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann commented about the utilities charges.\r\n\r\nDue   to  rising  fuel  oil  prices,  we  had  to  raise  our\r\n\r\nelectricity tariffs three times last year.  Fortunately, fuel\r\n\r\noil  price  has  since eased.  Last month, tariffs  for  non-domestic  consumers were lowered.  However, we still  had  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  tariffs  for residential and  small  non-domestic\r\n\r\nconsumers  because Power Supply has not fully  recovered  its\r\n\r\nunder-collected  revenue from this group  of  customers.   If\r\n\r\nfuel oil price does not increase beyond its current level, we\r\n\r\ncan  expect electricity tariff for residential and small non-domestic consumers to come down slightly within the next  few\r\n\r\nmonths.  Fuel oil futures predict a decline in prices in  the\r\n\r\ncoming months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin also raised the issue whether it is possible to\r\n\r\nhedge against price fluctuation.  As the Minister replied  in\r\n\r\nJanuary to a parliamentary question that the players may also\r\n\r\nguess wrong, then consumers would also face problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, it is hard to imagine the breach\r\n\r\nincludes  things like painting of factory buildings,  pruning\r\n\r\nand  cutting overgrown vegetation, overhanging tree branches,\r\n\r\ntidying up the premises.

Changes  in fuel oil prices are passed  on  to  the\r\n\r\nconsumers,  which is fair.  Fuel oil makes up, as  my  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of State said, about half of the cost of  producing\r\n\r\nelectricity.  If oil prices increase after the review,  Power\r\n\r\nSupply  would have under collected its revenue.  But, on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, if oil prices decrease, Power Supply would  then\r\n\r\nhave over collected.  Power Supply is allowed to recover  its\r\n\r\nunder-collected  revenue or, alternatively,  is  required  to\r\n\r\nreturn  over-collected  revenue to  consumers  in  subsequent\r\n\r\nquarters.   Because this is done quarterly, it allows  us  to\r\n\r\nrespond to the changes in oil prices quickly.  We think  that\r\n\r\nthis is a very efficient way of responding to the changes  in\r\n\r\noil  prices.  But, where appropriate, we also try to moderate\r\n\r\nthe  price increases by staggering the increase over a longer\r\n\r\nperiod of, say, more than three months.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Time is catching up with us.

Besides physical earthquakes, the\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asian region is also vulnerable and prone to social\r\n\r\nand  political  earthquakes and upheavals.   These  political\r\n\r\nearthquakes  open  up  fault  lines  of  race,  religion  and\r\n\r\npolitical struggles of power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of the Asian financial crisis, the strategic\r\n\r\nlandscape  in Southeast Asia has not changed for the  better.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it has turned for the worst.  Southeast Asia  is  now\r\n\r\nat  the crossroads, buffeted by storms and whirlpools.   Many\r\n\r\nof  the  countries  in  the  region  are  in  the  throes  of\r\n\r\ntransition.   In  the Philippines, we have another  round  of\r\n\r\npeople's  power which ousted President Estrada.  In Thailand,\r\n\r\nwe  have  a change of government, and the new Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nMr  Thaksin,  narrowly escaped a bomb blast recently  at  the\r\n\r\nBangkok  airport.   In  Malaysia, there  are  also  political\r\n\r\nuncertainties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia, Sir, is not the same after Surharto.\r\n\r\nPresident  Abdurrahman Wahid is facing  increasing  pressures\r\n\r\nfrom inside and outside of Parliament, and some regions, like\r\n\r\nAceh, are seeking secession.  In Kalimantan, we have horrific\r\n\r\nreports  of Dayaks head hunting the Madurese.  No  one,  Sir,\r\n\r\nknows  for  certain what is in store for Indonesia.   In  the\r\n\r\nmidst of the upheavals and uncertainties in the region, it is\r\n\r\nfoolhardy  to  neglect defence.  Remember, when we  separated\r\n\r\nfrom Malaysia and became independent in 1965, we had only two\r\n\r\ninfantry  battalions; no artillery, no armour, no  Air  Force\r\n\r\nand no navy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore can stand tall and confident because we\r\n\r\nhave  a  strong SAF.  No one can bully us.  No one  can  just\r\n\r\nwalk  in and walk over us.  Any fund allocated to the SAF  is\r\n\r\nwithout doubt money well spent.  It is an investment  in  our\r\n\r\nsecurity: an insurance.  If there is no SAF, there would  not\r\n\r\nbe an independent and free Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam claims yesterday that we are\r\n\r\nspending too much money on defence and that we are giving too\r\n\r\nmuch  priority to defence.  He is mistaken.  He  should  read\r\n\r\nSun Tzu,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  famous strategist who wrote the classic 'Art of War'  in\r\n\r\nthe  4th  Century BC.  Sun Tzu tells us that  states  can  be\r\n\r\nundermined, subdued or conquered.  The only guarantee is wise\r\n\r\nleadership,  good strategy, robust defence  and  a  resilient\r\n\r\neconomy which can fund the defence expenditures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun Tzu proclaims that defence is a deadly serious\r\n\r\nbusiness, that ultimately decides the fate of states, and the\r\n\r\nfate  of the people.  In the very first paragraph of his 'Art\r\n\r\nof  War',  Sun  Tzu  says, \"Defence is  a  matter  of  utmost\r\n\r\nimportance to the state; it determines the life or  death  of\r\n\r\nthe state; the road to survival or ruin.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key to victory is, as Sun Tzu puts it, the use\r\n\r\nof  the right strategies.  And the ultimate aim of strategies\r\n\r\nis  to  overcome  an  opponent with  the  minimum  of  force,\r\n\r\nconquering   an   enemy  already  defeated   psychologically,\r\n\r\ndislocated or out manoeuvred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should therefore learn from Sun Tzu and never\r\n\r\nlet  our  guard down.  We must stand by and be ready for  any\r\n\r\nscenario.   We  must  monitor  the  events  and  developments\r\n\r\nclosely, scan the horizon, or the radar screens, and take the\r\n\r\nnecessary  precautions  and steps.   We  pursue  peace,  with\r\n\r\ngoodwill  to  all men.  But peace can only be  attained,  and\r\n\r\nmaintained, if we are able, ready, and has the will to defend\r\n\r\nour  homeland and our interests.  To have peace, we  must  be\r\n\r\nready  for  war.  It is a matter of deterrence.  As President\r\n\r\nTheodore  Roosevelt once said, \"speak softly, but  carry  the\r\n\r\nbig stick.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, defence is everyone's business. It is the business\r\n\r\nof  every  Singaporean.  It is total  defence.   Let  us  all\r\n\r\nsupport  defence  and  endorse the Defence  budget.   It  has\r\n\r\nalways been the cornerstone of Singapore's policy that  there\r\n\r\nshould be a balance of power in the Asian region.  We welcome\r\n\r\nin  this  context  the  presence of major  powers,  as  their\r\n\r\npresence  will help to balance the forces in the region,  and\r\n\r\nthereby maintain peace and security for all of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now have a Republican in the White House. We\r\n\r\nhope Singapore will enhance the good economic and defence\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nties  with  the United States, and President George  W.  Bush\r\n\r\nwill  keep the United States engaged in the region.  So  far,\r\n\r\nanalysts are not very clear about the position of the new  US\r\n\r\nAdministration,  and  the new steps or initiatives  President\r\n\r\nGeorge  W.  Bush  will take.  In this context,  therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask  the Minister on his assessment  of  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  situation in Southeast Asia and  the  role  of  the\r\n\r\nmajor powers in our region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 1989, Singapore has participated in a number\r\n\r\nof  peacekeeping  operations.   In  1999,  Singapore  sent  a\r\n\r\nmedical and logistical support team to East Timor, as part of\r\n\r\nthe  UN  peace-keeping mission.  I am sure such participation\r\n\r\nin  the  UN peace-keeping is much appreciated by all  parties\r\n\r\nconcerned, and the SAF officers and men have learned valuable\r\n\r\nlessons from such peace-keeping operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the situation arises, I hope MINDEF will consider\r\n\r\nother  requests  for  UN peace-keeping missions,  within  the\r\n\r\nlimits of our resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I propose to take the tea break now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and\r\n\r\ntook the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Certainly,  in  some\r\n\r\ncountries,  we have seen a rise in the level of  turmoil  and\r\n\r\nuncertainty within the population.  Not only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  we  seen  the  unusual replacement of  a  president  by\r\n\r\npopular  means,  we have also witnessed the senseless  ethnic\r\n\r\nviolence in rioting that has led to a needless loss of lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is taking place in these countries is, obviously,\r\n\r\nof concern to us here because of the possibility of the knock-on  effects.   These effects may be as diverse  as  providing\r\n\r\nhumanitarian  assistance  or  a  weakening  of  defence  ties\r\n\r\nbecause of a change of regime at the top.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further afield, I note with great interest that China\r\n\r\nhas   decided   to   increase  its  defence  spending   quite\r\n\r\ndramatically.   It seems that the decision  to  increase  its\r\n\r\ndefence  spending was motivated by its relations with Taiwan.\r\n\r\nThe   Allied   bombing  of  Kosovo  last  year,   it   seems,\r\n\r\nprecipitated  such  a  decision  to  increase   its   defence\r\n\r\nspending.   In  that campaign, the US was able to  pound  the\r\n\r\nYugoslav government into submission, without having  to  pour\r\n\r\nin  massive troops on the ground.  It dawned upon the Chinese\r\n\r\nthen  that  they  were  behind  the  West  in  leveraging  on\r\n\r\ntechnology to fight a modern war.  Since the US is willing to\r\n\r\nsell  advanced  weapons  to Taiwan, the  Chinese  were  quite\r\n\r\nrightly  concerned  with the strategic implications  of  such\r\n\r\nmilitary assistance.  Hence the build-up of arms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any build-up of arms is always a challenge to peace\r\n\r\nand  stability, particularly when it is set in a region where\r\n\r\nthe  parties have made it clear, in no uncertain terms,  that\r\n\r\nthey  would resort to arms conflict, if necessary, to resolve\r\n\r\ntheir differences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, it is our stated policy that we welcome\r\n\r\nthe  US  to  maintain  a  balance of  power  in  the  region.\r\n\r\nHowever, not everyone welcomes the US presence.  The Chinese,\r\n\r\nI  believe, are deeply suspicious of the assistance that  the\r\n\r\nUS  would provide in the event that the two Chinas do  battle\r\n\r\nto  settle their long-standing differences.  Having a  strong\r\n\r\nUS  presence  at their doorstep, and being in a  position  to\r\n\r\nintervene at short notice, would not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngive the Chinese government any comfort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, against the limited scenario that I have painted, I\r\n\r\nhave  a  number  of  questions to ask.   These  are:  Is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  ready to deal with the whole spectrum  of  issues\r\n\r\nthat may arise from the instability in the region?  Secondly,\r\n\r\nis  our  defence  relations with our neighbours  affected  by\r\n\r\nthese uncertainties?  Thirdly, will our continued strong ties\r\n\r\nwith the US affect our neutrality as a country and put us  in\r\n\r\na difficult position with mainland China?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore is strategically\r\n\r\nlocated at the heart or hub of Southeast Asia, with sea lines\r\n\r\nand lanes of communication radiating outwards from Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore straddles the access to the Straits of\r\n\r\nMalacca, the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, as well as\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian archipelago.  East-West trade from Europe and\r\n\r\nthe  Suez  Canal passes through India to Southeast Asia,  and\r\n\r\nonward to China and Japan in East Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These very sea lanes are not only our trade links, but\r\n\r\nalso  our  lifelines for food and essential  items  that  are\r\n\r\nimported  wholesale to sustain our population.  For the  sake\r\n\r\nof security, trade and essential supplies, we must keep these\r\n\r\nvital  sea lanes open and accessible to shipping and  passage\r\n\r\nat all times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from time to time, there are reports of piracy in\r\n\r\nthe  seas, as well as attempts by illegal immigrants to  land\r\n\r\non  our shores.  I would like to ask whether the SAF and,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, the Air Force and the Navy, have been  beefed  up\r\n\r\nto   meet  this  challenge  of  keeping  the  sea  lanes   of\r\n\r\ncommunication open.  And whether, in view of the  sea  change\r\n\r\nin  Southeast Asia and the resulting uncertainties, that such\r\n\r\nvital sea lanes would continue to be kept open.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of our limited resources, we cannot patrol the\r\n\r\nvast seas and the sea lanes entirely on our own.  Indeed, the\r\n\r\ncooperation  of the major powers would be necessary.

Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the events over the\r\n\r\nlast   few  months  highlight  that  the  regional  situation\r\n\r\ncontinues to be an uncertain one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big power rivalry continues in the Asia Pacific. The\r\n\r\nrecent   increase  in  China's  defence  budget   cannot   go\r\n\r\nunnoticed, and raises questions as to its long-term  policies\r\n\r\nand  ambitions in the region.  The recent visit by  President\r\n\r\nPutin  to Vietnam seeks to reinforce the view that Russia  is\r\n\r\nnot completely out of the race in Asia.  The change in the US\r\n\r\nadministration again raises the question as to the new policy\r\n\r\norientation of the US towards the Asia Pacific region.   Will\r\n\r\nthe  new Bush administration continue US involvement  in  the\r\n\r\nregion and maintain its military presence in Asia?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both North and South Korea have shown good improvements\r\n\r\nin  their  bilateral  relationship.  But uncertainty  in  the\r\n\r\nrelationship  continues.   The  China-Taiwan  issue   remains\r\n\r\nunresolved and sabre-rattling can be expected from China when\r\n\r\nthe  US arms sales to Taiwan is reviewed in April 2001.  Sir,\r\n\r\nnumerous  claims of sovereignty over disputed territories  in\r\n\r\nthe South China Sea still continue to plague the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these, political manoeuvering, greater regional\r\n\r\nautonomy, independence movements and ethnic clashes  continue\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia.  The threat of refugee outflow from  Indonesia\r\n\r\nis  there,  as  was  recently seen in Kalimantan.   That  the\r\n\r\nthreat is near can be seen in the recent troubles in the Riau\r\n\r\nIslands  when  riots broke out.  People power and  democratic\r\n\r\nchange  have  changed the political scene in the  Philippines\r\n\r\nand Thailand.  In Malaysia, the political situation is tense,\r\n\r\nand analysts are wondering how the government will respond to\r\n\r\nthe many challenges facing the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Defence to share\r\n\r\nwith us how MINDEF sees the regional security situation,  and\r\n\r\nas to how Singapore and the SAF are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprepared,  and positioned, to ride the tide in the  midst  of\r\n\r\nthis turmoil.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like to join\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues in the GPC for Defence and Foreign Affairs  in\r\n\r\nhighlighting the security outlook in Southeast Asia and  East\r\n\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Southeast Asia has seen disturbing developments, if not\r\n\r\nupheavals,  in recent times.  Even as they are smarting  from\r\n\r\nthe recession and the political turmoil in some countries, we\r\n\r\ncan  see continued problems that are cause for worry.  In the\r\n\r\npast  one  and  a  half  years,  there  have  been  political\r\n\r\nleadership   changes  in  Indonesia,  the   Philippines   and\r\n\r\nThailand.  There have also been leadership changes  in  major\r\n\r\ncountries  further  in  the East - in the  United  States  of\r\n\r\nAmerica and in Taiwan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China continues to threaten to use armed force if Taiwan\r\n\r\npursues  independence.  The mood for unification of  the  two\r\n\r\nKoreas  has excited a lot of people although, in reality,  it\r\n\r\nis not likely to happen in the near future and tension in the\r\n\r\npeninsula  could continue.  Then, there is also the  question\r\n\r\nof  whether  the new US administration would continue  to  be\r\n\r\nengaged, or more engaged, in Southeast Asia and East Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these in the background, there are possible\r\n\r\nuncertainties in terms of security in Southeast Asia and East\r\n\r\nAsia.

However, I would  like\r\n\r\nto ask the Minister\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether  there are any plans to strengthen FPDA  and  enhance\r\n\r\nthe quality of FPDA exercises.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I would like to make three\r\n\r\nrelated points on the issue of our defence relations with our\r\n\r\nneighbours  in  ASEAN.    The first  is  whether  the  recent\r\n\r\nfluctuations  in  our  relations with neighbouring  countries\r\n\r\nhave  affected  our  bilateral defence relations  with  them.\r\n\r\nRelations with neighbouring countries seem to be coloured  by\r\n\r\nthe   personality  of  leaders.   In  the  past  few  months,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  been sharply but wrongly  criticised  by  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian President, Mr Abdurrahman Wahid.  Has his outburst\r\n\r\nagainst  us  affected  defence  relations  between  our   two\r\n\r\ncountries?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has enjoyed close and warm relationship with the\r\n\r\nformer Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI).  Considering the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the armed forces in Indonesia has reduced influence  in\r\n\r\nthe   past  one  or  two  years,  do  we  still  enjoy   warm\r\n\r\nrelationships with the TNI, which is the successor  of  ABRI?\r\n\r\nWould  recent developments in bilateral relations affect  our\r\n\r\nair training facilities in Indonesia?  In the case of defence\r\n\r\nrelations  with Malaysia, would the Minister also  share  the\r\n\r\nprogress that we have made in our relations with Malaysia?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to the multilateral defence\r\n\r\nrelations,   the   Five  Power  Defence  Arrangement   (FPDA)\r\n\r\ninvolving  Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand  and  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom and, of course, Singapore.  Could the Minister inform\r\n\r\nthe  House  if  the  member countries  will  continue  to  be\r\n\r\ncommitted to the FPDA, considering the fact that some of them\r\n\r\nhave been facing budget constraints?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to defence diplomacy in general.\r\n\r\nWe  would  like to engage more countries in defence relations\r\n\r\nso that we can have enhanced relationship and defence network\r\n\r\nwith  them.   There has been a report in the  Jane's  Defence\r\n\r\nWeekly  last  December  about  the  interest  of  Vietnam  to\r\n\r\nestablish closer defence relations with Singapore.   Would we\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  take  up  the offer of  closer  relations  with\r\n\r\nVietnam?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, it has been our stated policy to\r\n\r\nmaintain  multilateral  and  bilateral  defence  ties  as  an\r\n\r\nintegral part of our defence architecture.  To this  end,  we\r\n\r\nmaintain  bilateral  defence ties  with  our  neighbours  and\r\n\r\nfriends  and  also  multilateral  ties  with  several   other\r\n\r\ncountries.  These ties have essentially served us  well.   We\r\n\r\nhave  been  able  to  leverage on them  to  procure  training\r\n\r\ngrounds  for the SAF and also to help deepen relationship  to\r\n\r\npromote peace and stability in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the sizeable number of defence ties which we have\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to maintain, perhaps, none is quite as  prominent\r\n\r\nand  well-established as the Five Power  Defence  Arrangement\r\n\r\n(FPDA)  which  was  started in 1971 with UK,  Australia,  New\r\n\r\nZealand  and  Malaysia.  Even after 30 years,  the  FPDA  has\r\n\r\nbecome one of the main pillars for defence arrangements.   As\r\n\r\nrecently as a couple of weeks ago, Britain reiterated that it\r\n\r\nwould  honour the FPDA and would defend Singapore should  the\r\n\r\nneed arise.  It is indeed reassuring to note the words of the\r\n\r\nDefence  Secretary, Mr Geoffrey Hoon when he said, \"I  cannot\r\n\r\nsee circumstances arising where if Singapore is attacked, the\r\n\r\nRepublic could not look to the United Kingdom for support  or\r\n\r\ncircumstances where we would not want to give that support.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the backdrop of the importance of the FPDA, we\r\n\r\nwere naturally concerned when Malaysia decided to reduce  its\r\n\r\nlevel  of  support some years ago, ostensibly on the  grounds\r\n\r\nthat it is facing constraints in the budget arising from  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis.  There were also some problems  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat were technical in nature and that hindered the extent of\r\n\r\ncooperation among the member countries of the FPDA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Sir, that Malaysia has since started\r\n\r\nparticipating  again  in  FPDA  exercises.   The   continuing\r\n\r\nparticipation  of  Malaysians in  the  FPDA  arrangements  is\r\n\r\nindeed  encouraging to all of us.  I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether the problems that we have with Malaysia  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the FPDA have been resolved and,  whether  going\r\n\r\nforward, we can expect the same level of commitment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom Malaysia with the rest of the other FPDA members.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, we have, since our independence,\r\n\r\nbeen  very  supportive and involved with the United  Nations.\r\n\r\nWe  have continued to contribute whatever support we could to\r\n\r\nthe continuance and strengthening of the United Nations.   In\r\n\r\nbecoming  a  member  of the United Nations Security  Council,\r\n\r\nSingapore  seeks  once  again to  contribute  to  the  United\r\n\r\nNations to serve in a capacity which is equal to its ability.\r\n\r\nIndeed, on the United Nations Security Council, Singapore has\r\n\r\nbeen   given   the   difficult  task  of  investigating   and\r\n\r\ninstituting sanctions against Liberia. The trouble spots  are\r\n\r\nincreasing  around the world as civil wars occur for  various\r\n\r\ngeographic, ethnic and religious reasons.  We see the  United\r\n\r\nNations  sorely  stretched in terms of cash and  manpower  to\r\n\r\ncope  with increasing demands for peace-keeping troops around\r\n\r\nthe  world.  Because of its small size, Singapore  has  given\r\n\r\nwhat  it  can in the past and, most recently, in  the  United\r\n\r\nNations  Peace-keeping Force in East Timor  in  the  form  of\r\n\r\nmedical and transport services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its current role in the UN Security Council, a\r\n\r\nresponsibility  which Singapore will hold for  the  next  two\r\n\r\nyears,  will  there be greater demands on us contributing  on\r\n\r\npeace-keeping   duties  through  the  United   Nations?    If\r\n\r\nexpectations  rise  due  to  Singapore's  membership  on  the\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council, will the contributions asked, in terms  of\r\n\r\ncash and manpower or both, be entertained or be responded  to\r\n\r\nby Singapore?  Would the Minister give some light to this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I rise on the same point on Singapore's\r\n\r\nparticipation in UN peace operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have participated in a number of these operations\r\n\r\nincluding those in East Timor and, where we have served,  our\r\n\r\npersonnel have received high marks for their preparation  and\r\n\r\nprofessionalism.  On Singapore's part, those who have  served\r\n\r\ndo  us  proud and also gained valuable experience.  I believe\r\n\r\nthat  we  should build on the experiences to do more  for  UN\r\n\r\npeace operations.  We cannot contribute\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmuch in absolute numbers compared to larger armies like those\r\n\r\nin  India  and  Pakistan.  I believe, however, we  could  add\r\n\r\nvalues in three ways and I encourage the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is the speed of our response. The United\r\n\r\nNations  sometimes experiences long delays  in  getting  firm\r\n\r\ncommitments  from  countries and further  delays  in  getting\r\n\r\npeople to the ground.  Singapore can be a small but rapid and\r\n\r\neffective  force in peace-keeping.  Second, in our  training.\r\n\r\nWe  should  work  with others to share in training  military,\r\n\r\npolice and other uniformed personnel for UN peace operations.\r\n\r\nAfrica  has  a  regional  institute for  training  in  peace-keeping.    Asians   should  consider   starting   one   too.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  ASEAN neighbours, like Malaysia, the Philippines\r\n\r\nand  Thailand,  have also served in UN peace operations.   We\r\n\r\nshould  train  together with them and  others  still  further\r\n\r\naway, like Australia, New Zealand and Japan.  Sir, I want  to\r\n\r\nemphasise here that I am not talking about military exercises\r\n\r\nbut training and exercises for peace-keeping.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like the Minister to consider is\r\n\r\nin  our  ability  to  integrate civilian  participation.   In\r\n\r\naddition   to   uniformed  personnel,  UN  peace   operations\r\n\r\nincreasingly require civilian participants.  This is  because\r\n\r\nof  the complex nature of peace operations that often involve\r\n\r\nreconstruction and administration, as we see in  East  Timor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,  they can benefit from preventive  actions.  In\r\n\r\nthese   cases,   civilian  administrators,  special   envoys,\r\n\r\nelection monitors and others play important roles.  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  a  good  Administrative Service  and  a  large  civilian\r\n\r\nreservist  population.  It is well-suited therefore  to  help\r\n\r\nprovide such participants from the civilian side for UN peace\r\n\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there would always be a limit as to how much we can\r\n\r\nhelp  but  I hope in terms of speed, preparation and training\r\n\r\nand   civilian  integration,  we  can  help  make  a  quality\r\n\r\ncontribution to UN efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> I rise to share the similar concerns\r\n\r\nof my colleagues, Mr Hawazi Daipi and Mr Simon Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore became a non-permanent member of the United\r\n\r\nNations  Security Council in October last year for  a  three-year  term.   As  a  non-permanent  member  of  the  Council,\r\n\r\nSingapore shoulders the expectations of one who occupies  the\r\n\r\ncentre  stage  in  the  international  scene.   Singapore  is\r\n\r\ntherefore expected to conduct itself in a manner that  befits\r\n\r\nitself  as  a  member of the Council.  One such  expectation,\r\n\r\nwhether  rightly  or  wrongly perceived,  is  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  also  play  a  bigger role  in  peace-keeping.   This\r\n\r\nexpectation  is  in  keeping with the increasing  numbers  of\r\n\r\npeacekeeping  missions  that  the  United  Nations  has  been\r\n\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last ten years, the United Nations has never been\r\n\r\nbusier.   From Balkans to Cambodia and East Timor, UN  forces\r\n\r\nhave  been  asked to monitor and maintain the  fragile  peace\r\n\r\nthat  was  brokered  under  its auspices.   In  this  regard,\r\n\r\nSingapore   has   played  its  part  as  a  member   of   the\r\n\r\ninternational  community in contributing to the peace-keeping\r\n\r\nefforts  of the UN.  We participated in peace-keeping efforts\r\n\r\nin  such  places as Kuwait, Cambodia and, most  recently,  in\r\n\r\nEast  Timor.   In all these places, our people on  duty  have\r\n\r\ndone us proud.  This has enabled us to fly our flags high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each peace-keeping mission is different and missions\r\n\r\nvary  in  form  and content.  In some cases,  UN  Forces  are\r\n\r\nconstantly caught up in a cross-fire in the front  line.   In\r\n\r\nothers, they are kept in the rear to maintain law and  order.\r\n\r\nSingapore's   participation  in  international  peace-keeping\r\n\r\nefforts has to date been confined largely to relatively  low-risk operations.  However, I do envisage that there would  be\r\n\r\na  time when we may be involved in operations that are  high-risk in nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister the following question:\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the  experience  that  we  have  learnt  from   our\r\n\r\nparticipation in peacekeeping efforts overseas and whether we\r\n\r\nare ready to participate in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhigh-risk peacekeeping operations should the need arise?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst,  I  would like to thank the Members of Parliament  for\r\n\r\ntheir valuable and pertinent comments on our defence policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have enjoyed another year of peace and stability. We\r\n\r\nhave  gone  through the economic crisis and emerged stronger.\r\n\r\nWe  can  take  pride  that as a nation we remained  cohesive,\r\n\r\nhelped  each  other  and took the bitter  medicine  that  was\r\n\r\nnecessary to enable us to recover quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience in the last three years, 1997-1999, will\r\n\r\nhelp  us  in the coming years.  It will not be smooth sailing\r\n\r\nahead.   The  economic situation in the region has  generally\r\n\r\nimproved.  But it is not yet clear what will happen to the US\r\n\r\neconomy  and  the  impact  this will  have  on  the  regional\r\n\r\neconomies, including Singapore's.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important lessons we learnt from the\r\n\r\nAsian  financial  crisis  was how  quickly  and  unexpectedly\r\n\r\nthings  can  take a turn for the worse.  We should  also  not\r\n\r\nforget  how  the  economic  crisis  quickly  developed   into\r\n\r\npolitical  crisis in some countries.  There was an  immediate\r\n\r\nand  devastating  impact on political  stability  and  social\r\n\r\norder and these effects continue to be felt in many parts  of\r\n\r\nthe region.  None of us can help but feel concerned about the\r\n\r\nrecent  destabilising events which we read in our  newspapers\r\n\r\nor watch on television.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Dr Ong Chit Chung has said, as a small country\r\n\r\nin  the middle of a rather turbulent region, Singapore  would\r\n\r\nbe  wise not to take our peace and security for granted.   We\r\n\r\nweathered the economic crisis well because our policies  were\r\n\r\nbuilt  on  a strong foundation.  And we will need  this  same\r\n\r\nstrong   foundation   to   see  us   smoothly   through   the\r\n\r\nuncertainties that lie ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important element in our defence policy is our\r\n\r\npeople  -  their will and cohesiveness, and their willingness\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto face reality, make tough decisions and implement difficult\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Another key element of this strong foundation is a\r\n\r\nstrong defence capability.  Without a credible defence force,\r\n\r\nwe  will  not have the political space or peace  of  mind  to\r\n\r\nfocus on economic growth.  We will not be able to secure  our\r\n\r\nfuture.  Nor will we be able to do our part to contribute  to\r\n\r\nregional peace and stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr Ravindran have\r\n\r\nasked  me  to  comment  on the security  environment  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   Sir,  last year, I told this House that  there  was\r\n\r\ngreater uncertainty in the regional security environment, and\r\n\r\nthe  developments  of  the past year  have  not  allayed  our\r\n\r\nconcerns.    How  relations between the new US Administration\r\n\r\nand Beijing work out will determine the climate for the whole\r\n\r\nAsia-Pacific.   A stable Sino-US relationship  is  vital  for\r\n\r\nregional peace and stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relations between Japan and the US, and between Japan\r\n\r\nand  China,  will also have a bearing on regional  stability.\r\n\r\nSingapore   wants   to  see  the  triangular   US-China-Japan\r\n\r\nrelationship  remain stable.  And we continue to  affirm  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of a US military presence for regional  stability\r\n\r\nand security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer home, there are political transitions in several\r\n\r\nregional countries.  Some of these transitions and leadership\r\n\r\nchanges  have been accompanied by considerable socio-economic\r\n\r\ndislocations  and  instability,  and  sometimes  even  by   a\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of  law  and order and bloodshed.   The  political\r\n\r\nforces  that  have been unleashed will take a  long  time  to\r\n\r\nsettle  down.  The unstable political and security  situation\r\n\r\nwill  make  economic  recovery even more difficult  for  some\r\n\r\ncountries,  as it has severely undermined investor confidence\r\n\r\nin this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these developments could have a more direct\r\n\r\nimpact  on  us.  The violence in the Malukus and  Kalimantan,\r\n\r\nfor example, triggered off an exodus of tens of thousands  of\r\n\r\npeople  fleeing  from  the violence.  Similar  outflows  from\r\n\r\nareas nearer Singapore would have a direct\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpact on us and on our neighbour, Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic hardships have also led to a significant\r\n\r\nincrease  in the number of illegal immigrants and a  rise  in\r\n\r\npiracy.   Fortunately  the SAF, working closely with the Home\r\n\r\nTeam,  has   done well to keep these problems from  affecting\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  spate of illegal immigrants   in  1998  was\r\n\r\nquickly   brought   under  control  after   we   stepped   up\r\n\r\nsurveillance and took tough action against those we caught.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piracy has risen in regional waters. But in the area in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Straits, where our Navy and Police Coast Guard\r\n\r\nconduct    coordinated   patrols   with   their    Indonesian\r\n\r\ncounterparts,  there  has been no report  of  piracy  or  sea\r\n\r\nrobbery since April 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, the political developments in\r\n\r\nregional countries have had an impact on their relations with\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We have been subjected to some criticisms,  even\r\n\r\nsome   intemperate   words  have  been   used.    These   are\r\n\r\nperturbations in our relations with our neighbours  which  we\r\n\r\nhave to manage with a combination of diplomacy and firmness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi Daipi has asked whether the more negative\r\n\r\nattitude  of  some quarters has had an impact on our  defence\r\n\r\nrelations.   Sir,  the  SAF's relations with  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nArmed Forces remain robust.  There is a substantial volume of\r\n\r\ncooperation  and interactions  -  some of which have  carried\r\n\r\non  uninterrupted for 20 to 30 years.  Both armed forces find\r\n\r\nthese  interactions to be of great benefit  for  professional\r\n\r\ndevelopment   as   well  as  for  building   friendship   and\r\n\r\nunderstanding,  and  both sides have  said  they  want  these\r\n\r\ninteractions to continue and be strengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have expressed concern about whether the\r\n\r\nSAF  is prepared to deal with low intensity security problems\r\n\r\nand  what  measures the SAF will take.  Sir, I  informed  the\r\n\r\nHouse  in last year's Budget debate that MINDEF and  the  SAF\r\n\r\nwill be working more closely with other Ministries and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagencies, in particular the Home Team, to prepare contingency\r\n\r\nplans  to deal with such problems.  I am happy to inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that we have made good progress in developing many  of\r\n\r\nthe  concepts,  frameworks and operational  plans  to  tackle\r\n\r\nissues involving low intensity conflict.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is not enough just to work out Singapore's\r\n\r\nown responses and contingency plans.  There also has to be  a\r\n\r\nstable environment.  This means working to achieve peace  and\r\n\r\nstability  around the world, and in our region in particular.\r\n\r\nWhen  regional peace and stability is threatened by  problems\r\n\r\nin  one country, recent history teaches us that international\r\n\r\neffort  is  sometimes  necessary.   The  involvement  of  the\r\n\r\ninternational  community in East Timor is one example.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  that we must work with other countries to develop  the\r\n\r\nstrength  and vitality of the international system,  both  on\r\n\r\nthe  security and economic fronts, with the aim of  promoting\r\n\r\npeace  and  stability.  And we must be  prepared  to  act  in\r\n\r\nsupport of this aim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations has a vital role to play in bringing\r\n\r\nabout a stable security situation in the region. The UN is an\r\n\r\nimportant  component of the international system which  helps\r\n\r\nenhance our security, because the UN plays a critical role in\r\n\r\npromoting   peace  and  stability  around  the  world.     We\r\n\r\ntherefore  strongly support the UN.  Here, our membership  of\r\n\r\nthe  UN  Security Council will give us more opportunities  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to international security.  There will  be  higher\r\n\r\nexpectations  of us to do more. Where we can contribute,  and\r\n\r\nin a way that is useful, we will.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a total of some 800 SAF personnel have been\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  12  UN  peace-keeping missions  over  the  past\r\n\r\ndecade.   Currently, the SAF is participating in  three  such\r\n\r\nmissions - UNIKOM at the Iraq-Kuwait border, UNTAET  in  East\r\n\r\nTimor, and UNMEE in Ethiopia and Eritrea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Mr Simon Tay that we are also\r\n\r\ncontributing  to the peace-keeping work of the  UN  in  other\r\n\r\nways. SAF officers share our training practices\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand   establish  networks  for  UN  peace-keeping  operations\r\n\r\nthrough peace-keeping seminars and training programmes.   And\r\n\r\nin  this spirit, Singapore would welcome a regional institute\r\n\r\nfor peace-keeping training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has also subscribed to the UN Standby\r\n\r\nArrangements  since  1997.   These Arrangements  enhance  the\r\n\r\nresponsiveness and effectiveness of UN peace-keeping efforts,\r\n\r\nand  we have committed planning officers, military observers,\r\n\r\nmedical personnel and police officers, as well as helicopters\r\n\r\nand  transport  aircraft  on  standby  for  UN  peace-keeping\r\n\r\nmissions.  We will continue to explore what other ways we can\r\n\r\nhelp  to  make  the  world and especially  our  region   more\r\n\r\npeaceful, stable and secure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides playing our role as a responsible member of the\r\n\r\ninternational  community, our security is  also  strengthened\r\n\r\nthrough  defence diplomacy.  Over the years, MINDEF  and  the\r\n\r\nSAF  have  developed a good network of bilateral  and  multi-lateral  defence  relationships.  Some  of  these  are  long-standing,  such as the Five Power Defence Arrangements  which\r\n\r\ncelebrates its 30th anniversary this year and is still  going\r\n\r\nstrong.   Some  are more informal in nature but  nevertheless\r\n\r\nvery  useful, such as the conferences and military  exercises\r\n\r\nwe  have organised to bring together many regional countries.\r\n\r\nAnd,  of  course, there is a very large number  of  bilateral\r\n\r\ninteractions and exercises which MINDEF and the SAF have with\r\n\r\ncountries,  not just in the Asia-Pacific but  also  in  other\r\n\r\nregions, notably Europe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our overseas training also helps us develop friendships\r\n\r\nand strong links.  Today, the SAF trains regularly in about a\r\n\r\ndozen countries all over the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a peaceful and stable strategic environment is\r\n\r\nbest  assured  by  several layers of  security:  firstly,  by\r\n\r\nhaving a strong international system under the United Nations\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  threats to peace and stability; secondly,  by\r\n\r\ndeveloping   the   regional  security  architecture   through\r\n\r\nbilateral  and  multi-lateral  arrangements  like  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nRegional Forum\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  the  FPDA;  thirdly, by promoting defence diplomacy  and\r\n\r\nfriendly  ties  with  all countries, including  Vietnam;  and\r\n\r\nfinally,  at  the  core, by building  a  strong  SAF  as  the\r\n\r\ncornerstone of our strategy of deterrence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have no control over what happens in other\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  this  is all the more  reason  for  constant\r\n\r\nvigilance  and  a  strong SAF.  There  is  a  wide  range  of\r\n\r\ncontingencies that we may have to deal with, and they may hit\r\n\r\nus, as we have evidence in the last few years, with little or\r\n\r\nno warning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing expertise and capabilities to deal with new\r\n\r\nsituations  and demands takes time and effort.   The  vision,\r\n\r\nplanning and prudent investment that we put in over the  last\r\n\r\n30-odd years have served us well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is a professional and capable force that is well\r\n\r\nregarded  and respected by others.  To tackle the  challenges\r\n\r\nahead,  we  must  continue  to invest  in  the  best  people,\r\n\r\ntechnology and equipment.  Defence technology remains  a  key\r\n\r\ncomponent  of  our efforts to strengthen the  SAF.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to invest in R&D to maintain our technological edge,\r\n\r\nboth  by  our  own  efforts as well as in collaboration  with\r\n\r\npartners in our universities and overseas.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF will also continue to invest in effective\r\n\r\nequipment  and weaponry that can best fulfil its missions   - whether  this is by upgrading existing equipment  and  weapon\r\n\r\nsystems  or  developing our own products to meet  our  unique\r\n\r\ndefence requirements, or procuring new equipment from foreign\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  when these best meet our needs.   However,  we\r\n\r\nmust remember that what determines a successful operation and\r\n\r\nvictory  on  the  battlefield is not so  much  technology  or\r\n\r\nequipment but the men and women who serve in the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF firmly believes in investing in people, and we\r\n\r\nhave always made it a priority to attract the best and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbrightest  by  offering  a  career that  is  challenging  and\r\n\r\nrewarding.  Over the past three years, we have developed  the\r\n\r\nNew  Partnership  schemes  for the  SAF  officer  corps,  the\r\n\r\nwarrant  officer  and  specialist corps,  and  MINDEF's  non-uniformed  personnel. These enhanced career  schemes  aim  to\r\n\r\nprovide first class careers to attract first class people  to\r\n\r\nwork in MINDEF and the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we work hard to develop the SAF's capabilities, we\r\n\r\nmust  never forget that the SAF is a citizens' army, and  the\r\n\r\nbulk of our strength comes from our NSmen and NSFs.  They are\r\n\r\nyour  average Singaporean, although what they do in  the  SAF\r\n\r\ncertainly puts them above the average Singaporean -  both  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  the capabilities they have developed  and  in  the\r\n\r\ncommitment and effort we expect of them.   MINDEF, and indeed\r\n\r\nall   Singaporeans,  recognise  their  contributions  to  the\r\n\r\ndefence of our nation.  MINDEF therefore convened RECORD III,\r\n\r\nchaired  by Minister of State David Lim, to address  many  of\r\n\r\nthe issues of concern to our national servicemen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, Singaporeans have since the earliest\r\n\r\ndays  of our independence, recognised the critical importance\r\n\r\nof  having a strong defence capability.  Dr Ong Chit Chung in\r\n\r\nhis  speech  has  said that a strong defence is  a  necessary\r\n\r\ninvestment  to  secure our future.  And I am  sure  that  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will share his sentiment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a strong defence capability is an investment\r\n\r\nwhich  requires  not only money but also the  hard  work  and\r\n\r\nsacrifice  of  all Singaporeans - not only  those  who  serve\r\n\r\nnational  service  but also their families  and  loved  ones.\r\n\r\nBuilding a strong defence force involves sacrifice.   But  it\r\n\r\nis  a necessary sacrifice.  Because, Sir,  without the SAF to\r\n\r\nsecure our peace and stability, Singapore has no future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have responded to many of the major points which\r\n\r\nhave been made by Members of Parliament.  My colleagues,  the\r\n\r\nSecond Minister for Defence and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister  of State for Defence, will deal with the  remaining\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I rise to encourage the Ministry to\r\n\r\nincrease  transparency in defence policies as  a  confidence-building  measure.   I do so because some mistakenly  believe\r\n\r\nthat defence policies should be shrouded in absolute secrecy.\r\n\r\nI believe history shows that to the contrary.  Conflict often\r\n\r\nresulted because one side did not know or understand what the\r\n\r\nother  side  was doing or intended to do, and  therefore  the\r\n\r\nlack   of  understanding  and  transparency  could  lead   to\r\n\r\nconflict.    Knowledge,  understanding   and   exchange   can\r\n\r\ntherefore help to lessen the chances of conflict.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) to which the Minister has\r\n\r\nreferred  is  now the leading multilateral security  dialogue\r\n\r\nfor  our  region.  The ARF has suggested that  defence  White\r\n\r\nPapers and security outlooks be published and exchanged.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  I  hope that we will play our part in  developing\r\n\r\ndefence  diplomacy  and  its  regional  institutions  a  step\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Armed Forces has already taken a\r\n\r\ncommendable step in this direction - a publication last year.\r\n\r\nMore,  however, can and should be done.  No state secrets  of\r\n\r\ncourse   need   to   be   given  away.    However,   reliable\r\n\r\ninternational  reports  and  publications  that  are   openly\r\n\r\navailable, such as Jane's, already give more than the  MINDEF\r\n\r\npublication  has  done.   I would ask MINDEF  to  participate\r\n\r\nfully  and enthusiastically in these initiatives and to  help\r\n\r\nset  the highest possible benchmarks for defence White Papers\r\n\r\nas well as other confidence-building measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir, Singapore actively participates in efforts to promote\r\n\r\ntransparency  and  confidence-building.   Indeed,   we   have\r\n\r\norganised activities and participated in initiatives  by  the\r\n\r\nARF   and   various  regional  countries  that  help  promote\r\n\r\ndialogue, understanding and cooperation among regional  armed\r\n\r\nforces and defence establishments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last year, as Mr Tay has said, we published\r\n\r\n\"Defending Singapore in the 21st Century\" which sets out  our\r\n\r\ndefence  policy  in some detail.  There are also  initiatives\r\n\r\nunder  ARF  auspices  to  exchange information  among  member\r\n\r\ncountries as a form of confidence-building.  Besides this, we\r\n\r\nalso  take  the opportunity to explain our defence policy  at\r\n\r\nvarious bilateral conferences and seminars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, transparency is not only about what is\r\n\r\npublished,  what we say, but, more importantly, what  we  do.\r\n\r\nThe  most  effective  way  to  promote  transparency  is   to\r\n\r\nencourage  more  interactions among  regional  armed  forces.\r\n\r\nMINDEF and the SAF hosted about 120 visits by senior military\r\n\r\nand  defence officials of a large number of foreign countries\r\n\r\nlast  year, that is more than two visits a week.  So  at  any\r\n\r\none  time, somebody is visiting us and we brief them and also\r\n\r\nfind  out more about them.  Many of these were visits to  SAF\r\n\r\nunits  and  bases  by  armed forces and service  chiefs.   We\r\n\r\nparticipated in about 80 bilateral and multilateral  military\r\n\r\nexercises,  that is about one-and-a-half a week  on  average.\r\n\r\nSo  we are always participating and working with armed forces\r\n\r\nof different countries all the time.  For instance, we hosted\r\n\r\nExercise Pacific Reach 2000, a submarine rescue exercise that\r\n\r\nbrought together more than 600 participants and observers and\r\n\r\nseveral  navies  in the Asia-Pacific region.  Singapore  also\r\n\r\norganised many conferences and forums, some of them under ARF\r\n\r\nauspices,   such  as  the  Combined  Humanitarian  Assistance\r\n\r\nResponse Training course which was attended by defence, civil\r\n\r\naffairs  and foreign affairs officials from 17 ARF countries.\r\n\r\nThen,  there  were  events such as the Millennium  Air  Power\r\n\r\nConference,  which  was  attended by air  force  chiefs  from\r\n\r\ncountries  all  over  the world.  Those defence  interactions\r\n\r\nhelp  participating  armed forces to  learn  more  about  one\r\n\r\nanother, thereby contributing to mutual understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, MINDEF and the SAF have taken practical steps\r\n\r\nto   promote  transparency  and  confidence-building  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.  The success of such efforts\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the contributions of all regional countries  and\r\n\r\nnot  just  Singapore alone.  And we will continue to  do  our\r\n\r\npart at a pace that others are also comfortable with.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I must applaud MINDEF for\r\n\r\nbuilding  nice and well-designed training camps, for example,\r\n\r\nthe  new  basic  military  training camps  at  Pulau  Tekong.\r\n\r\nVisitors  are  indeed very impressed by the new and  upgraded\r\n\r\nfacilities there.  Even the food, I dare say, is delicious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I hear lament from some old soldiers, the `Lau\r\n\r\nPing',  that the training is not what it used to be and  that\r\n\r\nthe  training has gone soft.  The old soldiers talk about the\r\n\r\ntimes  when they had to run up and down Peng Kang  hill  with\r\n\r\nfull packs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I hope the Minister will assure us that\r\n\r\nthe  training is no less rigorous and vigorous,  despite  the\r\n\r\nvery  nice  setting there, and our soldiers  are  as  fit  as\r\n\r\nfiddle, and have the fighting spirit or warrior spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that most operationally ready National\r\n\r\nServicemen take their in-camp training very seriously.   They\r\n\r\nare  prepared to make the sacrifices and take the disruptions\r\n\r\nto  their  careers  in their strides when they  go  for  such\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that they ask is that their time in training be used\r\n\r\nproductively.   What  they hate most is to  wait  around  for\r\n\r\ntheir slot for shooting at the range for a long time, or wait\r\n\r\nfor their transport, or hang around for the next phase of the\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask MINDEF if it can cut down such `idling'\r\n\r\ntime,  and  make  in-camp training even more productive,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps  some  in-camp  training  could  even  be  shortened,\r\n\r\nwithout forgoing quality or operational readiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in line with the advances in technology and changes\r\n\r\nin the political landscape, military threats have changed and\r\n\r\nevolved over time.  Besides full frontal attacks, we have  to\r\n\r\nprepare for chemical attacks, terrorist attacks, hijacks  and\r\n\r\nelectronic warfare, for example.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister if MINDEF and SAF have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  new  capabilities to deal with such  threats,  and\r\n\r\nwhether the SAF is ready operationally on D-day, whenever  it\r\n\r\nhappens, or when the chips are down.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, the SAF we have today is the\r\n\r\noutcome of years of investment in people and equipment.   The\r\n\r\nSAF is a modern and well-integrated fighting force with sound\r\n\r\ndoctrines.   It puts much effort and resources into  training\r\n\r\nand  it  is  operationally ready to deal with any contingency\r\n\r\nthat involves our national security.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we may be a conscript armed forces, the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who serve national service know that they are as\r\n\r\nimportant  a part of the SAF's capabilities as regulars.   So\r\n\r\nthey  take their training very seriously and they are  always\r\n\r\nheartened when they benchmark themselves against the seasoned\r\n\r\narmed forces that they exercise with and come out well.   And\r\n\r\nwe  have exercises with armed forces like the US Armed Forces\r\n\r\nat the National Readiness Centre and have come out quite well\r\n\r\ncompared  to regular US forces.  As the House is  aware,  the\r\n\r\nSAF  also  conducts regular mobilisation exercises to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  we  maintain  our high state of operational  readiness.\r\n\r\nAnd  I am happy to say that the turnout rate in the past  few\r\n\r\nyears  has  almost always surpassed 95% for the  mobilisation\r\n\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the SAF is basically made up of urban Singaporeans\r\n\r\nliving  in a relatively small island, we do give our soldiers\r\n\r\nexposure  to  a  wide  variety of  training  because  of  the\r\n\r\nextensive  training  facilities  or  opportunities  that  are\r\n\r\nprovided  to us by various friendly countries in  the  region\r\n\r\nand  beyond.  So our soldiers - our Air Force, Navy, and Army\r\n\r\n-  are  in  fact training all over the world, in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates, Australia, Thailand, Brunei, and elsewhere.  And they\r\n\r\nget a lot of operational experience both by rubbing shoulders\r\n\r\nwith  their  counterparts of other countries as  well  as  in\r\n\r\noperating in various types of climates and terrains, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis prepares them for a wide variety of contingencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have in recent years seen how the SAF\r\n\r\nsuccessfully executed a number of missions when  called  upon\r\n\r\nto  do so at short notice.  This was possible only because of\r\n\r\nour  operational readiness.  The more recent  missions  which\r\n\r\nthe SAF executed with distinction, and which all Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  familiar  with, include the evacuation  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfrom  Phnom  Penh and the recovery operations  following  the\r\n\r\nSilkAir  crash  in  Palembang, and our  participation  in  UN\r\n\r\nmissions, INTERFET and UNTAET in East Timor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF is geared to fight any external aggressor who\r\n\r\nmay  threaten Singapore's security and territorial integrity.\r\n\r\nBut  there  are  other  sorts  of  security  challenges  that\r\n\r\nSingapore may have to deal with, apart from these -  what  Dr\r\n\r\nOng  has mentioned, chemical, biological, electronic warfare,\r\n\r\nand  so  on, which our defence research institutes,  together\r\n\r\nwith  the  SAF, conduct research and equipping on contingency\r\n\r\nbasis  for our soldiers, so that we are prepared and we  know\r\n\r\nwhat  to  do  should such a threat arise.  But  we  are  also\r\n\r\npreparing  the SAF to deal with other forms of low  intensity\r\n\r\nthreats  which DPM Tan referred to earlier.  But such threats\r\n\r\ncannot  be  dealt with by the Ministry alone.   An  effective\r\n\r\nresponse  requires coordinated efforts of  all  the  relevant\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies,  and  the SAF  will  continue  to  work\r\n\r\nclosely  with  these  agencies  to  expand  our  spectrum  of\r\n\r\ncapabilities to deal with these security challenges.  We will\r\n\r\nalso  continue  to work with the international  community  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  such  potential threats do  not  undermine  our\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our camps may look comfortable and our food may be\r\n\r\ngood,  though not as good as the home-cooked food of Dr  Ong,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  had the opportunity to sample after his  invitation\r\n\r\nlast  year,  I  must  say  that the standard  of  operational\r\n\r\ntraining  and discipline is maintained.  So while  the  camps\r\n\r\nare  comfortable, they are designed for the soldiers to  rest\r\n\r\nwhen  they need to rest, so that they will be ready to  train\r\n\r\nvigorously  with  full intensity and with full  concentration\r\n\r\nwhen they need to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to thank the Minister\r\n\r\nfor his assurance that the SAF is fighting fit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that all National Servicemen would thank\r\n\r\nMINDEF  for  convening  Record III, the  Third  Committee  to\r\n\r\nRecognise the Contributions of Operationally Ready  NSmen  to\r\n\r\nTotal  Defence.  The recommendations of Record III  are  far-reaching indeed.  Here, I wish to highlight two areas which I\r\n\r\nbelieve have practical significance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top on my list is the exit permit control. Previously,\r\n\r\nNSmen  have  to apply for Exit Permits whenever  they  travel\r\n\r\noverseas.  Now, with Record III's recommendations, NSmen need\r\n\r\nonly  apply  if  they  travel overseas for  more  than  three\r\n\r\nmonths.  Moreover, a standardised multi-trip Exit Permit  has\r\n\r\nbeen introduced to cut down red-tape, and applications can be\r\n\r\ndone  online  via  Internet.  This would  save  us  time  and\r\n\r\neliminate all the hassle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know, as my sons now do not have to queue up\r\n\r\nevery  so  often  when they travel overseas  for  studies  or\r\n\r\nholiday,  and I do not have to follow them to  CMPB.   It  is\r\n\r\nquite a great relief to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other recommendation of significant value to NSmen\r\n\r\nis  the  award  of  bonus points for entry to  institutes  of\r\n\r\nhigher  learning.  Such bonus points are part  of  the  point\r\n\r\nsystem  for  co-curricular activities  (or  CCA)  and  is  in\r\n\r\nrecognition of NS contributions and performance.  May  I  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to elaborate on how the bonus points  will  be\r\n\r\nawarded and when will the scheme be launched.  Further,  will\r\n\r\nsuch a scheme place the ladies who do not do National Service\r\n\r\nat a distinct disadvantage?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to allowances for full-time National\r\n\r\nServicemen, we know that allowances are deliberately kept low\r\n\r\nand  are  not  meant  to be full-pay,  but  as  part  of  the\r\n\r\nsacrifice, as part of their service.  But I wish to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  if he would consider revising the NS allowance,  to\r\n\r\nkeep  pace with inflation, and to help families who are  hard\r\n\r\nhit by the economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing  me  to join in this debate.  I would also  like  to\r\n\r\nthank Dr Ong Chit Chung for saying half of the things which I\r\n\r\nwanted to say in this topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support most of the recommendations of Record\r\n\r\nIII, but would like to seek the Minister's response to a  few\r\n\r\nof the recommendations.  It was stated in the Report that the\r\n\r\nCommittee was mindful that golf courses take up land in  land\r\n\r\nscarce Singapore.  Nonetheless, it went on to recommend  that\r\n\r\na  new golf course be developed at a suitable site.  It is my\r\n\r\nhope  that  this  will  not be done at the  expense  of  more\r\n\r\npressing needs for the land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other recommendation, already mentioned by Dr\r\n\r\nOng,  was the need for clarification pertaining to the  award\r\n\r\nof  bonus  points  to  deserving  NSmen  for  admission  into\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of higher learning.  While this  proposal  will\r\n\r\nprovide  some  benefits and recognition  to  those  who  have\r\n\r\nperformed  well  during  National  Service,  will  it   place\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who are not eligible to serve NS, such as women,\r\n\r\nat a slight disadvantage?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, in-camp training for NSmen studying in\r\n\r\nlocal  institutions of higher learning is currently conducted\r\n\r\nduring  vacation  periods to minimise  disruptions  to  their\r\n\r\nstudies.   With  the  education system now  emphasising  more\r\n\r\nproject  works and industrial attachments during the vacation\r\n\r\nperiods, the current training cycle may need to be changed to\r\n\r\naccommodate  this  new  situation.   Now,  Record   III   has\r\n\r\nrecognised this problem and has recommended a review  of  the\r\n\r\nNS  training cycle for NSmen in local institutions of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning so that they will not be caught between the  demands\r\n\r\nof academic studies and NS training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would be grateful to hear the Minister's comments\r\n\r\non  these  points and also to ask whether the Government  has\r\n\r\naccepted all the other recommendations of Record III.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, as we have heard\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister, defence is placed high on  the  priority\r\n\r\nlist.  The Ministry of Defence has ensured that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nequipping  our  forces  with modern  and  high-tech  weaponry\r\n\r\nenhances  the  capabilities of our soldiers.   It  no  longer\r\n\r\nrequires  just  brawn but intelligence  to  be  an  efficient\r\n\r\nfighting  man.   The Minister also stressed on the  important\r\n\r\ncontributions  our  NSmen made.  I would like  to  propose  a\r\n\r\nscheme whereby the efficiency of our NSmen can be maintained,\r\n\r\nyet the period spent under NS is shortened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most schools offer their students a chance of joining\r\n\r\nthe uniformed group as the National Cadet Corps.  In the NCC,\r\n\r\nstudents  are  trained  in  the basics  of  military  skills,\r\n\r\nincluding weapon handling.  It does not take much to  upgrade\r\n\r\nNCC  training to cover the scope for basic military training.\r\n\r\nIf  this  is done, enlisted men who have spent at  least  two\r\n\r\nyears  in  the  NCC could be considered for much  shorter  or\r\n\r\nrevamped  basic  military training.  It may  be  possible  to\r\n\r\nshave  off  a  few months from their overall  NS  commitment.\r\n\r\nTraining under National Service should be intensive and  less\r\n\r\ntime  consuming.  To a great extent, men can be prepared  for\r\n\r\nNational  Service by having them to join the  NCC  and  being\r\n\r\nprovided with pre-NS training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to needing less time under NS, our men would\r\n\r\ntreat  military training as just a normal process since  they\r\n\r\nstarted training while still schooling.  Such a scheme  could\r\n\r\nstart  from  Secondary 3.  Those who continue into  JC  level\r\n\r\ncould  be provided with a wider scope of training to  prepare\r\n\r\nand  test them as potentials for accelerated promotion to the\r\n\r\nranks of non-commissioned officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time spent under NS can be maximised with such a\r\n\r\nscheme.  Enlisted men would already be familiar with military\r\n\r\ntraining  and the terminology used.  Having the basics  under\r\n\r\ntheir  belt,  they  can go straight into a  higher  level  of\r\n\r\ntraining.   They  would thus require less time  to  be  fully\r\n\r\ntrained soldiers and can be released sooner to complete their\r\n\r\ntertiary  education.   A  shorter NS  commitment  would  also\r\n\r\nreduce  the disadvantage men face, in terms of time loss,  as\r\n\r\ncompared to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  female contemporaries.  I hope that the Ministry could\r\n\r\ngive some consideration to this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> First, I would like to thank the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  for paying tribute to the  contributions  of\r\n\r\nNational Servicemen to the defence of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our full-time National Servicemen are the frontline\r\n\r\nsoldiers ever ready to defend Singapore.  The small allowance\r\n\r\nthat  MINDEF pays to National Service full-time men is  often\r\n\r\ninadequate  and the family usually supplements the  allowance\r\n\r\nto  allow the young men to have a quality of life that  their\r\n\r\nstation  in life requires.  However, not all National Service\r\n\r\nfull-time young men are as fortunate to be supported by their\r\n\r\nfamily  members.  There are many who struggle on  the  meagre\r\n\r\nNSF  allowance.  I have known cases where the young  man  had\r\n\r\ngone  on  AWOL as he could not support the family on the  NSF\r\n\r\nallowance and he had to go and seek employment to support his\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the allowance NSF are paid is a matter that must be\r\n\r\nreviewed regularly as the allowance is often inadequate.  The\r\n\r\nlast  review  was  done  some years  ago.   I  am  sure  that\r\n\r\ninflation  and  the  cost of living have gone  up  for  these\r\n\r\nallowances to be reconsidered.  I would ask the Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence  when MINDEF intends to review the NSF allowance.   I\r\n\r\nalso like to call upon the Minister to increase the allowance\r\n\r\nsubstantially  so  as to allow the young men,  who  sacrifice\r\n\r\ntheir youth for their country, to enjoy a decent standard  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am rising\r\n\r\nalso  to speak about allowance for NSF men.  The subject  has\r\n\r\nbeen  brought up, I think, with some regularity during Budget\r\n\r\ndebates  and,  in 1996, I remember Dr Wang Kai Yuen  detailed\r\n\r\nthe  proposal for the payment of an amount equivalent to  the\r\n\r\nemployer's  and employee's CPF contribution,  at  that  time,\r\n\r\namounting  to  40% on an approximation of an office  worker's\r\n\r\nstarting  salary of $1,000 into CPF account for our full-time\r\n\r\nNSmen.  The fees were reviewed and increases in the allowance\r\n\r\nhad been very much on the basis of financial hardship,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nparticularly,  for those NSF men who have to  support  family\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am bringing up the matter again this time in view of\r\n\r\nan  additional consideration which surfaced during the recent\r\n\r\nintensive discussions that we have been having on the subject\r\n\r\nof  the family, specifically encouraging our young people  to\r\n\r\nget  married and settle down earlier.  Surveys conducted have\r\n\r\nconsistently indicated that, among the top reasons, our young\r\n\r\nmen and women delay getting married is to say that until they\r\n\r\ncan  afford to have a home of their own.  A scheme,  such  as\r\n\r\nthat  proposed  by  Dr  Wang, that  starts  building  up  CPF\r\n\r\nbalances  for the young men as they discharge their full-time\r\n\r\nNS  obligation  would make a significant difference  and  how\r\n\r\nsoon  young  couples  are  able to  afford  that  downpayment\r\n\r\ntowards the home of their own that would start them off on  a\r\n\r\nlifetime together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From previous responses from the respective Defence\r\n\r\nMinisters, each time has been largely to remind us that NS is\r\n\r\na  responsibility  and an obligation of all male  Singaporean\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  that the philosophy is that  some  element  of\r\n\r\nsacrifice  is expected.  The men are not considered  salaried\r\n\r\nemployees and their allowance is meant only to cover some  of\r\n\r\ntheir basic daily expenses since their accommodation and food\r\n\r\nare  already  provided  in camp.  I am  not  at  all  arguing\r\n\r\nagainst   the  principle  that  NS  is  indeed   a   national\r\n\r\nresponsibility and obligation.  I would submit, however, that\r\n\r\nin our current very fast paced environment, the commitment of\r\n\r\n21/2 years in service to the nation with the consequent delay\r\n\r\nin  completion of studies or of starting up in a career is in\r\n\r\nitself already a significant sacrifice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore ask the Minister once again if he will\r\n\r\nreview the allowance for NSmen, in particular, with a view to\r\n\r\nmaking some payment into CPF accounts for the men, regardless\r\n\r\nof  the fact that it will be on an allowance, and not in  the\r\n\r\nusual manner, on a salary?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would also\r\n\r\njoin  my colleagues, Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Ravindran  and  Dr\r\n\r\nJennifer Lee, in asking\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  review NS allowance as well  as  make  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.  I agree with them that it will not just  help\r\n\r\nfamilies.    It   will  also  help  in  our  pro-family   and\r\n\r\nprocreation  policies.  The fundamental thing is that  people\r\n\r\nhave  already sacrificed and made a contribution and I  think\r\n\r\nwe  should not make them lose out, in terms of opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe  other  arguments  which I have  have  already  been  put\r\n\r\nforward quite eloquently by my colleagues.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.44 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Sir, we have heard this afternoon arguments reiterated as to\r\n\r\nthe   importance  of  the  SAF,  in  particular,  given   the\r\n\r\nuncertainty facing us in the security outlook in the  region,\r\n\r\nand  we  have  also  heard that National  Servicemen  are  an\r\n\r\nimportant backbone of the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our National Servicemen are not reserves. They are\r\n\r\nfrontline  soldiers.   They  are trained  in  a  spectrum  of\r\n\r\noperations  and,  if  called  upon,  they  must  be  able  to\r\n\r\nundertake whatever missions or tasks that are given to  them.\r\n\r\nIt  is  for  this  reason that we convened, once  again,  the\r\n\r\ncommittee  to  look at how we can recognise and  enhance  the\r\n\r\ncontribution of National Servicemen to defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RECORD III was convened last year. It comprised members\r\n\r\nof   the   public   from   grassroots  organisations,   NSmen\r\n\r\nthemselves,  as well as their spouses, and some hon.  Members\r\n\r\nof  this House.  We took a consultative approach, we even had\r\n\r\npeople  email ideas and suggestions to us, and we  had  focus\r\n\r\ngroups talking to National Servicemen to seek their inputs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process culminated in a set of recommendations,\r\n\r\nwhich  were  announced last month.  I would like  to  put  on\r\n\r\nrecord,  as Chairman of the Committee, my thanks to  all  who\r\n\r\nparticipated  in  this process.  MINDEF,  together  with  the\r\n\r\nrelevant ministries and organisations, is now studying RECORD\r\n\r\nIII's proposals, and announcements will be made as and when\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndetails  have been worked out.  We hope to implement as  many\r\n\r\nof the recommendations as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me take the opportunity this afternoon to\r\n\r\ndeal with a number of issues that Members have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On exit control measures, RECORD III has recommended the\r\n\r\nrelaxation of exit control measures to make it convenient for\r\n\r\nNSmen  and  their families to travel overseas  for  work  and\r\n\r\nleisure.  Some of the recommendations are that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The passports of Singaporean males who are between\r\n\r\n11 and 161/2 years old be extended by two years, or up to the\r\n\r\nage  of  161/2,  whichever is earlier.  These  are  for  pre-registrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The passports of Singaporean males who are above\r\n\r\n161/2 years old, up until the time when they are enlisted, be\r\n\r\nextended by one year.  These are the registrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The passports of full-time national servicemen be\r\n\r\nextended by up to 10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. A standardised multiple-trip exit permit be\r\n\r\nintroduced to replace the various types of exit permits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Singaporean males who are 11 years old and above,\r\n\r\nand  have  yet to enlist for full-time National  Service,  be\r\n\r\nbonded  by  deed,  rather  than  monetary  bond,  when   they\r\n\r\naccompany their parents on overseas employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF recognises that, with increased travel, both for\r\n\r\nwork  and leisure, these are practical measures, and we agree\r\n\r\nin  principle  to these recommendations.  The  implementation\r\n\r\nagencies, including Singapore Immigration, CMPB and MHA,  are\r\n\r\nnow working out the implementation details and we hope to  be\r\n\r\nable to put these measures into effect within a month or two.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Charles Chong has also raised the issue of the\r\n\r\nNS  training cycle for NSmen who are in universities.   It is\r\n\r\ntrue\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  we had tried to schedule NS training, in-camp call-ups,\r\n\r\nduring  the  university vacations.  But with changes  in  the\r\n\r\neducational  system,  more  and  more  project   work   being\r\n\r\nintroduced during vacation period, NSmen often write  in  for\r\n\r\ndeferments  so  that they can do their projects  or  take  on\r\n\r\nspecial   tasks   and  assignments.   This   is   disruptive,\r\n\r\nespecially when we try to keep our NSmen together in the same\r\n\r\nunit  as  they  progress through their 13  years  of  in-camp\r\n\r\ntraining  cycle so that we build up the bond and  camaraderie\r\n\r\namongst the men.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RECORD III has recommended that the NS training cycle\r\n\r\nfor NSmen studying in institutes of higher learning (IHL)  be\r\n\r\nreviewed, to help them manage both their academic studies and\r\n\r\nNS  responsibilities.  NS call-ups could be synchronised with\r\n\r\nspecific vacation periods, when no academic programmes  would\r\n\r\nbe  conducted,  so that NSmen can go for NS training  without\r\n\r\naffecting their studies.  In addition, the longer NS call-ups\r\n\r\ncould  be  confined to the vacation period during the  second\r\n\r\nyear  of  studies, so as not to clash with the more intensive\r\n\r\nthird and fourth years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the idea is that we would agree with the three\r\n\r\nuniversities, to take a time slot in the second year, so that\r\n\r\nNSmen  can  all go for their training during this  period  of\r\n\r\ntime.   MINDEF  is  now  working with these  universities  to\r\n\r\nimplement  this  recommendation, and we target  to  introduce\r\n\r\nthis new arrangement by next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of comments have also been raised\r\n\r\nconcerning  the award of NS points for university  admission.\r\n\r\nRECORD  III has recommended awarding NS points for university\r\n\r\nadmission,  in  recognitiion  that  NS  contributes  to   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  desirable  qualities,  eg,  leadership   and\r\n\r\nteamwork,  in  the  same  way that  co-curricular  activities\r\n\r\n(CCAs)  in  the  school do.  This is in line with  MOE's  new\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission  system, in which university  admission\r\n\r\nbonus  points will be awarded for students' participation  in\r\n\r\nCCAs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong and Dr Ong asked whether the awarding\r\n\r\nof  such points would be unfair to the females.  Let  me  say\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  now  working  closely  with  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  and  the  local  universities  to  evaluate   this\r\n\r\nrecommendation.  It will not be unfair to the females, but it\r\n\r\nwould be fair to the males.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, National Service is an important period in a\r\n\r\nperson's life.  During the two and half years of his service,\r\n\r\nthere  are  many  opportunities for a person  to  demonstrate\r\n\r\nqualities that will help indicate whether he can successfully\r\n\r\nundertake and benefit from a university education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What RECORD III is proposing is that if a person has\r\n\r\nperformed  well  in National Service, and has displayed  such\r\n\r\nqualities,  then  this  is  one  of  the  factors  that   the\r\n\r\nuniversities  should take into account  in  deciding  on  his\r\n\r\nsuitability for admission.  This should help the universities\r\n\r\nobtain  a  more  holistic  appreciation  of  the  applicant's\r\n\r\nabilities.  The bonus points awarded for NS will be given  in\r\n\r\nproportion  to how well they do and how much they  contribute\r\n\r\nduring  National Service.  Of course, the universities  would\r\n\r\nhave to balance the various factors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, MINDEF will consider RECORD III's recommendations\r\n\r\nfor bonus points, but on the basis that such points should be\r\n\r\nsubject  to the overall cap that the student could earn  from\r\n\r\nCCA  in  school.  With this, Members can be assured that  the\r\n\r\nrecommendation   seeks  to  recognise  good  performance   in\r\n\r\nNational  Service, and it will not disadvantage  the  others.\r\n\r\nBoth,  those  who may not do National Service or girls,  have\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to participate actively in the schools in the\r\n\r\nCCAs  and,  where they show the qualities of  leadership  and\r\n\r\nteamwork  and  the other qualities that the CCAs  attempt  to\r\n\r\nmeasure, they will also be eligible to get the maximum number\r\n\r\nof bonus points so that it would not be unfair to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, for males who serve full-time National Service,\r\n\r\nthey   enter   the  job  market  later  than   their   female\r\n\r\ncounterparts.  Awarding NS bonus points to them is a  way  to\r\n\r\nrecognise their contribution\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand sacrifice.  It also recognises that NS develops desirable\r\n\r\nqualities, just as those that the CCAs try to promote in  the\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF, MOE and the local universities will announce\r\n\r\ndetails of this soon, once they have completed their study.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Charles Chong has asked about the new golf\r\n\r\ncourse  and  why  this is necessary.  RECORD  III  made  this\r\n\r\nrecommendation because it recognises that the existing  SAFRA\r\n\r\nResort  and Country Club is very well utilised.  SAFRA Resort\r\n\r\nand  Country  Club  was  opened  in  1994  to  recognise  the\r\n\r\ncontribution of NSmen to Total Defence.  Today, it has 10,000\r\n\r\nmembers,  which, compared to private clubs, is several  times\r\n\r\nthe  order of membership that a club normally has, given  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  holes  in  the  golf  course.   Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nutilisation  rate of this course has increased  from  79%  in\r\n\r\n1994  to  91%  in  1999.   So, golfing facilities  today  are\r\n\r\nheavily utilised and there is often a very long waiting queue\r\n\r\nfor  people  who  want to play.  It is in this  context  that\r\n\r\nRECORD III recommended that another golf course be built  for\r\n\r\nNSmen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if land is going to be allocated for golf courses,\r\n\r\nthen  NSmen  should be given priority in recognition  of  the\r\n\r\nimportant  role  they play in Total Defence.   The  new  golf\r\n\r\ncourse  could be developed at a suitable location where  land\r\n\r\nuse would be optimised.  MINDEF will examine this proposal in\r\n\r\ngreater detail before announcing its decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, once again, I would like to thank Members for their\r\n\r\ninterest and support for RECORD III's recommendations, and to\r\n\r\nnote  that  MINDEF  would continually strive  to  improve  NS\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  administration, as well as the  NS  training\r\n\r\nsystem,  to better recognise and enhance the contribution  of\r\n\r\nour NSmen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may now turn to the issue raised by Mr Gerard\r\n\r\nEe  and  also touched on by Dr Ong Chit Chung on NS  training\r\n\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gerard Ee has suggested that participation in certain\r\n\r\nuniformed  groups, in particular, the NCC and the PCC,  could\r\n\r\nhelp  to shorten the training period during National Service,\r\n\r\nfull-time.   MINDEF recognises that participation  of  school\r\n\r\nstudents  in  uniformed groups prepares them for the  rigours\r\n\r\nand  discipline of military training.  It creates  a  certain\r\n\r\nmindset  in  them;  once they wear a uniform,  and  they  are\r\n\r\nsubject  to  discipline.  But we do not  think  that  we  can\r\n\r\nshorten  the  period of NS because of such participation,  as\r\n\r\nmilitary training deals with substantially different  skills.\r\n\r\nEven  for  the  NCC  or PCC, the kind of training  that  they\r\n\r\nundergo is quite different from the military training  during\r\n\r\nNS, which is at a standard and level much more demanding than\r\n\r\nthat expected or possible within these uniformed groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During Basic Military Training, recruits are taught a\r\n\r\nwide  range  of basic military skills, apart from handling  a\r\n\r\nrifle  and  shooting,  field-craft,  drills,  manoeuvres   at\r\n\r\nplatoon, company and battalion levels.  Beyond BMT, they  are\r\n\r\nassigned to operational units, where they learn to fight as a\r\n\r\nteam.   Development of esprit de corps amongst themselves  is\r\n\r\nalso part of the unit training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we recognise that, wherever possible, we want to\r\n\r\nkeep  as short as possible the time in National Service.   So\r\n\r\nMINDEF  has  a  scheme  where we reduce  by  two  months  the\r\n\r\nNational  Service  duration  of males  who  have  attained  a\r\n\r\ncertain  level of physical fitness, and this be  set  at  the\r\n\r\nsilver  standard  for the NAFA test.  This scheme  encourages\r\n\r\nstudents   to  keep  fit  through  various  means,  including\r\n\r\nparticipation in CCAs, such as sports, athletics or uniformed\r\n\r\ngroups.   Those  who fail to meet the fitness  standards  are\r\n\r\nbrought  in, as per schedule, and are put through a  rigorous\r\n\r\nPhysical  Training  Phase  before  they  join  their   fitter\r\n\r\ncounterparts in Basic Military Training.  Those who  pass  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  to undergo this Physical Training Phase, and  they\r\n\r\nthen have their NS period reduced by two months.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, may I reiterate that the 2 to 21/2 years\r\n\r\nof  National  Service brings a fresh recruit to the  required\r\n\r\nlevel  of  military proficiency to be a part of an  effective\r\n\r\nfighting   force   and  is  necessary  for  the   operational\r\n\r\neffectiveness of the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the matter of allowances raised by Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran, Dr Jennifer Lee, Mr Thomas Thomas and Dr Ong  Chit\r\n\r\nChung.  They have asked whether a review will be done for the\r\n\r\nallowances that we pay to full-time National Servicemen.  The\r\n\r\nshort answer is yes, but, before I go into the longer answer,\r\n\r\nlet me restate the principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental principle is that National Service is a\r\n\r\nduty  to be performed by all male Singaporeans.  It is a duty\r\n\r\nthat  is  necessary, as Dr Jennifer Lee has pointed  out,  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  our  country, our home and  our  families.   As  a\r\n\r\nservice rendered to the nation, it cannot be equated  with  a\r\n\r\nregular  salaried  job.   But  it  is  their  commitment  and\r\n\r\nsacrifice that ensure our continued peace and stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, because National Servicemen are not salaried\r\n\r\nemployees, they are not paid market wages.  They are given an\r\n\r\nallowance  for  personal upkeep.  Most of them stay  in-camp,\r\n\r\nthey  are given a comfortable bed, as Dr Ong has pointed out,\r\n\r\nand rather good food now.  In fact, the food has improved  so\r\n\r\nmuch  that  some  of  the canteens have started  to  complain\r\n\r\nbecause  their business has gone down.  So their basic  needs\r\n\r\nare  taken care of.  The allowance, therefore, covers  things\r\n\r\nlike transport and some incidental expenses.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF reviews this NS allowance regularly, taking into\r\n\r\naccount inflation and cost of living.  Their allowances  were\r\n\r\nlast  adjusted in 1996 by between $40 and $60.  A review  was\r\n\r\nconducted  again  in  1999 but no adjustment  was  made  then\r\n\r\nbecause  cost  had not gone up significantly since  the  1996\r\n\r\nreview owing to the economic downturn.  MINDEF, however, will\r\n\r\nreview  the  NS allowance again this year and  on  an  annual\r\n\r\nbasis to keep pace with changes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the cost of living.  The current review will be completed\r\n\r\nand its outcome known by the third quarter of this year.   So\r\n\r\nI hope we will have some news for you then.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas and Dr Jennifer Lee also asked whether\r\n\r\nwe   could   make  CPF  contributions,  even  if  they   were\r\n\r\nallowances.  This crosses the line on the principle that  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions are really made only for salaries and  not  for\r\n\r\nallowances.  Nevertheless, full-time national servicemen  can\r\n\r\nstill benefit from CPF top-ups.  And indeed, during the Share\r\n\r\nOwnership   Top-up  exercises  and  the  recent  CPF   top-up\r\n\r\nexercise,  MINDEF has assisted full-time national  servicemen\r\n\r\nwho  might  not  have enough money to open CPF  accounts  and\r\n\r\noffered  interest-free loans to those who  are  eligible,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they could make their own contribution to CPF in  order\r\n\r\nto receive the CPF top-up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the issue raised by Dr Jennifer Lee about the\r\n\r\nimpact   of  national  service  on  marriages  and   starting\r\n\r\nfamilies,  this  does take two to two and a half  years  away\r\n\r\nfrom  more time socialising and finding partners.  But  these\r\n\r\nare  two  separate  issues.   National  service  is  for  our\r\n\r\nnational  security.  Strong families are also for  our  long-term  development  as a society. Both are important,  but  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  mix  the two up.  Increasing  NS  allowances  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate earlier marriages is not appropriate, as  it  goes\r\n\r\nagainst  the principle of national service being a  duty.   A\r\n\r\nfull-time  national serviceman should not be compensated  for\r\n\r\nthis  reason.  But the Government does help young couples  in\r\n\r\nother ways.  For example, there is a CPF Housing Grant Scheme\r\n\r\nto   help   young  couples  who  are  first-time   applicants\r\n\r\npurchasing HDB flats and I think we should leave it at that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me touch on the general point about\r\n\r\nfamilies  that  may face financial hardship because  sons  or\r\n\r\nspouses  are  called  up to do national  service.  MINDEF  is\r\n\r\nmindful  of this and we have a number of schemes to  help  NS\r\n\r\nmen  whose  families  face particularly  difficult  financial\r\n\r\nhardships.  We offer both grants as well as loans  and  there\r\n\r\nare a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnumber of such cases every year.  If any Member of this House\r\n\r\nknows  of such a case, please refer it to MINDEF and we  will\r\n\r\nlook into the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to thank the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  for his reply.  But just as a matter of clarification,\r\n\r\nunder  the  law, allowances are CPF payable unless  they  are\r\n\r\nexempted.  But  I  take the Minister's  point  that  national\r\n\r\nservice  allowance is actually part of our service and  duty,\r\n\r\nand  that we should have an element of sacrifice.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree with the Nominated Member that we use this to build  up\r\n\r\nthe CPF reserve of our national servicemen or to help start a\r\n\r\nfamily.   I think they are quite different things altogether.\r\n\r\nThe  element  of sacrifice should still remain. What  we  are\r\n\r\nasking  is  revision  of  the allowance  to  keep  pace  with\r\n\r\ninflation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1999 and 2000 Budget debates, my GPC raised\r\n\r\nthe  issue of compliance with financial regulations  and  the\r\n\r\nAudit  report  by  the Auditor-General  on  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence.   I am afraid this year we have to raise  again  the\r\n\r\nobservations  of  the Auditor-General on  MINDEF's  financial\r\n\r\nprocedures for FY1999/2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the Auditor-General, there was\r\n\r\ninadequate control on advance payments to MINDEF's suppliers,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  a  total of $1.1 billion advance  payment  not\r\n\r\nbeing reported to the Auditor-General's office.  The Auditor-General  states  that  he has no assurance  that  MINDEF  has\r\n\r\naccurate information on the total amount of advances standing\r\n\r\nto  its  credit  at  any point of time.  The  Auditor-General\r\n\r\nstates  that MINDEF's accounting officer submitted a  listing\r\n\r\nof  405 accounts in May 2000, but later changed it to a total\r\n\r\nlisting of 411 accounts.  Further, the Auditor-General points\r\n\r\nout  that  the opening fund balances of 70 accounts  did  not\r\n\r\ntally  with the closing balances, with one account  having  a\r\n\r\ndifference of $139,783. The Auditor-General highlighted  that\r\n\r\nthere  were  serious irregularities in advances  given  to  a\r\n\r\ncompany and that between June 1998 and June 1999, the advance\r\n\r\nof  $2.13 million exceeded requirements by $645,000 to  $1.13\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Auditor-General reports that Audit test checks\r\n\r\nat  three  camps on records of meals supplied, revealed  many\r\n\r\ndiscrepancies  between the camps' records and the  suppliers'\r\n\r\ninvoices  of  the  number  of meals consumed.   The  Auditor-General further observes that there were many alterations  to\r\n\r\nthe  camps' documents which were not properly endorsed. There\r\n\r\nwas  also  over-payment  for food supplied  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\npayment  made  on  higher prices and not on tendered  prices.\r\n\r\nThere was also misappropriation for the sub-imprest at a  SAF\r\n\r\ncamp and misappropriation from a unit fund of a SAF camp.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in the public interest to seek clarification\r\n\r\nfrom  MINDEF on the report of the Auditor-General.  Again,  I\r\n\r\nurge  MINDEF  to take all the necessary actions  and  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  preventive  measures  to ensure  that  all  procedures\r\n\r\ncomply with the financial regulations of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the Auditor-General, in its Report\r\n\r\nfor  the  year 1999/2000, has once again highlighted  certain\r\n\r\nfinancial  lapses and irregularities in the accounts  of  the\r\n\r\nSAF.   Last  year, as a Member of this House,  I  raised  the\r\n\r\npoint  that MINDEF needs to pay greater attention as  to  how\r\n\r\nfinancial matters are handled within the SAF and as  to  what\r\n\r\nMINDEF will be taking in terms of steps in ensuring that such\r\n\r\nfinancial lapses and irregularities do not occur.   The  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  SAF has once again been picked up in the  Auditor-General's  Report causes concern to me as a  Member  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I would like to seek the assurance of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Defence  on the measures  or  steps  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence will be taking to ensure that such lapses\r\n\r\nand irregularities do not occur again, particularly when some\r\n\r\nof the sums of money which have been highlighted as being the\r\n\r\nmatter in question involve substantial amounts of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I have very little to add to\r\n\r\nwhat  has  already  been  said by  the  Chairman  and  Deputy\r\n\r\nChairman  of the GPC for Defence.  I would just like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister if any of the discrepancies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncited  in the Auditor-General's Report are similar or  repeat\r\n\r\ndiscrepancies that had been picked by the Auditor-General  in\r\n\r\nprevious years?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> May I, first of all, thank Dr Ong Chit\r\n\r\nChung  for  pointing  out  that allowances  may  attract  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions. I had spoken too quickly.  Indeed,  what  I\r\n\r\nshould  have said was that treating NS allowances  like  an\r\n\r\nemployment salary  and introducing CPF  contributions  would\r\n\r\ninvolve a major change in the philosophy and principles  of\r\n\r\nthe NS allowance which, as you have agreed, is an allowance\r\n\r\nand not a salary, and that is the principle that we defend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the Members for the questions on the Auditor-General's Report and the opportunity to clarify the issues\r\n\r\nand the steps taken to deal with them.  The Auditor-General's\r\n\r\nReport   for  FY1999/2000  contains  seven  observations   on\r\n\r\nadministrative  lapses, and two cases of fraud  committed  by\r\n\r\none  serviceman.  The two cases of fraud are the more serious\r\n\r\nand let me deal with that first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two cases involve two accounts. One is a\r\n\r\npetty cash account and the other is the unit welfare account.\r\n\r\nThe supervising officer of these accounts had failed to check\r\n\r\nall  payments of proper documentation and invalidated all the\r\n\r\nsupporting   documents  after  payment  in  accordance   with\r\n\r\nMINDEF's  procedures.  As a result, the  account  holder  was\r\n\r\nable  to  misappropriate about $93,400 from the two  accounts\r\n\r\nthrough  fictitious  claims  and recycling  of  invoices  and\r\n\r\nreceipts.   The  investigations also  revealed  that  another\r\n\r\n$44,000  was  unaccounted for due to improper  documentation.\r\n\r\nMINDEF  intends to take the account holder and other officers\r\n\r\nresponsible for these losses to task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that we note that these two cases\r\n\r\nwere  not  the  result of systemic failure  in  the  internal\r\n\r\nsystem of checks and controls.  These were in place.  Rather,\r\n\r\nthey  were  due to negligence and fraud.  The account  holder\r\n\r\nhas  been  charged and was sentenced to 15 months'  detention\r\n\r\nand  fined  $3,000.   He also returned a sum  of  $84,000  to\r\n\r\nMINDEF and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMINDEF  will  recover the balance of $9,400  from  him.   The\r\n\r\nsupervising  officer has also been charged for negligence  in\r\n\r\ndischarging his responsibilities and fined $1,500.  These two\r\n\r\ncases  would  be widely publicised internally as a  deterrent\r\n\r\nmeasure  and  also  as  a  lesson for all  staff,  especially\r\n\r\nsupervisory   officers,   to  take   their   responsibilities\r\n\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their audit on contracts with advance payments, the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General had reported that MINDEF did not  inform  his\r\n\r\noffice  of 90 contracts with advance payments totalling  $1.1\r\n\r\nbillion.   The Auditor-General had therefore stated  that  it\r\n\r\nhad  no assurance that MINDEF had accurate information on the\r\n\r\ntotal  amount of advance standing to its credit at any  point\r\n\r\nin  time.  Let me assure the House that the $1.1 billion  was\r\n\r\nfully  accounted for at all times by MINDEF.   All  contracts\r\n\r\nare   individually  monitored  and  tracked  by   procurement\r\n\r\nofficers  who  keep  a  record  of  the  outstanding  advance\r\n\r\npayments.   The  errors in the report to the  Auditor-General\r\n\r\noccurred  because  the data on advance  payments  had  to  be\r\n\r\ncomplied  within  the two-week deadline set by  the  Auditor-General at the onset of the audit.  As a result, a number  of\r\n\r\ncontracts  were inadvertently omitted during the  compilation\r\n\r\nprocess.   So  this was a compilation error.  We  have  since\r\n\r\nadopted  the Auditor-General's recommendation that  quarterly\r\n\r\nconsolidated  reports  on  outstanding  advance  payments  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted to the Permanent Secretary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other irregularities observed in the Auditor-General's Report were due to administrative lapses. MINDEF\r\n\r\nhas  taken  actions to rectify them. Let me again assure  the\r\n\r\nHouse that in none of these other cases were there any moneys\r\n\r\nlost or any moneys unaccounted for.  But let me just touch on\r\n\r\none other case that Dr Ong has raised about our cook houses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make mention of this because of the\r\n\r\nparticular wordings in the Auditor-General's Report that  may\r\n\r\nmislead some Members as to the severity of the discrepancies.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Auditor-General's Report, words to the  effect  that\r\n\r\nsome of the mistakes had been \"covered\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nup\" had been used.  This really referred to two discrepancies\r\n\r\nin  the  cook house records.  One was that in keying  in  the\r\n\r\ndata  into  the  system, a clerical error had  been  made  by\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the wrong list of items. This resulted  in  an\r\n\r\noverpayment of $3,478 out of a total contract value  of  $434\r\n\r\nmillion.  In context, this is a relatively small amount  but,\r\n\r\nnonetheless, it was an error.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concerned human errors in keeping records in\r\n\r\nthe  cook  house.   When  Audit  queries  were  raised,  some\r\n\r\npersonnel made the corrections on the records with correction\r\n\r\nfluid   instead  of  following  the  standard   practice   of\r\n\r\ncancelling the errors and initialling against the amendments.\r\n\r\nTherefore, they literally covered up their mistakes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a very serious criminal offence to cover up.\r\n\r\nMINDEF investigated the cases cited by Audit and is satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  there  was no evidence of cover up or falsification  of\r\n\r\nany  documents.  It was a case of inappropriate  response  to\r\n\r\nthe  errors or omissions pointed out by Audit.  In any  case,\r\n\r\nit  does not make sense for anyone to attempt to cover up  an\r\n\r\nerror  after  it  has already been detected by  the  Auditor-General.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me say also that since last year, MINDEF has\r\n\r\nembarked   on   a   comprehensive   review   of   the   major\r\n\r\nadministrative  processes involving finance, procurement  and\r\n\r\nlogistics.   This review is chaired by a Permanent Secretary.\r\n\r\nWe  will  continue to improve our controls  and  educate  our\r\n\r\nstaff  to  be more careful and vigilant in discharging  their\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  We will also continue to inculcate in  our\r\n\r\nstaff the importance of striving for zero defects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me thank the Members for their\r\n\r\nconcerns raised, and ensure them that MINDEF will continue to\r\n\r\nbe vigilant and prudent in its financial management.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to thank the Ministers\r\n\r\nfor their very comprehensive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nanswers and also the Minister of State for his assurances  on\r\n\r\nthe  audit.

The Singapore Armed Forces enjoys  tremendous\r\n\r\nsupport   from  the  public,  as  it  is  both   a   credible\r\n\r\norganisation  with  a credible deterrent capability,  and  it\r\n\r\nenjoys tremendous support on the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like the RSAF to address the issue of\r\n\r\nRSAF   aircraft's  loud  noise  over  residential  parts   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The affected areas include parts of Jurong  West\r\n\r\nand  Sengkang.  Many of the residents living in  these  areas\r\n\r\nhad  purchased their homes, hoping to return to a home for  a\r\n\r\npeaceful  rest  or  to study.  However, the regular  aircraft\r\n\r\ntraining schedules of the RSAF have become a serious nuisance\r\n\r\nto  residents  in  these two estates.   Many  residents  have\r\n\r\ncomplained  that  they are unable to tolerate  the  extremely\r\n\r\nloud noise levels emitted as aircraft fly at low altitude  to\r\n\r\nland at the nearby airbases.  Some residents have stated that\r\n\r\nthey  can  even  see the pilots' faces as  they  fly  by.   I\r\n\r\nsympathise   with  these  residents,  as  I  have  personally\r\n\r\nwitnessed the loud noise generated during these RSAF training\r\n\r\nstints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my speeches to my residents, I usually highlight\r\n\r\nto them that they should show the thumbs up to the pilots.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBut  I fear that when they are irritated by a noise, they may\r\n\r\nshow the thumbs down to the pilots, and that may not motivate\r\n\r\nthe  pilots.  I would like to ask the Minister whether  there\r\n\r\nis  regular  consultation between the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment and MINDEF prior to the development  of  new  HDB\r\n\r\nestates.  If yes, then why were new HDB estates built on  the\r\n\r\napproach path of these RSAF aircraft?

MINDEF is  aware\r\n\r\nof  the  problem  of aircraft noise, as  I  am  sure  is  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development and I am also sure that they\r\n\r\ndo take this into account when planning new housing estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RSAF has done what it can to reduce aircraft noise\r\n\r\nover  the  years.   It  has  taken many  concrete  steps.   A\r\n\r\nsignificant reduction in the noise problem has been  achieved\r\n\r\nwhen  the  RSAF  relocated  some  of  its  flying  activities\r\n\r\noverseas.  However, the RSAF still needs to conduct  day  and\r\n\r\nnight  flying  to  familiarise  our  pilots  with  the  local\r\n\r\nairspace  environment and to maintain operational  readiness.\r\n\r\nDue  to our country's limited airspace, it is inevitable that\r\n\r\nRSAF  aircraft  has to fly over some residential  areas.   In\r\n\r\nparticular, night training is important because it gives  our\r\n\r\npilots an important edge and it gives the RSAF combat options\r\n\r\nthat  it otherwise would not have.  I know that night  flying\r\n\r\ncontributes  particularly to noise disturbances,  because  at\r\n\r\nnight  the  ambient  noises are low, and  the  RSAF  aircraft\r\n\r\nnoises are therefore accentuated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RSAF has introduced other measures to reduce\r\n\r\naircraft  noise.  Where possible, flight simulators are  used\r\n\r\nfor training.  A hush house was built in 1984\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  the  conduct of engine runs by RSAF and  ST  Engineering\r\n\r\nAircraft.   To  further reduce noise pollution, the  aircraft\r\n\r\ndeparture  and  recovery  procedures  and  routes  have  been\r\n\r\namended, and minimum height requirement has also been imposed\r\n\r\non all RSAF aircraft over built up areas.  So if the Member's\r\n\r\nresidents  can still see the faces of the pilots, please  let\r\n\r\nme know.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also strict regulations prohibiting night\r\n\r\nflying  after 2300 hours, unless there are valid  operational\r\n\r\nreasons   to   do  so.   And,  finally,  being   mindful   of\r\n\r\nexaminations,  RSAF scales down its local  flying  activities\r\n\r\nduring  the  end of the year school examination  period,  and\r\n\r\ncoordinates  closely with the Ministry of Education  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  when students are doing their oral  examinations,\r\n\r\naircraft is not flying overhead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I certainly hope that MINDEF can do\r\n\r\nmuch  more  than  that, and I look forward to measures  along\r\n\r\nthose lines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $7,090,000,000 for Head K ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $730,000,000 for Head K ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head I -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the\r\n\r\nMain Estimates be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government compensated the telecommunication\r\n\r\ncompanies  about  $2  billion for accelerating  the  pace  of\r\n\r\nliberalisation  of  the industry.

The Government has\r\n\r\ncome  up  with a proposal of setting a reserve price for  the\r\n\r\nauctioning of the four new third generation telecommunication\r\n\r\nlicences.  Will the Minister enlighten the House on the state\r\n\r\nof the preliminary evaluation and the justification for still\r\n\r\nsticking  to the announced reserve price to the participants?\r\n\r\nBearing  in  mind that the level of investment the successful\r\n\r\nbidder will have to fork out to abide by the rules, which can\r\n\r\nrun  into tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars,  and\r\n\r\nthe  speed  at  which the technology in this  field  can  get\r\n\r\nobsolete very fast, will the Minister not consider going  for\r\n\r\na  lower  reserve price plus a royalty percentage on turnover\r\n\r\nto  lower the risk for the participants?  This can also lower\r\n\r\nthe  restrictive development of the industry in  the  future,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  high capital cost and minimise the risk  of  any\r\n\r\ndisruptive technological change for the industry players.  It\r\n\r\ncan  also lead to more participation in the auction with  the\r\n\r\nlikely   promise  of  more  customer-oriented  service   and,\r\n\r\npossibly,  more competitive business which it is intended  to\r\n\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, 3G technology\r\n\r\nforms   an   important   bridge  to   the   future   wireless\r\n\r\ntelecommunication service.  In my view, the speed with  which\r\n\r\n3G  service  is developed and how pervasive it becomes  would\r\n\r\ndetermine  whether  Singapore will  become  the  hub  of  the\r\n\r\ndigital economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced that it has decided to\r\n\r\naward  3G  licences  by  auction.  Awarding  3G  licences  by\r\n\r\nauction is like the award of COEs.  The Government will  rake\r\n\r\nin  huge sums of money.  Perhaps the Government is envious of\r\n\r\nthe  bonanza  that  the British and French  governments  have\r\n\r\nobtained  for  their auctions of 3G licences.  The  rationale\r\n\r\nfor  the Government to award 3G licences  through auction  is\r\n\r\nthat  the prices could be  determined by market forces.   But\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  important reason is that the Government would  like  to\r\n\r\nmake a big profit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market competition is not entirely rational. The end\r\n\r\nresult  will  be  that through auctioning the  licences,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment amasses a big sum of money, but the companies that\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  bidded for the licences are saddled  with  high\r\n\r\ncost thereby delaying the development of such technology,  as\r\n\r\nthey are too expensive and was beyond the reach of people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the auction, has the Government considered\r\n\r\nhow it will make use of the 3G technology and its application\r\n\r\nto   attract  new  investments  to  Singapore?   Apart   from\r\n\r\nauctioning  and the \"beauty contest\" method, as suggested  by\r\n\r\nsome players in the market, has the Government considered the\r\n\r\npossibility   of   cooperating  with  the   telecommunication\r\n\r\ncompanies to jointly develop the 3G technology and popularize\r\n\r\nthe related markets?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, Mr Chay Wai Chuen has\r\n\r\nasked about the process of telecommunications liberalisation,\r\n\r\nand  has  asked  for an update on the new entrants  who  have\r\n\r\nentered  into  the market, what sort of investments  and  how\r\n\r\nhave the consumers benefitted from the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Members will recall, we want to transform\r\n\r\nSingapore  into a competitive telecommunications hub  with  a\r\n\r\nmulti-player,  multi-network  environment  that   can   offer\r\n\r\ninnovative, high quality and cost effective telecommunication\r\n\r\nservices.   In  the  process, both business  and  individuals\r\n\r\nshould benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the one year since the liberalisation took place, I\r\n\r\nthink we have realised much of the desired benefits.  Let  me\r\n\r\ngive  Members some update.  We have awarded licences to  over\r\n\r\n200  telecommunication companies in the last one year.  There\r\n\r\nare  now  a  total  of 16 new and existing  Facilities  Based\r\n\r\nOperators (FBOs) and 195\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnew Services Based Operators. The new companies include world-class  players like MCI Worldcom, GlobalOne, UUNet  and  Asia\r\n\r\nGlobal  Crossing.  All these companies together will help  to\r\n\r\nimprove    the    variety   and   the   richness    of    the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications services and quality in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of investment, I think the telecommunication\r\n\r\nliberalisation  will  definitely result  in  significant  new\r\n\r\ninvestments  and jobs for Singaporeans.  We expect  that  the\r\n\r\ncapital  investment over the next 5-6 years will  exceed  S$3\r\n\r\nbillion, of which about S$2.2 billion will be realised within\r\n\r\nthe  next  2-3  years.  The new licensees will  create  about\r\n\r\n4,500  jobs  by  end of this year.  So the  results  and  the\r\n\r\nbenefits are going to be quite immediate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new telecommunication players will boost our\r\n\r\ninternational connectivity by 400 times by the  end  of  this\r\n\r\nyear,  to  over 20 Tb per second.  Our Internet data  centres\r\n\r\nare projected to increase by 750% to 1.5 million sq ft by the\r\n\r\nend  of  this year alone, compared to March 2000.   Within  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  nine months, we are going to see a huge increase.\r\n\r\nWith   such   rapid  and  vast  developments,  Singapore   is\r\n\r\ndefinitely fast becoming a leading hub for telecommunications\r\n\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has this benefited us? All sectors of the economy\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  have benefited from our increased connectivity\r\n\r\nand  enhanced  telecommunications facilities.  Companies  now\r\n\r\nhave a wide choice of telecommunications service providers to\r\n\r\nchoose  from in order to meet their global telecommunications\r\n\r\nneeds.   The  competitive telecommunications environment  has\r\n\r\ntherefore  made  Singapore also a more  competitive  business\r\n\r\nhub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very high voice and data traffic is helping us to\r\n\r\nbecome  a strong and vibrant info-communications hub.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult, we are now able to attract a vibrant cluster of infocomm  players across the entire digital value chain and  many\r\n\r\nof  them are hubbing their operations in Singapore, to  serve\r\n\r\nnot just the Singapore market\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbut  also  the regional market.  These new companies  include\r\n\r\ncontent   creators,   aggregators   and   hosters,   portals,\r\n\r\napplication  services  companies,  systems  integrators,   e-business  solution providers, web enablers, server farms  and\r\n\r\nInternet data centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the consumer level too, the benefits are quite\r\n\r\nevident.   IDD  rates have fallen by 60% on average,  and  in\r\n\r\nsome  cases, as much as 80%.  There is also a greater variety\r\n\r\nof  IDD call services, including voice over Internet Protocol\r\n\r\n(VoIP), and IDD aggregators, who help consumers find the best\r\n\r\nprice  and  quality  plan at any particular  point  in  time.\r\n\r\nConsequently, IDD calls have increased by over 20%,  to  over\r\n\r\n100 million minutes every month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will conclude by saying that our\r\n\r\ntelecommunications liberalisation has clearly been effective.\r\n\r\nIt   has   accelerated  the  development  of   our   national\r\n\r\ninformation  infrastructure,  and  our  regional  and  global\r\n\r\nconnectivity.   I will expect our economy and our  people  to\r\n\r\ncontinue   benefiting   from   the   opening   up   of    our\r\n\r\ntelecommunications sector in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the two cuts on the 3G auction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay has asked for a preliminary evaluation as to why\r\n\r\nwe  are  sticking  to the old reserve price  and  whether  we\r\n\r\nshould  instead lower the reserve price but include in  it  a\r\n\r\nroyalty  element, and that this will help to lower  the  risk\r\n\r\nfor  the investors, and in the process you may get also  more\r\n\r\nbidders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our assessment as to whether we should stick to a\r\n\r\nreserve price or go with a mix of a lower reserve price  plus\r\n\r\na  royalty  component  is that whatever upfront  charges  you\r\n\r\nimpose,  plus royalty or without royalty, the operators  will\r\n\r\ntypically  charge the consumers based on what the market  can\r\n\r\nbear, because the competition in the 3G market is going to be\r\n\r\nvery,  very tense.  And not only that, the 3G operators  will\r\n\r\nalso  have to compete with the present 2G operators in  terms\r\n\r\nof  voice, in terms of some of the data traffic.  As such,  I\r\n\r\nthink whether we charge only an upfront fee\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  a  combination of both, it will not likely influence  the\r\n\r\ncharges to the consumers when the 3G service is launched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is true that if we are able to lower the\r\n\r\nupfront  charges, it will help to lower the risk element  for\r\n\r\nthe  operators.  But, on the other hand too, by lowering  the\r\n\r\nrisk  element for the operators, it may also lead to a lesser\r\n\r\noutcome  for the consumers.  You may ask why.  The reason  is\r\n\r\nthat  when  they pay totally upfront, I think  operators  are\r\n\r\nincentivised to roll out their systems as quickly as possible\r\n\r\nand  to also roll out as many services as possible, in  order\r\n\r\nto  be able to recoup their upfront investments as quickly as\r\n\r\npossible.   So  there are pros and cons.  These are  elements\r\n\r\nwhich the other countries, which have auctioned out their  3G\r\n\r\nlicences,  have been considering.  And I think  in  the  end,\r\n\r\nmost of the countries have opted for an upfront fee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of whether we should stick to the announced\r\n\r\nreserve price of $150 million, IDA has definitely been making\r\n\r\na review of this issue.  We recognise that much of the global\r\n\r\ntelecommunications     environment,     the     international\r\n\r\ntelecommunications environment, has changed over the last six\r\n\r\nto nine months.  The market sentiment has definitely weakened\r\n\r\nand  there  is  also a greater uncertainty over the  business\r\n\r\ncase  for  3G.  In Europe, because of the high 3G  prices,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the telecommunications companies have also suffered  a\r\n\r\ndowngrading  of their investment ratings.  As a result,  they\r\n\r\nare also finding some difficulty in getting funding for their\r\n\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have taken all that into consideration and we have\r\n\r\nalso consulted our economic consultants who have done another\r\n\r\nstudy for us as well, in order to confirm our own findings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the assessment is that the market value of 3G\r\n\r\nlicences  has  dropped considerably.  As a  result,  IDA  has\r\n\r\ndecided  to lower the reserve price to bring it in line  with\r\n\r\nthe  current international levels.  The new reserve price  is\r\n\r\nnow  going  to be $100 million per licence, instead  of  $150\r\n\r\nmillion.  The auction will proceed as scheduled in late April\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has accused the Government of going\r\n\r\nby  the  auction route in order to rake in money and that  we\r\n\r\nare envious of the high auction bids in Europe.  Sir, this is\r\n\r\nfar from what the Government's intention is.  In fact, when I\r\n\r\nannounced the decision to award 3G licences, I think that was\r\n\r\ndone in probably September last year or so, I had stated very\r\n\r\nclearly that it is not the Government's intention to use  the\r\n\r\n3G  licences and the auction process as a means of maximising\r\n\r\nrevenue  for the Government.  What we are looking  for  is  a\r\n\r\nmechanism  that  will   allow us  to  award  3G  licences  to\r\n\r\ncompanies  which  value it most.  If Mr  Low  can  propose  a\r\n\r\nbetter  system than the auction system in order to award  the\r\n\r\nlicences, we would be very happy to hear about it.  And I  am\r\n\r\nsure  consultants all over the world will be very happy  too,\r\n\r\nbecause  this is an exercise which has occupied the minds  of\r\n\r\nmany consultants and even professors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consensus so far has been that the auction process\r\n\r\nis  the  most efficient mechanism for a few reasons.  One  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  3G technology is still unproven, no 3G  system  is\r\n\r\noperational  yet,  and therefore the true  potential  is  not\r\n\r\nknown  to regulators.  Even operators, I think, are not fully\r\n\r\naware  of  what the 3G potential is going to be, because  the\r\n\r\ntechnology  is  changing so fast, that what is possible  next\r\n\r\nyear  may be obsolete the year after.  Therefore, it is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult for the regulators to try to put a value on what  a\r\n\r\n3G licence should be, and therefore we should leave it to the\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our intent is to make sure that we have viable and\r\n\r\nvibrant 3G operators in Singapore.  Therefore, we should make\r\n\r\nsure  that  we  do not cripple them by having a high  licence\r\n\r\nfee,  and  that is why we went through a very deliberate  and\r\n\r\ncareful process of trying to determine what the reserve price\r\n\r\nshould  be.   As I have stated just now, we have reviewed  it\r\n\r\nand  recognising  that the market has changed,  we  have  now\r\n\r\nreduced the reserve price to $100 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has also asked whether we should not cooperate\r\n\r\nwith  the  telecommunications companies  to  develop  the  3G\r\n\r\ntechnology.   Sir, indeed, that is what we are going  to  do.\r\n\r\nIn  my  announcement on the decision to proceed with  the  3G\r\n\r\nauction last year, I had also mentioned that we are going  to\r\n\r\nset  aside a development fund for IDA to work with companies,\r\n\r\nthose  telecommunications companies who are the  3G  licensed\r\n\r\nholders,  as  well  as the service providers,  to  help  them\r\n\r\ndevelop  services, technology application that will give  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  a good headstart in this very new technology.   So\r\n\r\nwe  are  definitely  going along the line  that  Mr  Low  has\r\n\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, on broadband development,\r\n\r\nSingapore is the first country in the world to have installed\r\n\r\na  nationwide  interactive broadband  multimedia  network  in\r\n\r\n1997.   Since  then, I have wondered what  is  the  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs of this nationwide network.  Has it been put to  good\r\n\r\nand effective use?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that broadband network with big\r\n\r\ncapacity and fast speed is good.  But everything has a  cost,\r\n\r\nas  the Minister for Finance will tell you.  Has the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance's  allocation  for  the  broadband  project  been\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  implemented with an equitable  social  rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn?  Being such a big-scale project, naturally we do  not\r\n\r\nexpect immediate returns.  But is the Minister satisfied that\r\n\r\nwe  are  there?   How  many customers  are  there  using  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  One  network in business or  at  home?   Does  the\r\n\r\nnetwork suffer from a lack of content or usage?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost is one important factor in attracting usage as\r\n\r\nconsumers may be quite satisfied with accessing Internet at a\r\n\r\nslower  speed if broadband access costs are high compared  to\r\n\r\nnarrow  band Internet access.  Given the price elasticity  of\r\n\r\nsuch  demand,  especially at our population's  income  level,\r\n\r\nmany of the people may consider this a luxury.

We dream that these computers  will  help\r\n\r\nthem do their work, exchange ideas with colleagues around the\r\n\r\nworld,  and send off the work product to the boss  -  whether\r\n\r\nthis  product is a document, a book, a film or new  software,\r\n\r\nand  whether the boss is here in Singapore or on an  orbiting\r\n\r\nspace  station.

The\r\n\r\nInformation Superhighway must be a 20-lane road and not the 2-lane  road it is today.  Building the roads costs money,  and\r\n\r\nafter  that the users have to pay an arm and a leg (and maybe\r\n\r\nmore)  for the private investors to recoup their investments.\r\n\r\nWorse still, the roads lead to nowhere.  There is nothing  to\r\n\r\ndo  or  see, nothing to engage us and nowhere to go  when  we\r\n\r\nfinally  gain  access to the valuable Superhighway.   In  the\r\n\r\ngeek  world,  we  call  these  the  problems  of  \"cost\"  and\r\n\r\n\"content\".\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads have to be built for a country to be developed.\r\n\r\nThis  initial  infrastructure  is  usually  provided  for  by\r\n\r\ngovernments.  If private sector developers are employed,  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  use  is often subsidised - unless the  country  has\r\n\r\ndeveloped to a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npoint  where  this new road is but one of many other  cheaper\r\n\r\nalternatives.  The  costs of these roads  are  high,  but  no\r\n\r\ngovernment worth its salt passes the full cost to  the  user.\r\n\r\nWe built our physical roads in Singapore on that model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet when it comes to the critical age of the Internet,\r\n\r\nwe  have farmed out infrastructure development to the private\r\n\r\nsector,  to  the  highest bidder there is.   And  the  winner\r\n\r\ninvariably has to pass the final cost to the consumer, on top\r\n\r\nof his margin of profit (which will of course be high also if\r\n\r\nhe has few real competitors).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is commendable that the Government has broken\r\n\r\nSingTel's  monopoly on broadband infrastructure, and  we  are\r\n\r\nfortunate   that   the   technology   itself   has   improved\r\n\r\nsufficiently  for  there  to  be  more  than  one   non-telco\r\n\r\ncompetitor.  You see, Sir, duopolies and cartels  can  be  as\r\n\r\nharmful  as  monopolies.  And yet in our first  days  on  the\r\n\r\nSuperhighway, we had two monopolies in SingTel and  SCV.   It\r\n\r\nwas  one  or  the other: ADSL or cable.  Mutually  exclusive.\r\n\r\nAnd  until we have alternative copper wire networks owned not\r\n\r\nby  SingTel,  there  is  still a  chokehold  on  the  supply.\r\n\r\nWhether  it  is Pacific Internet or Superpromises Internet  - they  all have to buy space from SingTel, whose access  costs\r\n\r\ncan  kill  off  the  budding competitor,  or  whose  business\r\n\r\npractices  will  ensure  that the budding  competitor  cannot\r\n\r\nsurvive  one day beyond the deadline for paying up his  phone\r\n\r\nbill,  or whose control of the lines and the technology could\r\n\r\nensure  that subscribers of cable, for example, would not  be\r\n\r\nable to interface with certain services and content hosted on\r\n\r\nSingTel  servers.   Result: you have to  get  both  ADSL  and\r\n\r\ncable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for content, Sir, it would seem very much a private\r\n\r\nsector problem.  After all, when the roads are built,  it  is\r\n\r\nthe private sector which puts up the cinemas, shopping malls,\r\n\r\npetrol  stations, bowling alleys and whatnot.  While this  is\r\n\r\nlargely  true, I would like to remind Members that  what  the\r\n\r\nEDB  has  done  is to make Singapore a thriving manufacturing\r\n\r\ncentre  by  giving  grants,  tax  breaks  and  various  other\r\n\r\nincentives to bring investors to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  not  just building  industrial  estates  and\r\n\r\nscience parks.  We formed the EDB to help them also to smooth\r\n\r\nover  the rough passages so that they will not trip over  the\r\n\r\ncarpet in some bureaucrat's office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given itself a target of 400,000\r\n\r\nusers  of  broadband by end 2001.  The thinking of course  is\r\n\r\nthat  a  critical  mass  of this size is  important  so  that\r\n\r\nbroadband  providers would find a sufficiently  large  market\r\n\r\nbase   to  roll  out  pilot  projects.   Again,  this  is   a\r\n\r\ncommendable move.  But with broadband charges going  up,  how\r\n\r\nis the Government going to achieve that target?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take the liberty to suggest some\r\n\r\npossibilities for the Minister to consider?  (1)  We  should,\r\n\r\nif  we  cannot reduce charges, continue to give subsidies  to\r\n\r\npeople  who  sign  up  for  broadband  access.   The  current\r\n\r\nsubsidies  end on 1st April.  The scheme should be  extended,\r\n\r\nand better still, the subsidy rates increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Free broadband access should be given to all\r\n\r\nCommunity  Children's Libraries (CCLs), Residents  Committees\r\n\r\n(RCs),  community centres (CCs) and clubs in Singapore.   And\r\n\r\nwhen  the  access is easy and the presence of  the  broadband\r\n\r\nservices   ubiquitous,  people  will   grow   familiar   with\r\n\r\nbroadband.   Familiarity  drives out  fear  and  the  biggest\r\n\r\nbarrier to growth will be gone.  Soon everybody will be using\r\n\r\nbroadband as comfortably as they do with the ATM or  the  fax\r\n\r\nmachine  today.   The Government can pay the full  costs  of,\r\n\r\nsay,  two  accounts per RC or CCL and, perhaps,  up  to  five\r\n\r\naccounts per CC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) EDB-type incentive programmes and tax breaks should\r\n\r\nbe  given  to  content providers to provide  content  on  our\r\n\r\nbroadband network.  The IDA should go on a roadshow round the\r\n\r\nworld  to  attract talents and investors here to develop  the\r\n\r\ncontent industry.  Venture capital and seed funding should be\r\n\r\nfreely and liberally available to start-ups to enable them to\r\n\r\ntry  out  risky  innovations and experimental ventures.   Tax\r\n\r\ndeductions and exemptions\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould be available to those who risk their capital this way.\r\n\r\nNot  every cent we have should go willy-nilly into the still-nebulous one basket called \"life sciences\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Government should seriously consider pumping in\r\n\r\nmore  resources to develop the movie industry,  the  graphics\r\n\r\nand  animation industry, the music industry and the  software\r\n\r\nindustry.   We  should not only devote monetary resources  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  our  local giants but also liberalise  immigration\r\n\r\npolicies to attract talents to come to Singapore to  dig  for\r\n\r\ngold  in  these here streets of Singapore.  Our  schools  and\r\n\r\ninstitutes  of  higher learning should  initiate  courses  to\r\n\r\ntrain  such  of  our youths who are inclined  that  way.   We\r\n\r\nshould  put  the stars in their eyes and take  away  all  the\r\n\r\nbarriers  in  our  educational system (or in  their  parents'\r\n\r\nexpectations) so that they will venture out to work  in  such\r\n\r\nunconventional, untraditional jobs and industries.   Perhaps,\r\n\r\nMediaCorp  or  MediaWorks  can  give  out  scholarships   and\r\n\r\nguaranteed  jobs - the way our GLCs did when  they  developed\r\n\r\nour fledgling airline and shipping line so many years ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) There should be a tougher stance on anti-competitive\r\n\r\npractices.  The regulator is too congenial.  Hence, there  is\r\n\r\ninadequate  incentive  for  self-regulation.   Without   some\r\n\r\npainful  elbowing  in  the  sides of  the  industry  players,\r\n\r\nnothing  will move.  Perhaps, the winners of the 3G  licences\r\n\r\ncould be given a 30% discount if they can devote resources to\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  a  credible industry association,  or  watchdog\r\n\r\nbody, to assist the IDA in its regulatory activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, would it be possible to give tax breaks to\r\n\r\ncompanies which come up with innovative uses of broadband  in\r\n\r\ntheir  business?  It should not matter in this case  for  the\r\n\r\ntax  break whether they have devised new content or a new way\r\n\r\nto  provide  value-added services or simply to do  their  own\r\n\r\nwork and business better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need every hand at the helm as we steer our ship into\r\n\r\nthe  murky  waters  of  the broadband  future.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister agrees with me.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the successful development and\r\n\r\nimplementation of broadband network is a must if the  country\r\n\r\nis  to  compete  with  the rest of the  world.   A  broadband\r\n\r\nnetwork used by the greatest number of Singaporeans will  not\r\n\r\nonly  improve our lives, but necessary for business  and  the\r\n\r\nrunning  of  e-Government.  I can safely say that  this  will\r\n\r\ndetermine  and  sharpen our long-term  competitiveness  as  a\r\n\r\nnation.   In  the  business environment of tomorrow,  a  good\r\n\r\ncommunication system is no more than just a telephone  system\r\n\r\nthat  works.  It is the ability to transmit and receive  high\r\n\r\nvolume  of  digital information that defines the  competitive\r\n\r\nedge  of  nations.   Therefore, when other countries  in  the\r\n\r\ndeveloping   world  are  floundering,  we  must  take   every\r\n\r\nopportunity to move ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, not all countries are floundering though.\r\n\r\nSouth  Korea,  not a country strong in the English  Language,\r\n\r\nhas  taken to broadband and the Internet like fish to  water,\r\n\r\ndespite  not quite coming out of the Asian financial  crisis.\r\n\r\nToday,  there  are  no less than 3.4 million  subscribers  of\r\n\r\nbroadband  service.  When I visited Seoul  in  November  last\r\n\r\nyear  for  a trade show, scores of Korean companies  were  on\r\n\r\ndisplay  developing software for Internet.   Look  right  and\r\n\r\nleft  and one cannot help but see the URLs instead of company\r\n\r\nnames  on most commercial buildings.  We do not see  that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, in Singapore, we have no more than 300,000\r\n\r\nsubscribers.  We read of slow service complaints in the Forum\r\n\r\npages of our dailies.  I understand that the speed of the SCV\r\n\r\nservice drops to as low as 26 kbps.  A dial-up modem now  can\r\n\r\nget  you something like 56 kbps.  Is it due to the fact  that\r\n\r\nSCV  is  buying insufficient bandwidth from SingTel, a  point\r\n\r\nwhich was made earlier by Prof. Toh See Kiat?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides slow service, there are also complaints\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  expensive.  Effective from next month,  we  all\r\n\r\nknow,  it is going to be even more expensive when the subsidy\r\n\r\nfrom the IDA is removed.  This will be a bigger impediment to\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngrowth  of broadband.  Is the Government not concerned  about\r\n\r\nthis?   Is  it not the Government's duty to fund its  further\r\n\r\ndevelopment?   If  broadband is so crucial to  our  long-term\r\n\r\nwell-being,  the question that comes to mind is  whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   doing   enough.   Maybe   not.    Broadband\r\n\r\ninfrastructure is akin to the building of roads  and  rolling\r\n\r\nstock of our MRT.  One can imagine where we will be today  if\r\n\r\nwe charge the full cost of the roads and rolling stock to the\r\n\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since 3G is also a piece of the broadband jigsaw,\r\n\r\nwe  have to develop this with the concept of road building in\r\n\r\nmind.   Instead, we can readily see where the  Government  is\r\n\r\nheading.  The Government is trying to squeeze as much out  of\r\n\r\nthe  consumers  on the front end by setting  a  high  reserve\r\n\r\nprice for the coming auction, despite what the Minister  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  price  has now dropped to $100  million.   He  has\r\n\r\nargued  that, just only a month ago, it was going to be  $150\r\n\r\nmillion.   In other words, this technology moves so fast  and\r\n\r\nprices  have moved just as fast.  But having said that,  Sir,\r\n\r\neven  if  we  reduced  the  reserve price  to  $100  million,\r\n\r\nindustry sources say the minimum bid price, if based on  $100\r\n\r\nmillion, works out to some US$60 for each Singaporean.   This\r\n\r\ncompares to Switzerland, where the bids tumbled to US$17  per\r\n\r\ncitizen,  a point which I raised at Question Time  few  weeks\r\n\r\nago.   The  Minister  was arguing why  that  is  economically\r\n\r\ncorrect.  I think by the time the tender comes out and  maybe\r\n\r\ngive another month, hopefully, we will see something like $50\r\n\r\nmillion  if  we agree to adopt the road building  model.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, we have to create the broadband, both  wireless\r\n\r\nand  non-wireless.  And if the development  of  broadband  is\r\n\r\nreally  necessary  for the long-term viability  and  success,\r\n\r\nthen I think we have to adopt a different business model.  In\r\n\r\nthis case, the road building model is really best suited  for\r\n\r\nour needs because the country does not really need the money.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is a system in place and worry about getting the\r\n\r\nmoney later on, not getting the money upfront.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Sir, I thank the Members for\r\n\r\ntheir  interest and comments on the broadband development  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Basically, Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Prof. Toh See  Kiat\r\n\r\nand  Mr Chng Hee Kok asked about where are we today, in terms\r\n\r\nof  take-up rate, content, application development,  cost  of\r\n\r\naccess,  subsidy, quality of service, and so on.  They  would\r\n\r\nalso  like  to know what are we doing to sustain  the  future\r\n\r\ndevelopment of broadband in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may respond broadly from two aspects.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  where are we today, and secondly, where  do  we  go\r\n\r\nfrom  here.   Firstly, where are we today?   Are  we  in  the\r\n\r\nnightmare scenario, as painted by Prof. Toh See Kiat?  Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo  not think so.  As pointed out by Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Mr\r\n\r\nChng  Hee Kok, we are among the first countries in the  world\r\n\r\nto embark on broadband development way back in 1997/1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, our efforts in promoting the use of broadband are\r\n\r\nbearing  fruits.  For example, the number of broadband  users\r\n\r\nin  Singapore has more than doubled from 100,000 in  December\r\n\r\n1999  to  over 270,000 by the end of last year.  Mr Chng  Hee\r\n\r\nKok  mentioned the fast growth in South Korea.  He is  right.\r\n\r\nSouth Korea is making tremendous progress in the adoption  of\r\n\r\nbroadband.   But  if you look at Singapore's  statistics,  we\r\n\r\nhave  not  performed  any  worse either.   In  fact,  270,000\r\n\r\nbroadband users work out to about one in six Internet  users,\r\n\r\nmeaning  that  out of six Internet users in Singapore  today,\r\n\r\none  is a broadband Internet adopter.  This penetration  rate\r\n\r\nplaces Singapore among one of the highest in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh See Kiat commented that S-One today is a road\r\n\r\nto  nowhere.  Sir, I am happy to report that this  is  indeed\r\n\r\nnot  the  case.  Initially, the main attraction of  broadband\r\n\r\nInternet was to provide a fast access to narrowband Internet.\r\n\r\nThis  was  how broadband Internet was positioned in 1999  and\r\n\r\n2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, today, the situation has changed tremendously.\r\n\r\nTake,  for example, the case of Singapore.  We now have  more\r\n\r\nthan  300  applications developed in Singapore  on  broadband\r\n\r\nInternet.  This is an increase of 50% from a year ago.  If we\r\n\r\nwere   to  go  to  Singapore  ONE  today,  we  can  see  very\r\n\r\ninteresting  applications  and  contents  relating  to,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  online  newspapers.  And these  are  not  just  the\r\n\r\nnarrowband  newspapers.  These are multimedia,  rich  content\r\n\r\nand rich media newspapers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at e-learning applications, again, these are\r\n\r\nbroadband-based multimedia.  For lifestyle entertainment,  we\r\n\r\ncan  look  at e-magazines.  Again, they come in all kinds  of\r\n\r\ncontent - video, music and so on.  Cyber shopping, it can now\r\n\r\nbe  conducted in 3D; video and KTV - Chinese, English,  Malay\r\n\r\nand  so  on - they are now available.  Lately, companies  are\r\n\r\nusing  S-One  to  do  product marketing through  the  use  of\r\n\r\nstreaming  video.  On the whole, I would say  that  S-One  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  a  road to nowhere.  Can it  be  better?   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, it can be better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the comments that subscription to S-One broadband\r\n\r\ncosts  an  arm  and a leg, I do not think this is  the  case.\r\n\r\nSir,  in  the last one year alone, we have seen the  cost  of\r\n\r\nbroadband   access   coming  down  very   rapidly.    As   an\r\n\r\nillustration, the cost of unlimited broadband access on cable\r\n\r\nTV,  through  SCV, has now fallen to $66 for  those  who  are\r\n\r\ncable  TV  subscribers,  and  $76  for  those  who  are  non-subscribers.  If we go to SingNet, for example,  we  can  now\r\n\r\nget 25 hours of broadband access for about $45 - cheaper than\r\n\r\nHong Kong and comparable to the price in Taiwan.  So, on  the\r\n\r\nwhole, the cost of broadband access in Singapore is as  cost-competitive as any other country we can find.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I note that some Members are concerned that\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  broadband access may go up on 1st April  2001,\r\n\r\nwith the reduction in Government subsidies.  Sir, let me just\r\n\r\ntake  a  few minutes to explain why the subsidy was there  in\r\n\r\nthe  first instance.  In 1998/1999, when we wanted to promote\r\n\r\nthe use of Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nONE  and  broadband in Singapore, the take-up rate  was  slow\r\n\r\nbecause,  exactly as Prof. Toh See Kiat mentioned, it  was  a\r\n\r\nroad  to nowhere.  There was no content, no application.   So\r\n\r\nthere  was  no  reason for subscribers  to  go  on  broadband\r\n\r\nInternet.  But, if we are not able to grow the user base, the\r\n\r\napplication  and service providers are not going  to  develop\r\n\r\ntheir applications.  In order to break this cycle, we decided\r\n\r\nto jumpstart the user base in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, therefore, decided to subsidise,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  the cost of the modem.  We subsidised  70%  of  the\r\n\r\ncost  of broadband modem to the users.  Secondly, we provided\r\n\r\nsubsidies on the cost of International Leased Circuits  (ILC)\r\n\r\nbecause, in the case of Singapore, many users access contents\r\n\r\nthat  are  hosted in the USA.  ILC is therefore  a  high-cost\r\n\r\nitem.   Before we liberalised the telecommunications  market,\r\n\r\nILC  cost  in Singapore indeed was higher, compared  to  Hong\r\n\r\nKong  and other countries.  So we decided to break the  chain\r\n\r\nby  subsidising cable and ADSL modems, as well as the cost of\r\n\r\nILC.   Because of the subsidies, we were able to  expand  the\r\n\r\nbase  of the broadband users to where we are today - 270,000.\r\n\r\nHaving achieved this 270,000 base, our assessment is that  we\r\n\r\nhave  done  enough  in terms of creating a critical  mass  of\r\n\r\nusers and, therefore, we decided that it is now time for  the\r\n\r\nmarket  forces  to take full effect.  That is why,  effective\r\n\r\nfrom  December last year, we removed the subsidy on broadband\r\n\r\nmodem  and,  on  1st October this year, we  will  remove  the\r\n\r\nsubsidies for ILC so that competition can take over.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this mean that the cost of broadband Internet will\r\n\r\nnow  increase  to  beyond  the affordability  of  the  users?\r\n\r\nAgain,  Sir,  we  do not think so.  Firstly,  for  the  early\r\n\r\nadopters, we will continue to subsidise the cost of access to\r\n\r\nbroadband Internet.  For example, we are now working with the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education on a programme called FastTrack@School,\r\n\r\nwhere  we  are  experimenting  with  broadband  Internet  and\r\n\r\nmultimedia content in the schools.  Sir, about 27 schools are\r\n\r\nnow on this programme.  And we will continue\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto provide subsidies and incentives to these users under this\r\n\r\nprogramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the mass market on the whole, we expect the charges\r\n\r\nfor  broadband Internet in time to come to become  even  more\r\n\r\nattractive  and, at the same time, the quality of service  to\r\n\r\nimprove for at least two reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the liberalisation of the telecommunications\r\n\r\nmarket  has  led  to, and will continue to lead  to,  further\r\n\r\nreductions in the cost of International Leased Circuit.  This\r\n\r\nmeans  that with the lower cost of ILC, the cost of broadband\r\n\r\naccess should come down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have put in place an open access framework\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  the broadband infrastructure  will  not  be\r\n\r\nmonopolised  by  any  particular  broadband  access   service\r\n\r\nprovider.   For  example, since October last  year,  we  have\r\n\r\nenforced  open  access on ADSL, the telephone line  owned  by\r\n\r\nSingTel.   So  there  are now four broadband  access  service\r\n\r\nproviders  providing ADSL services, and they  are:   SingNet,\r\n\r\nPacific  Century Cyberworks and Pacific Internet, in addition\r\n\r\nto  SingTel  Magix.  In time to come, we believe  that,  with\r\n\r\nopen  access,  there  will be more broadband  access  service\r\n\r\nproviders  in  the  marketplace.  Through this  more  intense\r\n\r\ncompetition  among them, cost will come down and the  quality\r\n\r\nof  service  will go up.  We think this is a more sustainable\r\n\r\nway of growing the broadband market in Singapore, instead  of\r\n\r\nrelying on Government subsidies all the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking ahead, where do we go from here? I share\r\n\r\nthe point by Prof. Toh See Kiat that we do have a dream.  Our\r\n\r\ndream is very much like the dream that he has described,  but\r\n\r\nmaybe  with  one difference. That is, it will not necessarily\r\n\r\nbe  centred around computers alone.  We believe that  in  the\r\n\r\nworld of the future, computers would be one device, but there\r\n\r\nwill  be  many  other broadband appliances.   In  fact,  with\r\n\r\nbroadband Internet, 3G, and Internet appliances, the day will\r\n\r\ncome  when  Singaporeans  will be  able  to  have  access  to\r\n\r\nbroadband Internet, multimedia\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontent  any  time, any place, using almost  any  device,  to\r\n\r\naccess almost any form of media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, we fully agree with Mr Chay Wai Chuen\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Chng Hee Kok that broadband development will have  a\r\n\r\npositive   impact   on   the  long-term  competitiveness   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This is why we do look at the future development\r\n\r\nof broadband Internet with a lot of priority and emphasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to highlight three areas where we will\r\n\r\ncontinue to intervene, facilitate and develop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first area of priority is in content development.\r\n\r\nWe  intend  to  continue  to  speed  up  the  development  of\r\n\r\ninnovative contents and pioneering broadband applications  in\r\n\r\nareas such as e-Learning, edutainment and e-Home.  Under  the\r\n\r\nincentives  programme that we provide, we have, for  example,\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for new media and contents enrichment.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   incentivise  the  industry   and   the   user\r\n\r\norganisations to move in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of priority is in content hosting and\r\n\r\napplication  development.  We will continue to  attract  more\r\n\r\nregional  as well as the global players to come to  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  host their broadband contents out of Singapore, not  just\r\n\r\nfor  the Singapore market, but also for the regional and  the\r\n\r\nAsia  Pacific market.  In fact, we have already  in  place  a\r\n\r\nprogramme known as the International Contents Hosting  Scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby  we  provide  very strong incentives  for  all  these\r\n\r\nbroadband   contents  owners  to  bring  their  contents   to\r\n\r\nSingapore for the Asia-Pacific markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third priority is in the area of content delivery.\r\n\r\nWe  are  going  to continue to facilitate and  encourage  the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications  operators and building  owners  to  bring\r\n\r\nbroadband  infrastructure  to  more  buildings,  hotels   and\r\n\r\ncommercial  buildings,  so  that,  in  time  to   come,   all\r\n\r\nbusinesses would have easy access to broadband contents  from\r\n\r\ntheir workplaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we are committed to continue to\r\n\r\nbuild  on  our  broadband foundation which we have  developed\r\n\r\nover  the  last  three  to four years and  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nembrace new broadband technology, such as the 3G and  so  on.\r\n\r\nAt  the  end of the day, it is our objective and priority  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that  Singapore will remain a leading  nation  in\r\n\r\nbroadband  development as we pursue the  vision  of  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy and an information society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, on the programmes to bridge the\r\n\r\ndigital  divide, the Government has committed to spend  about\r\n\r\n$25  million  over three years to help our community  outside\r\n\r\nthe  schools  to  bridge this so-called digital  divide,  and\r\n\r\nvarious  languages,  as  media, are also  used  in  order  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate this access to the world of Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2-roomers and 3-roomers in the HDB estates should be\r\n\r\ngiven access to this use of Internet readily.  Access to  the\r\n\r\nworld  of Internet may mean many things.  Definitely, we  can\r\n\r\nstart by having a PC and get connected.  Poorer families  may\r\n\r\nhave  no  such  access in having a PC,  and  paying  for  the\r\n\r\nsubscription can be quite costly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access can also mean proximity to community centres or\r\n\r\nsuch  programmes as currently run by IDA or  funded  by  IDA,\r\n\r\nCDCs,  CCMCs and so on.  Will the Minister consider extending\r\n\r\nthis  project  to  Residents' Committees  and  PAP  Community\r\n\r\nFoundation Centres, with co-funding of such projects?  I feel\r\n\r\nthat  extending to the RCs and the PCF centres is a good  way\r\n\r\nof reaching out at the grassroots level and provides a useful\r\n\r\nmedium for grassroots to keep close to the people.  Also, RCs\r\n\r\nand  PAP Community Foundation Centres, being in the heart  of\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  estates,  are nearer and give  convenience  to  the\r\n\r\nchildren in the nearby flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, the Infocomm\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Authority  or IDA calls  it  work  in  progress:\r\n\r\nsociety being hooked up.  Infocomm technology has powered  up\r\n\r\nall  aspects of life in Singapore, from playing to  learning,\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npaying bills.  By the same token, technology has also invaded\r\n\r\nall  aspects  of  our  lives, regardless  of  our  degree  of\r\n\r\npreparedness  or  understanding.   The  ability   to   employ\r\n\r\ntechnology or, better still, to master the use, is of  course\r\n\r\ndesirable,  but the inability to use or being intimidated  by\r\n\r\nthe  very pervasiveness of technology can be daunting.   This\r\n\r\nis the reality today for Singaporeans, where the pace of life\r\n\r\nhas been blistering and, the ability to embrace, achieved  to\r\n\r\nvarying degrees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as what the Minister has opined, whether we\r\n\r\nsucceed or not will depend on the active, committed and civic-minded  Singaporeans who make a difference.  As we are aware,\r\n\r\nthe  Government has dedicated $25 million over the next three\r\n\r\nyears  to  \"dot.com\" Singaporeans.  But  the  bulk  of  these\r\n\r\nefforts,  like the current e-Celebrations event, would  still\r\n\r\nrely  on  an  awareness  and a willingness  on  the  part  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to participate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I cannot fault the IDA in terms of\r\n\r\nprogrammes to reach out to the various people across  a  wide\r\n\r\nspectrum.  In fact, I would like to urge the IDA to  continue\r\n\r\nto  actively  engage  in  efforts  with  the  grassroots  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  organisations.  However, I believe the  Government\r\n\r\nitself  should  go  beyond the mere provision  of  funds  and\r\n\r\nschemes  by  extending more widely, through public  education\r\n\r\nthrough the media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recall when Hong Kong was trying to promote the\r\n\r\nuse  of  electronic point-of-sale transactions  back  in  the\r\n\r\n1980s,  they  ran  carefully-scripted  TV  campaigns,  subtly\r\n\r\naddressing  potential concerns and complete with a  Cantonese\r\n\r\njingle  that  even the most conservative of housewives  would\r\n\r\nhum.   I  would  like to urge the Minister to consider  doing\r\n\r\nsomething similar for new developments which will change  the\r\n\r\nway  we live and work, for example, what 3G is all about,  or\r\n\r\nwhat  broadband access means.  And this should not be  merely\r\n\r\ndiscussed  over  a  programme  over  ChannelNews  Asia,   but\r\n\r\nextensively  carried over TCS 5, 8 and Suria, and  the  local\r\n\r\npapers.  Some degree of understanding will, I believe,  go  a\r\n\r\nlong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nway towards helping those who are less tech-savvy not feel so\r\n\r\nalienated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, to enable Singaporeans to rise\r\n\r\nup  to  the  challenges  in the new  economy,  they  must  be\r\n\r\ncomputer literate and Internet savvy.  However, there is this\r\n\r\ndigital  divide  between the high and low-income  households,\r\n\r\nand  the  well-educated versus those who are  not.   Our  HDB\r\n\r\nheartlanders, older workers and housewives are the  group  of\r\n\r\npeople  who may not have access to computers and,  thus,  lag\r\n\r\nbehind in embracing an e-lifestyle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC realises this importance and has pledged to\r\n\r\ntrain  10,000 union leaders in basic IT and Internet  skills.\r\n\r\nTo   date,  a  few  thousand  workers  have  completed  their\r\n\r\ntraining.  NTUC has even tied up with PeoplePC to adminster a\r\n\r\nprogramme to give union members access to computers with  all\r\n\r\nthe support network for less than $1 a day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, union members comprise less than 30% of the\r\n\r\ntotal  workforce in Singapore.  I would like to inquire about\r\n\r\nthe  plan of the Government to bridge this digital divide for\r\n\r\nour  HDB  heartlanders, particularly the  older  workers  and\r\n\r\nhousewives.  Is the Government planning to have concrete  and\r\n\r\nstructured IT public education programmes to benefit our  HDB\r\n\r\nheartlanders,  older  workers  and  housewives?   This  would\r\n\r\ndefinitely   speed   up  the  process  of  the   Government's\r\n\r\ninitiative to bring infocomm to all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged by the efforts made by some of the\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations, VWOs and churches to contribute, in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  individual ways, to educate  the  public  on  IT.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there is a limitation to their outreach.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  suggest the Government develop a national programme\r\n\r\non IT public education, riding on the CDC, PA or PCF network,\r\n\r\nso  that  all Singaporeans can have an opportunity to embrace\r\n\r\nthe e-lifestyle.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I must first compliment the\r\n\r\nMinistry and, in particular,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIDA for their efforts in promoting IT and e-lifestyle amongst\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The e-Celebrations, which were just inaugurated in March\r\n\r\nlast year and now held for a second time this year, have  and\r\n\r\nwill,  I  believe,  create  a greater  awareness  of  IT  and\r\n\r\nadoption of e-lifestyle amongst Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support campaigns such as e-Celebrations in\r\n\r\npromoting  IT  through events and mass media.  However,  such\r\n\r\nevents  as e-Celebrations here and e-Exhibition there,  while\r\n\r\ncreating  general  awareness, may not by  themselves  produce\r\n\r\nsubstantial  permanent  change in  the  people's  ability  to\r\n\r\nmaster  or  sit  in  front of the computer.   After  creating\r\n\r\nawareness,  what we need is a more sustained  effort  at  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots level to reach out to the housewives, retirees and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are not so well-educated.  I suspect  that  these\r\n\r\ngroups  of people may not be reached by the mass events  such\r\n\r\nas  e-Celebrations.  They are probably even afraid to  go  to\r\n\r\nsuch  an  exhibition.  There is an inherent fear among  these\r\n\r\npeople  to anything that is high-tech, more so, if the events\r\n\r\nare  held  in town centres, and launched in Suntec City,  and\r\n\r\nnot in an HDB heartland or HDB neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on Monday, I highlighted in this House our\r\n\r\nexperience  in setting up the Marine Parade CDC  Fengshan  IT\r\n\r\ncentres.   Sir, if you will recall, you are one  very  strong\r\n\r\nsupporter of the particular setting up of these IT centres as\r\n\r\nMayor  of Marine Parade CDC and for that, we all can  jointly\r\n\r\ncelebrate what we have done.  The success we have in reaching\r\n\r\nout to some 25,000 persons going through a training programme\r\n\r\nin  the  last  three years and equipping them with  basic  IT\r\n\r\nskills, in my view, is grassroots action at work and is  most\r\n\r\nencouraging.   I  have also related some  real  life  success\r\n\r\nstories   of  housewives  and  retirees  to  show  that   the\r\n\r\ngrassroots approach is perhaps the best way to reach  out  to\r\n\r\nthis  group  of  people.  When we talk about digital  divide,\r\n\r\nthose  on the wrong side of the divide can be brought  up  to\r\n\r\nthe main stream and this can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we must bring IT education to the HDB\r\n\r\nheartlanders.    We  have  very  successful  IT   programmes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, if the Minister would like to see our report on what\r\n\r\nwe  have  done, I would be more than pleased to  furnish  him\r\n\r\nwith the report on what has been done in Fengshan.  It is  my\r\n\r\npleasure to give him such a report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore calling on the Government to consider\r\n\r\nmore  funding for grassroots organisations such as the  CDCs,\r\n\r\nthe  CCCs and RCs to promote IT to our residents.  The  funds\r\n\r\ncan be used to set up centres in the neighbourhood to provide\r\n\r\nIT  literacy  courses.  We will bring IT to their  doorsteps.\r\n\r\nThe  funds  can  also be used to promote computer  ownership.\r\n\r\nFor instance, at Fengshan, we have refurbished and given away\r\n\r\n200  old  computers.   Part of these funds  can  be  used  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  some of the old computers which would be given  away\r\n\r\nor  sell them at a much lower cost to residents and, in  this\r\n\r\nway, we can help low-income families to own computers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe such initiatives at the grassroots level will\r\n\r\ngo  a long way to help heartlanders to overcome their fear of\r\n\r\nIT  and  bring them on board.  This is one way which  we  can\r\n\r\nconquer the digital divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the four\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament who have spoken on the digital  divide\r\n\r\nand  the  importance for the Government to  act  strongly  to\r\n\r\nnarrow the digital divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MPs have all identified the key groups that\r\n\r\nneed  to be addressed, ie, low-income earners, older workers,\r\n\r\nhousewives and senior citizens, and that we need to bring the\r\n\r\ntraining programmes closer to them by bringing them into  the\r\n\r\nHDB heartland in order to make it convenient for them to gain\r\n\r\naccess to the training facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they have also pointed out that we should not just\r\n\r\ntake  single  approaches or use single  events  like  the  e-Celebrations as a means of reaching out to them.   I  totally\r\n\r\nagree with the remarks made by the four MPs.  What they  have\r\n\r\ntalked about reflects the complexities of the issue, and that\r\n\r\nis, this is a multi-faceted challenge\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  we  cannot  use  a \"one size fits  all\"  approach.   The\r\n\r\nchallenge is how to design programmes that can enable  us  to\r\n\r\nreach out to the four groups that we are talking about.   And\r\n\r\nhere,  I  think  the \"Many Helping Hands''  approach  is  the\r\n\r\ncorrect one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first give Members an idea of what is being done\r\n\r\nso  far and what do we see for the future.  One key programme\r\n\r\nfor  helping  the low-income families is something  which  Mr\r\n\r\nChng Hee Kok had also mentioned, and that is, giving free PCs\r\n\r\nto  low-income  families, PCs that are bundled together  with\r\n\r\nfree  Internet access as well as free training.  We have been\r\n\r\nworking  with the various self-help groups and the grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations like Mendaki, CDAC, SINDA and also with  a  few\r\n\r\nCDCs.   I  am  happy to inform Members that so far,  we  have\r\n\r\ngiven out a total of 2,000 PCs free to the families concerned\r\n\r\nand  we  would  be happy to work with Members  here,  through\r\n\r\ntheir  CDCs,  to  further  expand  this  programme  in  their\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  NTUC is also helping, as mentioned by Mr Yeo\r\n\r\nGuat  Kwang, to bridge the digital divide by making ownership\r\n\r\nof  PCs  affordable.   The  NTUC  EasyPC  Scheme  is  a  very\r\n\r\ncommendable one.  The union members can buy the PCs by paying\r\n\r\nonly  a  dollar a day and the response so far has been  quite\r\n\r\nencouraging.  I hope NTUC will continue to push this Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government side, the Ministry of Manpower and\r\n\r\nIDA,  together  with the NTUC, are also spearheading  certain\r\n\r\ntraining schemes and these schemes are all heavily subsidised\r\n\r\nby   the   Skills   Development  Fund,  Skills  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme, and by the NTUC Education and Training Fund.  As a\r\n\r\nresult, on the part of NTUC alone, they have managed to train\r\n\r\nover 70,000 workers over the last three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For homemakers and senior citizens, we have the One\r\n\r\nLearning  Place  in  the Toa Payoh Community  Library.   This\r\n\r\noffers infocommunications training courses which are tailored\r\n\r\nto   meet  the  individual  needs  and  capabilities  of  the\r\n\r\ntrainees.   I  think the homemakers and senior citizens  have\r\n\r\nfound that the training programmes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare   very  useful  because  they  can  take  those  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes in the language that they are comfortable with. To-date,  the  One  Learning  Place has already  trained  20,000\r\n\r\nhousewives and senior citizens. I am also happy to  say  that\r\n\r\nthe People's Association, on its part, also conducts basic IT\r\n\r\ntraining programmes for the elderly as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also have quite a few other programmes. I do\r\n\r\nnot know whether Members have heard of the IT coach.  The  IT\r\n\r\ncoach  goes  around to the CCs, schools and  shopping  malls.\r\n\r\nThe IT coach is a coach that is equipped with Internet access\r\n\r\nfacilities and PCs, and it visits the shopping malls  or  the\r\n\r\nCCs  and  the  participants are given a very  short  training\r\n\r\nprogramme that lasts between half an hour to one hour on  the\r\n\r\nuse of the PC and access to the Internet.  It is a very quick\r\n\r\nawareness  building  programme.  So far,  the  IT  coach  has\r\n\r\nalready serviced over 60,000 people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are part of what we call the \"Many Helping\r\n\r\nHands\" approach.  Where do we go forward from here?  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Members  that  we have to bring the programmes  to  the\r\n\r\nheartlanders and we are going to work very closely  with  the\r\n\r\nCDCs  to  identify centres that can be set  up  and  for  the\r\n\r\nfunding   support  to  be  given.   Because  some  of   these\r\n\r\nprogrammes  can be quite expensive, it will be difficult  for\r\n\r\nthe MPs on their own to drive the programmes.  So, by working\r\n\r\nwith the CDCs and the IDA, I think we can provide the support\r\n\r\nto bring those programmes down to the CCs and later on to the\r\n\r\nRC  level.   I will encourage those Members who are  keen  to\r\n\r\nencourage their CDCs to begin the dialogue with IDA.   I  can\r\n\r\nassure you that we will be giving you the full support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another programme that we are looking at, which is\r\n\r\nin  line  with  what Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has  mentioned,  is  a\r\n\r\nnational  IT training programme.  Here, we are talking  of  a\r\n\r\nnational  IT  literacy programme which  would  be  a  10-hour\r\n\r\nprogramme, very well-structured and drawn-up, and  we  expect\r\n\r\nthis programme to train 350,000 people over the next\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthree  years.  The key drivers of this programme will be  the\r\n\r\nNational  Library Board because the National  Library  has  a\r\n\r\nvery  good  network  of  community  libraries  and  will   be\r\n\r\nleveraging  on  their  facilities and their  locations.   The\r\n\r\nother members who will be driving this programme will be  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association, NTUC, the self-help groups like  CDAC,\r\n\r\nSINDA  and  Mendaki.  With all these multiple approaches,  we\r\n\r\nshould be able to further narrow the digital divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the dot-com frenzy\r\n\r\nhas  ended  abruptly and in the process dashed  many  hopeful\r\n\r\ndreams   but   regardless,  communication   and   information\r\n\r\ntechnologies  will relentlessly move on to change  our  lives\r\n\r\nand  our  organisations  and  institutions.   This,  we  must\r\n\r\nremember.   We  must therefore continue with our  efforts  to\r\n\r\nadopt  information  technology  to  transform  for  the   new\r\n\r\neconomy.  The dot-com saga must not distract us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have this nagging feeling that the national\r\n\r\nimpetus  towards  adoption  of  information  technology   has\r\n\r\nsomewhat  lost  steam.  Have we really lost the  drive?   For\r\n\r\nexample,  are we satisfied with the penetration of  usage  of\r\n\r\nbroadband?   My fellow parliamentary colleagues  have  spoken\r\n\r\nmuch  on  this issue and the Minister of State, Mr  Lim  Swee\r\n\r\nSay,  has replied as much.  But I believe that there is  much\r\n\r\nmore that we can do, and we must do.  I therefore want to add\r\n\r\nmy  voice to the appeal to the Government to seek even  lower\r\n\r\ncosts  of  broadband  access and  to  raise  the  quality  of\r\n\r\nservice.  I still feel that the broadband access charges  are\r\n\r\nhigh,  even  though the Minister of State has said  that  the\r\n\r\nprices are internationally competitive.  The cost of ADSL and\r\n\r\ncable  broadband  access remains outside  the  means  of  the\r\n\r\naverage household.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What progress have we made with e-commerce? The\r\n\r\nGovernment has used itself to spearhead this drive.  How many\r\n\r\nGovernment services are now available on-line?  How  much  of\r\n\r\nthe transactions have really gone on-line?  My gut feel is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat we have made some headway in the public sector, but  not\r\n\r\nmuch  in the private sector.  In the private sector, how many\r\n\r\ntransactions  are available on-line?  How much  has  actually\r\n\r\ngone  on-line?   I know that some supermarkets  have  website\r\n\r\nordering   capabilities.   How  many  other  companies   have\r\n\r\nemulated  them?   What else can the people  expect  from  our\r\n\r\ncompanies?  Do  we  have  a secure and user-friendly  on-line\r\n\r\npayment  system which users can trust and use?  More broadly,\r\n\r\nwhat  progress have we made in e-banking?  Again, personally,\r\n\r\nI  feel it is not much.  Do their own experience and those of\r\n\r\nforeign  banks  which have found the journey  into  e-banking\r\n\r\nrough  disillusioned  our banks?  I have  read  that  foreign\r\n\r\nbanks  have encountered great difficulties.  Some have scaled\r\n\r\ndown their on-line operations and others have even folded.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my fervent belief that, at least for us, the\r\n\r\nnew  economy is inevitable.  The questions asked earlier  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  easy  to  answer but thereupon the  outcome  of  our\r\n\r\nefforts to become an information society. Besides the need to\r\n\r\nbuild  an  information infrastructure, we  need  our  people,\r\n\r\norganisations and institutions to be information oriented.  I\r\n\r\nam  glad to hear the Minister explain the effort made to make\r\n\r\nour  people  computer  literate.  This  necessitates  mindset\r\n\r\nchange among all parties  -  people, workers and captains  of\r\n\r\nour  industries and institutions.  Much work needs to be done\r\n\r\nby the nation, by everyone, to move into the information age.\r\n\r\nI  urge that we do not relent on this task, and especially in\r\n\r\nthe  discouraged  atmosphere of the mauling  of  the  dot-com\r\n\r\ncompanies and of shattered dreams, that the Government  takes\r\n\r\nthe  lead  in maintaining the momentum of this drive  towards\r\n\r\nthe information society in the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, rumours\r\n\r\nthat  e-commerce is dying or has died are, as usual,  greatly\r\n\r\nexaggerated.   I  think e-commerce is  going  through  a  bad\r\n\r\npatch,  and several dot-com companies have disappeared.   But\r\n\r\nSingapore is positioning\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nitself as an e-commerce hub, and many of us who have used  e-commerce,  including e-banking, have found it to be  somewhat\r\n\r\nakin  to an addiction.  Like opium, you take a bit, you  want\r\n\r\nto  have more.  But, like opium, you always have this nagging\r\n\r\nfeeling that you are doing something not quite right.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is this sense of insecurity coming from? I think\r\n\r\nit  comes  from  the fact that there is a genuine  fear  that\r\n\r\nwhatever you disclose to a dot-com company for your purchases\r\n\r\nand  so  on,  whatever personal information may  one  day  be\r\n\r\ncompromised.   And  this fear is actually a  very  real  one.\r\n\r\nAnyone  who has used e-banking or e-commerce will  always  be\r\n\r\nlooking  at  his credit card numbers and saying, \"Where  will\r\n\r\nthis reappear next time?\", whether it be in Japan or in other\r\n\r\nparts  of  the world.  So, one of the reasons that is  fairly\r\n\r\nwell  documented  why  consumers  are  diffident  towards  e-commerce is their fear that their personal information may be\r\n\r\ndisclosed, and that if we want e-commerce to move  ahead,  we\r\n\r\nwill  need  to  come  out  with a clear  policy  on  consumer\r\n\r\nsecurity and privacy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this issue should be tackled sooner rather than\r\n\r\nlater.  There is a view that we should allow the industry  to\r\n\r\nregulate itself, but it is likely to be a recipe for  inertia\r\n\r\nor  long-term  wrangling  as to what  the  proper  procedures\r\n\r\nshould be.  In the US, they have virtually given up on  that,\r\n\r\nand  there are currently eight Internet privacy Bills  to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered by the new Congress.  And I would like now to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  take action to determine the  policies  of\r\n\r\nconsumer  privacy  as a means of encouraging  the  growth  of\r\n\r\nInternet commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me just provide a familiar example of the need\r\n\r\nfor  privacy.  Many Singaporeans here, including  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House,  must have used Amazon.com to order  books,  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  other  products.  In the  early  days,  Amazon.com\r\n\r\nwould  just  take  your order and send you the  articles  you\r\n\r\nordered, and that would be the end of the transaction.   But,\r\n\r\ngradually, the company developed ways and means to allow you,\r\n\r\nfirst, to keep\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrack of your order.  At the same time, it kept track of what\r\n\r\nyou  ordered.  So, the next time you log on, they  will  say,\r\n\r\n\"Hello,  welcome  again.   Here are our  recommendations  for\r\n\r\nyou.\"  And there will be a new list of books which they  have\r\n\r\ntracked, which they will then suggest that you look at.  Now,\r\n\r\nthey have gone one step further.  They kept track of everyone\r\n\r\nas  a  group,  so that they can recommend to you books  which\r\n\r\nothers of similar taste have ordered, so that you too can  be\r\n\r\nadvised  as  to what else you can order.  In this  way,  they\r\n\r\nhave, of course, increased their commercial appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this type of matching of personal data and so on\r\n\r\nsuggests  privacy risks, and it also suggests that  companies\r\n\r\nof this type will build up huge databases which one day could\r\n\r\nbe  sold for profit.  Of course, I thought that since  I  was\r\n\r\nordering  from  Amazon.com,  I  have  no  worries   of   this\r\n\r\nhappening.   Until  recently, I  heard  from  a  report  that\r\n\r\nAmazon.com was about to be acquired and that if it were to be\r\n\r\nacquired,  it was going to sell its customer database.   Now,\r\n\r\nthey  come  in for some very severe criticism, and they  have\r\n\r\ndecided  not  to  do that.  But this actually  suggests  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  very serious problem and that  if  we  want  e-commerce  to grow, we must also have the legal infrastructure\r\n\r\nin  place to make sure that individuals, consumers who use e-commerce, should have the confidence to do so.  And  this  is\r\n\r\nparticularly so in the case of e-banking.  But it is also the\r\n\r\ncase  where  you  buy health products, for  example,  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet. If  you  make  an order for  viagra  through  the\r\n\r\nInternet, you  might be worried what people might  think  if\r\n\r\nthis information were to get into the public domain, and  you\r\n\r\nwould  like to see some privacy provisions in place for  this\r\n\r\nsort of thing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I would like to propose, as an initial step,\r\n\r\nis  that  all  companies  which are  involved  in  e-commerce\r\n\r\ntransactions should be required to state clearly  and  simply\r\n\r\ntheir  privacy policy, ie, what they will do with the private\r\n\r\ninformation  that  they  collect  from  each  customer.   The\r\n\r\ncustomer can then opt in or out, depending on whether he sees\r\n\r\nthe company's policy is good or bad.  We\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  encourage companies, particularly those  thinking  of\r\n\r\ngoing  into e-commerce, to develop a best practices  approach\r\n\r\nto  Internet trading, one aspect of which is clearly  a  good\r\n\r\nprivacy policy.  But I certainly hope that the Ministry  will\r\n\r\nstudy  and quickly bring before this House a Bill to  give  a\r\n\r\nstatutory basis to privacy on the Internet.  I am sure that e-commerce will benefit as a result.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister recently\r\n\r\ntalked about the Asian IT Belt.  Could the Minister elaborate\r\n\r\non what the plans are to make this IT Belt a reality, and how\r\n\r\nSingapore will benefit from it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, with your indulgence, just now\r\n\r\nin  my  reply, I missed giving a reply to Mrs Lim Hwee  Hua's\r\n\r\nremarks.   I  want to thank her for her support and  for  her\r\n\r\nsuggestion that we should go beyond just all those events, in\r\n\r\nterms  of  creating awareness, but to also use the  media   - TV,  radio, newspapers.  Sir, I am happy to inform  her  that\r\n\r\nlast  year, in line with the inaugural e-celebrations  event,\r\n\r\nIDA  had  also utilised TV commercials to widen the level  of\r\n\r\nawareness amongst people.  Five TV commercials were used, and\r\n\r\nthey were telecast over Channels 5 and 8, and touched on  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  e-shopping,  e-banking,  e-communications,   e-learning and e-entertainment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post campaign survey showed that the level of\r\n\r\nawareness  of the commercials was very high, and  that  there\r\n\r\nwas  a  72%  penetration amongst our target  groups.   So,  I\r\n\r\ntotally  agree  with her that the use of the  media  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.  And for this year's e-celebrations, we are  doing\r\n\r\nthe  same  thing.   We are having a 5-week  6  TV  commercial\r\n\r\nprogramme, and this time it will be broadcast in the English,\r\n\r\nChinese,  Malay and Tamil channels.  This year, the  outreach\r\n\r\nwill  be  even  greater.  And we will definitely  review  the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of this programme and, if need be, we will  have  it\r\n\r\nmore often.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b> Sir, Dr Tan Boon Wan is concerned that\r\n\r\nwith  the  recent burst of the dot-com bubble,  our  national\r\n\r\nimpetus\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  IT  may  lose its steam.  Not too long ago,  people  left\r\n\r\ntheir jobs to rush into dot-com.  Today, I was told that \"dot-com\" is known as dot-gone, B-to-B means back to banking,  and\r\n\r\nB-to-C means back to consulting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I want to assure Dr Tan Boon Wan that as far as\r\n\r\nthe Government is concerned, we look at the evolution of dot-com  development as a structural change.  It is not something\r\n\r\nthat  will  come  and go away, because we  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nchange will continue for a long, long time to come.  Over the\r\n\r\nlast  20  years,  we have had this national impetus  to  keep\r\n\r\nSingapore up to date with IT, and we intend to continue to do\r\n\r\nso.   In  fact, under Infocomm 21, we are pursuing the vision\r\n\r\nof  an  e-economy, e-society as well as e-Government.  We  do\r\n\r\nintend   to  reinvent  the  economy,  the  society  and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment and public sector, so that the 3P sectors will  be\r\n\r\nable  to progress together and we can all live a better  life\r\n\r\nin the infocomm age of the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan asked how do we make sure that consumers\r\n\r\nwould  trust and use e-commerce.  This is also the same point\r\n\r\nraised  by  Prof.  Chin Tet Yung.  As far  as  e-commerce  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  again, we take it very seriously.   In  1998,  we\r\n\r\nannounced the e-commerce master plan.  Subsequent to that, we\r\n\r\nformed  a  multi-agency committee on e-commerce action  plan.\r\n\r\nThe  whole idea is to turn the master plan into real  action.\r\n\r\nI  am  happy  to  say that over the last 1-2 years,  all  the\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies were able to work together in a concerted\r\n\r\nmanner.  We also work very closely with the industry as  well\r\n\r\nas  the  people  sector under a 3P partnership  programme  to\r\n\r\npursue our vision in e-commerce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof. Chin mentioned, and also pointed out by Dr Tan\r\n\r\nBoon  Wan,  it  is  very important that we create  trust  and\r\n\r\nconfidence in the consumer in e-commerce.  Privacy is a  real\r\n\r\nconcern.    It   was  once  said  that  to  convey   personal\r\n\r\ninformation over the Internet, whether it is your credit card\r\n\r\nnumber  and so on, is like undressing in front of the  window\r\n\r\nwith  the  lights on.  You never know who is looking  at  you\r\n\r\nfrom the other side.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, what do we do? There are\r\n\r\nbasically  three  models  in  regulating  privacy.   The   US\r\n\r\nbelieved  in self-regulation.  Europe believed in  government\r\n\r\nlegislation.  And I think, over time, both have realised that\r\n\r\nthe two models will not work.  In the case of US, the pace of\r\n\r\nself-regulation is too slow.  In the case of  Europe,  to  go\r\n\r\nfor  government legislation is too inflexible.  In fact,  the\r\n\r\nworld  is  converging  towards  the  concept  known  as   co-regulation,  meaning  that  it  is  a  combination  of  self-regulation and government legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, I am pleased to share with this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  the  Ministry of Communications and  Information\r\n\r\nTechnology  has  decided  to  pursue  this  concept  of   co-regulation.   On the part of the business community,  just  a\r\n\r\nfew  days  ago,  my Minister announced the  formation  of  an\r\n\r\nindustry-led National Trust Council.  They are in the process\r\n\r\nof  formulating  a  privacy code for the  private  sector  to\r\n\r\nadopt.   And  I will convey to them Prof. Chin's suggestions,\r\n\r\neg, for all companies to state clearly their privacy policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of Government, we have taken steps to study\r\n\r\nfurther into this privacy issue.  My Minister has initiated a\r\n\r\ntask force within the Ministry.  This is an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninter-agency  task force chaired by our Permanent  Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe  task force will study the impact of the Internet and  e-commerce  on data protection and privacy.  It will take  into\r\n\r\naccount international developments in this area and will come\r\n\r\nout  with a recommendation regarding self-regulation  through\r\n\r\nthe  privacy code of the industry, as well as to examine  the\r\n\r\nneed for the introduction of a privacy legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
