Member\r\n\r\nthat the separation of the Federation and Singapore\r\n\r\nis artificial and that we are one economic unit and\r\n\r\nmust ultimately merge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore cannot reconcile this with his desire\r\n\r\nthat  we  ignore the request of the  Federation  in\r\n\r\nthis matter of temporarily assisting one of its new\r\n\r\nindustries.  He  questioned  whether  it  is   more\r\n\r\nimportant  to  us  to  keep  a  Federation  factory\r\n\r\nrunning than our trade with China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My statement yesterday morning expressed clearly\r\n\r\nwhy  a temporary ban on certain textiles from China\r\n\r\nonly  was  considered necessary in the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe   Malayan  economy  as  a  whole.  Whether  the\r\n\r\nparticular industry in the Federation in this  case\r\n\r\nmerits  this  protection  is  a  question  which  I\r\n\r\nsuggest the Federation Government is more competent\r\n\r\nto judge than the Member for Changi is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be deplored that the hon. Member seeks\r\n\r\nto  confuse  a purely domestic economic  action  by\r\n\r\ndragging   in   extraneous  issues  such   as   the\r\n\r\nFederation's proposed action against  the  Bank  of\r\n\r\nChina  or cold wars between the East and the  West,\r\n\r\nand  even  by  the absurd suggestion  that  we  are\r\n\r\ntrying to assist Japanese industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All actions on matters pertaining to our economy\r\n\r\nare taken solely with our own economic advantage in\r\n\r\nmind -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Not Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

The\r\n\r\nreason,  of  course,  is  because  the  embargo  on\r\n\r\nexports of rubber was lifted in 1956. However,  the\r\n\r\nhon. Member's conclusions drawn from figures quoted\r\n\r\nby  him  are rather confused. Percentages are  very\r\n\r\ngood  indeed for comparative purposes, but  in  the\r\n\r\nfinal analysis, it is the actual amount that counts\r\n\r\nfor evaluating trading balances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore quote the Singapore/China trade\r\n\r\nfigures:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n    1954    Imports    $68     million\r\n\r\n            Exports    $14        \"\r\n\r\n                      -----            \r\n\r\n            Deficit    $54     million\r\n\r\n                      -----            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    1957    Imports   $123.7   million\r\n\r\n            Exports   $ 45.7     \"\r\n\r\n                      ------            \r\n\r\n            Deficit   $ 78     million\r\n\r\n                      ------            \r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be clearly seen therefore that our\r\n\r\ntrading  deficit  with China has increased  by  $24\r\n\r\nmillion  as  compared between  1954  and  1957 - that\r\n\r\nthough our exports increased by $31.7 million,  our\r\n\r\nimports increased by $55.7 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are hard facts that cannot be denied and\r\n\r\nthe  hon.

The reply, Sir, I gave to\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member was dated 2nd December, before the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Changi  made  his  emotional   speech\r\n\r\nyesterday, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It will be recalled that when the Federation\r\n\r\nrequested our co-operation in this matter,  it  was\r\n\r\nfor   a   period  of  three  months   pending   the\r\n\r\nfinalisation  of the Federation's anti-dumping  law\r\n\r\nto  protect  its industries. It was on  this  basis\r\n\r\nthat   the  Singapore  Government  agreed  to   the\r\n\r\nFederation's request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government will therefore review\r\n\r\nthis suspension at the end of the year in the light\r\n\r\nof the circumstances then existing and the progress\r\n\r\nof the Federation's anti-dumping legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, import licences which have been issued\r\n\r\nup  to  the  date of the ban are confirmed  without\r\n\r\nhindrance on proof of commitment before the ban.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that this statement will help to\r\n\r\nclarify the issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.06 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I just want to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister for Commerce and Industry one question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards my speech yesterday, I admit that the\r\n\r\nfigures  are not in our favour, but what I want  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  is that the goods we import from  China\r\n\r\nare  mostly foodstuffs and Chinese medicinal herbs,\r\n\r\nand  if  we  are forced to import these  foodstuffs\r\n\r\nfrom  other  territories, can the  Minister  answer\r\n\r\nwhether that will be in our favour or not?  Can  we\r\n\r\nget much cheaper foodstuffs from sources other than\r\n\r\nChina?  Can  he  also assure us  that  we  can  get\r\n\r\nChinese  medicinal  herbs from  places  other  than\r\n\r\nChina?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the hon. Member has\r\n\r\nforgotten  one thing, and that is the reported  ban\r\n\r\non  exports from China to Singapore is not  of  our\r\n\r\nmaking. Secondly, we have no official intimation of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  ban. Thirdly, according to Press  reports,\r\n\r\nthese goods can be available if payment is made  in\r\n\r\ncash  in  Hongkong.  Fourthly,  according  to  this\r\n\r\nmorning's  Press reports which probably  will  come\r\n\r\nout in the afternoon papers, it is likely that this\r\n\r\nreported ban on exports from China - of which I  have\r\n\r\nhad  no official information - may be lifted shortly.\r\n\r\nHowever,  on the point he made about the effect  it\r\n\r\nmight  have  on us, I made that very  clear  in  my\r\n\r\nstatement yesterday, and that is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The suspension of export of certain preserves,\r\n\r\nsalted  vegetables  and fruits  could  create  some\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in supplies for those who prefer  these\r\n\r\narticles but it is unlikely to have any significant\r\n\r\neffect  on the cost of living as a whole. It  might\r\n\r\nperhaps  be  beneficial  by  switching  the   taste\r\n\r\npreference of consumers to similar locally produced\r\n\r\narticles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PIONEER INDUSTRIES (RELIEF FROM INCOME TAX) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of adjourned debate on\r\n\r\nQuestion - [3rd December]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.08 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Changi was interrupted\r\n\r\nyesterday.

Yesterday. I pointed out that  it\r\n\r\nwas  high  time  for us to consider  the  important\r\n\r\nquestion  of merger. If we believe that  merger  is\r\n\r\nthe  ultimate  goal  of both territories,  then  at\r\n\r\nleast  we should expect some sort of reaction  from\r\n\r\nthe other side; but up till now, Sir, our relations\r\n\r\nwith  the  opposite side of the Johore Straits  are\r\n\r\nvery, very cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our energetic Minister for Commerce and Industry\r\n\r\nonce  again wants to boost up industrialisation  in\r\n\r\nthis  country. Of course, in principle  as  I  said\r\n\r\nyesterday.  I wholly support the Bill but  we  must\r\n\r\nface reality. I do not think that tax holidays  for\r\n\r\nfive years or even ten years will be sufficient  to\r\n\r\nattract  any investor to invest his money  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry except wealthy political refugees. I do not\r\n\r\nthink that any genuine businessman or industrialist\r\n\r\nwill  have the determination to dump his  money  in\r\n\r\nthis  country to create new industries. So, I admit\r\n\r\nthat  I  am quite pessimistic with regard  to  this\r\n\r\nBill, unless this Government can assure us that the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government has something in the  nature\r\n\r\nof  a  long-term  Pan-Malayan economic  development\r\n\r\nplan  or  something like that; otherwise this  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  be a farce in the eyes of the public, because\r\n\r\nmany  industrialists in Singapore have had to  shut\r\n\r\ndown their businesses during the last few years  We\r\n\r\ncannot  merely  say that this was a result  of  the\r\n\r\nlabour unrest. What about the imposition of tariffs\r\n\r\nat  the Johore Causeway? If British-made goods  can\r\n\r\nenjoy  preferential tariff treatment, I cannot  see\r\n\r\nwhy   Singapore-made  goods  cannot  enjoy  similar\r\n\r\ntreatment. I am sure that the Minister for Commerce\r\n\r\nand  Industry has received numerous representations\r\n\r\non this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to conclude by saying that unless\r\n\r\nthis  Government can assure us that the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment has already agreed to have a Pan-Malayan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustrial  development plan, then he  should  stop\r\n\r\nfooling  himself and the people if he  thinks  that\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in Singapore can be a reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.

Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, since no other\r\n\r\nMember  wants  to  speak  on  this  Bill.  This  is\r\n\r\ncertainly, Sir, a contrast to the anxiety shown  by\r\n\r\neverybody  yesterday in wanting  to  speak  on  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University Bill, perhaps  because  of  the\r\n\r\nreason  put  forward  by  the  Member  for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar - for vote-catching purposes! An important Bill\r\n\r\nlike this, Sir, and so few speakers in this House!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tiong Bahru cited the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  requiring  50 per  cent  of  the  cost  in\r\n\r\nadvance  to lay electric cables and its  effect  on\r\n\r\nindustrial expansion. I admit, Sir, that this might\r\n\r\nhave  adverse effects on industrial expansion,  but\r\n\r\nbeyond the statutory powers that the Government has\r\n\r\nover  the City Council, the City Council is a fully\r\n\r\nelected body and it has as much right to carry  out\r\n\r\nits  own policies as the Government has. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  cannot counter the City  Council's\r\n\r\nactions. If there is a bad repercussion as a result\r\n\r\nof the City Council's actions, then it is up to the\r\n\r\npeople to recognise it and throw the lot out at the\r\n\r\nnext elections, if they wish to; but so long as the\r\n\r\nCity   Council  acts  as  an  elected   body,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot do anything about it. That is the\r\n\r\nproper   and   democratic   parliamentary   system.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is no use blaming the Minister or the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  what it has done or  pointing  out\r\n\r\nthat  the  City  Council is  taking  this  or  that\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi, Sir, has been emotional in\r\n\r\nthe last two days. First, he launches into a tirade\r\n\r\nagainst me about the trade with China. Then he goes\r\n\r\non  to talk about the Federation. In fact, what  he\r\n\r\nsays is that the Singapore Government must ram down\r\n\r\nthe  throat of the Federation Government  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat it has got to accept that Malaya and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  one economic unit.  Sir,  short  of\r\n\r\ngoing to war with the Federation, I do not see  how\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member or any Government in Singapore can\r\n\r\ndo  that. But what this Government is doing - this is\r\n\r\nwhat the hon. Member does not like, and he made  it\r\n\r\nvery  clear yesterday - is trying to co-operate  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.

The\r\n\r\nMember  wants us to go to war with the  Federation,\r\n\r\nand  we are not prepared to do that because we  are\r\n\r\nthinking  of  the future of Singapore,  and  not  a\r\n\r\nshort-term policy as thought of by the hon.

However, it is issues\r\n\r\nwhich  the  hon.

M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, beyond those two points,\r\n\r\nthere  are  no  real points made by any  Opposition\r\n\r\nMember. I was rather sorely touched by one  or  two\r\n\r\npoints made by the hon. Member for Changi yesterday\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was  talking about trade with  China.  He\r\n\r\nreferred  to industry and touched on the Minister's\r\n\r\nannouncement  of  protection policy.  What  has  he\r\n\r\ndone?  He  has been banging the table,  and  saying\r\n\r\nthat  we  have trade on the one hand and industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion on the other, and how do we reconcile the\r\n\r\ntwo?  And  he  said this morning that the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould not fool himself and fool the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, to give the diary of events\r\n\r\nafter my statement on 13th August to this House  on\r\n\r\nthe  protection policy. On 21st August, at a  Press\r\n\r\nconference, I announced the terms of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreference of the Protection Advisory Committee - that\r\n\r\nwas seven days after - and by the end of August I had\r\n\r\nannounced  the  names  of the  Protection  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee Members, and that is very fast indeed. On\r\n\r\n27th September we had the forms ready. Before that,\r\n\r\nSingapore   had   never  thought   of   protection.\r\n\r\nTherefore  everything had to  start  from  scratch.\r\n\r\nBelieve  me,  my officers, both past  and  present,\r\n\r\nhave  been working till very late at night  to  get\r\n\r\nthings  done. As I said, the forms were  ready  and\r\n\r\nthey were issued to those interested and who wished\r\n\r\nto apply for protection. Just before I left for the\r\n\r\nUnited   States   to   attend  the   Colombo   Plan\r\n\r\nConference,  we  had  received eight  applications.\r\n\r\nSome  of them we consider are rather frivolous,  as\r\n\r\nthey have not given sufficient data; but there  are\r\n\r\nthree that we consider merit consideration and they\r\n\r\nhave been given immediate consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  must realise that in  a  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem where there are Committees and so on, things\r\n\r\nhave  got to take their course. At times I do  feel\r\n\r\nfrustrated myself at the slowness of events, but if\r\n\r\nyou   are   not   going  to  have   a   dictatorial\r\n\r\nregime - where the Minister orders \"so  it  shall  be\r\n\r\ndone\" and it is done -  we have got to go through all\r\n\r\nthe   procedures,   even   though   they   may   be\r\n\r\nfrustrating; and therefore it takes time, -  things\r\n\r\nhave  got  to  be evaluated in their proper  light,\r\n\r\nSir.  Every  application has to be  judged  in  its\r\n\r\nproper light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other comment which was made and which\r\n\r\ntouched  me rather sorely was why I am bringing  up\r\n\r\nall  this  legislation at this late hour when  this\r\n\r\nGovernment's life is about to expire.  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  I feel that there is no time to  be  lost.\r\n\r\nEconomically,  Sir,  we are going  downhill  rather\r\n\r\nslowly  now,  but that slow movement  downhill  can\r\n\r\ndevelop  into  a much faster rolling  down  and  it\r\n\r\ncould  end in economic disaster for us. I am not  a\r\n\r\nscaremonger,  Sir, but I see the position  clearly.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, it is now generally acknowledged that our\r\n\r\nentrepot   trade   cannot   support   our   growing\r\n\r\npopulation. It was I, Sir, who in this  very  House\r\n\r\nin 1956 first stated this fact that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"there are people who cannot see the writing on the\r\n\r\nwall\" - that \"our entrepot trade cannot support  us\".\r\n\r\nAt  that  time, Sir, I was accused of  adopting  an\r\n\r\nalarmist attitude, but now I challenge anyone, Sir,\r\n\r\nto  say that I was wrong. Our trading deficits  are\r\n\r\ngetting bigger; unemployment is increasing, because\r\n\r\nthe trade level is falling off, and also because of\r\n\r\nthe increasing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our trade depends on the economic and political\r\n\r\npolicies  of  other countries and the experience  I\r\n\r\nhave  gathered  from  my going to  conferences  and\r\n\r\nmeeting  various political leaders  and  commercial\r\n\r\nleaders of other countries -  even though the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Telok Ayer might say it is all a waste of time\r\n\r\nfor  Ministers  to go to conferences,  even  though\r\n\r\nother   countries   do  send  Ministers   to   such\r\n\r\nconferences - it  does give me an  insight  into  the\r\n\r\nways  of  thinking of the countries with  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  got to trade. That is very important,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest to the next Minister for Commerce and\r\n\r\nIndustry,  whoever  he may  be,  that  it  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  for  him to go out and meet  leaders  of\r\n\r\nother  countries with whom we are  trading  and  to\r\n\r\nevaluate  their  economic position, their  policies\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  Sir, from my experiences gathered  at\r\n\r\nsuch  meetings  and mixing with  other  leaders,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  foresee a brighter future for our  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  than  it is now. Every country is  naturally\r\n\r\nout  to  do what is best for itself. It is a  cold,\r\n\r\nhard, competitive world and we must wake up to this\r\n\r\nfact and fight to survive. There is not a moment to\r\n\r\nlose  in  this fight. Sir, if you will only realise\r\n\r\nthe long hours we work behind the inscrutable walls\r\n\r\nof Fullerton Building, or even in Empress Place, to\r\n\r\nkeep this fight going; how the other Ministers give\r\n\r\nme  their full support by attending meetings at odd\r\n\r\nhours    and   perusing   lengthy   papers   during\r\n\r\nholidays - all to keep this fight going. And even the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General,  Sir,  has  been   overtaxed   in\r\n\r\npreparing  all  this complicated and  controversial\r\n\r\nlegislation - I must take my hat off to him, Sir. And\r\n\r\nwhy? Does anyone like to work late at night and  on\r\n\r\nholidays, when he can go to Changi beach and  swim?\r\n\r\nIt is because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  recognize the responsibility that  we  have  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  this fight. Sir, as long  as  I  am  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Commerce and Industry, I am determined\r\n\r\nthat  this fight shall go on. This legislation  may\r\n\r\nperhaps be too late for me to make effective use of\r\n\r\nduring  my present term of office, but it shall  be\r\n\r\nready to enable me to continue this fight if  I  am\r\n\r\nreturned  to  the  same  office  of  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry next year. If another  person\r\n\r\noccupies  that office, his task will be  made  much\r\n\r\neasier  because the legislation will be  there  for\r\n\r\nhim to make use of if he wishes to. If he does not,\r\n\r\nit can lie dormant. It is harmless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not believe in letting things slide. I\r\n\r\nhave been a businessman and I know that you have to\r\n\r\npush  things  along to get anywhere in this  world,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  not so in politics, as the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong   Pagar  would  suggest,  Sir.  There   are\r\n\r\npoliticians  and  parties  who  take  a   defeatist\r\n\r\nattitude. Their only answer to all this is  \"merger\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation and until that  merger  takes\r\n\r\nplace, it is futile to do anything\". I do not  take\r\n\r\nthat  attitude.  I recognize that merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation is the answer to our problems.  Sir,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time I do not believe in letting  things\r\n\r\nslide and taking a defeatist attitude. I believe in\r\n\r\ndoing  something  in  the meantime;  and  all  this\r\n\r\nlegislation  is  for  that purpose.  The  fight  to\r\n\r\nsurvive must continue to prevent our tumbling down.\r\n\r\nDefeatism is not good for anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I hope hon. Members will give me\r\n\r\ntheir full support whenever I bring up this sort of\r\n\r\nlegislation to this House. In fact, there are  some\r\n\r\nmore measures coming up to this House which I,  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General, and my colleagues are  trying  to\r\n\r\nrush through as quickly as possible. Perhaps we may\r\n\r\nnot  make  use  of  them. If  some  other  Minister\r\n\r\noccupies my office, he may make use of them. But  I\r\n\r\nlove  Singapore, Sir - it is my home - and I  say  that\r\n\r\nanything done for the good of Singapore is good for\r\n\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee Wednesday, 14th January, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INDUSTRIAL EXPANSION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(RELIEF FROM INCOME TAX)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.26 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

We all know that\r\n\r\nour  entrepot  trade is shrinking, our unemployment\r\n\r\nfigure  is  rising and, added to that,  we  have  a\r\n\r\npopulation  of nearly 30,000 every year coming  out\r\n\r\nto look for work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I support these Bills and every Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  is  designed to help and encourage  industry\r\n\r\nand  trade, I must say this: that the prerequisites\r\n\r\nfor  more  factories or expansion in factories  are\r\n\r\npeaceful  conditions  and security  and  only  with\r\n\r\nthese prerequisites can industries thrive and grow.\r\n\r\nSir,   there   must  be  peace  with   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries, peace in this country, that is, internal\r\n\r\nsecurity,  and peace in industry itself. That  last\r\n\r\nitem,  Sir,  is our biggest problem today - peace  in\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the dignity of labour. After all, all\r\n\r\nof   us  in  this  country  are  the  children   of\r\n\r\nlabourers.  I dare to challenge anyone  who  claims\r\n\r\nthat  he was descended from a Mandarin who came  to\r\n\r\nthis  country.  We  are not far  removed  from  the\r\n\r\nlabourer.  We  admire him, and  we  agree  that  he\r\n\r\nshould  be adequately remunerated for the  work  he\r\n\r\ndoes,  and  that he and his family should  live  in\r\n\r\nreasonable  circumstances. But whatever  we  do  in\r\n\r\nthis country, we cannot isolate ourselves from  the\r\n\r\ncountries  around us. Whatever conditions  we  have\r\n\r\nhere   we  have  to  compare  with  the  conditions\r\n\r\nprevailing  in  the countries around  us.  Whatever\r\n\r\nwages  we  get in this country, they must  also  be\r\n\r\nrelated to the regions around us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in this country there is industrial strife, I\r\n\r\nam afraid there will be no encouragement for people\r\n\r\nto  put  up capital for new industries or to expand\r\n\r\nexisting  ones.  We  in Singapore  are  in  a  very\r\n\r\nprecarious position, because we live on  trade  and\r\n\r\nwe  must  remain a free port if we are to exist  at\r\n\r\nall.  To  be a free port, there are very few  goods\r\n\r\nwhich  we  can  stop  from coming  into  Singapore,\r\n\r\notherwise  that action will endanger  our  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade.  We  can  only  do so when  there  is  clear\r\n\r\nevidence  of  dumping to upset the economy  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  Bearing that in mind, I  would  ask  both\r\n\r\ncapital  and labour to realise that they must  come\r\n\r\nto  an  understanding so that goods can be produced\r\n\r\nat  prices competitive with those of goods that are\r\n\r\nbeing imported into Singapore. From what I can see,\r\n\r\nSir,  wishful thinking and Bills and Acts  are  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to help us at all. What is going to help  us\r\n\r\nis  an understanding between capital and labour for\r\n\r\nthem  to  meet round the table and work out between\r\n\r\nthemselves how to run an industry and produce goods\r\n\r\nso  that  there can be some return for the man  who\r\n\r\ninvests  his money and an adequate return  for  the\r\n\r\nman who produces the goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.40 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government has had the foresight  to\r\n\r\nintroduce a Tax Holiday Bill for their industry  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.

But the Singapore Government,\r\n\r\nafter  looking  at and studying the advantages  and\r\n\r\ndisadvantages  of  the  Bill  introduced   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation,  decided  that we  should  introduce  a\r\n\r\nsimilar Bill in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Singapore is an island, and that\r\n\r\nwe have no resources whatsoever. No matter how deep\r\n\r\nwe  dig,  we  will only find water. The  Government\r\n\r\nshould have introduced this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill  much earlier and not now. It should have been\r\n\r\nintroduced  three  or  four  years  ago,  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  first took office, in order to  protect\r\n\r\nthe   factories   and,   ultimately,   to   provide\r\n\r\nemployment for the people of Singapore. Look at the\r\n\r\nunemployed  today,  Sir.  The  figure  is  mounting\r\n\r\nhigher and higher, and what are we doing about  it?\r\n\r\nI   remember   some  time  ago  the  Rubber   Goods\r\n\r\nManufacturing  Companies appealed to  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Commerce and Industry to prohibit the import of\r\n\r\nshoes  into  Singapore because of  the  dumping  of\r\n\r\ncheaper-priced shoes. The Bata Employees Union also\r\n\r\nappealed   to   the  Minister  to  introduce   such\r\n\r\nlegislation.  But his reply was,  \"Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nfree  port and we either live by it or die by  it\",\r\n\r\nand he said he was not going to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have this policy of protection from income\r\n\r\ntax. Sir, look at the answer the Minister gave this\r\n\r\nmorning. He was talking about the new ruling of the\r\n\r\nCity  Council.  He  said the  City  Council  is  an\r\n\r\nelected  body. What has the Minister done?  Has  he\r\n\r\napproached  the  City Council and pointed  out  the\r\n\r\ndefects  of  the  new ruling? Sir, any  person  who\r\n\r\nwants  to build a factory, as I said yesterday,  if\r\n\r\nthe  cost is $1 million, the City Council wants him\r\n\r\nto  pay 50 per cent. Who will invest money to build\r\n\r\na  factory  if  he  has to pay  this  sum,  whereas\r\n\r\npreviously  he was not asked to pay?  We  have  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  tariffs  also. The Federation  Government\r\n\r\nlevy   a  tariff  on  all  goods  manufactured   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  crossing  the causeway.  Shoe  factories\r\n\r\nhave  closed  down  here. They have  moved  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  where  they know  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nprotect them and safeguard the manufactured  goods.\r\n\r\nMay  I  ask the Minister for Commerce and  Industry\r\n\r\nhow many shoe factories operate in Singapore today?\r\n\r\nHow  many  of  the  people working  in  these  shoe\r\n\r\nfactories have been thrown out of work? How many of\r\n\r\nthese families has he visited? Look at those people\r\n\r\nwho  crowd  around  the  compounds  of  these  shoe\r\n\r\nfactories! Has he visited their dependants?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Why should the Minister\r\n\r\nwaste  our  time by introducing this Bill  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse? The Minister is always fond of words,  words\r\n\r\nand  words.  May I remind him that we want  action,\r\n\r\nnot words?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.42 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  will have to admit that  to  a  very\r\n\r\nlarge  extent we are at the mercy of the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The Federation Government has  thought\r\n\r\nfit to impose tariffs on certain manufactured goods\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  imported into the Federation.  These\r\n\r\ntariffs  have  caused  a  certain  number  of   our\r\n\r\nfactories to close down in Singapore and to  remove\r\n\r\nto  the Federation. I refer in particular, Sir,  to\r\n\r\nthe  20 per cent tariff duty imposed on soap.  This\r\n\r\nhas  resulted  in  a  terrific  loss  to  the  soap\r\n\r\nmanufacturers  in  Singapore. In addition  to  this\r\n\r\ntariff, Sir, the Federation has been able to export\r\n\r\nits soap into Singapore without tariff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about dumping, Sir, I understand one of\r\n\r\nthe largest soap manufacturers in the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya  is also doing some dumping here. For  every\r\n\r\n10  cases of soap sold, three cases are being given\r\n\r\nfree,  to the grave detriment of soap manufacturers\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what can we in Singapore do except to\r\n\r\nappeal to the Federation Government to be merciful,\r\n\r\nto  allow  his little brother at the  foot  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  to be able to earn a living to  support\r\n\r\nits  increasing population! We cannot challenge the\r\n\r\nFederation.  We  must,  therefore,  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation, before the merger - if they will allow  a\r\n\r\nmerger - to  give Singapore a chance to carry  on  to\r\n\r\nfeed its own population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  air  of hysteria, the wild  moaning  and\r\n\r\nbewailing  of  some of the speakers that  we  heard\r\n\r\nthis  morning, are signs that time has run  out  on\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  and  more  and  more  they  become\r\n\r\nanxious for their immediate future. These last  two\r\n\r\nBills -  the Pioneer Industries (Relief from  Income\r\n\r\nTax)  Bill and the Industrial Expansion (Relief from\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax) Bill - illustrate one simple point.  The\r\n\r\nFederation  Government sets the pace, because  that\r\n\r\nis  the  body of the Malayan economy, and there  is\r\n\r\nvery little of principle for us to debate. For  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the Minister for Commerce and  Industry\r\n\r\n(who  is as agitated as all the other speakers this morning)  as  to  why his issues have  not  aroused\r\n\r\npublic attention and interest, I have this to  say.\r\n\r\nHowever  hard  the Minister and all  his  officials\r\n\r\nwork  into the night, businessmen who invest  money\r\n\r\nwant  to be sure that the conditions proferred them\r\n\r\nwill   be  honoured.  The  one  thing,  which  this\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot do, is to offer them., guarantees\r\n\r\nwhich  are  acceptable. Whatever the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry may think about his political\r\n\r\nfuture,  people with a lot of money to invest  have\r\n\r\nconsiderable  doubts as to the  continuity  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the present Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one single factor under our control, which\r\n\r\nwill  set at rest the uncertainty of those  wanting\r\n\r\nto  invest  capital, is a firm decisive  government\r\n\r\nwith  a clear-cut majority, and it is my hope  that\r\n\r\nthe  next elections will produce such a government.\r\n\r\nA  Government  which  in four years  has  not  only\r\n\r\nchanged  its name and changed its component  parts,\r\n\r\nbut   has   from  time  to  time  shown  signs   of\r\n\r\ndisintegrating,  is  not  one  that  is  likely  to\r\n\r\ninspire confidence anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the City Council, let me say this for the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the Minister for Commerce and Industry.\r\n\r\nHe  must  be  aware that the business of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  is to run public utilities on an efficient\r\n\r\nbasis.

The trouble with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister is that very often he cannot  contain\r\n\r\nhimself. If he would only contain himself and  hear\r\n\r\nme  out  to  the  end, he might  save  himself  the\r\n\r\nembarrassment of having made a rash statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the business of the City Council to\r\n\r\nsell electricity and run the public utilities on an\r\n\r\neconomic basis. If the Government believes that  in\r\n\r\nthe   interest  of  economic  expansion  it  should\r\n\r\nsubsidise  industry, or should subsidise those  who\r\n\r\nbuild  housing estates, there is nothing to prevent\r\n\r\nthe Minister from taking a large slice of money and\r\n\r\npaying  it  to the City Council for the electricity\r\n\r\nconsumed by the interested parties concerned. If he\r\n\r\nthinks that that is justifiable, let him do so. But\r\n\r\nthe  business  of  the  City  Council  is  to  sell\r\n\r\nelectricity and run public utilities on an economic\r\n\r\nand husbandlike basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the Bills, all the attractions, and all\r\n\r\nthe  bribes  that the Government can hold  out  are\r\n\r\nonly  worth  it,  if  the man  for  whom  they  are\r\n\r\nintended believes that the Government will be there\r\n\r\nto honour its pledges or its promises. I hope, when\r\n\r\nwe  reach the last item on today's Order Paper,  we\r\n\r\nwill  set at rest the speculations that are  taking\r\n\r\nplace  as  to when we are going to have a  new  and\r\n\r\nfresh  government; first, with the will to  govern;\r\n\r\nsecondly, to govern in the interests of the people;\r\n\r\nand  thirdly, with the drive and ability which this\r\n\r\nGovernment has not evinced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.50 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have, in\r\n\r\nfact,  spoken quite enough this morning, but  after\r\n\r\nlistening to the Member for Tanjong Pagar, to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstatement   that  he  made  that  only   a   strong\r\n\r\ngovernment  can  solve  all  the  problems   facing\r\n\r\nSingapore, I cannot contain myself. Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar forgot what he  had  repeatedly\r\n\r\nsaid - that all problems must wait until the question\r\n\r\nof  a  merger with the Federation has been  solved.\r\n\r\nAnd  now  he  has the cheek to come and  tell  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  all  these problems  have  arisen\r\n\r\nbecause the Government is weak and because  it  has\r\n\r\nchanged its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming from such an important political\r\n\r\nleader as the Member for Tanjong Pagar, this  is  a\r\n\r\nmost  harmful  and irresponsible comment.  This  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  mislead  the people  of  Singapore  into\r\n\r\nbelieving  that if you vote for the P.A.P. at  the\r\n\r\nnext    general    elections,    then    all    the\r\n\r\nquestions - including unemployment -  can  be  solved,\r\n\r\nbecause the P.A.P. can assure you of a very  strong\r\n\r\ngovernment - a    government   with    purpose    and\r\n\r\nprinciples.  But the Member for Tanjong  Pagar  has\r\n\r\nforgotten  what  he  has  repeatedly  said  on  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  platform - that the only  solution  to  our\r\n\r\nproblems   is  linked  with  a  merger   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to hear the Nominated Member, Mr\r\n\r\nR. C. H. Lim, point out certain facts in connection\r\n\r\nwith  the  soap and shoe factories in Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nraised  a  question  about  industrialisation  this\r\n\r\nmorning,   but   unfortunately  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry did not reply to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill. I do not care if\r\n\r\naccusations are levelled at the Government that its\r\n\r\nperiod of office is short or long. What I wish  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to do is to assure us if  it  is  able,\r\n\r\neither  openly  or  secretly,  to  arrive   at   an\r\n\r\nunderstanding  with  the Federation  of  Malaya  to\r\n\r\nformulate  a  long-term  Pan-Malayan  economic   or\r\n\r\nindustrial  development plan.  If  Malaya  is  more\r\n\r\nsuitably  placed  to produce soap  and  shoes,  all\r\n\r\nright,  let it do so. If the Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\ndoes  not want to set up certain industries, or  it\r\n\r\ncan  do without them, it can let us have them. That\r\n\r\nis  the  sort  of  long-term policy  to  formulate.\r\n\r\nWithout  such a plan, a local investor who puts  up\r\n\r\nmoney to set up a plastics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfactory  may find, reading the papers a few  months\r\n\r\nlater,  another plastics factory being  established\r\n\r\nin the Federation. This Federation plastics factory\r\n\r\nmay  be  much bigger than his own, it may  even  be\r\n\r\nsupported by R.I.D.A. or the Colombo Plan.  He  may\r\n\r\neven  find that since a Federation plastics factory\r\n\r\nhas  been  set  up, the Federation  Government  may\r\n\r\nimpose a tariff on plastics entering its territory.\r\n\r\nIn  the  face  of all this, the local investor  may\r\n\r\neither  have to shut down his factory or remove  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  The money spent  on  installation\r\n\r\nwill  have  been  wasted.  Of  course,  labour  can\r\n\r\nemigrate  to  the  Federation  since  there  is  no\r\n\r\npassport  or  visa system yet in force.  But  money\r\n\r\nwill have been wasted on installation. And all this\r\n\r\nhappens  because there is no Pan-Malayan industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment plan. So I wish to repeat the  question\r\n\r\nwhich I have earlier asked the Government: is there\r\n\r\nany  possibility  of this Government  to  reach  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding with the Federation Government in the\r\n\r\nnear  future  on the formulation of  a  Pan-Malayan\r\n\r\nindustrial development plan? Let us be fair to  the\r\n\r\nFederation. \"All right, we agree you have to  solve\r\n\r\nyour  unemployment problem. You can reserve certain\r\n\r\nitems of goods for manufacture. But there are other\r\n\r\nitems  which  you  do not want, and  which  we  can\r\n\r\nmanufacture  in  Singapore. Let us have  them.\"  If\r\n\r\nthat  understanding is reached, a  proper  solution\r\n\r\nwill have been achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.56 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  today has one aim, and that  aim  is  to\r\n\r\nattract  more  capital into  this  country  and  so\r\n\r\ncreate  more  opportunities for employment.  It  is\r\n\r\nstrange,  Sir, that the tune which we hear  now  is\r\n\r\nvery  different from the one we have heard  one  or\r\n\r\ntwo  years  ago.  Those who have  been  loudest  in\r\n\r\ncrying   out,   \"Down  with  capital!   Down   with\r\n\r\ncapitalism!\", are now also joining in the  song  of\r\n\r\nasking  capital  to come into Singapore.  They  are\r\n\r\nasking  capital  to watch out as to  who  would  be\r\n\r\ncoming into power in the next elections. But all of\r\n\r\nthem want capital to come in in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder  to  help Singapore! I suppose as politicians\r\n\r\nlive   and  learn,  they  become  wiser  and   more\r\n\r\nresponsible;  but  if we recollect  what  has  been\r\n\r\ngoing on all these years, we can pinpoint where the\r\n\r\ntrouble  comes  from and how the  problems  created\r\n\r\nhave arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, coming back to this Bill, I would like\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  to  note  that  at  present   every\r\n\r\nundeveloped  country  is  holding  out  a  lot   of\r\n\r\npromises to capital, giving it as attractive  terms\r\n\r\nas possible in order to induce it to come and build\r\n\r\nfactories  here. I just want to make  a  comparison\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and our immediate neighbour,  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya.  Both  countries  hold  out\r\n\r\npromises; both of them have tax holidays;  both  of\r\n\r\nthem  have  all  sorts of other things  which  give\r\n\r\nbenefits  to the manufacturers. But we  must  think\r\n\r\nfrom the investors' point of view. \"Two territories\r\n\r\nasking us to invest our capital there. Where  shall\r\n\r\nwe go?\" The investors will definitely weigh all the\r\n\r\nfactors.  Which  territory is  more  beneficial  to\r\n\r\nthem?  Factors  favourable to  the  Federation  are\r\n\r\ntariff  protection,  a large and  expanding  market\r\n\r\nand,  most  important of all,  a  stable  political\r\n\r\nclimate. What do we have in Singapore? We have easy\r\n\r\nmeans  of transport, but that is about all. We  are\r\n\r\nthe  focal  point  of  communications.  We  are  an\r\n\r\nentrepot.  We  have nothing more to offer  them.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  only  thing which Singapore  can  offer\r\n\r\nthose who want to come and invest their money  here\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  sense of security. That  can  only  be\r\n\r\nachieved  with Government in the lead  creating  it\r\n\r\nand  the people of Singapore following sanely.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore must realise that the  problem\r\n\r\nof  unemployment is one that is facing them and not\r\n\r\nthose  people  with  money. We must  see  that  our\r\n\r\nchildren have a means of earning their living  when\r\n\r\nthey grow up, and the only way of doing that is  to\r\n\r\nsee that sensible people will always hold the reins\r\n\r\nof  government,  not  those who  shout  slogans  to\r\n\r\nfrighten  away people who wish to come to  give  us\r\n\r\njobs  and  to give us prosperity in the  matter  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.  I  have always said that I  am  all  for\r\n\r\nlabour,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  yet you may ask me, Sir, why I am saying this.\r\n\r\nI  say  this in order that we might give capital  a\r\n\r\nlittle benefit. Yes, Sir, we must give capital some\r\n\r\nbenefit  in  order that we might benefit ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe  are helping capitalists not because we want  to\r\n\r\nhelp  them  just for the sake of helping them,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  by  helping  them,  they  will  help   the\r\n\r\nlabourers. We want to give them a fair share of the\r\n\r\nprofits  so  that  we may have a  fuller  share  of\r\n\r\nemployment and the people of Singapore will have  a\r\n\r\nchance of feeding themselves and not rely on social\r\n\r\nwelfare benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next general election is about the most\r\n\r\nimportant  in  Singapore.  By  that  election,  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore will know whether their  rice\r\n\r\nbowl  will be broken or whether it is going  to  be\r\n\r\nfilled. If those who have proved themselves  to  be\r\n\r\nirresponsible  and  have chased  away  capital  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to come into office, there will be no future\r\n\r\nfor   the  workers  of  Singapore.  They  will   go\r\n\r\nunemployed and whatever money Government will  have\r\n\r\nwill be insufficient for social welfare benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look, Sir, at those other facilities that\r\n\r\nSingapore can offer. Previous speakers have  spoken\r\n\r\nabout  the  City Council. I personally  feel,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat if the Government is responsible for promoting\r\n\r\nbusiness   and   bringing  happiness   and   fuller\r\n\r\nemployment   to   the  country,  then   the   local\r\n\r\ngovernment  should also be as responsible.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wants to attract capital knowing that it\r\n\r\nis  good  for the people, I believe, Sir, that  the\r\n\r\nlocal government too should realise that. They  are\r\n\r\njust  as responsible to the people and if they  put\r\n\r\nobstacles in the way of progress, then I think they\r\n\r\nare  not  serving the people. They are only looking\r\n\r\non  the symptoms of a disease to effect a cure  and\r\n\r\nnot  curing it by knowing what actually causes  the\r\n\r\ndisease. If a person is suffering from T.B. and the\r\n\r\ndoctor says, \"Take a cough mixture because you  are\r\n\r\ncoughing\",  then  he is doing the patient  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  of harm. But if the doctor knows that  it  is\r\n\r\nT.B. and  then  treats him for that  so  that  the\r\n\r\npatient has a chance of recovering then\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  is  doing his duty. If the doctor knows that  a\r\n\r\nperson is suffering from T.B. and yet gives  him  a\r\n\r\ncough  mixture, that doctor ought to be struck  off\r\n\r\nthe register and not be allowed to practise! If the\r\n\r\nCity  Council want more employment for  the  people\r\n\r\nbut   yet  obstruct  opportunities  for  increasing\r\n\r\nemployment,  then  they are not a responsible  body\r\n\r\nand are not beneficial to the people!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to this Bill, I certainly feel\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  one  which shows that the  Government\r\n\r\ntoday  is aware of what it is doing and that it  is\r\n\r\nstriving to do its best in order to attract  people\r\n\r\nto  build factories here. However, I would like the\r\n\r\nMinister  to note that although we want to  attract\r\n\r\nnew  factories into this country, we must also help\r\n\r\nor protect our existing industries. Let us conserve\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have and at the same time strive to  make\r\n\r\nnew  gains.  Let  us tell the Industrial  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard,  which  has  received the blessing  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  to  go  ahead with the  job  of  helping\r\n\r\nlocally established industries, or those industries\r\n\r\nin Singapore that need financial assistance. Let us\r\n\r\nhelp  the  shoe factories; let us help the  beehoon\r\n\r\nfactories;  let us help all the existing  factories\r\n\r\nthat  need  a  helping hand from the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCommerce and Industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.06 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.

I was only giving a  factual\r\n\r\nreply to a reportedly actual statement which I read\r\n\r\nin the Press on my return. Sir, I have great regard\r\n\r\npersonally  for  the  hon, gentleman - for   obvious\r\n\r\nreasons - but not for his politics, and I  would  not\r\n\r\nwant him to get the impression that I attacked  him\r\n\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tiong Bahru in his usual way\r\n\r\ntried  to  give the credit to somebody else  rather\r\n\r\nthan  to the Government. He proclaimed loudly  that\r\n\r\nhe  thanked  the  Federation  for  introducing  its\r\n\r\nPioneer Industry Bill first, and that we were  mere\r\n\r\nstooges  who followed the Federation. But in  point\r\n\r\nof  fact  that is not correct because - memories  are\r\n\r\nnot  short - it was in November 1956, in a  statement\r\n\r\non industrial policy which I made to this House (if\r\n\r\nI  remember the date rightly, it was 11th November,\r\n\r\n1956)  that I announced amongst other things,  that\r\n\r\ncapital  repatriation would be  guaranteed,  profit\r\n\r\nremittances would be guaranteed, and so on. I  said\r\n\r\nthen  that  the question of giving tax holidays  to\r\n\r\nindustry was being considered. Since income tax  is\r\n\r\na  Pan-Malayan  subject,  we  then  approached  the\r\n\r\nFederation. In fact, I can truthfully say  that  it\r\n\r\nwas  our  move first, We approached the  Federation\r\n\r\nfirst and put the idea to them. Whether or not they\r\n\r\nfirst  originated the Bill is immaterial. The  time\r\n\r\ndifference  is very small. I am not trying  to  say\r\n\r\nthis to steal the credit from the Federation, but I\r\n\r\nam  just trying to correct an impression which  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member tried to create, and that is  that  we\r\n\r\njust  followed  the Federation like  \"stooges\".  In\r\n\r\nfact, it was our idea first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member then waxed and waned over the\r\n\r\ndelay  in  introducing this Bill. I can  only  say,\r\n\r\nSir, that the machinery of government does not  run\r\n\r\nas  quickly as an individual's can run. Because  it\r\n\r\nis  a  Pan-Malayan subject, there  had  got  to  be\r\n\r\nconsultations between the Federation and Singapore,\r\n\r\nand that of course has meant delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the hon. Member asked, \"Has the Ministry\r\n\r\napproached  the  City Council  on  the  electricity\r\n\r\nproblem?\"  That was the stage, I think, Sir,  where\r\n\r\nyou  indicated that the microphones  might  not  be\r\n\r\nable to bear up with such a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, on this question of the City Council, how does\r\n\r\nhe  know?

There are hundreds of actions that\r\n\r\nwe  have to take. Even matters which are beneficial\r\n\r\ndirectly  to  the trade and which have resulted  in\r\n\r\ngreat  profits, and matters where we try to  smooth\r\n\r\nout  difficulties  that  arise  in  our  day-to-day\r\n\r\ntransactions with Indonesia, are not  heard  of  by\r\n\r\nthe  public  at all, because those are  matters  of\r\n\r\nroutine for us.

In\r\n\r\nfact,  I defended the City Council. Sir, the attack\r\n\r\non  the City Council came from the Member for Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru.  I  defended the City Council and said  that\r\n\r\nthey are an elected body, that whatever they do  is\r\n\r\ntheir  business, and that the Government cannot  do\r\n\r\nanything  about it. However, as a result  of  that,\r\n\r\nSir,  he  has given me an opening which I  had  not\r\n\r\ntaken before in past debates, and that is that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have never come out with what their economic\r\n\r\npolicy  is  or  is going to be if  they  come  into\r\n\r\npower; and if what is happening in the City Council\r\n\r\nduring the last year is an indication of what their\r\n\r\neconomic policies are going to be, then the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment will have no hope of attracting  capital\r\n\r\nat  all.  Sir,  in  the past - I would  not  say  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. - but  sources  closely  connected  with   the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have been responsible for alleged anti-White\r\n\r\nand  anti-capital activities - especially anti-White\r\n\r\nactivities. Let me make it very clear, Sir, that  I\r\n\r\nhave  no  love  for the British but the  PAP, must\r\n\r\nrecognise  this fact and, in spite of  running  the\r\n\r\nrisk  of  being unpopular, I am going  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nHouse and the public: who are the capital exporting\r\n\r\nand  importing  countries today in  the  world?  No\r\n\r\nAsian  country has got surplus capital. Every Asian\r\n\r\ncountry,  whether  it is India, Ceylon,  Indonesia,\r\n\r\nMalaya  or  any  African country for  that  matter - \r\n\r\nEgypt and Ghana - is capital importing. They all need\r\n\r\ncapital.  The exporting countries are the  European\r\n\r\ncountries - the  Whites - that  is  West  Germany,  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom, the United States of America  and,\r\n\r\nto  a  certain  extent, Australia and Canada.  Now.\r\n\r\nSir,  I remember distinctly the day the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar turned round to Mr Sutherland,  who\r\n\r\nrepresented  British capital interests,  and  said,\r\n\r\n\"You wait till we come into power.\" That, Sir,  had\r\n\r\na very great scaring effect on capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Good show!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Now, Sir, I do not say that I\r\n\r\nlove  the  British  any more than  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes, but I am in my right senses. Sir, I recognise\r\n\r\nwhere   the  benefits  come  from  and  where   the\r\n\r\nexploitation  is, and I will fight exploitation  at\r\n\r\nevery  step,  for example, my plan for  a  People's\r\n\r\nCigarette Factory, but where they are beneficial to\r\n\r\nus,  we  want their co-operation and we  must  give\r\n\r\nthem  that  co-operation without strings  attached,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  you  attach strings, there  are  other\r\n\r\ncountries which are willing to give them  that  co-operation  without strings attached. It is  to  our\r\n\r\nown  advantage.  The  real reason  why  capital  is\r\n\r\nscared  and  is not coming here is not because,  as\r\n\r\nhas  been  suggested that this  Government  is  not\r\n\r\nstable and subject to permutations and combinations\r\n\r\nin its composition, but it is because of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThe  investing public are scared as  to  what  will\r\n\r\nhappen to them if the P.A.P. come into power.  That\r\n\r\nis a big question mark which the Member for Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  has  never  thought fit in the  interest  of\r\n\r\nSingapore - never  mind  his Party,  Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\nbigger  interest - to answer and to inform the public\r\n\r\nwhat  the  P.A.P. attitude to foreign capital  will\r\n\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can conceive of one Party being in power in two\r\n\r\nbodies - both in the Government and the City Council.\r\n\r\nIf the City Council is only thinking of how to sell\r\n\r\nelectricity  at  an economic price, without  caring\r\n\r\nthat   the   Government  is  trying  to   encourage\r\n\r\nindustry,  the  policy of the P.A.P. in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  may come into conflict with the policy  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. in the Government. The hon. Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar has suggested that the City  Council\r\n\r\nwill  only consider their job: and that is  how  to\r\n\r\nsell electricity at an economic price, and if their\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy was, if they were in  power,  to\r\n\r\nencourage industries, then what would happen,  Sir?\r\n\r\nThe City Council would say, \"Sorry, we will put the\r\n\r\nelectricity  rates up.\" The Government  would  tell\r\n\r\nthe  City Council, \"Please do not, because we  want\r\n\r\nto  encourage industry.\" What would happen then? If\r\n\r\ntheir  policy in the City Council is an  indication\r\n\r\nof  the  shape  of things to come in  the  economic\r\n\r\nfield,  the people will be scared. They are  scared\r\n\r\nnot  because  of the present government  not  being\r\n\r\nstable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member also suggested that if the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wished, it could subsidize  industries.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this Bill is for an indirect subsidy. That\r\n\r\nis  exactly  what  we are doing.  We  are  inviting\r\n\r\ncapital.  Government says, \"Go ahead, come  in  for\r\n\r\nfive years. You do not have to pay any taxes.\" That\r\n\r\nis an indirect subsidy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, I have said enough on this subject,\r\n\r\nbut  I am glad that I have been able to excite  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of Members on such subjects.

The Minister himself has just\r\n\r\nadmitted that during the last one or two years  the\r\n\r\nPolice  have been making investigations, and unless\r\n\r\nsome  kind of legislation is introduced,  it  would\r\n\r\nnot  be  possible to investigate into  these  bogus\r\n\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, after much trouble in the past one and a\r\n\r\nhalf  years,  got the Government to introduce  this\r\n\r\nBill.  My first attempt was in April last  year.  I\r\n\r\nwill  quote,  Sir,  from the Hansard,  my  Question\r\n\r\ntabled  on  the 24th April, 1957, which appears  in\r\n\r\ncol. 1491 of Vol. 2, No. 21:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Lee Choon Eng asked the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand  Welfare whether he is aware that some  private\r\n\r\nemployment  exchanges in Singapore  are  exploiting\r\n\r\nemployment seekers, and what does he propose to  do\r\n\r\nabout such concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr  Lim  Yew Hock: Sir, I am aware of one  recent\r\n\r\ncase  in  which  four aggrieved employment  seekers\r\n\r\nmade a report to the police which led to the arrest\r\n\r\nand conviction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   a   man  who  had  been  operating  a  private\r\n\r\nemployment  agency.

I am looking  into\r\n\r\nthe  possibility  of  introducing  new  legislation\r\n\r\nunder  which  private employment  agencies  can  be\r\n\r\neffectively regulated.

It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr Lee Choon Eng asked the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand Welfare-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether he has taken steps to investigate the\r\n\r\nactivities of private employment exchanges;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) whether he is aware of any complaints made to\r\n\r\nthe   Police   against   private   employment\r\n\r\nexchanges; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) whether he has taken or will take steps\r\n\r\nto protect the public from exploitation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>A very short reply was given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, the activities of the\r\n\r\nemployment  exchanges  have  been  investigated  by\r\n\r\nofficers  of the Labour Department on an unofficial\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to (b) and (c) of the hon.

Sir, this Bill is\r\n\r\na  very good one, but after going through it I find\r\n\r\nit  is  not adequate enough to deter some  hardcore\r\n\r\nprofessional criminals. A matter of $500  fine  for\r\n\r\nthe  first  offence  is not heavy  because  it  can\r\n\r\neasily  be  met  from an income of a  few  thousand\r\n\r\ndollars  a  month. In Singapore, Sir, we have  many\r\n\r\ntypes of crimes - robbery, etc. -  but exploitation  of\r\n\r\nthe  unemployed  and the luring bf  innocent  girls\r\n\r\ninto  this  social evil profession is more  serious\r\n\r\nthan crime. Robbers can only rob\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthose  who have. But to exploit the unemployed  who\r\n\r\ndo  not  even have funds is certainly  a  far  more\r\n\r\nserious   offence  than  robbery.  Some  of   these\r\n\r\nunemployed  might  have  borrowed  money   to   get\r\n\r\nthemselves  registered  [Laughter].  This   is   no\r\n\r\nlaughing  matter,  because I  was  once  unemployed\r\n\r\nmyself  and I know how difficult it was to get  not\r\n\r\nonly   a  dollar  but  even  ten  cents.  For   the\r\n\r\nunemployed to get themselves registered, a fee  has\r\n\r\nto  be paid, and they might have to borrow or  even\r\n\r\ngo to the extent of pawning their wives' jewellery.\r\n\r\n[Laughter] This is no laughing matter at all. These\r\n\r\nare  real facts. I have even known of cases of  the\r\n\r\nunemployed who have had to sacrifice the milk meant\r\n\r\nfor their children or even the rice meant for their\r\n\r\nfamily  just to get themselves registered. Sir,  is\r\n\r\nthis exploitation by employment agencies not a  far\r\n\r\nmore  serious crime than robbery? As I  have  said,\r\n\r\nyou   can   rob  only  those  who  have,  but   the\r\n\r\nunemployed,  who  do  not  have  money,  are  being\r\n\r\nrobbed.  Only by strict control and heavy penalties\r\n\r\ncan  you  deter  such criminals  from  establishing\r\n\r\nthese  bogus employment agencies. When a person  is\r\n\r\nunemployed, Sir, he is definitely downhearted,  and\r\n\r\nit  is  really  disheartening to learn  that  after\r\n\r\ntrying   to  get  a  few  dollars  to  get  himself\r\n\r\nregistered,  he is being exploited and cheated.  In\r\n\r\ncase  he  has  borrowed the money,  what  will  his\r\n\r\nfamily think if, by getting himself registered,  he\r\n\r\nfinds  that  the  money  is going  into  somebody's\r\n\r\npocket  without getting anywhere? Some may even  go\r\n\r\nto  the  extent  of trying to commit suicide  after\r\n\r\nhaving  gone  through so much trouble  to  get  the\r\n\r\nmoney to get themselves registered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill becomes law, Sir, I hope the\r\n\r\ngenuine  employment agencies will  co-operate  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government by coming forward and informing the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the existence of any bogus employment\r\n\r\nagency.  It is only through such co-operation  that\r\n\r\nwe can maintain the existence of genuine employment\r\n\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this Bill, I see that it is only envisaged\r\n\r\nto  control  employment agencies. There  should  be\r\n\r\nsome provision for exemption of charitable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisations or trade unions. This matter has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  looked into. As far as I know, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nEx-Services  Association  helps  its   members   in\r\n\r\nobtaining   jobs.  I  also  understand   that   the\r\n\r\nTrafalgar  Home  for lepers and  S.A.T.A. make  an\r\n\r\nattempt  to find employment for those patients  who\r\n\r\nare cured. The After-Care Association, which is  an\r\n\r\nAssociation  for ex-prisoners, also tries  to  find\r\n\r\nemployment for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I read in the papers that the President\r\n\r\nof  the  After-Care Association, the  Acting  Chief\r\n\r\nJustice,  Mr  Tan Ah Tah, made an  appeal  to  the\r\n\r\npublic   and  to  big  commercial  firms  to   find\r\n\r\nemployment  for these ex-prisoners. In  some  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and voluntary organisations like  community\r\n\r\ncentres    and   the   Straits   Chinese    British\r\n\r\nAssociation,  they have set up employment  sections\r\n\r\nwithin the organisation itself. Certainly all these\r\n\r\norganisations  cannot be considered  as  employment\r\n\r\nagencies,  because they function within  their  own\r\n\r\norganisation  and  do  not cater  for  the  general\r\n\r\npublic. These organisations also do not charge  any\r\n\r\nfee for registration because it is only confined to\r\n\r\nthe  members  themselves, in clause 4 of  the  Bill\r\n\r\nthere is a provision which enables the Minister  to\r\n\r\nmake  exemptions, but the clause is not very  clear\r\n\r\nto  me.  I  hope the Minister, in his  reply,  will\r\n\r\nenlighten me on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member must realise\r\n\r\nthat  we  are now debating the Second Reading,  and\r\n\r\nthat  he  must confine himself to the principle  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill. These details are details which he could\r\n\r\nraise in Committee. The hon. Member knows that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  proposes to go into Committee today,  and\r\n\r\nif he had any amendments to suggest to the Bill, it\r\n\r\nwas  his  duty to give notice of those  amendments.\r\n\r\nBut  in  any  case,  it does not prevent  him  from\r\n\r\ncommenting on the details in Committee, of  course;\r\n\r\nbut  at  this stage, will he please confine himself\r\n\r\nto the principle of the Bill?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I will try my best to confine\r\n\r\nmyself  to  the  principle of the Bill  or  to  the\r\n\r\nclause itself. What\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  was  trying to point out is that in this  clause\r\n\r\nthe interpretation of the words \"employment agency\"\r\n\r\nis  far  too wide and it does not, in fact,  exempt\r\n\r\ncharitable  or voluntary organisations.  Since  you\r\n\r\nhave  ruled  that I have to confine myself  to  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of the Bill, Sir, I will not then  speak\r\n\r\non  clause 4. Sir, if there is no provision in this\r\n\r\nBill which will cover these voluntary or charitable\r\n\r\norganisations,  then  all the sections  devoted  to\r\n\r\nseeking  employment  for  the  members  within  the\r\n\r\ncharitable  or  voluntary organisations  will  come\r\n\r\nwithin  the  meaning  of  employment  agencies.   I\r\n\r\ncertainly believe that the Minister does  not  want\r\n\r\nto   classify  all  these  sections  as  employment\r\n\r\nagencies.  As  I  have pointed out, these  sections\r\n\r\nwithin  the organisations do not charge a  fee  for\r\n\r\nregistration,  and, apart from this, the  officials\r\n\r\nof  these organisations work without any pay.  They\r\n\r\nhelp  the  members to get employment. So I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is fair that these sections should  come\r\n\r\nwithin the meaning of \"employment agency\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this Bill becomes law, I hope that the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  will  give it the widest  publicity  so\r\n\r\nthat  the unemployed will know that Government  has\r\n\r\nintroduced  it  and  there is legislation  for  the\r\n\r\ncontrol of such agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this legislation comes into force, job\r\n\r\nseekers   should  always  try  to   ascertain   the\r\n\r\nreputation  of the firms with which they  register,\r\n\r\nbecause  in most cases, although there is  control,\r\n\r\nsome  of these firms do ask for a deposit for  some\r\n\r\ntype  of employment; for instance, bill collectors,\r\n\r\ncashiers  and  so  on.  If the  unemployed  do  not\r\n\r\nascertain  the  reputation of the firm,  they  will\r\n\r\nfind  that,  after paying the deposit or  the  cash\r\n\r\nsecurity  or whatever it is, that firm will  vanish\r\n\r\nafter a few months. Big and reputable firms,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  do  not  require cash  deposits.  What  they\r\n\r\nrequire  is  either a security bond or  a  fidelity\r\n\r\ninsurance, and if that be the case, well and  good.\r\n\r\nWherever  a cash deposit is demanded, I  appeal  to\r\n\r\nall  the  unemployed to look into  the  nature  and\r\n\r\nreputation  of  the  firm  before  paying  such   a\r\n\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, is a very important Bill. It is\r\n\r\nbeing  introduced in the interest not only  of  the\r\n\r\njob  seekers  themselves but also  of  the  genuine\r\n\r\nemployment agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in mind, Sir, to ask the Government to\r\n\r\nallow  me to refer this Bill to a Select Committee,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  will give a chance to those unemployed\r\n\r\nwho   have   been  victimised  to  come  and   make\r\n\r\nrepresentations.

Unemployed people  go\r\n\r\nthere to get themselves registered for jobs. It  is\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility  of the Government  to  provide\r\n\r\njobs for these unfortunate people. Such people  got\r\n\r\nthemselves registered, and after registration  they\r\n\r\nmade  daily calls at the Labour Ministry to see  if\r\n\r\nthey could get jobs. In spite of the fact that they\r\n\r\nhad  spent time and money in going there, they were\r\n\r\ntold  that  there were no jobs for them. They  came\r\n\r\nback  feeling frustrated because the Government  is\r\n\r\nnot   in  a  position  to  solve  the  problem   of\r\n\r\nunemployment and to provide jobs for them. So  they\r\n\r\neventually got fed up and lost faith in the  Labour\r\n\r\nOffice to find jobs for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what happens? A group of unscrupulous\r\n\r\nprivate  employment agencies have cropped  up  like\r\n\r\nmushrooms all over the City to exploit the jobless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese  unemployed  are  asked  to  pay  $5  to  get\r\n\r\nthemselves registered in order to get a  job.  Some\r\n\r\nhave  even to contribute their first month's salary\r\n\r\nto  these  agencies.  In spite  of  the  ridiculous\r\n\r\ndemands  made  by  these employment  agencies,  the\r\n\r\nunemployed  still go to them, with the result  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  squeezed  dry. These unfortunate  people\r\n\r\nwith   so   many   dependants  to   support   have\r\n\r\nexperienced the pangs of hunger. I wonder how  many\r\n\r\nhon.  Members  sitting  opposite  have  experienced\r\n\r\nthese pangs of hunger. As the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nhas asked, what did these unemployed people do when\r\n\r\nthey  were  jobless? They turned anything  valuable\r\n\r\ninto  cash. They pawned their goods. Some even sold\r\n\r\ntheir  children to support other members  of  their\r\n\r\nfamilies,  just  to  keep them alive.  A  few  very\r\n\r\ndesperate people, at their wits' end - what did  they\r\n\r\ndo?

The unemployed\r\n\r\nhave  no  faith in the Labour Office, Sir. I  also\r\n\r\nhave  no faith in the Labour Office, and it may  be\r\n\r\nas well for the Government to close down the Labour\r\n\r\nOffice and not waste the public's money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In reply, Sir. We are indeed\r\n\r\nentering  more  and more interesting  times  as  we\r\n\r\napproach the elections which will take place  early\r\n\r\nnext  year.  The Government, in moving  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  of  a Bill to look after the interests  of\r\n\r\njob seekers and to see that they are not exploited,\r\n\r\ntook  just  three  minutes on  the  Second  Reading\r\n\r\nwithout  making  a political speech;  whereas  some\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition - the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nand the Member for Tiong Bahru - stood up to tell the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  how sad  they  were  at  the\r\n\r\nspectre  of  unemployment, how bad this  Government\r\n\r\nwas, and what the Government should and should  not\r\n\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the speech of the Member for Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru first. He said that Government should do  its\r\n\r\nduty  to  find  jobs for all those  who  apply  for\r\n\r\nemployment. Surely no government in the  world  can\r\n\r\nfind jobs for all those who apply for employment if\r\n\r\njobs are not available. We are just trying to do  a\r\n\r\nservice  free  of charge - to try to help  place  the\r\n\r\nunemployed in employment and we have to seek the co-operation  of employers. So long as the  employment\r\n\r\npotentiality  is  not there, the Government  Labour\r\n\r\nExchange  cannot find a job for each  and  everyone\r\n\r\nwho  applies for employment. The Member  for  Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru also said that if the Government had done its\r\n\r\nduty  properly, then there would have been no  need\r\n\r\nfor  this  law. Then in the same breath, he  asked,\r\n\r\n\"What  is  the  Government doing about  controlling\r\n\r\nthese  employment agencies to see that they do  not\r\n\r\nexploit job seekers?\" Sometimes, Sir, in the desire\r\n\r\nto  make  a  political speech one does  say  things\r\n\r\nrather  recklessly without considering what one  is\r\n\r\nsaying   and   in  the  next  breath  contradicting\r\n\r\noneself.  He said, \"There is no need for employment\r\n\r\nagencies  if the Government Employment Exchange  is\r\n\r\ndoing  its job properly\", and then he said that  we\r\n\r\nmust control these employment agencies -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> After the Government has failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - if job seekers are not to be\r\n\r\nexploited.

Quite\r\n\r\nrightly, he pointed out that he took this matter up\r\n\r\nas  far back as last year but he must remember also\r\n\r\nthat since then I have been getting my Ministry  to\r\n\r\nget  on  with the job and it takes time to draft  a\r\n\r\nBill  for  my  consideration. He even went  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  quoting The Week-Ender. He also  stated\r\n\r\nthat   perhaps  the  newspapers  could  give   wide\r\n\r\npublicity to this Bill.

Such  English\r\n\r\nnotaries  public will be allowed to carry on  their\r\n\r\npowers  and  functions in Singapore  but  power  is\r\n\r\ngiven in the Bill for the Attorney-General to  make\r\n\r\na  declaration that an English notary  public,  who\r\n\r\nhas been struck off the roll of notaries public  in\r\n\r\nEngland,  or  has  been  struck  off  the  roll  of\r\n\r\nAdvocates  and  Solicitors of  the  Supreme  Court,\r\n\r\nshall no longer be entitled to have and to exercise\r\n\r\nthe  powers  and  functions of notaries  public  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Malay States, notaries public have been\r\n\r\nlocally  appointed under local enactments, some  of\r\n\r\nwhich  date  back  to 1898, and the  Malayan  Union\r\n\r\nNotaries  Public  Ordinance  of  1947  consolidated\r\n\r\nthese  enactments and extended the power to appoint\r\n\r\nnotaries public to the whole of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, Sir, follows closely the Notaries\r\n\r\nPublic  Ordinance,  1947,  of  the  Federation   of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  It  provides for the  appointment  by  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General, after consultation with  the  Bar\r\n\r\nCommittee,  of local notaries public  who  must  be\r\n\r\npractising advocates and solicitors of the  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt  of  at least seven years' standing;  and  it\r\n\r\nalso  provides for the exercise of the  powers  and\r\n\r\nfunctions  of  notaries  public  in  Singapore   by\r\n\r\nEnglish  notaries public and local notaries public.\r\n\r\nPower  is  given to the Attorney-General to  revoke\r\n\r\nthe appointment of a local notary public where such\r\n\r\nperson  has  been struck off the roll of  Advocates\r\n\r\nand Solicitors of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the draft of the Bill has been approved by\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Bar Committee.

The motion that I seek  to\r\n\r\nmove  today is to end the life of these 24  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and the 25th who has joined us as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  a  by-election. As the last  record  is\r\n\r\nbeing put on in this round of musical chairs, it is\r\n\r\nlikely  that  there will still be many  more  turns\r\n\r\nbefore the curtain finally drops and the music runs\r\n\r\nout.  But what I want to remind the House today  is\r\n\r\nthat  according  to  section 67  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nColony  Order in Council, 1955, the music is deemed\r\n\r\nunder the law to run out on 2nd April, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like briefly to take Members through\r\n\r\nthe legal and constitutional position so that there\r\n\r\nwould  be no doubts in our minds as to what we  are\r\n\r\ndebating.  We are going to be asked to approve  the\r\n\r\nBudget  in the next two weeks. Once that Budget  is\r\n\r\napproved,  the  Government  has  legally   equipped\r\n\r\nitself  with finance for a period of one  year  for\r\n\r\nthe  whole of 1959. According to section 67 of  the\r\n\r\nRendel Constitution, subsection (1) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Governor, after consultation with the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, may at any time prorogue or dissolve  the\r\n\r\nAssembly by Proclamation published in the Gazette.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Subsection (2) of the same section reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Governor shall dissolve the Assembly at the\r\n\r\nexpiration  of  four years from  the  date  of  the\r\n\r\nreturn  of  the  first writ at the  last  preceding\r\n\r\nelection,   if  it  shall  not  have  been   sooner\r\n\r\ndissolved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  it  means,  Sir,  is that  the  Governor  can\r\n\r\ndissolve,  after consulting the Chief Minister,  at\r\n\r\nany  time. But in any case, he shall dissolve after\r\n\r\nfour  years  from  the return of the  writ  in  the\r\n\r\npreceding  election, and this writ was returned  on\r\n\r\n2nd  April,  1955. Unless, therefore, something  is\r\n\r\ndone  to  alter that, this Assembly  fades  out  in\r\n\r\nexactly 119 days' time - 27 days in December,  31  in\r\n\r\nJanuary,  28  in  February, 31 in March  and  2  in\r\n\r\nApril.   What  is  interesting  to  note  is   that\r\n\r\nMinisters do not fade out on the 2nd of April. Sir,\r\n\r\naccording to section 22 of the Rendel Constitution,\r\n\r\nsubsection (3) (b) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The office of an appointed Minister shall also\r\n\r\nbecome  vacant if he ceases to be a Member  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  for  any reason other than a  dissolution\r\n\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will all cease to be Members of the Assembly\r\n\r\non  the  2nd  April, 1959, but the offices  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters are not dissolved. They carry on, because\r\n\r\nthey  have been appointed by the Governor.  We  did\r\n\r\nnot appoint them. So they will be able to carry  on\r\n\r\nwithout an Assembly. The only disadvantage  of  not\r\n\r\nhaving an Assembly is that you cannot get votes for\r\n\r\nmoney,  because that is the right of the  Assembly.\r\n\r\nBut  if the votes for money have already been given\r\n\r\nin  this  Budget,  then  it  will  save  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nembarrassment and unnecessary debate. The Ministers\r\n\r\ncould,  legally, carry on until three  months  from\r\n\r\nthe  2nd of April. That is contained in section  68\r\n\r\nof the same Constitution which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"There shall be a general election at such time\r\n\r\nwithin  three months after the appointed  day,  and\r\n\r\nthereafter   within   three  months   after   every\r\n\r\ndissolution of the Assembly, as the Governor  shall\r\n\r\nby Proclamation publish in the Gazette appoint.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming for one moment that there is no\r\n\r\ncomplication in this new Constitution, the position\r\n\r\nis  this. If we want, so to speak, to live out  our\r\n\r\nlives  to  the bitter end, we go on to the  2nd  of\r\n\r\nApril,  1959. Then the Governor, unless he receives\r\n\r\norders  to the contrary and there has been a change\r\n\r\nin  the  law,  will have to dissolve the  Assembly.\r\n\r\nUnder the present law a general election will  then\r\n\r\nhave  to be held within three months from the  date\r\n\r\nof  the dissolution. Presumably the Ministers  will\r\n\r\ncarry  on  as  a  caretaker Government  without  an\r\n\r\nAssembly  whilst  proceedings  are  taken  for  the\r\n\r\nholding of an election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But under the new Constitution - the Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution)   Order  in  Council,   1958 - it   is\r\n\r\nprovided in section 2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This Order may be cited as the Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution)  Order in Council, 1958,  and,  save\r\n\r\nwhere otherwise provided, shall come into operation\r\n\r\non   such  day  as  the  Governor  may  appoint  by\r\n\r\nProclamation  in  the  Gazette  of  the  Colony  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the Governor so appoints by\r\n\r\nproclamation, section 3 of the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder   will  come  into  operation  revoking   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Colony Orders in Council, 1955 and  1956.\r\n\r\nSo  under  the new Order in Council the moment  the\r\n\r\nGovernor   names   an   appointed   day   the   old\r\n\r\nConstitution dies. The new one springs into  being,\r\n\r\npresumably on polling day under the new Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  Elections Ordinance - which we are supposed\r\n\r\nto  pass  in the not too distant future before  2nd\r\n\r\nApril,  1959. Sir, this is not provided for in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution itself. It has, however, been provided\r\n\r\nfor  in  the Report of the Singapore Constitutional\r\n\r\nConference held in London in March and April  1957,\r\n\r\npublished  and  tabled in this House  as  Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper  No.  Misc.  2 of 1957. Section  54  of  that\r\n\r\nReport, to which the then Governor was a signatory,\r\n\r\ntogether  with five other Members of this Assembly,\r\n\r\nprovides for this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It was agreed that the date should be fixed by\r\n\r\nthe   Governor   after  he  was  satisfied,   after\r\n\r\nconsidering   an   address  from  the   Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly,   that  a  reasonable  period   for   the\r\n\r\nregistration, as provided in paragraph 50  of  this\r\n\r\nReport,   of   persons   eligible   for   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship had elapsed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the House will bear with me if I read\r\n\r\nthe  whole  of that paragraph because it  is  quite\r\n\r\nsome time since we last debated this Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It was the view of the Singapore Delegation that\r\n\r\nelections under the extended franchise which  would\r\n\r\nresult  from their citizenship proposals set  forth\r\n\r\nin  paragraph 50 must precede the coming into force\r\n\r\nof  the new Constitution. We therefore agreed  that\r\n\r\nan  exact  date  for the introduction  of  the  new\r\n\r\nConstitution could not be determined at this stage,\r\n\r\nbut  that it should be brought into force on a date\r\n\r\nafter the 1st January, 1958.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and  then  follows the sentence which I  have  just\r\n\r\nread. It means simply that what was agreed was that\r\n\r\nin  any  case  the new Constitution which  we  then\r\n\r\nexpected was not to come into operation before  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1958.  But, any time after  1st  January,\r\n\r\n1958, we in this Assembly have the right to present\r\n\r\nan  address to the Governor to ask him to  fix  the\r\n\r\ndate  for the introduction of the new Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Governor has two things to consider: first, the\r\n\r\naddress; secondly, the fact that he must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  satisfied  that  a reasonable  period  for  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  the  new Singapore  citizens  has\r\n\r\nelapsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a reasonable period for the registration of\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens has elapsed. In fact, electoral\r\n\r\nregisters  have been compiled with their  names  in\r\n\r\nthem. They have been open for viewing by objectors.\r\n\r\nAll objections that can be made have been made, and\r\n\r\nI  imagine the registers should be ready for use at\r\n\r\nany  time. Therefore, there are no obstacles to our\r\n\r\npresenting this address. What I am seeking to  move\r\n\r\nin  my motion, Mr Speaker, Sir, is to express  the\r\n\r\nopinion  of this Assembly \"that election  writs  be\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  under  the  new  issued  for\r\n\r\nGeneral Elections to the Constitution on or  before\r\n\r\nApril 2, 1959, and that an address be presented  to\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Governor to fix the date for the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the new Constitution in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith paragraph 54 of the Report...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the House agrees to this motion without\r\n\r\namendment, as I hope it will, it means that  on  or\r\n\r\nbefore  the  2nd  of April - if everybody  wants  the\r\n\r\nextra  few  odd days of the 119 days  left,  so  be\r\n\r\nit - the  Assembly will be dissolved by the Governor.\r\n\r\nThen  under the new Legislative Assembly  Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance which we will have to pass, the  Governor\r\n\r\nwill  issue writs for general elections.  The  writ\r\n\r\nwill also name the date for the return of the writ,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be  polling day. This will  presumably\r\n\r\nalso  be  the  appointed  day  on  which  the   new\r\n\r\nConstitution springs to life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the factors which has prompted my\r\n\r\nParty  to  table  this motion  is  the  concern  in\r\n\r\ncertain  quarters at the talk of certain  wild  men\r\n\r\nconnected  with a certain new Party.  Sir,  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  openly  said by men, who ought to  have  been\r\n\r\nresponsible enough to know better, that there  will\r\n\r\nbe  no difficulty in winning the next elections, if\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. or any other Party is not in its way. If\r\n\r\nI  may  quote  the Minister for Communications  and\r\n\r\nWorks - I am not quoting him for what was supposed to\r\n\r\nhave  taken place - in his description of two  former\r\n\r\nPresidents of the Labour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFront, who both became Chief Ministers and who both\r\n\r\nnow   lead  new  Parties -  I  think,  of  all   the\r\n\r\nastonishing things the Labour Front has ever  done,\r\n\r\nthis  deserves a gold medal! In the short space  of\r\n\r\nfour  years, to quote the present Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof  the  Labour  Front: two Presidents,  two  Chief\r\n\r\nMinisters,  both leading two new Parties!  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nare not concerned with the last turn of the acrobat\r\n\r\nas  the elephants dash by. But we are concerned  to\r\n\r\nknow  that beyond any doubt one Chief Minister said\r\n\r\r\nto  another Chief Minister - we are not sure who said\r\n\r\nto  whom - \"Why  not  let us scrap the  P.A.P.?  Then\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing  to stop the Singapore  People's\r\n\r\nAlliance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I bring this up for one specific purpose;\r\n\r\njust to tell the world at large, first, that we are\r\n\r\nnot  so easily intimidated; and secondly, to remind\r\n\r\nthose  who  might be foolish enough to  believe  in\r\n\r\nsuch  idle talk that the power to proscribe is  not\r\n\r\nin  the  hands  of  elected  Ministers  alone.  The\r\n\r\nultimate   responsibility  is  with   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment  who  will have to answer  for  it.  The\r\n\r\nportfolio   is  that  of  a  nominated   Government\r\n\r\nofficial  and ex-officio Minister, and  that  there\r\n\r\nare certain repercussions which the head of the ex-officio, the Minister in Westminster will  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider  if  he  were ever advised  to  weigh  the\r\n\r\nadvisability of such a course of action. Let me put\r\n\r\nit  bluntly this way. May I preface my remarks, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   by  saying  this?   The   British\r\n\r\ndemocratic system is deemed to be superior to a non-democratic one because in a democratic state things\r\n\r\nare done publicly and above board. The public knows\r\n\r\nwhat its rulers are doing, and will support them in\r\n\r\nwhat  they are doing because they know the  reasons\r\n\r\nfor doing it are right and proper. I wish openly to\r\n\r\ncrush  this  mad talk because I think an atmosphere\r\n\r\nof  plotting  and  conspiracy is  inimical  to  the\r\n\r\ncontinuance of the democratic spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put it bluntly like this. If it is the\r\n\r\nBritish  who  want  to ensure  that  the  so-called\r\n\r\nextremists do not win the elections - let us  put  it\r\n\r\nbluntly that they do not want the P.A.P. to win the\r\n\r\nelections - there is nothing to prevent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  from  scratching us out from the race.  There\r\n\r\nwill  be  certain  long-term and certain  immediate\r\n\r\nrepercussions.  The immediate ones  can  be  looked\r\n\r\nafter  by the Armed Forces; but the long-term  ones\r\n\r\ncannot.  There  is one weakness  in  that  line  of\r\n\r\nthinking   because,  whilst  you  can   prevent   a\r\n\r\nparticular group or Party from winning, you  cannot\r\n\r\nmake  another  Party  win. Putting  it  in  simpler\r\n\r\nwords:  assuming one scratches out the  P.A.P.,  then\r\n\r\none  has got to do something about the leaders.  If\r\n\r\nthe  leaders are at large, then, in the public eye,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no difficulty for them to muster,  rally\r\n\r\nand  fight back. It would then become necessary  to\r\n\r\nput  away the leaders. If some leaders are put away\r\n\r\nand  others are not, then the others who  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  put  away will fight for those who have  been\r\n\r\nput  away. If all are put away, there is still  the\r\n\r\nproblem of making the people vote for those who put\r\n\r\nthose  leaders away. Ultimately the result is  zero\r\n\r\nfor those who hope to win by adopting such tactics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say this for the Chief Minister - that I do\r\n\r\nnot  believe  for one moment that he is politically\r\n\r\nan  imbecile. I think he is one of the most cunning\r\n\r\npoliticians  who ever graced this Assembly.  For  a\r\n\r\nman  to  bridge  three eras - 1948, as  a  nominated\r\n\r\nGovernor's  man, into the Rendel era as an  elected\r\n\r\nMinister of the first semi-elected Government - is an\r\n\r\nachievement   not  lightly  to  be   dismissed.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  credit  him with more intelligence  than\r\n\r\nthe people who spread this kind of wild talk credit\r\n\r\nhim  with. But there are other Ministers not  known\r\n\r\nfor  great political dexterity and skill  who  have\r\n\r\nalso joined in such wild discussions, and it is for\r\n\r\ntheir  benefit that I have raised this  matter  and\r\n\r\nbrought it into the open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, once everybody understands what is on the\r\n\r\ntime-table,  two things can happen. The  wild  talk\r\n\r\nceases   as   reality  is  brought  home,   or   in\r\n\r\nprecipitate haste then proceed with their nefarious\r\n\r\nschemes.  I am quite confident that these wild  men\r\n\r\nwill  be  swept  into the limbo  where  all  wicked\r\n\r\npoliticians,  I  hope, will ultimately  be  put  to\r\n\r\nrest -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> With you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - and a saner and cleaner\r\n\r\natmosphere  will  prevail.  Once  this  motion   is\r\n\r\npassed, it will be your task, Mr Speaker, Sir,  to\r\n\r\nconvey this address to the Governor. And, according\r\n\r\nto  paragraph  54  of the Report of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitutional Conference held in London  in  March\r\n\r\nand April, 1957, it will be his duty to set at rest\r\n\r\nall  the doubts and speculations as to the date  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the  new Constitution will come into  force,\r\n\r\nand a new Government will take over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, three years ago, when this Assembly first\r\n\r\nmet,  there was an atmosphere of promise. Today  it\r\n\r\nis  a stale and a dreary Assembly. There is nothing\r\n\r\nthat  can  happen between now and 2nd April,  1959,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  likely to alter the views of  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  had  to  sit  through  dreary  and  sometimes\r\n\r\ndisheartening hours watching men who can never grow\r\n\r\nup  politically. There are some speakers who  mount\r\n\r\nthe platform and who do not know when it is time to\r\n\r\nstop. Therefore, it is useful, when one starts  off\r\n\r\na meeting with such people, to have a sign by which\r\n\r\nwe  give  them an extra two minutes and  cry  halt!\r\n\r\nThis  is  what we are doing today. Members of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  can  take it that my arithmetic  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  weak. In exactly 119 days from today,  if  we\r\n\r\npass this motion the bells will be rung. We hope to\r\n\r\nget  a  reply  from the Governor in the  very  near\r\n\r\nfuture.  Then we will have the last act in which  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  there will still be many more  twists  and\r\n\r\nturns, but none of which will turn this tragicomedy\r\n\r\ninto  either tragedy or altogether comedy.  Let  us\r\n\r\nhope  this play has a quiet and peaceful close.  If\r\n\r\nthere is one thing that we hope could happen anyway\r\n\r\nin  this  Assembly, it is that they go out  quietly\r\n\r\nand  peacefully - and then the hustings. We hope that\r\n\r\nall  wise,  brave, honest, and truly good  citizens\r\n\r\nwill  receive tumultuous acclamation and  applause,\r\n\r\nand  come back with new life and new vigour to open\r\n\r\na new chapter in the history of this little island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.56 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsecond the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that Government should do\r\n\r\nsomething  immediately to clear up  the  prevailing\r\n\r\nuncertainty about the date of the general elections\r\n\r\nto  bring  in  the new Constitution for  Singapore.\r\n\r\nMere   statements   by  the  Chief   Minister   and\r\n\r\nGovernment  spokesmen to the Press indicating  that\r\n\r\nthe   writs  and  other  things  for  the   general\r\n\r\nelections  will be issued before the  date  of  the\r\n\r\nexpiry  of the Rendel Constitution are not  enough.\r\n\r\nWe want more positive action than that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My leader has just now moved a motion which is to\r\n\r\nbring in the new Constitution, and this is to  give\r\n\r\nthe  Hon, the Chief Minister an opportunity to  say\r\n\r\nopenly  and publicly the Government's intention  in\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public of Singapore, Sir, have been amused\r\n\r\nand confused by the gymnastics that have been going\r\n\r\non  in  political  circles recently,  and  the  new\r\n\r\nAlliance which has been formed and known to the man-in-the-street  as  the Rojak  Party  has  succeeded\r\n\r\nbeyond  all expectations in making confusion  worse\r\n\r\nconfounded!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the midst of this shabby political\r\n\r\nmanoeuvring,  the  Government still  maintains  the\r\n\r\nstrictest silence about its intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This  has  cut\r\n\r\ndown much of what I originally intended to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I must say, and that is that the U.K.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  the  only  colonial  power  of  any\r\n\r\nconsequence  left  in South-East  Asia.

Your heart is rather weak.\"  He\r\n\r\nasked  what caused my condition to be like this.  I\r\n\r\ncould  not  think  of  any  reason  then.

I\r\n\r\nforgot to add that the Member for Tanjong Pagar  is\r\n\r\nthe    most    honourable   anakan    tanah    ayer\r\n\r\nSingapura - that means the most honourable son of the\r\n\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next year we will have to address the\r\n\r\noccupant of Government House as either His  Majesty\r\n\r\nor  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara, but still  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to be protected by British tommies  and  the\r\n\r\nPolice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very happy with this motion because it\r\n\r\nwill  fix  a  date  which will decide  whether  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar or I will be sitting  in\r\n\r\nthis  House next year. The Member for Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nused  the  opportunity  in  moving  his  motion  to\r\n\r\ndeliver his Queen's trained English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many months have passed since the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  made  three trips to England  to  negotiate\r\n\r\nthis  new  Constitution. He said that actually  the\r\n\r\nagreement arrived at was set for January 1958. I am\r\n\r\nsorry that he did not enlighten us sufficiently  as\r\n\r\nto  why he waited until today, 4th December,  1958,\r\n\r\nto move his motion urging the Government to set the\r\n\r\ndate. It has taken him eleven months to do so.  But\r\n\r\nlet me tell you why. I have been asked thousands of\r\n\r\ntimes  by  people, \"Mr Lim, when can the  election\r\n\r\ndate  be  fixed?\"  I  told  them  that  I  was  not\r\n\r\nqualified to answer that question. The only two men\r\n\r\nin Singapore who were qualified to do that were the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanjong Pagar and the Hon, the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister. They were the \"abang adek\" who could  fix\r\n\r\neverything for us. \"If abang says, 'Set it  later';\r\n\r\nyes, that date will be set.\" But I hope that is not\r\n\r\ntrue. Sir. What I wish to say is that the matter is\r\n\r\nin the hands of the P.A.P., in the hands of a petty\r\n\r\ndictator,  as  I have once addressed it.  \"We  only\r\n\r\nwant the elections when our house is in order.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the secret I am going to tell. The\r\n\r\npeople most anxious for the P.A.P to be returned to\r\n\r\npower must be the British. I will explain why, Sir.\r\n\r\nThere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  a Chinese story - a travelogue - called Si Yu  Chi\r\n\r\n[A  travel  to the West]. There was a monk  called\r\n\r\nSien Chuang Pang Teng, and there was a monkey  God\r\n\r\nwho  was  very  clever and popular.  He  could  do\r\n\r\neverything. But unfortunately this monkey God  had\r\n\r\na magic ring at the top of his head. When the monk\r\n\r\nthought that the monkey God was playing too  much,\r\n\r\nhe  simply chanted, \"O li toh, o li toh!\" and then\r\n\r\nthe  monkey God had to kowtow and obey the  monk's\r\n\r\norders!  The  monk was very weak but very  clever.\r\n\r\nThe  monkey God was very clever and very powerful.\r\n\r\nAnd  who is the monkey God in this instance,  Sir? - I  hope you will not rule me out - it is the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong Pagar! Who is the monk, Sir? The monk\r\n\r\nis  the  British Colonial Office in  London  whose\r\n\r\nhead  is  the Rt. Hon. Sir Alan Lennox  Boyd.  And\r\n\r\nwhat  is the magic ring on top of the monkey God's\r\n\r\nhead?   It   is   this  so-called  party-supported\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why worry if the P.A.P. are returned to\r\n\r\npower next year; or even Mr Chin Peng becomes the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of Singapore next year? So long  as\r\n\r\nthis  Constitution exists, the British do not care\r\n\r\nat  all.  They can suspend the Constitution.  They\r\n\r\ncan   even   ask  the  Federation  Government   to\r\n\r\ninterfere. So this is the secret - those who are  so\r\n\r\neager and even anxious to let the P.A.P. come into\r\n\r\npower are not only the P.A.P. themselves, but also\r\n\r\nthe British!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second secret is this, Sir, that within this\r\n\r\nyear -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The power  to\r\n\r\nproscribe the P.A.P. does not lie in the  hands  of\r\n\r\nany individual, or even in any political Party.  It\r\n\r\nlies  in the hands of the people of Singapore.

It would\r\n\r\nappear that statements of this kind given by me  to\r\n\r\nthe Press are not accepted by the hon, seconder  of\r\n\r\nthe  motion as public statements. He has  therefore\r\n\r\nchallenged me to state here openly whether  or  not\r\n\r\nthe  Government intends to advise the  Governor  to\r\n\r\nhold  elections  on or before 2nd  April,  1959.  1\r\n\r\nwould like to correct any wrong impression that the\r\n\r\nmembers of the public may have because of the  wild\r\n\r\ntalk  by  members of other political  Parties  that\r\n\r\nthere is in my mind an idea to proscribe the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand thereby make the whole thing clear and easy for\r\n\r\nmy  Party,  my  coalition partners and  other  more\r\n\r\ndemocratic  political Parties in Singapore.  It  is\r\n\r\nridiculous even for me to have to stand up here and\r\n\r\nrefute such wild rumours coming from the enemies of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  If  it  had been the  intention  of  my\r\n\r\nGovernment to proscribe the P.A.P., the time  would\r\n\r\nhave  been in 1956 and 1957, but not now. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  strong  action  my Government  had  taken  had\r\n\r\nhelped  the P.A.P. to survive today. Therefore  any\r\n\r\ntalk of the Government's intention to proscribe the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is definitely groundless. We have done  all\r\n\r\nwe  could for democracy. We have even tried to help\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. to become more democratic and have given\r\n\r\nit the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunity to behave democratically, to the  exent\r\n\r\nof  putting in prison those subversive elements who\r\n\r\nhas  been the despair of the present leaders of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what he meant when the hon.

I am  sure\r\n\r\nthe  general public would be very anxious  to  know\r\n\r\nthe  stand of the P.A.P. today as to whether or not\r\n\r\nthey  are still of the firm opinion that those  ex-comrades  of theirs in Changi Jail are still  their\r\n\r\ncomrades-in-arms.  A  statement  from   them   will\r\n\r\ndefinitely  clear the air so that  the  democratic,\r\n\r\npeace-loving voters of Singapore, will know how and\r\n\r\nwhy,  if  they feel that they should vote  for  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allegations have been levelled at my\r\n\r\nGovernment  that we desire to continue  in  office.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition seem to think that it  is\r\n\r\na lovely thing to be Chief Minister.

It is because\r\n\r\nof my sense of duty to the people of Singapore that\r\n\r\nI  am  continuing  to carry this cross,  and  I  am\r\n\r\nindeed  glad that I will not be called upon,  under\r\n\r\nthe  Rendel  Constitution, to carry it  beyond  2nd\r\n\r\nApril, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insinuations have been made too in the speech of\r\n\r\nthe  hon.

It is not for me to reply to  these\r\n\r\ninsinuations, Sir,It is for the electorate  to  do\r\n\r\nthat. The verdict is theirs, and not his.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that the hon. Member knows that the\r\n\r\nelectoral machinery will require about six weeks at\r\n\r\nthe  quickest  for elections to be held  after  the\r\n\r\nAssembly   is   dissolved.

It may  take  a\r\n\r\nday or two, and then under certain sections of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance  the  Governor  will  have  to  name  the\r\n\r\npolling  day. He will be guided in this,  depending\r\n\r\non  the number of candidates that have been put  up\r\n\r\nfor the contest and the length of time required for\r\n\r\nthe  election  campaign  to  be  held.  The  period\r\n\r\ngranted  for this under the Ordinance is  not  less\r\n\r\nthan three weeks and not more than eight weeks.  In\r\n\r\nregard to this, Sir, I give an assurance to Members\r\n\r\nof  the Opposition that they will be consulted  not\r\n\r\nlong  after this sitting as to whether three,  four\r\n\r\nor  five  weeks is enough; and after this, I  shall\r\n\r\nadvise  the  Governor that it  is  felt  that  four\r\n\r\nweeks - or   whatever  the  period  may  be - for   the\r\n\r\nelection campaign is sufficient.

We could understand him in spite  of\r\n\r\nhis  Teochew  accent, which the Member for  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar criticised. He did create a lively atmosphere\r\n\r\nin  this House. The Member for Tanjong Pagar has no\r\n\r\ntrouble  about his English because he has  had  all\r\n\r\nthe chances of studying the Queen's English and  he\r\n\r\ncan  certainly easily express himself in such a way\r\n\r\nthat  it can be understood that he is speaking  the\r\n\r\nQueen's  English  and a colonial  language.

May I ask him: is  he  really\r\n\r\nsincere   when  he  says  that  he  will  certainly\r\n\r\nintroduce  the  Preservation  of  Public   Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance if his Party comes into power?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Once this motion is\r\n\r\npassed,  assuming that no new laws  are  passed  to\r\n\r\nintercept the proceedings which will be set  afoot,\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  will  logically and  systematically\r\n\r\ncome to its close on 2nd April, 1959. I am grateful\r\n\r\nto  the Chief Minister for having indicated that he\r\n\r\nis prepared to consult the Opposition on the length\r\n\r\nof the election campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr, Speaker, Sir, I beg to move my motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that it is of the\r\n\r\nopinion  that election writs be issued for  General\r\n\r\nElections to the Legislative Assembly under the new\r\n\r\nConstitution on or before April 2, 1959,  and  that\r\n\r\nan  address  be  presented to  His  Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  to  fix the date for the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  Constitution in accordance with paragraph\r\n\r\n54  of  the  Report of the Singapore Constitutional\r\n\r\nConference  1957 contained in Sessional  Paper  No.\r\n\r\nMisc. 2 of 1957.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I shall duly present an address to\r\n\r\nHis   Excellency  the  Governor  in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nResolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid (Assistant Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid):</b> Sir, I second it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>THE EDUCATION MINISTRY AND</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>THEIR REPUTATIONS IN THE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LIGHT OF RECENT DISCLOSURES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to\r\n\r\nhave  to  torment the Minister for Education - he  is\r\n\r\nsuch a likeable fellow in many ways. But I was very\r\n\r\nmuch  shocked by his declaration yesterday that  he\r\n\r\nwas going to be his own judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of us have been outraged by his\r\n\r\nstatements that the school certificates and all the\r\n\r\npassing-out  certificates would not  be  worth  the\r\n\r\nscraps of paper that they are written on. We  often\r\n\r\nwondered  why  he said it. We thought that  perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education did not understand  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of education. But when the leak about  the\r\n\r\nexamination   papers  came  out,   the   conclusion\r\n\r\nnaturally was drawn that, of course, it was because\r\n\r\nyou  could buy these scraps of paper! That  is  why\r\n\r\nthe  Minister said that it was not worth the  paper\r\n\r\nit is written on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been three minor scandals: one,\r\n\r\nthe   English   examination;   two,   the   Chinese\r\n\r\nexamination;  and  three, a story  of  embezzlement\r\n\r\ninvolving a sum of money in the region of a million\r\n\r\ndollars.  I  was  told by the Minister  during  the\r\n\r\nluncheon  adjournment that he  strenuously  refuted\r\n\r\nthis story which was carried in an English language\r\n\r\nnewspaper,  and I would be glad if he  would  touch\r\n\r\nupon it in his reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the machinery of State falls to bits in this\r\n\r\nway, little flywheels fly off from the axle and  go\r\n\r\ninto  nothingness; papers can be sold  and  bought;\r\n\r\nmoney  is  missing; and the Minister  says,  \"I  am\r\n\r\nlooking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  the matter - I have a clear conscience  and  my\r\n\r\nPermanent   Secretary  has   a   clear   conscience\r\n\r\ntoo,\" - then I say that those of us here who have  to\r\n\r\nlisten to this twaddle would like to know from  him\r\n\r\nwhy  he  thinks he has got such a clear conscience.\r\n\r\nIf  I  were  the Minister for Education  and  these\r\n\r\nthings  happened in my Ministry, I would be a  very\r\n\r\ntroubled man indeed. It is no use just telling  the\r\n\r\npublic  that  you have got a clear conscience.  You\r\n\r\nhave  got to tell them why your conscience is clear\r\n\r\nand,  furthermore,  why the public  should  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister should be allowed to  carry  on\r\n\r\nlooking  after what he obviously had not been  able\r\n\r\nto look after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I promised the Hon, the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nyesterday  that  I  would not  unduly  prolong  the\r\n\r\ndebate today. I would therefore like to shorten the\r\n\r\nproceedings  simply  by  asking  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  to  tell us frankly why  he  thinks  his\r\n\r\nconscience is clear; how much money is missing; and\r\n\r\nwhen he intends to tell us the real story behind it\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.47 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I had intended to keep\r\n\r\nquiet,  but  after  listening  to  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar I would like to say a few words.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  pity that a criminal lawyer like the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanjong  Pagar should have picked  out  a  few\r\n\r\nwords  from the statement delivered only  yesterday\r\n\r\nmorning by the Minister for Education, namely,  \"My\r\n\r\nconscience  is  clear and my Permanent  Secretary's\r\n\r\nconscience is also clear\", and made it the  subject\r\n\r\nof  a  debate on the Motion for Adjournment  today.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Tanjong Pagar should have  made  up\r\n\r\nhis  mind about bringing up this matter at least  a\r\n\r\nfew days ago. Sir, I think it is most improper. But\r\n\r\nit  cannot  be helped, since it is the custom  with\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Tanjong Pagar. Only statements  or\r\n\r\nspeeches  delivered by him or  his  Party  are  not\r\n\r\n\"wild\"  talks!  In  the case of  others,  they  are\r\n\r\nmerely  for  the purpose of vote-catching.  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  state that this debate on the Motion  for\r\n\r\nAdjournment is 100 per cent vote-catching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I stated categorically yesterday\r\n\r\nthe   reasons   for  the  leakage  in   the   first\r\n\r\nexamination,  namely the English  Secondary  School\r\n\r\nEntrance   Examination,  and  where   the   leakage\r\n\r\noccurred.   As   regards   the   second    leakage,\r\n\r\ninvestigations are still proceeding and, as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  for obvious reasons, I do not want to  state\r\n\r\nmore  than that. I will give a fuller story perhaps\r\n\r\nat the next sitting of this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has been posed to me as to why I said\r\n\r\nthat   my  conscience  and  that  of  my  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary is clear. Doubts have been raised  as  to\r\n\r\nwhy  I  should investigate matters myself. I  would\r\n\r\nlike   to  tell  hon.  Members  that  my  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary and I are taking every step to look  into\r\n\r\nthe matter. The Police have been brought into this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as regards embezzlement, there was no such\r\n\r\ncase. I refuted that in a public statement on  21st\r\n\r\nNovember in the Straits Times, the heading of which\r\n\r\nreads  \"MINISTRY DENIES INQUIRIES ON EMBEZZLEMENT\".\r\n\r\nI  have  also been asked: How much money  has  been\r\n\r\nlost? What is the real story? There might have been\r\n\r\nirregularities.  Sir, but \"irregularity\"  does  not\r\n\r\nmean fraud or misappropriation of funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Money is missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> There is no money missing. The\r\n\r\nDirector  of Audit has been asked to go into  these\r\n\r\nreported  irregularities and he is  checking  every\r\n\r\ncase.  The Grant-in-aid Regulations came into force\r\n\r\nin  1957.  Many  Chinese schools  could  not  apply\r\n\r\nearlier than 1957 for provisions to be made in  the 1958 Estimates. Under Regulation 88 of the Grant-in-Aid  Regulations,  90  per cent  of  these  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools would not have been eligible for payment of\r\n\r\ncapital  grant. This would have created a situation\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the recommendation of  the  All-Party\r\n\r\nCommittee.  One  of those recommendations  is  that\r\n\r\nwhere  schools  are below standard, every  facility\r\n\r\nmust be afforded to them by Government in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder  to  assist them to come up to  the  standard\r\n\r\nrequired.  In  view of that recommendation  and  in\r\n\r\nview  of Government's policy formulated as a result\r\n\r\nof that recommendation, there has been a relaxation\r\n\r\nof  Regulation  88,  thus making  it  possible  for\r\n\r\nGovernment to pay, in 1958, bills dated as far back\r\n\r\nas  1955 and 1956. Now we must realise that in  the\r\n\r\npast Chinese schools have been neglected for a long\r\n\r\ntime,  and  so  they  are in  a  special  category,\r\n\r\nespecially  during  the  first  few  years  of  the\r\n\r\noperation  of this school grant-in-aid  scheme.  At\r\n\r\nsome  of  these Chinese schools, work of a  capital\r\n\r\nnature was carried out prior to 1957 and the  bills\r\n\r\nwere  sent  to Government for payment in  1957  and\r\n\r\n1958.   The  Public  Works  Department  could   not\r\n\r\ntherefore  check  and certify that  such  work  had\r\n\r\nactually been carried out; but as I said, allowance\r\n\r\nmust  be  made  for  such cases and  I  accordingly\r\n\r\nauthorised  payments to be made  to  these  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools.  The  payments were very small - it  may  be\r\n\r\nboring, Sir, but I will quote here several  of  the\r\n\r\nschools and the amounts given to them:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                                                $  c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Way Sin School             305 00\r\n\r\n                    Chiang Teck School         822 48\r\n\r\n                    Ban Lay School           4,105 00\r\n\r\n                    Pei Mi Public School       822 28\r\n\r\n                    Loke Yung Public School    246 93\r\n\r\n                    Sin Min Public School      676 58\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These might be termed irregularities because, as I\r\n\r\nsaid,  the  P.W.D. could not check or certify  that\r\n\r\nthe  work had actually been done; but there was  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  bills were presented  by  the  schools concerned to the Ministry for payment. As  I  said,\r\n\r\nno  public  funds have been embezzled at  all.  The\r\n\r\nPolice  have  been told. The Director of  Audit  is\r\n\r\ngoing  into every case.
