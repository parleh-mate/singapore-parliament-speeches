Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  motion  before the House is of  grave  national\r\n\r\nimportance  demanding  serious  consideration.   The\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  made  a  three-hour  speech.   The\r\n\r\nOpposition listened in silence because we were aware\r\n\r\nof   the  importance  of  this  national  issue.  We\r\n\r\naccorded,  and  quite rightly, due  respect  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  for  his  grave  pronouncements  by\r\n\r\nlistening  in  silence and with great attention  for\r\n\r\nthree hours. We did not leave the Chamber other than\r\n\r\nto  attend  to  the  call  of  nature.  We  did  not\r\n\r\ninterject but allowed him to make his lengthy speech\r\n\r\nalthough at times he found occasion to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrub  in  harsh  words against some  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  This is typical of the P.A.P. culture.\r\n\r\nHe  levelled  a  lot of vicious remarks  against  me\r\n\r\npersonally,  vicious not in the  language  used  but\r\n\r\nvicious  in  the intent such personal  remarks  were\r\n\r\nmeant  to convey. I will reply to some of them later\r\n\r\non in my speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown was the next speaker\r\n\r\nbecause he had given notice of his intention to move\r\n\r\nan amendment. He started speaking at about 6.20 p.m.\r\n\r\nand  he  was  still  speaking up to  the  moment  of\r\n\r\ninterruption at 12 midnight. In fact,  he  spoke  in\r\n\r\nall  for 6\u00bd hours. As was to be expected, Sir, there\r\n\r\nwere  less and less Members remaining in the Chamber\r\n\r\nand  for  some  length of time  all  the  Government\r\n\r\nMinisters were not in the Chamber.\r\n\r\nThere  was  even  a time when there  were  only  two\r\n\r\nGovernment Back-benchers. This clearly shows to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  and  to  the public the  disrespect  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Benches including the Ministers, have for\r\n\r\nthis  grave  national issue that was being  debated.\r\n\r\nThey behaved in a very irresponsible manner in their\r\n\r\ntreatment of the national issue. At 11.30 p.m. that\r\n\r\nnight,  the Prime Minister and his obedient Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance walked into the Chamber. They were well\r\n\r\ndressed  and  were, in fact, sporting  button-holes.\r\n\r\nTheir  faces  were  red, showing evidence  of  their\r\n\r\nhaving had a boisterous time. In fact, they had just\r\n\r\nfinished  a dinner given to them in their honour  by\r\n\r\nthe  Chambers of Commerce in their belief that  with\r\n\r\ncommon market big money can become bigger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as they stepped into the Chamber, Sir, the\r\n\r\ndignity of the House was insulted and they had to be\r\n\r\npulled   up  on  several  occasions  by  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker. I stood up on a point of order. I said that\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  gave  the Prime  Minister  all  due\r\n\r\nattention  and  respect during the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nthree-hour  long  speech.  I  called  on  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and his obedient Minister for  Finance  to\r\n\r\naccord the same measure of attention and respect  to\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition. In an undertone, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nremarked   that  I  was  siding  with  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis. I was not siding with anybody. I was  just\r\n\r\nstanding up for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndignity  of the House. The Prime Minister  left  the\r\n\r\nChamber  soon  after  this,  but  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  remained behind and his conduct was grossly\r\n\r\ndisorderly.  He  made  loud yawning  noises  and  he\r\n\r\nmuttered  some rude remarks as he left the  Chamber.\r\n\r\nAs he left his seat to walk to the Bar, he made some\r\n\r\nvery rude remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I will not quote  the  Hansard  in\r\n\r\norder to cut down time. As the Finance Minister  was\r\n\r\nleaving  his  seat,  he muttered  some  rather  rude\r\n\r\nremarks.  Quite  rightly, the Deputy Speaker  pulled\r\n\r\nhim up on a point of order.

In fact, I have\r\n\r\nvery  great respect for the Deputy Speaker, Sir.  He\r\n\r\nhas  done  a marvelous piece of work under sometimes\r\n\r\ntrying conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we had hoped that we would be guided by the\r\n\r\nwisdom of the Minister for Finance in regard to  the\r\n\r\nloan  agreement  and the Common  Market.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in his opening speech gave the Opposition a\r\n\r\nclear  indication that his colleague,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance,  who bore the brunt of detailed  work,\r\n\r\nwould   speak  on  this  aspect  of  the  Agreement.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Minister for Finance was too  busy\r\n\r\nduring   the  few  times  he  was  in  the   Chamber\r\n\r\ninterjecting  and  displaying  disorderly   conduct.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we lost the opportunity of being  guided\r\n\r\nby him in our consideration of the agreement reached\r\n\r\nin  regard  to  the loan agreement  and  the  Common\r\n\r\nMarket. I hope his silence so far is not due to  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  he  has  been  having  some  disquieting\r\n\r\nmoments that make him fight shy of discharging  this\r\n\r\nvery  important duty imposed on him by  his  master,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the important point that has\r\n\r\nbeen  raised by my colleague, the Member for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark. The motion before the House, or shall we  say,\r\n\r\nthe  documents that are for adoption, can be divided\r\n\r\ninto four parts: (1)  the implementation of the White\r\n\r\nPaper  Cmd. 33 of 1961, (2)  the loan agreement,  (3) \r\n\r\nthe   Common  Market,  and  (4)   the  constitutional\r\n\r\nmatters affecting Singapore. On (1) , the White Paper\r\n\r\nCmd. 33, the Alliance has given its full support and\r\n\r\nwe  are with the Government on this. There can be no\r\n\r\ncharge whatsoever that we are not standing up to the\r\n\r\nstand  that  we took on Paper Cmd. 33. We  gave  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  the  mandate. They went  to  London  and\r\n\r\ndischarged  it.  The  Member  for  Farrer  Park  has\r\n\r\nalready  expressed  suitable  appreciation  of   the\r\n\r\ndischarge of that mandate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to (2) , the loan agreement, and (3) the\r\n\r\nCommon  Market, these are matters that had not  been\r\n\r\ndiscussed in this Assembly at all. These are matters\r\n\r\non  which the Government has received no mandate. If\r\n\r\nthe  Government is really conscious of its  strength\r\n\r\nin  the  Assembly,  it  should  have  consulted  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly on these two important  aspects\r\n\r\nof  the  Malaysia Agreement, and received a mandate.\r\n\r\nBut  the Government, being a dictatorial Government,\r\n\r\njust could not care less. They thought they had  all\r\n\r\nthe brains with them and could go ahead. Be that  as\r\n\r\nit  may,  we  are for Malaysia. We are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the  loan agreement and the Common  Market.\r\n\r\nBut we would have been in a much better position  to\r\n\r\nspeak on these two aspects of the Malaysia Agreement\r\n\r\nhad the Minister for Finance deigned or condescended\r\n\r\nto  let us have the wisdom of his knowledge of  such\r\n\r\neconomic matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most important objection which we have,\r\n\r\nand still have, despite the explanation given by the\r\n\r\nLeader  of the House and the Minister for  Law,  are\r\n\r\nthe  three  main points which are the subject  of  a\r\n\r\nproposed amendment by the Member for Farrer Park  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Alliance. The first point, Sir, is  in\r\n\r\nrelation to Article 69 of the Malaysia Act, which is\r\n\r\nfound at page 47 of Paper Cmd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22.  We  objected  to this on the  ground  that  any\r\n\r\namendment  to  the Constitution should  receive  the\r\n\r\nconcurrence  of  the  Legislative  Assembly  in  the\r\n\r\nproportion  as  is enshrined in Article  90  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Constitution  (at  page  161).   In   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Constitution, it is  laid  down  that  no\r\n\r\namendment  shall  be  made  \"unless  it   has   been\r\n\r\nsupported on Second and Third Readings by the  votes\r\n\r\nof  not less than two-thirds of the total number  of\r\n\r\nmembers thereof\". The Deputy Prime Minister and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law  stood up  and  explained,  \"That\r\n\r\nparticular clause is in the Malaysia Act, and  under\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Constitution it will  require  that\r\n\r\nsame number of votes before it can become law.\" That\r\n\r\nwe understand, but we in Singapore maintain that the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of  Singapore,  in  so  far  as   such\r\n\r\nimportant  measures  as citizenship  are  concerned,\r\n\r\nshall  not  be  left to just the Central  Parliament\r\n\r\nwith  only the concurrence of the Governor, that  is\r\n\r\nto  say, the government of the day. A matter of such\r\n\r\ngrave  character should quite rightly so come  under\r\n\r\nthe  same requirement as Article 90 of the Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution. Then the Minister for Law  said,  \"Oh,\r\n\r\nlook  at  sections  69 and 66. They  are  the  same.\r\n\r\nSection  66  is for Borneo and Sarawak.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nsame.  Why  all the argument?\" Section 66 refers  to\r\n\r\nBorneo  and  Sarawak,  and  they  are  coming   into\r\n\r\nMalaysia  on  different  terms  - on  more  or   less\r\n\r\n\"complete\"  merger  than Singapore.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional arrangements with Borneo and  Sarawak\r\n\r\nshould  not be applied to Singapore because we  have\r\n\r\nautonomy in a number of important subjects.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will reconsider this  position.  An\r\n\r\namendment  to the constitution affecting  rights  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship, Article 69, should not come into  force\r\n\r\ndespite   its   having  gone  through  the   Central\r\n\r\nParliament on a two-thirds majority vote without the\r\n\r\nconcurrence of the Singapore Legislature on the same\r\n\r\nnumber of votes, i.e., a two-thirds majority. I hope\r\n\r\nthe Government will reconsider that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We who have been described by the Government as\r\n\r\ntaking  orders - it was distorted to the extent  that\r\n\r\nwe take orders - say that that is the kind of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder  the Government of Singapore cannot  take.  It\r\n\r\nmust  be the Legislative Assembly of Singapore after\r\n\r\nhaving duly debated whether or not any amendment  to\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution in regard to citizenship shall  or\r\n\r\nshall not be adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the second Article, i.e. 30 (2) (b) - before\r\n\r\nI  come  to  that, Sir, let me say this. The  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister said. \"Oh, this is the Malaysia  Act.\r\n\r\nSection  69  is for the Malaysia Central Parliament.\r\n\r\nIt  is not for us to decide.\" Perhaps he has not got\r\n\r\nthe  advantage  of  advice from his  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law. No doubt this is the Malaysia Act,\r\n\r\nbut  the Federal Government would not have dared  to\r\n\r\nput  that  in  for the consideration  of  Parliament\r\n\r\nwithout consent Of agreement of the Singapore  team.\r\n\r\n\"This is quite all right. The Federal Government can\r\n\r\ngo  ahead  with this amendment.\" The P.A.P. accepted\r\n\r\nit,  otherwise it could not have been in. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  are  trying  to tell the P.A.P. Government  that\r\n\r\nwhat  they  have done on this is not  good  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. We, who know that we  will  be\r\n\r\nthe  next Government of Singapore - and this will  be\r\n\r\nexercised by us - yet say that it is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to (2), Sir, this is the real nigger in the\r\n\r\nwoodpile.  Article  30  (2)   (b)   that  is  in   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Constitution, that is in  page  144.  The\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister stood up and tried to explain\r\n\r\nit  away. The Member for Farrer Park said, \"Ah,  ha,\r\n\r\nthere is some jiggery-pokery going on.\" Yes, why  is\r\n\r\nthis? That this Article 30 does not read in the same\r\n\r\nmanner  as  the  Article 30 in the  Blue  Book?  The\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister again, not  having  had  the\r\n\r\nadvice of the Minister for Law, jumped up and  said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh  this  Blue Book is nothing. This is  the  thing\r\n\r\nthat  counts. And if we approve it, the  Queen  will\r\n\r\njust  sign it as an Order in Council.\" Sir,  if  one\r\n\r\nwill  take the trouble to examine the Blue Book  and\r\n\r\nthe  White Book - white because it is P.A.P., so they\r\n\r\nsay  it  must be white - you will see that  word  for\r\n\r\nword  and even the numbering, everything is the same\r\n\r\nexcept  where  there has been the jiggery-pokery  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P.; something\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  put in there that is not here. Surely the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister is not going to suggest  that  there\r\n\r\nwas  no  full discussion in London as to the wording\r\n\r\nof  each  and  every Article; even  the  punctuation\r\n\r\nsometimes  was  discussed. So there  had  been  that\r\n\r\ndiscussion  in  London, that acceptance  in  London.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Government, represented by  the  Prime Minister and his very able servant, the Minister for Finance, did bring this up in London, and because it is  not in the London copy, then it could be that it must  have  been  rejected by the London  Ministers, rejected no doubt on the ground that this is unheard\r\n\r\nof.   It   is  contrary  to  parliamentary  practice\r\n\r\nthroughout  the world. To suggest that this  is  the\r\n\r\nthing  that  counts and not the Blue  Book  is  just\r\n\r\nagain  trying  to mislead Members of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nwho   may   not  have  that  much  knowledge   about\r\n\r\nnegotiations on constitutional matters. Oh, yes, the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime Minister says that he has  got  a  new\r\n\r\nbook and that this is an old one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I said a Blue one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Would he be good enough to lend\r\n\r\nme  that new book which he has?

That is the white one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Therefore I say this, that this\r\n\r\nArticle  30 (2)  (b)  - the most heinous paragraph  (b) \r\n\r\nhas been put in in spite of its having been rejected\r\n\r\nin  London. I do not say the Prime Minister  had  no\r\n\r\nright  to  try  and put this in. But the  manner  in\r\n\r\nwhich he tried to put it in is not worthy of a Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  In  his  speech,  he  could  have   drawn\r\n\r\nattention  to the fact that this was put in  not  in\r\n\r\nthe  Blue  book,  but  in the White  book  and  gave\r\n\r\nreasons why he wanted to put it in. He just left  it\r\n\r\nat  that, hoping that by giving us this document  as\r\n\r\nlate  as the afternoon of Sunday and wanting  us  to\r\n\r\ndebate  it  on Tuesday, they could just bulldoze  it\r\n\r\nthrough. Article 30 (2)  (b)  is most reprehensible to\r\n\r\nthis extent, that it has never been the practice  in\r\n\r\na   Parliament   where  there  is  no   proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation. It will be all right in  France,  as\r\n\r\npointed out by the Minister for Law, where they have\r\n\r\nproportional  representation, where  the  number  of\r\n\r\nvotes cast for each political Party will decide  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of seats that political Party shall have  in\r\n\r\nthe Legislature. That would have been all right. But\r\n\r\nours  is not a proportional representation Assembly,\r\n\r\nSir. Ours is direct election, a candidate stands for\r\n\r\nelection, he gets elected. It is not necessary  that\r\n\r\nhe  belongs  to  a  Party. It  may  be  on  his  own\r\n\r\nqualifications, and it could be that because of  his\r\n\r\nqualifications  and  of  his  association   with   a\r\n\r\npolitical Party that he gets returned. But he is not\r\n\r\nreturned  just because he is a member of a political\r\n\r\nParty. This Article 30 (2)  (b) -  what is the intention\r\n\r\nbehind it? The Government know 25-25, Sembawang,  no\r\n\r\nby-election. They will not dare to go there. No  by-election.  They  know that they  are  holding  their\r\n\r\nMembers  in check because of Malaysia. \"Malaysia  is\r\n\r\ncoming,  behave, boys. If you damage  Malaysia,  you\r\n\r\nwatch  out.  You might be like the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nafter  3lst August; they might not be sitting here.\"\r\n\r\nThey  want  this particular clause to protect  their\r\n\r\nown  party  interests in this House. They know  that\r\n\r\nafter  this Malaysia debate there may be one or  two\r\n\r\nor  even  more Members walking across to  the  other\r\n\r\nside in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisgust.  They want this clause just to be  able  to\r\n\r\nkeep them in check. So, I submit, Sir, that what the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  trying to do is not to bring  in  a  new\r\n\r\nconstitution  for Singapore, but a new  constitution\r\n\r\nfor the P.A.P., in the same way as they had tried to\r\n\r\nmake  the  national anthem a P.A.P. anthem;  in  the\r\n\r\nsame way as they had tried to make the national flag\r\n\r\na P.A.P. flag; and in the same way as they had tried\r\n\r\nto  make the Yang di-Pertuan Negara a P.A.P. Negara.\r\n\r\nEven  in  this  they are trying to  make  everything\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  There  is also evidence only  recently.  The\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I refer the hon.

I was just trying to\r\n\r\nexplain  the  attempts of the P.A.P. to make  things\r\n\r\nall their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this Article 30 (2) (h) , if adopted, is going\r\n\r\nto  make  this  sacred  Constitution  for  Singapore\r\n\r\nnothing  but a P.A.P. constitution for the  People's\r\n\r\nAction Party to keep their Members in check, to make\r\n\r\ntheir  Members behave, to make their Members  listen\r\n\r\nobediently to His Master's Voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We oppose the attempt to include this clause into\r\n\r\nthe   Constitution  and  we  would   urge   on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  if they really believe in parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy   and   want  to  practise   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  to drop this one. And we  will,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Farrer Park has said, vote with them.  We\r\n\r\nwill  vote  with them on the Malaysia motion  as  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  with  them  all along  on  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the third point, and that is\r\n\r\nArticle  33.  This  refers  to  a  by-election.  The\r\n\r\nfilling of a casual vacancy. Here again, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park has found out another jiggery-pokery\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. Article 33 of this Blue Book says that\r\n\r\nthe vacancy has to be filled within three months and\r\n\r\nthis  Blue Book certainly contains agreement reached\r\n\r\nbetween the Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the Federation Government and  the  U.K\r\n\r\nGovernment. Otherwise the U.K. Government would  not\r\n\r\nhave  dared to publish this and to make this in  due\r\n\r\ncourse  the  Singapore Order in  Council.  A  change\r\n\r\n- three months here becomes indefinitely. And why  we\r\n\r\nobject  to this is clear, Sir. Experience has  shown\r\n\r\nus   that  the  Government  can  just  hold  up  the\r\n\r\nSembawang  by-election for one year and sit  pretty.\r\n\r\nAnd when they are charged that they are afraid to go\r\n\r\nto   the  by-election  despite  the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nSembawang  seat is a very important seat  to  either\r\n\r\nthe  Government or to the Opposition, they  say  the\r\n\r\nlaw  says  so. The Jaw says the law does not  demand\r\n\r\nthat  we  should have elections tomorrow or the  day\r\n\r\nafter  or  even six months later. Then  why  is  the\r\n\r\nexplanation  given by the Deputy Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Law? He says, \"Oh, this is there.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been  there for a long, long time.  So  why\r\n\r\nshould  it not be there?\" We resist it now  because\r\n\r\nexperience has shown us that with a P.A.P. type  of\r\n\r\ngovernment,  this could be used to the advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe  party in power. Surely in London they must have\r\n\r\nagreed  to these three months, otherwise this  could\r\n\r\nnot  have  been  in the Blue Book.  They  agreed  in\r\n\r\nLondon three months. They come back and try to  make\r\n\r\nit  indefinite. But we would not have minded if they\r\n\r\nhad  tried  to  make it indefinite  and  brought  it\r\n\r\nopenly  to this Assembly and said, \"Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  we  made a mistake. Now  we  think  you\r\n\r\nshould  help  us,  you know. We  have  been  playing\r\n\r\nSembawang for one year: let us have this. So we  can\r\n\r\nplay for two years.\" If they had played it straight,\r\n\r\nit  would  have been all right. But let us take  the\r\n\r\nopening  remarks of the Prime Minister - \"I  shall  be\r\n\r\naudible.   I   shall   be   simple,   I   shall   be\r\n\r\nstraightforward.\" This is not straightforward,  this\r\n\r\nis  the most crooked manner of bringing in things  - jiggery-pokery  and nothing else. Audible?  Yes,  he\r\n\r\nwas  audible.  Simple?  That man  is  never  simple.\r\n\r\nStraightforward?   Definitely   no.   He   is    not\r\n\r\nstraightforward. So, would it hurt the Government if\r\n\r\nwe  say that they should put in a three-month  limit\r\n\r\nto see that a vacant seat is filled?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  they accept the deletion 01 Article 30 (2)   (b),\r\n\r\nif  they accept our suggestion that any amendment of\r\n\r\nthe   constitution  should  receive   a   two-thirds\r\n\r\nmajority  votes  all  these things  we  ask  in  the\r\n\r\ninterests   of   Singapore,  in  the  interests   of\r\n\r\ndemocracy and fair play. We are not asking for  this\r\n\r\nin  the  interests of the Alliance. What the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwant  to  achieve  by this is just  to  protect  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the P.A.P. If they will agree to  these\r\n\r\namendments, these points that we have brought up, we\r\n\r\nwill   vote  with  them  with  great  pleasure   and\r\n\r\nacclamation that Malaysia is 29 days now from today,\r\n\r\nand  it will be a legal fact. Sure I will leave  it.\r\n\r\nThere  are  Ministers  of the  Government  who  will\r\n\r\nanswer to this. But if they do not accept it, may  I\r\n\r\nsuggest if it can be done - I do not think it can - that\r\n\r\nvoting  on  the motion should be in parts,  so  that\r\n\r\nwhere it refers to Malaysia we are 100 per cent with\r\n\r\nthem. But where it refers to jiggery-pokery, we  are\r\n\r\nagainst them. But if the motion is to be voted as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,  it  would  just force the  Alliance  against\r\n\r\ntheir  will,  against their desire, to abstain  from\r\n\r\nvoting.  And  if  we  do  that,  the  P.A.P. master\r\n\r\ndistortionists will go out telling the people again,\r\n\r\n\"There  you  are. The Alliance is against Malaysia.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the great minds of the Government could help\r\n\r\nus  out.  We  are  sincere. We are  with  them  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia up to the hilt. Make it easy for us to vote\r\n\r\non  that.  If they insist on puting in this jiggery-pokery, we are going to make it clear to the country\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  not  tolerate  nor  be  a  party  to\r\n\r\nundemocratic practices intended to prolong the  life\r\n\r\nand protect the interests of any political Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one thing about this loan. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister made great play of this loan. He said,  \"We\r\n\r\nlend  the money to the Borneo territories. No  doubt\r\n\r\nwe  do not want interest for the first five years on\r\n\r\n$100  million, but in return for that  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nassured   of  50  per  cent  workmen  and  Singapore\r\n\r\ncontractors going there.\" So at the Airport, at Hong\r\n\r\nLim and even on television, he said. \"There you are.\r\n\r\nI am looking after your interest. All of you workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore will have a chance to go to Borneo and\r\n\r\nSarawak  and earn a livelihood.\" He very bodly  said\r\n\r\nthat was the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen  the  Chief Minister-designate of Borneo  said,\r\n\r\n\"There has been no such agreement.\" And straightaway\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister jumped in, \"The Chief Minister-designate  of  Borneo is wrong. I am right.  I  have\r\n\r\ndocuments  to  prove it.\" And what did  he  produce?\r\n\r\nWriting on the back of an envelope. This is in Misc.\r\n\r\n5  of  1963.  Writing on the back of an envelope,  a\r\n\r\nphotostat copy of which, it now appears,  is  not  a\r\n\r\nphotostat of the complete writing on the back of the\r\n\r\nenvelope. The Federation Government, it would  seem,\r\n\r\nas  pointed out by the previous speakers, has denied\r\n\r\nthat there has been such an agreement. In the speech\r\n\r\nof  the  Prime  Minister, in moving  his  motion,  I\r\n\r\nwaited patiently for him to state his stand on  this\r\n\r\n50  per  cent workmen. He said nothing. Perhaps  his\r\n\r\nconscience was pricking him and he was trying not to\r\n\r\nbluff  the  Opposition as he has tried to bluff  the\r\n\r\npublic on the radio and on television.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us try and understand the Prime Minister. What\r\n\r\nwas  the big fight that he staged? \"We want  to  see\r\n\r\ncommon  market terms written into the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThat  is  good. We are with him when  he  says  that\r\n\r\nSingapore workmen should be given an opportunity  of\r\n\r\nemployment  in the Borneo territories. We  are  with\r\n\r\nhim.  That is the right thing. We support  him.  But\r\n\r\nwith  his  sharp  mind,  with his  great  intellect,\r\n\r\nsurely  in  the  same manner as he had  insisted  on\r\n\r\nprotection   of   common   market   terms   in   the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  he  could  have  insisted  that  this\r\n\r\nshould  be written into the Constitution.  If  there\r\n\r\nhad  really been such an agreement, surely the great\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister would not have wanted  to  negotiate\r\n\r\nmatters  of a constitutional nature just on a  sheet\r\n\r\nof  toilet  paper. On the exchange of  letters,  the\r\n\r\nlittle  that I know of, the exchange of  letters  on\r\n\r\nconstitutional matters is for one party to write the\r\n\r\nvarious terms of agreement reached, send it  to  the\r\n\r\nother  party and the other party to write a  similar\r\n\r\nletter - in fact, word for word - return to the  other\r\n\r\nparty,  and that is what is known as an exchange  of\r\n\r\nletters. Even the Prime Minister knows it.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  in the very first letter, on this Misc.  5,  he\r\n\r\nsaid in the last sentence of the first paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When you confirm them this exchange of letters\r\n\r\nwill  form  a  statement of our agreement  on  these\r\n\r\nmatters.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There has been no confirmation in the manner that is\r\n\r\nconstitutionally  understood,  and  yet  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister says, this is an exchange of letters. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know.  An exchange of letters that  is  not  an\r\n\r\nexchange  of  letters! A White  Paper  that  is  not\r\n\r\nreally white and pure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Government should and could if\r\n\r\ndone  in the right manner. With Malaysia we are  all\r\n\r\nbrothers.  The Government could still  take  up  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of Singapore workmen for employment  in  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories. They could take up the matter in\r\n\r\nthe  proper spirit of friendship, understanding  and\r\n\r\nco-operation.  I am sure the Borneo Government  will\r\n\r\nwant  to  co-operate  with  Singapore  to  ease  the\r\n\r\nunemployment  problem  facing  Singapore.  But   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should not try to be  arrogant  and  say\r\n\r\nthat  agreement has been reached, producing  just  a\r\n\r\nsheet of toilet paper to confirm that agreement  has\r\n\r\nbeen  reached and demand that they should  stand  on\r\n\r\nthat  agreement  reached. It will bring  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment nowhere. It is still not too late for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to bring up the matter in a  responsible\r\n\r\nand gentlemanly manner with the Borneo Government. I\r\n\r\nfeel sure that if that approach is even taken now at\r\n\r\nthis stage, there will be a desire to co-operate and\r\n\r\nhelp Singapore out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opening remarks just now, I have said\r\n\r\nthat the Prime Minister saw fit to level a number of\r\n\r\nvicious  remarks about me and that  I  would  answer\r\n\r\nsome  of  them  later  on in my  speech.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  brought this in about me - there  was  this\r\n\r\nman  trying  to  sell aeroplanes to  the  Tunku.  $8\r\n\r\nmillion at 5 per cent. There was this man trying  to\r\n\r\nget the Airport. $50 million. Sir, before I come  to\r\n\r\nthat  matter, may I draw the attention of this House\r\n\r\nto  the very important law, the Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\n(Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Ordinance. Under\r\n\r\nthis  law, in section 30, which deals with offences,\r\n\r\nparagraph (h)  says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`publish wilfully any false or perverted report or\r\n\r\nany   writing  containing  a  gross  or   scandalous\r\n\r\nmisrepresentation  of any debate of  proceedings  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly, or of any speech of a member  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly;'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  in section 35, we have the penalty for such  an\r\n\r\noffence. I bring this in now -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what the purpose\r\n\r\nof  quoting  the section is. But if the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfeels that there has been a breach of privilege,  he\r\n\r\nknows his remedy. He has to give notice of a motion.\r\n\r\nI  do not think we can pursue the matter further  in\r\n\r\nthis vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I seek your indulgence, Sir. Why\r\n\r\nI  bring this up is this. It is just to help  people\r\n\r\nwho may be ignorant of this law so that they may not\r\n\r\nfall  foul  of  the law. The Prime Minister,  on  my\r\n\r\nadjournment speech on the port workers,  brought  in\r\n\r\nall  these  things  and brought them  again  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech  on  this Malaysia motion. The P.A.P. radio,\r\n\r\nP.A.P. television, P.A.P. newspapers all did  their\r\n\r\nbest. They had the right to do it, to play the  full\r\n\r\nfocus  on  character assassination. I  do  not  mind\r\n\r\nthat.  But  what I seek is this. Let them know  that\r\n\r\nonce  they  have  done  that  in  a  debate  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly, on the report of a debate in the Assembly,\r\n\r\nthey  have,  under this, to give me the  same  equal\r\n\r\nright to what I say. Otherwise I might have to  seek\r\n\r\nyour  protection on this. It is just fair  coverage.\r\n\r\nWhat  they do to us, be fair to the others. That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I have brought it up, Sir,It is not a question\r\n\r\nof privilege at all. It would seem, according to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government, that it is wrong for anybody  to\r\n\r\ntry  to earn a living. And if you earn a living,  it\r\n\r\nis  wrong. You should be brought up to ridicule  and\r\n\r\nhave your political character assassinated. What  is\r\n\r\nwrong  with  my trying to earn a living?  Trying  to\r\n\r\nsell  aeroplanes to the Tunku? Is he suggesting that\r\n\r\nthe Tunku and I have got a plot to try and make some\r\n\r\nmoney on the side? He brought in the question  of  5\r\n\r\nper  cent.  I do not know where they got the  5  per\r\n\r\ncent. I do not think I could even get half per cent.\r\n\r\nIf  I  could, I would be very lucky. I would be very\r\n\r\nhappy  if they could help me to get 5 per cent.  And\r\n\r\nwhen everything is successful. I might give them  4\u00bd\r\n\r\nper  cent.  Airport  contract? Is  it  wrong  for  a\r\n\r\nregistered firm of contractors to send\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  a  tender?  The tender was not even  successful.\r\n\r\nGammons  got it because their tender was lower.  But\r\n\r\nto  put  it that way and to suggest. \"Ah, that  man,\r\n\r\nLim  Yew  Hock,  5  per cent of  $8  million.\"  Just\r\n\r\nimagine how much it is. \"Ah, $50 million. 5 per cent\r\n\r\nof  $50  million.\"  How much it  is?  That  kind  of\r\n\r\ncharacter  assassination is really beneath contempt.\r\n\r\nWhat  is wrong with trying to earn an honest living,\r\n\r\nunless  the Prime Minister is going to suggest  that\r\n\r\nthere  had  been some underhand work, with  jiggery-pokery with the Prime Minister of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  in  trying to make money? If he means  that,\r\n\r\nsay  so. If not, do not do it by innuendoes and evil\r\n\r\nsuggestions,   making  use  of  the  P.A.P. radio,\r\n\r\neverything pumping over the air: $8 million;  5  per\r\n\r\ncent:  $50  million; 5 per cent. What  is  all  this\r\n\r\nabout? But, of course, I know their intention,  Sir.\r\n\r\nIt  is character assassination. And they want it  to\r\n\r\ntake  effect.  And I must say it has  taken  effect.\r\n\r\nStrange,  Sir,  when that matter  came  out  in  the\r\n\r\npapers  yesterday, I received a number of  telephone\r\n\r\ncalls.  The effect was working. They said,  \"I  say,\r\n\r\nTun Lim. Do you know that Lee and Lee is making tons\r\n\r\nof  money'?  They  are  the legal  advisers  to  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government, to the Bank Negara.

Let us not sink down to the level  of\r\n\r\nthe beast. It is strange. Sir, all this talk. When I\r\n\r\nwas  talking  yesterday,  a Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Aeroplane, ha, ha, aeroplane.\" What  is  all\r\n\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, in his opening remarks, gave a historical account of the steps towards merger. But there had been errors of truth, or some untruthful statements or claims were brought in. The Prime Minister said, it would seem, that it was because he was on so friendly terms with the Tunku since 1959 that he kept on going there to play golf, have\r\n\r\nlunch,  dinner,  and  suddenly  he  wore  down   the\r\n\r\nopposition  of the Tunku. That is not a  true  fact.\r\n\r\nThe  true  fact  is,  and  this  is  borne  out   by\r\n\r\nstatements of both Prime Ministers, that as soon  as\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. came  to power it did  make  an  honest\r\n\r\neffort  to  bring about merger. Everytime the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister stood up to say, \"We want merger,\"  on  the\r\n\r\nnext  day the Prime Minister of the Federation said,\r\n\r\n\"Shut  up.  We  do not want merger.\" It  works  like\r\n\r\nthis.  There had been no desire on the part  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  to  want merger with Singapore,  because\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government  knew  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  been sleeping with the  Communists,\r\n\r\nsince  it  described the Barisan Sosialis  who  have\r\n\r\nleft  them as Communists. But in 1961 a change  took\r\n\r\nplace because the P.A.P. (or the non-Communists) and\r\n\r\nthe  Communists - if you like it that way - fell  out.\r\n\r\nSince  they fell out, there was some change of  mind\r\n\r\ntowards  the P.A.P. Government. Perhaps  since  they\r\n\r\nhave  now  got  rid  of  their  Communist  comrades,\r\n\r\nsomething could be done. So when the Tunku came down\r\n\r\nto  Singapore in May 1961, in an address to  foreign\r\n\r\ncorrespondents at a luncheon, he threw out  thoughts\r\n\r\nof  a  closer  association  with  Singapore  and   a\r\n\r\nfederation with the Borneo territories. That  speech\r\n\r\nof  his on 27th May, 1961, was definitely not  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the Prime Minister's golf playing with the\r\n\r\nTunku, lunches and dinners with the Tunku. In  fact,\r\n\r\nbefore  then there had been no golf playing  between\r\n\r\nthe two Prime Ministers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  all.  There had been no lunches and no  dinners.\r\n\r\nThey  were just as far apart as opposing forces - one\r\n\r\nworking with the Communists, the other strongly anti-Communist. So do not try to bring that all out.  And\r\n\r\neven  in The Battle for Merger. \"This merger problem\r\n\r\nis  really hard and arduous.\" It even made the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister work hard and arduous to write a book,  The\r\n\r\nBattle  for  Merger.  In this book,  did  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister not say that when the Plen came to see him,\r\n\r\nhe told the Plen straightaway, \"No, no prospects for\r\n\r\nmerger.\"? Then the Tunku came down and on  27th  May\r\n\r\nsaid that he was quite happy to have Singapore.  \"We\r\n\r\nwant   to   be  friends.  Let  us  have   a   closer\r\n\r\nassociation.\"  The Plen came back  and  said,  \"Kuan\r\n\r\nYew,  did  you tell me a lie?\" All this  is  in  The\r\n\r\nBattle for Merger. He did not know that such a thing\r\n\r\nwas coming. Yet since it has come, in his speech  he\r\n\r\nis  trying to claim credit - that he fought so  hard,\r\n\r\nhe  played golf, he had lunches, he had dinners, and\r\n\r\nhe  achieved it. Come, come. If it is the  intention\r\n\r\nof  the Prime Minister to write history on this hard\r\n\r\nand  arduous  task, let us at least be  factual.  He\r\n\r\ntalked  about poker playing - that he is not  a  good\r\n\r\nbluffer.  It may be that he is not good at poker  - I\r\n\r\ncaught  him  twice  bluffing and  I  got  his  money\r\n\r\nbecause he bluffed. But what was worse to us is that\r\n\r\nthe  bluff is on the public. To bluff the public  on\r\n\r\nthe 50 per cent labour! That kind of bluff we cannot\r\n\r\ncountenance.  Bluff at poker, if caught,  means  the\r\n\r\npersonal  loss  of  the  bluffer.  But  bluffing  on\r\n\r\nconstitutional matters is to sacrifice the interests\r\n\r\nof  the people of the country to suit the whims  and\r\n\r\nfancies of a dictator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end my speech on this theme.\r\n\r\nEvery  Member on the Government side, from the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister down to even the Minister for Law, keeps on\r\n\r\nplaying  this  record - the Alliance works  with  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, who are the Communists,  to  deny\r\n\r\nthe  Federal Elections and force on us this  51-seat\r\n\r\nState   elections.  The  Member  for   Farrer   Park\r\n\r\nexplained  in  this  House  yesterday  that  it  was\r\n\r\nunfortunate that at that particular time  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the  Minister for  Finance  were  not\r\n\r\npresent,  and  it was really pathetic  that  without\r\n\r\nthese two big men in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment or in the Party, the Government got  into\r\n\r\na  mess.  The  reason  why we  opposed  the  Federal\r\n\r\nElections Bill is clear. This was repeated. Yet  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Press would not even give the reasons why  we\r\n\r\nopposed the Federal Elections Bill. No, it is not in\r\n\r\nthe  Press.  Why play that P.A.P. line of distortion\r\n\r\n- that  the  Alliance is afraid of Federal elections:\r\n\r\nthat the Alliance is now working with the Communists\r\n\r\n- all  that  kind of distortion? We were against  the\r\n\r\nFederal  elections  and  we gave  our  reasons.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park gave his reasons. I  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to take up the time of this House by repeating\r\n\r\nthose reasons. But it may be worth it. We oppose  it\r\n\r\nbecause  we say that the Second Reading should  have\r\n\r\ntaken place after this debate. By then we would have\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysia  documents to know  what  we  are  all\r\n\r\ndebating  about.  The Government could  easily  have\r\n\r\nsaid, \"All right, let us postpone the Second Reading\r\n\r\ntill  after this debate.\" No. An arrogant Government\r\n\r\nsays, \"Let us fix the Opposition,\" and they laughed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other very serious objection which we raised\r\n\r\nwas  that  we  do  not  want a Government-controlled\r\n\r\ndelineation   of  the  divisions.  We   want   equal\r\n\r\nrepresentation   with   an   independent   Chairman,\r\n\r\npreferably a representative of the Federal Elections\r\n\r\nCommission,   to   delineate   Singapore   into   15\r\n\r\ndivisions. We say we do not trust the P.A.P. How can\r\n\r\nwe  trust  them  when they have had Article  30  (2) \r\n\r\nsneaked  in,  Article 33 sneaked in,  everything  is\r\n\r\nsneaked  in?  We have evidence of their attempts  at\r\n\r\nsneaking in things. Give these two points. And  what\r\n\r\nis  left now is this: have an independent committee,\r\n\r\nfree  from Government control, to delineate  the  15\r\n\r\ndivisions. The Member for Farrer Park says the  ball\r\n\r\nis  now  at the feet of the Government. But all  the\r\n\r\nMinisters, the Leader of the House (the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister), the Minister for Law, stood up and got up\r\n\r\nplaying the same refrain - distorting and distorting.\r\n\r\nInstead of saying to us, \"If that is what you  want,\r\n\r\nall  right. We promise you that we will behave, that\r\n\r\nwe  will reintroduce the Second Reading of the Bill.\r\n\r\nWe cross our hearts that we will not cheat any more.\r\n\r\nWe have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncaught.\"  That  would have been all right.  But  no.\r\n\r\nThey keep on distorting the same thing over and over\r\n\r\nagain.  Do  not  say that we are afraid  of  Federal\r\n\r\nelections. We want Federal elections as much as  the\r\n\r\nPAP.  But we want it fought in a manner that is  not\r\n\r\nloaded  in  favour of the Party in power. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  was absent, but when he heard about  this,\r\n\r\nwhat  was  his  first remark? \"Ha, this  unthinking\r\n\r\naction  of Lim Yew Hock. I do not know why he should\r\n\r\nbe  with the Communists and all this, that, and  the\r\n\r\nother.   He  is  denying  the  people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in  the  Federal  Parliament.\"   Who\r\n\r\ndenies?   It   is   the  P.A.P. who   denies   this\r\n\r\nrepresentation. But what did the Prime Minister say,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  his  speech? \"Perhaps  we  have  to  give\r\n\r\nthought  to it; perhaps I may nominate two or  three\r\n\r\nMinisters to sit in the Federal Parliament  for  the\r\n\r\ninterim period.\" He wants to do that. But under  the\r\n\r\nagreement,  which we are debating  now,  it  plainly\r\n\r\nsays  the  manner  of  representation  shall  be  as\r\n\r\ndecided  by  the Legislative Assembly.  And  yet  he\r\n\r\nwants  to do it dictatorially. \"I will send  two  or\r\n\r\nthree Ministers, never mind.\" Stop-gap. He cannot do\r\n\r\nthat  even  if he wants it. He says we  are  against\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  He says that he wants us to vote  against\r\n\r\nthis Malaysia motion. \"Oh, if the Alliance dare vote\r\n\r\nagainst  this.\" This is like a little child who  has\r\n\r\nbeen spanked by his mother for misbehaving and got a\r\n\r\nvery  bad  spanking as the P.A.P. got  a  very  bad\r\n\r\nspanking over that Federal Elections Bill.  He  came\r\n\r\nout  crying  and said, \"Mama, if you want,  you  can\r\n\r\nchoke me and make me die.\" We are not like that.  We\r\n\r\nare  for  Malaysia 100 per cent. We are for Malaysia\r\n\r\nwith more clean thoughts, more clean intentions than\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. can ever dare to claim. The Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park, in his closing remarks in very  simple\r\n\r\nlanguage, simple and unambiguous language, laid down\r\n\r\nthe  stand of the Alliance. And I would like to  end\r\n\r\nmy speech to quote this very important pronouncement\r\n\r\nof  the  Alliance. I quote from the Official  Report\r\n\r\n(Unrevised),  page 39 [col. 478]; and  this  is  our\r\n\r\nstand:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, all I wish to say is this. We are for\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I  ask  the Government  not  to  make  it\r\n\r\ndifficult for us to vote with them on this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotion. While we are for Malaysia, we are even  more\r\n\r\nso for Singapore. It is because we love Singapore so\r\n\r\nmuch  that we go into Malaysia. Now, if in going  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia, some jiggery-pokery is going to be done to\r\n\r\nSingapore, to preserve some party interests, we  are\r\n\r\nnot  going to be a party to that. We cannot  and  we\r\n\r\nmust not. The Alliance makes this offer that if they\r\n\r\nsupport  this amendment we will whole-heartedly  and\r\n\r\nwith  great  pleasure vote with them on the  motion,\r\n\r\nbut  if  they  deny us this and defeat  us  on  this\r\n\r\namendment, it is with the utmost regret that we will\r\n\r\nhave to refrain from voting on a matter on which  we\r\n\r\nare  so vitally concerned and connected. I hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not force us into that position.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government wants to force us into that\r\n\r\nposition, I would ask it to do it in a way  that  is\r\n\r\nmore honest and clean. Arrange it in such a way that\r\n\r\nthe voting can be in parts, if it can be done. If it\r\n\r\ncannot be done, then it cannot be done. If it can be\r\n\r\ndone  in  parts - Malaysia? Aye. Common Market?  Aye.\r\n\r\nLoan Agreement? Aye. P.A.P. cheat? No, no, no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee) and Mr Marshall</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated that perhaps it is\r\n\r\nbest,  since  there is going to be a  guillotine  on\r\n\r\nthis  motion,  that  we  hear  all  views  from  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  side  first.

They were thrice defeated in two days.

But\r\n\r\nlet us recognise that if we for a moment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthought that they were heroes or even that they were\r\n\r\nsuccessful,  they  would  not  have  received   that\r\n\r\nreception so soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have Cmd. 22 of 1963. To us in Singapore it is primarily a funeral service for the port and the people of Singapore. It contains, however, Mr Speaker, certain lunatic aspects which it might be interesting to touch upon before we come to the main issue. I ask you to look at the first page of this document whose counterpart was tabled\r\n\r\nin  England  at the United Kingdom Parliament  about\r\n\r\nthe middle of this month, but which we received only\r\n\r\non Sunday afternoon. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Agreement concluded between the United Kingdom of\r\n\r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, the Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then if you look at Article I, Sir, page 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern\r\n\r\nIreland, the Federation of Malaya, North Borneo.\r\n\r\nSarawak and Singapore;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desiring to conclude an agreement relating to\r\n\r\nMalaysia;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agree as follows:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">Article I</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colonies of North Borneo and Sarawak and the\r\n\r\nState  of  Singapore  shall be  federated  with  the\r\n\r\nexisting   States   ... in  accordance   with   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional   instruments   annexed    to    this\r\n\r\nAgreement...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us look at Article III:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of the United Kingdom will submit\r\n\r\nto  Her Britannic Majesty before Malaysia Day Orders\r\n\r\nin  Council for the purpose of giving the  force  of\r\n\r\nlaw to the Constitutions of Sabah, Sarawak and Singa\r\n\r\npore  as  States of Malaysia which are  set  out  in\r\n\r\nAnnexes B, C and D.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Ours is \"C\", Mr Speaker. And finally. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nif I might refer to Article IV -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. To put the record straight,\r\n\r\nwhen the hon. Member said \"ours\" I take it he meant\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Constitution.

According  to  this  document,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  Annex  D - by the way, before  we  finish\r\n\r\nthat,  if  you will look, Mr Speaker, at  the  last\r\n\r\nsentence  at page 3: \"Done at London this Ninth  day\r\n\r\nof July, 1963 ...\". Signed by the Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nthe Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Finance. So according to this document,  it  is\r\n\r\nalleged that Annex D is the Annex which was attached\r\n\r\nto the Agreement executed on the 9th of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there was in England tabled in Parliament a White Paper known as Cmd. 2094. I understand you have a copy. I table an additional one, Mr Speaker. It is impossible to obtain this in any bookshop in Singapore, and I succeeded in obtaining some airmail copies. It contains the identical instruments with the addition of an index.\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  there  are  variations  between  the\r\n\r\nSingapore White Paper and the White Paper tabled  by\r\n\r\nHer  Britannic Majesty's Government to  the  British\r\n\r\nParliament. And I say to you. Mr Speaker, it  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  whether we are to believe the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment's White Paper tabled in Parliament or the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's White Paper. Anybody who hesitates\r\n\r\nshould be in Woodbridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has drawn your\r\n\r\nattention  to two major falsehoods in this  forgery.\r\n\r\nThis  Article  30 (2)  (b)  is an interpolation  which\r\n\r\ndoes  not  appear at page 146 of the  British  White\r\n\r\nPaper.  He has also drawn your attention to  Article\r\n\r\n33   wherein  in  our  White  Paper  we  delete  the\r\n\r\nprovision requiring that by-elections should be held\r\n\r\nwithin three months. Now we can understand fully the\r\n\r\ndishonesty  of the constant procrastination  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Sembawang by-election.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  if  you remember, Mr Speaker, that  the  last\r\n\r\ntime  I  asked that question in April, they promised\r\n\r\nthe  election would be held within two months.  That\r\n\r\nwas April. It was always the excuse of the electoral\r\n\r\nroll.  They  proceed  on  the  basis,  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nparticularly the Minister for Culture, that it  does\r\n\r\nnot  matter  what falsehood you utter. It  does  not\r\n\r\nmatter! The power lies in the barrel of the gun  and\r\n\r\nas  their  leader, the Prime Minister, has said,  \"I\r\n\r\nagree with Humpty Dumpty, a word means what I say it\r\n\r\nmeans.\"  And  so  long as they are in  power,  their\r\n\r\nfalsehoods which they can impose upon the Press  and\r\n\r\nthe radio, and organs of mass dissemination of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnews,  it  does  not  matter  what  falsehoods  they\r\n\r\npropagate.  It does not matter that everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthat  they are dishonest. They consider that a sense\r\n\r\nof shame is an absurd adjunct to a political adult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I would like, apart from those\r\n\r\nmatters which were drawn to your attention, to  draw\r\n\r\nyour attention to other falsehoods in this document,\r\n\r\nthis  false document which you are asked  to  adopt.\r\n\r\nPage  142, section 24 (4)  (c) . The second last  line\r\n\r\nof   that  section.  \"paragraph  (e) \"  should   read\r\n\r\n\"paragraph (d) \". It is intentional, Mr Speaker.  It\r\n\r\nis  not our Printer's error. Page 142 of Singapore's\r\n\r\nWhite Paper and page 144 of the British White Paper.\r\n\r\nIf I might go on to the next one. Article 32 (b) , at\r\n\r\npage  154, of our White Paper, and page 147  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish White Paper, the last line of that paragraph\r\n\r\nreading:  `or paragraph (e) ' should read  `paragraph\r\n\r\n(d) '. Again a falsehood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> What page is it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Forgive me.

Article 32 (b). `... by virtue of\r\n\r\nparagraph (a)  or paragraph [it should read]  (d)   of\r\n\r\nclause (2) ...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister, who is a lawyer and who next month will be a lawyer again, if he tries to do this in a court of law, knows he will get straight into gaol. Imagine him putting in a statement of claim with alleged amendments. \"I am not trying to defraud the court.\" But he can do it to us. Power is in the barrel of the gun. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we  purport to follow  the  traditions  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy, evolved by another great nation,  and  it\r\n\r\nis   a   pity   that  none  of  `is  have   adequate\r\n\r\nunderstanding  that  the  barrel  of  the   gun   is\r\n\r\ninappropriate for democratic traditions. And perhaps\r\n\r\nnone  on  the  Front bench have an understanding  of\r\n\r\nthat  doggerel  which has recently  gained  so  much\r\n\r\npublicity. \"To lie in the House is obscene.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw your attention to another lunatic aspect of\r\n\r\nthis  motion and the documents tabled. I  draw  your\r\n\r\nattention to Misc. 5 of 1963 which states that it is\r\n\r\nan  exchange of letters. It seems to be more a  one-way  traffic than an exchange. It starts off with  a\r\n\r\nletter of 8th July\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwritten  by  the Prime Minister after the  purported\r\n\r\ninterview  with  the envelope.  I  draw  again  your\r\n\r\nattention to that paragraph to which the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  drew attention, but he did  not  conclude\r\n\r\nthe lesson. \"When you confirm them this exchange  of\r\n\r\nletters  will  form a statement of our agreement  on\r\n\r\nthese  matters.\" So if you do not confirm them,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, there is no agreement. I repeat the  words.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister's words to Tun Abdul Razak. \"When\r\n\r\nyou  confirm them this exchange of letters will form\r\n\r\na  statement of our agreement ...'. Mr Speaker,  let\r\n\r\nus look at the second paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Firstly, it is agreed that any law enacted by\r\n\r\nParliament  under  Article  9  (3)   of  the  Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution which imposes restrictions  in  respect\r\n\r\nof  movement and residence as between the States  of\r\n\r\nMalaya and Singapore will have reciprocal effect  so\r\n\r\nthat  any restrictions imposed on Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nas  regards movement or residence in the  States  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  will equally apply to citizens of  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwho are Singapore citizens, ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  does it mean? So that any provisions apply  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens shall mean that  they  apply  to\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens? Somebody slipped? Because if  we\r\n\r\nlook  at the only confirmation we have, which is  an\r\n\r\nundated  letter of July signed by the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister on the next page, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the event of the Federation Government\r\n\r\nintroducing legislation under Article 9 (3)   of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  of  Malaysia imposing restrictions  as\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and the States of Malaya  on  the\r\n\r\nright conferred by Article 9 (2), I agree that  such\r\n\r\nrestrictions should be reciprocal.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  I  take  it, it would mean also in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthose who are not Singapore citizens - the word \"not\"\r\n\r\nhaving  been  left out - not being able  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us look at \"secondly\" which was never ever\r\n\r\nconfirmed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Secondly, it is agreed that there will be no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination in the application of the fundamental\r\n\r\nrights   provisions  in  Part  II  of  the   Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution against Singapore citizens  other  than\r\n\r\nthose  which  have been agreed and included  in  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Bill ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  is it not important to have  that  at \r\n\r\nleast in the Constitution, let alone an exchange  of \r\n\r\nletters?  There is not even a confirmation of  that. \r\n\r\nIt goes on to read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... and that any possible modifications in the\r\n\r\nfuture  of these fundamental rights provisions  will\r\n\r\napply equally to all citizens of Malaysia, including\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens and that no modifications will be\r\n\r\nmade against Singapore citizens only.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Where  is  the confirmation of \"secondly\"\r\n\r\n- a  vital matter  which  he  now goes to the  point  of  being\r\n\r\nsatisfied  if it is in a letter from not  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  but  the  Deputy Prime  Minister?  One  is\r\n\r\nreminded,  Mr  Speaker, of a snotty urchin  playing\r\n\r\nmarbles in a back alley!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thirdly, in accordance with section 98, there\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  Bill.  If you will look  at  this,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  it is curious the number of mistakes  that\r\n\r\none finds in the conduct of these Gentlemen who must\r\n\r\nhave  found  themselves foreigners in the  political\r\n\r\nstratosphere  wherein they had to  negotiate.  There\r\n\r\nare  nine points, not eight in this letter,  because\r\n\r\nhe  refers  to  it  later as an eight-point  letter.\r\n\r\nThere is a \"lastly\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Lastly, it is agreed that the Governments of the\r\n\r\nFederation   and   of  Singapore  will   take   such\r\n\r\nlegislative,  executive or other action  as  may  be\r\n\r\nrequired  to  implement the assurances, undertakings\r\n\r\nand   recommendations   of  the   Inter-Governmental\r\n\r\nCommittee on Merger and its Sub-Committees in so far\r\n\r\nas  these  have  not  been subsequently  amended  or\r\n\r\nimplemented   by   express   provisions    of    the\r\n\r\nConstitution ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr   Speaker,  he  was  trying  to  do   what   the \r\n\r\nGovernments   of  North  Borneo  and   Sarawak   had \r\n\r\nobtained. Might I for a moment ask you to look  back \r\n\r\nto  Article VIII of the Agreement, page 2,  in  Cmd.\r\n\r\nPaper 22 of 1963? You will see there:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Governments of the Federation of Malaya,\r\n\r\nNorth  Borneo  and Sarawak [but not Singapore,  Sir]\r\n\r\nwill  take  such  legislative,  executive  or  other\r\n\r\naction   as   may  be  required  to  implement   the\r\n\r\nassurances,    undertakings   and    recommendations\r\n\r\ncontained in Chapter 3 of, and Annexes A and  B  to,\r\n\r\nthe   Report  of  the  Inter-Governmental  Committee\r\n\r\nsigned on 27th February, 1963, in so far as they are\r\n\r\nnot   implemented  by  express  provision   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution of Malaysia.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  that is a solemn document, Mr Speaker,  signed\r\n\r\nby  the  three Governments on 9th July. He is merely\r\n\r\ntrying  to get an exchange of letters which he  does\r\n\r\nnot get. He says, can I have your assurance that - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... it is agreed that the Governments of the\r\n\r\nFederation and Singapore will take such legislative,\r\n\r\nexecutive or other action\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  may  be  required to implement  the  assurances,\r\n\r\nundertakings  and  recommendations  of  the   Inter-Governmental Committee on Merger...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have now this nine-point letter to which\r\n\r\nhe  gets one agreement - and only one - leaving  eight\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will see next a letter of the 10th of July\r\n\r\n- that is, two days after this purported agreement on\r\n\r\nthe  back of an envelope! That is how he deals  with\r\n\r\nthe fate of our people:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`My dear Prime Minister,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to our discussion on the evening of 8th\r\n\r\nJuly  at  the  Ritz Hotel as a result  of  which  we\r\n\r\nagreed:' -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  you  see, Sir, it was the evening of the 8th  of\r\n\r\nJuly, because if you will look at the next document,\r\n\r\nit  starts off by saying that it was the 8th of June\r\n\r\nand  it was changed to the 8th of July. That  is  in\r\n\r\nthe  handwriting of our Prime Minister, whereas  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of the Federation says it was the 7th\r\n\r\nof July. Do you see that, Mr Speaker? Now let us go\r\n\r\nback:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I refer to our discussion on the evening of 8th\r\n\r\nJuly  at  the  Ritz Hotel as a result  of  which  we\r\n\r\nagreed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) in respect of the loan for the development of\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo States, no labourers will be engaged\r\n\r\nfrom   outside  Malaysia  for  the   development\r\n\r\nprojects  and that 50 per cent of such labourers\r\n\r\nshall be supplied from Singapore;'-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Ho has  now forgotten about our fundamental rights to  which  he referred in the third paragraph of his letter of the 8th  that  hereafter there will be no discrimination or  legislation  against  the  people  of  Singapore specifically a thing about which we have been deeply worried  throughout the merger debate. This has  now\r\n\r\nbeen forgotten. Does he get a reply, Mr Speaker? He\r\n\r\nattaches  this  back  of an  envelope  and  he  gets\r\n\r\ntreated  with  the  contempt that he  deserves  - the\r\n\r\nletter   of  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya dated 18th! It  is  with  pain\r\n\r\nthat  I  see our Government - whatever we  may  think\r\n\r\nabout it - being treated in this way from outside:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>`Dear Prime Minister,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[the last sentence] I am, therefore, returning\r\n\r\nthem [the letters] to you.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Let me read the whole letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`You will remember that shortly before the signing\r\n\r\nof  the  formal  agreement for the establishment  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in London on 8th July, 1963, you forwarded\r\n\r\na  number  of  claims  on behalf  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the form of letters. As a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe  discussions between Tunku and yourself and  the\r\n\r\nunderstanding reached between you it was agreed that\r\n\r\nthere was no need to reply further to these letters.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, returning them to you herewith.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  gets his little envelope and he gets his letters\r\n\r\nand  he  gets  no  confirmation of  the  fundamental\r\n\r\nrights   of   the   people  of   Singapore   of   no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination, or 50 per cent labour - nothing. That\r\n\r\nis   the   way   our   Prime  Minister   negotiates.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] What did he say? We cannot blame them\r\n\r\nfor  smarting.  He  took a long time  to  reply.  He\r\n\r\nfinally did on 22nd July:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have your letter of 18th July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can ignore the letter containing\r\n\r\nthe eight points ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Which  letter  containing  the  eight  points,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker? If he means the letter of the 8th of  July,\r\n\r\nit contains nine points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe  said \"eighthly\" and then the last paragraph says\r\n\r\n\"lastly\".  Lastly does not mean that  it  is  not  a\r\n\r\npoint at all. I will continue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I do not think we can ignore the letter\r\n\r\ncontaining  the eight points because the note  which\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku  signed said that the last part  of  this\r\n\r\nletter about the Inter-Governmental Committee was to\r\n\r\nbe  cancelled.  This will make no sense  unless  the\r\n\r\nletter  is  in  fact published.  As  for  the  other\r\n\r\npoints, you have agreed to them, although they  will\r\n\r\nnot be enshrined in the Constitution. I am happy  to\r\n\r\nleave it at that.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  is.  What about the rest of us? He is  happy  to\r\n\r\nleave  it  at what? At the fact that he has  written\r\n\r\nit,  that  there is no confirmation even by  letter,\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  not in the Constitution, and  that  it\r\n\r\ncannot be enforced in any court of law or otherwise!\r\n\r\nHe  is  happy to deal with the fate of Singapore  in\r\n\r\nthis  fashion.  \"I am happy to leave  it  at  that.\"\r\n\r\n- playing  marbles in a backlane! Sir,  this  is  the\r\n\r\nother aberration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, let us come to the main motion -\r\n\r\nthis  tragedy  which  they have transformed  into  a\r\n\r\nfarce. They ask the people of Singapore to adopt the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  provisions and amendments  contained\r\n\r\nin   Paper  Cmd.  22  of  1963  and  the  amendments\r\n\r\ncontained  in Cmd. 24. As the Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  a  few  moments ago. \"It is in  our  power  to\r\n\r\nrevise the British White Paper and we have the power\r\n\r\nto  adopt  or reject.\" Mr Speaker, let us  took  at\r\n\r\nwhat we are supposed to adopt. First of all, we  are\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  adopt  the  agreement  signed  by  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's  Government,  the  Federation  of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore. I say it is the\r\n\r\nheight of impertinence for us to adopt any of  these\r\n\r\nfour   instruments  indicated  in  this   particular\r\n\r\nDocument!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the Malaysia Bill. Of course, we\r\n\r\nare  interested in it, Mr Speaker.  It  is  curious\r\n\r\nthat we should be asked to adopt it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just after the Malaysia Bill, we come to the\r\n\r\nConstitution of the State of Sabah. It  is  we,  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of the Legislative Assembly, who adopt  the\r\n\r\nConstitution of the State of Sabah!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the next Document that we adopt, Mr Speaker\r\n\r\n- let us not forget\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  our  duty and our  responsibility - the\r\n\r\nConstitution of the State of Sarawak! Then  we  come\r\n\r\nto the Constitution of the State of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have to adopt the Immigration Bill for\r\n\r\nMalaysia!  We  have  to  adopt  the  application  to\r\n\r\nService lands in Singapore of the defence agreement!\r\n\r\nThey  have  not even had the courtesy to  table  the\r\n\r\nDefence Agreement. We are blind chickens. What  does\r\n\r\nit  matter - you pass the motion; you say that 8 p.m.\r\n\r\non Thursday there is a closure: we have our numbers;\r\n\r\nthere  are blind sheep all over the place; everybody\r\n\r\nhas  to vote; we know we are 25 to 25; we know  that\r\n\r\nthe  Alliance has to vote with us? So what  does  it\r\n\r\nmatter? All this is nonsense; all this is talk. Sir,\r\n\r\nI have a respect for this House. I table the Defence\r\n\r\nAgreement  so  that Members who are  interested  may\r\n\r\nknow what it is about - the Defence Agreement of 12th\r\n\r\nOctober,   1957,  between  Her  Britannic  Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of Defence Agreement handed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next Order that we have to adopt, Sir, is the\r\n\r\nform of Compensation Order in Council - North Borneo\r\n\r\nand  Sarawak!  Do not forget that we have  to  adopt\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing we have to adopt is the Form of\r\n\r\nPublic  Officers Agreements in respect of Sabah  and\r\n\r\nSarawak. Well done, we have to adopt that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, it is a curious position and a very\r\n\r\ncurious  change from the days only three months  ago\r\n\r\nwhen the Prime Minister said he refused to table  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  the Constitution of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia when the draft was received. He said,  \"Why\r\n\r\nshould  I table documents referring to North  Borneo\r\n\r\nwhen  it is not my responsibility?\" I see you  in  a\r\n\r\nquestioning  mood, Mr Speaker. In that  case  would\r\n\r\nyou  care to look at Hansard, Vol. 20, No.  2,  col. 43. Mr Speaker. I asked:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, perhaps it was an oversight that the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   has  omitted  to  indicate  whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will give this Assembly an opportunity to\r\n\r\ndebate  the whole Draft Constitution, including  the\r\n\r\nConstitution of Singapore in the context\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[not that we should adopt] of the Constitution for the Borneo territories...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Prime Minister: Indeed my reply, Sir,I  have\r\n\r\nalready on one famous occasion...',\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>and  he  goes  on  and on. But let us  come  to  the\r\n\r\nmaterial part - the last six lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That is not my problem. I am not charged with\r\n\r\nthese  responsibilities and I see no  reason  why  I\r\n\r\nshould  move their State amendments in this Assembly\r\n\r\nor allow it as a subject for debate, in which case I\r\n\r\nshall  have  to  defend or condemn it.  But  I  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  allow the fullest of debate on the  whole\r\n\r\nof  the  Malaysian Constitution and on the Singapore\r\n\r\nState   Constitution,  but  not  the   Constitutions\r\n\r\nconcerning Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  we  are asked to adopt. Sir, can we adopt?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, does it make any difference if we adopt, as\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. says? If we reject, as the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueens-town  says. If we amend, as  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park says. Has it got any validity? I say  to\r\n\r\nyou, Mr Speaker, the whole thing is a farce. Let us\r\n\r\nstart  with  the document which the  House  has  not\r\n\r\nseen. I have in my hand - I shall table it and it  is\r\n\r\nthe  only copy I have, Mr Speaker - the Malaysia Bill\r\n\r\nof  the  United  Kingdom which I  believe  has  been\r\n\r\npassed  without  amendment. It starts  off  with  an\r\n\r\nExplanatory Memorandum:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Bill provides for the relinquishment of Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's sovereignty and jurisdiction in respect of\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore (referred to  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  as \"the new States\") for the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nenabling  them to federate with the existing  States\r\n\r\nof the Federation of Malaya in accordance [I ask you\r\n\r\nto  remember this, Sir] with the Malaysia  Agreement\r\n\r\nCmd. 2094).'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Let us look at clause I (now section 1) of this Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) For the purpose of enabling North Borneo,\r\n\r\nSarawak  and Singapore (in this Act referred  to  as\r\n\r\n\"the  new  States\")  to federate with  the  existing\r\n\r\nStates  of  the Federation of Malaya  (in  this  Act\r\n\r\nreferred  to  as  \"the Federation\"), the  Federation\r\n\r\nthereafter  being called Malaysia,  on  the  day  on\r\n\r\nwhich the new States are federated as aforesaid  (in\r\n\r\nthis  Act  referred to as \"the appointed  day\")  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's sovereignty and jurisdiction in respect of\r\n\r\nthe  new States shall be relinquished so as to  vest\r\n\r\nin the manner agreed [operative words: in the manner\r\n\r\nagreed]  between the United Kingdom of Great Britain\r\n\r\nand  Northern Ireland, the Federation  and  the  new\r\n\r\nStates.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What  is  the  manner agreed? You see, Sir,  it  has\r\n\r\nalready been passed by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  of Commons and the House of Lords - I  repeat,\r\n\r\nit  has  already been passed and become an Act  - and\r\n\r\nthe  manner  agreed is the manner that  has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  agreed and it is already referred  to  in  the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Memorandum. I know that in this House it\r\n\r\ndoes  not matter two hoots. We see it every  day  at\r\n\r\nleast  two  dozen times, if not more, the Government\r\n\r\ndoing  a  \"Profumo\" on the House. But I should  very\r\n\r\nmuch  like to see - they really believe it - Mr Duncan\r\n\r\nSandys  trying  to do a \"Profumo\" on  the  House  by\r\n\r\ntrying  to  introduce an Order in Council  different\r\n\r\nfrom  that which has already been agreed put in  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia White Paper Cmd. 2094 and approved by  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in case there are hasty lawyers in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  there is a clause, now section 4 (3),  which\r\n\r\nlooks  as  though Her Majesty can vary an  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil  that has been approved already  under  this\r\n\r\nBill. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any Order in Council under subsection (1) of this\r\n\r\nsection  shall be subject to annulment in  pursuance\r\n\r\nof  a resolution of either House of Parliament,  and\r\n\r\nmay  be  varied or revoked by a subsequent Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Which is subsection (1)  of this section?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Her Majesty may by Order in Council make such\r\n\r\nadaptations  in any Act of Parliament passed  before\r\n\r\nthe  appointed  day as appear to  Her  necessary  or\r\n\r\nexpedient in consequence of the new States  becoming\r\n\r\nincluded in the Federation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us take it step by step. Section 1 which\r\n\r\nvests   the  sovereignty  in  accordance  with   the\r\n\r\nagreements  in  the manner agreed. Section  4  which\r\n\r\ndeals  with adaptations of Acts of Parliament  which\r\n\r\ncan  be  varied by Order in Council. But the vesting\r\n\r\nof  the sovereignty cannot be varied by an iota.  If\r\n\r\nit is so varied, Mr Speaker, it is null and void. I\r\n\r\nshould be more than surprised. Singapore lawyers can\r\n\r\ndo  what  they  please. They produce or  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment produces a White Paper that is a  forgery\r\n\r\nand  if  they  think  that  they  can  persuade  Her\r\n\r\nBritannic Majesty's Government to play the  game  of\r\n\r\npolitics  the way they do, they will find  they  are\r\n\r\nmistaken.  And we are here arguing about amendments,\r\n\r\nadoptions, rejections. This is law, Mr Speaker. You\r\n\r\ncannot say to the Judge, \"I reject your sentence  of\r\n\r\ndeath. I adopt your\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsentence.\"  What absurdity. The sentence is  passed.\r\n\r\nThere  is  the  Bill and there is the memorandum  of\r\n\r\nagreement. And it is the height of absurdity to deal\r\n\r\nwith  responsible  people and the  Assembly  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in such disgraceful fashion. After all,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I have read to you the Bill. Now  look  at\r\n\r\nthe clauses of the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill says in the manner agreed. This was\r\n\r\ntabled before they read it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article I:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Colonies of North Borneo and Sarawak and the\r\n\r\nState  of  Singapore  shall be  federated  with  the\r\n\r\nexisting States of the Federation of Malaya  as  the\r\n\r\nStates of Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore in accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the constitutional instruments annexed to this\r\n\r\nAgreement ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  they  shall be federated in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional instruments now annexed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article III:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Government of the United Kingdom will submit\r\n\r\nto  Her Britannic Majesty before Malaysia Day Orders\r\n\r\nin  Council for the purpose of giving the  force  of\r\n\r\nlaw  to  the  Constitutions of  Sabah,  Sarawak  and\r\n\r\nSingapore as States of Malaysia which are set out in\r\n\r\nAnnexes B, C and D to this Agreement.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>They are set out already in detail. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article IV:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... as from Malaysia Day, of Her Britannic\r\n\r\nMajesty's sovereignty and jurisdiction in respect of\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore so that the said\r\n\r\nsovereignty   and   jurisdiction   shall   on   such\r\n\r\nrelinquishment   vest   in  accordance   with   this\r\n\r\nAgreement and the constitutional instruments annexed\r\n\r\nto this Agreement.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely. Mr Speaker, is the Assembly of\r\n\r\nSingapore  purporting to amend an Act of the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  Parliament,  or  is  it  our  intention  to\r\n\r\nembarrass  the Secretary of State for  the  Colonies\r\n\r\nand  say,  \"Here,  we  have  got  the  vote  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Assembly. Now you give it to us.  If  not,\r\n\r\nthe  urchins  in the back alley can be a nuisance.\"?\r\n\r\nBut  do they really think that nuisance though  they\r\n\r\nmay  be,  embarrassing though they  may  be  to  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government, the British Government would  be\r\n\r\nconstitutionally  in a position, either  morally  or\r\n\r\nlegally, to accord this bankrupt Government that  is\r\n\r\nnow on the verge of resignation this? Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nmight add - no, let us leave it at that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject, Mr Speaker, much play has\r\n\r\nbeen made by this Government about the fact that  it\r\n\r\ndoes not resign now and if we want it to resign now,\r\n\r\nlet  us  all vote against this motion. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nyou  are  aware  that  there is  a  section  in  our\r\n\r\nConstitution which says that any government  elected\r\n\r\nunder  the  1958 Order in Council can  only  survive\r\n\r\nuntil  five  years  after the commencement  of  that\r\n\r\nOrder in Council in 1958, which means April 1964. So\r\n\r\nif  there  are  elections this month,  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nelected can only survive for seven months, that  is,\r\n\r\nuntil  March next year. Quite obviously, no  serious\r\n\r\nParty  wants  to insist on their resigning  now  and\r\n\r\nholding   elections  now,  and  that  is   why   the\r\n\r\nOpposition is being patient until 1st September,  so\r\n\r\nthat  from 1st September and in September they  have\r\n\r\nto resign. From the 1st September any elections held\r\n\r\nwill  be  held  under the new Constitution  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that comes to power will be a government\r\n\r\nfor  five  years.  So  this empty  bluff  about  \"We\r\n\r\nchallenge you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister knows well that this is a farce and he knew it well a long time ago. In fact, Mr Speaker, he promised us, solemnly promised us, that before he signed the agreement in England, we would be allowed to debate it and he would only sign it if it was approved by us. I do not ask you to take my word for it, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nAgain  I ask you to look at Volume 20, No. 2 of  our\r\n\r\nOfficial  Report, cols. 34, 35 and 42. May I  remind\r\n\r\nthe  House  of  this promise? Col. 34, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nabout ten lines from the bottom:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The present time-table is that all these\r\n\r\nconstitutional  amendments should be  ready  by  May\r\n\r\n[this  was only the 5th of April; three and  a  half\r\n\r\nmonths  ago]  or, at the latest, by  early  June  in\r\n\r\norder that they can be tabled before and approved by\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly and then incorporated in a treaty  to\r\n\r\nbe signed in London in June...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>You  see, Mr Speaker, \"the time-table... before and\r\n\r\napproved by this Assembly and then incorporated in a\r\n\r\ntreaty...\". Col. 35, in the middle column:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Members will realise the urgent necessity of our\r\n\r\nfinding   a  just  formula  for  working   out   our\r\n\r\ncontribution. If this is not done\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore the end of May, then the London treaty may be\r\n\r\ndelayed to the end of June or even the beginning  of\r\n\r\nJuly, since after agreement some time will be needed\r\n\r\nby  the  draftsmen to frame these amendments to  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Constitution and some further time will  be\r\n\r\ntaken by this Assembly to ... adopt them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is the second promise. Third promise is in col.\r\n\r\n42; in answer to my question, the last five lines of\r\n\r\nhis answer:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We hope that this vital question of finance can\r\n\r\nbe  resolved  soon in time for us to table  all  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional amendments for adoption by  May  [for\r\n\r\nadoption  by  May] in order that the treaty  can  be\r\n\r\nsigned in June.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>For adoption by us in May. One more falsehood nailed\r\n\r\nto  the  coffin. Only it gives me no  pleasure,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  He talks of integrity to this  House,  who\r\n\r\nhas  shown himself to be the most amoral person that\r\n\r\nI  have  ever met, and I doubt whether anybody  else\r\n\r\nhas ever met one quite so amoral as he is, with such\r\n\r\ncomplete contempt for truth, for word of honour, for\r\n\r\nhis  contractual  obligations, for his  undertaking,\r\n\r\nlet  alone for any respect for this House. Now,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  come  to those parts where  even  anger\r\n\r\npales.  I shall not deal with all aspects. When  you\r\n\r\nare  being crucified, Mr Speaker, you do not  worry\r\n\r\nwhether  somebody  is picking your  pocket  of  $150\r\n\r\nmillion  or $50 million. I shall not deal  with  the\r\n\r\n$150   million  or  $50  million  or  the  financial\r\n\r\ncontributions. These matters pale before two primary\r\n\r\nissues;  one,  that  the people  of  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nforever and all future generations be a people apart\r\n\r\nfrom other citizens of Malaysia and that they can be\r\n\r\neasily  discriminated against as and when it is  the\r\n\r\nwill of the Central Government; and the second part,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, is that our rice bowl which  has  been\r\n\r\nfilled  by a pattern of economy extending  over  140\r\n\r\nyears from the time of Raffles till today on a  free\r\n\r\nport  basis  is  going to be broken - not  in  twelve\r\n\r\nyears;  as  I see it in five with slow strangulation\r\n\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I shall first deal with citizenship. But\r\n\r\nI  think I would like at this stage  to  remind this House how \r\n\r\nbitterly I fought, I struggled and I  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagonised   for   a  common  citizenship   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation, because I say, and I am convinced it  is\r\n\r\nstill    true,   that   unless   we   have    common\r\n\r\nresponsibilities,  common  privileges,   we   cannot\r\n\r\nsurvive  for bug in this unequal harmony. I  do  not\r\n\r\nwant any privileges in education; I do not want  any\r\n\r\nprivileges in labour. We are twice as wealthy as the\r\n\r\nFederation.  I  do  not want to  keep  any  of  that\r\n\r\nwealth. I say let us make the great experiment, this\r\n\r\nunique   pioneer  experiment  in  mass  human   race\r\n\r\nrelations -as equal partners and mutual respect  and\r\n\r\nas  for  the free port of Singapore it is  for  your\r\n\r\ngood, nobody has ever doubted it for a moment.  That\r\n\r\nis  all that we sought, the same as Penang. And then\r\n\r\nwe  went to New York at our expense - at least myself\r\n\r\nat  mine, a large part - and thereafter there was  an\r\n\r\nexchange  of  letters,  and  everything  looked  all\r\n\r\nright.  Everybody  would have a common  citizenship.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be  common  disability  affecting   all\r\n\r\nStates,  and  there would be no discrimination.  And\r\n\r\nthere  were  even  P.A.P. radio forums  at  which  I\r\n\r\nagreed  to go and I agreed to be part of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda, because it seemed good to me and what is\r\n\r\ngood  for  the people, it does not matter  where  it\r\n\r\ncomes from. I went there and I asked questions and I\r\n\r\nreceived  thoroughly  dishonest  replies  that   we\r\n\r\nreceived  from  the  Prime Minister.  And  in  those\r\n\r\ncircumstances, I supported Command 33  of  1961  and\r\n\r\nbroke with my Party to do so. They said, \"Wait  till\r\n\r\nyou  see  the  final constitutional papers.  Do  not\r\n\r\ntrust  them.\" And I say, constitutionally you cannot\r\n\r\nproceed  on  the basis that your own  Government  is\r\n\r\nlying.  You  have got to proceed on the  basis  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  telling you the truth and only when  they\r\n\r\nlie  and  they have been proved to lie  when  events\r\n\r\nhave  proved the falsehood, only then should we turn\r\n\r\nagainst  them.  I  am in duty bound  to  accept  the\r\n\r\nassurances  given  by the Prime Minister.  Yes,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim was rather gentle with  me.  He\r\n\r\nused   the  word  \"bluff\";  others  might  use  even\r\n\r\nstronger  words. And now, Mr Speaker, we  have  the\r\n\r\nfull  round, back again to where we were,  where  we\r\n\r\nstarted.  Article 23. I am looking  at  the  English\r\n\r\none. I suspect so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch  our  local  one. Page 141. I am  afraid  I  am\r\n\r\ndealing with the mistake that I found there. I  have\r\n\r\ngot the notes not in respect of the citizenship.  If\r\n\r\nyou will be patient, Mr Speaker, I will be with you\r\n\r\nin  a minute. That is quite true, Sir,It is Article\r\n\r\n23  in the Federation Constitution at page 21 of the\r\n\r\nEnglish  one - Citizenship by operation of Law.  Now,\r\n\r\nyou  see,  Mr  Speaker,  they  give  us  what  they\r\n\r\npromised  to  give  us. Every citizen  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecomes  a  citizen of Malaysia - that is fine.  Then\r\n\r\nyou  go  to  the next page, 24 (4) : `Any certificate\r\n\r\nissued under Clause (1)  may state that the person to\r\n\r\nwhom  it  relates  is or is not a Singapore  citizen\r\n\r\n...'.  This  is  the  first reference  you  have  to\r\n\r\ncitizen  of  Malaysia chopped Singapore  citizen  or\r\n\r\ncitizen  of  Singapore - you know, the yellow  badge.\r\n\r\nNext  Article  28 (1)  - if the citizen  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwants  to  remove the yellow badge, Mr Speaker,  of\r\n\r\nbeing a citizen of Singapore and just wants to be  a\r\n\r\nFederation   citizen,  he  has  to  qualify   as   a\r\n\r\nforeigner. Next, Article 31. There, Mr Speaker,  we\r\n\r\nanticipated that we cannot stand for election in the\r\n\r\nFederation - that was clearly understood - or vote  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation and the Federation cannot vote or any\r\n\r\nof the Brunei States cannot vote in Singapore and we\r\n\r\ncannot  stand or vote for elections in  any  of  the\r\n\r\nBrunei  States  or in the Federation. We  understood\r\n\r\nthat,  but  we understood also something  else,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  as  I shall prove to you in a  moment.  We\r\n\r\nunderstood that that disability would be  common  to\r\n\r\nall  States. A Sarawak citizen would not be able  to\r\n\r\nvote  in  North  Borneo or in Singapore  or  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  and a Federation citizen would  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  vote in Sarawak or in North Borneo  and  a\r\n\r\nNorth  Borneo citizen would not be able to  vote  in\r\n\r\nSarawak or in the Federation. But let us look at the\r\n\r\nConstitution of Sabah. Section 16, page 86 - this  is\r\n\r\nidentical  with  section 16 of the  Constitution  of\r\n\r\nSarawak:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Every citizen [not, Sir, every citizen of North\r\n\r\nBorneo or Sabah, but every Malaysian citizen] of  or\r\n\r\nover  the age of 21 who is resident in the State  is\r\n\r\nqualified to be elected as an elected member...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  disqualification and the only  disqualification\r\n\r\nis  Article  31  of the Malaysia Constitution  which\r\n\r\ndisqualifies us from standing or voting for election\r\n\r\nin  any  State  outside  Singapore  or  any  citizen\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore coming to vote in Singapore.  But\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  Sabah Constitution  and  Sarawak\r\n\r\nConstitution, it means that the Senator who seems to\r\n\r\ndisplease  the P.A.P. so much and any other  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen  can  go  to  North  Borneo  and  stand  for\r\n\r\nelection  or  he  can go to Sarawak  and  stand  for\r\n\r\nelection  and  the Gentlemen from North  Borneo  can\r\n\r\nstand for election in the Federation or vote in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  as  normal citizens  do  with  just  the\r\n\r\nnormal  residence  qualification of  six  months  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  it  is. Singapore and only Singapore,  her\r\n\r\npeople and her descendants, are for ever isolated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, is there any serious prejudice\r\n\r\narising  out  of  the  fact of a  Malaysian  citizen\r\n\r\n(Singapore status)? What are the disadvantages?  Let\r\n\r\nus  look  at Article 60 - apart from the one  I  have\r\n\r\nalready   read.   Article   60   of   the   Malaysia\r\n\r\nConstitution   - this  in  the  hand   of   our   own\r\n\r\nGovernment, page 41:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In Article 9 of the Constitution, `in Clause (2)\r\n\r\n(which  guarantees  to citizens the  right  to  free movement  throughout the Federation), for the  words\r\n\r\n\"Subject  to  any restrictions imposed  by  any  law\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the security of the Federation\"  there\r\n\r\nshall  be  substituted the words \"Subject to  Clause\r\n\r\n(3)   and to any law relating to the security of  the\r\n\r\nFederation or any part thereof.\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Clause (3). That is a new clause, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`So long as under this Constitution any other\r\n\r\nState is in a special position as compared with  the\r\n\r\nStates  of  Malaya.  Parliament may  by  law  impose\r\n\r\nrestrictions,  as  between  that  State  and   other\r\n\r\nStates,  on  the rights conferred by Clause  (2)   in\r\n\r\nrespect of movement and residence:'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall show you in this very House on 6th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1961, the Prime Minister solemnly assuring\r\n\r\nme across the Floor of this House that we would have\r\n\r\nguarantees  of  freedom of movement,  guarantees  of\r\n\r\nassociation,  guarantees of  trade  union  movement,\r\n\r\nbeing able to have friendly and close relations with\r\n\r\nall other territories and branches. I shall show  it\r\n\r\nto you. I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe documents and the letters. And then it adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Provided no restriction on the right of movement\r\n\r\nbetween  the  State of Singapore and the  States  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  shall  be imposed by virtue of  this  Clause\r\n\r\nexcept by law relating to labour or education or  to\r\n\r\nany  matter  in  respect of which,  because  of  the\r\n\r\nspecial   position  of  Singapore,  it  appears   to\r\n\r\nParliament to be desirable to prevent the  enjoyment\r\n\r\nof  rights both in the State of Singapore and in the\r\n\r\nStates of Malaya.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Nice,  wide;  catch-all phrase.  In  the  Manual  of\r\n\r\nMilitary  Law,  you  have  \"conduct  unbecoming   an\r\n\r\nofficer\" if you cannot catch him for anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what are the disadvantages of having the\r\n\r\nyellow  badge  of Singapore, the chop  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nstatus? First, the voting. Right, we will leave that\r\n\r\nfor  the  moment. Next, restriction of movement  and\r\n\r\nresidence  in respect of all connected  with  labour\r\n\r\nand  education; the right to introduce  any  further\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  by  Parliament where  it  thinks  it\r\n\r\nappropriate. That is what it means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And last, Mr Speaker, the sting in the tail,\r\n\r\nright at the very bottom - the afterthought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Restrictions on the right to form associations\r\n\r\nconferred by paragraph (c)  of Clause (1)  may also be\r\n\r\nimposed by any law relating to labour or education.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So,  they  have  a  right to restrict  movement  and\r\n\r\nresidence between us and the Federation; they have a\r\n\r\nright  to  introduce new laws of discrimination  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  the  right  to introduce  laws  limiting\r\n\r\nfreedom of association. Do you want any more?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister promised us\r\n\r\nin  this  House  and the people what they  voted  on\r\n\r\nallegedly  in the referendum. I ask you to  look  at\r\n\r\nVolume  15  of our Official Report of 6th  December,\r\n\r\n1961, column 1396. This was a debate on merger,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker - myself  intervening   on   a   point   of\r\n\r\nelucidation which he was courteous enough to allow:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If it please you, Sir, this has been most helpful\r\n\r\nand   I   appreciate  your  consent.   The   Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution gives constitutional protection,  right\r\n\r\nof  residence,  right of work, right of  freedom  of\r\n\r\nassociation and freedom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   speech  in  the  Federation  - only  to  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens.  What does the Prime Minister really  mean\r\n\r\nwhen he says - I do not know whether he means what he\r\n\r\nsays - that a Singapore citizen who becomes a Federal\r\n\r\nnational will have all the constitutional rights  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation? It makes a lot of difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Prime Minister: Sir, that is so. If  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember had been following the Prime Minister of  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  he would, have noticed that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the Federation made the point that there\r\n\r\nwould   be  no  barrier  between  the  mingling   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  and  the  Federation  and  vice\r\n\r\nversa.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If   you  like  only  by  implication,  freedom   of\r\n\r\nmovement,   freedom  of  association,   freedom   of\r\n\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Speaker, the same debate, at column\r\n\r\n1399, midway:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Prime Minister: ... Sir, as to the second part of\r\n\r\nthe  amendment, E have already referred to paragraph\r\n\r\n14  of  Command  Paper  33  which  is  a  clear  and\r\n\r\ncategorical  statement  agreed  to  by   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the Federation of Malaya. It says that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nationals of the larger Federation, whether\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  or the  Federation  citizens,\r\n\r\nwill  as  nationals have equal rights,  carry  the\r\n\r\nsame  passport, enjoy the same protection  and  he\r\n\r\nsubject   to  equal  duties  and  responsibilities\r\n\r\nunder the Constitution of the larger Federation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  every  single word therein has  been  carefully\r\n\r\nweighed  by  the  Attorney-General  and  the   State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General on this side. The only point  where\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  are different  from  Federation\r\n\r\ncitizens is that Singapore citizens will continue to\r\n\r\nenjoy  their State rights and privileges - education,\r\n\r\nlabour,  social  welfare  benefits.  They   are   of\r\n\r\ndifferent rates, Sir.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, at column 1406. You see. I had been\r\n\r\npestering  him  if  you notice  earlier  and  so  he\r\n\r\nreplies in the second paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, in precise and clear terms, the White Paper\r\n\r\nexplains  that  no Singapore citizen will  lose  his\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights. In addition, he will acquire new\r\n\r\nrights as a national of the new Federation. I repeat\r\n\r\nthis again, because I think it bears repetition  for\r\n\r\nthe  purposes of the record. Among those rights will\r\n\r\nbe  the right to elect representatives direct to the\r\n\r\nFederation Parliament; the right to carry  the  same\r\n\r\npassport  and  enjoy the same rights and  privileges\r\n\r\nunder  the  Constitution;  and  to  be  subject,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, to the same duties and responsibilities  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  conscription,  taxes  and  so  on.  These\r\n\r\nrights  and  duties are set out in many sections  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Constitution, beginning with Article  8, ...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI congratulate him there, Sir. Then he goes on:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I do not want to labour the point, but I think\r\n\r\nhon. Members who are interested can look through the\r\n\r\ndocuments    entitled,    \"Malayan    Constitutional\r\n\r\nDocuments\".  They  can see there  spelt  out,  equal\r\n\r\nrights, equal liabilities of all citizens which will\r\n\r\nlater   on   be  of  all  nationals   of   the   new\r\n\r\nFederation.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is the Prime Minister. Mr Speaker, despite  my\r\n\r\nage  I  tend  to  be  excited by  things  that  seem\r\n\r\nworthwhile,  and I was so deeply impressed  by  this\r\n\r\nclarification.  I  wrote  a  letter  to  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  I  received  for  a  change  a   most\r\n\r\ncourteous   reply.  It  is  not  confidential,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.

If you would look at the Cobbold\r\n\r\nReport,  paragraph 190 (g), you will  find  it  says\r\n\r\nthere  conversely we can consider the  citizens  who\r\n\r\nare  normally  resident  in  either  of  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories should likewise be prevented from voting\r\n\r\nand  standing for election in any Federal  or  State\r\n\r\nelections outside their respective territories.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I did not have the Cobbold Report.\r\n\r\nI have  since tried to trace that paragraph.  Maybe  \r\n\r\nI have  been fobbed off with a false one. But I cannot \r\n\r\nfind paragraph 190 (g). Next:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Prime Minister, since you speak of the\r\n\r\nadvantages   of  Singapore  citizenship,   can   you\r\n\r\nindicate, apart from the common disability which  is\r\n\r\napplicable   to  all  territories,  is   there   any\r\n\r\ndisadvantage either potential or real,  attached  to\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship? - No. None that has  not  been\r\n\r\nmade  known.  I mean the citizenship  terms  are  as\r\n\r\nspelt  out  in  paragraph 14 of the White  Paper  as\r\n\r\namended  by  this agreement. If I may refer  to  the\r\n\r\nletter  of the Tunku in reply to mine, placing  this\r\n\r\nagreement on the record. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I confirm that the arrangement for citizenship of\r\n\r\nthe  inhabitants of Singapore will be  in  the  form\r\n\r\nagreed between the Governments of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya and Singapore as set out in paragraph  14  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  White Paper, Cmd. 33 of 1961, as  amended\r\n\r\nin regard to the nomenclature and franchise in terms\r\n\r\nof the statement referred to.\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sets out comprehensively what they are.\r\n\r\nMyself:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to ask in this context, is there any\r\n\r\nmaterial aspect affecting Citizenship either of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  or  of  Singapore which  is  being  kept\r\n\r\nsecret?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was still suspicious, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Answer:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`None whatsoever. I would be in an extremely\r\n\r\ndangerous position to keep such an important subject\r\n\r\nsecret.

Gangsters and\r\n\r\nsubversives  is important because some  people  will\r\n\r\ncome under either one of the two categories and they\r\n\r\nmay  be  asked, you know, to either stay on  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation side in a particular state or village, or\r\n\r\nstay  on  the Singapore side in a particular village\r\n\r\nor kampong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself: Will the Singapore citizens have the same\r\n\r\nrights  as  those from Sarawak and North  Borneo  to\r\n\r\nwork  and  have  their  business  in  Malaya  to  be\r\n\r\nemployed in the Malayan civil service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister: Malayan civil service - there will\r\n\r\nbe no Malayan civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself: Thank you - my mistake.

He assured us that there  would\r\n\r\nbe  freedom of association; he assured us that there\r\n\r\nwould be freedom of movement of labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the importance? Perhaps I might pause here\r\n\r\nand say this, Mr Speaker. As I see it, if there are\r\n\r\ndisadvantages to be borne, the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  share  the same disadvantages  as  everybody\r\n\r\nelse.  And  if  because of our special position,  we\r\n\r\nhave  got to carry a special disadvantage,  such  as\r\n\r\nhaving the British military bases here and being the\r\n\r\nflash-point  in time of war, to the  danger  of  the\r\n\r\nentirety  of our people - then we have to carry  that\r\n\r\nburden if it is for the good of Malaysia as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis  is  our  nation and if the general population,\r\n\r\nthrough   their  representatives,  think  that   the\r\n\r\nBritish  bases  are necessary for their  protection,\r\n\r\nthen  I say we must have it even if it endangers  us\r\n\r\nspecifically.  But there should  be  no  racial,  no\r\n\r\ncitizenship  discrimination and  distinction,  which\r\n\r\nwould  then not make us one people, but make us  two\r\n\r\ndistinct peoples as in fact is provided for in  this\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not sought to weary you, Mr Speaker. I am\r\n\r\nconscious,   first  of  all,   that   there   is   a\r\n\r\n\"guillotine\". I do not intend to hog the whole  time\r\n\r\nand  I  know that these technicalities can sometimes\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nboring.  But  throughout the Malaysian  Constitution\r\n\r\nthey speak of citizens in two ways - citizens outside\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens in Singapore  State;  there  are\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens and citizens outside  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo  there  are  two types of citizens  that  go  all\r\n\r\nalong. For example, residence inside Singapore  does\r\n\r\nnot  count  as  residence  for  citizenship  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation except Federation (Singapore State) - that\r\n\r\nis,  citizenship inside Singapore, residence  inside\r\n\r\nMalaysia, outside Singapore. You have got  this  all\r\n\r\nalong  and this is the one thing I have been  urging\r\n\r\nshould  not happen. We should not seek to  push  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore into a corner where they  find\r\n\r\nthemselves   discriminated,  separately  identified,\r\n\r\n\"alien\".  It is dangerous for the Malaysian  concept\r\n\r\n- not merely for us, Mr Speaker. It is dangerous for\r\n\r\nthe stability of Malaysia as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now. Mr Speaker, the next one I would like to\r\n\r\nrefer  again  to Volume 20 of our Official'  Report,\r\n\r\nNo. 2 of the 5th of April, 1963, where for the first\r\n\r\ntime, Mr Speaker, we get a curious note. Column  28\r\n\r\n-   this  is  the  Prime  Minister  speaking  in   a\r\n\r\nMinisterial Statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, I have dwelt in some detail on\r\n\r\nthis  question  of citizenship as I  am  quite  sure\r\n\r\nMembers of this House and the people outside will be\r\n\r\nhappy  to know that all their rights as citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and later as citizens of Malaysia will  be\r\n\r\nduly protected in the Constitution.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All our rights will be protected. He did not say a\r\n\r\nword  about  limitation of the right of association,\r\n\r\nabout  the right of Parliament to pass any  laws  to\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  against us. But he did  mention  in  a\r\n\r\ncurious  P.A.P. indirect  fashion  something  about\r\n\r\nLabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at column 31, Mr Speaker, the second\r\n\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Article 9 (1) , [of the Federation Constitution]\r\n\r\nwhich  prohibits  banishment of any  citizen,  shall\r\n\r\napply  in Singapore. The same applies to freedom  of\r\n\r\nmovement  under  Article  9  (2) ;  but  subject,  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  Singapore,  to  the  proviso  that  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government  may,  if  it  so  desires,   by\r\n\r\nlegislation  in  respect of labour or  education  or\r\n\r\nother  matters  in  which Singapore  citizens  enjoy\r\n\r\nautonomy,  prevent  the  double  enjoyment  of  both\r\n\r\nrights of State autonomy in Singapore and again full\r\n\r\nenjoyment of equal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrights  with other Malaysian citizens in respect  of\r\n\r\nlabour and education, again the other States.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  that  is not what the Constitution  says  about\r\n\r\nhaving double rights. Let us look, in fact, at  what\r\n\r\nhe  says  in answer to my question, Sir, if I  might\r\n\r\nread  my  question, because I was very disturbed  by\r\n\r\nthis  remark about limitation in respect  of  labour\r\n\r\nand education. Col. 36:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, Sir, the first question I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask is to seek clarification of the remark  that\r\n\r\n\"Singapore citizens are not to have double enjoyment\r\n\r\nof education and labour conditions in other States.\"\r\n\r\nDoes  it  by any means infer that Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nresident  in  other territories would be  unable  to\r\n\r\nfind  educational facilities for their  children  in\r\n\r\nschools  of  those States? Is there  any  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  citizens would be  unable  to  find\r\n\r\nemployment  in  other  States?  It  is  a   somewhat\r\n\r\nambiguous    phrase    and   I   would    appreciate\r\n\r\nclarification.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer - if I might read right to the end of that\r\n\r\nparagraph  of the Prime Minister's. Mr  Speaker.  I\r\n\r\nwill  be happy to read the whole if you think it  is\r\n\r\nfairer. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Column 37:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... if, as a result of a massive inflow from the\r\n\r\nFederation, it may not be possible for us to pay for\r\n\r\nnot  only  education hut lots of  other  items  like\r\n\r\nhousing  and other social benefits; then, of course,\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government would also consider itself\r\n\r\nnot  obliged  to  extend  these  facilities  to  our\r\n\r\ncitizens  as  of  grace  and they  will  perhaps  be\r\n\r\ncharged for their school fees there, as we may  well\r\n\r\ncharge Federal citizens for their school fees here.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are talking about movement of\r\n\r\nlabour and movement of education, and here he  says, oh  well, \r\n\r\nif  we limit the question of free  school fees, then they can limit theirs.\r\n\r\nIt looks as though all is for our bonny blue eyes! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am a little persistent, as\r\n\r\nUnfortunately you may have found -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr David Marshall: Mr Speaker, it is very important.\r\n\r\nWhat  about the question of workers - no question  of\r\n\r\ngrace  - apart from Government employment?  Will  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of Singapore be able as heretofore  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  the  Federation freely? Will they be  able  to\r\n\r\nobtain  private  employment without  limitation  and\r\n\r\nvice versa in so far as the Federation is concerned?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Prime Minister: That is so, Mr Speaker,  Sir.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  intention whatsoever to prohibit  the\r\n\r\nflow of labour one way or the other. But the proviso\r\n\r\nis included because we want to make provision for  a\r\n\r\nsituation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  which  we  may well have to refuse  to  shoulder\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  which may be more  than  what  our\r\n\r\nState finances can hear should the flow turn into  a\r\n\r\nflood.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that what the Constitution has, Mr Speaker?\r\n\r\n- there will be freedom of movement of labour?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this and I trust you will forgive me if for\r\n\r\na  few moments I draw attention to the future. There\r\n\r\nis a Chinese proverb. It says if you push a tiger to\r\n\r\nthe wall, he must turn. It is not wise, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nto  push  the  people of Singapore  into  isolation.\r\n\r\nThese matters are now part of the Constitution and I\r\n\r\nam  here  before you not to indulge in the farce  of\r\n\r\nadopting or rejecting, but of pleading that  in  the\r\n\r\nyears to come, this antagonism of the Federation  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  -  no doubt largely sparked  off  by  the\r\n\r\ndistaste  for the P.A.P. personalities - will  soften\r\n\r\nand  they  will  recognise the  importance  of  real\r\n\r\nintegration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, never in the history of humanity has there been an opportunity like this one, where vast masses of radically different races - and I say radically different ethnic groups because it is not merely a question of a Belgian and a German who are basically the same ethnic group, but it is the question of the Mongolian race, the proto-Malays,\r\n\r\nthe  Dravidians massively divided ethnic groups - for\r\n\r\nthe  first  time  in the history of humanity  coming\r\n\r\ntogether for the purposes of integrated co-operation\r\n\r\nin  building up common loyalties, a common  destiny,\r\n\r\nwhich  can  only  be done in the reality  of  inter-racial  respect and harmony. It is a  phrase  and  a\r\n\r\nprinciple, which is recognised by  millions,  which\r\n\r\nhas been propagated from a thousand pulpits, but  it\r\n\r\nhas  never  really been put into effect, never,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, in such a massive form as we will  have  to\r\n\r\ntry and put it. For our own sake and for the sake of\r\n\r\nhumanity,   I   say  this,  Mr   Speaker,   in   no\r\n\r\nchauvinistic  spirit: that this is a pioneer  effort\r\n\r\nin  the  service of humanity, that we should succeed\r\n\r\nin  making it workable for radically distinct ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups  to integrate. We have reached the  stage  in\r\n\r\nhuman  development that if such an  experiment  does\r\n\r\nnot  succeed,  there  is very little  hope  for  the\r\n\r\nsurvival of humanity as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge that when calm reigns again and the\r\n\r\nirritant of the presence of the evil spirit  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. no longer dominates the scene, and I mean  in\r\n\r\nthe  near future, Mr Speaker, there should be  very\r\n\r\nserious  review of these provisions. The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   are   a   decent,   peaceable,   and   a\r\n\r\ntremendously valuable people. It would be a  tragedy\r\n\r\nto us, primarily to the Federation and to the world,\r\n\r\nif  we  should be driven into a position  which  can\r\n\r\nengender  only bitterness, frustration and the  itch\r\n\r\nto  retaliation, for it is on those sentiments  that\r\n\r\nCommunism  thrives, and it is measures of  isolation\r\n\r\nof our people that would encourage Communist growth.\r\n\r\nWhen  you  have no hope left, Mr Speaker, and  your\r\n\r\nback  is to the wall. You cannot blame human  beings\r\n\r\nfor   grabbing  foolishly  at  passing   expedients,\r\n\r\nbecause  they  have  not the  time  to  wait  for  a\r\n\r\ngeneration   or  two  generations   to   see   these\r\n\r\ninequalities dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, I turn to another aspect. First,\r\n\r\nour  citizenship cheapened, and now  our  rice  bowl\r\n\r\ndestroyed. I want to speak about the Customs  Union,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, a subject on which there seems to be  a\r\n\r\ncertain  shyness to tell the truth. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park says, \"I am not in a position  to  talk\r\n\r\nabout  a Customs Union and the free port status.\"  I\r\n\r\nam  a  little disappointed because I would say  with\r\n\r\nrespect,  that with the facts before him and  if  he\r\n\r\nhad  read  the Rueff Report he, as well  as  others,\r\n\r\nshould be in a position to express views which could\r\n\r\nbe of assistance to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, before I start, I want to read two curious documents. The first is by the Prime Minister of Singapore, not last century, not four years ago, not last year, but last month. I quote from a copy of our Official Report which you have not even had the time to print being Vol. 20, No. 6. The date is 10th of June, last month. It seems ages\r\n\r\nago. Last month - a solemn promise that they will not\r\n\r\nseek  a Customs Union, and today a Customs Union  it\r\n\r\nis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Mr Speaker. I asked a question on a\r\n\r\nMinisterial Statement at page 8 [col. 621]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Mr Speaker, I would inquire from the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   whether  he  does  not  think   it   more\r\n\r\nappropriate that we should have a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper? Would he consider publishing  a  White\r\n\r\nPaper  together  with the memoranda referred  to  by\r\n\r\nhim,  and  particularly, Sir, in view  of  the  very\r\n\r\ngrave connotations to that statement of his, that  a\r\n\r\ncommon  market  has been agreed upon,  which  rather\r\n\r\nsuggests  not  a common market, Sir, but  a  Customs\r\n\r\nUnion  [it  is curious that I should have  had  that\r\n\r\nsuspicion  in my bones]; and whether he  would  also\r\n\r\npublish  the  Rueff Report for which  we  have  been\r\n\r\nanxiously  awaiting,  so that  we  should  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition with some responsibility and seriousness to\r\n\r\nconsider  a matter gravely affecting our future.  It\r\n\r\nshould  not be taken so hurriedly, Sir.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter for study and I would urge the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nto  indicate  whether he would consider  the  urgent\r\n\r\npublication of a White Paper with the memoranda  and\r\n\r\nthe  details  he has given, and other  details  that\r\n\r\nmight help us, together with the Rueff Report.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Page 9 [col. 622] - Mr Speaker, I would like you  to\r\n\r\nfollow  me in case I stopped for a moment  and  left\r\n\r\nit. One-third of the way down:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I say the House can have my assurance that we\r\n\r\nwill not move, and in fact we have no right to move,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  terms of the White Paper which  had  been\r\n\r\nvoted upon by the people [of Singapore] unless there\r\n\r\nis  definitely  a  quid pro quo.  ...  The  detailed\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Common Market  are  contained\r\n\r\nin the Rueff Report. It will have to be gone through\r\n\r\nby  the  officials. But I can assure the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  that  nothing  would give  me  more  pleasure\r\n\r\neventually  when negotiations have been successfully\r\n\r\nconcluded than to publish them in toto and  I  think\r\n\r\nhe, and even more so the merchants who have built  a\r\n\r\nvaluable and lucrative trade over the years  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  our free port, will have a great interest\r\n\r\nin seeing that all this does not disappear...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Please notice this, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... and even more so the merchants who have built a\r\n\r\nvaluable and lucrative trade over the years  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  our free port, will have a great interest\r\n\r\nin  seeing that all this does not disappear  in  the\r\n\r\nchase  of a will-o'-the-wisp for a common market.  I\r\n\r\nthink  he can take the assurance of my Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, who has met these merchants, that there  is\r\n\r\nno such sudden disappearance of our free port at all\r\n\r\nunder contemplation.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So we will not chase the will-o'-the-wisp. We do not\r\n\r\nintend to have a Customs Union. This is genuinely  a\r\n\r\nfree port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, one other curious document because the\r\n\r\nSingapore Chamber of Commerce, which is not the Singapore  Chamber  \r\n\r\nof  Commerce  but  the  European Chamber  of Commerce, has come out \r\n\r\nwith a  statement supporting  the P.A.P. and saying what  a  wonderful idea this \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCustoms  Union  is.  Have you  to  hand,  Sir,  this\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly Paper No. 9 of 1962? If I might\r\n\r\nrefer  to pages C3 and C4. This Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nPaper  No.  9  of  1962 is a Report  of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  the  Tariff Advisory  Commission  and\r\n\r\nCustoms  (Amendment) Bills. Representation was  made\r\n\r\nto this Committee by the Joint Standing Committee of\r\n\r\nthe   Chambers   of  Commerce  of   Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nrepresentation is dated the 5th June, 1962, one year\r\n\r\nago. Mr Speaker:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Chambers of Commerce of Singapore have been\r\n\r\non record on a number of occasions expressing a very\r\n\r\nstrong  view that protective duties of any kind  are\r\n\r\nin  general undesirable and they would be  reluctant\r\n\r\nto  readily  accept the new Ordinance which  goes  a\r\n\r\nlong  way  to make permanent the existing  machinery\r\n\r\nhitherto  established for the purpose of considering\r\n\r\nand  promulgating duties on imported goods  when  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  place  they had been unhappy  about  the\r\n\r\noriginal law on the subject.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  the second paragraph of the representation\r\n\r\nof  the Joint Chambers of Commerce of Singapore. The\r\n\r\nthird paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Chambers of Commerce have always been deeply\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  any  proposals  which  may  have  a\r\n\r\ndamaging effect on the free port status of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the entrepot trade on which the State is  to  a\r\n\r\ngreat extent dependent. The need to industrialise is\r\n\r\nclearly  understood by the Chambers, but  they  have\r\n\r\nalways  held  the view that any question  of  duties\r\n\r\nshould be considered as and when the need arises...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is  from  the  Singapore  Joint  Chambers   of\r\n\r\nCommerce  in June 1962. And, Sir, the Memorandum  of\r\n\r\nHeads  of Agreement in respect of which we  had  the\r\n\r\nmerger referendum. Article 17 has been read to  you,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker. I want you to reiterate  that  it  was\r\n\r\nthere  enshrined that this Constitution was  subject\r\n\r\nto  the  maintenance  of the  free  port  status  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and that the Constitution  would  not  be\r\n\r\nchanged  except  with the concurrence  of  both  the\r\n\r\nSingapore and Federal Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us look at Cmd. 22 of 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Article IX:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The provisions of Annex J to this Agreement\r\n\r\nrelating to Common Market and financial arrangements\r\n\r\nshall constitute an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgreement  between the Government of the  Federation\r\n\r\nof Malaya and the Government of Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not written on the back of an envelope. It is\r\n\r\nformally  embodied as part of the Constitution.  And\r\n\r\nwhat  is  this document, Annex J? Our copy does  not\r\n\r\neven have an index but you will find it at page 226.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, there are two kinds of duties\r\n\r\nenvisaged  in Annex J. One is called the  protective\r\n\r\nduty,  that  is  to say, a duty on industrial  goods\r\n\r\nintended  for the purpose of encouraging  industries\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia and not for revenue. If you are  aware,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  we have in Singapore  two  protective\r\n\r\nduties,   soap   and   paints.  Because   they   are\r\n\r\nmanufactured  in  Singapore and so to  protect  them\r\n\r\nagainst  competition by countries which have  better\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  abilities  and  wider   markets   and\r\n\r\ntherefore  able to produce more cheaply,  we  put  a\r\n\r\nduty  on soap and paints coming in, in order to help\r\n\r\nour industries to grow and stabilise themselves. But\r\n\r\nI  would  like you to notice, Mr Speaker,  that  in\r\n\r\nAnnex  J,  and  when you read the Rueff  Report  the\r\n\r\nemphasis  is  on  the  greater  prosperity  to   the\r\n\r\nFederation   of  Malaya,  not  Malaysia,   but   the\r\n\r\nFederation   Government,   by   the   extension   of\r\n\r\nprotective duties because they would have a  50  per\r\n\r\ncent increased market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are wealthier than the Federation in per capita\r\n\r\nincome,  and  consequently our purchasing  power  is\r\n\r\ngreater.  So the provisions are not merely  for  the\r\n\r\nprotection  of  Singapore industries,  but  for  the\r\n\r\nprotection  also of Federation industries.  That  is\r\n\r\nfair  enough, Sir, if it works out equitably because\r\n\r\nthe  prosperity  of the Federation is  naturally  to\r\n\r\nsome  extent,  I hope, ours. The question  is:  what\r\n\r\nassurances  have  we that, in fact,  our  industries\r\n\r\nwill be enabled to establish themselves? There is  a\r\n\r\nprovision to which your attention has been drawn  in\r\n\r\nArticle  1  (3), that the Federation  can  introduce\r\n\r\nduties  in  respect  of Singapore produced  products\r\n\r\nbecause Singapore at the present moment and for five\r\n\r\nyears to come will not be subject to revenue duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the second thing I want to point out, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, is that for these five\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears Singapore shall not resist the introduction of\r\n\r\nrevenue  duties  except if it is necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nprotection  of  her entrepot trade.  If  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary for her entrepot trade, then we  shall  be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  the same customs duties  for  revenue\r\n\r\npurposes as the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third thing I want you to notice, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nis  that for the first five years, if any duty  that\r\n\r\nthe  Federation introduces we consider is not merely\r\n\r\nfor  our  benefit, but would endanger  our  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade,  then we may ask for 12 months' grace and  no\r\n\r\nmore. It is fair enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, we come to Article 4 (4) of Annex J.\r\n\r\nThere,   contrary   to  the  specific   and   urgent\r\n\r\nrecommendation  of  the  Rueff  Report,  the  Tariff\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Board  is given authority to  review,  not\r\n\r\nprotective duties, but revenue duties. I shall  show\r\n\r\nyou  in  the Rueff Report that they urged  that  the\r\n\r\nTariff Advisory Board should have nothing to do with\r\n\r\nrevenue duties. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Before 31st December, 1968, the Tariff Advisory\r\n\r\nBoard  shall review the revenue duties in  force  at\r\n\r\nthat  time  in  Singapore and in  the  remainder  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  shall make recommendations  regarding\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  of such duties or the imposition  of\r\n\r\nadditional  duties. As from 1st January,  1969,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government shall be entitled to  withhold\r\n\r\nits  consent to the imposition of revenue  ... duty\r\n\r\n[only if we pay ransom money]'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under the White Paper we pay already $135\r\n\r\nmillion,  40 per cent of which, we are told  in  the\r\n\r\ncorrespondence  and published documents,  is  really\r\n\r\nfar in excess of what the Government is entitled  to\r\n\r\nunder  the  White  Paper Command  33  of  1961.  But\r\n\r\ncertainly  nowhere  in  the  White  Paper   is   the\r\n\r\nFederation   Government   entitled   to   additional\r\n\r\nrevenue,  because  we  think  the  introduction   of\r\n\r\nrevenue duties would destroy our entrepot trade. And\r\n\r\nafter 1968, five years from hence, if the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment says, as it says, Sir, in Article 4 (1) :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In formulating its policy relating to the\r\n\r\nharmonisation   of  revenue  duties,   the   Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment   shall   pay   due   regard    to    any\r\n\r\nrepresentations made...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if after 1968, they, say, want to impose a\r\n\r\nduty  on  sugar because there is a duty on sugar  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  have  a very large export market in sugar,  then\r\n\r\nassuming   that  the  duty  on  sugar  consumed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would yield $50 million, we have  to  pay\r\n\r\nthe  Federation 40 per cent of the revenue we do not\r\n\r\nearn in order to buy off the imposition of that duty\r\n\r\nevery  year. This we have to do, Mr Speaker,  in  a\r\n\r\nconsistently  running-down economy,  loans  of  $150\r\n\r\nmillion  already  made  from  our  exchequer:   $135\r\n\r\nmillion or more annually made to the Federation; our\r\n\r\ncost  of  living  going  up  as  a  result  of   the\r\n\r\nimposition of duties; our harbour facilities running\r\n\r\ndown  because our free port status is being  eroded.\r\n\r\nWe have to pay these additional sums of money by way\r\n\r\nof ransom to maintain our survival. But this is only\r\n\r\nfor a period of seven years. There is no grace after\r\n\r\n1975. After 1975 there will be one common tariff for\r\n\r\nboth protective duties and revenue duties throughout\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  The greatest port in Asia - Singapore  - 70\r\n\r\nmillion  tons of shipping, 2 million tons  of  cargo\r\n\r\nannually,   the   second  greatest   port   in   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth, the fifth greatest port in  the  whole\r\n\r\nworld,  for 140 years of development of this concept\r\n\r\nof  free  trade,  free port, we have  grown  and  we\r\n\r\nsupport  our population. The Government has reminded\r\n\r\nus  often enough when jeering at the Barisan that we\r\n\r\nhave no assets under the earth, no tin, no gold,  we\r\n\r\nhave  no agriculture to speak of, we have no fishery\r\n\r\nto  speak of. Our basic source of employment is  our\r\n\r\nport.  Mr  Speaker, until the Member for  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nspoke.  I  was not aware that there is  anywhere  in\r\n\r\nhistory any legend or incident to indicate that  the\r\n\r\nleading  citizen of any State sold the pass  to  his\r\n\r\nown State and destroyed his own people. And this  is\r\n\r\nthe  work,  Mr  Speaker, of two  people,  hence  my\r\n\r\nmotion  -  the  Prime Minister and the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  -  because I shall prove to you that  until\r\n\r\nthey left for London on the 25th of June, there  was\r\n\r\nnot  a  word,  there was nothing  about  the  common\r\n\r\nmarket.

I\r\n\r\ntalk of a Customs Union, and he says I mean a Common\r\n\r\nMarket. He already said. Mr Speaker, and I read  to\r\n\r\nyou  the  speech of the Prime Minister. \"We have  no\r\n\r\nintention  of  chasing  the  will-o'-the-wisp,   and\r\n\r\ndestroying our present position of a free  port.\"  I\r\n\r\nam  not  talking of a Common Market. We are  all  in\r\n\r\nagreement with the concept of a Common Market, which\r\n\r\nmeans, in the context of Singapore as a free port, a\r\n\r\ncertain erosion of the principles of a free port for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of protective duties, which is  clearly\r\n\r\nenunciated.  They understand what  I  mean.  Revenue\r\n\r\nduties  have nothing to do with a Common  Market  as\r\n\r\nconceived for Singapore and never had, and since  he\r\n\r\nrefers  to his Five-Year Plan, let me refer to  some\r\n\r\nof his own utterances. I have already shown you that\r\n\r\ndespite  their  Five-Year Plan where they  say  they\r\n\r\nwant  to destroy -the free port, they did in Article\r\n\r\n17  of Command 33 of 1961 say, \"The free port status\r\n\r\nof Singapore will be enshrined in the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nNow  let us look at the speech of His Excellency the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara on the 31st of October, 1961,\r\n\r\nat  Volume 15. Column 10. That is a speech,  as  you\r\n\r\nwill   appreciate.  Mr  Speaker,  written  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and those aspects dealing with  finance\r\n\r\nwritten  by  the Finance Minister. This  is  talking\r\n\r\nabout the merger:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Merchants want a merger under conditions under\r\n\r\nwhich  our free port status and our free trade  with\r\n\r\nall  countries  will continue, and under  which  our\r\n\r\ntrading  links with the whole world will  remain  as\r\n\r\nthey have been free and easy.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat  is  31st October, 1961 - \"under which our  free\r\n\r\nport  status  and our free trade with all  countries\r\n\r\nwill  continue\". You will appreciate therefore  that\r\n\r\non the merger debate, nobody was disturbed about the\r\n\r\nfree  port  status of Singapore. We had it enshrined\r\n\r\nin Article 17 of the White Paper. We had it from the\r\n\r\nmouth of His Excellency in the inaugural speech, and\r\n\r\nI  was the only one who made passing reference to it\r\n\r\nat  column 571 of Volume 15, No. 7 of 23rd November,\r\n\r\n1961:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The fifth reason given by the Government in His\r\n\r\nExcellency's policy speech is that the merchants  of\r\n\r\nSingapore want a continuance of our free port status\r\n\r\nand  maintenance of our trade with the whole  world.\r\n\r\nSir,  it is almost unbelievable. I refuse to believe\r\n\r\nthat this Government is not aware that there is such\r\n\r\na  State as the State of Penang. I refuse to believe\r\n\r\nthat  this Government is not aware that Penang is  a\r\n\r\nfree  port  by  virtue  of  a  small  part  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Customs Ordinance. I refuse  to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  this Government is not conscious of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  free  port status of Singapore  could  be\r\n\r\nfully protected under complete merger. So how is  it\r\n\r\nthat   they  have  the  audacity  to  say,  in   His\r\n\r\nExcellency's  speech,  that  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nmerchants  who want a continuance of our  free  port\r\n\r\nstatus and maintenance of our trade relations cannot\r\n\r\nbe protected under a complete merger?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  was  the only reference, Mr Speaker,  in  all\r\n\r\nthose  agonising speeches on His Excellency's speech\r\n\r\nand on the merger, about free port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we leave merger and we come to the Annual\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement. The Annual Budget Statement  made\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister for Finance to this House  on  the\r\n\r\n20th  November, 1961, at Volume 15,  No.  10,  dated\r\n\r\n28th November, 1961, column 815, paragraph 3:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We in Singapore live in a tight economic\r\n\r\nsituation.  We  are a small island  State  which  is\r\n\r\nprosperous   because  of  our  central  geographical\r\n\r\nposition. This allows us to render services of value\r\n\r\nto  our  neighbours. Through the port  of  Singapore\r\n\r\npasses  much  of  the produce of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, Indonesia and Borneo. In addition, we  serve\r\n\r\nas  a supply base for the consumer goods which these\r\n\r\nterritories  need. This is the main  source  of  our\r\n\r\nlivelihood. We will continue to earn this livelihood\r\n\r\nso long as we provide these services efficiently and\r\n\r\nso long as we are on good terms with our neighbours.\r\n\r\nBut  when neither of these things obtains, then this\r\n\r\nprincipal source of our livelihood may shrivel.

Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, on this point I want to say something which\r\n\r\nwas    twice   repeated   in   the   Rueff   Report.\r\n\r\nIndustrialisation  as  a  balanced  aspect  of   the\r\n\r\neconomy of a State is valuable. Industrialisation as\r\n\r\nthe sum total of a State activity is pernicious.  It\r\n\r\nhas  tremendous social evils. Now, let me read [col.\r\n\r\n557]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`First what can Singapore hope to do by way of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation?  A  large  nation  with   a   big\r\n\r\npopulation  and  an extensive land  area  with  many\r\n\r\nnatural resources can afford to experiment with high\r\n\r\ncost  industries  set  up  under  a  prohibition  of\r\n\r\nimports  or  a high tariff wall. Such a country  can\r\n\r\nallow these high cost industries to survive even  if\r\n\r\nthe  industries  are  not  efficient  in  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance,  by passing on the increased cost  to  the\r\n\r\nconsumer.  Industrialisation on these lines  can  be\r\n\r\nrapid and spectacular if it is pressed forward  with\r\n\r\nsufficient energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, however, lacks the pre-requisites for\r\n\r\nsuch  an  endeavour,  namely,  a  large  population,\r\n\r\nvaried  natural resources and extensive  land  area.\r\n\r\nThis   being   the  case,  our  plan  of  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion  must  be more circumspect and  judicious.\r\n\r\nParticularly as our economy still rests so  much  on\r\n\r\ntrade, enforced industrialisation at the expense  of\r\n\r\ntrade  can be an uncertain gamble with such a  small\r\n\r\ndomestic market as we have.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Are  we  going  to be told, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nenforced  industrialisation at the expense of  trade\r\n\r\nis  now  a  certain gamble because we have increased\r\n\r\nour   domestic  market?  Not  by  five   times   the\r\n\r\npopulation.  That  is not what is  relevant  but  by\r\n\r\ntwice the purchasing power of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Four times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is what we are going to be\r\n\r\ntold. Now, Sir, I go on to column 562, last sentence\r\n\r\non Common Market:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As I have stated before this House on previous\r\n\r\noccasions,  there would be no difficulty  whatsoever\r\n\r\nin  getting  agreement on a common market  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya if we were prepared  to  join\r\n\r\nthem  in a full-scale customs union. This means that\r\n\r\nwe  shall  have to introduce in Singapore  the  same\r\n\r\ntariff  scales as in the Federation of  Malaya.  The\r\n\r\ntrouble  about this proposal is that, while it  will\r\n\r\ngive a decided impetus to industrial growth, it will\r\n\r\nalso  dislocate  the entrepot trade to  a  dangerous\r\n\r\nextent.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the same Finance Minister who said that.\r\n\r\nThis was the 7th of June. We can have  a common market if we agree\r\n\r\nto a customs union  but  a customs union, though it will give an impetus \r\n\r\nto our common market, will dislocate our trade. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> remained standing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member does not give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If I might in fairness finish it,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, a complete customs union is  therefore\r\n\r\nnot  a  feasible  proposition for Singapore  at  the\r\n\r\npresent juncture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Exactly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> How would the common market affect\r\n\r\ntrade and industry in Singapore? The first point  to\r\n\r\nbe  noted  is  that protective tariffs in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  apply only to manufactures and not to tropical\r\n\r\nraw  materials which form the greater  part  of  our\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade.  So  that the traditional  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  in rubber, copra, coffee, tea, spices, jungle\r\n\r\nproduce  and  other goods will not  in  any  way  be\r\n\r\naffected by a common market, and that is the  common\r\n\r\nmarket we support. Mr Speaker. Let us use our terms\r\n\r\neven if he thinks he can confuse those in the coffee-shop.  Let us here use our terms with precision  and\r\n\r\nknow  what we are talking about. A common market  is\r\n\r\nintended  for purely protective duties  as  defined,\r\n\r\nprotective  duties to protect our industrial  growth\r\n\r\nin  order  to  increase employment and  not  revenue\r\n\r\nduties.  This, Mr Speaker, was on the 7th  of  June\r\n\r\nlast month and I love that phrase, I could not have\r\n\r\nput it better:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`- that, while a common customs will give a decided\r\n\r\nimpetus to industrial growth, it will also dislocate\r\n\r\nthe  entrepot  trade to a dangerous  extent  and  it\r\n\r\nwould be a dangerous gamble.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will forgive me, if I refer to it only\r\n\r\nbriefly again. Our Prime Minister on the 10th  June,\r\n\r\nwhen I said to him that his statement about a common\r\n\r\nmarket sounded very much like a customs union  - this\r\n\r\nis not on the record\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- but  the Minister for Finance shook his head in  so\r\n\r\nvigorous  a fashion that even if the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhad  not  replied, I would have been  satisfied.  He\r\n\r\nshook his head decidedly and endorsed what the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... I can assure the Member for Anson that\r\n\r\nnothing would give me more pleasure eventually  when\r\n\r\nnegotiations  have been successfully concluded  than\r\n\r\nto  publish  them in row, and I think he,  and  even\r\n\r\nmore so the merchants who have built a valuable  and\r\n\r\nlucrative trade over the years on the basis  of  our\r\n\r\nfree port, will have a great interest in seeing that\r\n\r\nall  this does not disappear in the chase of a will-o'-the-wisp for a common market.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, they will tell you, \"But, oh\r\n\r\nyes,  this is a thing of the past.\" I have read  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's speech, \"We had eight good men  and\r\n\r\ntrue  come  to  Malaya and they  have  produced  the\r\n\r\nreport.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Speaker, I want to remind you that,\r\n\r\naccording  to the report, Mr Rueff had  exactly  16\r\n\r\ndays in Malaya, a large part of which was engaged in\r\n\r\nsocial functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing about this Rueff Report - I do not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  it  makes it a unique  document,  but\r\n\r\ncertainly a very curious document, Mr Speaker.  You\r\n\r\nwill  remember that we repeatedly asked for a common\r\n\r\nmarket,  and  finally the Minister for Finance  said\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation who was using his influence to get a very\r\n\r\nimportant  official  from the  World  Bank.  Why  we\r\n\r\nourselves  could not do it, I do not know.  So  this\r\n\r\nwas  the choice of the Deputy Prime Minister of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  he came for 16 days,  although  the\r\n\r\nrest  of them spent some more time in travelling  to\r\n\r\nBorneo and other territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I want to draw your attention to is\r\n\r\nthis.  According to the first page, this report  was\r\n\r\nnot    sent   to   the   International   Bank    for\r\n\r\nReconstruction until the 25th of June. How was it in\r\n\r\nthe hands of our Government before that - in draft or\r\n\r\notherwise? It was on the 2nd July, Mr Speaker, that\r\n\r\nthe   International  Bank  for  Reconstruction   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment sent it from Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when a report is made under the aegis of the World Bank, the World Bank usually indicates its approval or disapproval of the recommendations, and a very curious feature of this report is contained in paragraph 3 of the letter of the President of this World Bank under date of 2nd July. I will read it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This report has not been given to the Executive\r\n\r\nDirectors of the International Bank arid it has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  reviewed in detail by the Management.

I would like  to\r\n\r\nstart  off with paragraph 4, Sir, and before  I  do,\r\n\r\npermit  me  just one word. 150 years  of  trial  and\r\n\r\nerror  have  built  up  an  economy  that  has  made\r\n\r\nSingapore  the greatest port in all Asia - the  fifth\r\n\r\nlargest  in  the  world  - on  which  our  population\r\n\r\nsubsists.  And I say to you, Mr Speaker. Sir,  that\r\n\r\neven  if  Rueff  was the Archangel Gabriel  and  his\r\n\r\neight  other members came from the same  domain,  we\r\n\r\nshould view with some zealous scrutiny and care  any\r\n\r\nrecommendations  which suggest a  radical  departure\r\n\r\nfrom  our  pattern of economy. But when  we  realise\r\n\r\nthat  they are human beings, albeit experts in their\r\n\r\nfashion  who can err, how much more care  should  we\r\n\r\ngive  in  considering  their  recommendations,   and\r\n\r\nparticularly,   not  merely  in  considering   their\r\n\r\nrecommendations, but in seeking, Mr Speaker, to  go\r\n\r\neven  beyond their recommendations, radically beyond\r\n\r\ntheir recommendations, in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespect of this departure from our free port status?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 4:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Trade, transport and other services account for\r\n\r\nnearly 70 per cent of employment in Singapore, about\r\n\r\n30 per cent in Malaya...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 22 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>\r\n\r\nTrying to skip that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In paragraph 31, Mr Speaker, if you\r\n\r\nwill  read it through, you will find that the entire\r\n\r\nconcept of a Common Market is based on what he calls\r\n\r\nin  the  last two lines, \"the increased mobility  of\r\n\r\nmanpower  which,  despite some  limitations,  should\r\n\r\ncharacterize the new Federation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there increased mobility of manpower in view of\r\n\r\nthe  documents  before us?

Perhaps I should read  the\r\n\r\npreceding paragraph 56:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As to new tariffs - whether protective or non-protective - a complication arises from the need to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  entrepot  trade.  Awareness  of   this\r\n\r\nproblem led to a statement in the Heads of Agreement\r\n\r\nthat the free port status of Singapore would not  be\r\n\r\nchanged   without  the  concurrence  of   both   the\r\n\r\nGovernments of the Federation and of that State. For\r\n\r\nprotective tariffs we suggest,' - I want you to notice\r\n\r\nthis,  please, Mr Speaker - `For protective  tariffs\r\n\r\nonly.' And this is their suggestion - `For protective\r\n\r\ntariffs',   not  revenue  tariffs,  `For  protective\r\n\r\ntariffs  we  suggest  , that,  subject  to  certain\r\n\r\nsafeguards, Singapore concur in advance  to  changes\r\n\r\nin  its  free  port status which may  be  introduced\r\n\r\nthrough  the  application of  such  tariffs',  - only\r\n\r\nprotective tariffs - `by the Federal Government after\r\n\r\nreceiving advice from the Tariff Board.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even poor Mr Rueff, on whose shoulders all\r\n\r\nthis  blame  is  being put, says,  \"only  protective\r\n\r\ntariffs.\"  I would recommend a change in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper provisions - not revenue duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then come to 57, the next paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We consider the uncertainties of the impact on\r\n\r\nthe   entrepot  trade  of  extending  non-protective\r\n\r\ntariffs are too great to decide safely on any  fixed\r\n\r\nschedule for harmonization now.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Prime Minister with that arrogance\r\n\r\nwhich  characterises the P.A.P., even in their  swan\r\n\r\nsong,  even in their death agonies, said, \"We  would\r\n\r\nbe fools to think that we cannot in 12 years be able\r\n\r\nto meet the whole impact of a customs union.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Mr Rueff says, and he is an economist, not just a blabberer, \"We consider that the uncertainties of the impact on the entrepot trade of extending non-protective tariffs are too great to decide safely on any fixed schedule for harmonization now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a fixed schedule for harmonization now,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker? Pity the Minister for Finance  is  not\r\n\r\nhere. He will say,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Rubbish!\" But you have five years - 1968,  1975,  is\r\n\r\nthe   ultimate  swan  song,  the  death   agony   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's free port, and it is in an exchange.  Is\r\n\r\nthat  what Rueff recommends? And the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\ntells us that he will not chase the will-o'-the-wisp\r\n\r\nfor  the  common market, and we should be so  happy,\r\n\r\nincluding  the Member for Anson. Now, Sir,  what  is\r\n\r\nthe  value  of manufacturing trade to Singapore?  In\r\n\r\nparagraph  81, ii is stated that in 1961  the  total\r\n\r\nincome  of  Singapore from manufacturing  industries\r\n\r\nwas  14  per cent only, 14 per cent in Singapore,  6\r\n\r\nper  cent in Malaya. Mr Speaker, Sir, let  us  face\r\n\r\nit.  The  whole of Annex J is intended to  bring  an\r\n\r\nimpetus to Federation industries and I will be  only\r\n\r\ntoo glad that they should have an impetus, because I\r\n\r\ndread  the  thought  that Singapore  should  be  the\r\n\r\nindustrial   area   of  the  Federation   with   its\r\n\r\nconcomitant social evils. I myself do not believe in\r\n\r\nindustry, and only industry, as a salvation  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic  position.  I  certainly  believe  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  our  fair share of  industry.  So  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  this 14 per cent, we are  to  take  the\r\n\r\ngamble,  Mr Speaker. By the way, just a side-light,\r\n\r\nwould  you look at paragraph 83, because the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  been  saying  that since they  came  to  office\r\n\r\nindustries  have increased by leaps and bounds.  Mr\r\n\r\nRueff said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In Singapore recent growth in manufacturing has\r\n\r\nbeen  less  spectacular after buoyant  progress  has\r\n\r\nbeen experienced in the 1950-57 period.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I hear nothing from the Front bench.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of elucidation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Certainly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall remained standing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

That  manufacturing\r\n\r\nhad  a buoyant experience between the years 1950 and\r\n\r\n1957.  But  we  will pass it. I do not know  whether\r\n\r\nthey are listening. Now we will go to paragraph 117.\r\n\r\nYou see at the top of page 41, Mr Speaker:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By creating a Malaysian Common Market the\r\n\r\nFederation thus would retain the valuable  Singapore\r\n\r\nmarket and, moreover, for all protected goods, would\r\n\r\nincrease the size of its protected market by over 50\r\n\r\nper  cent. [Good luck to the Federation.] This would\r\n\r\nallow  the  establishment in  the  Federation  of  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  industries for which  the  size  of  the\r\n\r\ndomestic market was hitherto inadequate for economic\r\n\r\nproduction.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now paragraph 118:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The same is true in Singapore. In recent years\r\n\r\nindustrialisation has not made rapid  progress,  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  doubt  that the gradual  adoption  of\r\n\r\nprotective tariffs by the Federation has contributed\r\n\r\nto  this slowdown. The existence of a tariff barrier\r\n\r\nhas  been an important factor in persuading a number\r\n\r\nof  firms  to  establish plants  in  the  Federation\r\n\r\nrather than in Singapore, and tariffs such as  those\r\n\r\non  paints,  soap  and  wire  mesh  have  restricted\r\n\r\nSingapore access to the Federation market.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At paragraph 123:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, both Malaya and Singapore depend too\r\n\r\nmuch on trade to be certain that the gains from  the\r\n\r\nprotection of infant industries will not  be  offset\r\n\r\nby  a  possible reduction in the income derived from\r\n\r\nexport or entrepot trades.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Even in respect of protective tariffs he is worried,\r\n\r\nand he says that you depend too much on trade to  be\r\n\r\ncertain  that  what  you gain from  employment  from\r\n\r\ninfant  industries  will not  be  offset  by  income\r\n\r\nderived from export or entrepot trades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any significant increases in the cost of\r\n\r\nproduction,  brought  about  by  protection,   could\r\n\r\nweaken the competitive position of Malaysia's export\r\n\r\ncommodities.  In  the same way, the introduction  of\r\n\r\nprotective  tariffs could affect the  costs  of  the\r\n\r\nservices  rendered  by  traders  in  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nPenang,  and  could conceivably create  difficulties\r\n\r\nfor  the entrepot trades. It is in fact the low cost\r\n\r\nof  these  services  which  has  discouraged  direct\r\n\r\nshipment   from  the  producing  to  the   consuming\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  which  has  enabled  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nPenang to play the role of intermediaries.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 126:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Expanded agricultural output on a commercial\r\n\r\nbasis  for  domestic consumption offers one  of  the\r\n\r\nmain  possibilities  for further diversification  of\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  products  which  appear to have  a  significant\r\n\r\npotential  include  fruits,  vegetables,  sugarcane,\r\n\r\nmaize,  livestock products and fish.  Common  market\r\n\r\narrangements  for  these products could  undoubtedly\r\n\r\nserve   as   an  important  stimulus  to   Malaysian\r\n\r\nproduction,  especially given the improved  long-run\r\n\r\nprospects  for  marketing in Singapore, which  will\r\n\r\nhave  to import an increasing proportion of its food\r\n\r\nrequirements.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  if you are told that our cost of living will not\r\n\r\ngo  up  very  much, remember, Mr Speaker,  that  in\r\n\r\nfuture,  in order to protect Federation agriculture,\r\n\r\nwe  will  have  duty  on fruits, on  vegetables,  on\r\n\r\nsugarcane, on maize, on livestocks and on fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, you remember I said to you that\r\n\r\nthe  Rueff Report recommended that the Tariff  Board\r\n\r\nshould  have nothing to do with revenue. It makes  a\r\n\r\nspecial  paragraph for that. You  will  find  it  at\r\n\r\nparagraph 150. But in Annex J that Tariff Board  has\r\n\r\nthe  power  to  apply  all  revenue  duties  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation to us. Paragraph 150:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As was indicated above, the Tariff Board would be\r\n\r\ncalled   upon  to  give  advice  with   respect   to\r\n\r\nprotective  tariffs, hut its jurisdiction  will  not\r\n\r\nextend to non-protective tariffs.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And   in   paragraph   156  he   pleads   that   his\r\n\r\nrecommendations  be considered as  a  whole  because\r\n\r\nthey  are  closely interrelated, and he particularly\r\n\r\nemphasised   that  the  question  of  non-protective\r\n\r\nduties  and  measures to safeguard the operation  of\r\n\r\nthe   entrepot  trade,  non-protective   duties   as\r\n\r\ndistinct from revenue duties, should not apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, in paragraph 158, just in\r\n\r\ncase there are some academicians who say that we  do\r\n\r\nnot have a free port on the other side, you will see\r\n\r\nin  line  4: \"Although Singapore enjoys a free  port\r\n\r\nstatus.\" It is true, Mr Speaker, there has  been  a\r\n\r\nvery  mild  inroad over 140 years. We  have  tax  on\r\n\r\npetrol,  on  alcohol  and  on  tobacco.  Those   are\r\n\r\nrevenue.  That is all. And in respect of  protective\r\n\r\nduties we have soaps and paints. That is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At paragraph 160, you will find that he says what\r\n\r\nin  fact  we heard the Minister for Finance  say  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of the speeches he made in the Budget.  Let\r\n\r\nus have it for the record:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The existence of the free port, however,\r\n\r\nencouraged  the  development of specialised  transit\r\n\r\nand  entrepot operations which have become the  main\r\n\r\nsource of employment in both Singapore and Penang.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  am hammering this - that the entrepot trade is the\r\n\r\nmain  source of employment and income, and  this  is\r\n\r\nwhat they intend to banish to Blakang Mati.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, paragraph 161 is a long paragraph and I will not weary you. But would you agree that that sentence in the middle in fact epitomises it? They say that there are too many difficulties for a time- table and the words are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A final judgment will have to wait until more\r\n\r\nexperience has been gained in practice.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  to the P.A.P., what does it matter if you  sell\r\n\r\nout  Singapore? I do not know, Sir. Apart  from  the\r\n\r\nexample  put forward by the Member for Hong  Lim.  I\r\n\r\ncannot understand how a human being can sell out his\r\n\r\nown people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paragraph 167, again, Mr Speaker, Sir, for the\r\n\r\nthird  time he hammers home: Do not have a  definite\r\n\r\ntime-table.  Let experience teach you. Let  me  read\r\n\r\nit. It is not very long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Mission is of the opinion that the\r\n\r\napplication  of uniform tariff policies in  Malaysia\r\n\r\nshould proceed as rapidly as is consistent with  the\r\n\r\nneed  to preserve entrepot trade, which is and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be an important source of  income  and\r\n\r\nemployment  for Malaysia. On the basis of  the  date\r\n\r\navailable, it is fairly obvious that five  years  at\r\n\r\nleast  will  be  required to put into operation  the\r\n\r\nsafeguards   and  procedures  which  are  considered\r\n\r\nessential;'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That   is   for  the  protective  tariffs   we   are\r\n\r\ndiscussing, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... on the other hand, it is not yet possible on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of such information, to determine whether\r\n\r\nsuch  a  period  would be sufficient to  enable  the\r\n\r\ntraders  to  adjust themselves to new  circumstances\r\n\r\nand to enable workers who may become redundant as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  such adjustments to be absorbed  in  new\r\n\r\nactivities.  This  process  of  adjustment  will  be\r\n\r\ngoverned  by  the  rate  at which  industrialization\r\n\r\nprogresses    and   the   common   market    becomes\r\n\r\nestablished, and it is probable that, at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  five-year period, the outstanding  difficulties\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  intractable.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is in  respect  of\r\n\r\nprotective tariffs, not revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Uniform tariff policy, man!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Paragraph 168:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`These considerations have led the Mission to the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that it would be wiser not to  take  any\r\n\r\ndecision at the present time, but to provide  for  a\r\n\r\nreview  which will be conducted at the  end  of  the\r\n\r\ntransitional period.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Mr  Speaker, if Annex J  had  ended  at  the\r\n\r\npoint  where it provides for a review, then it would\r\n\r\nat  least have been in accordance with the spirit of\r\n\r\nthis paper.

The  most\r\n\r\nimportant   source  of  income  and  employment   in\r\n\r\nSingapore and Penang:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Although important year-to-year fluctuations have\r\n\r\ntaken  place, entrepot trade has grown in importance\r\n\r\nsince  the  early  1950's. It is  difficult  at  the\r\n\r\npresent time to determine what are the prospects  of\r\n\r\nthat type of trade in the near future.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  want to stop there, Mr Speaker, because there is\r\n\r\nno  doubt that the Minister for Finance, now that he\r\n\r\nis  on the side of a customs union, is going to  say\r\n\r\nthat,  of  course, our entrepot trade  is  going  to\r\n\r\ndeteriorate  and  is  going  to  wither  away.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we are a department store at  the  cross-road  of an area which was a slump area; deep frozen\r\n\r\nin  economic misery because the imperialists change;\r\n\r\nthey are, for the first time, beginning to thaw out,\r\n\r\nto  be  conscious of their value of  their  own  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials, to benefit by their raw materials, and to\r\n\r\nbe  conscious of their need for products  that  make\r\n\r\nhuman  life  pleasant; and this  is  the  department\r\n\r\nstore  where  they  come  and  purchase.  As  those\r\n\r\ncountries grow in wealth,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that department store must grow in wealth.  Left\r\n\r\nalone,  Mr Speaker, in that policy of a free  port,\r\n\r\nSingapore  must necessarily find itself  as  at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning of a golden era of trade, but at least Mr\r\n\r\nRueff recognises that since 1950 the entrepot trade,\r\n\r\nfar  from withering as is claimed by the P.A.P., has\r\n\r\nimproved and grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We have never claimed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, paragraph 184:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the case of Singapore, the entrepot trade and\r\n\r\ntourism together contribute about 20-25 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  national  product  and  it  is  estimated  that\r\n\r\nentrepot trade employs directly about 70,000 persons\r\n\r\nor  14  per  cent  of the labour  force;  [that  is,\r\n\r\ndirectly]  but  indirect effects on  employment  and\r\n\r\nnational   income  are,  of  course,  much   higher.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it  is  very difficult  to  ascertain  the\r\n\r\nnumber of people employed in the entrepot trade,  as\r\n\r\ndistinct  from other forms of trading, there  is  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that,  unless the necessary  precautions  are\r\n\r\ntaken, a change in the conditions in which trade  is\r\n\r\nconducted  at  present may lead to  serious  adverse\r\n\r\neffects on employment, if not on national income.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  perhaps,  Mr Speaker, I should read  paragraph\r\n\r\n204,  which it is my hope the Federation of Malaysia\r\n\r\nGovernment  will become conscious  of  and  seek  to\r\n\r\nimplement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For Malaysia considered as a whole, the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade of Singapore and Penang will continue to be  a\r\n\r\nmajor  source  of  employment  and  income;  it   is\r\n\r\ntherefore  of  great importance, not  only  for  the\r\n\r\neconomy of Singapore or Penang, but also for that of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,   that  the  volume  of  that   trade   be\r\n\r\nmaintained at its highest possible level,  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  adjustments which may be required  in  view  of\r\n\r\nincreased industrialization should be made  as  easy\r\n\r\nand inexpensive as possible.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, Mr Speaker, trespassed on the indulgence\r\n\r\nof  this House for some considerable time in reading\r\n\r\npassages from this report which we have received all\r\n\r\ntoo   recently.  You  will  be  conscious  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  places the whole force of its volte-face\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  the free port of Singapore  on  the\r\n\r\nshoulders of Mr Rueff and his colleagues.  It  was,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  imperative to disclose their  falsehoods\r\n\r\nand  to  point  out  that Rueff and  his  colleagues\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  pleaded that there should  be  no  fixed\r\n\r\ntime-table, that we should learn by experience, and,\r\n\r\nabove all, that though\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  should  introduce protective duties in Singapore\r\n\r\nin  so far as it did not endanger our entrepot trade\r\n\r\nand therefore the prosperity of Malaysia as a whole,\r\n\r\nthe  question  of revenue duty was something  apart.\r\n\r\nThey  talk of a Common Market just as they  talk  of\r\n\r\nmerger,   Mr   Speaker,  because  merger   was   on\r\n\r\neverybody's   platform;  it   is   something   good,\r\n\r\nsomething  I  believe  we  all  want  with  complete\r\n\r\nsincerity. And, of course, a Common Market with  the\r\n\r\nFederation  whereby certain inroads  into  our  free\r\n\r\nport status are made not only for the benefit of our\r\n\r\nindustries   but  for  the  benefit  of   Malaysia's\r\n\r\nindustries  as  a whole, is a legitimate  aspiration\r\n\r\nwhich  we  should all support. If this  Paper  dealt\r\n\r\nonly with protective duty, though there seems to  be\r\n\r\na  somewhat  rapid - a frantically rapid - attempt  at\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of protective tariffs, I would not\r\n\r\nhave   opposed  it  except  to  indicate  a  certain\r\n\r\nanxiety.  That there should be inroads in  order  to\r\n\r\nencourage the local industries for local workers  is\r\n\r\na matter which I supported early on when that Tariff\r\n\r\nCommission Bill was read a Second time. But  as  the\r\n\r\nRueff  Report says, when you are tinkering  with  an\r\n\r\neconomic  tradition  of more  than  a  century,  you\r\n\r\nshould go only as far as experience indicates it  is\r\n\r\nsafe  to  go.  It  has sounded  a  note  of  warning\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  against speed. It has urged  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  no  timetable. You  will  remember,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  if  and  when  the Finance  Minister  will\r\n\r\nsuggest otherwise, that they recommended that  White\r\n\r\nPaper  Cmd. 33 of 1961, Article 17, should  only  be\r\n\r\namended in order to enable the Federation to  impose\r\n\r\nprotective tariff, not revenue tariff. Whatever  the\r\n\r\nvirtues,  Mr Speaker, even if I be wrong, and  this\r\n\r\nfixed  schedule of destruction of our free  port  is\r\n\r\nbelieved  to be right by the Finance Minister - I  say\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  because, Mr  Speaker,  you  will\r\n\r\nremember  that the Prime Minister in his address  to\r\n\r\nyou disclaimed all knowledge of finance and said, \"I\r\n\r\nleave it to my Finance Minister who guides me,\"  and\r\n\r\nso   he   is   the  person  responsible  for   these\r\n\r\narrangements,  one  man  affecting  the  destiny  of\r\n\r\nuntold millions of today and tomorrow even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  he  were convinced despite his protestations  of\r\n\r\nold that these provisions are for our benefit - I say\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of so radical a character  affecting\r\n\r\nour  very livelihood should not have been agreed  to\r\n\r\nwithout   reference  to  the  people  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwithout   reference   to  this   Assembly,   without\r\n\r\nreference  even  to their own political  Party,  but\r\n\r\nagreed on the back of an envelope in the Ritz  Hotel\r\n\r\nin  London after they left for London on the 25th of\r\n\r\nJune.  It  is  a most treacherous act  of  a  proved\r\n\r\nshabby Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Mr Speaker, I want to come to a personal\r\n\r\nmatter in respect of this particular debate. It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  my  intention, Mr Speaker, in  view  of  this\r\n\r\nfarce  asking us to adopt something which  makes  no\r\n\r\ndifference  whether we adopt it or not,  whether  we\r\n\r\nreject  it or not, because it is totally irrelevant;\r\n\r\nthe  judgment  is  passed, the act  of  the  British\r\n\r\nParliament has taken effect, and the machinery is in\r\n\r\nmotion.  The date of judgment is the 31st of  August\r\n\r\nand there is no Court of Appeal. This is not a Court\r\n\r\nof  Appeal from the British Parliament. So I thought\r\n\r\nI  would not continue with this farce other than  to\r\n\r\nexpose  certain  aspects of it  for  those  who  are\r\n\r\ninterested and to depart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I read in the transcript of Tuesday of the speech of the Prime Minister what I consider to be a personal threat to me and an act of intimidation. He has been so successful intimidating others; he thinks he can do it to me in this very House. It is at page 16, 30th of July. Perhaps I\r\n\r\nshould  start  at  page 15 since  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture interrupted. At the bottom of page 15  [Vol.\r\n\r\n21, No. 5, cols. 311-2]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, in return for this we have a Common Market.\r\n\r\nI  expected this to be received at least  by  right-minded  men  who  arc not Communists with  rapturous\r\n\r\napplause and praise for the Tunku, if not for me, at\r\n\r\nleast  for  the  generosity of  the  Tunku  and  his\r\n\r\nDeputy. But the Member for Anson, I think, has again\r\n\r\ngone off the beam, I read in the newspapers that  he\r\n\r\nhas  denounced  it as a sell-out: that  we  in  four\r\n\r\nyears have done more damage that the British did  in\r\n\r\nover a hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rajaratnam: Than the Japanese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  Prime Minister: Than the Japanese,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow whether he knows [that is me, Mr Speaker] that\r\n\r\nthis  is the end of an era.

I shall vote against the\r\n\r\nmotion.  If he thinks he can intimidate me  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  Mr Speaker, with the threat of  treating\r\n\r\nme as an enemy, I know the propaganda that will take\r\n\r\nplace.  \"Oh, he voted with the Barisan, He aids  the\r\n\r\nBarisan.

Therefore, because the Barisan have  milk\r\n\r\nfor  breakfast like the Communists, and I have  milk\r\n\r\nfor breakfast like the Barisan, I am a Communist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> What do you have for breakfast?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Barisan, the Communists, do not\r\n\r\nlike  eating  the flesh of their mothers,  like  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

I was not sure whether or\r\n\r\nnot  the Minister for Health would have to call  for\r\n\r\nan  ambulance with the necessary equipment  to  take\r\n\r\npeople  to  a padded cell. What is this  talk  about\r\n\r\neating  the flesh of mothers? Would any sane man  go\r\n\r\ninto  these  gruesome details? Sir, we  must  assume\r\n\r\nthat  the  hon.  Member for  Anson  is  a  sane  and\r\n\r\nrational  man  in spite of evidence to the  contrary\r\n\r\nwhich  he  himself produced in the last few minutes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose to work on the assumption  that\r\n\r\nhe has brought his mind to bear on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsubject of the Common Market, that he has studiously\r\n\r\nstudied,  as he pretends to have studied, the  Rueff\r\n\r\nReport. Annex J, and all the other documents  before\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me dispose of a few - I will go no more\r\n\r\nthan  to  call them - minor inaccuracies. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson condemns the Rueff Mission. The  man  has\r\n\r\nbeen  here for 16 days and therefore has not studied\r\n\r\nthe  subject, and is unqualified to speak; proof  of\r\n\r\nwhich  he  said appeared in the documents themselves\r\n\r\nwhen  the  World  Bank wrote to the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaying  that they do not endorse the view,  contrary\r\n\r\nto what he said is the normal World Bank practice. I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know how many World Bank reports the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  has read. They are available. The  World\r\n\r\nBank  has  sent  missions to  every  under-developed\r\n\r\ncountry in the world. In each of their reports  they\r\n\r\nsay  the views are those of the mission and not  the\r\n\r\nviews  of the World Bank. I am astounded that a  man\r\n\r\nof  his standing would make so easily mendacious and\r\n\r\ninaccurate statements of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will deal with some of the less important\r\n\r\nremarks first in regard to the Rueff Report and  the\r\n\r\nCommon Market. The Member for Anson has been reading\r\n\r\nselected  extracts from the Rueff Report to  bolster\r\n\r\nhis  case. Sometimes. Mr Speaker, he does not  even\r\n\r\nstop  at  the completed sentence. He stops right  in\r\n\r\nthe  middle  of the sentence. First,  he  read  from\r\n\r\nparagraph 83, and he read out the first sentence:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In Singapore recent growth in manufacturing has\r\n\r\nbeen  less  spectacular after buoyant  progress  had\r\n\r\nbeen experienced in the 1950-57 period.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  next  sentence, Mr Speaker, Sir,  he  did  not\r\n\r\nread:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Although comprehensive industrial statistics are\r\n\r\nlacking,  it  appears that the  increase  in  output\r\n\r\nstagnated  after  1957 until 1960, whereupon  growth\r\n\r\nresumed  during  1961 and 1962. During  this  latter\r\n\r\nperiod  the  Economic Development Board participated\r\n\r\nactively in the establishment of a number of  plants\r\n\r\nand  there  was an increase in the number  of  small\r\n\r\nmanufacturing firms. Retained imports  of  machinery\r\n\r\nalso   rose  sharply,  indicating  an  increase   in\r\n\r\ninvestment  over the depressed levels  of  1958  and\r\n\r\n1959.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  think  in  fairness, Sir, to the efforts  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, he should have said\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat.  But  no,  he  just  stopped  short  of   that\r\n\r\nparticular section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next quotation came from paragraph 87; and\r\n\r\nhere,  Sir, he wants to make a point that it is  the\r\n\r\nFederation who gained from the Common Market and not\r\n\r\nso  much  Singapore. So you will note that  he  read\r\n\r\nonly  half  the sentence, not the full sentence.  So\r\n\r\nfor  the  record, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I  read  the\r\n\r\nwhole sentence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Using G.N.P. [that is gross national product or\r\n\r\nthe   national  income]  as  a  rough  estimate   of\r\n\r\npurchasing  power,  the  total  demand  within   the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  market  [this  is  the  Common  Malaysian\r\n\r\nMarket]  will be about 52 per cent higher  than  now\r\n\r\nexisting in the Federation of Malaya...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In other words, the Federation of Malaya expands its\r\n\r\nmarket  by  52  per cent if there is a Pan-Malaysian\r\n\r\nCommon Market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`and about four times that of the present\r\n\r\nSingapore market...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, we gain 400 per cent as against  52\r\n\r\nper cent of the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson contends that the Rueff\r\n\r\nCommission is concerned only with protective  import\r\n\r\nduties.  He  claims  it makes no recommendations  on\r\n\r\nrevenue import duties and, in fact, urged upon  both\r\n\r\ngovernments not to have any review of revenue import\r\n\r\nduties  which, according to his interpretation,  has\r\n\r\nno  part in the Common Market. Sir, it is very clear\r\n\r\nin  Chapter VII, entitled \"Harmonization  of  Tariff\r\n\r\nPolicies\". It is Part II, Chapter VII, page 61.  May\r\n\r\nI  read or rather re-read paragraph 167? Because  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  that paragraph, he maintains  that  the\r\n\r\nreference is only to protective tariffs and  not  to\r\n\r\nrevenue tariffs. The report goes as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Mission is of the opinion that the\r\n\r\napplication  of uniform tariff policies in  Malaysia\r\n\r\nshould proceed as rapidly as is consistent with  the\r\n\r\nneed to preserve entrepot trade...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uniform tariff policies, Mr Speaker, mean all\r\n\r\ntariffs. And to make the meaning quite clear, may  I\r\n\r\ndraw your attention to paragraph 170? This refers to\r\n\r\nthe  review at the end of five years. The Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  said,  in  respect of  the  review  which  is\r\n\r\nprovided for in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnex  J,  that the World Bank recommended  that  it\r\n\r\nshould only cover protective tariffs and not revenue\r\n\r\ntariffs. Now, what does paragraph 170 say?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The main object of the review would be to\r\n\r\ndetermine  whether the complete ... [I  repeat]  the\r\n\r\ncomplete  harmonization of  tariffs  in  Malaysia -...'. \r\n\r\n...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  the  World  Bank goes on to  say  to  make  its\r\n\r\nmeaning clear beyond all doubt:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`or more specifically, the extension to Singapore\r\n\r\nof  the  entire  Malayan tariff - could  be  effected\r\n\r\nwithout  significant adverse effects on the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade or on employment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the review is to review the whole\r\n\r\nrange of Malayan tariffs. So the Member is obviously\r\n\r\nwrong. Either he has not properly addressed his mind\r\n\r\nto  this  report or he is incapable of understanding\r\n\r\nsimple straightforward English or he prefers to omit\r\n\r\nthe  evidence in this report that is against his own\r\n\r\npet ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I continue - paragraph 170?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Board [that is the Review Board provided for\r\n\r\nin Annex J] may find that this could be done without\r\n\r\nfurther delay...'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That   is   at  the  end  of  five  years,  complete\r\n\r\nharmonization  of  all  tariffs  including   revenue\r\n\r\ntariffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`or that a further period of grace should be\r\n\r\ngranted,  or  that the adjustment should  be  spread\r\n\r\nover  a  period  of  years,  in  accordance  with  a\r\n\r\nspecific time schedule. If the Board feels that,  to\r\n\r\novercome practical difficulties, it is necessary  to\r\n\r\nrevise  or supplement the procedures recommended  by\r\n\r\nthe Mission, it would make appropriate suggestions.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  the ground is cut completely under his feet, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir. He has been arguing on  a  completely\r\n\r\nfalse  premise,  and  once the basic  assumption  is\r\n\r\nproved  false, then the whole argument falls to  the\r\n\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson has quoted ad nauseam\r\n\r\nfrom various speeches I have made. Of course, I feel\r\n\r\nflattered  that he does pay regard to  what  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid in various Budget statements. But what does  it\r\n\r\nall  prove? Does it prove any inconsistency  between\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have  said  about  the  importance  of  the\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade - the volume of income and employment\r\n\r\ngenerated and the agreement that we reached in Annex\r\n\r\nA, does it prove any inconsistency between that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot at all. He has not given one bit of evidence nor\r\n\r\nadvance   any  argument  to  show  that,  with   the\r\n\r\nestablishment of the Common Market, there will be  a\r\n\r\ncomplete destruction of our entrepot trade. That  is\r\n\r\nthe nexus which he must establish if he were to make\r\n\r\nthis  point with the Common Market, with the  import\r\n\r\nduties and eventually revenue duties, the free  port\r\n\r\nstatus of Singapore will be so modified that it will\r\n\r\nbe  impossible  to conduct the entrepot  trade.  The\r\n\r\nentrepot trade will shrivel, as he says; it will  be\r\n\r\nburied  in  Blakang  Mati with consequent  ruin  and\r\n\r\nperdition to the rest of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose - mind you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nat  present speaking off the cuff to the many points\r\n\r\nwhich he has raised. It will happen that I will  not\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  counter arguments in the most  elegant\r\n\r\nmanner possible. But obviously, the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nhas  not  the  slightest idea of what  the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade of Singapore consists of. He says Singapore is\r\n\r\na  departmental  store. We supply  goods  from  this\r\n\r\ndepartmental store to our neighbours or they come to\r\n\r\nSingapore and do their shopping. That is his concept\r\n\r\nof Singapore's entrepot trade - a departmental store.\r\n\r\nYou buy perfume, tennis rackets, clothes, golf clubs\r\n\r\n- cameras may be. This is an absolutely inaccurate and\r\n\r\nfalse picture of Singapore's entrepot trade. Between\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds  and  three-quarters  of  the  value   of\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade consists of tropical  products  like\r\n\r\nrubber,  raw  sago, coffee, rattan,  pepper,  jungle\r\n\r\nproduce  of  various sorts, like jelutong;  dragon's\r\n\r\nblood is an important item. It is the sap of a juice\r\n\r\nwhich  is  collected in the jungles of  Sumatra  and\r\n\r\nNorth Borneo -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>\r\n\r\nNot the flesh of mothers, is it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, that is the life-blood of\r\n\r\nSingapore. That is the entrepot trade. You do not go\r\n\r\nto  Robinsons  or  Whiteaways  to  buy  a  sheet  of\r\n\r\nunmilled crepe rubber - smelly stuff - or raw sago. So\r\n\r\nobviously  his  notion of what  the  entrepot  trade\r\n\r\nconsists  of is the notion of a complete  dilettante\r\n\r\nwhose economic experience in entrepot trade has  not\r\n\r\nextended beyond Raffles Square, possibly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChange Alley. Sir, that is the stuff of the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade.  The  rubber we get from Sumatra, Sarawak,  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit from North Borneo; copra, pepper, coffee\r\n\r\nand other things from certain areas. With regard  to\r\n\r\nthat,  it  has been spelt out in Annex J  that  such\r\n\r\ntropical  produce will not come within the ambit  of\r\n\r\nthe Common Market arrangements, either now or within\r\n\r\n12  years or, for that matter, after 12 years. There\r\n\r\nwill  be no import duties on that. Annex J is  quite\r\n\r\nexplicit  on this matter, and to make it quite  sure\r\n\r\nthat  we  do  not have export duty on these  matters\r\n\r\n- because  if  you  have  an export  duty  on  rubber\r\n\r\nimposed  in  Singapore, then it makes your  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  extremely  difficult,  because  you  have  to\r\n\r\nidentify  which  parcels  of  rubber  are  from  the\r\n\r\nFederation  on  which  you have  to  collect  import\r\n\r\nduties  and which lots of rubber are from  Indonesia\r\n\r\non  which  you do not have export duty. So  we  have\r\n\r\nfrom   the   Federation's   Finance   Minister   the\r\n\r\nundertaking in Document 2 of Misc. 5 of 1963,  which\r\n\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Federal Government undertakes not to impose\r\n\r\nexport  duties  in Singapore in respect  of  primary\r\n\r\nproducts, other than minerals including oil produced\r\n\r\nin Singapore.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>You  will notice, Mr Speaker, Sir, \"including oil.\"\r\n\r\nIf  we  strike  oil in Singapore, then  the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment will have the right to impose  an  export\r\n\r\nduty  and  have  a  share  in  it,  Of  course,  the\r\n\r\ngeological structure of Singapore, which  is  mainly\r\n\r\ngranite,  is  such that there is not  the  slightest\r\n\r\nchance, so the geologists tell me, that we will ever\r\n\r\nstrike  oil. Mind you, if they are wrong and  we  do\r\n\r\nstrike  oil,  I  do not think we should  grudge  the\r\n\r\nFederation a share of the revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for the life-blood of our entrepot trade, the\r\n\r\nfree  port status is guaranteed, or else it  is  not\r\n\r\naffected by the Common Market arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what about the other one-quarter or one-third? This consists of emporium products\r\n\r\n- departmental  store stuff - clothing,  shoes,  toys,\r\n\r\ncameras and a hundred and one things. Entrepot trade\r\n\r\nin  these commodities means precisely this.  We  buy\r\n\r\nfrom  Britain, America, Switzerland, Belgium, Japan,\r\n\r\nany  source,  the best quality goods at  the  lowest\r\n\r\nprice. Because this is so, we can re-export these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoods  cheaply to surrounding countries.  Which  are\r\n\r\nthe surrounding countries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Borneo territories, Indonesia, the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  - the  greater bulk of our  re-export  of\r\n\r\nmanufactures   go  to  the  Federation   of   Malaya\r\n\r\n- something  like 60 per cent. And we  have  business\r\n\r\nwith  extraordinary places, quite apart from  South-East  Asia, Thailand, Burma, Mauritius, East Africa,\r\n\r\nsometimes in the Congo. We have got orders and  only\r\n\r\nlast week a man has gone to Ethiopia to do some  re-export business. That is the thing, but the bulk  of\r\n\r\nthe  present entrepot trade is among the territories\r\n\r\nof Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us see what happens under the Common\r\n\r\nMarket. Some of these goods we can produce; some  we\r\n\r\ncannot. For the goods that we can produce, we should\r\n\r\ncover eventually most of the consumer goods that  we\r\n\r\nimport from abroad. There is no reason why we cannot\r\n\r\neither  make  or assemble refrigerators, motor-cars;\r\n\r\ntextiles, of course, is too easy - anybody  can  make\r\n\r\ntextiles - and I have no doubt that the growth of the\r\n\r\ntextile  industry under the Common Market in  Malaya\r\n\r\nwill be a rapid and spectacular one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson says if there is a protective\r\n\r\nduty,  then  it does not matter - it is fair  enough.\r\n\r\nThat is an over-simplification of the position. Even\r\n\r\nif  it  goes  into the Common Market as a protective\r\n\r\nduty,  there may be problems connected with the  re-export  trade. Take textiles as a good  example.  Of\r\n\r\nall  the manufactured products entering into our re-export trade or the bazaar trade or the departmental\r\n\r\nstore trade, textiles and ready-made garments are by\r\n\r\nfar  the most important. The problem Singapore faces\r\n\r\nis  grave. It is an excruciatingly difficult one  at\r\n\r\nthe moment. Entrepot trade in these goods is a large\r\n\r\none,  mostly  to  the Federation of  Malaya,  but  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial amount to other parts outside  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nWe  know  that the Federation of Malaya is intending\r\n\r\nto  set  up a textile industry in the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  and that when the Tariff Advisory Board  is\r\n\r\nset up this will be one of the early proposals which\r\n\r\nwill have to be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what does Singapore do? The Member for Anson\r\n\r\nwould say, well, there is a protective duty, just go\r\n\r\nahead.  It is not so easy, Mr Speaker, Sir,If  you\r\n\r\ngo  ahead  and  put  textiles  as  a  Common  Market\r\n\r\ncommodity  and Singapore accepts a common protective\r\n\r\nimport  duty on textiles, what happens? There  is  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial   re-export   trade   of   textiles   to\r\n\r\nterritories  outside Malaysia - of the  order  of,  I\r\n\r\nthink, $150 million to $200 million. It varies  from\r\n\r\nyear to year. It is a substantial amount of textiles\r\n\r\nand  if  we  want to make sure that the  dealers  of\r\n\r\ntextiles   dealing  with  these  outside  countries,\r\n\r\nmostly  Indonesia, do not suffer, we  have  to  make\r\n\r\nspecial  provisions, not merely the ordinary  bonded\r\n\r\nwarehouse which is inadequate, because you  have  to\r\n\r\nallow  space and facilities for breaking  bulk,  for\r\n\r\ndisplay  of  samples, for re-sorting and re-packing.\r\n\r\nAnd  that will take time. Special bonded warehouses,\r\n\r\nspecial free zones will have to be set up, and if it\r\n\r\nis  not  done  in  an  adequate and  a  sufficiently\r\n\r\nexpeditious manner, the entrepot trade and  the  re-export trade will suffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if we say, because of the\r\n\r\nimportance  of the entrepot trade, we  exercise  our\r\n\r\noption  of  remaining out of the  Common  Market  in\r\n\r\nrespect of textiles for one year, then what will the\r\n\r\nresult  be?  The  result will be  that  the  textile\r\n\r\nmanufacturers will go to the Federation, which  will\r\n\r\nhave an early start; and when the supply of textiles\r\n\r\nhas  flooded the Malayan market, you may  find  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  does not have an adequate  share  of  the\r\n\r\ntextile industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the typical problems and considerations\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have to bear in mind when we  come  to  a\r\n\r\ndecision  - not,  Mr  Speaker,  about  burying   the\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade in the cemetery at Blakang  Mati  or\r\n\r\neating  the flesh of your mothers, not that sort  of\r\n\r\nrubbish!  We  make concrete cost calculations,  work\r\n\r\nout  possible engineering programmes to  make  these\r\n\r\nbonded   warehouses   and   free   zone   facilities\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other problems connected with this. The\r\n\r\nquestion of a protective duty, which he dismisses as\r\n\r\nof   very   little   complexity,   raises   enormous\r\n\r\ncomplications, in fact. Take motor spare parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a large entrepot trade in motor spare\r\n\r\nparts.  Supposing we go for assembly of  motor-cars,\r\n\r\nand   there   are  several  proposals   before   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to establish motor-car assembly plants in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It  is  a useful industry;  it  provides\r\n\r\nemployment, generates subsidiary industries for  the\r\n\r\nmanufacture of simpler components, upholstery in the\r\n\r\nprocess of assembling - that sort of thing - tyres, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  and batteries. Right, what happens  to  the\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade  in spare parts?  Once  there  is  a\r\n\r\nprotective  duty - and this is the point  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson does not understand, he has not the  mind\r\n\r\nto grasp this businessman's angle - once there is an\r\n\r\nimport duty on these goods, then if you go to a shop\r\n\r\nand  buy,  say,  spare parts - like a carburettor  or\r\n\r\nwhatever  you  will  - then the  price  is  high.  It\r\n\r\nincludes duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you want to take out a piece of component\r\n\r\n- say  a  carburettor - and wish to  re-export  it  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  You  cannot go to the Customs  and  say,\r\n\r\n\"Look, there is a tax on this; give me back the  tax\r\n\r\nyou  have collected, because [want to sell it  at  a\r\n\r\ncheap  price.\" That is not possible. The  free  port\r\n\r\nstatus has been an aid to our entrepot trade because\r\n\r\nit  does not create problems of this nature - customs\r\n\r\nduties  being imposed and then customs duties having\r\n\r\nto   be   refunded.   And  generally   the   Customs\r\n\r\nadministration will never agree to a refund  of  tax\r\n\r\ncollected once the case is broken, once the bulk  is\r\n\r\nbroken, once the separate identity of goods has been\r\n\r\nlost,  because  it opens avenues for  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even when that does not happen in Singapore,\r\n\r\nMembers  may be interested to hear of a  case  where\r\n\r\none  of  the cigarette manufacturers tried to  cheat\r\n\r\nthe  Customs.  There is a duty on  imported  tobacco\r\n\r\nleaf. Then when you export the leaves, you get  what\r\n\r\nis called the \"draw-back\". You paid duty on it; when\r\n\r\nyou  re-export because it is not used in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nno  duty is paid. One bright businessman decided  to\r\n\r\nmake a claim from the Customs Department of the duty\r\n\r\nwhich  had been paid on the tobacco leaves. When  we\r\n\r\nexamined the case, we found stones in it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even in this matter where the procedure is\r\n\r\nfairly  straightforward, people try to cheat customs\r\n\r\nduty.  Therefore,  the  solution  whereby  you   can\r\n\r\nprotect  the  re-export trade - it is  the  re-export\r\n\r\ntrade  that is the core, that is the consumer  goods\r\n\r\nentrepot trade - is to have bonded warehouses  and  a\r\n\r\nfree zone where goods designed for re-export outside\r\n\r\nMalaysia are stored, duty free, First, the price  is\r\n\r\nnot  increased. You can still compete in your export\r\n\r\nmarket  with  Indonesia or Burma  or  Thailand,  and\r\n\r\ncustoms facilities are reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Member for Anson does not understand\r\n\r\nthis  simple  proposition. He equates import  duties\r\n\r\nwith  the  death  of the entrepot trade.  He  quoted\r\n\r\nSingapore as the fifth largest port. May I give  him\r\n\r\nthe  example of the world's largest port - the  first\r\n\r\nlargest  port,  Rotterdam? We handle  eight  to  ten\r\n\r\nmillion  tons  of  cargo a year;  Rotterdam  handles\r\n\r\nninety  million tons of cargo a year. And  Rotterdam\r\n\r\nworks  in the regime of a full Customs Union. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  free  port  and, with the  starting  of  the\r\n\r\nEuropean  Common  Market, customs duties  have  been\r\n\r\nincreased in many of the goods that went through the\r\n\r\nport of Rotterdam. Has it brought Rotterdam down  to\r\n\r\na shambles? Do we have to bury the port of Rotterdam\r\n\r\nin Blakang Mati?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if he had taken the trouble to go through\r\n\r\nvarious  reports which are available, he would  have\r\n\r\nfound that after the European Common Market the port\r\n\r\nof  Rotterdam has increased in prosperity  and  that\r\n\r\nits   entrepot  trade,  far  from  diminishing,  has\r\n\r\nincreased in volume and value. Why? Because  of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  prosperity of the whole  European  Economic\r\n\r\nCommunity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member may not be able to follow the\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  import  duties,  free  zones,\r\n\r\nbonded  warehouses, customs drawbacks and all  these\r\n\r\nother  technicalities. Let him understand  this  one\r\n\r\nconcrete  example  - of  the  world's  largest   port\r\n\r\noperating within the regime of a full Customs Union,\r\n\r\ngoing  from  strength  to  strength.  And  there  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely no reason why we in Singapore  under  the\r\n\r\nCommon Market\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrangements  should  not be as  successful  as  the\r\n\r\ntraders of Rotterdam. I think few people will  claim\r\n\r\nthat  our  traders  are  less  resourceful  or  less\r\n\r\nindustrious than the traders of Rotterdam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was waiting, Mr Speaker, for a coherent,\r\n\r\nlogical,  step-by-step argument, with  illustrations\r\n\r\nby  way  of products and businesses, as to how  this\r\n\r\nCommon Market Agreement as enshrined in Annex  J  of\r\n\r\nthe  Constitutional Document must  bring  about  the\r\n\r\ndownfall  of  Singapore. I see no argument.  I  have\r\n\r\nheard  endless quotations of what I said,  what  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister said, what the Rueff Mission said  on\r\n\r\nthe  importance of the entrepot trade, why it should\r\n\r\nnot  be  allowed  to  run down. We  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nsentiments,  but  we  do not agree  with  the  basic\r\n\r\nassumption  that if you have a Common  Market,  then\r\n\r\nthat  is  the death of the entrepot trade. The  case\r\n\r\nhas not been proved. As it is, I would have said  no\r\n\r\ndefence  would  be  called for  if  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly had special training in these matters,  but\r\n\r\nsince   these   are  somewhat  unfamiliar   matters,\r\n\r\nparticularly Common Market and the Customs regime, I\r\n\r\nfeel obliged to explain in some detail that what the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson has been saying for the  last  two\r\n\r\nhours on the common market is absolute drivel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, just a word about revenue duties. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson understood the meaning of revenue duties,\r\n\r\nthat is, duties on the import of goods which are not\r\n\r\nmade anywhere in Malaysia. Those are revenue duties.\r\n\r\nHe said it is not in the Rueff Report. I pointed out\r\n\r\nthat  it is in the Rueff Report. And he said, \"Well,\r\n\r\nwhy  should  it  not be part of the Common  Market?\"\r\n\r\nThis  becomes the Customs Union. He misquoted me  in\r\n\r\none  of  my Budget statements, the last one I think,\r\n\r\nin  which I said that agreement on the Common Market\r\n\r\nwould  be  easy  if  we were prepared  to  accept  a\r\n\r\nCustoms Union. True enough. There was nothing  wrong\r\n\r\nwith   that.   By   that   I  meant   an   immediate\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  a  full-scale  Customs  Union.  A\r\n\r\nfurther  two  sentences from that, I made  it  quite\r\n\r\nclear there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the introduction of a full-scale Customs Union\r\n\r\nis  not appropriate in Singapore now, but phasing it\r\n\r\nover  twelve years is a completely different matter.\r\n\r\nFirst,  for  five years we have all  the  safeguards\r\n\r\nagainst  revenue duties; at the end  of  five  years\r\n\r\nthere  is  the Review Board which should  take  into\r\n\r\naccount these matters and review the whole range  of\r\n\r\nMalayan  tariffs, not merely Singapore tariffs,  but\r\n\r\nthe  whole  range of Malayan tariffs.  I  have  very\r\n\r\nlittle doubt, Mr Speaker, Sir, that at that review,\r\n\r\nwhich  should be an important event in our  economic\r\n\r\nhistory, there will be a fundamental change  in  the\r\n\r\ntariff system of Malaya and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain this point? The Malayan tariff\r\n\r\nsystem  is  a colonial system. That was  the  system\r\n\r\nwhich  Malaya inherited from the colonial  days  and\r\n\r\nthey have not done very much basically to change the\r\n\r\ncharacter  of  import tariffs.  There  was  no  time\r\n\r\nperhaps,  and possibly no reason to do  so.  In  all\r\n\r\nindustrial  countries  and  in  all  well  developed\r\n\r\nsocieties, an import duty fulfils one function, that\r\n\r\nis, the protection of domestic industries. It is not\r\n\r\nto  get money because there are other more equitable\r\n\r\nforms  of raising revenue such as income tax, estate\r\n\r\nduties,  sales  tax, this, that and the  other.  The\r\n\r\nfunction  of  an  import duty  is  to  protect  your\r\n\r\ndomestic industries. But in the British colonies  - I\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  French  have a different  system  - the\r\n\r\nimport duty had been the major source of revenue  to\r\n\r\nthe Government. It is an iniquitous form of taxation\r\n\r\nin  so  far  as  it levies taxes on food  and  other\r\n\r\nnecessities resulting in the poor having  to  pay  a\r\n\r\ndisproportionate  burden  of  tax  collected  b  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  And largely in all British territories,\r\n\r\nthe  same  structure of import duty exists,  and  in\r\n\r\nmost  of  them  the same structure of import  tariff\r\n\r\ncontinues  after independence has been  achieved.  I\r\n\r\nventure  to  suggest that at the first  review  made\r\n\r\nfive years from the date of the establishment of the\r\n\r\nCommon Market, we can expect radical changes in  the\r\n\r\ntariff system of Malaysia, which will mean that many\r\n\r\nof  the more depressing items of import duties  will\r\n\r\ndisappear if they are not manufactured here, and in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nits  place  possibly  the retention  of  tariffs  or\r\n\r\nimport  duties  on  perhaps luxury  and  semi-luxury\r\n\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after five years, and within 12 years from now,\r\n\r\nthe  fact that at the end of 12 years we have to  go\r\n\r\ninto  a  full-scale Customs regime with the rest  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  does  not  bother me very  much,  for  two\r\n\r\nreasons. Firstly, as I have said, they are likely to\r\n\r\nsee  fundamental changes in the tariff structure for\r\n\r\nMalaysia. Secondly, if within 12 years we  have  not\r\n\r\nmade   a  success  of  the  Common  Market  or   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation plans have gone  haywire,  then  I\r\n\r\nsay, items like revenue duties and such matters woud\r\n\r\nbe  trivialities compared to the major problems that\r\n\r\nwill  be  facing  us then. I have a note  here.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. I said just now that at the end of 12 years\r\n\r\nwe  would enter into a full-scale Customs Union with\r\n\r\nthe   rest  of  Malaysia.  In  fact,  that   is   an\r\n\r\ninaccuracy,  and I am glad that one of  my  officers\r\n\r\nhere  has  pointed  out that this  will  not  be  so\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the exclusion of primary products  from\r\n\r\nthe Common Market and the import and export duty  on\r\n\r\nprimary  products is a substantial  element  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  tariff system. Sir, that is for the  moment\r\n\r\nabout  as  much  as I want to say in  reply  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson in respect of the Common Market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to deal with some other points raised\r\n\r\nby  other  Members  on  the  financial  arrangements\r\n\r\nnegotiated in London. The constitutional  and  other\r\n\r\naspects  of the Malaysia Agreement, I will leave  to\r\n\r\nmy   colleagues.  Sir,  my  task  to  reply  to  the\r\n\r\ncriticisms of the Barisan Sosialis and the U.P.P. is\r\n\r\nat  one and the same time both easy and arduous.  It\r\n\r\nis  easy  because  to  refute  their  arguments  and\r\n\r\ndestroy  the  so-called evidence that  they  put  up\r\n\r\npresents no difficulty whatsoever. The logic used by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown is, as usual, as distorted\r\n\r\nand  as twisted as his own mind. The evidence  which\r\n\r\nhe uses in support of his arguments is largely based\r\n\r\non taking words and sentences from the documents and\r\n\r\nfrom speeches of Ministers completely out o context.\r\n\r\nYou will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that yesterday\r\n\r\nyou had to pull him up on that point; that he just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nread the last sentence of one document claiming that\r\n\r\nit  supported his point of view, and then you  asked\r\n\r\nhim  to  read  the  whole  document  which  gave   a\r\n\r\ncompletely  different picture. As I  have  said,  to\r\n\r\npursue  every misrepresentation and every  falsehood\r\n\r\nwhich  abounds in his 6\u00ac hour address  is  a  simple\r\n\r\nmatter, hut, at the same time, it is going to be  an\r\n\r\narduous one because there are so many o them, and  I\r\n\r\ndo  not wish to tax the patience and forbearance  of\r\n\r\nthis  House, already strained to the limit by  long-winded,  illogical  and  interminable  speeches   by\r\n\r\ncertain Members of the Opposition. So I will confine\r\n\r\nmyself  only  to the major issues.  If  I  may  pass\r\n\r\njudgment  on  the  performance  of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown   yesterday   and   the   night   before,\r\n\r\nregardless   of  the  performance   of   the   human\r\n\r\nintellect, grappling with momentous intricate issues\r\n\r\nbefore  the country, I get the impression  that  his\r\n\r\nmind  is woefully inadequate to the task. I get  the\r\n\r\nidea  of  a computer, a small feeble one,  that  has\r\n\r\ngone  wrong,  gone  mad,  fed  by  the  wrong  data,\r\n\r\nproducing the wrong answers. Sir, his performance is\r\n\r\nsimilar  to that of a child who has been  trying  to\r\n\r\nmaster   the  multiplication  tables,  and,   having\r\n\r\nachieved  indifferent success in this, then  decided\r\n\r\nto  take  a  leap  and try his hand at  differential\r\n\r\ncalculus. It is not unexpected that errors of  logic\r\n\r\nwere  perpetrated at each and every stage.  The  odd\r\n\r\nthing is that his colleagues in the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nappear to be genuinely impressed by his performance.\r\n\r\nSo  I  conclude that not only are they  ignorant  of\r\n\r\nsimple  multiplications there  is  also  some  doubt\r\n\r\nwhether  they  understand how  to  add  and  how  to\r\n\r\nsubtract. At one stage I had some doubts whether the\r\n\r\nmain  performer  himself, the hero  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  the Member for Queenstown, knows  how  to\r\n\r\nadd  and how to subtract. Late on the night of  30th\r\n\r\nJuly,  I entered the Chamber and listened with  some\r\n\r\nastonishment  to  the Member for  Queenstown  saying\r\n\r\nthat the total contribution Singapore has to make to\r\n\r\nthe  Federal Government is $163 million. May I quote\r\n\r\nfrom page 79 of Hansard of 30th July (col. 412)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As I say, Sir, if we add this figure of $3\r\n\r\nmillion   and  $36  million  to  the  $124   million\r\n\r\ncalculated from the 40 per cent Federal revenue,  we\r\n\r\nsee  that  the Singapore Government has to  pay  the\r\n\r\nFederation  every year $124 million plus $3  million\r\n\r\nplus $36 million, and that gives us a figure of $163\r\n\r\nmillion.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, there are two things wrong with his arithmetic.\r\n\r\nFirst,  the  $36  million  which  he  says  is   the\r\n\r\nrecurrent  expenditure  for  Broadcasting,  Airport,\r\n\r\nDefence,   etc.,  is  in  fact  not  the   recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure for Broadcasting, Airport, and  Defence.\r\n\r\nThat  statement is made at the top of  page  79  and\r\n\r\nalso at the top of page 78, third line. Broadcasting\r\n\r\nremains   a   State  Department  and  we   make   no\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the  Federation  for  it.  Defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure is not included in the $36 million.  The\r\n\r\n$36 million, so far as I can discover, refers to the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government's estimate  of  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  departments  other  than  Defence   and\r\n\r\nInternal Security, and this will include departments\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Immigration, Prisons, Civil Aviation,  the\r\n\r\nLaw   Courts   and  Judiciary,  and  other   Federal\r\n\r\nDepartments operating in Singapore. This  amount  of\r\n\r\n$36  million has already been included in  the  $124\r\n\r\nmillion covered by the 40 per cent contribution. You\r\n\r\ncannot, therefore, add the same amount twice as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown was doing.  As  for  the  $3\r\n\r\nmillion    development   expenditure   on    Federal\r\n\r\ndepartments  in Singapore, this is only the  ceiling\r\n\r\nfigure  proposed  at  one stage,  and  there  is  no\r\n\r\nagreement that we will pay this amount regardless of\r\n\r\nwhat  is  spent. We pay only for what  is  spent  in\r\n\r\nSingapore on Federal departments like Post  Offices,\r\n\r\nCivil  Aviation, Telecommunications  and  such  like\r\n\r\nmatters.  It is obvious that we want these  services\r\n\r\nto be maintained at the highest level of efficiency.\r\n\r\nWe  are an important business centre. Our efficiency\r\n\r\ndepends   on   a   good   and   fast   postal    and\r\n\r\ntelecommunications service and an efficient  airport\r\n\r\nAnd  in  order  to  avoid the possibility  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  departments  may ha  starved  of  capital\r\n\r\nfunds  for  their development, we have  agreed  that\r\n\r\nthis pavement should be made, and I think this is  a\r\n\r\nwise and prudent movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now go to the more important\r\n\r\nallegations  which he has made.  On  the  amount  of\r\n\r\ncontribution   which   we  make   to   the   Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment, his one point of criticism is that while\r\n\r\nearly  in 1962 our own private estimate was that  we\r\n\r\nshould be contributing something like $78 million  a\r\n\r\nyear now, the figure agreed to is considerably more.\r\n\r\nSir,  the full explanation for this appears  in  the\r\n\r\nDocuments before the House. It is in Misc. 4 of 1963\r\n\r\nwhich  gives the full details and how this  increase\r\n\r\nhas  taken  place. The reasons are clearly available\r\n\r\nif  only  he  will take pains to read the  documents\r\n\r\nthere.  Early  in  1962, there was no  confrontation\r\n\r\npolicy,  and further the estimates we made in  early\r\n\r\n1962  did  not  take  into  account  the  additional\r\n\r\nFederal expenditure that would be necessary with the\r\n\r\nentry  of  the Borneo territories into Malaysia.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time,  this was still an open issue,  and  the\r\n\r\nterms and conditions and so on had not been settled.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  if my recollection serves me right,  that\r\n\r\nwas the time when North Borneo certainly became very\r\n\r\napprehensive  about  the  possibility   of   joining\r\n\r\nMalaysia - an attitude which they changed, of  course,\r\n\r\nquite  rapidly  once they knew what  Malaysia  stood\r\n\r\nfor.  Well,  that  was  one element  explaining  the\r\n\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the greatest single element is the tremendous\r\n\r\nincrease in the defence expenditure and the internal\r\n\r\nsecurity expenditure which the Federation Government\r\n\r\nhas  planned  to  embark upon. In effect,  it  meant\r\n\r\ndoubling  or  more than doubling their military  and\r\n\r\npolice strength. This obviously is a matter on which\r\n\r\nthe Federal Government is the competent authority to\r\n\r\nmake  a judgment. But so far as we are concerned,  I\r\n\r\nwould  have  thought that it would be a self-evident\r\n\r\nproposition, that an independent country  must  have\r\n\r\nthe means to defend its territorial integrity. It is\r\n\r\nknown even to the meanest intellect that the cost of\r\n\r\nmodern  armament  is high. These  are  some  evident\r\n\r\npropositions.  And  here  the  Barisan's   line   of\r\n\r\nargument   is  self-contradictory.  In   the   first\r\n\r\ninstance,  they  grumble  about  the  high  rate  of\r\n\r\ncontribution which results from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincreased  defence  costs. At the  same  time,  they\r\n\r\nobject  to  the  defence treaty  which  the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment has with the British Government and which\r\n\r\nwe  have  extended to cover the whole  of  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nSir,  they can take one stand or the other, but they\r\n\r\ncannot embrace both positions. If they say the  rate\r\n\r\nof  contribution is high because defence expenditure\r\n\r\nis  high, then they should have welcomed the defence\r\n\r\npact  because  that  prevents the  expenditure  from\r\n\r\ngoing even higher still. We live in a turbulent  age\r\n\r\nand in a particularly troublesome and turbulent part\r\n\r\nof  the  world - South-East Asia. Malaysia  will,  by\r\n\r\nworld  standards,  be a small country  in  terms  of\r\n\r\npopulation  and wealth. Even in the case  of  larger\r\n\r\nand  more powerful countries, we see that they found\r\n\r\nit  to their advantage to have alliances and defence\r\n\r\ntreaties  among themselves. What is  so  wrong  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia  observing this widely practised  principle\r\n\r\nand entering into similar arrangements? if, however,\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan maintains that it is wrong for Malaysia\r\n\r\nto  enter  into a defence pact with another country,\r\n\r\nthen, instead of objecting to the large increase  in\r\n\r\ndefence  expenditure which the Federation Government\r\n\r\nis  to  undertake, they should ask for an even  more\r\n\r\nsubstantial increase. If we were to have  a  defence\r\n\r\nforce  for Malaysia capable of taking on all corners\r\n\r\n- nations with populations ten times larger than ours\r\n\r\n- we  should  have to spend probably more  than  four\r\n\r\ntimes the amount that is being planned for the  next\r\n\r\nfive  years.  And even this tremendous expansion  in\r\n\r\ndefence  expenditure may not be adequate  to  ensure\r\n\r\nprotection. Of course, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis are\r\n\r\nnot   interested  in  maintaining  the   territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity  f  our  new  nation, Malaysia.  Everybody\r\n\r\nknows  that  they are in full sympathy  with  forces\r\n\r\noutside   the  country,  foreign  powers   who   are\r\n\r\ndetermined to disrupt Malaysia. The Barisan are  the\r\n\r\ntruly  anti-national elements among us. They see  as\r\n\r\ntheir  major  task the subversion of  Malaysia  from\r\n\r\nwithin   to   supplement   pressure   and   possible\r\n\r\naggression from outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 31st August, it is not for us in Singapore\r\n\r\nto say what is the proper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreatment  that should be meted out to  such  people\r\n\r\nwho  are bent on destroying the nation. As the House\r\n\r\nknows,  these are matters for the Federal Government\r\n\r\nwhich  would  be  in  charge  of  defence,  external\r\n\r\naffairs and internal security. I only want to stress\r\n\r\nto  the  Barisan the criminal folly of  their  ways.\r\n\r\nThey now have only 29 days left during which time if\r\n\r\nthey behave themselves and refrain from wrecking the\r\n\r\npeace   of  the  country,  they  have  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nassurance  of  their personal safety. But  when  the\r\n\r\ncurtain  drops after 31st August - they may  find  it\r\n\r\nless  amusing, Mr Speaker, Sir, with the  entry  of\r\n\r\nnew dramatis personoe - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

First,   I  shall   deal   with   those\r\n\r\nobservations  appearing in pages 62 and  63  of  the\r\n\r\nHansard (Unrevised transcript). Sir, he claims  that\r\n\r\nthe surplus of the Singapore Government, running  at\r\n\r\nthe  rate of $100 million or so a year, is  not  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  prudent  expenditure and  efficient  tax\r\n\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf  I  may quote him, first paragraph, page 62 [col.\r\n\r\n384], he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Until 25th May, 1963, the Prime Minister had been\r\n\r\ndeceiving  the people with talks of surpluses  which\r\n\r\nhe  claimed  are  the result of a prudent  and  good\r\n\r\ngovernment. We say, Sir, it is nothing of that sort.\r\n\r\nThe early surpluses in Singapore were the result  of\r\n\r\ndownright inefficient and incompetent government.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  he goes on to say our Government \"did not  have\r\n\r\nthe time to use the money of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  voted  for  in  this  Legislative  Assembly  on\r\n\r\nconstructive   projects  to  help  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"  I  think he really  meant  construction\r\n\r\nprojects, Mr Speaker, Sir. Now, be that as it  may.\r\n\r\nAnd   he   said  surplus  means  in  effect   under-expenditure  and  under-use  in  relation  to  these\r\n\r\nconstruction projects. The Member for Queenstown has\r\n\r\nmade this observation so often that I think the time\r\n\r\nhas  now come to nail the lie. He has been a  Member\r\n\r\nof  this Assembly for more than four years now,  and\r\n\r\nhe  has been through the Budget sessions from  1959,\r\n\r\n1960,  1961  and 1962 - four Budget Sessions  in  all\r\n\r\n- and  obviously  he still does not  understand  that\r\n\r\neach year we have two Budgets, two sets of Estimates\r\n\r\n- one  for recurrent expenditure and one for  capital\r\n\r\nexpenditure,   the   Ordinary  Estimates   and   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates. In  fact,  I  wonder  if  he\r\n\r\nunderstood  the  meaning  of  the  words  \"recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure\" and \"capital expenditure\". I asked  him\r\n\r\nthis  question two nights ago and failed  to  get  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the annual surpluses appear in the Estimates\r\n\r\nof  recurrent expenditure, that is, they  appear  in\r\n\r\nthe Ordinary Estimates. Recurrent expenditure of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  means the normal running expenditure  of\r\n\r\nGovernment departments, salaries of civil  servants,\r\n\r\npurchases  of  goods  and  services,  petroleum  for\r\n\r\nlorries,  cars,  paper,  electricity,  - items   like\r\n\r\nthese.  As against this normal recurrent expenditure\r\n\r\nwe get certain items of revenue - from taxes, licence\r\n\r\nfees,  and  so  on. And the surpluses arise  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Estimates - if your revenue  is  more  than\r\n\r\nyour expenditure then there is a surplus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,  on  the  other hand, construction  expenditure\r\n\r\nappears in the Development Estimates and not in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary Estimates. Therefore, whether there is  any\r\n\r\nspending,   under-spending   or   over-spending   on\r\n\r\nconstruction projects in the Development  Estimates,\r\n\r\nsuch  matters  have  no hearing  whatsoever  on  the\r\n\r\nsurpluses  earned  on  current account.  This  again\r\n\r\nproves the complete lack of grasp of the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, who at the present moment is not  paying\r\n\r\nattention to my - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

He is addressing the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Well, my only concern, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is that matters of public interest  - I\r\n\r\nam trying, Mr Speaker, Sir, to do a public service,\r\n\r\nby  educating  the  leader of  an  important  Party.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  he prefers to wallow  in  a  state  of\r\n\r\nignorance, so be it. But may I advise him - or rather\r\n\r\nrepeat my advice - that before he embarks on problems\r\n\r\nof  differential  calculus, he  should  first  learn\r\n\r\nsimple  arithmetic: how to add and how to  subtract?\r\n\r\nSo  what  the Member for Queenstown says,  that  our\r\n\r\nsurpluses  are due to under-expenditure  on  capital\r\n\r\ndevelopment is complete nonsense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then goes further to allege that the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  was  deliberately  misleading   the\r\n\r\ncountry when the Prime Minister said that during the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  between  the  Federal  and   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernments in Kuala Lumpur, the Federal  Government\r\n\r\nwants to take the whole of Singapore's surpluses, in\r\n\r\nthe  first instance, and at a later stage,  relented\r\n\r\nand stated that they were satisfied with half of our\r\n\r\nsurpluses.  Now  he  said  that  the  position   was\r\n\r\ncompletely untrue. Sir, the documents which we  have\r\n\r\npresented,  Misc. 4 of 1963, give all  the  evidence\r\n\r\nand  all the details. In fact, if you will refer  to\r\n\r\npages   48  and  49  and  50,  you  will   see   the\r\n\r\ncalculations   in   the  paper  submitted   by   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government. Page 49,  the  last  portion\r\n\r\n\"Apportionment Percentages\" with surplus,  how  much\r\n\r\nthey  take,  how much we take; without surplus,  how\r\n\r\nmuch they take, how much we take. A similar exercise\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  page  50. You will note various percentages  are\r\n\r\nset out, depending on whether there is a sharing  of\r\n\r\nsurplus,  of  half surplus, or no surplus.  I  would\r\n\r\nhave  thought the position is quite clear.  Yet  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown has the effrontery to make the\r\n\r\nclaim  that  until  the 25th May,  1963,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was trying to mislead the people, but after\r\n\r\nthe 25th May, he said that the Prime Minister was no\r\n\r\nlonger  misleading the people. What is the evidence,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, on which he claims  to  base  his\r\n\r\nconclusions?  To prove that the Prime  Minister  had\r\n\r\nbeen  deceiving the people, he referred to a  letter\r\n\r\nin  the Straits Times of the 25th May written by  an\r\n\r\nofficial  of the Federal Treasury. May I  read  what\r\n\r\nthe Member said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In a letter to the Straits Times Mr Abdullah\r\n\r\nAyub, Deputy Controller of Supply in the Federation,\r\n\r\nrevealed that the negotiations were in fact  on  the\r\n\r\npercentage of payment of Singapore Federal taxes  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation.  He said that once  the  percentage\r\n\r\npayment  had  been fixed, each Government  would  be\r\n\r\nresponsible for its own Budget, and the question  of\r\n\r\ndeficit or surplus does not arise. Sir, this  was  a\r\n\r\ngreat  blow to the P.A.P. The letter, in fact,  says\r\n\r\nthat  the  Prime Minister has not been  telling  the\r\n\r\npeople  the  truth, because all the time  it  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  a percentage, and now he is talking  and\r\n\r\ntelling the people it was a matter of surpluses.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the Member for Queenstown accepts that the\r\n\r\nletter  of  the Federation official to  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  sets  out  the  genuine  position.  Sir,  how\r\n\r\nfoolish  can a man be? If the Member for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nhad  been  in  my place, he would have accepted  the\r\n\r\nposition  as  set out by the Federation Treasury.  I\r\n\r\nshudder  what  would have happened  to  the  country\r\n\r\nthen.  He would have surrendered our surpluses,  and\r\n\r\nmore, to the Federal Government without even knowing\r\n\r\nit.   He  would  have  been  completely  bamboozled,\r\n\r\noutwitted  and  outmanoeauvred  by  the  Federation.\r\n\r\nSurely,  Sir,  he  does not believe  that  once  the\r\n\r\npercentage  is  fixed, the question  of  surplus  or\r\n\r\ndeficit  does not arise. By way of illustration,  in\r\n\r\norder that I can make the position so clear that  it\r\n\r\nwill  penetrate his skull: now let us  suppose  that\r\n\r\nthe percentage of contribution had been fixed at  90\r\n\r\nper  cent,  that is to say, 90 per cent  of  Federal\r\n\r\ntaxes  in  Singapore goes to the Central Government.\r\n\r\nDoes he not think that Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  then be faced with a fearsome deficit when  it\r\n\r\nhas  to  meet  the expenditure of Singapore's  State\r\n\r\nDepartments?  If  he  still cannot  understand  this\r\n\r\nproposition  - and  I see no light  of  comprehension\r\n\r\ndawning  on  his  face - then I can  only  repeat  my\r\n\r\nadvice,  and  perhaps  persuade  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation  to admit the Member for Queenstown  to  a\r\n\r\nPrimary  School where he can re-learn the arithmetic\r\n\r\nwhich he has forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Member objects to loans. Why, he asks,\r\n\r\nshould we give loans to the Borneo territories  when\r\n\r\nwe  need it ourselves? Every under-developed country\r\n\r\nin  this world, almost by definition, needs capital.\r\n\r\nBut in Malaysia, Sir, Singapore will be a member  of\r\n\r\na family of States, one of the wealthiest members of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  of  Malaysia.  The  Borneo  States,\r\n\r\nthough   they   have  the  potential  for   economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, are more short of money than we are. It\r\n\r\nis a matter of elementary fair play and justice that\r\n\r\nthe  more well-to-do should assist the less well-to-do if it is within his means to do so. It applies to\r\n\r\nrelationships  between persons and it  applies  with\r\n\r\nequal   force   to  relationships  between   States,\r\n\r\nparticularly  between States in  the  Federation.  I\r\n\r\nmade  this  clear in my Budget statement  last  June\r\n\r\n- that  it  would be wrong for Singapore to  adopt  a\r\n\r\nselfish  policy.  If  we try to hog  everything  for\r\n\r\nourselves, then this will create envy and resentment\r\n\r\ntowards us among the less developed States. And with\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in the long run, this will be against  our\r\n\r\nown  self-interest.  And on grounds  of  enlightened\r\n\r\nself-interest alone, I would have thought it obvious\r\n\r\nthat  financial assistance to the more needy  States\r\n\r\nof   Malaysia  is  a  sound  proposition,  both   on\r\n\r\npolitical grounds and on economic considerations.  I\r\n\r\nconsider  the terms of the loan eminently  fair  and\r\n\r\njust  and  reasonable. I do not agree that there  is\r\n\r\nany  case for us to make an out-right grant  to  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories, for we are not all that wealthy.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, giving money away free is bad, bad both\r\n\r\nfor  the donor as well as for the recipient. For the\r\n\r\nrecipient,  free  money means  an  invitation  to  a\r\n\r\nspending spree, but when assistance is made  in  the\r\n\r\nform of loans which will have to be repaid, then the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories will have to take care to  spend\r\n\r\nit  wisely  on projects that will yield a return  to\r\n\r\nenable  them to refund the loan. From our  point  of\r\n\r\nview, we will get our capital back at the end of the\r\n\r\nperiod of the loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, we have attached a condition to this\r\n\r\nloan,  and  that  is that half the  labour  used  in\r\n\r\nconstruction  projects - and they  will  be  used  in\r\n\r\nconstruction  projects in developing the  States  in\r\n\r\nBorneo - must come from Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown then refers to a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  item in the Nanyang Siang Pau  yesterday.\r\n\r\nHe  says  that that amounted to a complete rejection\r\n\r\nby  the  Federation Government of this condition.  I\r\n\r\nhave seen this particular newspaper item. May I  say\r\n\r\nthat, in the first instance, it is not issued as  an\r\n\r\nofficial Press release of the Federation Government?\r\n\r\nIt  only says that it comes from Government sources,\r\n\r\nunspecified.  It is a leakage of some  sort,  and  I\r\n\r\nhave  a  shrewd  guess how it  came  about.  We  are\r\n\r\naccustomed to this kind of exchange with  a  certain\r\n\r\nParty in Singapore and ourselves, and I think we  in\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have  not done too badly  out  of  this\r\n\r\nencounter. No, Sir, the terms will be observed. Mind\r\n\r\nyou,  Mr Speaker, I am not saying that we  want  to\r\n\r\nforce  this loan on the Borneo territories. If  they\r\n\r\ndo not like our labourers and our money, we will not\r\n\r\ncompel them to borrow from us. Now that condition is\r\n\r\nobviously  not an unreasonable condition. In  inter-Government loans, it is the normal practice that the\r\n\r\nmoney  must be spent in some way whereby the lending\r\n\r\ncountry  derives  some benefits.  Now,  the  Members\r\n\r\nopposite  claim that we have agreed to an  interest-free  loan  for ten years. The Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nsaid  it and it was re-echoed by the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim which, in itself, means that whenever the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong Lim re-echoes some statements, surely  the\r\n\r\nfirst  reaction of any reasonable man is to suspect,\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is  a  great  rumour-monger,  a   great\r\n\r\npurveyor  of untruths. \"Ten-year interest free,\"  is\r\n\r\nwhat  he  said.  I do not see this anywhere  in  the\r\n\r\nAgreement. The Agreement says\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest   free  for  five  years  and  if  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion and prosperity in Singapore justifies  it,\r\n\r\nthen  a  further five years. If there should be  any\r\n\r\ndispute as to whether justification exists for  this\r\n\r\nextension,  then the matter will be referred  to  an\r\n\r\nindependent  assessor appointed by the  World  Bank.\r\n\r\nFair  enough. If we prosper as a result of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nto  such  an  extent as to justify an  extension  of\r\n\r\nanother  five years, why should we worry  about  it?\r\n\r\nAnd  further  this  provides an  inducement  to  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Government not only to abstain from  taking\r\n\r\nmeasures  harmful to our prosperity but to also  act\r\n\r\nas  a positive inducement for them to take steps  to\r\n\r\nincrease our prosperity. And again, this is  not  an\r\n\r\nunreasonable condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown asks a particularly\r\n\r\nfoolish  question. He wants to know why  we  do  not\r\n\r\nimpose  World  Bank terms on the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\nThe answer is quite simple, Mr Speaker, Sir. We are\r\n\r\nnot the World Bank and our relations with the Borneo\r\n\r\nStates  and the Federal Government are not the  same\r\n\r\nas  the  relations between the World  Bank  and  the\r\n\r\nborrowing  countries.  But in this  connection,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown repeats the falsehood  which\r\n\r\nhas  been refuted in the past, namely, the falsehood\r\n\r\nthat  the  World Bank terms on the loan to Singapore\r\n\r\nare  humiliating. He knows that this is  untrue;  he\r\n\r\nknows  that we have already pointed out to him  that\r\n\r\nthese terms are the standard terms applicable to all\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank loans and are observed by each and every\r\n\r\ncountry borrowing money from the World Bank,  be  it\r\n\r\nan    under-developed   country   or   an   advanced\r\n\r\nindustrialised  nation. Does  he  think  that  these\r\n\r\nterms  are  humiliating then? Does he maintain  that\r\n\r\nthe World Bank is bent on humiliating each and every\r\n\r\ncountry in the world which qualifies to borrow  from\r\n\r\nthe World Bank?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on another aspect of the loan, namely, the\r\n\r\ncost  of  the loan. The fact that we give  the  loan\r\n\r\ninterest free for five years - how much does it  cost\r\n\r\nto  the State of Singapore? He says it will cost  us\r\n\r\n$110  million. He assumes it is $55 million, 5\u00bd  per\r\n\r\ncent  interest on $100 million for ten years  equals\r\n\r\n$55 million. Then he says that we have to borrow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother  $100 million and pay interest on it,  which\r\n\r\nwill cost us another $55 million, and that therefore\r\n\r\nif  you  add the two sums together, it will cost  us\r\n\r\n$110  million. Sir, this kind of Barisan  arithmetic\r\n\r\npasses my comprehension. I cannot understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> You can ask an\r\n\r\naccountant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I cannot understand. We have\r\n\r\nanother Barisan mathematician, Mr Speaker, Sir. Can\r\n\r\nI  reduce  this  to  simple plain  terms  which  are\r\n\r\ncomprehensible   even  to  the   meanest   intellect\r\n\r\nopposite? Let us speak in easy terms. If I  were  to\r\n\r\nlend  you  a  shirt, let us say  for  five  days - of\r\n\r\ncourse,  not for five years - and then I am short  of\r\n\r\none shirt and so I go to High Street and buy another\r\n\r\nshirt  to  replace  it.  Now, according  to  Barisan\r\n\r\ncalculations,  I  would have lost  two  shirts  - the\r\n\r\nshirt  which  I  lent to you and the shirt  which  I\r\n\r\nbought. It is this kind of curious logic repeated by\r\n\r\nmy    former   Parliamentary   Secretary   obviously\r\n\r\nbelieving his Chairman - the man noted for a complete\r\n\r\nabsence  of reason and logic.

The Federal Government says that  Income\r\n\r\nTax  and  Customs are Federal revenues,  that  these\r\n\r\ndepartments should be under their direct control and\r\n\r\nthat  the  whole  staff should be employees  of  the\r\n\r\nFederal Government. Our contention is that the terms\r\n\r\nof the White Paper are quite explicit and that these\r\n\r\ndepartments  will  remain under  the  administrative\r\n\r\ncontrol of the Singapore Government. And so  it  was\r\n\r\nin  the  London Agreement that these two departments\r\n\r\nremain   under   the   control  of   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  would have thought that  this  would\r\n\r\nhave  satisfied  the Members of the Opposition,  but\r\n\r\nneedless  to say the Member for Queenstown  was  not\r\n\r\nsatisfied.  His principal contention is  this,  that\r\n\r\nalthough authority has been delegated under  Article\r\n\r\n84   of   the  Federal  Constitution,  the   Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment can revoke this authority any  time  they\r\n\r\nlike. I quote him from page 69 of Hansard [unrevised\r\n\r\ntranscript]  Vol. 21, No. 5, dated 30th  July,  1963\r\n\r\n(col. 396). He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore can collect the revenue only at the\r\n\r\npleasure  of the Federation Government.  If  at  any\r\n\r\ntime the Federation Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfeels  so  inclined, it can take over the collection\r\n\r\nof   all   Federal  revenue  itself.  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment collects only if the Federation allows it\r\n\r\nto collect.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  this is a complete travesty of the truth.  The\r\n\r\nFederal  Government can revoke this  authority  only\r\n\r\nunder  two  circumstances: first, if  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment agrees to such revocation and,  secondly,\r\n\r\nif  the Singapore Government fails to collect  taxes\r\n\r\nin a proper and efficient manner, and this fact must\r\n\r\nhe  established in a court of law if  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment disputes that it has failed in  its  duty\r\n\r\nof  efficient  tax collection. Surely, Members  will\r\n\r\nagree  that  if  sonic  future Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nbungles its tax collection either through corruption\r\n\r\nor   ineptitude,   and  if  this  failure   can   be\r\n\r\nestablished in the High Court, then it is only right\r\n\r\nand  proper  that the Federal Government takes  over\r\n\r\nthis  department. There is nothing wrong or sinister\r\n\r\nin this provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have dwelt at some length in replying to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson on the misrepresentations which\r\n\r\nhe  has made on the subject of the Common Market and\r\n\r\nmuch  of  what I have said will apply to the remarks\r\n\r\nof the Members for Queenstown and Hong Lim when they\r\n\r\nput  forward their criticisms of the Common  Market.\r\n\r\nThey  complain  that  the Common  Market  means  the\r\n\r\nabandonment of the free port status of Singapore.  I\r\n\r\nhave explained how, under the Common Market, special\r\n\r\ntechniques  are  possible and  special  arrangements\r\n\r\nwill be made to make possible the re-export trade of\r\n\r\nSingapore   in  manufactured  goods.  I  have   also\r\n\r\nexplained that in respect of tropical produce, which\r\n\r\nforms the bulk of our entrepot trade, nothing in the\r\n\r\nCommon Market arrangements will affect this entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  in  the slightest degree. So the unfavourable\r\n\r\nrepercussion  of the Common Market on  the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade   is   largely  a  matter  of   their   biased\r\n\r\nimagination.  But  I  will say this,  that  if  some\r\n\r\nincompetent   or  corrupt  Government   takes   over\r\n\r\nSingapore in the near future and has not the ability\r\n\r\nto  phase  the Common Market arrangements in  a  way\r\n\r\nthat  will  properly  balance  industrial  interests\r\n\r\nagainst  the interests of the trade, then  it  could\r\n\r\nhappen  that  not  only trade will suffer  but  also\r\n\r\nindustry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  suffer. But given an intelligent and effective\r\n\r\nimplementation  of the Common Market proposals,  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  effect in Singapore must be to accelerate\r\n\r\nthe  growth  of  industries  and  the  expansion  of\r\n\r\nemployment  opportunities.  In  fact,  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoday,  in anticipation of the Common Market,  there\r\n\r\nhas  been  a spurt of industrial propositions  here,\r\n\r\nand   very  shortly  I  shall  be  awarding  Pioneer\r\n\r\nCertificates  to 30 firms. These are  all  proposals\r\n\r\ndeveloped  in  recent months to set up factories  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in anticipation of the common market,  and\r\n\r\nthe  number of Pioneer Certificates involved in this\r\n\r\nexercise  - some 30 - is nearly as large as the  total\r\n\r\nnumber of Pioneer Certificates which we have awarded\r\n\r\nin   the   first   3\u00bd  years  in  our   efforts   to\r\n\r\nindustrialise. In the first 3\u00bd years, the number  of\r\n\r\npioneer  firms  receiving certificates  amounted  to\r\n\r\nonly  42, and only in the last four or five  months,\r\n\r\n30  new  firms came with solid proposals on feasible\r\n\r\nindustrial  ventures which will  be  established  in\r\n\r\nSingapore before very long. Unquestionably after the\r\n\r\nestablishment of Malaysia and the Common Market,  we\r\n\r\nshall  see  an  even faster rate of growth.  Do  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis and other Opposition Members object\r\n\r\nto the growth of new industries to provide more jobs\r\n\r\nand  more  income, or are they in favour of mounting\r\n\r\nunemployment and endemic misery and hopelessness?  I\r\n\r\nhave no doubt that the Communist mentors behind  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis do not want to see economic  growth\r\n\r\nand   prosperity  for  our  State,  for  with   more\r\n\r\nprosperity,   more  jobs  and  more  income,   their\r\n\r\ncapacity  to instigate trouble diminishes.  But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  can hardly be expected  to  oblige  the\r\n\r\nCommunists in this respect and the gnashing of teeth\r\n\r\nand  the shedding of crocodile tears over the Common\r\n\r\nMarket by the Barisan Sosialis reflect no more  than\r\n\r\nthe chagrin which their masters must be feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to deal with some observations made by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Hong Lim in regard to loans. He  has\r\n\r\nproved  to  be even more mendacious than the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown. He claims\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  will  hardly get  any  benefits  by\r\n\r\nsupplying labour to the Borneo States. At page 54 of\r\n\r\nyesterday's Hansard [Unrevised transcript] Vol.  21,\r\n\r\nNo. 6 (col. 503), he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the $150 million loan is used in the Borneo\r\n\r\nStates  and  even if they recruit some  labour  from\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it  will  only  engage  [and  these  are\r\n\r\nimportant words, Sir] 30, 50 or, let us say, 500  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  labourers; take away 500 of Singapore's\r\n\r\nunemployed labourers at a cost of $50 million.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We  do not accept this figure of 50 nor do we accept\r\n\r\nthe  figure of even 500. What are the facts? I  have\r\n\r\nmade  inquiries from the Drainage and Road Engineers\r\n\r\nof  the P.W.D. and from the Architects and Engineers\r\n\r\nof  the Housing Board and the estimate they gave  me\r\n\r\nis  this,  that for every million dollars  worth  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  the following number of jobs  will  be\r\n\r\ncreated  for  one year. A million dollars  worth  of\r\n\r\nroads will require 500 workers for a year; a million\r\n\r\ndollars  worth of drainage, 350 workers;  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars  worth of housing, 270 workers.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  how the Borneo territories will spend on their\r\n\r\ndevelopment  schemes as between these three  classes\r\n\r\nof  expenditure or whether there will be other types\r\n\r\nof   expenditure.  But  let  us  suppose  that  they\r\n\r\ndistribute the expenditure equally over these  three\r\n\r\ncategories. This will mean that for every $3 million\r\n\r\nspent each year, they will require a labour force of\r\n\r\n1,120 of whom half must come from Singapore and this\r\n\r\n$3  million gives us 560 men working for  one  year.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if they spend $30 million a year,  which\r\n\r\nis  the $150 million loan for five years, this  will\r\n\r\ngive  total  employment to some 11,200  workers,  of\r\n\r\nwhom half or 5,600 workers will come from Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  say that this will make substantial inroads  into\r\n\r\nour unemployment figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 55 (col. 504), the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nentered   into  some  truly  absurd  and   fantastic\r\n\r\ncalculations the details of which he has  not  given\r\n\r\nto  the Assembly. He states that while Singapore  is\r\n\r\ncontributing  large sums to the Central  Government,\r\n\r\nthe Borneo States will get some $200 million a year.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  have had the Borneo Constitutional  reports\r\n\r\nand documents studied by my officials\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto check on the accuracy of this assertion, and they\r\n\r\ncan  find  nothing in any document to say  that  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Government will be giving  each  year  $200\r\n\r\nmillion to the Borneo States. On the other hand,  my\r\n\r\ninformation  from  the  calculations  made   by   my\r\n\r\nofficers  is  that the Borneo territories  of  North\r\n\r\nBorneo and Sarawak have an annual tax yield of  $150\r\n\r\nmillion  a  year,  and of this  amount  the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment will take over two-thirds of $92  million\r\n\r\nin return for which they will pay $20 million by way\r\n\r\nof  capitation and road grants. Sarawak will qualify\r\n\r\nfor some grants depending among other factors on how\r\n\r\nlarge  the deficit is, hut the total amount  is  not\r\n\r\nstated.  Certainly to say the Borneo States will  be\r\n\r\ngetting $200 million a year while we will be paying\r\n\r\nthe  Federation $100 million a year  is  a  complete\r\n\r\nprevarication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small point about the production tax was raised\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Queenstown. He says that  if  it\r\n\r\ncosts us $1 to make a pair of shoes in Singapore and\r\n\r\n$1.50  in  the Federation, then the Singapore  firms\r\n\r\nwill be taxed 50 cents a pair to equalise the costs.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  there will be a production tax  on  eggs\r\n\r\nbecause we produce eggs cheaper than the Federation.\r\n\r\nSir,  this is Litter and unqualified drivel.  May  I\r\n\r\nrefer  to Annex J, Article 1 (3)  (a)  which describes\r\n\r\nthe  production tax as a tax on produce  in  a  low-tariff  State  which will offset  the  costs  - since\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  typing error in my text, I had  better\r\n\r\nrefer  to  Annex I, Article I (3)  (a)  on  production\r\n\r\ntax:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... tax on producers in a low-tariff State which\r\n\r\nwould offset the cost inequalities arising from  the\r\n\r\ndifferential import duties.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, it is only where the import  duties\r\n\r\nare different then there will be a production tax to\r\n\r\nequalise  this  difference in the costs.  Where  the\r\n\r\ndifference  in  costs is due to other reasons,  like\r\n\r\nthe  differences in types of machines  used,  better\r\n\r\nmanagement,  cheaper labour or what have  you,  then\r\n\r\nthe production tax will not apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one point I want to underline in\r\n\r\nregard to these financial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrangements. The money we are paying to the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment,  now agreed at 40 per cent  of  national\r\n\r\ntaxes  collected in Singapore, is not a  gift  or  a\r\n\r\ngrant.  Some political Parties are deliberately  and\r\n\r\ndishonestly trying to misrepresent this contribution\r\n\r\nas  a  free  gift. It is abundantly clear  from  the\r\n\r\ndocument  in  Misc. 4 of 1963 that the  calculations\r\n\r\nhave  regard  to  the  cost  of  running  Federation\r\n\r\ndepartments in Singapore and the cost of certain Pan-Malaysian   services  such  as   Defence,   External\r\n\r\nAffairs,  Parliament  and other  matters  for  which\r\n\r\nSingapore  should reasonably make a contribution.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the Member for Anson has  suggested\r\n\r\nthat  the people have been crucified and that  their\r\n\r\npockets are then picked - this is his description  of\r\n\r\nthe  contribution. I think this is one of  the  most\r\n\r\nfatuous statements made by the Member for Anson, who\r\n\r\nhas made many of them in this House. But all Members\r\n\r\nof   the  Opposition  have  conveniently  overlooked\r\n\r\nparagraph  8  of  Annex J. This  provides  that  the\r\n\r\nfinancial arrangements shall be reviewed at the  end\r\n\r\nof   1964  and  every  two  years  thereafter.   The\r\n\r\nagreement should be first by negotiation between the\r\n\r\ntwo  Governments,  and if they  cannot  come  to  an\r\n\r\nagreement,  then an independent assessor recommended\r\n\r\nby  the  World Bank shall consider the position  and\r\n\r\nmake  recommendations which will be binding on  both\r\n\r\nGovernments.  Surely, the Member for  Anson  is  not\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that the World Bank will participate  as\r\n\r\nan accessory in the act of pick-pocketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said a moment ago, our contribution is\r\n\r\nnot  a  free gift. In fact, about three-quarters  of\r\n\r\nthe  money we will be paying to the Federation after\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  already being spent  in  Singapore  on\r\n\r\nservices provided by the Singapore Government.  This\r\n\r\nrepresents payments which we are actually making now\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  departments such as the  Police,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Infantry  Regiment,  the  Prisons,   the\r\n\r\nJudiciary,  the  Immigration Department,  the  Civil\r\n\r\nAviation  Department,  the Audit  Office  and  other\r\n\r\ndepartments which will be transferred to the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter  31st August this year. The remaining  quarter\r\n\r\nrepresents  mainly the increased  costs  of  Defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure   consequent   on   confrontation    and\r\n\r\nMalaysia. There should be no difficulty in  arriving\r\n\r\nat  the  proper costs of running Federal departments\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, and in the review made at the end  of\r\n\r\n1964,  we shall know whether or not the Armed Forces\r\n\r\nand   the   Police  maintained  by   the   Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  all territories will  have  achieved\r\n\r\ntheir  planned rate of growth. If they do not,  then\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  changes  in future  percentages  of\r\n\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will end up on some observations about our\r\n\r\nrate of industrial growth both at the present moment\r\n\r\nand  our  prospective rates after the Common Market.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Anson has scoffed at our  prospects\r\n\r\nand  present  position of industrial expansion.  But\r\n\r\nmay I quote briefly from a document published by the\r\n\r\nEconomic Intelligence Unit. This organisation  makes\r\n\r\nregular studies and economic reviews of every region\r\n\r\nin  the  world and publishes for private circulation\r\n\r\nquarterly reports available to subscribers.  I  wish\r\n\r\nto  quote from page 42 of No. 42 of the Review dated\r\n\r\nJune 1963. It says here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In recent months Singapore has received greater\r\n\r\ninternational attention. Apart from the advantage of\r\n\r\nconstituting  the  business centre  for  the  coming\r\n\r\nFederation  and the incentive provided by  its  free\r\n\r\nport status even when modified, Singapore's industry\r\n\r\ndraws  further investment through its concentration.\r\n\r\nThe  instability of the Island's political situation\r\n\r\nand  its  poor  industrial relation have  failed  to\r\n\r\noffset the very real advantages which Singapore  can\r\n\r\noffer.  The Economic Development Board is  extremely\r\n\r\nefficient.  Singapore spends ten times  as  much  on\r\n\r\npromotion as does the Federation. Overheads are  low\r\n\r\nin  Singapore; discharging costs are more  expensive\r\n\r\nat  Port  Swettenham. It is significant that whereas\r\n\r\npresent  estimate  construction  of  1,800  feet  of\r\n\r\nberthing space in Port Swettenham costs $14 million,\r\n\r\n5,000  feet at what will be one of the largest  bulk\r\n\r\nhandling  harbours in Asia - Jurong - will  cost  only\r\n\r\n$14 million.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This is the point:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore has in fact reached a stage where it is\r\n\r\nlikely to attract new industries more regularly than\r\n\r\nHongkong,  let  alone Selangor and  Perak.  Although\r\n\r\nwage  levels  for unskilled labour are substantially\r\n\r\nhigher  than Hongkong, the differential  is  not  so\r\n\r\ngreat in wage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  skilled labour. Moreover, Singapore  can  offer\r\n\r\nindustrial  land at one-tenth the cost of  Hongkong.\r\n\r\nAbundant  water  supply, port facilities  which  are\r\n\r\nunlikely  to  be affected by silting and  land  free\r\n\r\nfrom speculators and squatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these conditions and particularly in view of\r\n\r\nits  credit  worthy status, that is,  credit  worthy\r\n\r\nstatus  established by the World Bank, the prospects\r\n\r\nfor Singapore's industry looks bright.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  Sir, this was written before the agreement  on\r\n\r\nthe  Common Market, and I am certain that  with  the\r\n\r\nadditional  impetus provided by the  Common  Market,\r\n\r\nSingapore will be an even more attractive centre  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  investment. I am hopeful that  we  shall\r\n\r\nsee  an  unprecedented rate of industrial growth  in\r\n\r\nthe  next five years. But this is conditional on one\r\n\r\nfactor,  that is, the future government of Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  maintain  the high standards of integrity  and\r\n\r\ncontinue  the effective economic policies which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government has initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when we\r\n\r\ntook office in 1959 there was no lack of prophets of\r\n\r\ndoom.  The  Member  for Tanglin,  who  is  curiously\r\n\r\nsilent  in  this debate, was all the time  bemoaning\r\n\r\nthe   flight   of   capital  from   Singapore,   the\r\n\r\ncontraction   of  business  and  the  imminence   of\r\n\r\neconomic  collapse. Today nobody thinks along  these\r\n\r\nterms other than the irresponsible Opposition of the\r\n\r\npro-Communist Left, whose contact with  reality  has\r\n\r\nalways  been tenuous, whose capacity for reason  and\r\n\r\nlogic  is  infantile, and whose regard for truth  is\r\n\r\nnon-existent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will press on regardless of the futile\r\n\r\nand  now pathetic efforts of the anti-national  Left\r\n\r\nto  pull  the country down. After Malaysia  and  the\r\n\r\nCommon  Market, I see a bright future for our people\r\n\r\nand  our  country - a future in which each and  every\r\n\r\none  of  us will have a fair opportunity to  develop\r\n\r\nour talents to the full and to make our contribution\r\n\r\nfor the prosperity of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, in debating the motion in the name  of\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  on  the  subject  of  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement  and financial arrangements,  I  will  not\r\n\r\ntake long because I merely wish to clarify the stand\r\n\r\nof  the  Alliance Members in this Assembly. Although\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Farrer  Park  has  submitted   an\r\n\r\namendment to this motion, the newspapers,  I  regret\r\n\r\nto  say,  have twisted all the facts that have  been\r\n\r\nstated  in  this Chamber. Except for the Member  for\r\n\r\nJoo  Chiat,  the  stand of the Alliance  Members  on\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  clear and has been  explained  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Farrer Park. Since this problem was  put\r\n\r\nforward in the Assembly, we have supported it  right\r\n\r\nfrom the beginning until the referendum was held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twists and turns of the P.A.P. in their\r\n\r\nattempt  to  divide  U.M.N.O.

We are representing the\r\n\r\nAlliance in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to the amendment brought up by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer Park, which has been brought up  not  in\r\n\r\nthe  interests of party politics hut with foresight,\r\n\r\nand  which will determine the destiny of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, as different from the tactics adopted\r\n\r\nby  the  Government on the question of the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nAgreement   in  which  is  contained  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution. The Singapore Constitution belongs  to\r\n\r\nall  the people of Singapore, and is not merely  the\r\n\r\nproperty of the P.A.P. Government. Because it is the\r\n\r\nproperty of the people of Singapore, we are  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion  - and I personally, Mr Speaker, although  I\r\n\r\nam  new to parliamentary practice, I must say it  is\r\n\r\nclear  to  me  I  see the dangers arising  from  the\r\n\r\namendments which have been inserted and as contained\r\n\r\nin  the  Blue Book issued in England. In the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom   edition,  the  first   amendment   is   in\r\n\r\nconnection  with the tenure of office of Assemblymen\r\n\r\nand  it  does  not  state that if a  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly resigns or is expelled from the Party, then\r\n\r\nhis  seat automatically becomes vacant. We  ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to explain in which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstitution    in    countries    which    practise\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy are party matters  inserted.\r\n\r\nWe have only heard a reply from the Minister for Law\r\n\r\nthat  this  state of affairs exists in  France,  and\r\n\r\nalthough it is true, the method of election is  that\r\n\r\nof  the continental system on a party basis. I think\r\n\r\nthat  explanation is reasonable. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nwe have witnessed the Cabinet changes in France. The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of the Cabinet holds office for  even\r\n\r\nless  than  one  month.  This  is  proof  that   the\r\n\r\namendment is justified. This, the Government claims,\r\n\r\nis an effort to find a stable and strong government.\r\n\r\nIf  this amendment is carried and enshrined  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  Singapore Constitution, I can  foresee  evil\r\n\r\nconsequences.  We  have seen  Members  crossing  the\r\n\r\nFloor,  as has been done by the Member for Aljunied.\r\n\r\nNow  we are faced with the practice of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  If  we  like  to  follow  the  model  in\r\n\r\nEngland, we know that the Government Back benches do\r\n\r\ncriticise  their  own Government, because  the  Back\r\n\r\nbenches are given an opportunity to criticise  their\r\n\r\nown  Government  if it is considered  that  national\r\n\r\nmatters  are  more  important  than  party  matters.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  we  of  the Alliance. On  this  problem,\r\n\r\nalthough  it  has  been  said  that  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment has given its consent, we have moved this\r\n\r\namendment with a full sense of responsibility to the\r\n\r\nState  of  Singapore. We object to the insertion  of\r\n\r\nthis  particular  clause in  the  Assembly.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is unable to accept our amendment, and in\r\n\r\nview of the fact that it is an important matter  and\r\n\r\nwe   desire  to  uphold  democratic  principles   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we are prepared to face the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, secondly, the question of the Singapore Constitution which can be amended conveniently. Only the Government can amend the Constitution. The Constitution is very loose; it has no value at all. We know that to uphold democratic\r\n\r\nprinciples, an amendment to the constitution must be\r\n\r\ngiven  careful  consideration. If we can  amend  the\r\n\r\nconstitution easily, the consequences will  be  very\r\n\r\nbad  indeed. Therefore, we demand that every article\r\n\r\nin the Constitution to be amended must receive a two-thirds majority vote. This is normal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparliamentary practice. I cannot understand why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wishes to make the clause  so  loose.  I\r\n\r\nthink it has its own reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, on the question of filling of vacancies\r\n\r\nin  the  Assembly.  It should be  enshrined  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  If  it  is  not  emphasised  in   the\r\n\r\nConstitution  - we have seen examples  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbecause of the absence of a particular clause  which\r\n\r\nbinds the Government; although we may try to put the\r\n\r\nblame   on  the  previous  Government,  it  is   our\r\n\r\nresponsibility   today,   when   we   discover   the\r\n\r\nweaknesses,  to  rectify  the  errors.  Should   any\r\n\r\nvacancy occur in future, we do not wish to leave  it\r\n\r\nto  the  whims  and fancies of the Party  in  power.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if the Government is unwilling to  accept\r\n\r\nthe amendment moved by the Alliance of Singapore, we\r\n\r\nwill  be  forced to be a party to the  mistakes  and\r\n\r\nerrors  perpetrated by the Government, to  sign  the\r\n\r\nagreement  which they claim has been  agreed  to  by\r\n\r\nthree  parties  on  the  subject  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider this matter affects the destiny of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. I think I have clarified  our\r\n\r\nstand  on this matter which, as I have said earlier,\r\n\r\nhas been twisted and turned by the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in connection with the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  reaching an agreement with  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  recover  War  Department  lands   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I welcome the action taken  because  the\r\n\r\npoint has, in fact, been raised that we are short of\r\n\r\nland  in Singapore. In connection with Blakang Mati,\r\n\r\nwhich  will be the main concentration of development\r\n\r\nin  Singapore in future, as the Malay proverb  goes:\r\n\r\n\"We  do  not  wish  to  have the  incident  repeated\r\n\r\ntwice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given my co-operation to the Government\r\n\r\nregardless  of  party  politics  or  otherwise.  The\r\n\r\nisland   of  Samulun  has  been  acquired   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for development by Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  for  the purposes of putting up factories.  I\r\n\r\nhave given my fullest co-operation and has, in fact,\r\n\r\nwritten  to the Economic Development Board  so  that\r\n\r\nthe islanders affected will be given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuitable   alternative  accommodation.  After   much\r\n\r\npersuasion  the  islanders have  agreed  to  be  re-settled  in a nearby island. But what has  happened?\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  Chairman of the E.D.B. has  given  an\r\n\r\nassurance  that I will be notified of  developments,\r\n\r\ntoday  - I  wrote the letter on 27th September,  1962\r\n\r\n- suddenly  without  my knowledge  summonses  by  the\r\n\r\ncourt  have  been issued to the islanders  demanding\r\n\r\nthat they quit because they are considered to be  in\r\n\r\nillegal occupation of State land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given my co-operation to the Government,\r\n\r\nbut in return I cannot agree with, in fact, I object\r\n\r\nto the action taken by the Government. I do not wish\r\n\r\nthis  to happen to the residents at Blakang Mati.  I\r\n\r\nknow the Government is giving full consideration  to\r\n\r\nthe  development of Blakang Mati, and I hope it will\r\n\r\ngive serious consideration in the future. These  are\r\n\r\nthe two points I wish to raise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me give a reply\r\n\r\nto  the Minister for Finance. He talked about yearly\r\n\r\ncontributions. He said that the Barisan Sosialis, in\r\n\r\ncalculating  the contribution made by  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federal  Parliament,  is  wrong  in  two  ways.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the $124 million is 40 per cent  plus  $36\r\n\r\nmillion. He made the first mistake that it should be\r\n\r\ncapital   expenditure,  whereas  we  treat   it   as\r\n\r\nrecurrent expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in fact, in regard to this question, we have not made any mistake at all.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member detach his ear-piece\r\n\r\nfrom  the  microphone?

That was when Mr Tan Siew  Sin\r\n\r\nhad  returned from London. He said in Singapore that\r\n\r\nof  the Federal taxes collected in Singapore, 40 per\r\n\r\ncent would be given to the Federal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In  addition to this,  Singapore  would\r\n\r\nalso  have to shoulder its Inland Revenue,  Customs,\r\n\r\nExcise,  Broadcasting  and Administrative  expenses.\r\n\r\nThis  expenditure is a recurrent one. In  regard  to\r\n\r\ninternal   security,   defence   and   other   major\r\n\r\nexpenditure. Singapore would also be responsible for\r\n\r\ntheir contributions. He also said further that  this\r\n\r\nburden  did not include the 40 per cent taxes  which\r\n\r\nSingapore   would  have  to  give  to  the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us assume that the figures were not recurrent\r\n\r\nbut  capital expenditure. Have we been wrong in this\r\n\r\ncalculation?  No,  we have not been  wrong,  because\r\n\r\nMisc. Paper 4 of 1963 - Document No. V UI, the fourth\r\n\r\nparagraph. This is a letter written by the Tunku  to\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister. It says (Mr Chan Sun Wing spoke\r\n\r\nin English) -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member now suddenly switches\r\n\r\non  to  English.  If  he wishes to  quote  from  the\r\n\r\ndocument  in  English,  he  must  paraphrase  it  in\r\n\r\nMandarin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was quoting\r\n\r\nDocument  No. VIII. The fourth paragraph  says  that\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government will pay to  the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment  the  cost  of  capital  development   of\r\n\r\nFederal  projects in Singapore other  than  projects\r\n\r\nfor Defence and Internal Security. In this paragraph\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku does not say that this is included in the\r\n\r\n40  per cent taxes. Therefore, it is clear. But  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance says that we have included this\r\n\r\namount  of expenditure into the 40 per cent. Who  is\r\n\r\nwrong  after  all? I think the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nhimself is wrong. Here we should also like to  point\r\n\r\nout  that  the  amount Singapore  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nresponsible for is not only this: there is more than\r\n\r\nthis,   because  according  to  Misc.  4  of   1963,\r\n\r\nparagraph 51 at page 19, we know that the difference\r\n\r\nin  the amount Singapore will have to contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo  territories - in this  respect  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill have to lose $4 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the question of the profits of the Currency\r\n\r\nBoard,  on  page  49, apportionment. Singapore  will\r\n\r\nalso have to lose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother  $10 million. Therefore, under this sort  of\r\n\r\nmerger  arrangement, the losses  of  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore far exceed 40 per cent. In other words, in\r\n\r\naddition to the 40 per cent contribution, we have to\r\n\r\nincur various kinds of losses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the loans and the 50 per cent of\r\n\r\nlabour mentioned by the Minister for Finance. If  we\r\n\r\nwere  to  go  according to the  calculation  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister, then every year in North Borneo $3 million\r\n\r\ninvestment could provide jobs for 1,120 workers.  If\r\n\r\nwe were to go according to a $30 million investment,\r\n\r\nto  make  the calculation, then in the future  three\r\n\r\nyears,   the  same  amount  of  money  invested   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  bring  out  11,200  jobs.  Can  it\r\n\r\nresolve our unemployment situation here? Is  it  not\r\n\r\nimportant  to  resolve Singapore's own  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nis  this. He said that the Barisan Sosialis, on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of military expenditure, has been adopting\r\n\r\ncontradictory views. He said, on the  one  hand,  we\r\n\r\ncriticise  the increase of military expenditure.  On\r\n\r\nthe other hand, we oppose the Mutual Defence Treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this question, the Barisan Sosialis stand is\r\n\r\nnot  contradictory at all - our views  on  these  two\r\n\r\nitems   are   not  contradictory.  If  the   Malayan\r\n\r\nGovernment or the Malaysia Government adopts a  good\r\n\r\nneighbourly policy in foreign affairs, then it  will\r\n\r\nnot  have  to  incur  this  great  sum  of  military\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  This  expenditure has  been  necessary\r\n\r\nbecause  of the foreign policy of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, which involves the Federation in a cold war.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, we cannot forget that Indonesia is\r\n\r\nstill suspicious of Malaysia. This is because Malaya\r\n\r\nhas  been used by Britain and America as a base  for\r\n\r\nsubversive  activities against  Indonesia,  and  the\r\n\r\npresent  Malayan Government is still closely  allied\r\n\r\nwith Britain and the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the Government of Malaya adopts a neutral\r\n\r\nstand  and a non-alignment policy and take the  side\r\n\r\nof  the Afro-Asian countries, the expenditure in the\r\n\r\nmilitary field will be increasing - not to talk about\r\n\r\nthe fact that a country like Malaya is unable to  be\r\n\r\nan instrument in a Western cold war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth point, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\ncriticised  us.  He said that the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ndoes   not  want  industrialisation.  This  is  also\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  facts. According to what the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  has said a little while ago,  the  so-called   Common  Market  and  industrialisation   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  mean only the establishment  of  assembly\r\n\r\nplants,  enabling foreign capitalists to send  their\r\n\r\nhalf-finished products to be assembled in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  will  be  detrimental to the establishment  of\r\n\r\nindustries  in  a half-developed country,  and  will\r\n\r\nonly  be contributing to a new method to enable  the\r\n\r\ncapitalists and colonialist countries to continue to\r\n\r\nexploit  Singapore. There will be no change  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic situation at all here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what the Prime Minister has said, that\r\n\r\nBritain  has persuaded the Federation Government  to\r\n\r\ninclude  the  terms of the Common  Market  into  the\r\n\r\nConstitution, we can see that the Common Market  and\r\n\r\nthe  industrialisation plan will not  alter  British\r\n\r\nbenefits here. If so, they would not have agreed  to\r\n\r\nsuch terms being included.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will briefly reply to what the Minister for Culture said yesterday. Yesterday evening between 8.15 and 8.30 p.m. the Minister for Culture mentioned 59 times the word \"Communist\". According to today's Nanyang Siang Pau, in which is printed his speech, in about 30 paragraphs he used\r\n\r\n107  times  the word \"Communist\". From this  we  can\r\n\r\njudge that if we were to cancel the word \"Communist\"\r\n\r\nfrom  the  dictionary of the Minister  for  Culture,\r\n\r\nthen  he  will  not be in a position  to  write  any\r\n\r\narticle at all. I would not like to spend more  time\r\n\r\non  this  kind of Minister who is suffering  from  a\r\n\r\nCommunist phobia. But I would like to reply in a few\r\n\r\nwords  to  what he said when he brought  out  a  few\r\n\r\nphotographs in this Assembly yesterday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will remember that he said that the Singapore National Construction Workers Union deliberately wanted to disturb the Prime Minister. Whether or not the Prime Minister had been there on a visit, this Union had its own loudspeakers, because they had been going according to the directions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Registrar of Societies in  convening  their\r\n\r\nannual  members' conference at their  premises.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  also  commented on  the  lighting  of  the\r\n\r\npremises of this Union suddenly going off.  But,  in\r\n\r\nactual  fact,  the  lighting normally  goes  off  at\r\n\r\nexactly  the time mentioned by the Minister, because\r\n\r\nthey normally go home to sleep at roughly that time.\r\n\r\nYet  our Prime Minister described it as his victory.\r\n\r\nThis sort of victory can be described as Ah Q's type\r\n\r\nof victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Prime Minister has returned, let me\r\n\r\nreply  briefly to what he has said. In  moving  this\r\n\r\nmotion,  he  seems  to  be  deliberately  describing\r\n\r\nhimself as a great personage, as though without  him\r\n\r\nthere  will be no Malaysia. According to the Nanyang\r\n\r\nSiang  Pau  of 31st July - there is a report  on  his\r\n\r\nspeech  - he said, \"I spent about two years  to  make\r\n\r\nthe British Government believe that if Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Malaya were not brought together,\r\n\r\nthe  British would lose the two territories. In  the\r\n\r\nend  the  British  were made to  believe  that  this\r\n\r\nanalysis  was  correct.\"  The  Prime  Minister   has\r\n\r\nexaggerated: he has been bragging too  much.  If  we\r\n\r\nrefer  to  the report, the first sentence says  that\r\n\r\nthe   concept   of  the  coming  together   of   the\r\n\r\nterritories of Singapore, Borneo, Sarawak and Malaya\r\n\r\nhas  been discussed for many years. Could it be  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  or could it be  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  who  has  brought about Malaysia,  who  has\r\n\r\nconvinced  the  British? Or  is  it,  as  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has described, the electronic computer that\r\n\r\nhas  brought about Malaysia? When the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nmoved  his  motion, his speech was filled  with  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  threats levelled at the Opposition.  This\r\n\r\n- [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Prime Minister does not\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  Member  for  Upper  Serangoon   has\r\n\r\nundertaken to complete his speech in 30 minutes.

It will not be  of  any\r\n\r\nhelp.  And  we  have also decided that  we  want  to\r\n\r\nabstain from voting on this amendment. Otherwise the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will  construe our action as supporting  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's motion, because the basic character\r\n\r\nof   this  amending  motion  does  not  change   the\r\n\r\nsubstance of the original motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on the question whether the P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nconfident of itself, everybody is clear. I hope they\r\n\r\nwill  look after themselves, because more  and  more\r\n\r\npeople  will  begin to know after 31st  August  that\r\n\r\nthere are at least three Back-benchers of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwho  will either have to leave the P.A.P. themselves\r\n\r\nor  be expelled by the P.A.P. 31st August will come.\r\n\r\nIt  is  just  around  the  corner  -  [Interruption]\r\n\r\nWhether  you describe what I have said as a divisive\r\n\r\naction  it does not matter, but we can see that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  as  a  political force  in  this  area,  is\r\n\r\nalready finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped,\r\n\r\nalthough somewhat forlornly, that before the end  of\r\n\r\nthis Assembly, the House would rise to the occasion.\r\n\r\nWe  are  debating today not the future of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nor  the  future  of  the Barisan  Sosialis,  or  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Grand Alliance. We are taking a  decision\r\n\r\nof momentous proportions, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause it is of momentous proportions, I have  been\r\n\r\nsomewhat  circumspect in the way in which my  motion\r\n\r\nhas  been  phrased.  I  wish  to  repeat  that  this\r\n\r\nadoption is a conditional adoption, subject  to  all\r\n\r\nthe  terms  which have been agreed in the  documents\r\n\r\nset  out in Misc. 5 of 1963, which. I think, in view\r\n\r\nof the way the debate has gone, I shall have to take\r\n\r\nthe House through in some detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had expected, whatever happens, the\r\n\r\nCommunists, like the Member for Upper Serangoon,  to\r\n\r\ntake   the  same  consistent  anti-national,   anti-Malaysia  line. They cannot change, it is  too  late\r\n\r\nfor them. I had expected the Member for Hong Lim who\r\n\r\nis a specialist well versed in the arts of The Three\r\n\r\nKingdoms  to  take exactly a parallel line  but  not\r\n\r\nquite.  As I have explained earlier in the  opening,\r\n\r\nthere  are  cohorts going into battle. They  believe\r\n\r\nthey  have  25  per cent; I think it  is  less  now.\r\n\r\nSomebody  has to inherit this 25 per cent.  And  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim is hoping that the banner of the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis will fall from their grasp  as  the\r\n\r\nbattle is joined after the 31st of August: and  then\r\n\r\nseeing  a similar banner with a similar slogan,  the\r\n\r\ncohorts  will go with him. I had even half  expected\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson, true to his real nature, to do\r\n\r\nanother acrobatic act. The miracle that he performed\r\n\r\nin  July/August  last year, he has unperformed  this\r\n\r\nyear: back again - second-class citizenship, Singapore\r\n\r\nis being sold out. Sir, what he said and what I said\r\n\r\nis   on  the  record  and  on  the  tapes  of  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore. We could play them back. I could take him\r\n\r\nthrough every single clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I did not expect the stupidity of the Grand\r\n\r\nAlliance. Sir, I do not know if they knew what  they\r\n\r\nwere doing. Perhaps the 15 seats rattled them whilst\r\n\r\nI  was  away  in Cameron Highlands at  the  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  meeting, and they suddenly took a  position\r\n\r\nof   being   against  the  Government  and   against\r\n\r\neverything.  But I would have thought that  even  if\r\n\r\none   plays   poker,   one   should   consider   the\r\n\r\npossibilities of winning. Taking this  line,  lining\r\n\r\nup  with the Barisan Sosialis to the point where the\r\n\r\nMember  for Upper Serangoon for the first  time  has\r\n\r\nfound words to praise the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPark,  I do not think, Mr Speaker, Sir, with  great\r\n\r\nrespect, is an intelligent line. It is not the  sort\r\n\r\nof thing which sensible coherent leaders do, if they\r\n\r\ncalculate. And I make no bones about the  fact  that\r\n\r\nwe spend all our time calculating the possibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will first dispose of the Grand Alliance\r\n\r\nbecause they are the less troublesome. By doing this\r\n\r\nsomersault,  what little following they  have,  they\r\n\r\nhave  thrown into complete disarray. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  they know the incalculable consequences  of\r\n\r\nleaders  suddenly doing a volte face. I  would  have\r\n\r\nthought  that they were more right than I was;  they\r\n\r\nwere  more determined to have merger at any cost.  I\r\n\r\nwas  determined on merger on fair and just terms  or\r\n\r\nto  let the British take the consequences, and  even\r\n\r\nnow  that  is my position. I know there are  members\r\n\r\nfrom  the U.K. Commission who are listening and  who\r\n\r\nwill be reading this with great interest, and I  say\r\n\r\nthis  categorically, that what we say  categorically\r\n\r\nwe  never withdraw from. If the terms set out in the\r\n\r\nexchanges of letters, including the documents signed\r\n\r\nby  the  Tunku,  the envelope - the piece  of  toilet\r\n\r\npaper,  according to the Member for  Cairnhill  - are\r\n\r\nnot  fulfilled, then I am not prepared to defend the\r\n\r\nConstitution:  I  do not have to.  These  are  terms\r\n\r\nagreed.   They  are  conditions  precedent   to   my\r\n\r\nsignature at Marlborough House on the night  of  8th\r\n\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, for the S.P.A. I was not here, because I\r\n\r\nhad many other matters of a constitutional nature to\r\n\r\nattend to. I thought the saddest thing was that  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill was no longer in a position  to\r\n\r\nlead his Party in this debate. He had to leave it to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Farrer Park. Sir, I have always had a\r\n\r\nlot  of time for the Member for Farrer Park. He  was\r\n\r\nin  his  own  way trying to do what he  thought  was\r\n\r\nright.  He  did  not  want to see  this  country  go\r\n\r\nCommunist; he did not want to see the country go  to\r\n\r\nruin  and  he  was  determined to  have  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I read his speech in today's papers  with\r\n\r\nsome  sorrow,  because this was not an  occasion  to\r\n\r\nplay  party  politics. He could have  risen  to  the\r\n\r\noccasion. He could really have led\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  retrieved  the position for the Grand  Alliance\r\n\r\n- grand only in name, Mr Speaker. What did he do? He\r\n\r\ntook out legalistic points about the changes in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  and he has got three of  them  on  the\r\n\r\namendments.  What happens to Members of this  House?\r\n\r\nAre  they automatically out of this Assembly because\r\n\r\nthey  have changed sides? What happens to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Aljunied? Is the Member for Farrer Park  really\r\n\r\nthat  ignorant  of  the law?  This  law  is  not  of\r\n\r\nretrospective  effect.  It  applies  to   the   next\r\n\r\nAssembly,  the next elections. Is he that  ignorant,\r\n\r\nor  was he trying to score a few points? He said  he\r\n\r\nwould  have preferred to give a $25 million straight\r\n\r\ngrant,  it would have been much cheaper and that  it\r\n\r\nwould have saved Singapore more money. Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nwant to go into this, but he has asked for this. Has\r\n\r\nhe  stopped to consider what he was saying? That his\r\n\r\nown  principals  in Kuala Lumpur - and  I  call  them\r\n\r\nprincipals and the Gentlemen in front of me  agents,\r\n\r\nthe  local  branch, the local agents; whatever  they\r\n\r\nsay they are no more than that -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Clarify, by all means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I wish\r\n\r\nto  clarify  that we have received no  directive  or\r\n\r\ninstruction   from  the  Federation.  We   carefully\r\n\r\nweighed the matter before we made our decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A tactical position, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. Nobody really believes the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill,  or  for that matter the Member  for  the\r\n\r\nSouthern Islands, is going to stand up and say. \"Boo\r\n\r\nto  the  Tunku\"?  Can they say boo  to  the  Tunku's\r\n\r\nsignature  on these documents? Are they saying  that\r\n\r\nthey would have done better if they had been in  our\r\n\r\nplace  giving $25 million away? $1\u00bd million interest\r\n\r\nin perpetuity plus $25 million which will never come\r\n\r\nback.  Let us go into the calculations, $1\u00bd  million\r\n\r\nin  perpetuity; 5\u00bd per cent interest at  World  Bank\r\n\r\nrate. We are lending $100 million; half labour; five\r\n\r\nyears,  no  interest; after five years,  if  we  are\r\n\r\nprosperous: World Bank review, by all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeans. But they must make Singapore prosperous: they\r\n\r\nmust  not  stymie Singapore. Furthermore, the  money\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be paid back. After the  fifth  year,\r\n\r\ninterest will be paid: fifteenth year, paid back and\r\n\r\nthe  Central Government guarantees the repayment.  I\r\n\r\nsay that is a business-like arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Farrer Park has raised three\r\n\r\namendments. I reject them utterly and absolutely  as\r\n\r\na  face-saving device to find a way out for  himself\r\n\r\nand  his Party. He is no ignoramus. He knows the law\r\n\r\nand I assume he has read his documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first point is \"Terms of office of Members.\" I\r\n\r\nstated  in  this House before I went to London  that\r\n\r\nthat  was what we were going to do, that in the next\r\n\r\nAssembly any Member who is elected on a Party ticket\r\n\r\nwhose  Party's symbol appears against his name,  and\r\n\r\nif  he  is expelled or resigns or crosses the Floor,\r\n\r\nhe  automatically  vacates this House.  We  are  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Sir, and we do this. If  they  win  the\r\n\r\nelections - make this an election issue - they have the\r\n\r\nright under section 19 of the State Constitution  to\r\n\r\nchange  it back and play musical chairs. Go back  to\r\n\r\nthe  people. I am prepared to do that, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  That is my stand. Vote against this and I will\r\n\r\ngo  back  to  the  country  and  fight  on  this  by\r\n\r\nourselves and we will prove that they are wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His second point is \"Safeguards for constitutional\r\n\r\nposition   of  Singapore\".  They  want   even   more\r\n\r\nconstitutional safeguards. The Government is not  to\r\n\r\nbe  trusted; you must have a two-thirds majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly. I say by all means. If they could get\r\n\r\nit,  if they are men of such great influence in  the\r\n\r\nGrand Alliance, let them go to Kuala Lumpur and  get\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku  and  his colleagues  to  agree.  I  will\r\n\r\nwelcome it rapturously and give them full marks  for\r\n\r\nit.  Do something which is quite different from  all\r\n\r\nthe  other  States. By all means. My worry  is,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, and I think the worry of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  not that the Singapore Government,  a\r\n\r\nnon-Alliance   Government,   will   agree   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government in giving a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcession not to our interest but that an  Alliance\r\n\r\nGovernment would not be in a position to resist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Why not? I\r\n\r\nwill  write  to the Tunku and mention this  and  say\r\n\r\nthat this is at the special behest of the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park and his colleagues who are afraid  that\r\n\r\nbecause  they  would  not  be  able  to  resist  the\r\n\r\nFederation,   therefore,  they   should   have   the\r\n\r\nsafeguards. Is that what he says? That is what he is\r\n\r\nreduced to - playing party politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third point is \"Filling of vacancies\". What is\r\n\r\nundemocratic about that? That is the constitution we\r\n\r\nhave  got.  That  is the position in  Britain.  Hugh\r\n\r\nGaitskell,  a Labour Leader, died in September  last\r\n\r\nyear  shortly after the Prime Ministers' conference.\r\n\r\nHis  by-election did not take place till  last  June\r\n\r\nthis year.

If they win, change the Constitution. This is\r\n\r\na  State  Constitution. It can  be  changed  at  the\r\n\r\nbehest of the State Assembly. Even if we drafted  it\r\n\r\nthe  way  the  Member for Farrer Park wanted,  there\r\n\r\nwould be nothing to prevent us from amending it  the\r\n\r\nway  we  want, if and when we win the next election.\r\n\r\nThey  can  do  it if and when they win. But  perhaps\r\n\r\nthey  consider the possibility of winning is such  a\r\n\r\nremote  eventuality that they have no confidence  in\r\n\r\nthemselves and that they are thinking of conscribing\r\n\r\na P.A.P. Government. The next contest is between the\r\n\r\nCommunists and us. I said that over four years  ago,\r\n\r\nat  the  last general election. It must be, and  the\r\n\r\nlast  Governor was wise enough. Had the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  had his way, we would have been  scrubbed\r\n\r\nout  from the contest and he would have had to  meet\r\n\r\nthe Communists and he would have been mashed up into\r\n\r\nmince-meat. We are here in one piece and  we  intend\r\n\r\nto  be  here  to  fight for what is  right  for  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Member for Cairnhill. Sir, I was not here,\r\n\r\nbut  I  was told he said, \"Well, what is wrong about\r\n\r\ntrying  to  make  a  little  bit  of  money  selling\r\n\r\naeroplanes  and  airports?\"  Nothing  at  all,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir. There is nothing wrong with that.  If\r\n\r\nhe  can make 5 per cent on $50 million, good luck to\r\n\r\nhim.  That  is  $2\u00bd million. Why not? All  over  the\r\n\r\nworld  there  are  contact men. If  you  are  not  a\r\n\r\ncontractor, you can be the chap who knows how to get\r\n\r\na  contract, or how to sell aeroplanes, even  though\r\n\r\nyou know nothing about aircraft. Why not? But what I\r\n\r\nam  saying is that is incompatible with his position\r\n\r\nas a leader of the people of Singapore. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I am sure you will never dream of doing it, for\r\n\r\nI  would feel somewhat ashamed. On the one hand, you\r\n\r\nsay, \"I will fight for the rights of Singapore,\" and\r\n\r\nstand  up to K.L. and say, \"Boo\" and \"No\", which  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  do  from time to time, even after  merger,\r\n\r\nafter  Malaysia: and, on the other  hand,  you  say,\r\n\r\n\"Would  you please buy this?\" You know, you probably\r\n\r\nwill  not get all the 5 per cent. You have  to  give\r\n\r\ncuts all along the line. Two per cent here, half per\r\n\r\ncent there, and maybe you wind up\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith 2\u00bd per cent. But still it is a lot of money.  I\r\n\r\nsay  that is what is wrong. It is incompatible  with\r\n\r\nstanding  up  for  the  rights  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And  instead of  choosing  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nargument  - what I say here, Mr Speaker, Sir,I  am\r\n\r\nprepared to say outside; no privilege - but  what  he\r\n\r\nsaid  here about Lee & Lee making money out  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians, implying that I and my wife are  making\r\n\r\nmoney  because of my position, I say, let  him  step\r\n\r\nout  of this Chamber, say that, and I give him  full\r\n\r\njustification  to  prove it.  I  will  go  into  the\r\n\r\nwitness box. The plaintiff in a suit for libel  goes\r\n\r\ninto  the witness box. He is cross-examined  and  is\r\n\r\nput  under close scrutiny. I am not afraid. My hands\r\n\r\nare clean and so are those of my colleagues. That is\r\n\r\nwhy  we are alive. His colleagues - what has happened\r\n\r\nto  them? Iron mining, factories - all lucrative, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. None of them that I know of are  dying\r\n\r\nof  starvation or malnutrition. But let me tell  him\r\n\r\nthis.  \"Arrogant\", he calls us. No - we are proud  to\r\n\r\nbelong to a group of men who will stand up for  what\r\n\r\nit  is right regardless of their personal interests.\r\n\r\nAnd  let me say this, that in the last three  months\r\n\r\nwe stood the risk that if Malaysia failed because we\r\n\r\nstood  for our rights, the risk of having really  to\r\n\r\nface  big trouble. It was a calculated risk. We also\r\n\r\nstand the risk of being dealt with, now that we have\r\n\r\ngot  the Finance Minister in the Federation somewhat\r\n\r\nunhappy, because the police will be handed  over.  I\r\n\r\ndid  not mention Chief Enahoru in jest, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  He was a Chief in his own right before Nigeria\r\n\r\ngot independence, just as I am a little chief in  my\r\n\r\nown  right  here today. And I will not be after  the\r\n\r\n31st of August. But I say, regardless of that, we do\r\n\r\nour  duty. By the time we have decided to fight  the\r\n\r\nprincipals behind the Member for Cairnhill,  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  going  to be bought by petty men,  or  thwarted\r\n\r\neither by spite or malice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I sympathise with the U.M.N.O. Members\r\n\r\nbecause  they are in real trouble. They  know  their\r\n\r\nground  situation. I visited the Member for  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai in his constituency on Sunday. I am sorry if I\r\n\r\nhad disturbed him till 2.00 a.m. in the morning. But\r\n\r\nhe knows what the ground situation is like. We have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  one quarrel, Mr Speaker, Sir. That is on what\r\n\r\nI  said  about khalwat. Now. I would like to clarify\r\n\r\nthis.  This is a serious matter for them and for  my\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I  made  the  statement  on   religious\r\n\r\nfreedom with due circumspection. I think it  is  the\r\n\r\nonly way out for Singapore. I have been attacked  by\r\n\r\nthe religious head of U.M.N.O. as interfering in the\r\n\r\naffairs of the rights of the Muslims. I desire to do\r\n\r\nno  such  thing. The Muslims decide Muslim  law  for\r\n\r\nthemselves,  and  there  is  the  Administration  of\r\n\r\nMuslim  Law Bill. There is a section there  - section\r\n\r\n131  (1)   and  131 (2)  - which talks of  cohabitation\r\n\r\noutside  marriage,  not khalwat.  Khalwat.  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nthis.  I  am  sorry we have to go into these  little\r\n\r\ndetails.  But it means a male and a female found  in\r\n\r\nclose proximity who are not unlawfully married. What\r\n\r\nclose proximity means is a matter -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Not lawfully married.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Not lawfully married - yes. If\r\n\r\nyou  are lawfully married, I think it is all  right.\r\n\r\nHowever, there will be a lot of trouble. I am  quite\r\n\r\nsure  it  is  not the intention of any  religion  to\r\n\r\nprevent the continuance of mankind. Well, I say that\r\n\r\nI  leave  the  Muslims  to decide  Muslim  laws  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.  What I am saying is that no non-Muslims\r\n\r\nin  Singapore will be covered by Muslim law. I think\r\n\r\nthat is fair. I cannot go beyond that. All I can say\r\n\r\nis  that I will not interfere with the Muslims. They\r\n\r\nhave their wishes. They do as they wish. I have,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, to speak up for a lot of Buddhists,\r\n\r\nChristians and others. And if all Christians  wanted\r\n\r\nto  apply canonic law on all Muslims and vice versa,\r\n\r\nand  Buddhists,  we would wind up by  slitting  each\r\n\r\nother's throat. Once religion becomes a major factor\r\n\r\nin  a  multi-racial community, as it did in  Ceylon,\r\n\r\nthen we are in trouble. I am quite sure that is  not\r\n\r\nthe  intention  of  Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff.  \"Syed\"\r\n\r\nmeans a descendant of the Prophet, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nI  am  quite  sure it is not his intention  to  have\r\n\r\nbloodshed  in this country.

I am quite happy to\r\n\r\nanswer any other points if the Member would write to\r\n\r\nme.  I  will give a considered reply. But I want  to\r\n\r\nget this on the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister is not giving way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Member for Anson talks\r\n\r\nabout  the  Blue Book and the White Book,  the  Blue\r\n\r\nBook  being  the  one in London and the  White  Book\r\n\r\nbeing the one we have tabled here. They are not  the\r\n\r\nsame.  I  told the House that there were  amendments\r\n\r\nand that I was introducing more amendments. They are\r\n\r\nnot in accordance with the exchange of letters. As I\r\n\r\nunderstood  it  from my colleagues, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson considers the Blue Book to be the Master copy.\r\n\r\nThat  is not so, Mr Speaker, Sir. As far as we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,   the   master   copy   is   ours.    The\r\n\r\nConstitutional  documents  plus  the  exchanges   of\r\n\r\nletters,  and  if the conditions are not  fulfilled,\r\n\r\nthen I say the British can hand over Singapore. I am\r\n\r\nnor  defending  this.  They  can  go  to  Television\r\n\r\nSingapura, Radio Singapore, the Press, mass meetings\r\n\r\nand  explain.  If  I  am  to explain,  then  I  want\r\n\r\nsomething  which is right, fair, just and honourable\r\n\r\nsettlement and we stick to the bargain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is fair that I should mention this\r\n\r\nletter  which  I  have received. The United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nHigh  Commissioner has written me  a  letter,  dated\r\n\r\ntoday,  saying  that  he would like  all  amendments\r\n\r\nwhich  have been made on the Blue Book to be  agreed\r\n\r\nin  precise  terms with the Tunku. He says  \"by  the\r\n\r\nTunku\",  but I say, \"with the Tunku\", and  that  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Commissioner should be Informed of it so  that\r\n\r\nhe  could make the necessary amendments in the Order\r\n\r\nin Council which will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  made.  My position is quite simple, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,If  the  amendments are not  made,  I  am  not\r\n\r\ndefending this Constitution. I have agreed to what I\r\n\r\nhave  agreed.  They  are written words,  simple  and\r\n\r\nclear,  and must be incorporated, not least  of  all\r\n\r\nthe  provision on gangsters. I make no secret of the\r\n\r\nfact that I view with the greatest apprehension  the\r\n\r\npossibility, if this power is removed, of  gangsters\r\n\r\nbeing  involved in elections as they  are  in  other\r\n\r\nparts  of  the country. I have got one head gangster\r\n\r\nwho   was  the  former  driver  of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill under detention in St. John's Island,  and\r\n\r\nhe  will  remain there. If the Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\ncan  win  the elections without him, he can  release\r\n\r\nhim  and his own gang. But as long as I am here,  he\r\n\r\nwill remain, and no gangster will participate in the\r\n\r\nelections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the exchange of letters. The Member for Anson\r\n\r\nhas  made great play of this, and I think it is only\r\n\r\nfair  that I should go through it. He said that  the\r\n\r\nfirst  letter has nine points, not answered. I think\r\n\r\nhe is being wilfully obtuse, Mr Speaker, Sir. There\r\n\r\nare nine points in the letter dated the 8th of July.\r\n\r\nTun  Razak  wrote me a letter on the  18th  of  July\r\n\r\nreturning me the letters, including this one. I  saw\r\n\r\nhim personally, and I wrote him back. May I read  my\r\n\r\nletter? That was the 22nd July, the day I went up to\r\n\r\nKuala Lumpur:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have your letter of 18th July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can ignore the letter containing\r\n\r\nthe  eight  points [because the last point  was  Cut\r\n\r\nout.  Mr  Speaker. Sir] because the note which  the\r\n\r\nTunku  signed said that the last part of this letter\r\n\r\nabout  the  Inter-Governmental Committee was  to  be\r\n\r\ncancelled. This will make no sense unless the letter\r\n\r\nis  in Fact published. As for the other points,  you\r\n\r\nhave  agreed  to  them, although they  will  not  be\r\n\r\nenshrined in the Constitution. I am happy  to  leave\r\n\r\nit at that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two letters have been superseded by this\r\n\r\nsigned note and can be ignored.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  signed  note is in the photostat  copy  of  the\r\n\r\nletter  enclosing. There is a simple interpretation,\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,  Sir  - the  rule  of  interpretation:\r\n\r\nexpressio  unius  excusio alterii. \"Last  part  out\"\r\n\r\n- you  will see that - \"Ritz Hotel, 8-7-63\".  I  heard\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Anson made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfun  of  the  Tunku's statement - the letter  of  7th\r\n\r\nJuly.  I  think he was a bit anxious that we  should\r\n\r\nnot  run  out of the 8th into the 9th and so perhaps\r\n\r\nin  the  anxiety  of  the  moment  he  misdated  his\r\n\r\nsignature.  But I dated it the 8th. \"Last  part  out\r\n\r\n- Inter. Govt. Committee\" -  that refers to point No. 9\r\n\r\nin  the  letter of 8th July. The others are in,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point about loans does not have to be\r\n\r\nenshrined  in  the  Constitution.  It  is   in   the\r\n\r\nAgreement. We are giving a loan of $30 million  each\r\n\r\nyear  for five years, $20 million interest-free  and\r\n\r\n$10  million with interest. If the condition is  not\r\n\r\nfulfilled,  the loan is cancelled. I make  no  bones\r\n\r\nabout   that   either.  This  is   a   business-like\r\n\r\narrangement  in the mutual interests of  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories  and  Singapore.  The  Federation   have\r\n\r\ncommitted themselves to development to the  tune  of\r\n\r\n$500 million. They want to find the money. They have\r\n\r\nasked  us  to help with $150 million. All right.  We\r\n\r\nare partial bankers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others - \"S'pore L. Assemblymen: - resignation\r\n\r\nor  expulsion  - vacate seat\". That has been  agreed,\r\n\r\nand even in a telegram from Kuala Lumpur to my State\r\n\r\nAdvocate-General,   the  Attorney-General   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  has  agreed to that.  So  what  are  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill and the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\ncomplaining about? If they do not like it,  win  the\r\n\r\nnext elections and cancel it. Tell the Tunku that he\r\n\r\nis  wrong.  \"Immigration restriction Order movement.\r\n\r\nreciprocal\".  We  are  now  talking  in   terms   of\r\n\r\ngangsters and other political undesirables.  I  have\r\n\r\nstated  that  if  they have the right  to  keep  our\r\n\r\nundesirables out, we want Mr James Puthucheary, Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull, and Mr Fong Swee Suan, including Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nChing  Siong (when we prove ultimately that he comes\r\n\r\nfrom   Pontian)  out  of  this  place  and  so  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  a healthier, more peaceful and a  happier\r\n\r\nplace  to  live  in.  Then the Gangsters  Ordinance,\r\n\r\ndelegation. Sir, I want to make my position clear on\r\n\r\nthis.  My  State  Advocate-General  has  received  a\r\n\r\ncommunication to say that they were delegated by way\r\n\r\nof an executive administrative act, using one of the\r\n\r\nArticles of the present Constitution. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam  not satisfied with that because this must be  in\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution and not by an administrative  act.\r\n\r\nBy  an  administrative act, something may happen  in\r\n\r\nsix  months'  time.  The Member  for  Cairnhill  is\r\n\r\nalways  buzzing  around in Kuala Lumpur.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nblame  him.  He  tries for his  friend.  His  former\r\n\r\nchauffeur  who  is  now  in St.  John's  writes  him\r\n\r\nplaintive letters. He dare not reply to them because\r\n\r\nhe  can do nothing about it. The chances are that he\r\n\r\nwill  remain in a position where he can  do  nothing\r\n\r\nabout it. And I would like to keep things happy that\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other matter which is of sonic\r\n\r\nimportance, viz, my letter of 8th July regarding the\r\n\r\n$10  million.  All  these are  conditions  before  I\r\n\r\nsigned  the Agreement. I say that if we do  not  get\r\n\r\nthe  $10  million, there again it is not  worth  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government's  while  either.  I  paid   the\r\n\r\nBritish what I thought to be a tribute well deserved\r\n\r\n- that  they  are like an electronic computer,  maybe\r\n\r\nnot  the  representative himself but he has a  team,\r\n\r\nthe expertise, the experience of a whole machine. If\r\n\r\nthe  Members think it is worth their while quibbling\r\n\r\nabout  a few million dollars, it is for them  to  go\r\n\r\nand explain to the people of Singapore instead of me\r\n\r\n- I  nearly lost my voice. Mr Speaker, Sir.  But  we\r\n\r\nare  going  to keep on going at this until  we  nail\r\n\r\nevery  falsehood down. I came back for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  have nailed every falsehood down,  then  we\r\n\r\nwill go to Africa and make friends because, if Chief\r\n\r\nEnchoro  had more friends, there would have  been  a\r\n\r\nbetter  chance. I make no bones about this. We  know\r\n\r\nexactly  what we are doing. We calculate the  pieces\r\n\r\non  the chessboard ten moves ahead. That is the  way\r\n\r\nit must be done. The enemy does that. They say brave\r\n\r\nthings in this Chamber, but they know that they  are\r\n\r\ngone. Their thinkers and planners behind admit  that\r\n\r\nthey  have lost the battle against Malaysia - sending\r\n\r\nplaintive telegrams to Manila. That is not going  to\r\n\r\nhelp them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, before I dispose of the Member for Anson,\r\n\r\nI  think  my  colleague, the Finance  Minister,  has\r\n\r\ndealt with the matter at some length. All I want  to\r\n\r\nsay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  this. Sir, on the World Bank team, three of them\r\n\r\nwere  members  of  a very talented race.  They  were\r\n\r\nJews; very hard-headed businessmen. Three members on\r\n\r\nour  Economic Development Board - the Director who was\r\n\r\nsent by way of secondment to the United Nations, the\r\n\r\nEconomic   Adviser  (Prof.  Cahen),  the   Technical\r\n\r\nConsultant, and the Chemical Engineer are also Jews;\r\n\r\nmen  of  considerable talent. So is the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson.  But  I prefer to put my money on  the  genes\r\n\r\nthese gentlemen inherited as against the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson.  You  cannot have every member in the  family\r\n\r\ntalented  with strong muscles and nerves and  compos\r\n\r\nmentis. [Interruption] Sometimes [Interruption] -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Time is getting on interjections from\r\n\r\nthe Government Bench should stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> But it speaks volumes for the\r\n\r\npractical and businesslike manner in which they have\r\n\r\nset  out their Report. I think we have got our point\r\n\r\nacross  to the World Bank, as against the Federation\r\n\r\npoint of view. Let me make no bones about this.  All\r\n\r\nthis  is  part of history. The Federation  wanted  a\r\n\r\ncomplete economic Customs Union immediately  formed.\r\n\r\nThen  we  would have been killed. One-third  of  the\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade  would  have  died.  Two-thirds   of\r\n\r\nprimary  produce  would  not be  affected,  whatever\r\n\r\nhappens. The other one-third: I am reported  in  the\r\n\r\nPress  as saying that it would go, but that  is  not\r\n\r\nwhat  I said. What I said is: over 12 years, we will\r\n\r\nhave to make other arrangements, as they get covered\r\n\r\nby  customs duties', only one-third gets covered  by\r\n\r\ncustoms duties. We have the World Bank on our  side,\r\n\r\npartly  because  we have four bright  men  from  the\r\n\r\nchosen race speaking to truly bright men - three out\r\n\r\nof  the eight - on the other side, also of the chosen\r\n\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a matter of more substance - citizenship. I\r\n\r\nexpected  this: second-class, and a  whole  host  of\r\n\r\nlies  and  falsehoods. But what  is  interesting  is\r\n\r\nthis.  The  Member  for Anson, who  must  have  some\r\n\r\nregard for his own personal professional reputation,\r\n\r\nhas not taken the line of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. My colleague,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs,  had no time to give a point-by-point\r\n\r\nreply.  He will do so through the Press.  A  lot  of\r\n\r\nfalsehoods  have  been uttered  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  either  through  ignorance  or   wilful\r\n\r\nmalice.  The  Member  for  Anson  took  an  entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent  line.  His line was: it is  second-class,\r\n\r\nbecause   there   is  no  freedom  of   association,\r\n\r\neducation  and  labour. We cannot have  it  on  both\r\n\r\nsides.  You  cannot spread butter on both  sides  of\r\n\r\nyour  bread.  Either  you  have  State  autonomy  in\r\n\r\neducation and labour, in which case you say you have\r\n\r\nthe  right  to exclude others from the enjoyment  of\r\n\r\nthese  privileges, or you go in. If the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson together with the Member for Cairnhill can win\r\n\r\nthe  next  elections, and agree to surrender  labour\r\n\r\nand  education,  then  so be it.  There  will  be  a\r\n\r\nsimilar   education   policy,  interchangeable   for\r\n\r\nstudents.  We  will all pay taxes  and  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  look after everything.  I  put  my\r\n\r\nposition quite clear in April, and I have done  what\r\n\r\nI  have stated. I am prepared to go out publicly  to\r\n\r\nexplain and defend it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson quoted a Chinese proverb.\r\n\r\nMy  Political  Secretary - that is  the  advantage  of\r\n\r\nhaving  a  Political Secretary who  is  educated  in\r\n\r\nChinese - said there is no such Chinese proverb. What\r\n\r\nhe  said  was Li fu t'iau chiang - \"A tiger  cornered\r\n\r\nhas  to  jump over the wall.\" He said he  has  never\r\n\r\nheard  of it because tigers are never found  in  the\r\n\r\ncity  area where there are walls. I went back during\r\n\r\nthe  adjournment  and looked up my book  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nproverbs. I could not find the proverb. But I  could\r\n\r\nfind  another  proverb - Kouchi  t'iau  chiang  - \"A\r\n\r\ncornered  dog  jumps over the wall.\" That  is  where\r\n\r\nthey  are - cornered dogs. They asked for this.  They\r\n\r\ngrowled, they barked, they snapped for two years. We\r\n\r\ntold  them, \"For God's sake, be reasonable  domestic\r\n\r\nanimals.\" You know, we are feeding them with $500  a\r\n\r\nmonth. We are giving them a reasonable living.  They\r\n\r\nwent  running around as if they had the rabies.  And\r\n\r\nnow,  as  the proverb goes, they have t'iau  chiang.\r\n\r\nWhether the wall is - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Too\r\n\r\nhigh!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Whether they can really make\r\n\r\nthe  wall, that is their business.

That  is  the  key\r\n\r\nreason  for  Malaysia. That is why we are  going  to\r\n\r\nspend  a  lot  of  money  on defence;  waste  money.\r\n\r\n\"Tunku's  foreign policy is wrong,\" says the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Upper  Serangoon. \"That is why we have  got  to\r\n\r\nspend money.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson is not here, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.  He wrote me a letter and he wrote you a letter\r\n\r\nabout this defence agreement which was published  in\r\n\r\n1957.  Now  it  is  going to  apply  throughout  the\r\n\r\nterritories  of  Malaysia. I  say,  \"Thank  God  for\r\n\r\nthat.\" Let us be realists. Do they really want to go\r\n\r\nout  and expect the Federation Army of 8,000 men and\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Army, now Second  Battalion,  2,000;\r\n\r\n8,000  +  2,000  equals 10,000 men to fight  against\r\n\r\narmies  of  half  a million men? In South-East  Asia\r\n\r\nthere  are armies of half a million men. I am  here,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, because there is peace, there  is\r\n\r\nsecurity; otherwise I think our Serjeant at Arms may\r\n\r\nbe  absent, if there are riots, commotion: the army,\r\n\r\nthe  navy, troops capture the city. We cannot expect\r\n\r\nchaps  to  turn  up  and behave as  if  nothing  has\r\n\r\nhappened. This is not a laughing matter I would like\r\n\r\nto  point  out to the Member for Anson  - I  hope  he\r\n\r\nreads  this.  He  has  condemned  this  document  by\r\n\r\ninference,  and throwing it. He says he  is  tabling\r\n\r\nit.  Let  me  read him what he agreed to  which  the\r\n\r\nBritish  rejected in 1956. He was giving the British\r\n\r\n- I  am  quoting now from Sessional Paper Cmd. 31  of\r\n\r\n1956. He is always doing what the former Member  for\r\n\r\nTiong  Bahru  used  to  say,  \"Licking  up  his  own\r\n\r\nspittle.\"  This is what he did. He gave the  British\r\n\r\nbases in perpetuity. Here we are giving them a lease\r\n\r\n- 30  years. After 30 years the lease expires. If  by\r\n\r\n30  years  we  have  not stabilised  ourselves  then\r\n\r\nreally  we  are in trouble. But 30 years is  a  long\r\n\r\ntime in the life of South-East Asia and we will  see\r\n\r\na  lot  of  changes. We shall grow in  strength  and\r\n\r\nstature and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregion  will  grow in stability. Meanwhile,  let  us\r\n\r\nhave  no  power vacuum. Does he really  want  us  to\r\n\r\nclose  down  the bases? He will be out of  practice,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir. There will be no lawyers to defend\r\n\r\nall  these  petty cases of seduction and  kidnapping\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  When the country is being  looted  and\r\n\r\nplundered  and raped, do you think people have  time\r\n\r\nto  prosecute  each  other  for  kidnapping,  taking\r\n\r\nobscene  pictures and so on? No, Sir. All that  goes\r\n\r\nby  the way-side while you try to survive. I do  not\r\n\r\nread  that sort of story elsewhere. It only  happens\r\n\r\nin  stable, secure societies. Then you get  Profumo,\r\n\r\nChristine Keeler, Ward - lewd pictures of eminent men\r\n\r\nwho  may  or  may not have frolicked in  a  swimming\r\n\r\npool.  Well,  that is a stable society. An  unstable\r\n\r\none  was in Japanese-occupied Singapore. Every other\r\n\r\nday  there was a rape case. Nobody took any  notice.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for Anson ought to count his  blessings\r\n\r\nthat because of us he is still making a good living.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would  like to remind him of this.  That  he\r\n\r\nagreed to give in perpetuity - and, what is more, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I do not understand the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson.  I have tabled documents which I will  defend\r\n\r\nand which I intend to defend. \"My dear Secretary for\r\n\r\nState\". He writes to me: \"My dear Prime Minister\". I\r\n\r\nwrite to Tun Razak - these are formal letters. I  may\r\n\r\nbe  Tun Razak's old classmate and friend, but we are\r\n\r\nwriting  to each other in our formal capacities:  My\r\n\r\ndear  Deputy  Prime  Minister\".  We  never  get  our\r\n\r\npersonal  and  official capacities mixed  up.  As  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative of Singapore, I write  formally.  Not\r\n\r\nso the Member for Anson. They make gruesome reading,\r\n\r\nyou  know. I refer to Misc. No. 2 of 1956. This  was\r\n\r\nto  the  old  Secretary  of State:  \"My  dear  Alan\"\r\n\r\n- signed  \"David\".  Reply: \"My  dear  David\"  - signed\r\n\r\n\"Alan\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, things got a hit chilly and the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  State - No. 2 in the Colonial Office then - said,\r\n\r\n\"Dear  David\",  the \"My\" has been dropped  out.  But\r\n\r\npoor David still wrote: \"My dear John\". That was Mr\r\n\r\nJohn  Hare.  That is where I said to the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill, he and his former Chief Minister get\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir personal and official capacities mixed up.  Ah\r\n\r\nHong  Construction is Ah Hong Construction. But  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  is the Singapore  Government.\r\n\r\nThey are two different things. I am not saying it is\r\n\r\nwrong  to be a contact man to make money. All  I  am\r\n\r\nsaying is, I think it is an invidious position to be\r\n\r\nin,  to  say  that you stand up and  fight  for  the\r\n\r\nrights  of  Singapore when, in fact, you are  asking\r\n\r\nfor  favours.  To  build the  University  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nbuildings,  Ah Hong Construction got a big  contract\r\n\r\nthere.  Singapore,  they get their  fingers  chopped\r\n\r\noff.  And  I say this goes for even after  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nTenders put in properly, no contact man required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the time for reckoning has now come\r\n\r\n[Interruption].  I  am glad to see  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson turn up because -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have always made it a point\r\n\r\nto  tell Members not to comment on Members coming in\r\n\r\nor going out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I beg your pardon. But,\r\n\r\nanyway,  everybody is here to be reckoned - to  stand\r\n\r\nup and speak up and be counted. The battle lines are\r\n\r\nbeing drawn. The battle lines outside may or may not\r\n\r\nhe  drawn  and  I  hope things will  be  settled  in\r\n\r\nManila. But the battle lines within the country  are\r\n\r\nbeing  drawn. We had better decide what  jerseys  we\r\n\r\nare  wearing. Either you arc for Malaysia or you are\r\n\r\nagainst Malaysia. Do not run with the hare and  hunt\r\n\r\nwith the hounds. It is an unprofitable business. The\r\n\r\nBritish  may be a little bit squeamish about  having\r\n\r\nto do in somebody they had made use of, even a Chief\r\n\r\nMinister or a former Prime Minister. But let me say,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, that nationalist governments  all\r\n\r\nover the world, when they assume power and they face\r\n\r\nopposition  which is irresponsible,  deal  summarily\r\n\r\nwith  it.  And having had to deal with irresponsible\r\n\r\nopposition, although very fortunately in  our  case,\r\n\r\nwe did not have to deal\r\n\r\nsummarily with them, I nevertheless sympathise  with\r\n\r\nthose  leaders  - Abu  Bakar of Nigeria,  bong  Chief\r\n\r\nEnohoru, extradited, recalled, in gaol: Ghana  chaps\r\n\r\nfled to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneighbouring territories. In Algiers, and  it  is  a\r\n\r\ntough place, and they fought a tough war, a Minister\r\n\r\nwas  shot - assassinated. He was the youngest  Member\r\n\r\nof  the  Cabinet. One day after I left, I read  that\r\n\r\none  former  Minister of the Provisional  Government\r\n\r\nwas  walking along Algiers, a car drew up,  he  went\r\n\r\nin, and he has not been heard of since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sympathies are for law and order. If I tried to\r\n\r\nundermine the Tunku's Government, then I expect  him\r\n\r\nto  lock me up. I think he would be a fool if he did\r\n\r\nnot.  It  is  his  duty.  My  business  as  a  loyal\r\n\r\nOpposition is to see that Malaysia survives. This is\r\n\r\nthe time when we all speak up. We are prepared to go\r\n\r\nto the country by ourselves and defend this, without\r\n\r\nthe Grand Alliance. If they want to abstain, they do\r\n\r\nso  at  their  own  peril. They  are  playing  party\r\n\r\npolitics. Why not rise above this pettiness? This is\r\n\r\nsomething  bigger than ourselves. This is  going  to\r\n\r\nensure  our  survival. I am quoting the  Member  for\r\n\r\nFarrer Park now. He said that it so happened that  I\r\n\r\nwas  the  Prime Minister at a time, in  a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  things came about. The cataclysm took  place,\r\n\r\ncrystallization,  Malaysia and  merger.  Not  he.  I\r\n\r\nplayed  a  part, yes. Why go against the will  of  a\r\n\r\npeople to be born, to be free, to survive in a world\r\n\r\nfull  of  strife  and turmoil? And more  strife  and\r\n\r\nturmoil  coming. Let us not misjudge the  situation.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand chaps are under training in Sarawak;  a\r\n\r\nlong  border;  arms  are being  supplied.  He  is  a\r\n\r\nfoolish  man who expects a Central Government  faced\r\n\r\nwith  that situation to sit back and let the country\r\n\r\ngo  to  pieces. I for one, Sir, and  I  am  sure  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues are with me here, will stand up and fight\r\n\r\nfor Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Original Question was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In pursuance of the resolution of this House\r\n\r\ntaken on the 10th June, 1963 that there should be an\r\n\r\nearly settlement fair and just to both sides on  the\r\n\r\nbasis of the terms of the White Paper (Paper Cmd. 33\r\n\r\nof  1961) and mindful of the long and arduous battle\r\n\r\nfor merger, this House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>WELCOMES   the  successful  outcome  in  the   final\r\n\r\nagreement reached in London on 9th July, 1963, which\r\n\r\nagreement contains the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterms  in the said White Paper with amendments  made\r\n\r\non  a  quid  pro  quo  basis,  Singapore  getting  a\r\n\r\nMalaysian   Common   Market   written    into    the\r\n\r\nConstitution   in   return  for  a   percentage   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's revenue of national taxes instead of  an\r\n\r\nannual lump sum as contribution for Federal services\r\n\r\nin Singapore, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>TAKING  COGNIZANCE of the exchange of  memoranda  on\r\n\r\nthe  financial arrangements as in Paper Misc.  4  of\r\n\r\n1963 which sets out the basis on which the Singapore\r\n\r\nand   Federation   Governments  arrived   at   their\r\n\r\nrespective  percentages  and  the  component   parts\r\n\r\nthereof, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>SUBJECT to the fulfilment of the conditions set  out\r\n\r\nin  the  exchange of letters between  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the Federation Government  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  and  the  British  Government\r\n\r\ncontained in Paper Misc. 5 of 1963, this House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>ADOPTS  the constitutional provisions and amendments\r\n\r\ncontained  in  Paper  Cmd.  22  of  1963   and   the\r\n\r\namendments  thereof contained in Paper  Cmd.  24  of\r\n\r\n1963.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Since which, an amendment has been moved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To leave out from \"1961\" in line 4 to the end and\r\n\r\ninsert\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\"this  House noting that the agreement made  between\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Action Party Government,  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  Government  and the  Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  London  on 9th  July,  1963,  is  at\r\n\r\nvariance with Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) condemns the Government for signing such an\r\n\r\nagreement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) demands that the Government immediately\r\n\r\nrepudiate the said agreement; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) urges that a general election be held fairly\r\n\r\nconducted  under the supervision of the  United\r\n\r\nNations  in  order  that the people  may  elect\r\n\r\ntheir    new    representatives    for    fresh\r\n\r\nconstitutional  talks with the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment.\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the words, proposed to be left\r\n\r\nout, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 16; Noes, 32;\r\n\r\nAbstentions, 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Ayes.
