She is less dependent on\r\n\r\nthe  traditional entrepot trade, She is developing\r\n\r\ninto   a   centre  for  manufacturing,  servicing,\r\n\r\ntransportation   and  communications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the\r\n\r\nBritish Government announced in January 1968  that\r\n\r\nthey  were going to pull out their forces  by  the\r\n\r\nend   of  1971,  there  was  widespread  fear   of\r\n\r\nunemployment.   Unions,   management    and    the\r\n\r\ngovernment  worked hard to create  the  conditions\r\n\r\nfor rapid and massive investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We succeeded. At present, there is a temporary\r\n\r\nshortage  of  workers.  Work  permits  are  freely\r\n\r\nissued to skilled and semi-skilled workers, and to\r\n\r\nunskilled  workers  for heavy manual  jobs.  Block\r\n\r\npermits are given to building contractors so  that\r\n\r\nwork  is not slowed down all over Singapore,  from\r\n\r\nurban  renewal, to new satellite towns, factories,\r\n\r\nroads, flyovers, canals and reservoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Married quarters and other accommodation formerly\r\n\r\nused  by  the  civilians employed by the  British\r\n\r\nServices, and not suitable for the Singapore Armed\r\n\r\nForces,  will soon be released. They  can  provide\r\n\r\naccommodation  for  over 10,000  new  work  permit\r\n\r\nholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that our industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme should not stall for lack of skilled, or\r\n\r\nif   unskilled,  then  educated,  industrious  and\r\n\r\neasily trainable, workers. The policy of free work\r\n\r\npermits  will  continue until  the  re-cycling  of\r\n\r\nnational service recruits has evened out. In about\r\n\r\nthree years, the national service intake will  not\r\n\r\nexceed  the numbers going into the reserves.  Then\r\n\r\nwe   should  have  reached  conditions   of   full\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, my government has plans to\r\n\r\nsystematically mechanise laborious and  repetitive\r\n\r\nwork. The private sector will be encouraged to  do\r\n\r\nthe  same.  There  is a limit  to  the  inflow  of\r\n\r\nunskilled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-citizen workers we can absorb if the fabric of\r\n\r\nour  society  is  not  to  be  strained.  We  want\r\n\r\neconomic  growth to raise the standards of  living\r\n\r\nof  our  people.  We want better schools  for  our\r\n\r\nchildren,  better  homes,  with  playing   fields,\r\n\r\ngardens, parks, and recreational amenities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must become viable in defence. Through the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth   Five-Power  defence   arrangements,\r\n\r\nstability  and  security are assured  for  several\r\n\r\nyears ahead. But we must make use of this time  to\r\n\r\nconsolidate our own defence capability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence has had to overcome many\r\n\r\nproblems.  They  are  the  result  of  very  rapid\r\n\r\nexpansion in the last few years. In the  next  few\r\n\r\nyears,  the heavy expenditure for the purchase  of\r\n\r\narms  and  equipment for defence will  level  off.\r\n\r\nThen  a  greater share of our revenue can go  into\r\n\r\neducation, health and social services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the rapid pace of development is\r\n\r\nmaking  land  more  scarce, and resettlement  more\r\n\r\ndifficult, especially for farmers. As our economic\r\n\r\nposition  is  now  stronger,  my  government   has\r\n\r\ndecided  to  give higher rates of compensation  to\r\n\r\ntenants  and  ex gratia payments to squatters  for\r\n\r\nresettlement. Shops and industries in  government-owned   or   acquired  premises   will   now   get\r\n\r\nresettlement  ex gratia payments. Genuine  farmers\r\n\r\nwill be given more generous terms of resettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to continue our rapid growth, we have\r\n\r\nto  import  part of the capital, and most  of  the\r\n\r\ntechnology,    the   management   and    marketing\r\n\r\nexpertise.  A  considerable part  of  the  wealth,\r\n\r\nincreasingly evident since the last two years,  in\r\n\r\nexpensive   shopping  complexes,  hotels,   office\r\n\r\nblocks and factories, represents imported capital.\r\n\r\nIt  will take time and experience to build up  our\r\n\r\nown  corps  of  managers, engineers and  marketing\r\n\r\nexperts. With time, our people will increase their\r\n\r\nparticipation in the owning and the running of the\r\n\r\nnew enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, for the present it is foolish not to admit\r\n\r\nthat however shrewd and wealthy our merchants are,\r\n\r\nmany  have  not yet learned how to  run  a  modern\r\n\r\ncorporation,  where  ownership  is  separate  from\r\n\r\nmanagement.  Our investors and entrepreneurs  have\r\n\r\nto   develop  new  attitudes  necessary  for   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of industries, and other  enterprises.\r\n\r\nRecently,   a   British  group  of  stock   market\r\n\r\noperators quietly bought the majority stocks of  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  company,  and then sold  the  company's\r\n\r\nholdings   in  a  bank  and  in  newspapers,   for\r\n\r\nconsiderable  profits, all at no risk,  in  little\r\n\r\ntime,  and  without much effort. It is a  sad  and\r\n\r\npainful example of how poorly we run some  of  our\r\n\r\nlimited companies listed on the stock exchange. We\r\n\r\nhave  to  acquire sophistication and expertise  to\r\n\r\nrun  large  corporate holding companies and  their\r\n\r\nsubsidiaries.  We must not allow  anyone  to  take\r\n\r\nsuch   easy   pickings.  We  believe   our   young\r\n\r\nexecutives  and  accountants have the  ability  to\r\n\r\nacquire this expertise quickly in the next five to\r\n\r\nten  years. We shall the more rapidly develop this\r\n\r\nexpertise  if we increase the number  of  our  own\r\n\r\nprofessionals  by attracting highly qualified  and\r\n\r\nable  professionals, who will  come  not  just  to\r\n\r\nwork, but also to settle permanently in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our way forward is clear. Through land\r\n\r\nreclamation,  effective  anti-pollution  measures,\r\n\r\ngood  zoning  and  planning,  we  can  develop   a\r\n\r\ngracious environment. Through family planning  and\r\n\r\na  combination  of incentives for small  families,\r\n\r\nand   disincentives  on  having  more  than  three\r\n\r\nchildren,  we shall keep the population growth  in\r\n\r\ncheck.  This  is the only way for the  quality  of\r\n\r\nlife  to go up. Food alone is not enough to  bring\r\n\r\nup  a  good  citizen. Every child needs care,  and\r\n\r\nyears  of  education  and training.  In  many  new\r\n\r\ncountries,  the population explosion  has  brought\r\n\r\nlife  down to the dirty ditches of the countryside\r\n\r\nor  the filth and squalor of the pavements in  the\r\n\r\ncities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fortunate that most of our people have\r\n\r\naccepted  the  realities of life  in  present  day\r\n\r\nSingapore.

The Anti-Pollution  Unit, which was set up last  year,  has\r\n\r\nundertaken    basic   air   pollution   monitoring\r\n\r\nthroughout Singapore. So far the monitoring  shows\r\n\r\nthat  air  pollution  levels are  not  yet  acute,\r\n\r\nalthough  they  are increasing in  the  industrial\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive and control measures include the\r\n\r\ncareful siting of industries.

Until  we\r\n\r\nare in a position to own and be able to manage and\r\n\r\noperate a far greater share of this wealth in  the\r\n\r\nnext  decade, the conditions for such rapid influx\r\n\r\nof  investment  and technology  will  have  to  he\r\n\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is conscious of the sacrifices\r\n\r\nand  contributions  made by labour  towards  rapid\r\n\r\neconomic  growth. Employers who have  been  making\r\n\r\nexceptional profits have been urged to give better\r\n\r\nbonuses    in   recognition   of   the    worker's\r\n\r\ncontribution to the present economic prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early next year, after the full effects of the\r\n\r\nrundown of the British bases have been assessed, a\r\n\r\nreview of the present wage policy will be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Central Provident Fund</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of contribution payable to the Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund has been increased from 5 per  cent\r\n\r\nto  6k per cent in 1968, from 6k per cent to 8 per\r\n\r\ncent  in  1970, and with effect from 1st  January,\r\n\r\n1971,  from 8 per cent to 10 per cent so that  the\r\n\r\ntotal rate payable by employees earning more  than\r\n\r\n$200  per  month is now 20 per cent of  wages.  In\r\n\r\naddition,   contributions  are  also  payable   on\r\n\r\nbonuses without any limit. Thus, whilst the policy\r\n\r\nof  wage  restraints still has to be  observed  in\r\n\r\nthis   early   stage  of  industrialisation,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   by  enhancing  C.P.F, contributions\r\n\r\npayable  by  employers and employees and  allowing\r\n\r\nsuch  C.P.F, contributions to  be  used  for  the\r\n\r\npurchase  of  Housing  and  Development  Board  or\r\n\r\nJurong  Town  Corporation flats, has ensured  more\r\n\r\nadequate  provision for workers in their old  age,\r\n\r\nand made home ownership possible for more and more\r\n\r\nworkers.  Today about 35,000 workers  own  or  are\r\n\r\npaying  instalments  to own  their  flats, it  is\r\n\r\nanticipated  that, as the Housing and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard   accelerates   its   building   programmes,\r\n\r\nthousands  of  more workers will be  able  to  own\r\n\r\ntheir flats for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Work Permit Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success in industrialisation has bro Light\r\n\r\nabout  an  acute  shortage of  skilled  and  semi-skilled  workers required for the  new  factories.\r\n\r\nUnless  we  are  able to train skilled  and  semi-skilled labour for our factories, the pace of  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  will  falter.  To  solve   this\r\n\r\nurgent  problem,  the  Ministry  has  issued  work\r\n\r\npermits  liberally  for  the  type  of  skills  we\r\n\r\nrequire. As on 30th June. 1971, a total of  55,800\r\n\r\nwork  permits  have been issued.  Also,  temporary\r\n\r\npermits  on a month-to-month basis in the form  of\r\n\r\nblock permits have been issued to non-citizens who\r\n\r\nare  engaged as construction workers. As  on  30th\r\n\r\nJune,  1971,  over 10,000 workers are  working  in\r\n\r\nSingapore under such an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrangement. In the next two years a  review  will\r\n\r\nbe  made on whether work permit holders should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  permanent residence and later  citizenship.\r\n\r\nIt  is also proposed to further simplify the issue\r\n\r\nof block permits for construction workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Apprenticeship and in-plant training schemes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This liberal work permit policy, however, is a\r\n\r\ntemporary  measure to meet a pressing problem.  In\r\n\r\nthe  long term, we are restructuring our education\r\n\r\nsystem  to give technical and vocational education\r\n\r\nthe  proper  emphasis and recognition demanded  by\r\n\r\nour  expanding  industrial and servicing  sectors.\r\n\r\nMore  intensive industrial training schemes,  such\r\n\r\nas  apprenticeship training and in-plant training,\r\n\r\nwill   be  needed.  Eventually,  Singapore  should\r\n\r\nsupply   most  of  the  skills  required  by   our\r\n\r\nindustries from our schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Protection of growing industrial work force</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater industrialisation, however, has been\r\n\r\naccompanied by an increasing number of  industrial\r\n\r\naccidents.  Apart from the financial loss  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy estimated at $23,000,000 for 1969, this is\r\n\r\nquite  unnecessary  and often avoidable  suffering\r\n\r\nfor  the  unfortunate victims and their  families.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry will be taking the following steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(i) Reorganisation and expansion  of  the  Factory Inspectorate</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factory Inspectorate will be expanded and\r\n\r\nstaffed  by  suitable officers to supervise  and\r\n\r\nenforce  industrial  safety  regulations.  These\r\n\r\nsafety  regulations  will be  strictly  enforced\r\n\r\nand  recalcitrant employers wilfully  neglecting\r\n\r\nthe  safety  and  health  of  workers  will   be\r\n\r\npunished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(ii) Amendments to the Factories Act</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Bill to amend the Factories Act will be\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  Parliament. The main  objectives\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill  are  to improve  the  health  and\r\n\r\nsafety  measures and the welfare  facilities  in\r\n\r\nthe interests of persons employed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  factories.  It  will also  encourage  a  more\r\n\r\nstringent observance of the safety provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  Factories Act by giving the Chief  Inspector\r\n\r\nof  Factories  greater powers and increasing  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  penalty under the Act. These  provisions\r\n\r\nwill  undoubtedly  help to  reduce  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iii) Building  Operations  and  Works of Engineering Construction Regulations</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has also gazetted in March 1971\r\n\r\nthe    Building   Operations   and   Works    of\r\n\r\nEngineering   Construction  Regulations,   1971,\r\n\r\nwhich   would   provide,  among  other   things,\r\n\r\ncomprehensive    measures    and    requirements\r\n\r\ndesigned  to safeguard the health and safety  of\r\n\r\nworkers   in   the   building  and   engineering\r\n\r\nconstruction  worksites,  which  have  accounted\r\n\r\nfor  the  highest number of industrial accidents\r\n\r\nin  recent  times. These Regulations  will  come\r\n\r\ninto   operation  after  their  adoption  by   a\r\n\r\nresolution in Parliament in the coming session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iv) Amendments to the Workmen's Compensation Act</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reinforce the above measures, the Ministry\r\n\r\nwill   also  introduce  a  Bill  to  amend   the\r\n\r\nWorkmen's  Compensation Act. The Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nextend  the  scope of workmen's compensation  to\r\n\r\ncover  non-manual workers who earn  up  to  $750\r\n\r\nper   month  (as  against  $400  per  month   at\r\n\r\npresent),  to  treble the quantum  of  workmen's\r\n\r\ncompensation payable at present and  to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  a  more  detailed list  of  injuries  which\r\n\r\nwould result in permanent partial incapacity  so\r\n\r\nthat  a more accurate assessment of compensation\r\n\r\nmay  be  made.  Also, two new diseases,  namely,\r\n\r\nsilicosis  and asbestosis, will be  included  in\r\n\r\nthe   schedule  of  occupational  diseases.  The\r\n\r\nAmendment  Bill is designed not only  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  workmen who sustain injuries in the course\r\n\r\nof   their   employment  are   more   adequately\r\n\r\ncompensated, but also, with the increased\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquantum of compensation,  to  induce  the\r\n\r\nemployers   to  institute  adequate  measures   to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  interest  and  welfare  of   their\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Protection of non-unionised workers</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, most employers have come to\r\n\r\nobserve  the  letter and spirit of the  Employment\r\n\r\nAct,  and  accord to their employees their  rights\r\n\r\nand  privileges as stipulated in the Act. However,\r\n\r\nthere  is a need to protect the interest of  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  the  non-unionised  workers,   mainly\r\n\r\nChinese-educated   employees,   in   the   smaller\r\n\r\nestablishments,   from   exploitation   by    some\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  employers.  For  this  purpose,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will expand the Labour Inspectorate  and\r\n\r\nalso  set up regional offices so that the  working\r\n\r\nconditions in these smaller establishments can  he\r\n\r\ninspected more frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Civil aviation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth rates of air traffic through Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  exceeded average international growth levels\r\n\r\nexpected  at 15 per cent a year. In the  past  two\r\n\r\nyears, passenger traffic at Paya Lebar Airport has\r\n\r\nbeen  growing at an average annual rate of 21  per\r\n\r\ncent.  Growth  of  air cargo is  more  rapid  with\r\n\r\naverage  annual increase of 42 per cent. Passenger\r\n\r\ntraffic  is  expected to grow  from  1.57  million\r\n\r\npassengers  in 1970 to 3.64 million passengers  in\r\n\r\n1975, to 15.6 million passengers in 1985 - a  ten-fold  increase.

Land is already  earmarked\r\n\r\nfor the second runway at Paya Lebar. But as Changi\r\n\r\nwould  be handed back to Singapore at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe  year,  the  Ministry  of  Communications   is\r\n\r\nstudying the feasibility of building the second\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrunway  at Changi, which can then be developed  as\r\n\r\nSingapore's second international airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides first-class hotels by international\r\n\r\nstandards, and scenic recreational centres such as\r\n\r\nS-ento-sa, the growth of\r\n\r\ntourism in Singapore will depend in\r\n\r\nrapid\r\n\r\nbegin by the Pro-large   measure   on  easy  air  connections   and\r\n\r\ninexpensive  fares.

Singapore's  national air-line  is  considering  the pu-rc-h-ase of the wide-bodied  jet\r\n\r\naircraft for operations in the near future.\r\n\r\nEncouragement   will   be   given   to   leading\r\n\r\ninternational aircraft manufacturing companies  to\r\n\r\nset up aerospace industries at Seletar and Changi,\r\n\r\nto  which  added racilities are being  considered.\r\n\r\nThe  establishnient of an Air  Academy  to  train\r\n\r\nflight  crew and technicians on a proper  co-ordinated  basis,  probably at  Seletar,  is  under\r\n\r\nconsideration  to  help the matipower  requirements  of  Singapore's airlines and the  aerospace\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public transportation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major overhaul of the public bus\r\n\r\ntransportation  system was successfully  completed\r\n\r\nafter some initial teething difficulties. 542 new\r\n\r\nbuses  were added, making a total of 1,816  public\r\n\r\nbuses.

The  Telecommunications  Department  is\r\n\r\nplanning  to  build another antenna  to  face  the\r\n\r\nPacific  Ocean.  The two satellite  earth  station\r\n\r\nantennae  will  put Singapore into  direct  space\r\n\r\ncommunication  with more than  two-thirds  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.

The\r\n\r\nTelecommunications Department  will  be  converted\r\n\r\ninto  a  statutory authority in April 1972.

More  deliveries\r\n\r\nwill  be  made  by  postmen  on  motorcycles   and\r\n\r\nscooters, instead of on bicycles or on foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation was introduced on 1st March 1971\r\n\r\nrequiring all high-rise residential and commercial\r\n\r\nbuildings,  including Government  buildings,  with\r\n\r\nmore than four storeys to provide letterboxes at a\r\n\r\ncentral point on the ground or first floor for the\r\n\r\ndelivery  of  letters  and  other  mail  to  their\r\n\r\ntenants.  Owners, or developers of existing  high-rise  buildings will be allowed up to  1st  March,\r\n\r\ni973   to  provide  such  letter-boxes  on   their\r\n\r\npremises.

New  policies\r\n\r\nwere  adopted in 1970 to ensure the continued  use\r\n\r\nof  Singapore as a trading and transhipment centre\r\n\r\nand to cater for the revolutionary changes in sea-borne  transportation. Current  major  development\r\n\r\nprojects  such as the container port project,  the\r\n\r\nprovision   of   more  warehousing  and   berthing\r\n\r\nfacilities, were re-examined. Several changes  had\r\n\r\nto  be  made.  For  example, the coming  of  third\r\n\r\ngeneration   container  vessels  has  necessitated\r\n\r\nseveral  changes  to the existing container  berth\r\n\r\ndesign. Plans to develop an inland container depot\r\n\r\nwere  mapped out. The Port of Singapore  Authority\r\n\r\nbegan  acquiring land for the purpose. At  Jardine\r\n\r\nSteps  an ocean terminal to accommodate facilities\r\n\r\nsuch as ferry services, as well as a cable car  to\r\n\r\nlink Sentosa, is being developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cargo handling was streamlined to enable a faster\r\n\r\nturn-round.  A reorganised labour force,  and  24-hour   service,  plus  better  use  of  equipment,\r\n\r\nimproved  efficiency, and increased  earnings  of\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seamen training facilities are to be expanded to\r\n\r\nprovide for better quality training. Multi-purpose\r\n\r\ntraining of crew is now necessary to man the  more\r\n\r\nmodern  ships  and give them higher  pay.  Present\r\n\r\nseamen will be given special retraining to upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir skills and pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A National Maritime Board is being formed to co-ordinate, promote and develop maritime employment,\r\n\r\ntraining and welfare. The proposed Maritime'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard will replace the four existing marine\r\n\r\nstatutory bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 30-6-71, there were 521 ships totalling\r\n\r\n742,894 gross tons flying the Singapore Flag. This\r\n\r\ncompares  with  377 ships totalling 319,675  gross\r\n\r\ntons  as on 30-6-69, an increase of 38.19 per cent\r\n\r\nand  132.39  per cent respectively. The  Singapore\r\n\r\nRegistry   offers  various  incentives,  including\r\n\r\nexemption from income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Pollution</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Environmental pollution is being checked. During\r\n\r\nthe year ended 31-3-71, a total of 32,680 vehicles\r\n\r\nwere  booked  for  excessive emission  of  exhaust\r\n\r\nsmoke.  The  campaign will continue. On  the  sea,\r\n\r\nstringent  measures were adopted by  the  Port  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Authority (P.S.A.) to control pollution\r\n\r\nof   our   waters.  New  harbour  safety  measures\r\n\r\ncombined with better surveillance were introduced.\r\n\r\nThe   P.S.A, will  be  setting  up  oil  disposal\r\n\r\nfacilities where ships may discharge slop. As  the\r\n\r\nAirport expands and the number of planes using  it\r\n\r\nincreases,  noise  pollution  becomes  more  of  a\r\n\r\nproblem.   It   is  not  possible  to   completely\r\n\r\neliminate noise. But measures are being  taken  to\r\n\r\nminimise   the  noise  pollution.  The   Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational  Airport runway  is  being  extended\r\n\r\nnorthwards  instead of southwards  so  that  noise\r\n\r\nnuisance  can be reduced. The possibility  of  re-routing  the landing and take-off paths  is  being\r\n\r\nstudied  to lower the noise problem for  the  more\r\n\r\npopulated areas of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Meteorology</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 10 cm, weather radar costing $500,000 was\r\n\r\ninstalled  at the Airport Operations  Building  of\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar Airport to replace an older equipment.\r\n\r\nThis  high  performance  radar  will  enable   the\r\n\r\nlocation  and tracking of storms and thunderclouds\r\n\r\nwithin  a radius of 250 miles. It also allows  the\r\n\r\nstudy  of  the  vertical structure  of  individual\r\n\r\nstorms. This radar is indispensable for short-term\r\n\r\nweather  forecasting and for quantitative rainfall\r\n\r\nmeasurements,  particularly during  the  Northeast\r\n\r\nmonsoon season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An automatic picture read-out station to obtain\r\n\r\ncloud photographs from weather satellites was  set\r\n\r\nup   at   the  Airport  in  December  1970.

This increase is largely  due  to\r\n\r\nthe  buoyancy  of  the  economy  and  to  specific\r\n\r\nmeasures that have been taken during the year  for\r\n\r\nmore   efficient  tax  collection.

For the  current\r\n\r\nfinancial   year  the  estimated  expenditure   is\r\n\r\n$1,306.8  million.

The Ministry  is  studying  the\r\n\r\nrecommendations and decisions on them will be made\r\n\r\nin the next few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the drudgery and monotony out of the\r\n\r\ntraditional labour-intensive system of  beats  and\r\n\r\npatrols,  a new system of mobile team policing  is\r\n\r\nbeing tried out in two divisions. This system will\r\n\r\ngive  the  men  on  patrol  greater  mobility  and\r\n\r\nconstant  radio contact with one another and  with\r\n\r\nthe divisional headquarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police has begun studying the pros and cons\r\n\r\nof  computerization of those areas of police  work\r\n\r\nwhich   have   been   computerized   in   advanced\r\n\r\ncountries.  With  the  assistance  of   the   Data\r\n\r\nProcessing  Department of MINDEF  the  Police  has\r\n\r\nembarked  on  a  programme no computerize  traffic\r\n\r\nrecords.  A  feasibility study  will  be  made  to\r\n\r\ncomputerize  the  processing of  traffic  records,\r\n\r\nsummonses,  warrants, and records in the  Criminal\r\n\r\nRecords Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has approached a friendly\r\n\r\ngovernment for experts to assist the Government in\r\n\r\nreorganizing and upgrading the Police Academy  and\r\n\r\nthe  C.I.D. The burgeoning economy and more better\r\n\r\neducated  criminally disposed youths have resulted\r\n\r\nin   a   higher   number  of   crimes   and   more\r\n\r\nsophistication  in the perpetration  of  them.  To\r\n\r\ncope  with this new situation, the police must  be\r\n\r\nequal  to the criminal in prevention and detection\r\n\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No amount of investigative aids, scientific\r\n\r\nequipment  and  gadgetry can be  effectively  used\r\n\r\nunless we have the right qualities in the officers\r\n\r\nwho make careers in the Police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C.I.D, will also have to be re-equipped to\r\n\r\nimprove  their  capacity for crime  investigation.\r\n\r\nThe  rudiments of a criminal intelligence  service\r\n\r\nwill   be   expanded  into  a  fully   operational\r\n\r\norganization.  The  feasibility  of   a   forensic\r\n\r\nlaboratory  in the Home Ministry is  under  study.\r\n\r\nSo,  too,  a  Narcotics Bureau to co-ordinate  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of the Police and Customs to prevent  the\r\n\r\ninflow of dangerous drugs into the Republic or the\r\n\r\nuse of the port as transhipment centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIts  first objective, however, must be to  nip  in\r\n\r\nthe  bud  any possibility of the spread  of  drug\r\n\r\naddiction in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Vigilante Corps</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An additional role of civil defence has been\r\n\r\nassigned to the Vigilante Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time national service in the Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps  has been re-scheduled into three phases  of\r\n\r\nfour  years  each  to provide  for  civil  defence\r\n\r\nservice  in the second four-year phase.
