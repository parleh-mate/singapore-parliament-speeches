The\r\n\r\nOpposition has met and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders  have  allocated amongst  themselves  the  time\r\n\r\nwhich  is  theirs which is 4\u00bd hours, leaving  half  an\r\n\r\nhour  to Government, which is the traditional procedure\r\n\r\nin  this matters. If the Leader of the House is of  the\r\n\r\nview   that  the  debate  on  the  Fifth  Supplementary\r\n\r\nEstimates would take so long as to eat into that  half-hour,  then the Opposition can meet and surrender  part\r\n\r\nof  its  4\u00bd hours.

That  means  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment Whip and the Opposition Whip - if there is  an\r\n\r\nOpposition  Whip - get together, decide as to  what  time\r\n\r\nshould  be made available to each other when  there  is\r\n\r\nlimited  time  available,  decide  on  the  number   of\r\n\r\nspeakers  and so on and so forth, so that the  business\r\n\r\non  which  there  is  a guillotine could  be  completed\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily to both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as our Standing Orders are concerned, the\r\n\r\nposition is that, ordinarily, the resumed debate on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion, \"That the Assembly approves the financial policy\r\n\r\nof  the Government for the year 1962\", should take from  3\r\n\r\np.m.  (not 2.30 p.m.) to 8 p.m. Ordinarily also, if  there\r\n\r\nis  other  business  of Supply, that  business  of  supply\r\n\r\nshould be taken on a separate allotted day. But there have\r\n\r\nbeen  cases  where it is anticipated that one business  of\r\n\r\nSupply  would  not take unduly long, and it has  been  the\r\n\r\npractice in the past for the type of motion which has been\r\n\r\nmoved  by the Leader of the House to be moved and accepted\r\n\r\nby  the  House.  I  think the Leader  of  the  House  will\r\n\r\nremember that there is an implicit understanding  that  if\r\n\r\nthe  first business of Supply enroaches on the time of the\r\n\r\nsecond business of supply, then he will undertake to move,\r\n\r\nat  the end of the day, the suspension of Standing Orders,\r\n\r\nso  that the time taken up by the first business of Supply\r\n\r\ncould  be  added  on to the time taken up  by  the  second\r\n\r\nbusiness  of  Supply  after 8 p.m.  That  is  roughly  the\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, it is not my intention to rob\r\n\r\nMembers of the Opposition of any time they wish to use  to\r\n\r\nspeak  during the course of this debate, but as  you  have\r\n\r\npointed  out, according to page 6 of the Standing  Orders,\r\n\r\nthere   is  a  footnote  down  there,  which  says   quite\r\n\r\ncorrectly:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The resumed Debate on the Annual Budget Statement or\r\n\r\nBusiness  of  Supply  is taken at 3 p.m. on  an  allotted\r\n\r\nday....'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now approximately at 2.44 p.m. If by 3 p.m. we do\r\n\r\nnot   finish   the  debate  on  the  Fifth   Supplementary\r\n\r\nEstimates, then at 3 p.m. we will automatically go  on  to\r\n\r\nthe  resumed  debate  on  the Budget  Statement.

I\r\n\r\nthink  there  is a point in the criticism made  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Tanglin. I must say I regret that a  fuller\r\n\r\nexplanation for asking this large amount was not  given\r\n\r\nin the Command Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say, however, that it is not true that this\r\n\r\nthing  is not usual. I am speaking from memory,  but  I\r\n\r\nthink it was in the year 1954 or 1956 thereabouts  when\r\n\r\nsimilar  transfers of sums were made from  the  revenue\r\n\r\nbalance  to  the  Development Fund.  Perhaps  I  should\r\n\r\nexplain  here  to Members who may not be familiar  with\r\n\r\nfinancial  procedure that we keep Government monies  in\r\n\r\ntwo  large  funds.  One is the Consolidated  Fund  into\r\n\r\nwhich  all  revenues  are paid and  against  which  all\r\n\r\ncurrent  expenditure is charged. The other one  is  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund which goes towards paying for projects\r\n\r\nin  the  Four-Year  Development Plan  approved  by  the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  The disbursement of money in the Development\r\n\r\nFund  is controlled by the Assembly itself, either year\r\n\r\nby  year,  or  by Supplementary Estimates as  the  need\r\n\r\narises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, briefly, the position is this. When we draw up\r\n\r\nthe Four-Year Development Plan, we not only set out the\r\n\r\nmajor  development projects which the  State  hoped  to\r\n\r\nundertake in the course of the next four years, but  we\r\n\r\nalso  made  a  calculation of the resources  that  were\r\n\r\navailable  then for meeting this rather  large  sum  of\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure. Copies of  this  blue  book  were\r\n\r\ncirculated to all Members in the House, and I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  the  Member  for  Tanglin  has  diligently\r\n\r\nperused  the  contents of this book. However,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to refresh his memory on this point. In Chapter  V\r\n\r\nof the Plan entitled \"Financing the Plan\", we described\r\n\r\nvarious  sources  of  finance such  as  surpluses  from\r\n\r\ncurrent revenue, the present financial resources of the\r\n\r\nGovernment, City Council Public Utilities, loans (World\r\n\r\nBank loans and loans raised locally), and so forth.  On\r\n\r\npage  47,  you  will see a recapitulation of  resources\r\n\r\navailable  at that time. They included a transfer  from\r\n\r\nthe   Consolidated  Revenue  Account,  which   is   the\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund, of $57.2 million, a transfer of  $20\r\n\r\nmillion  from the Contingency Fund/Advance Accounts,  a\r\n\r\nsum  of $9.4 million from unexpended loan proceeds; and\r\n\r\non  another page we stated that local loans would  have\r\n\r\nto  be raised of which about $50 million is expected to\r\n\r\nbe raised in the form of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreasury  bills. So these are the sums roughly  calculated\r\n\r\nin drawing up the Plan. These are the sums which represent\r\n\r\nthe financial resources initially available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you add the $57.2 million to be transferred from\r\n\r\nthe  Consolidated  Fund,  the $20 million  representing  a\r\n\r\nrunning down of the Advance Accounts, and the $9.4 million\r\n\r\nrepresenting the unexpended loan proceeds, you will get  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of,  I  make it, $87 million. Then, of  course,  we\r\n\r\nwanted  to  keep  a  part of the loans  to  be  raised  on\r\n\r\nTreasury  hills in long-term securities in the Development\r\n\r\nFund.  So  in  fact,  the  operation  to  be  carried  out\r\n\r\naccording  to  the Development Plan will  be  a  sum  much\r\n\r\nhigher  than $80 million. One of the reasons is  that  the\r\n\r\nvalue of Treasury bills floated in the market has not been\r\n\r\nas  much as we had hoped. So I limited this transfer  from\r\n\r\nthe  Consolidated  Fund  to the Development  Fund  to  $80\r\n\r\nmillion.  Of course, this is rather necessary because  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund itself is running down in spite  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that we floated a loan of $50 million this year.  By\r\n\r\nthe end of this year, we have our payments for development\r\n\r\nexpenditure  out of this Development Fund. We  may  get  a\r\n\r\ntotal of some $51 million as against $87 million which  we\r\n\r\nstarted  with at the beginning of this year. So  with  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of some $80 million to the Development Fund,  we\r\n\r\nwill  then get a fairly respectable figure of $171 million\r\n\r\nroughly  for  the Development Fund for use next  year.  We\r\n\r\nwill be making transfers from the Consolidated Fund to the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund as and when the need arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope my explanation is clear to the Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\nI  think  I do owe to Members of the House an apology  for\r\n\r\nnot setting it out in the Command Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\nrefer  the  Minister  for  Finance  to  page  49  of   his\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan. Paragraph 5.26 sets out the heads  under\r\n\r\nwhich  he proposes to finance tile Plan. $871 million  was\r\n\r\nthe total required to finance the Plan of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich he hoped to get $116.1 million from Revenue Surplus.\r\n\r\nNow  if  I understand Revenue Surplus correctly, it  means\r\n\r\nmoney  saved from revenue. For the year 1961, there was  a\r\n\r\nvote  of $30 million as contribution from revenue  to  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund.  In  the 1962  Estimates,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nfurther sum of $30 million by way of contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund. $30 million plus $30 million  makes  $60\r\n\r\nmillion.  Now  $80 million from current revenue  makes  it\r\n\r\n$140  million. Do I understand the Minister  to  say  that\r\n\r\nrevenue has exceeded his most sanguine hopes when he hoped\r\n\r\nto  finance the $871 million to the point of $116  million\r\n\r\nfrom revenue'?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is not the\r\n\r\nposition.

Have I made my\r\n\r\npoint clear?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> As I understand it from the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance, of the $116.1 million which he hoped to get  from\r\n\r\nRevenue  Surplus, the $80 million which he is  now  asking\r\n\r\nthe House would go towards part of that $116.1 million. He\r\n\r\nis now asking the House to vote another $80 million to the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund. I take it it is from Revenue Surplus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Perhaps he has got the book there.

And,\r\n\r\nof  course, we have floated Treasury bills, as we  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  part  of which proceeds we want to  put  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Do I understand the Hon, the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance to say this: that this $80 million then is  the\r\n\r\nsum  set out under \"Consolidated Revenue Account  $57.2\r\n\r\nmillion\"  and  the  sum  set out  against  \"Contingency\r\n\r\nFund/Advance   Accounts  $20  million\",  making   $77.2\r\n\r\nmillion.  That  is the amount he is now  asking  to  be\r\n\r\ntransferred to the Development Fund, and that this  $80\r\n\r\nmillion  is not from any surplus revenue for  the  year\r\n\r\n1961.

We\r\n\r\nare  well  aware of the entrepot nature of Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy.   We   are   aware  of  Singapore's   growing\r\n\r\npopulation.  We are aware and are keenly desirable  of\r\n\r\nindustrial peace, because this is closely tied up with\r\n\r\nthe  need for industrialisation upon which so much  of\r\n\r\nour  population  would depend for  jobs  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture. Sir, it is because of our consciousness of the\r\n\r\ndelicate  nature of our economy and the  magnitude  of\r\n\r\nour  problem  we  have to face that we  feel  the  co-operation  of the entire people is a prerequisite  for\r\n\r\nthe success of any government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is here that I have to remind the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment where they have blundered, namely, that  in\r\n\r\ntheir  budgeting, in their taxation policy,  in  their\r\n\r\nefforts to work out a policy of collection of revenue,\r\n\r\nand  in  their  order  of  priorities  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure of public needs, they do not seem to  have\r\n\r\ntaken  into  account the feelings and desires  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.

He justifies  his\r\n\r\nproposed  Budget by the assertion that expenditure  on\r\n\r\nvarious  items has been greater than that of preceding\r\n\r\nyears.  Sir, this is a rather naive way of  trying  to\r\n\r\nget  acceptance of Government's financial policy.  Our\r\n\r\nrevenues  have  increased, and so expenditure  of  our\r\n\r\nvarious  social  services has also increased  together\r\n\r\nwith the expenditure on various other items. There  is\r\n\r\nnothing new or startling in this simple fact. There is\r\n\r\nno  reason  for  the Minister for Finance  to  make  a\r\n\r\nspecial point of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I would.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, let me examine certain main\r\n\r\nfeatures  of the Minister's speech. The Minister  says\r\n\r\nthat  the  development expenditure for the  year  1961\r\n\r\nwould amount to $100-$110 million and, according to the\r\n\r\nMinister,  this  is an all-time record  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSir, is this really true? I do not think he dares even\r\n\r\nanswer that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 8 of the Development Estimates for 1962, the\r\n\r\ngrand total for 1961 quoted for development was $166.2\r\n\r\nmillion. Of this, how much is really going to be spent\r\n\r\nby  the end of the year? The estimated expenditure  is\r\n\r\nto  be  $107.8  million. Therefore, the Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  spend  only 65 per cent of  what  has  been\r\n\r\nallocated  for  development. But, unfortunately,  even\r\n\r\nthis amount would not be spent. Of the $107.8 million.\r\n\r\n$40 million is, in fact, a paper transfer. So actually\r\n\r\nthe amount to be spent by the end of 1962,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  indeed  that amount will be spent, will  be  $107.8\r\n\r\nmillion  minus $40 million, that is $67.8  million.  If\r\n\r\nyou  are  to  work  it out, this is only  41  per  cent\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is interesting to note that this $67.8\r\n\r\nmillion is much lower than the pre-P.A.P. years. It  is\r\n\r\nmuch  lower  than what the Lim Yew Hock Government  had\r\n\r\nspent. If you turn to page 25 of the Development  Plan,\r\n\r\nSir,   in   Table   2.11,  under  the  title   \"Capital\r\n\r\nExpenditure 1955-1960\", you will see under column 1955,\r\n\r\n(at  the  bottom  of  it); $89.2 million;  1956,  $83.9\r\n\r\nmillion; 1957, $118.4 million; 1958, the figure is also\r\n\r\n$118.4  million. But when it comes to  1959  and  1960,\r\n\r\nthere are only $73.5 million for 1959 and $66.6 million\r\n\r\nfor 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Gob, point of elucidation, if it is\r\n\r\nnot too lengthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, Sir.

These\r\n\r\nare   not  included  in  the  Government's  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates. The grand total includes various items.  Let\r\n\r\nus  take  the  first  two  lines  of  Table  2.11,  for\r\n\r\ninstance.  \"Transport and Communications\" includes  the\r\n\r\nTelephone Board. We are spending millions of dollars on\r\n\r\nsuch  items. \"Public utilities\" will include the  Power\r\n\r\nStation  at  Pasir  Panjang. This  is  not  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure of the Central Government with which we are\r\n\r\nconcerned in the Development Estimates before  us.

That was the essence  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  talk.  They became a lot  of  self-fancying\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second year, when they were running into\r\n\r\npolitical  difficulties, when they realised  that  they\r\n\r\nhad  to  show  something for having been  elected  into\r\n\r\noffice,  they  called it the year of  construction.  We\r\n\r\nhave already said that it was more a year of confusion.\r\n\r\nThe  taxes  on petrol and tobacco, increased rents  and\r\n\r\nnumerous  other hardships brought them little sympathy.\r\n\r\nInstead,  they persisted in their so-called tough  line\r\n\r\nin  the  belief that everybody would support  them,  as\r\n\r\nthere was no other viable Left-wing force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Four-Year Development Plan was rushed\r\n\r\nthrough  in view of the Hong Lim by-election. Sir,  any\r\n\r\nplan that advances the interest of the people, any plan\r\n\r\nthat  brings  greater amenities and comforts,  must  be\r\n\r\nsupported.  Sir,  the  trade  unions  and  many  others\r\n\r\nsupported this plan. But it is one thing to draw  up  a\r\n\r\nplan and another thing to implement it. The Government\r\n\r\nhad  to draw up the plan if only to prove to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore that it was doing something for them. But\r\n\r\nunfortunately, at the same time, it was  also  carrying\r\n\r\nout  policies which made it difficult for  the  people,\r\n\r\nespecially for the poor men, in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall picture is as follows. The P.A.P. plans\r\n\r\nto spend in the year of construction $166.4 million. Of\r\n\r\nthis  amount,  $40 million was to be  a  grant  to  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board.\r\n\r\nThis  $40  million, we are told, is the  amount  spent.\r\n\r\nBut,  in fact, it is a mere paper transfer. It has only\r\n\r\nbeen effected on paper. It has not been translated into\r\n\r\nterms of actual development. That is, it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas not been used for the purpose it was given. Nothing\r\n\r\nof  this  money has been spent in the sense  used.  The\r\n\r\nmoney re-means invested in Britain. The only difference\r\n\r\nis  that, instead of this money being held in the  name\r\n\r\nof  the Accountant-General, it is now probably held  in\r\n\r\nthe  name of the Economic Development Board. Therefore,\r\n\r\nto  get  a correct measure of the achievements  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. in its so-called year of construction, one  has\r\n\r\nto  deduct  the $40 million which is still invested  in\r\n\r\nBritain. You will therefore see, Mr Speaker, that only\r\n\r\n$67.8  million would be used by the end  of  the  year,\r\n\r\ngiving  the P.A.P. Government approximately  a  41  per\r\n\r\ncent  fulfilment. Is this not a true reflection of what\r\n\r\nhas been carried out by the Government? As I have said,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, of this $67.8 million, $34 million was  a\r\n\r\ngrant to the Housing Development Board. Even if we  are\r\n\r\nto  assume that all the money has been used or will  be\r\n\r\nused  by the end of the year, the achievements  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  in services other than public housing,  are  a\r\n\r\ncomplete and utter failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of the $92.2 million budgeted for\r\n\r\nuse in 1961, only $33.8 million is expected to be used.\r\n\r\nThat  is,  calculated at the very most, a 37  per  cent\r\n\r\nfulfilment  of  what was expected.

In\r\n\r\n1959,  when the P.A.P. took office, there was a  collapse\r\n\r\nof   development   expenditure.  The  Government   and\r\n\r\nstatutory bodies spent $45 million less than  in  1958,\r\n\r\nwhen the Labour Front was in office. This can easily be\r\n\r\nseen  from the Development Plan, page 25. You take  the\r\n\r\ncolumns  1958 and 1959. Subtract 73.5 from  118.4,  and\r\n\r\nyou  get 45. If you go further from the figure  in  the\r\n\r\n1960 estimates, you will see that only $11.1 million of\r\n\r\nthe  $41.7 million was spent. This only constitutes  21\r\n\r\nper  cent of the development expenditure in 1959.  Most\r\n\r\nof  this  was  probably spent before  the  P.A.P. took\r\n\r\noffice.  In 1960, the supposed year of construction  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P., development expenditure was supposed to  be\r\n\r\n$105.8  million.  That can be seen in  the  Development\r\n\r\nBudget  of  1960, page 467. State Development Projects - $105.8  million.  The 1961 Estimates presented  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse  are very significantly silent on the performance\r\n\r\nof  1960. There is no column, Sir, which gives you  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure for 1960. We have been told of acute needs.\r\n\r\nOne   has  only  to  read  the  first  chapter  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Four-Year Development Plan to see that  year\r\n\r\nafter year, very little has happened. All we get is how\r\n\r\nmuch better than others the P.A.P. is in doing nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> You must be blind!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What has happened to the money\r\n\r\nthat is not being used?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Put into his pocket!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All that has happened is that our\r\n\r\ninvestments in Britain are increasing.

It has been a cardinal principle\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P.'s election platform to try and encourage\r\n\r\ninvestment  in  industries from capital available  from\r\n\r\nlocal sources. Let me quote again The Tasks Ahead, Part\r\n\r\n1,  page  25 - I will read this little bit;  it  is  very\r\n\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. profoundly disagrees that the survival of\r\n\r\nSingapore  depends  on  foreign  capital  and   foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists.  We say that there are more than  adequate\r\n\r\ncapital  resources initially available locally. Indeed,\r\n\r\nthe  position is that large sums of local  capital  are\r\n\r\nbeing   invested   in  foreign  countries,   often   in\r\n\r\nunprofitable investments. The total amount of Singapore\r\n\r\ncapital invested by banks, insurance companies, central\r\n\r\ngovernment, local authorities and the public boards  is\r\n\r\nnot  known with certainty. It is probably in the region\r\n\r\nof $800,000,000. It is absolute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnonsense to say that our survival depends on foreigners\r\n\r\nwhen  so much of our own capital is invested in foreign\r\n\r\ncountries.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And one more paragraph, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Foreign business concerns which wish to establish\r\n\r\nfactories   in   Singapore  will  be  given   all   the\r\n\r\nencouragement and assistance they need. We  shall  give\r\n\r\nthem  guarantees  in  regard to  security  of  capital,\r\n\r\nremittance  of  dividends and other matters  which  all\r\n\r\nmodern governments regard as normal practice. But  [and\r\n\r\nthis  is the significant paragraph] it would be foolish\r\n\r\nto  imagine that, whatever we do, foreign capital  will\r\n\r\ncome in on the scale needed to solve our problems.  Our\r\n\r\nsalvation lies in our own hands.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I will finish the paragraph, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There are no benevolent foreigners knocking around\r\n\r\nthe  world,  anxious  to  discharge  these  duties  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities which are rightly our own. Let us  not\r\n\r\nface  the economic problems in the era of freedom  with\r\n\r\nthe mental attitudes appropriate to colonial servitude.\r\n\r\nLet   us  never  forget  that  self-government  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  without self-reliance. This is true  both  in\r\n\r\npolitics as well as in economics.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That is the quotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what has the Government done to encourage local\r\n\r\nbusiness  to  invest in industry? There is  hardly  any\r\n\r\nmention of this fact in the speech of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance. Are we to understand that the P.A.P. no longer\r\n\r\nbelieves  that  capital for investment is  to  be  made\r\n\r\navailable from local sources?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget that has been presented to us here\r\n\r\nhas been a balanced one. Government is not expected  to\r\n\r\nhave  a deficit and, in fact, deficit financing is  not\r\n\r\npart  of  Government's policy. In fact, I will even  go\r\n\r\nfurther and say that with savings that would be made in\r\n\r\neach Ministry every year we would again have a surplus.\r\n\r\nSir,  being  in this comfortable position of  having  a\r\n\r\nsurplus,  I  would  urge  that  the  Government  should\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  providing  greater  amenities  to  the\r\n\r\npoorer  sections  of the community - water,  electricity,\r\n\r\nhealth  services  to the city population,  and  similar\r\n\r\namenities and better transport facilities to the  rural\r\n\r\npopulation. We have been told that development projects\r\n\r\nhave  been  held  back  because  of  the  shortage   of\r\n\r\nengineers, architects and quantity surveyors. Sir,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. suffered  a loss of trained personnel  when  it\r\n\r\ncame  into  office. A greater loss was  suffered  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the cut in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvariable  allowances which was, Sir, a naive  political\r\n\r\ngimmick on the part of the Minister for Finance  trying\r\n\r\nto  convince  the people of Singapore  that  the  upper\r\n\r\nstrata  of the civil service were overpaid. Sir,  I  do\r\n\r\nnot wish to enter into arguments about whether they are\r\n\r\nor  they are not overpaid, but the simple fact is that,\r\n\r\nas  a  result,  we have had a shortage of  technicians,\r\n\r\nwhich  in  turn has affected our development programme.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  it is the workers and  the  ordinary\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore who have suffered from this  blind\r\n\r\nand  narrow-minded policy effected by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance who was himself once a civil servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has admitted that\r\n\r\ndelays  in implementing the development programme  have\r\n\r\nbeen due to the shortage of these architects, engineers\r\n\r\nand  quantity  surveyors. He should have  foreseen  the\r\n\r\nresult of his own actions. He should have foreseen that\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore are the ones who would  suffer\r\n\r\nby  this naive and shortsighted policy of his. He is  a\r\n\r\nman  who  talks  about realities and  he  has  shown  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  lack  of a sense of realism in  his  previous\r\n\r\nconduct.  Only  now,  Sir, is  there  some  glimmer  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility and realism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I\r\n\r\nam  glad  to note that the Minister for Finance  admits\r\n\r\nthat  this  is  principally due to  unfilled  posts - the\r\n\r\nsenior and ancillary grades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this situation would never have arisen if the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had adopted a more enlightened policy  from\r\n\r\nthe  beginning and had foreseen the effects of the  pay\r\n\r\ncuts upon the civil servants.

But I hope, after all these disputes\r\n\r\nand adversities of the Government, it has learnt to  be\r\n\r\nmore tolerant to our comments and sound criticisms. No\r\n\r\ndoubt  our  criticisms last year  on  the  Government's\r\n\r\nBudget policy were valid because due to our criticisms,\r\n\r\nmany  of the taxes which were to be imposed were  never\r\n\r\nimposed  at  all.  The business registration  tax,  the\r\n\r\nprofession-al  tax  and a few other  minor  taxes  were\r\n\r\nnever carried out. The pay cuts were restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps it is pertinent at this juncture for me\r\n\r\nto  make  a brief comment on the financial and economic\r\n\r\npolicies of this Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will talk about the fiscal policies of this\r\n\r\nGovernment.  From  the beginning  when  the  Government\r\n\r\nassumed  office, it was quite clear to us that  it  was\r\n\r\nbent  on  a  taxation policy of soaking the  poor.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we have a very good economist who  never\r\n\r\nbothers  to  take  advice from his  colleagues  on  his\r\n\r\nfinancial policies, and that is why he lands himself in\r\n\r\nsuch a mess today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many of the measures introduced - the\r\n\r\ntaxes  introduced - were to soak the rich, were  to  soak\r\n\r\nthe poor.

Since\r\n\r\nJune 1959, this Government has introduced 12 new taxes.\r\n\r\nIn  the 1961 Budget these 12 new taxes in my estimation\r\n\r\nwill  yield  approximately $45 million. Most  of  these\r\n\r\nmillions  will  be squeezed, cent by  cent,  dollar  by\r\n\r\ndollar, from the poor, from the wage earners, from  the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers,  from the taxi-drivers  and  the  hawkers,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  working population, from the  small  private\r\n\r\ncompanies run by local merchants. An estimated $100,000\r\n\r\nout  of  the  $45 million is all the contribution  this\r\n\r\nGovernment has asked from the big European firms  which\r\n\r\ncontrol our economy and make most of the profits. These\r\n\r\nEuropean firms in my opinion make at least half of  the\r\n\r\nprofits of Singapore, and are asked by this [so-called]\r\n\r\n\"Socialist\" Government to contribute less  than  1  per\r\n\r\ncent of the $45 million; to be exact .002 per cent.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is, in essence, the taxation policy of this\r\n\r\nGovernment.  During  the past 2\u00bd years,  its  taxation\r\n\r\npolicy  was a failure and that is why now it  dare  not\r\n\r\nintroduce  any more new taxes. Its economic policy  was\r\n\r\nalso  a  failure. We see very few industries being  set\r\n\r\nup.  We see the growing problem of unemployment. We see\r\n\r\na  shrinking  economy, and that is partly  due  to  the\r\n\r\nfailings of the financial and economic policies of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. assumed office, we were faced with a\r\n\r\ndeflationary situation, i.e. business was bad and\r\n\r\neconomic conditions were bad. Normally, during such\r\n\r\ntimes, what the government should do is not to impose\r\n\r\nany new taxes but to use whatever reserves it has - up to\r\n\r\na reasonable safe margin - and spend it on capital\r\n\r\nprojects or other projects. Because the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance refused to give the money, and I cannot print\r\n\r\nthe currency notes myself -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You chased away all the\r\n\r\narchitects!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will come to\r\n\r\nthe point of architects later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of not imposing new taxes and investing more\r\n\r\nin  the  economy and encouraging the volume of spending\r\n\r\nin  the country, what the Government did was to squeeze\r\n\r\nmore  from  the  public, particularly from  the  poorer\r\n\r\nsections  of the community to whom one cent means  one\r\n\r\ncent.  And on top of that, to stop spending.  We  could\r\n\r\nsee, during the first two years before the Hong Lim  by\r\n\r\nelection, there was very little construction - not  to\r\n\r\nsay S.I.T. houses, but schools and other projects which\r\n\r\nwere  very  few.  The  Hong  Lim  by-election  was  the\r\n\r\nwatershed of Government's economic and fiscal policies.\r\n\r\nOnly  then did it realise that it had made mistakes  in\r\n\r\nthose policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to explain, briefly, the\r\n\r\neffect   of  the  failing  of  the  policies   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment. For instance, if a taxi-driver earns $200 a\r\n\r\nmonth  and  if  the Government takes $20 from  him,  he\r\n\r\nwould  have  $20 less to spend. This would  affect  the\r\n\r\nhawkers  and  would,  in  turn,  affect  the  vegetable\r\n\r\nfarmers, the shopkeepers and the wholesale dealers. The\r\n\r\nreaction   would  be  more  than  the  $20  which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is  taking  from  the  poor   taxi-driver.\r\n\r\nInstead, the Government, in addition to that, not  only\r\n\r\nimposes   a   tax  on  the  poor,  but  also  restricts\r\n\r\nadditional  expenditure on the building of  houses  and\r\n\r\nschools.  For  instance, if the  Government  had  spent\r\n\r\nmoney  on  the  building of houses, schools  and  other\r\n\r\ncapital projects, this money would have been circulated\r\n\r\nin  the community. There would have been more jobs  for\r\n\r\nthe unemployed. The unemployed would have been able  to\r\n\r\nbuy  more vegetables so that the money would go to  the\r\n\r\nhawkers  and  shops,  and more money  would  have  been\r\n\r\ncirculated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not all. In addition what the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  did was to borrow, and borrow at  6  per  cent\r\n\r\ninterest; and if I am not wrong, just keep the money in\r\n\r\nthe bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are wrong.

We  all\r\n\r\nknow  of  the complete flop of the Industrial Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard.  I  think we must pass a law to make  sure  that\r\n\r\npersons  who  are to promote industries must  at  least\r\n\r\nhave  the  minimum practical experience  of  running  a\r\n\r\nsmall kachang puteh shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, armchair theoreticians who do not\r\n\r\nknow  how  to operate a cash register are not good  for\r\n\r\nthe  promotion  of industries. In my  view,  there  are\r\n\r\nthree basic conditions for the industrialisation  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry.  First of all, we must have the  entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nand  skilled labour. Second, we must have the available\r\n\r\ncapital.  And third, we must have a wide enough  market\r\n\r\nfor  the goods to be sold. In this respect, it must  be\r\n\r\nadmitted that Hongkong was and is in a better and  more\r\n\r\nadvantageous  position  than Singapore.  On  the  first\r\n\r\ncondition of skilled entrepreneurs and skilled workmen,\r\n\r\nHongkong has an advantage of having an influx of people\r\n\r\nfrom  Shanghai,  which  is  an  industrially  developed\r\n\r\ncountry, and other cities of China when the Nationalist\r\n\r\nregime  fell  in China. These people went to  Hong-Kong\r\n\r\nwith  their  available  capital. The  entrepreneurs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   are   not   industrial  entrepreneurs   but\r\n\r\ncommercial  entrepreneurs.  It  is  very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nconvince  the commercial entrepreneurs, who want  quick\r\n\r\nreturns, to invest their money in industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second problem is the question\r\n\r\nof  capital.  We know there is enough capital  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  to start new industries. As a matter of  fact,\r\n\r\nmuch  of  this capital has gone over to the Federation,\r\n\r\nor   even   overseas,  to  be  invested  in  commercial\r\n\r\nenterprises or stocks and shares. There is no  shortage\r\n\r\nof  capital  in  Singapore to be  channelled  into  any\r\n\r\nindustrial  enterprises,  if sufficient  inducement  is\r\n\r\ngiven..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, it is the question of market. Unless\r\n\r\nthere is a sufficiently big market for the sale of  our\r\n\r\nmanufactured  products,  few  industries   will   start\r\n\r\nenterprises  in  Singapore. If an  industry  starts  in\r\n\r\nMalaya,  it is assured of at least an eight million  to\r\n\r\nten  million population as its market. But if the  same\r\n\r\nindustry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis operated in Singapore, it can be assured of only two\r\n\r\nor three million population as its market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has not been successful in its\r\n\r\ncommon  market  talks. During the  merger  debate,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  not  convinced us that  its  so-called\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals  will  bring  the  common  market  to\r\n\r\nfruition.  We  hope that later, when the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  gives  his reply, he will  tell  us  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened  to the common market proposals in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper. Will there be a common market?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, three basic conditions are necessary for the\r\n\r\nsuccessful operation of industries. Firstly,  available\r\n\r\ncapital.  What has the Government done?  Has  it  done\r\n\r\nanything to induce it to go into these industries?  No.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  a  common  market. Has the  Government  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful in achieving a common market? As far  as  we\r\n\r\ncan  see,  also no. Thirdly, skilled entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\nskilled  workmen.  Has the Government  been  trying  to\r\n\r\nobtain  skilled entrepreneurs and skilled workmen  from\r\n\r\nother  places  in order to fill the gap?  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, it is no use telling a businessman who has been  a\r\n\r\ncommission agent or who runs a trading house to start a\r\n\r\nfactory   because  he  does  not  know  how  a  factory\r\n\r\noperates.  The  Government must provide  him  with  the\r\n\r\nrequisite  industrial entrepreneurs and  the  requisite\r\n\r\nskilled  workmen - at  least the  foreman - to  start  the\r\n\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Government has done is not industrialisation\r\n\r\nbut  producing  paper  plans, blue  prints  and  United\r\n\r\nNations missions. I do not say they are valueless. But\r\n\r\ntoo   many  missions  without  practical  results,   or\r\n\r\nfantastic schemes like the iron and steel mill  do  not\r\n\r\nlead us anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a known fact that if we can\r\n\r\nhave   a   steel  mill  in  Singapore,  we  can  create\r\n\r\nemployment for perhaps 80,000 people. That is more than-the   figure  of  the  present  unemployed  and \r\n\r\nunder-employed.  But  let us face facts. Is a  steel  mill  a\r\n\r\nreality? Can it be successful? Mr Speaker, Sir,  where\r\n\r\nare we going to get the coal? Is it from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndonesia?

The Federation of Malaya and Singapore\r\n\r\ntogether are not a big enough market for a steel  mill.\r\n\r\nWhat   should  be  done  is  that,  instead  of  having\r\n\r\npreposterous  schemes,  we should  come  down  to  hard\r\n\r\nfacts,  we should come down to earth, and the practical\r\n\r\nrealities  of industrialisation. Concentrate  on  small\r\n\r\nindustries - cottage industry, small industry or  medium\r\n\r\nindustry. But not on gigantic proposals as steel mills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's taxation policy\r\n\r\nhas  been  a failure. The Government's economic  policy\r\n\r\nhas  been a failure.

The Board expects to meet  its\r\n\r\nfuture target of 10,000 homes a year well in advance of\r\n\r\nits  time-table. The end of next year will see the  end\r\n\r\nof the long and frustrating years of waiting for decent\r\n\r\nhomes  by more than 10,000 families on the register  of\r\n\r\napplicants.  Some  have waited for six  or  even  eight\r\n\r\nyears.  By next year there will be a home for each  one\r\n\r\nof  these families, and at rents they can afford.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  record  achievement in the provision  of  public\r\n\r\nhousing  and can be claimed as a major success  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government. The achievement  is  all  the  more\r\n\r\nremarkable  if  we bear in mind that  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board had to start with what was  left  of\r\n\r\nthe wreckage of the former S.I.T.' \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nmust  admit that the only sphere of public construction\r\n\r\nwhere  the Government has been successful in  the  past\r\n\r\none year or since the Hong Lim by-election has been  in\r\n\r\nthe construction of S.I.T. flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Four-Year Plan. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  Four-Year Plan,  at  page  35,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has provided $206.86 million for  1961.  In\r\n\r\nthe  Budget speech of the Minister for Finance, he says\r\n\r\nthat  in  1961  the Government will spend only  between\r\n\r\n$100  and $110 million. Mr Speaker, Sir, $110  million\r\n\r\nout  of  $206 million. This is about half  of  it.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment can spend only half of what it has provided.\r\n\r\nNow,  Sir,  this  is  a  very clear  example  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot satisfactorily carry out the  public\r\n\r\nprojects it has announced. The only sphere of operation\r\n\r\nwhere  it  was  relatively  successful  was  in  public\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I rather suspect that Members have\r\n\r\nnot understood the figures with which they are dealing.\r\n\r\nMay  I  explain that the $206.86 million on page 35  of\r\n\r\nthe Development Plan refers to development projects  in\r\n\r\nthe  whole  State,  including those undertaken  by  the\r\n\r\npublic utilities, such as electricity, water, gas,  the\r\n\r\nTelephone Board, the Harbour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard  and so on?

Just now the Minister said that  there\r\n\r\nwere  no architects. Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that\r\n\r\nthe main architects who are now building houses for the\r\n\r\nGovernment are the architects I recruited when  I  took\r\n\r\nover  the  S.I.T.

We are also glad  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  seen its errors  and  has  decided  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw the business registration tax and other taxes.\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  feel  that  these  measures in themselves  are  not\r\n\r\nsufficient.

There  are  many  other  taxes   which   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has imposed during its two years of  office.\r\n\r\nWe  hope  the Minister for Finance will review some  of\r\n\r\nthem and see what measures can be taken to rectify some\r\n\r\nof the mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we also hope that in the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  these S.I.T. houses  (the  Government\r\n\r\nhave  said that these will be constructed at rents that\r\n\r\npeople  can afford), they will carry out what has  been\r\n\r\npromised,  because,  as far as we  know,  many  of  the\r\n\r\npresent  flats are being offered to the public  at  too\r\n\r\nhigh  rents. If I am not mistaken, there are still many\r\n\r\nflats at present vacant and the Government is going out\r\n\r\nof  its way to offer them to other applicants. Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhope   the   Government  will  not  only  introduce   a\r\n\r\nstandstill  Budget, but will take certain  measures  to\r\n\r\nrectify some of its past mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the first time\r\n\r\nthe Government has presented to the House an integrated\r\n\r\nBudget.  When  I  say an integrated Budget,  I  mean  a\r\n\r\nBudget  which  concerns  not  only  what  normally   is\r\n\r\naccepted  as  Government items but also includes  items\r\n\r\nwhich  were  in the City Council Budget. Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, as the Water, Gas  and  Electricity\r\n\r\nDepartments,  being  the  trading  departments,   still\r\n\r\nremain  technically and legally with the City  Council,\r\n\r\nit  has  not been possible for the Minister to  include\r\n\r\nthem in the State\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBudget. However, I have been trying to find out whether\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council has published its 1962  Budget.  The\r\n\r\nsources  of  my information - I hope they are  correct,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir - say that such a budget has not  yet\r\n\r\nbeen  published. I hope I am right in that  surmise.  I\r\n\r\nwas hoping, Mr Speaker, Sir, that something would have\r\n\r\nbeen said by the City Council on what it is going to do\r\n\r\nfor  the  year 1962, because, in my opinion,  what  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council  does  in the matter of  electricity  and\r\n\r\nwater  is particularly pertinent to what the Government\r\n\r\nhopes  to  achieve  in the years  1962  and  1963,  and\r\n\r\nthereafter in matters of industrialisation, housing and\r\n\r\nsuch other public projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government hopes to start its Jurong project, if\r\n\r\nI remember correctly, sometime towards the end of 1962.\r\n\r\nIt  thinks  something  in the way of  industrialisation\r\n\r\nshould be started in Jurong. If I remember the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance correctly, his scheme for Jurong was that a\r\n\r\nsteel  mill  would initially be established and  around\r\n\r\nthat a steel mill would centre private enterprise which\r\n\r\nwould  base its activities on the products of the  mill\r\n\r\nitself.  I understand, Mr Speaker, Sir, that before  a\r\n\r\nsteel mill can operate satisfactorily, it needs quite a\r\n\r\nsupply   of  water.  Unless  this  supply  is   readily\r\n\r\navailable, and available on all possible occasions - whether it is a dry spell or a wet spell - the activities\r\n\r\nof  this mill cannot be carried on. If ever a period of\r\n\r\nmonths during the year the mill had to cease to operate\r\n\r\nbecause  of  a water shortage, the whole project  would\r\n\r\nbecome  uneconomic. Therefore, it is pertinent to  know\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Government intends to do in  the  matter  of\r\n\r\nwater  supply. I believe water and electricity are  now\r\n\r\nthe  ministerial responsibility of the Hon, the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister. I hope he will, in his reply, tell the  House\r\n\r\nwhat is Government's intention. If I remember correctly\r\n\r\nagain,  Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister, in answer\r\n\r\nto one of the questions put in this House, said that it\r\n\r\nwas  the  intention of Government to go to  the  Scudai\r\n\r\nRiver  before it goes to the Johore River and  that  it\r\n\r\nhopes to spend $20 million on the Scudai River\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscheme, as a result of which it hopes to bring water to\r\n\r\nSingapore within two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is unfortunate that that scheme is\r\n\r\nnot  in  the  Budget. If it had been in the  Budget  it\r\n\r\nwould  have  been  subject  to  the  scrutiny  of   the\r\n\r\nEstimates  Committee where the whole scheme could  have\r\n\r\nbeen carefully examined on the basis of whether it was,\r\n\r\nin  fact, necessary for such a scheme to be implemented\r\n\r\nbefore the Government goes to the Johore River. I  have\r\n\r\na little\r\n\r\nexperience of these matters, Mr Speaker, Sir,  and  my\r\n\r\nown  considered opinion is that it is an absolute waste\r\n\r\nof  public  money  to go to Scudai now  and  spend  $20\r\n\r\nmillion there, while going to Johore at the same  time.\r\n\r\nI  sincerely hope that before the Government embarks on\r\n\r\nsuch  a  scheme, it will reconsider the position.  From\r\n\r\nthe  point of view of the Opposition - at least from  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  view  of the Alliance - I  hope  it  will  be\r\n\r\npossible  for the Government to consult the  Opposition\r\n\r\nbefore it embarks on such a scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, part of our trouble over the water\r\n\r\nsupply  has  been due to the fact that during  the  dry\r\n\r\nweather the flow of these rivers dries up. We get quite\r\n\r\na  bit  of our supply from the Tebrau River. Now,  when\r\n\r\nthe  dry weather sets in, the flow of the Tebrau  River\r\n\r\ncomes  almost to a standstill, and naturally  water  is\r\n\r\nscarce.  Scudai,  Mr Speaker, Sir, is  another  stream\r\n\r\nwhich is subject to a dry weather flow. During the  wet\r\n\r\nweather,  of course, it runs fast and high. But  during\r\n\r\nthe  dry seasons, it runs dry and slow. I am suggesting\r\n\r\nto  the  Government that the water supply of  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould not be dependent on streams which are subject to\r\n\r\na  dry weather flow. The expert advice is that if we go\r\n\r\nto  Johore  even  at  its  driest,  it  will  carry   a\r\n\r\nsufficient capacity for it to give a sufficient  supply\r\n\r\nof water to Singapore, both for domestic and industrial\r\n\r\nuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the City Council would have gone to the Johore\r\n\r\nRiver  long ago, but unfortunately it was not  possible\r\n\r\nfor  the City Council to do so because the Johore River\r\n\r\nScheme was then centred\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  an  area  which  was subject to  military  control.\r\n\r\nBecause of Communist and other activities in that area,\r\n\r\nthe  City  Council was not allowed to go  in  there  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out the scheme. When it became possible to carry\r\n\r\nout  the  Johore River Scheme, the Council had  already\r\n\r\nembarked  on  Tebrau, and, therefore, was committed  to\r\n\r\nTebrau.  Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, let us  not  make\r\n\r\nthe  same mistake - it was not a mistake then. We had  to\r\n\r\ndo  it  then. Let us therefore not go to Scudai now  to\r\n\r\nsupplement Tebrau and then go to Johore which will give\r\n\r\nus  a full supply all the time for all the years yet to\r\n\r\ncome.  I  do  hope, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  before  the\r\n\r\nGovernment goes to Scudai, it will consider the  scheme\r\n\r\nvery  carefully before it spends $20 million on such  a\r\n\r\nscheme  which eventually must come to nought after  the\r\n\r\nJohore River Scheme has come to fruition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to hear from the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance what definite plans the Government\r\n\r\nhas  afoot  in the matter of going to the Johore  River\r\n\r\nfor  a  supply of water. My own information, Sir,  for\r\n\r\nwhat  it  is  worth - it may be incorrect - is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is not ready even now on the  Johore  River\r\n\r\nScheme. It is still floundering. Did it sent the  Water\r\n\r\nEngineer  to  Europe to look for water or to  look  for\r\n\r\nmoney. I think it might have done better for itself  if\r\n\r\nit had sent him to the Johore River to see how best and\r\n\r\nhow  quickly  he  could  carry  out  that  scheme.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   if  the  Government   is   sincerely\r\n\r\ninterested  in  getting water from  Johore  within  two\r\n\r\nyears, I will tell the Government how to do it. It  can\r\n\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It can be done, Sir.

The people who are  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of the water supply of Singapore know  it,  but\r\n\r\nwill  not go to them for that advice and for that help.\r\n\r\nIf that is correct, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is criminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the other point on which I wish to\r\n\r\ntouch  is  the  question of the electricity  supply  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  also  understand - here  again  I   speak\r\n\r\nwithout  absolute knowledge; this is what I  hear  from\r\n\r\nsources which I think can be relied upon - that so far as\r\n\r\nour  electricity supply is concerned, we  have  reached\r\n\r\nthe  end. The peak load is now such that with  all  our\r\n\r\ngenerators  going at Pasir Panjang, we can  just  about\r\n\r\nmake  it.  I  also understand that for some  reason  or\r\n\r\nother St. James Power Station is not working. Why  that\r\n\r\nis so, I do not know. I have been told the reasons, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, but I have not confirmed them,  so  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  mention them to the House.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister might tell us why it is that after  so\r\n\r\nmany  millions of dollars have been spent on St.  James\r\n\r\nPower  Station,  it  is  not  operating  today,  hereby\r\n\r\nplacing a heavier burden on Pasir Panjang. The position\r\n\r\nin Pasir Panjang is that one generator is always out of\r\n\r\nfunction - it has to be. And if one generator should fail\r\n\r\naccidentally, then we would be in for blackouts  again.\r\n\r\nSo  perhaps the Minister for Finance will let  us  know\r\n\r\nwhat  the position is with regard to the future  supply\r\n\r\nof electricity in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of housing, which rightly affects the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore, here again, Mr Speaker, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of water and electricity supply is important.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  know  that during the last  year  or  so  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  not  done very  much  in  the  way  of\r\n\r\nphysical  construction of houses, but during  the  last\r\n\r\nsix  months they have accelerated construction and  are\r\n\r\ngetting  on  with  the job. But I  do  not  think,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.  Sir,  that the Government can  maintain  this\r\n\r\nrate  of  development  if  they  do  not  develop  the\r\n\r\ncapacity  of  water  supply and  electrical  energy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  There is no point, to my mind, in  building\r\n\r\nhouses  in Singapore if we cannot give to those  houses\r\n\r\nan   adequate  supply  of  water  and  electric  light.\r\n\r\nElectricity may be unimportant: we might be able to use\r\n\r\ncandles or kerosene. But in a modern city such as ours,\r\n\r\nwhere  the sewage is dependent for its carriage  on  an\r\n\r\nadequate supply of water, you will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrealise, Mr Speaker, Sir, how important it is that  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  safe and adequate water supply. If we have  no\r\n\r\nwater  supply, then houses will be left unoccupied, if\r\n\r\nthe Housing Board say, \"We have constructed 3,000 units\r\n\r\nfor  this year,\" it is a meaningless statement  because\r\n\r\nthose 3,000 units will remain unoccupied merely because\r\n\r\nthe  Government has fallen down on its job of providing\r\n\r\nan adequate water supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on the question of housing, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe know that the Housing Board depend for their sources\r\n\r\nof  money  on  the Government. I have read through  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement of the Minister for Finance. We  know\r\n\r\nthat the money is on loan, but in no place does he  say\r\n\r\nthe  terms  and  conditions under which the  loans  are\r\n\r\nmade.  I  think this House will be interested  to  hear\r\n\r\nfrom  the Minister for Finance the percentage  rate  of\r\n\r\ninterest,  the manner of repayment, and how  the  loans\r\n\r\nare effected. He has also said that he is considering a\r\n\r\nhousing  subsidy, and has told the House that  when  he\r\n\r\nhas  definitely made up his mind on this, he  will  let\r\n\r\nthe House know all about it. If he is now in a position\r\n\r\nto  tell us the quantum of the subsidy and how and  why\r\n\r\nit is going to be used - whether it is going to be used\r\n\r\nto  reduce rentals all round, or whether there is going\r\n\r\nto  be a scheme by way of a means test - I think  this\r\n\r\nHouse will be very much obliged to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point on which I wish to touch is the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  a  tax  on properties in  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance has done very well  out  of  the\r\n\r\nproperty  tax.  I notice he has had a windfall  of  $12\r\n\r\nmillion  more on property tax than he expected.  Now  I\r\n\r\nask him to reconsider the position which I advocated to\r\n\r\nthis  House some months ago when the property  tax  was\r\n\r\nbeing  discussed - the question of remitting  assessments\r\n\r\non  vacant houses. The Minister then indicated that  it\r\n\r\nwas  not a practical problem, because there was such  a\r\n\r\nhousing shortage in Singapore that it was impossible to\r\n\r\nhave  a shortage of houses! I would urge upon him again\r\n\r\nto  reconsider the position because it is not a  matter\r\n\r\nof houses which are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt  and available to be let being vacant. On that  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  him entirely. Unless he makes it  possible\r\n\r\nfor  property owners to claim a remission on unoccupied\r\n\r\nproperties, property developers are going  to  be  very\r\n\r\nhesitant about developing a housing estate. This is the\r\n\r\npoint,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. As soon as a certificate  of\r\n\r\nfitness is obtained by the developer, the property  tax\r\n\r\nautomatically  attaches to the property.  Unfortunately\r\n\r\nit attaches to the property by operation of law. Now if\r\n\r\na    property   owner   develops   a   hundred   houses\r\n\r\nsimultaneously - and I believe they have to develop  them\r\n\r\nsimultaneously if they want to keep the  cost  down - and\r\n\r\nif  they  do  not sell them simultaneously before  this\r\n\r\noperation  of law attaches a tax to them, and  if  they\r\n\r\nsell  Only  50 per cent of the houses, then assessments\r\n\r\non the rest of the 50 per cent of the houses is raised.\r\n\r\nInstead  of  housing  development  becoming  a   paying\r\n\r\nproposition,  one  can imagine a set  of  circumstances\r\n\r\nwhere  it could be a loss to the developer. With  these\r\n\r\nthoughts  in  mind,  he  is shy of  developing  houses.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  position  is  that,  because  of  this\r\n\r\ndifficulty, housing developers are being precluded from\r\n\r\ndeveloping housing estates in the manner they would  do\r\n\r\nif  they  know that ii is possible in law to go  for  a\r\n\r\nwaiver of tax on vacant houses. I think that will be  a\r\n\r\ngreater  impetus to housing developers.  Sir,  this  is\r\n\r\nsuch  a  small matter from the point of view of raising\r\n\r\ntax,  and  such a big point in the way of an inducement\r\n\r\nto  housing  developers, that I think the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance will do well to reconsider his policy on vacant\r\n\r\nhouses.  If  he reconsiders the position and favourably\r\n\r\nconsiders vacant houses, then it might be necessary  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  amending  legislation to  the  Property  Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another point I wish to touch upon. I\r\n\r\nsee that in the Minister's Budget Statement he has said\r\n\r\nthat  he is going to give a gift of houses which belong\r\n\r\nto  the Municipal Rate Fund to the Trading Departments.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  see why he should be so generous  with  the\r\n\r\nratepayer's money. I think he should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  make  a  gift to the Trading Departments.  If  the\r\n\r\nTrading  Departments  were  to  make  a  gift  to   the\r\n\r\nMunicipal Rate Fund, I would gladly accept that because\r\n\r\nthen  it would inure for the benefit of the Fund  which\r\n\r\nis  the  taxpayer's money. The Trading Departments  are\r\n\r\npurely  trading concerns of the City Council. They  are\r\n\r\npurely commercial projects. I cannot understand why the\r\n\r\nMunicipal  Rate Fund should subsidise trading projects.\r\n\r\nI  would  suggest  that is wrong in principle.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinister thinks of handing them over, I would  ask  him\r\n\r\nto  ask the new Board to hand over an equivalent sum of\r\n\r\nmoney  to him when he makes the handover to this Board.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I might refer him to this passage in page 15 of\r\n\r\nthe Annual Budget Statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Certain houses and buildings which are the property\r\n\r\nof the Rate Fund Departments will be handed over to the\r\n\r\nnew Board in order that it may be properly equipped  to\r\n\r\ncarry on its functions economically in the interests of\r\n\r\nconsumers of water, gas and electricity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>By the phrase \"handed over\", Mr Speaker, Sir - I hope  I\r\n\r\nam  not  doing  the Minister an injustice - when  a  chap\r\n\r\nhands over something to me, I hope he hands it over  to\r\n\r\nme   as   a  gift;  but  if  the  handover  is  for   a\r\n\r\nconsideration,  for  an adequate proper  market  value,\r\n\r\nthen I have no objection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I wish to have elucidation from the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance on another point. He has made a  statement\r\n\r\nthat  quite  recently a loan of $50  million  has  been\r\n\r\nfloated  which has been fully subscribed. I  think  the\r\n\r\nHouse  would  like  to- know who the persons  were  who\r\n\r\nsubscribed  to it, whether they were local  or  foreign\r\n\r\nsubscribers, or whether it was mostly taken up  by  the\r\n\r\nbanks  or  by  private individuals, and the  extent  to\r\n\r\nwhich  private individuals, banks, trustees and  people\r\n\r\nin that category contributed to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point on which I would like to touch, quite\r\n\r\ncursorily  now but I would like to enlarge on  it  when\r\n\r\ncoming  to debate the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech,\r\n\r\nis  the  question of income tax. I am  not  asking  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to reduce income tax, but he has  taken  unto\r\n\r\nhimself  and his Department certain powers  of  raising\r\n\r\nassessments whereupon the tax\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimmediately becomes payable: and if any argument ensues\r\n\r\non the correctness of the assessment and the Income Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment  subsequently  concedes  that  is  has  been\r\n\r\nwrong,  then  there  must be a remission  of  the  tax.\r\n\r\nHaving  arrived  at  the stage  where  a  remission  is\r\n\r\naccepted by the Comptroller, its payment takes a  long,\r\n\r\nlong time - almost an indecently long time, I am told by\r\n\r\nthe  people who are waiting for it. This is one of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  which  I expected would  happen  in  this\r\n\r\ncase.  It  is  purely  an  administrative  matter,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. If the Comptroller has said, \"Yes, I have\r\n\r\nassessed you too much. I must remit you X dollars,\" and\r\n\r\nthe money has been received by the Government, I see no\r\n\r\ndifficulty in repayment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Human nature!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> It is not human nature, Sir. The\r\n\r\nGovernment is inhuman.

I would like to inform hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  what  is in my mind. The encroachment  by  the\r\n\r\nFifth  Supplementary Estimates was a  matter  of  seven\r\n\r\nminutes.  Perhaps  if I do not use for  the  tea  break\r\n\r\nuntil about seven minutes past five, that will meet the\r\n\r\ncase   of  the  time  being  taken  up  by  the   Fifth\r\n\r\nSupplementary Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I was saying that the difficulty was\r\n\r\nnot  about  the  humanity  of the  Government  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter. Where an institution becomes so large that  the\r\n\r\nleft  hand does not know what the right hand is  doing;\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Finance  wants  a  thing   to   be\r\n\r\nimplemented straightaway, but he has a Comptroller  who\r\n\r\nhas  so many vassals under him, and in the pressure  of\r\n\r\nwork  and in the computation of incomes which they want\r\n\r\nto  gather - and I am told by the Minister he has caught\r\n\r\nup  on the backlog - and while they are catching up on\r\n\r\ntheir  backlog,  Mr Speaker, Sir, they have  forgotten\r\n\r\nthe people who are waiting to receive their money which\r\n\r\nGovernment should not have had in the first place. That\r\n\r\nis  the  position.  Sir,  one  of  the  reasons  why  I\r\n\r\nsuggested that an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterest   should  be  paid  by  the   Government   for\r\n\r\nwithholding   the   money  for  the   period   of   the\r\n\r\nwithholdment  was this. If an interest was  charged  on\r\n\r\nthat money, the Comptroller would see to it that it was\r\n\r\nquickly  returned - at  least the  Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nwould see to it that it was quickly returned. The point\r\n\r\nnow  is  that  his  Comptroller is so  concerned  about\r\n\r\ngathering  in the tax that he forgets to  pay  out  the\r\n\r\nmoney  that he has over-gathered, and the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  does  not  know anything about  it.  The  only\r\n\r\nchance  of getting this to the ears of the Minister  is\r\n\r\nan occasion such as this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He is very efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I do hope that the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nwill  issue adequate and explicit instructions  to  his\r\n\r\nComptroller to see that these remissions should be made\r\n\r\nexpeditiously,  otherwise it brings into  contempt  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of the taxing system, and we do not want  to  do\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point on which I wish to congratulate\r\n\r\nthe  Government is this. For a long time, City  Council\r\n\r\nemployees were in doubt as to what was going to  happen\r\n\r\nto  their future and their terms of employment.  I  now\r\n\r\nunderstand  from  the financial statement  that  it  is\r\n\r\nproposed  not  to alter their terms and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice one iota. They were most worried about what was\r\n\r\ngoing to happen to their Municipal Provident Fund.  And\r\n\r\nI am very glad to see, Sir, that Government has made up\r\n\r\nits  mind to carry on with the Municipal Provident Fund\r\n\r\nand  to  let the employees who are now contributing  to\r\n\r\nthat  fund to remain on that fund and to retire on that\r\n\r\nfund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point that I want to touch upon is the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  the Work Brigade. This Work Brigade,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, is an emotional matter, if I may  put  it\r\n\r\nthat  way.  From  the point of view of the  Government,\r\n\r\nwhen  they started it, it was an emotional institution,\r\n\r\nnot a practical institution. For reasons best known  to\r\n\r\nthe  Government  it  started  this  Work  Brigade.   On\r\n\r\nprinciple, Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it was wrong to do\r\n\r\nthat - to have this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmall  Work Brigade do these little jobs all  over  the\r\n\r\nplace.  In a commercial and trading city such as  ours,\r\n\r\nit  is  wrong.  There are lots of people  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhose livelihood depends on these little odd jobs which\r\n\r\nthe  Government, the City Council, the  Housing  Board,\r\n\r\nand such like institutions provide. The institution  of\r\n\r\nthis   Work  Brigade  meant  that  those  people  whose\r\n\r\nlivelihood depended on that type of work were  deprived\r\n\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That, I think, Mr Speaker, was absolutely\r\n\r\nwrong. I do recommend most heartily the dissolution  of\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade. If the Government had  a  political\r\n\r\npurpose, it seems to have overdone it. Members  of  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade are on strike now! Anyway, leaving  aside\r\n\r\nthe  political implications, the rightness or wrongness\r\n\r\nof  the strike, and whether people like them should  be\r\n\r\nallowed to form a trade union, if they go on strike and\r\n\r\nsit  down there, public projects are held up: and these\r\n\r\ncould  easily  have  been done by people  who  live  in\r\n\r\ncubicles  in  Chinatown, whose livelihood  depended  on\r\n\r\nthese  things, and are now being deprived of them.  So,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, if we talk about first-class citizens\r\n\r\nand second-class citizens, we get to the stage where  a\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade member is a first-class citizen, and  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  live in Chinatown and who are deprived  of\r\n\r\ntheir  normal  livelihood by these people  are  second-class  citizens. And we do not want first- and  second-class  citizens  in  this city  anyway.

It is a pity the Minister is not here as I  want\r\n\r\nto  ask him whether he is going to start a private army\r\n\r\nof his own! Really, Mr Speaker, Sir, I really do think\r\n\r\nthe  Work Brigade is played out. Let us get back to the\r\n\r\nold system. This old system. Mr Speaker, Sir, has been\r\n\r\nestablished over a period of time, has been  tested  by\r\n\r\ntime,  and  has not been found wanting.

There is no virtue in changing:  it  does  not\r\n\r\nbring  anything  good  commensurate  with  the  change.\r\n\r\nTherefore, let us abolish the Work Brigade.

He tells us that we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  indulging  in  slogans which do  not  feed  empty\r\n\r\nstomachs.  I  would ask the Minister for  Finance  just\r\n\r\nwhat  does his Budget Statement do about feeding  empty\r\n\r\nstomachs?  It  shamelessly shirks the issue  of  making\r\n\r\nprovisions  for  the  unemployed,  either  by  way   of\r\n\r\ncreating  employment  or  by way  of  providing  social\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, whilst blaming us for wool gathering in\r\n\r\norbit,  he  himself indulges in pipe-dreams  of  a  new\r\n\r\nindependence. It seems we have had an old independence,\r\n\r\nand we are going to have a new independence. As he puts\r\n\r\nit,  a  merger,  according to him, will certainly  take\r\n\r\nplace at the latest in 1963. I want to say this to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment - and I trust they will believe me that I  say\r\n\r\nit with a sense of the gravity of what I am saying - that\r\n\r\nif  the Government continue to handle the issue of  our\r\n\r\nrelationship  with the Federation in the same  arrogant\r\n\r\nand   ham-handed   manner  that  they  have   displayed\r\n\r\nrecently, then the referendum which they have  promised\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  slap in the face which will  really  shock\r\n\r\nthem, negative the proposals for closer relations which\r\n\r\nthey say they seek and which their conduct makes it  so\r\n\r\ndifficult to accept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most alarming feature of this Budget without\r\n\r\nvirtue  is the fact that it is completely devoid  of  a\r\n\r\ndynamic  approach to what is recognised  as  a  dynamic\r\n\r\nsituation.  We are almost led to believe  that,  lulled\r\n\r\ninto  a  sense  of  security by  the  so-called  closer\r\n\r\nrelations with the Federation, the Government  seek  to\r\n\r\nsurrender Singapore to the greater priority of Petaling\r\n\r\nJaya. Is there then to be an end of a vigorous approach\r\n\r\nto our unemployment problem, and even to the promise of\r\n\r\nsocialist measures to give our poor the security and  a\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living compatible with human decency?  is\r\n\r\nthe socialist concept of security for the individual to\r\n\r\ngive way to the prevailing Federation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomic  policy? is it to mean unconditional surrender\r\n\r\nof  those very ideals for which this Front Bench  stood\r\n\r\nand  in  respect of which it was elected - the practical\r\n\r\nideal  of socialism for the improvement of the  lot  of\r\n\r\nthe  common  man? For there is nothing in  this  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement that gives even token sympathy for the lot of\r\n\r\nthe poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government has in its lifetime made two\r\n\r\nsubstantial  contributions  to  our  welfare,   and   I\r\n\r\nrecognise them. One was the vigorous approach displayed\r\n\r\nin  the  past  20 months by the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard.  That  was a magnificent effort  for  which  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development and his  Government\r\n\r\nare  entitled to take full credit. I would like to  say\r\n\r\nthat  as  a  citizen  and  as a representative  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  I want to express my gratitude for the  energy\r\n\r\nand  skill displayed by his Ministry in that particular\r\n\r\nfield.  I want to say to the Minister for Finance  that\r\n\r\nit  will be with pleasure that I will support all loans\r\n\r\nand  assistance necessary to the Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment in the field of housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt the Minister recognises that he owes\r\n\r\nmuch  to  his predecessor, and perhaps even to previous\r\n\r\ngovernments, for the ground work laid for this dramatic\r\n\r\nexpansion in housing. But he himself is fully  entitled\r\n\r\nto  a  hundred per cent credit for bringing those  past\r\n\r\nhopes, plans and efforts to fruition to the extent that\r\n\r\nhe  has  surpassed all the previous efforts of previous\r\n\r\ngovernments,  who themselves were seeking,  I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt honestly, to make their contribution to those  in\r\n\r\nneed of housing in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government, in 1959 and 1960, started with\r\n\r\nthe  sorriest possible record in the field of  housing.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only fair to give credit to those who  are  now\r\n\r\nchanging  the picture. It is my hope that the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  not  rest on his oars and that we will, in  fact,\r\n\r\nhave annually the 10,000 houses necessary not only  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  need housing today but for the increase  of\r\n\r\nour  population annually. I am happy to note, Sir, that\r\n\r\nin that field at least there seems to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nno let-up and that the Ministry is being given such tools,\r\n\r\nboth financially and otherwise, as he requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one other field of this Government's\r\n\r\nadministration which has attracted, and still attracts, my\r\n\r\nadmiration,  and  that is in its realistic  and  energetic\r\n\r\napproach   in   making  available  industrial   sites   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. It is not a new idea, but they have taken  hold\r\n\r\nof  it  well and they have brought about its fruition,  or\r\n\r\nrather they have tried to bring it about in a manner  that\r\n\r\nany  of us who travels to Singapore can see, and I for one\r\n\r\nhope to see a great deal more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, both in the statement by the Minister and,\r\n\r\nin so far as I can assess, from the Budget, there seems to\r\n\r\nbe  a flagging of interest which I find a little alarming.\r\n\r\nThe  excuse - it may be a valid excuse - the Minister  is\r\n\r\ngiving  is that there are inadequate professional  men  to\r\n\r\ncope with requirements. This, Sir, is also the excuse that\r\n\r\nhe  has  given in respect of the promised reclaimation  of\r\n\r\nswamps  known as the Kallang Project, where  we  are  told\r\n\r\nquite  bluntly  that  the detailed  design  is  not  being\r\n\r\nproceeded  with.  Again and again throughout  that  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  the Minister has put forward this excuse - and\r\n\r\nwhen  I  use the word \"excuse\" I do not necessarily  mean,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  it  is not valid - that adequate technical  and\r\n\r\nprofessional  personnel  are unavailable.  I  say  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  the solution of the problem  is,  and  has\r\n\r\nalways  been, in the hands of the Government. It  is  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  which has chased away technical personnel  and\r\n\r\nwhich  has  made  it  very difficult  for  us  to  recruit\r\n\r\nprofessional  and  technical men.  It  is  their  arrogant\r\n\r\nconduct, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Prove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The facts are there in the City Council, in\r\n\r\nthe  legal  services and throughout the  public  services.\r\n\r\nSince   this  Government  took  office,  the   number   of\r\n\r\nresignations  of  professional and technical  men  in  the\r\n\r\nmedical  service - we have had some figures  already - and  I\r\n\r\nsay  it  is due to the arrogant conduct of this Government\r\n\r\nand its complete ruthlessness in its human relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, surely this Assembly has not forgotten the notorious\r\n\r\nEnright  letter.  The  only  adjectives  that  are  really\r\n\r\napplicable to that letter are unparliamentary, and I leave\r\n\r\nit to the imagination of the decent Members of this House.\r\n\r\nBut  this House may well not be aware that that letter  of\r\n\r\ngutter  culture had a tremendous damaging  effect  on  the\r\n\r\nimage  of  Singapore  overseas amongst  professional  men.\r\n\r\nTheir  attitude now is why should they, who are  respected\r\n\r\nand  responsible men of academic standing and  stature  in\r\n\r\ntheir respective fields, come to Singapore where they have\r\n\r\nto subject themselves to the humiliations, the insults and\r\n\r\nthe  barbaric conduct of the notorious P.A.P.  Government?\r\n\r\nThe  Minister has told you he has made various  approaches\r\n\r\nto  various  governments. That is true, Sir, I  have  some\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  it.  But  I  say  to  you,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  fails  because it fails to  recognise  certain\r\n\r\nbasic  principles. The first basic principle, to my  mind,\r\n\r\nis  to  recognise that our Malayanisation policy  requires\r\n\r\nthat  as  soon  as  possible, in fact, even  where  it  is\r\n\r\nimpossible,  a  Malayan should be at  the  head  of  every\r\n\r\ndepartment.  Malayans  should be  in  key  positions.  But\r\n\r\notherwise professional and technical personnel may,  where\r\n\r\nnecessary,  be  expatriates. The other principle  is  that\r\n\r\nprofessional  and  technical men are in tremendous  demand\r\n\r\nthroughout  the world. The world today is experiencing  an\r\n\r\nexpanding need, because in vast areas of the world  - not\r\n\r\nonly  Singapore,  Sir,  not  only  Asia,  but  Africa  and\r\n\r\nelsewhere - there is a tremendous expansion on the  part  of\r\n\r\npeople for services which would bring them greater comfort\r\n\r\nand  even  what are now recognised as basic  needs.  Those\r\n\r\nservices  are performed mainly by professional men.  Those\r\n\r\nprofessional   men,   whether  they   are   engineers   or\r\n\r\narchitects, lawyers or doctors, are in very great  demand.\r\n\r\nIn order to attract them to Singapore, their conditions of\r\n\r\nservice  must  be encouraging and attractive.  Economy  in\r\n\r\nthis field is false economy resulting in a tremendous loss\r\n\r\nto  our people. I urge our Minister for Finance, who is so\r\n\r\npedestrian  that  the word \"imagination\"  repels  him,  to\r\n\r\nexercise a little human understanding and, if he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot,  to seek advice from those who have achieved  some\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  human relations in drawing  up  a  scheme  to\r\n\r\nattract professional and technical personnel from overseas\r\n\r\nto fulfil our needs. If we approach the problem as a human\r\n\r\nproblem, Sir, you will recognise that, first and foremost,\r\n\r\nwe must destroy the image that in Singapore a professional\r\n\r\nman   will   have   to  suffer  P.A.P. insults,   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhumiliations  and  improper  P.A.P. interference  in  the\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  his  duties. We must  also  assure  him  of\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  tenure.  We  must  give  him  conditions  of\r\n\r\nremuneration that would have some relationship  with  what\r\n\r\nhe  can  get  in  private practice.  Today  the  image  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, to professional and technical men overseas,  is\r\n\r\nan  image  worthy only of their contempt. I  say  to  this\r\n\r\nGovernment, which though I believe is dying yet  threatens\r\n\r\nto  live one more year, that even in that one year it  can\r\n\r\ndo  a  great  deal of damage. I do ask that  it  seriously\r\n\r\nreconsider  and  reorient  its  policy  not  only  towards\r\n\r\nexpatriate  professional  man, but  also  towards  Malayan\r\n\r\nprofessional and technical men. Sir, these men can earn in\r\n\r\nprivate  practice incomes considerably in excess  of  what\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  accept in Government service.  You  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect to attract good men although you can expect to keep\r\n\r\nthose  who are with you because they do not wish  to  lose\r\n\r\nthe  hopes  of pensions which are the main attraction  for\r\n\r\ncontinuity of service. But I do say, Sir, that  unless  we\r\n\r\napproach  the  problem realistically  of  recruiting  both\r\n\r\nMalayan  and expatriate personnel in the professional  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  fields, we will keep having a  bumbling  budget\r\n\r\nlike  this one, where all we can do is vote vast sums that\r\n\r\nare never spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the arrogance and false sense of economy of this\r\n\r\nFront  Bench  has been a clot on the development  of  this\r\n\r\narea -  a  clot  that  it  is time it  was  dissolved.  The\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Finance   has  mentioned   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. I think we are all  happy.  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nfinally  it has been set up. The delay has been inordinate\r\n\r\nand  the proud boast that solid progress has already  been\r\n\r\nregistered in farcical. The only progress, in so far as  I\r\n\r\ncan  assess from the Minister's statement, is that a half-million dollar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nloan  to  a local ship-building firm has been granted  and\r\n\r\nsome 12 industries for pioneer status have been processed.\r\n\r\nLet  us  not  have  empty boasts.  The  personnel  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic   Development  Board,  Sir,  do  give   rise   to\r\n\r\nlegitimate hopes of solid progress. Let us not spoil it by\r\n\r\ncheap  boasts.  I look forward in the next few  months  to\r\n\r\nsolid  progress.  But the solid progress  which  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved is a statement that comes from outer space  where\r\n\r\nthe Minister seeks to send the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Industrial Research Unit has been promised for\r\n\r\nmore  years then I can remember. Finally we are told  that\r\n\r\nit  is almost in sight. Let us not drag our feet either in\r\n\r\nits formation or its functioning. The P.A.P. now knows  it\r\n\r\nhas  not  got eternity to work in to meet the requirements\r\n\r\nof  our  pressing  employment problem. We  are  told  with\r\n\r\npleasure  - and  it  is a pleasure that I  share - that  the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank has agreed to finance our development projects.\r\n\r\nIt  is  certainly an achievement. I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister whether this promise of loans will in any way  be\r\n\r\naffected by the fact that in our proposed closer relations\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation, we would be only in control of  some\r\n\r\nthree-quarters of our annual income. Would Singapore still\r\n\r\nbe in a position to negotiate loans with the World Bank on\r\n\r\nfavourable terms?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I gather, Mr Speaker, Sir, he tells me\r\n\r\nthat that is so.

It is a pity his imagination does not  go  with\r\n\r\nthe  facts. Sir, the Minister for Finance has  mentioned\r\n\r\nthe Schereschewsky Report on steel mills and he has also\r\n\r\nmentioned  the Winsemius Report on industrialisation.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know why these reports  have  not  been\r\n\r\ntabled. Is there a danger to our security that we should\r\n\r\nknow  what  is in those reports? Have they  anywhere  by\r\n\r\nimplication suggested it? Perhaps the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nhas  not  got  white wings and a halo? I would  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  tell us when we may expect to  have  these\r\n\r\nreports, as we are entitled to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has congratulated himself on the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a trade representative in Indonesia.  I\r\n\r\ncertainly agree with him that that was a good move.  Our\r\n\r\ntrade relationship with Indonesia has been deteriorating\r\n\r\nfar  too  long  for  entirely  artificial  reasons, and\r\n\r\nrestoration to a healthier approach would be to both our\r\n\r\nadvantage  and Indonesia's. But in view of the  repeated\r\n\r\nquestions we have put to him, I would have liked to  see\r\n\r\nan  effort on his part - at least a token effort - to send\r\n\r\na  trade  mission, not necessarily residing, but  for  a\r\n\r\ntrip to Delhi and Peking, to see what could be achieved.\r\n\r\nI  do  say, Sir, the money involved would not be  great.\r\n\r\nThe advantage may well be great. It is worth the effort.\r\n\r\nIn  a country like ours which depends on trade, a little\r\n\r\nimaginative  approach to our problems may well  pay  far\r\n\r\ngreater dividends than the costs of debentures which are\r\n\r\na  failure.  I  do express the hope that  even  now  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  tell us he will consider  sending  trade\r\n\r\nmissions  to  those  capitals  with  whom  there  is   a\r\n\r\npotential of greater trade with Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has drawn your attention to\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade. Sir, I was not here  when  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  was  formed. I confess I have not  studied  the\r\n\r\nissue  whether the Work Brigade is a good thing or  not.\r\n\r\nBut  there is one aspect of our allotment for  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade   which  exercises  my  mind.  It  should   have\r\n\r\ndefinitely come from a trade unionist, but since it has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot,  Sir,  I  would like to draw the attention  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  to it. It is my view that the people in the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  are  being  grossly underpaid  and  that  their\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service are inappropriate.  I  say  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  must accept the principle that a  member  of\r\n\r\nthe Work Brigade is entitled to the same remuneration as\r\n\r\nthey  would  have  to pay to a worker  who  is  a  trade\r\n\r\nunionist  and  can  demand  a  proper  remuneration.   I\r\n\r\nrecognise that in the Work Brigade they are being housed\r\n\r\nand fed, and I accept the principle that from the proper\r\n\r\nremuneration that they should receive there should be  a\r\n\r\ndeduction  for  both housing and feeding.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  I  would  like an assurance that,  in  fact,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment accepts the principle that payments for their\r\n\r\nservices  should  not  be less  than  payments  for  the\r\n\r\nservices of outside workers and that it is not a  device\r\n\r\nfor cheap and sweated labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year we will have a television service. It was\r\n\r\npromised  to  us six years ago. Other things  intervened\r\n\r\nand  we  are now told - not by this Government; I do  not\r\n\r\nblame them - that we will be having it next year. Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthe  light of experience of what has happened  to  Radio\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  I  ask  for  an assurance that  the  television\r\n\r\nservice  will  not  be used as an adjunct  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolitical  machine but will be used for  the  legitimate\r\n\r\nrequirements of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has proved himself quite an empire builder in the name of the P.A.P. He has no understanding of culture and little understanding of the needs of the people. In so far as I can judge, his activities have been materially directed to the political welfare of his colleagues and his party. I for one, in so far as I can, will resist the expansion of the empire that he seeks by the additional expenditure\r\n\r\nin the Budget. The so-called expansion of the activities\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister for Culture must be justified  on  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of the people, and there must be protection  from\r\n\r\nwhat  we know to have been past political abuse  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  machinery of propaganda for party  political\r\n\r\npurposes. I do not think it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproper,  and, in so far as I can, I will not permit  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  public  money  for the benefit  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npolitical machine and the whitewashing of the Government\r\n\r\nFront Bench.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next we have the petroleum duty. Have you noticed that\r\n\r\nthe  petroleum duty has fallen by $2 million? Sir, in  a\r\n\r\nBudget that clearly indicates a buoyant economy, that is\r\n\r\nsurprising;  and  whilst on the  subject  of  a  buoyant\r\n\r\neconomy, let me answer the question of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance who asked, \"If we are a bad Government that  has\r\n\r\nnot  done well with the people of Singapore, how  is  it\r\n\r\nthat  our economy is expanding?\" [interruption]  Oh,  it\r\n\r\nwas an indiscretion. I am so glad he recognises that  it\r\n\r\nis   non  sequitur,  that,  in  fact,  the  economy   is\r\n\r\nexpanding - no thanks to this Government - but by virtue  of\r\n\r\nthe activities of our people and of the area in which we\r\n\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of elucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I was engaged in some remarks vis-a-vis what the Member for Hong Lim said.

This is\r\n\r\nwhat he had to say about the business registration tax:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The reason for introducing this form of taxation is\r\n\r\napparent. A large majority of small shopkeepers do  not\r\n\r\ncontribute  whatsoever to the Inland Revenue.  Further,\r\n\r\nif  the  proprietor is a man of abstemious  habits,  he\r\n\r\ndoes not even contribute to the liquor and tobacco tax.\r\n\r\nIf  he lives in a shop premise, as is usually the case,\r\n\r\nhe  does  not  own  a  motor car  and  hence  does  not\r\n\r\ncontribute to the petroleum duty. Such persons are in a\r\n\r\ntruly   privileged  position.  Their  children  receive\r\n\r\neducation, the cost of which the State pays  up  to  98\r\n\r\nper  cent  or  more. If any member of his family  falls\r\n\r\nill,  he  can get free treatment or near free treatment\r\n\r\nin State hospitals or dispensaries.

Hawkers' licensing fees\r\n\r\nare  on  the average much higher than the rates we  are\r\n\r\nlevying  on sole proprietorships and partnerships.  The\r\n\r\nyield  from this business registration fee is  expected\r\n\r\nto be about $2.0 million per year.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That was last year, Sir. Now we are told that we do not\r\n\r\nneed  this $2 million because of our reunification with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation - that is his word - and because the Budget\r\n\r\nshows  a surplus.

I have made repeated efforts in this  Chamber\r\n\r\nto  obtain at least a promise from this Government that\r\n\r\nthey  would introduce social legislation.

Cancel  the\r\n\r\nbusiness   registration  tax - 90,000  people  officially\r\n\r\nstarving,  and  not  a word about them.  40,000  people\r\n\r\nunemployed  and  a lot more under-employed - not  a  word\r\n\r\nabout  them. What has he done? I do not know, Sir,  how\r\n\r\nit  is possible for this Government to have not even  a\r\n\r\ntwinge of conscience in refusing to make provision  for\r\n\r\nunemployment insurance or for social security  measures\r\n\r\nin  the field of sickness allowance, widows' allowance,\r\n\r\nold  age  pensions.  The  country  is  ripe  for  these\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Sir,  these  promises  were  good  for   the\r\n\r\nelection  when  these gentlemen whom  you  see  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Benches used to spit, and spit, and spit  at\r\n\r\nthe Government of the Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It seems that the current\r\n\r\nyear's economic policy appears to be very simple to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. It gives the people the impression that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment intends to shirk its responsibility in  order\r\n\r\nto  cover  up its previous errors. I believe all  of  us\r\n\r\nhave  heard the Minister for Finance say that  the  1962\r\n\r\nBudget would be the last of its kind in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has said that this year is\r\n\r\na year of construction. Looking at the Budget, the word\r\n\r\n\"construction\" is very attractive. In fact,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccording to the Member for Queenstown (the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis) the Budget for 1962 shows that  it\r\n\r\nis  only 40 per cent of the performance of the Budget of\r\n\r\n1961.  We  have looked at the Budget. To us, 1962  is  a\r\n\r\ndying year for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you compare the 1962 economic\r\n\r\npolicy with the 1961 economic policy, you will note that\r\n\r\nthis  is still an old tune. The Financial Statement made\r\n\r\nby  the Minister for Finance on the economic policy  has\r\n\r\nnot  mentioned  the state of unemployment in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThat  is,  it has not stated whether the Government  has\r\n\r\ntried to solve the problem of unemployment. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance has not stated whether, during its two years\r\n\r\nof  office, the Government has created opportunities for\r\n\r\nemployment and to what extent. During its two  years  of\r\n\r\noffice,  the  livelihood  of the  people  has  not  been\r\n\r\nimproved.  The  Minister for Finance has not  stated  to\r\n\r\nwhat  extent it has been improved. All this has not been\r\n\r\nmentioned in his Financial Statement. I feel much regret\r\n\r\nat this omission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has often said that its\r\n\r\ndeeds  conform  to its words. But if  you  look  at  the\r\n\r\npromises  which it made in its pamphlet in  1959 - in  The\r\n\r\nTasks  Ahead - Part  I  under the  article  \"Our  Economic\r\n\r\nPolicy\" - you will find that it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The objective of the economic policy of a People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  government will  be  to  obtain  for  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  masses of the people, a happy, full and  secure\r\n\r\nlivelihood.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>How confident and how considerate it was! Yet the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  been  in office for 2\u00bd years. Is there any solution\r\n\r\nto the problem of unemployment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point in this article which has attracted\r\n\r\nthe attention of this House. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The unemployment problem is very serious. If we do not\r\n\r\ntake  any step to consolidate and strengthen our economy\r\n\r\nto  create employment opportunities up to 1962, then  it\r\n\r\nwill be very serious.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>These  were  the actual words spoken by the  P.A.P. in\r\n\r\n1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore there will be about 20,000 to 30,000\r\n\r\npeople every year looking for work. We feel like asking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. this. How many people today  are  still  left\r\n\r\nunemployed?  How  many  employment  opportunities  has  it\r\n\r\ncreated so far? \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance says that he has\r\n\r\ntried   to   promote  economic  expansion, to   encourage\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  and  to give  pioneer  status  to  new\r\n\r\nindustries. He says that up to the end of this year,  five\r\n\r\npioneer  industries will probably be established  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry  and  will go into production. However,  how  many\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities can be created in such a  manner?\r\n\r\nIt  is  not clearly stated in the Financial Statement.  He\r\n\r\nsays  further there have been 27 applications for  pioneer\r\n\r\nindustry status and there will be employment for 1,900. If\r\n\r\nwe  calculate on this basis - taking for granted that these\r\n\r\nfactories  will  be  put  into production - how  will  these\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities compare with the 20,000 to 30,000\r\n\r\npeople  looking  for work every year in Singapore?  If  we\r\n\r\ntake  for granted that these 1,900 people can get jobs  by\r\n\r\nthe  end  of this year, it only constitutes 6 per cent  of\r\n\r\nthe total unemployed people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If industrialisation is carried out in this manner, how\r\n\r\ncan   we  solve  our  unemployment  problem?  The  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister did not set out the steps for its solution in his\r\n\r\nstatement. The only thing he is proud of is the  Four-Year\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Plan. The main objective of this  Development\r\n\r\nPlan  is to increase the total national income per  capita\r\n\r\nfrom  11  per cent to 20 per cent. Let us see whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has raised the standard of living of the people\r\n\r\nor whether it has raised the per capita income. If we look\r\n\r\nat  the Government estimates, to tell the truth, it  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  attractive and impressive document. The figures  are\r\n\r\nvery  big. If you study the projects in detail,  you  will\r\n\r\nnote just how much the Government has done this year.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown has exposed this just now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will try to set out the three main features of this\r\n\r\nBudget.  In  the  1962  Development  Estimates,  we   have\r\n\r\napproved $3,690,000. However, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namount that has been spent in 1961 is about $673,000. This\r\n\r\nis  only 20 per cent of the amount allotted. This  is  the\r\n\r\nsituation in the Ministry of Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take a look at the Ministry of Education, in spite\r\n\r\nof  the  fact that the Ministry of Education has  built  a\r\n\r\nnumber of schools - it has made a promise to build a certain\r\n\r\nnumber  of  schools, and in the 1961 Development Estimates\r\n\r\n$22   million  has  been  allotted  to  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation - not  enough schools have  been  built.  But  the\r\n\r\nactual  sum  which is expected to be spent  this  year  is\r\n\r\nabout $6,900,000. This means that development in the field\r\n\r\nof education shows only 30 per cent performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take a look at Social Welfare, the original\r\n\r\nestimate  for  1961  is $360,000, but  the  actual  amount\r\n\r\nexpected  to  be  spent at the end of this  year  is  very\r\n\r\ndisappointing. The Department of Social Welfare has  spent\r\n\r\nabout $6,000. The Assembly has allotted $360,000, but only\r\n\r\n$6,000  has  been spent. This is only 2 per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\namount allotted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a simple example and an actual fact. The Government has tried to make the Budget figures very impressive and attractive. As a matter of\r\n\r\nfact, the Government is not firm in its implementation  of\r\n\r\npolicies.  The Government says it has money and wishes  to\r\n\r\nimplement  its  policies, but is short of technicians  and\r\n\r\nprofessional  men.  If  you look  up  the  speech  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance  with regard  to  the  government's\r\n\r\neconomic  policy, you will see a paragraph on  the  P.W.D.\r\n\r\nThat  department is short of engineers. It is a recognised\r\n\r\nfact  that  the shortage of technicians is universal.  Yet\r\n\r\nhas  the  P.A.P.  Government ever tried  to  overcome  its\r\n\r\ndifficulties?  No. We know many technicians have  returned\r\n\r\nfrom overseas after completing their studies but they have\r\n\r\nnot   got  jobs  yet.  There  are  many  local  university\r\n\r\ngraduates who have not got employment up till now. This is\r\n\r\nonly  one aspect of the problem. The Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nhas  said  just  now that the attitude of  the  Government\r\n\r\ntowards professional men with regard to treatment and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nremuneration  is the reason why they  have  left  this\r\n\r\ncountry for other places. The Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we  must look after these technicians  and\r\n\r\nprofessional  men properly because all of  us  require\r\n\r\ntheir  services.  We do not care what their  political\r\n\r\nstand is so long as they are loyal to the policies  of\r\n\r\nthe   Government  and  are  able  to  carry  them  out\r\n\r\nproperly. What is the result? Well, we can clearly see\r\n\r\nthat experienced professional men and technicians have\r\n\r\nresigned on a considerable scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us look at the financial\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Minister for last year. This has  never\r\n\r\nbeen  mentioned  in  the current Financial  Statement.\r\n\r\nLast  year  he  said that in a new  country  that  was\r\n\r\ntrying to shake off the shackles of colonial rule,  we\r\n\r\nmust  try  to create equal opportunities  so  that  no\r\n\r\nclass  would  have a privilege over the other  and  we\r\n\r\nmust  try  to  march  as far as  we  could  towards  a\r\n\r\nsocialist objective so that we could have a more  just\r\n\r\nand fair society. \"This policy will be able to rectify\r\n\r\nthe unequal relationship between the employers and the\r\n\r\nemployees.  In  the old country many  workers  had  to\r\n\r\nsuffer  a  great  deal under colonial rule  and  their\r\n\r\nopportunities were very strictly restricted. In  those\r\n\r\ndays  the English-educated were treated very well  and\r\n\r\nthey  were isolated from the rest of society. But  now\r\n\r\nyou  can  see how the P.A.P. Government is  trying  to\r\n\r\ngive  equal opportunities to the Chinese-educated  and\r\n\r\ngraduates of Nanyang University.\" They continue to say\r\n\r\nthat  in a socialist government the government  should\r\n\r\nnot  only  try  to  give  equal opportunities  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious classes of people but must also try to explain\r\n\r\nthe  economy of the country so that everybody will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  make a contribution towards nation building.\r\n\r\n\"Because our population is increasing, we must try  to\r\n\r\ndo our best. This is very clear.\" But in the Financial\r\n\r\nStatement for this year, the Minister for Finance  has\r\n\r\nsaid   nothing   about   this.  This   paragraph   has\r\n\r\ndisappeared  entirely.  Let us  look  at  this  year's\r\n\r\nstatement  again on what he says about the improvement\r\n\r\nof the people's livelihood -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen (Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen):</b> Order. Could the\r\n\r\nMember please inform the House which book he is\r\n\r\nquoting from regarding last year's financial speech?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nsir,  it  is  from the Nanyang Digest,  reporting  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister's speech made in  this  Assembly  in\r\n\r\nregard to the 1960 Financial Statement. He said  there\r\n\r\nwere  three items of tax increases last year. He  said\r\n\r\nthis  new taxation would increase the revenue  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment by $10 million. This burden of taxes is not\r\n\r\nnecessary  hut  this  additional revenue  will  enable\r\n\r\ngreater  development in the building  of  schools  and\r\n\r\nmore  hospitals in the interests of the  people.  That\r\n\r\nmeans  to  say, if you get money from the people,  you\r\n\r\nmust  spend it on the people themselves, so that  they\r\n\r\nwill enjoy a better life. We agree with this principle\r\n\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us look again at the current Budget\r\n\r\nestimates. We find that the revenues for this year are\r\n\r\nquite  considerable and we expect  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nspend a great deal of money out of these revenues  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment purposes. But it is regrettable for me  to\r\n\r\nsay  that this is not the case, because the Government\r\n\r\nhas  not  spent  the people's money  properly  on  the\r\n\r\npeople   themselves,  as  has  been  promised.  Today,\r\n\r\nfrankly  speaking, if we compare the current estimates\r\n\r\nwith  those of last year, we have a feeling that there\r\n\r\nhas  been  no foresight as to how much money  will  be\r\n\r\nspent  for 1961. I wonder how the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\ncan  state  in  the  proper  column  that  the  amount\r\n\r\nactually  spent  is very negligible  compared  to  the\r\n\r\namount  on  expenditure approved by  this  House.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government today is very disappointing to  the\r\n\r\npeople, because in 1959 it promised to do many things.\r\n\r\nAlthough  I  have broken away from the  Government  to\r\n\r\njoin the Barisan Sosialis, I feel that the promises we\r\n\r\nmade in 1959 should be carried out as far as possible,\r\n\r\nand  that  we must pay attention to the implementation\r\n\r\nof the policies as laid down according to the promises\r\n\r\nmade  to  the people. Today, the P.A.P. is  trying  to\r\n\r\nboast  that 1961 is a year of construction, but  I  am\r\n\r\nstill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwondering how this can be true. I will say that this is\r\n\r\nthe last year of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a\r\n\r\nmatter  for  regret that the Budget  debate  is  taking\r\n\r\nplace  ahead of the debate on the Negara's speech.  The\r\n\r\nnormal  parliamentary procedure is  that  the  Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech will provide a debate on the Government's policy\r\n\r\nfor  the  ensuing year, and the Budget is  Government's\r\n\r\nattempt  at  implementing that policy. But now  we  are\r\n\r\ndebating  the  Budget first instead  of  the  Negara's\r\n\r\nspeech  because  of the number of days  we  have  spent\r\n\r\ndebating the merger motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the past two years we have been on this side\r\n\r\nof  the House. We were alone for the first year.  There\r\n\r\nwere  eight of us here and we criticised the Government\r\n\r\nmost vigorously in regard to their Budgets. In 1959, we\r\n\r\nwere  laughed at and ridiculed. Members of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\neven  went  to  the extent of saying how  bad  and  how\r\n\r\nwicked  the Lim Yew Hock Government was and  how  clean\r\n\r\nand  how good the P.A.P. Government was. Then in  1960,\r\n\r\nwhen we had their second Budget, three Members from the\r\n\r\nother side came over to this side, and there was a  lot\r\n\r\nof  noise  going  on - in fact, a lot  of  exposures  and\r\n\r\ncounter-exposures - so  much so that  it  resulted  in  a\r\n\r\nCommission of Inquiry. Then in their third Budget  this\r\n\r\nyear, this side has increased in number and their  side\r\n\r\nhas  decreased. This, however, is not so bad. But  when\r\n\r\nthose  who  came from the other side now say that  what\r\n\r\nthey  said to mean at that time was not what they meant\r\n\r\nto  say, and that what they mean to say now is that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government is a rotten Government and that  the\r\n\r\nsooner  it  gets out the better for all concerned,  and\r\n\r\nhow good the Lim Yew Hock Government was, Sir, I really\r\n\r\nfind   it  difficult  to  reconcile  these  statements.\r\n\r\nAlthough  we  on  this  side of the  House  might  feel\r\n\r\ngratified that our strength has increased, it  is  very\r\n\r\nhard  for me, Sir, to reconcile the statements now made\r\n\r\nby  Members who have come over to this side  when  they\r\n\r\ncriticise the Government's activities during the past\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  years,  with  which activities they  were  closely\r\n\r\nconnected.  Some of them were Parliamentary Secretaries\r\n\r\nand some were very active Back-Benchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.02 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Sir, what I would like to say is\r\n\r\nthis,  before  I  leave this subject.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  was  most violent in his criticism  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for the pay cut. He said that  that  should\r\n\r\nnot  have been done. If I remember rightly, when there\r\n\r\nwere  eight  of us on this side of the House,  we  were\r\n\r\nvery  vehement in our criticism of the arbitrary action\r\n\r\nof  the  Government in imposing the pay cut, and  there\r\n\r\nwere  the  13 Members who are now on this side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  and  who  stood up to say that we  were  talking\r\n\r\nrubbish.  Now they have learnt the error of their  ways\r\n\r\nand  they  criticise  the  Government  for  its  action\r\n\r\nagainst the civil servants, to which action they were a\r\n\r\nparty. Well, perhaps they are now saying they are sorry\r\n\r\nthat  they  had  done  that  and  they  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will learn the error of its ways. It  is  up\r\n\r\nto them. I do not know. The Member for Queenstown stood\r\n\r\nup  this time and criticised the Government. I think he\r\n\r\nsaid  these words, \"They blundered in their Budget  and\r\n\r\nin  their taxation policy,\" and it was only last  year,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Minister  for Finance introduced  eight  new\r\n\r\nforms  of taxes, that the Member for Queenstown  stood\r\n\r\nup  and  said in this Assembly - I think I can  remember\r\n\r\nthe   words   he  said - \"I  unreservedly   support   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\"  It was then last year. This year,  things\r\n\r\nhave  changed  and  maybe they  have  learnt  that  the\r\n\r\ntaxation policy of the Government introduced last  year\r\n\r\nwith their support should not have their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of speakers have touched on the cut in the\r\n\r\nvariable allowance. We are glad that the Government has\r\n\r\nfound  it  necessary  to pay back  the  cut  that  they\r\n\r\nimposed arbitrarily, but it would appear that there  is\r\n\r\nstill  a  lot of heartache amongst the civil  servants.\r\n\r\nThey  maintain - as we have maintained for the  past  two\r\n\r\nyears - that the cut imposed by the Government was an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narbitrary cut and that it was against all trade  union\r\n\r\nprinciples. Any cut which the Government had wanted to\r\n\r\nintroduce  could  have  been introduced  after  proper\r\n\r\nnegotiations with the trade union bodies. The  unions,\r\n\r\nI   understand,  are  now  asking  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate with them with a view to finding  a  way  to\r\n\r\nheal  this sore once and for all. I do urge  upon  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  they  should - if  there  is  such  a\r\n\r\nrequest - negotiate  with  the  unions  and  bring  this\r\n\r\nmatter - which has caused a lot of heartache amongst the\r\n\r\ncivil servants - to an end once and for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we read in the newspapers today that the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade is going on strike. Members will remember that\r\n\r\nfor  the  past two years, I have said in this Assembly\r\n\r\nthat  the  Work  Brigade was just an  attempt  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to build up a -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> A private army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> - Frankenstein. Today it has\r\n\r\nturned  out to be an organisation which has  come  cut\r\n\r\nopenly  because it cannot stand it any more.  It  says\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is bad. I did say a year ago that\r\n\r\nthe  Work  Brigade is nothing but an  attempt  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to impose slave conditions on those who are\r\n\r\nunemployed.  Before the P.A.P. came  into  power,  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government tried to solve  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem  by giving the unemployed relief work  at  the\r\n\r\nrate  of $3 a day plus rice and sugar. When the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncame  into power - the workers' government as they claim\r\n\r\nthemselves  to be - they cut off the rice  and  sugar\r\n\r\nrations  and  now the members of the Work Brigade  are\r\n\r\nonly  paid $1.50 a day. I told the Government that  if\r\n\r\nthey  hoped  to  make use of the Work  Brigade  to  be\r\n\r\npresent at the Airport to welcome Ministers home  when\r\n\r\nthey come back from leave or see them off when they go\r\n\r\nelsewhere, or to make use of leaders of the  community\r\n\r\ncentres  to  cheer them when they walk from  the  City\r\n\r\nHall  to  this  Assembly, that was not going  to  help\r\n\r\nthem;  they would be creating a Frankenstein. We  know\r\n\r\ntoday that the People's Association is out against the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  because they say that  the  P.A.P. is  no\r\n\r\ngood. It is the same thing with the Work Brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us go through the Budget Statement of the\r\n\r\nMinister. The Minister rightly says that in  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve  some success in the industrialisation  policy\r\n\r\nand in the development programme:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...one of the main objectives of the Plan is to\r\n\r\ninduce  an  increase  in the rate of  private  capital\r\n\r\ninvestment.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>He  is quite right. You must induce an increase in the\r\n\r\nrate of private capital investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

That, of course is not a point\r\n\r\nof order. It is a waste of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, I will\r\n\r\nbe  speaking  25  minutes less than my  allotted  time\r\n\r\nagreed  among Opposition Members. But just to cut  the\r\n\r\nstory  short, this is what the Minister says, that  in\r\n\r\norder  to increase the rate of private capital,  there\r\n\r\nmust be an inducement to see that there is an increase\r\n\r\nin  private  investment. But how do they go  about  it\r\n\r\nnow,  Sir? We know in Singapore that there is a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  war  today between the P.A.P.-controlled  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and S.A.T.U. - the Barisan Sosialis-controlled\r\n\r\ntrade  unions. Each group is trying to go all  out  to\r\n\r\nprove that it is the better group. That is why we  are\r\n\r\nhaving a series of strikes today. The P.A.P. tries  to\r\n\r\ndo  something to prove that it is better. The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis might feel that they want to prove that  they\r\n\r\nare  better.  Therefore, they are  creating  all  this\r\n\r\nindustrial unrest. How are they then going  to  induce\r\n\r\nan increase in private investment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was touched upon by the Member for Anson - about\r\n\r\nthe  World Bank having agreed to finance some  of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects. The Minister says at page  9  of\r\n\r\nthe Budget Statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is a source of satisfaction to the Government\r\n\r\nthat  the  World  Bank  has  agreed  to  finance   our\r\n\r\ndevelopment projects, for a World\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBank  loan indicates the confidence of the Bank in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial standing of the Government:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I think it would be more correct to say \"the confidence\r\n\r\nof the Bank in the financial standing of Singapore\" and\r\n\r\nnot \"of the Government\", because the P.A.P. Government is\r\n\r\nnow  going  bankrupt. It started with  43  Members.  It\r\n\r\nbecame 40, then 39, and now it is 26. One more less and\r\n\r\nit will go completely bankrupt. It is just on the verge\r\n\r\nof bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the steel mill, there is one point\r\n\r\nthat has not been touched on, and that is, a steel mill\r\n\r\nis  coming  into existence in Petaling Jaya,  Selangor.\r\n\r\nOne  steel mill there is more than enough to cope  with\r\n\r\nthe  requirements  of Malaya as a whole,  and  even  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  when it takes place. The Japanese steel  mill\r\n\r\nis  out. It is no good. It has no chance. There  is  no\r\n\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to prove that there were more imports, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance says that  the  registration  of\r\n\r\nprivate motor cars, motor-cycles and scooters increased\r\n\r\nby  35 per cent, and yet it has been pointed out by the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson that the revenue from  petroleum  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be $2 million less than is estimated for  this\r\n\r\nyear. What is the reason for it? Diesel? I submit, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat the reason why petrol is being used less today  is\r\n\r\nbecause  of this funny car park business that is  going\r\n\r\non.  Sir,  there  is nowhere to park your  car.  It  is\r\n\r\neasier  for a car-owner not to go by car. It is  easier\r\n\r\nto  travel  by bus or taxi. That is one of the  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  the  petroleum  tax  has gone  down.  It  is  more\r\n\r\nconvenient to travel by bus or taxi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Do not shout.

However, it is necessary that in  debating  the\r\n\r\nBudget  speech  of the Minister for Finance,  I  should\r\n\r\nbring up this point that I feel is important, i.e., the\r\n\r\nsurplus that we find today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the Minister for Finance says\r\n\r\nin  his  speech  that  all the political  slogans  have\r\n\r\nbrought  about results for the benefit of  the  people.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, we must face hard realities and find ways\r\n\r\nand  means  to improve the livelihood of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In  our  efforts to  achieve  progress  for\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  should not forget  important  problems,\r\n\r\nsuch as the composition of a multi-racial society. Each\r\n\r\nproblem  has its own difficulties, and our  first  step\r\n\r\nmust  be  to  get  rid  of the wall  of  division.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  of  uniting our various peoples is  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  task.  If we are unable to break  down  this\r\n\r\ncommunal barrier. I think it will be very difficult for\r\n\r\nus to solve this problem as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my Party, I say again\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  Budget  Statement  of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, there is no mention of how we could solve  this\r\n\r\nproblem, with particular reference to the section  which\r\n\r\nconcerns  by industrialists who are non-Malays, and  in\r\n\r\nthe  effort  to bring about a more egalitarian  society.\r\n\r\nThere is mention of the field of employment. At present,\r\n\r\nunemployed  Malays have no chance to gain employment  in\r\n\r\nindustries or factories, many of which are controlled by\r\n\r\nindustrialists who are non-Malays. If we  could  suggest\r\n\r\nto  the industrialists to take in Malays, it would be  a\r\n\r\nstep  towards  bringing  about closer  relationship  and\r\n\r\nmutual  understanding  between the  various  communities\r\n\r\nwhich  live  in Singapore; like the step  taken  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  today where  industrialists  are\r\n\r\ngiving  more opportunities to the Malays. This  will  at\r\n\r\nleast bring about an understanding in the development of\r\n\r\nindustries in our State and also bring about  the  unity\r\n\r\nof  our  peoples in Malaya. So I hope this  matter  will\r\n\r\nreceive the serious consideration of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot achieve our political and ideological aims\r\n\r\nif  the various peoples in our country cannot be united.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it  is  our aim to bring about  a  more  equal\r\n\r\nsociety,  if  we cannot bring about mutual understanding\r\n\r\namong  the various peoples in all fiel4s, whether it  be\r\n\r\neducational, industrial, etc., I think we cannot achieve\r\n\r\nsocialism.  Although my Party is not a socialist  Party,\r\n\r\nwe must aim at the unity of our peoples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

To  my  mind,  the\r\n\r\nopportunity they have had of putting forward their cause\r\n\r\nby criticising and pointing out the inadequacies of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment in a rational way has been completely lost.  We\r\n\r\nmay  put  the  contributions  we  have  had  from  Members\r\n\r\nopposite in a few categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is the usual political line completely\r\n\r\nunrelated  to  the Budget - to call upon the  Government  to\r\n\r\nresign -  political issues which are completely unconnected\r\n\r\nwith  the  issues before the House. I shall  dismiss  such\r\n\r\ncomments  with, the contempt that they  deserve.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  a  number of Opposition speakers  have  made\r\n\r\nperhaps  well-founded criticisms or  pointed  out  certain\r\n\r\nparts  of the Government's financial policy on which  they\r\n\r\nare not completely clear. Therefore, in the short time  at\r\n\r\nmy  disposals I intend to dwell on the second category  of\r\n\r\nthe remarks by Opposition Members in this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Queenstown falls into the first\r\n\r\ncategory.  We  have wasted nearly an hour on a  thoroughly\r\n\r\nfruitless, bellicose, inaccurate, and illogical address by\r\n\r\nhim.  Surely when you talk about the Budget, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the first thing you have to do is to get your  facts\r\n\r\nand  figures  right.  It is obvious that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  got all his facts muddled up and his  figures\r\n\r\nconfused. His only contribution to this debate - if  we  can\r\n\r\ncall  it  a  contribution - was a long political tirade,  so\r\n\r\nfamiliar with Barisan Sosialis Members containing  nothing\r\n\r\nbut words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim just reiterates in the most\r\n\r\nheinous  and blatant way the untruth that he uttered  last\r\n\r\nyear,  that  the new taxes we introduced were designed  to\r\n\r\ntax  the  poor  and that only $100,000 came from  the  big\r\n\r\nEuropean firms. It is absolutely amazing that a man who is\r\n\r\nan accountant could come to such a conclusion. No basis in\r\n\r\nfact, none in evidence, and none whatsoever in logic. So I\r\n\r\nshall  dismiss  the speeches of these two Members  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly with the contempt that they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose, instead, to discuss here a number of salient\r\n\r\npoints  raised  by  other Members of the Opposition.  They\r\n\r\nare:  first,  the reason for the shortage  in  technicians\r\n\r\nwhich  is  preventing  the  full  implementation  of   our\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan;   second,  the  Economic  Development   Board,   its\r\n\r\nfunctions and programme, and the problems facing  it;  and\r\n\r\nthird,  industrialisation. If I have time,  I  shall  deal\r\n\r\nwith  certain  matters  raised by  the  Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nregarding social insurance, the Work Brigade and  possibly\r\n\r\nsome  matters  raised by the Member  for  Farrer  Park  in\r\n\r\nconnection with loans and subsidies to the Housing  Board,\r\n\r\naccommodation, assessment of empty houses, and  our  plans\r\n\r\nfor the expansion of the water supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, first, the shortage of technicians. That fact is\r\n\r\nadmitted  all  round. The Government has  never  tried  to\r\n\r\nconceal  the  fact  that  there is  a  grave  shortage  of\r\n\r\nengineers,  architects and other grades which is  impeding\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of our Development Plan. It  has  been\r\n\r\nalleged  by some Members that this is due to the  arrogant\r\n\r\nattitude  of the Government and political interference  in\r\n\r\ntechnical matters. Sir, allegations are very easy to make.\r\n\r\nBut  not  the  slightest shred of evidence  has  been  put\r\n\r\nforward  in support of these grave allegations. They  have\r\n\r\nnot  quoted  one  instance  in which  an  engineer  or  an\r\n\r\narchitect  or a quantity surveyor has left the service  of\r\n\r\nthe Government either because of political interference or\r\n\r\nbecause of inadequate pay. But be that as it may, I  think\r\n\r\nI  should  give  some  details of how  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nproposing  to  remedy the situation. I will  talk  on  the\r\n\r\nsubject  in general terms. We have approached a number  of\r\n\r\ngovernments  and asked them to recruit for us  technicians\r\n\r\nin  different  grades.  This is  a  vital  matter  because\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not  we can fulfil the Four-Year  Development\r\n\r\nPlan  depends on whether we can get the skilled men to  do\r\n\r\nit.  So  far  as the present position goes, we  have  made\r\n\r\nfairly  good progress with the U.K. Government. Our  terms\r\n\r\nare these. We say that we are prepared to recruit overseas\r\n\r\nengineers and technicians, but we are not prepared to  pay\r\n\r\nthem  more  than  what we pay our own officers.  Otherwise\r\n\r\nthat  would  be  one  of  the grounds  which  will  breed\r\n\r\ndiscontent, jealousy, a decrease in morale and so on.  The\r\n\r\nBritish Government have agreed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  pay the expatriate element  - what  is\r\n\r\ncalled the inducing element - which includes expatriation\r\n\r\npay,  passages,  home  leave and that  sort  of  thing.\r\n\r\nAgreement would be reached any moment now, after  which\r\n\r\nadvertisements will appear in the newspapers in  London\r\n\r\nand  elsewhere calling for applications to these posts.\r\n\r\nWe have also made some arrangements with the Government\r\n\r\nof  Israel, and, as I mentioned in my Budget Statement,\r\n\r\nwe  have had three technicians so far in the fields  of\r\n\r\nengineering, architecture and so forth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson, in one of his rather high-spirited moments, has ascribed this failure to get\r\n\r\ntechnicians entirely to the arrogance of the P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  the  image  of  Singapore  is  not  an\r\n\r\nattractive one. He may he true. He may have  the  facts\r\n\r\nfor  coming to his conclusions. But let us say this - who\r\n\r\nare  the  persons responsible for creating such  a  bad\r\n\r\npublic image of Singapore abroad?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The P.A.P.!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I say it is the Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  particularly  the  Member  for  Anson  who\r\n\r\ncannot  possibly  control himself. I mean  between  his\r\n\r\ntongue  and his mind there is inadequate co-ordination,\r\n\r\nand  he  speaks  certain things which  his  mind  never\r\n\r\nintends.   These   are  the  people   who,   by   their\r\n\r\nexaggeration,  have created the impression  that  there\r\n\r\nhas   been   political  interference  in   professional\r\n\r\nmatters. These people have never been able td  quote  a\r\n\r\nsingle instance. But the Member for Anson has at  least\r\n\r\nhonestly  pointed out a real reason, and that  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  world-wide  shortage  of  engineers   and\r\n\r\ntechnicians. If you want to have them, you have to  pay\r\n\r\nthe price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Have you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We are negotiating with the\r\n\r\nBritish  Government.  They  are  prepared  to  pay  the\r\n\r\nadditional amount, and if they are prepared to  do  so,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, why should we refuse to  accept  it?\r\n\r\nThis  is  an  absolutely vital point in our Development\r\n\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs  I have mentioned, we have stepped up the awards for\r\n\r\nscholarships in engineering, chemistry and so on and so\r\n\r\nforth - several  posts - but  this  would  not  solve  our\r\n\r\nimmediate problem, because the bright boys and girls we\r\n\r\nsend  abroad now will not be back until about  five  or\r\n\r\nsix  years. In the meantime, we must get these  people.\r\n\r\nIf  we do not succeed to the extent that we wish,  then\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir,I can assure you that it is not  for\r\n\r\nwant of price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Economic Development Board. There has\r\n\r\nbeen  general relief expressed by Members opposite that\r\n\r\nat  last the Board has been established. We have  never\r\n\r\npretended  that it is an easy thing to set up  because,\r\n\r\nas part of our election programme, we said that we were\r\n\r\ngoing  to  set up this Board and provide it  with  vast\r\n\r\nsums  of money - $100 million. If you are going to  give\r\n\r\nan  organisation  a huge sum of money,  you  must  make\r\n\r\nabsolutely  sure that they can spend this money  wisely\r\n\r\nand  for  the purpose for which the money was intended.\r\n\r\nWe  took some two years to set up the Board. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  we  can be accused of being dilatory about  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  We do not pretend to he geniuses who have  the\r\n\r\nright  solution at the finger tips and can  make  vital\r\n\r\ndecisions of great import just off the cuff. We have to\r\n\r\nconsult international experts. And we did. There is  no\r\n\r\nneed  to  apologise for that. And we have set  up  the\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometimes I feel the Member for Anson is saying,\r\n\r\n\"Look,  at  long  last! What have you to  do?\"  I  have\r\n\r\nexplained at great length that the way to do  it  is  a\r\n\r\nstep-by-step  process,  that is,  by  getting  experts,\r\n\r\nsetting up commissions and getting views all round.  We\r\n\r\ntook  a  long  time recruiting personnel. We  have  had\r\n\r\noffers  from various organisations saying, \"  I  think\r\n\r\nthis  man  is  good.\" We rejected  them  after  we  had\r\n\r\ninterviewed  them. We found thqy were not the  sort  of\r\n\r\npeople we think we should have. If we wanted to produce\r\n\r\nquick  results, I would say that the P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nwould  be well advised to follow the techniques or  the\r\n\r\nmethods  of  the Member for Anson. When  he  was  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, I was then a student in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  London School of Economics. One morning, to  my\r\n\r\ncomplete  surprise, I was called to  the  office  and\r\n\r\ntold  that there was a trunk call from Singapore from\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister, and I thought some calamity must\r\n\r\nhave  befallen the country. So I went there, and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson, as Chief Minister, rang me up  and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Look,  a serious decision has been  made.  We\r\n\r\nwant  to appoint an Economic Adviser. Will you please\r\n\r\nask  Professor Arthur Lewis to take on the  job?\"  He\r\n\r\nsaid  the  Professor  was  absolutely  vital  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  The  survival  of  the  State  depended  on\r\n\r\nwhether  Arthur Lewis would take up the  appointment.\r\n\r\nWhereupon  I  took the first train from Lancaster/St.\r\n\r\nPancras  to Birmingham, rang up Professor  Lewis  and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Look,  I  have a proposal to make.  My  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister has asked whether you will take on the job.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  he  said,  \"Yes,  yes. Queer  chap,  your  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister.  He rang me up last night. He  rang  me  up\r\n\r\nwhen  I  was having my bath.\" And he said to me,  \"Go\r\n\r\nhome.  You  know that even if I took on the  job,  it\r\n\r\nwould  not make two pence worth of difference because\r\n\r\nthat is not the sort of thing you want in Singapore.\"\r\n\r\nAs I have said, if we want to proceed with this quick\r\n\r\nmethod of appointing advisers to the Board, we  could\r\n\r\nhave  done  it. But I do not think that is  going  to\r\n\r\nproduce any result at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been alleged by some Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition - although  others  disagree;  they  take  a\r\n\r\ndiametrically  opposite point  of  view - that  we  are\r\n\r\ntrying  to  go  out  of  our way  to  please  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors and foreign capitalists while ignoring  the\r\n\r\nlocal  industrialists. That was the  view,  I  think,\r\n\r\nexpressed by the Member for Queenstown. He quoted  at\r\n\r\nlength  from  our  manifesto, that  we  do  not  need\r\n\r\nforeign  capital, and what are we doing now?  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the Member for Hong Lim,  who  is  more\r\n\r\nworldly  wise  in  his  methods,  because  he  is   a\r\n\r\nbusinessman, - the   Member   for   Queenstown   is   a\r\n\r\ndoctor - knows that local businessmen are merchants and\r\n\r\ntraders  and  they cannot open Factories unless  they\r\n\r\nare guided and assisted. That is our point. There is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnothing we are doing now that contradicts our  policy\r\n\r\nwhich  was  stated at the general elections,  namely,\r\n\r\nthat  our survival did not depend on foreign capital,\r\n\r\nbecause we have a sufficient amount of capital  here.\r\n\r\nBut the foreign manufacturers and industrialists,  as\r\n\r\ndistinct  from  the capital they bring to  Singapore,\r\n\r\ncan  provide  the  know-how. That is important.  Your\r\n\r\nlocal businessman has the capital. But he has no know-how.  That is the point the Member for Hong  Lim  was\r\n\r\nmaking.  Very often the foreign manufacturer,  though\r\n\r\nhe  has  the  know-how,  does not  have  the  capital\r\n\r\nbecause of exchange control, restrictions and various\r\n\r\nother  reasons.  The policy of the Government  is  to\r\n\r\nbring  local businessmen in partnership with overseas\r\n\r\nindustrialists in some form of participation  to  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of both. It is, of course, untrue to say that\r\n\r\nwe  are  neglecting  the  local  industrialists.  The\r\n\r\nmajority of firms receiving pioneer certificates  are\r\n\r\nlocal  firms. The majority of firms for which we  are\r\n\r\nproviding  factory  sites for  industrialisation  are\r\n\r\nlocal  firms.  I  would not agree entirely  with  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim who says that all businessmen are\r\n\r\ncommercial agents, because there is a small - true  it\r\n\r\nis  a  small - but  vigorous  and  expanding  class  of\r\n\r\nChinese  local industrialists. It is our business  to\r\n\r\nencourage them in every way possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an Economic Development Board to give them\r\n\r\nloans  on  reasonable terms v.-high they  cannot  get\r\n\r\nfrom banks, because our banks only give loans against\r\n\r\ntrade  credit - short-term  loans.  Thus  the  Board\r\n\r\ngives  most  valuable  assistance  to  them.  We  are\r\n\r\nstarting  an  Industrial  Research  Unit  which   was\r\n\r\nbrought  up by the Member for Anson. I can  say  that\r\n\r\nthe  target date for starting this unit, as  told  by\r\n\r\nme, would be March next year. Possibly things can  go\r\n\r\nwrong - equipment  may be delayed - in  which  case,  it\r\n\r\nwould be June next year. In this way, we can give our\r\n\r\nindustrialists   assistance - in  technical   know-how,\r\n\r\ncapital  and  advice,  if  needed.  Of  course,   the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board hope  to  have  a  fairly\r\n\r\ncomprehensive consultative service. But here again we\r\n\r\nare held up because we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  recruit really first-class men. We have  been  in\r\n\r\ntouch with the World Bank and the United Nations, but\r\n\r\nit  is  not easy to get good men. If you are prepared\r\n\r\nto  put  up  with second or third-rate men,  you  can\r\n\r\nstart  some  sort  of  service. But  when  industries\r\n\r\nconfront some problems, you will find that they  will\r\n\r\nnot be able to solve them. In fact, for all practical\r\n\r\npurposes, it is not worth setting up the unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will say a few words about the steel\r\n\r\nmill. From what the Members of the Opposition say,  I\r\n\r\ngather the impression that they believe a steel  mill\r\n\r\nto  be something of a gigantic establishment. Is  it?\r\n\r\nIt  need not be so. There is a scale for these  steel\r\n\r\nmills. You can go for blast furnace. Then, of course,\r\n\r\nthere is a certain minimum scale, where, say, half  a\r\n\r\nmillion  tons a year and nothing less than that  will\r\n\r\ndo.  On the other hand, techniques have been deeloped\r\n\r\nwhere  you can go for smaller scale steel mills  with\r\n\r\nevery  prospect  of  success. In this  case,  it  was\r\n\r\nexpressed,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, whether  we  are  ever\r\n\r\ngoing to have a steel mill at all. I mentioned in  my\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement  that we have  brought  together  a\r\n\r\nnumber of local businessmen to start this steel mill.\r\n\r\nThey  have  been negotiating with a Japanese  company\r\n\r\nand  not  the  Government. The  Government  has  been\r\n\r\ntrying  to  bring them together. There are advantages\r\n\r\nin  joint participation, but unfortunately the  local\r\n\r\nmen  thought  that the terms of the Japanese  company\r\n\r\nfor  capital  participation were too stiff.  So  they\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Well, we just run the show ourselves.\" This is\r\n\r\nnot  Government putting up the money and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nyou  do not know whether you will succeed or not. But\r\n\r\nthese  are  hardheaded businessmen, two of  whom  are\r\n\r\nabroad  now, ordering plant, interviewing  applicants\r\n\r\nfor  posts arid so on. They are putting up about  $10\r\n\r\nmillion   in  this  project.  Let  us  say   when   a\r\n\r\nbusinessman  puts up that amount of money,  he  would\r\n\r\nhave a shrewd idea that it is workable, feasible  and\r\n\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social insurance is a subject so dear to the heart\r\n\r\nof  the Member for Anson. Then, of course, as a great\r\n\r\nhumanitarian,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  could  not  feel otherwise than  to  deplore  the\r\n\r\ndistress, suffering and poverty of those who are  not\r\n\r\nfortunate. Sir, I think the matter was discussed once\r\n\r\nin   this  House  and  reasons  were  given  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  finds  it difficult to proceed  with  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of social insurance. I can  assure  you,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, that it is not because I am utterly\r\n\r\ndevoid of human feeling, as has been expressed by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown, who thinks I am just a  chess\r\n\r\nplayer, a calculator -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Zugzwang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - and even the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nthought  that I could do more with warmth of feeling.\r\n\r\nBut,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, when you start, this  social\r\n\r\nsecurity  scheme, it is absolutely  vital  that  your\r\n\r\nworkers and their leaders accept social insurance  as\r\n\r\nsocial security. If they do not accept it, then I say\r\n\r\nit  is utterly fruitless; first, if it is just an act\r\n\r\nof  paternalism, which we are now aiming to  do,  and\r\n\r\nsecondly, they will oppose it and if there are  ways,\r\n\r\njam up the administration -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> What about the employers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Nobody, of course, is, Sir, I\r\n\r\nmyself  had  a series of discussions with illustrious\r\n\r\ntrade union leaders such as Mr Lim Ching Siong,  Mr\r\n\r\nWoodhull, Mr Dominic Puthucheary and others,  and  I\r\n\r\nput  forth  before them proposals, not in  principle,\r\n\r\nbut  a  cut  and  dried administrative scheme.  Oddly\r\n\r\nenough, Dominic's brother, James, the Chairman of the Central Provident Fund -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Ex-chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - ex-chairman - had worked out\r\n\r\nthis  scheme.  We said, \"Well, let us introduce  this\r\n\r\nthing\", and they said, \"No.\" What was the outcome  of\r\n\r\nit?  This is for the benefit of the workers  and  the\r\n\r\nState, because then you will do away with one of  the\r\n\r\nmost  important reasons for industrial  strife,  that\r\n\r\nis,  redundancy.  Sir,  they said,  \"No.\"  There  are\r\n\r\nreasons - genuine or not, it is not for me to say. They\r\n\r\nsay we cannot persuade the workers to make their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontribution. They say if you give it to  them  free,\r\n\r\nthat  is  another matter. But, Sir, social  insurance\r\n\r\nmeans the beneficiary must make a contribution.  Then\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  are theirs as of right, unlike  public\r\n\r\nassistance where there is no contribution. When a man\r\n\r\naccepts  public  assistance, there  is  something  of\r\n\r\ncharity  about it which does not taste right  in  the\r\n\r\nmouth.  Therefore, social insurance. I  say  if  such\r\n\r\nillustrious  trade union leaders do not  want  social\r\n\r\nsecurity for the workers, it is hardly fair  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Mr Speaker, Sir, to introduce  it.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis never stop reminding us how close we\r\n\r\nare  to the masses. Let them decide. The moment  they\r\n\r\nsay  they  want it, well, implementation is merely  a\r\n\r\ntechnical problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

No more than we are going to chase  student\r\n\r\npickets by force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

There\r\n\r\nmay  be trouble there. A statement which causes great\r\n\r\nhilarity,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ncircles - I  do  not  know whether  I  should  put  any\r\n\r\ninterpretation on it - but that is past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Brigade was conceived as an unemployment\r\n\r\nassistance scheme. There were thousands of young  men\r\n\r\nand  women coming out to work but are unable to  find\r\n\r\nwork.  What are they going to do? They loiter around.\r\n\r\nSo we say, give them work to do, organise camps, feed\r\n\r\nthem,  discipline their lives, get them to do  useful\r\n\r\nwork,  pay  them out of consideration a  daily  rated\r\n\r\nallow-a  flee. That is the way the Work  Brigade  was\r\n\r\norganised  and  conceived. They are  not  a  fulltime\r\n\r\nworking   force  because  it  is  out  intention   - [Interruption]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> - that they stay in the Work\r\n\r\nBrigade  perhaps 3 months or 6 months  or  9  months,\r\n\r\nduring  which time we hope to find them jobs  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment service or the statutory authorities. This\r\n\r\nis  the period when they are trained and given useful\r\n\r\nwork,  when  their  aptitudes  can  be  assessed  and\r\n\r\ntraining courses organised for them to fit those  who\r\n\r\nare  more  able  for  productive work.  The  type  of\r\n\r\nproject that the Work Brigade is allotted to  do  and\r\n\r\nthe  method  of  carrying out the work  has  been  so\r\n\r\ndesigned that you use the largest possible number  of\r\n\r\nhands with the minimum amount of machinery. The  cost\r\n\r\ndoes  not  matter. If we say this is a  Work  Brigade\r\n\r\nproject,  digging a ditch or putting a road,  and  we\r\n\r\nneed  not want to do it in the cheapest way,  we  can\r\n\r\nlet it out on contract, as the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nsays,  which  is the thing to do. It  will  save  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  money. But, Sir, we have to do  something\r\n\r\nfor  these  young  men and women who otherwise  would\r\n\r\njust  be  cooling  their heels. We were  hoping  that\r\n\r\ndiscipline  could  help the Work Brigade  develop  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  could find employment for them not only  in\r\n\r\nGovernment  service  but also in private  employment.\r\n\r\nThey  can choose whichever form of private employment\r\n\r\nthat pays. They can say yes or no. Unfortunately, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, for reasons which I will  not  discuss\r\n\r\nnow, the members of the Brigade have different views\r\n\r\non   the  subject.  They  think  they  are  full-time\r\n\r\nworkers. If we are to treat them as fully paid  full-time  workers,  I will say, all right, two-thirds  of\r\n\r\nthem  would go, in fact: probably the whole bunch  of\r\n\r\nthem  would  go because we could carry  on  with  the\r\n\r\nprojects  far  cheaper by using  ordinary  commercial\r\n\r\nmethods. The project, therefore, is a temporary phase\r\n\r\nwhere a young man does some work, lives a disciplined\r\n\r\ncamp life, has a chance of getting instruction. It is\r\n\r\nnot  employment  in the sense that others  have  some\r\n\r\nwork  result. It is quite different. We  have  found\r\n\r\npermanent  jobs  for more than 1,000 members  of  the\r\n\r\nWork  Brigade in the two years, and I say that  is  a\r\n\r\ngood record. To that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextent  we have established a Work Brigade which  has\r\n\r\nfulfilled  our  original objective.  Therefore,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen these people have the idea that they should form\r\n\r\nunions  and  that they should find more pay,  and  if\r\n\r\nthey  do  press  their point, Mr Speaker  (no  doubt\r\n\r\nthere  are  less well intentioned people behind  them\r\n\r\negging them on to it), then I say the solution is  to\r\n\r\nclose down the Work Brigade and save money. So I  say\r\n\r\nthat  those  members who are now being  misguided  by\r\n\r\nvarious persons should rethink the whole position. It\r\n\r\ngives  us  no pleasure, Sir, to close down the  camps\r\n\r\nbecause  we want to provide useful work and  activity\r\n\r\nfor  these  people. But they are not doing  full-time\r\n\r\nwork. It is not a full-time proper career. Because if\r\n\r\nthat  was  so,  the  whole modus  operandi  would  be\r\n\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have only two minutes to go and there are\r\n\r\nsome  4 or 5 other topics to go through. I would have\r\n\r\nliked  to deal with the subject raised by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park, because I think it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis an important issue, particularly the future of the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities Board, and an expansion scheme  for\r\n\r\nwater  and light. Unfortunately, time does not permit\r\n\r\nme to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the request that we should reappraise the\r\n\r\nassessment of empty houses, I have already said in my\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement last year that should  there  be  a\r\n\r\nstate  where large numbers of houses are  left  empty\r\n\r\nbecause  the  housing shortage has been overcome,  or\r\n\r\nany other reason, then the position will be reviewed.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Member for Farrer Park thinks that  we  have\r\n\r\nreached  that stage, then I say the Government  would\r\n\r\nhe well advised to examine this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy of\r\n\r\nthe Government for the year 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That this Assembly do now adjourn.\"-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Eight o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1961/19611207/19611207-HA-0151623.pdf\"\">Estimates of Expenditure of the State of Singapore 1962 and Development Estimates of the State of Singapore for 1962 (Cols 1623-1628)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
