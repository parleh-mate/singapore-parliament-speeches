FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Residential property prices<br>\r\n</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan):</B> Sir, Minister Mah gave a robust and immaculate defence of HDB&rsquo;s housing policies last week despite the controversial and divisive nature of the topic.&nbsp;He has also shown flexibility in adjusting those policies to plug gaps that have emerged, such as the&nbsp;HDB concessionary loans for&nbsp;second purchase.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have one point to add to the cash-over-valuation (COV) issue.&nbsp;COV is \"uniquely Singapore\".&nbsp;No other jurisdiction has anything like it. As an ex-practising valuer, I am puzzled by it. If there is widespread occurrence of COVs for particular flat types or locations, the COVs should form part of the evidence that constitute the basis of the valuation.&nbsp;In other words, unless the market goes totally ballistic, valuations should move up and reduce the COVs. It would therefore be an anomaly if COV persists. I urge the HDB to review the entire COV issue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have a point to add to the issue of speculation in the HDB market.&nbsp;Based on anecdotal evidence, there are HDB flat owners who sublet their entire flat in contravention of HDB rules.&nbsp;I have come to know of an estate agent who owns five private properties, who bought a resale flat and promptly sublet the entire flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;His daughter and grandmother were also found to have done the same thing.&nbsp; Such \"unnatural\" demand also helps to fuel price rises.&nbsp;For the rules to be effective, HDB must enforce them vigilantly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the subject of private property, though I must add that the public and private housing markets are not distinct but interrelated and interacts&nbsp;with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The complaints aired in recent months &ndash; rising property prices, project sell-outs &ndash; are symptomatic of short-term dislocations between the housing market and the overall economy. However, if overall economic growth and property prices continue to diverge for a prolonged period, we run the risk of blowing a real estate bubble, just like that in the US. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government&rsquo;s recent interventions to cool the housing market albeit in a calibrated manner to avert a property bubble is thus welcome.&nbsp;Coming down with a sledge hammer could lead to a property market crash which is equally, if not, even more unwelcome as this would also have a domino effect on the rest of the economy. The Government would have to continue to vigilantly&nbsp; monitor the market and act to remove any speculative tendencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to highlight one trend which I consider unhealthy &ndash; the proliferation of Mickey Mouse housing units.&nbsp;Profit-maximising developers want to push dollars per-square-feet of every unit up.&nbsp;The way to do so without hurting sales is to reduce unit sizes to make them \"affordable\" on a lump sum basis. Touting such high&nbsp;dollar&nbsp;per-square-feet prices can also influence buyers in the highly sentiment driven market and give the perception that property prices are experiencing steep price rises.&nbsp;The headline screams, \"$1,634 per-square-foot for a unit in leafy Siglap.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Ministry to guard against and/or calibrate the proliferation of such units.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Property prices</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</B> Sir, I shall talk about more measures to curb property prices.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in order to curb property prices from&nbsp;escalating further, I would suggest that the three-year minimum observation period for sale of each HDB flat only be imposed on permanent residents (PRs) and foreigners, and not on Singapore citizens.

Coupled with a significant number of foreign buyers and high ownership mobility, our local property market can be quite easily heated up.&nbsp;To complicate matters, we do have <I>en bloc</I> fevers from time to time that cause short-term distortions to the market.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last few months, I have heard remarks from friends and&nbsp;in the community such as \"just close your eyes and buy, and it would not go wrong!\",&nbsp;or at the launches, you hear \"no cheque book, no deal\", or even some issuing signed blank cheques for property launches. As a result of buoyant activities, prices have moved up sharply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was in sharp contrast to last year's COS debate where we were talking about how to help the real estate industry tide through the downturn. Despite a still sluggish economy which is recovering from one of our sharpest recessions, the property market rebounded very strongly in the second half of last year. Once again, our property market has demonstrated its highly volatile nature. Is this a case of a demand-supply mismatch?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I am glad that the Government has come up with the recent cooling off measures and urge the Government to continue to watch the market closely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A highly volatile property market is unhealthy for the economy. It may result in more capital and resources being allocated to this sector and thereby depriving long-term investments in other productive sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister to give his thoughts on the state of the current property market. In particular, I hope that the Minister can address the fundamental question as to whether there is sufficient supply to meet the demand in the next one to&nbsp;two years. Are there unusually large numbers of foreign buyers coming to the market and are they one of the causes for the&nbsp;rising prices? Is there evidence of unhealthy speculation in the market?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister how the Government determines whether the property market is speculative, bubbly or overheating? What are the key indicators and references that the Government uses? Would it be better if the Government adopt a more transparent approach and communicate these to the market? I believe more information and communication will lead to&nbsp;less volatility as well as reduce second-guessing by the market players and participants?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also hope that Government can look at ways to pre-empt another emergence of the so called \"<I>en bloc</I> fever\". Excessive <I>en bloc</I> activity could cause distortions to the property market and add volatility in the short term. If too widespread, it is a negative externality to the economy as it adds upward pressure on costs in a tight labour market condition and can contribute to further bottlenecks in the construction industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, <I>en bloc</I> related construction activity can be harmful in many other ways. To the environment, it is extremely wasteful to tear down and rebuild buildings in otherwise great condition. We have also read about how <I>en bloc</I> sales at private estates have heightened tensions and stirred up conflict among neighbours, residents and developers. Some of these disputes end up being played up in the courts, costing involved parties more money and stress. This would certainly destroy the social cohesion that we are trying to foster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel strongly that the Government should look into the <I>en bloc</I> rules and look into ways to slow excessive and wasteful <I>en bloc</I> activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Limited land resources</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with only about 710 square kilometers and a residing population of almost&nbsp;five&nbsp;million coupled with the aspiration to be one of the leading economic powerhouses in Asia and in the world, land use planning in Singapore is probably the most challenging task of any land planners in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, we have to salute the land planners at the Ministry of National development (MND) and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for having done a great job for Singapore since independence. Singapore is now a great place to live, work and play in Asia despite&nbsp;our tight land constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, our limited land resources will be increasingly squeezed again as we embarked on the next phase of economic growth, to be a distinctive global city. How do we plan even smarter so that the land constraint would not impede our future growth and progress? What are our options &ndash;&nbsp;short term and long term?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) has also come up with recommendations. I would like to hear also&nbsp;Government's response to the&nbsp;recommendations, and in particular how would the emphasis of land productivity impact the cost of industrial land.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports and Minister for Transport (Mr Teo Ser Luck)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Concept plan 2011 &ndash; Singapore's future</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports and Minister for Transport (Mr Teo Ser Luck):</B> Sir, three years I signed up for a marathon. In all the marathons I have run, there are white strips after white strips on the road. It is a very long road when you think about 42 kilometers of running. But I was actually looking forward to this marathon. It can lead me from one place to another on a pavement, instead of the road. So it led me from the coast, to the lagoon, then to the HDB flats, ran beside the coffee-shops, back to the beach, go into the residential area and finally to the end point. This is what we call pavement running or now popularly-known, park connectors.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also very excited that the Ministry of National Development (MND) is talking about building an entire park connector round-island pavement of 150 kilometers. When that is up, you can imagine that families can go trekking for three days two nights&nbsp;&ndash; around Singapore, going through industrial areas, residential areas, HDB heartlands, into the city and back to their home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have lived in two other cities for a period of time. These cities are filled with a lot of energy and&nbsp;business life, but also a lot of people. However, they have vast land and nature. That is something that Singapore does not have in natural reserves, vast land or nature. But, then, I would say that the credit goes to&nbsp;the Singapore Government and the Ministry of National Development for doing very careful planning to keep our rustic nature. The other day, I signed up for another long distance race of 25 kilometres, that is to run the trails&nbsp;from MacRitchie Reservoir, to Peirce Reservoir, into Bukit Timah, and back. That was only 25 kilometres, but the longest distance is about 100 kilometres. That 100 kilometres takes you round two loops of 50 kilometres. Singapore does have 50 kilometres of trails,&nbsp;and I am not sure if many Singaporeans know that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not just an urban city, we actually have very good reserves and&nbsp;nature to enjoy. I am glad that MND has now launched the Concept Plan 2011 public consultation to plan for the next 50 years. To me, it is a very important project, as a nature-lover and an outdoor-activist. This is not just to plan the infrastructure to contain the population, but it is also to meet the aspirations of citizens like me for quality living, so that they can have&nbsp;the rootedness and sense of belonging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we face many challenges, because we have land constraint, a really&nbsp;dense population, changing demographics,&nbsp;an increasingly greying population, a different population mix and&nbsp;environmental changes. I hope that the Concept Plan 2011 has considered all these factors and discussed these issues as well, and how we can overcome these challenges. There will be many trade-offs as you decide how best to position Singapore&nbsp;in land planning, both as a home and as a place for business. There is no easy solution.&nbsp; That is why the Concept Plan 2011 is important as it looks at the next 40, 50 years to answer these questions. I really hope that you would be able to do the forward planning as well as we did 40 years ago and achieve the same success.&nbsp;Singaporeans will continue to find Singapore a place they can identify with, be proud of and make it their home.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Effective land use</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast):</B> Mr Chairman, Singapore's growing population&nbsp;exerts increasing demand on land use for housing.

What is MND's take on this retirement village concept this year, this time?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng, take your two cuts together.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Giving soul to the city</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</B> Sir, Singapore seems to be sprouting giant shopping malls everywhere. And now, oversized Integrated Resorts. They scream that we are a consumer city&nbsp;&ndash; even a copy-cat city.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You see&nbsp;the same offerings at any other large city in the world. They say nothing about our cultural heritage or our distinctive character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to inject more soul into the city. We should identify more heritage areas and create a buzz around them while preserving their authentic, old-world charm.&nbsp;This should be done in an integrated masterplan, involving not only the hardware of buildings, but also the software to give the area its own personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A great example is Haji Lane and&nbsp;Arab Street&nbsp;&ndash; pulsing with the energy of our vibrant culture. A not-so-good example is Boat Quay. Visitors walking along the promenade today will not get a sense of its history. They would not know that it was once a major port in Singapore, or one of the most popular sites for Chinese street story-telling, stunts&nbsp;and opera performances. Why not build a maritime museum along the river and also bring back the aura of that history?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also be innovative and creative. Why not use our Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) gantries, bus stops, MRT stations, even rubbish bins, to display our heritage and creativity?&nbsp; Work with our local artists to hand paint on them. For example, the bus stops and ERP gantries in Orchard Road can have an orchard theme. Those in Chinatown can have a Chinese theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is by involving people that the city evolves its personality. We should also allow people to adopt benches to commemorate a person or an event. For example, a husband can sponsor a bench in Boat Quay in memory of his wife because they used to date there regularly.&nbsp; Others reading the inscriptions would connect with the gesture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is our unique history, cultural diversity and the human touches which would give the city personality and soul. Then perhaps one day, our slogan can be \"Singapore: The City with Soul\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Green spaces and coastal areas</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, go to the East Coast Park on any weekend and you can see crowds of people jostling for space&nbsp;&ndash; walking, jogging, cycling, roller-blading, camping, fishing, flying kites, and so on.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All over the island, our parks, beaches and other recreational spaces are getting&nbsp;over-crowded.&nbsp; It is good that more people are into outdoor activities. However, the whole idea of being outdoors is to have a sense of freedom and space, and to connect with nature.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to provide more areas for our often-stressed Singaporeans to get away from it all. Reports about a man with this big problem of not knowing where&nbsp;to row his own <I>kayak</I>, and the rise in illegal fishing, point to the need to give more thought to this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry has done a good job of turning this island into a garden city. I especially commend it for building the park connectors. Like Member Teo Ser Luck, I have also enjoyed it tremendously, cycling from East Coast to Changi Village and marvelling&nbsp;at the natural beauty around us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask for an update of the&nbsp;work to link up the major parks, nature reserves and housing estates throughout the island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the main island, more should be done to develop our offshore islands into recreational areas, where people can swim, <I>kayak</I>&nbsp;and island-hop.&nbsp; But please do&nbsp;not turn them into another Sentosa, which has an artificial plastic feel about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was in Koh Samui and Phuket, it was easy to hop from island to island on a boat, and to swim and snorkel.&nbsp; However, the experience was somewhat marred by the&nbsp;hordes of tourists, the pollution of the boat&nbsp;engines and the destruction of corals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we should use our own parks and coastal areas to teach Singaporeans, especially the children, to respect the environment and to love nature.

First of all, Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about our land use planning policies.&nbsp; I would like to assure him that the Ministry of National Development's land use policies will be geared towards supporting the economic recovery which has just started and also the ESC's recommendations to build a distinctive global city for all.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, we will continue to maintain a stable property market which will underpin the economic recovery.&nbsp; Mr Liang asked what are the indicators or fundamentals that Government looks at to determine if the property market is bubbly.&nbsp; We do look at several indicators including price increases, transactions, sub-sales, and so on.&nbsp; We do not have a specific set of indicators or trigger points that say that we should do certain things when some things happen. We are not on auto-pilot, in that sense.&nbsp;It is not only looking at indicators but having a sense of judgment as to what is likely to happen in the months going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of that monitoring, we assessed that there was a high risk that a property bubble would be forming.&nbsp;In February, we introduced two measures to temper sentiments in the market. One was the decrease in the Loan to Value (LTV) ratio and the second was the imposition of a seller stamp duty.&nbsp;Why did we do this?&nbsp;Because in January, price increases had been strong and also the transactions were also at&nbsp;a&nbsp;high and the risk of over-heating was high.&nbsp;A property correspondent in <I>Zaobao</I> named <I>Wu Hui Min</I> put it this way:&nbsp;it is far better to take the <I>liang cha</I> (or cooling tea) now rather to take the <I>tui shou yao</I> (or aspirin) later on when the market is over-heated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chiam had asked for more measures to curb property prices.&nbsp; I also remember Mr Hri Kumar&nbsp;asking for more severe measures to deter speculation.&nbsp; Let me say that we do not intend to introduce more measures for now but we will monitor the market closely.&nbsp; And if there are signs that the market will over-heat again, we are ready to introduce additional measures to stabilise the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor asked a specific question about what she calls \"Mickey Mouse\" units, extra small units.&nbsp; My view is that, beyond ensuring market stability, we should let market forces determine prices and also the type of unit sizes that they want to develop.&nbsp;But I do agree that the headlines about these units' high price per square foot (psf) are indeed misleading.&nbsp;I would suggest that we do more to educate consumers not to take such headlines at face value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second area of land use planning I want to emphasise is adequate land supply.&nbsp; We will ensure that there is an adequate supply of land to support economic growth.&nbsp; Mr Liang asked about foreign property buyers and also about whether the Government can provide more property market information.&nbsp; Singapore is a key city in growing Asia.&nbsp; I think it is understandable and natural and, indeed, not a bad thing that there is foreign interest in private residential properties here.&nbsp; But having said that, properties in Singapore will still remain largely in the hands of Singaporeans. Singapore residents last year accounted for close to 90% of all private property housing transactions.&nbsp; In the public housing market, the bulk of it is owned and occupied by Singaporeans.&nbsp;The Government will continue to ensure that there is adequate supply of private housing to meet the needs of both locals and foreigners through the Government Land Sales Programme which we announce twice a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;URA also releases property market information to the public regularly. There is ample supply of private housing in the pipeline to meet demand over the next one to two years.&nbsp; Buyers need not rush into the market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang also asked about further steps to pre-empt <I>en bloc</I> fevers. As he knows, this is under the purview of the Ministry of Law (MinLaw). MinLaw has been reviewing existing <I>en bloc</I>&nbsp;legislation and taken into account the feedback and the suggestions from the&nbsp;public. Any changes to <I>en bloc</I> rules will be made by MinLaw in due course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also continue to ensure that we have an adequate supply of commercial space in terms of both quantity as well as mix to support the ESC's objective which is to nurture a diverse eco-system of enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In previous years, in the Committee of Supply, I had mentioned that we are planning to develop new growth areas in Jurong Gateway, Paya Lebar Central and also the Kallang Riverside. Despite the downturn, we have pressed on with infrastructure works and more sites at these areas will be progressively released for sale for development from this year onwards. Together with the grade \"A\" office spaces in the Central Business District&nbsp;(CBD), they will offer commercial firms more choice in business locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will further catalyse growth at Jurong Gateway and Paya Lebar Central by relocating several Government agencies out of the central area to Jurong as well as Paya Lebar.&nbsp; My Ministry, the Ministry of National Development, and our statutory boards, AVA and BCA, will move to Jurong Gateway by 2015. The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources and its statutory boards, PUB and NEA, are also planning to join us in Jurong.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Workforce Development Agency (WDA) will move to Paya Lebar Central.&nbsp; Its new Continuing Education and Training (CET) campus that is targeted to complete by the end of 2013 will also be located there.&nbsp; The relocation of Government agencies will free up prime office space in the city to meet private sector demand.&nbsp; By 2015, we expect the current supply of one million square metres of office space in the pipeline would have been taken up. These relocations will be timely and will help to free up more space for the private sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we will make the supply of land more responsive to the market with three improvements to the reserve list system.&nbsp; First, with immediate effect, we will reduce the deposit required from successful applicants of reserve list sites from 5% to 3% of the minimum bid, subject to a cap of $5 million&nbsp;to reduce the cashflow burden to successful applicants.&nbsp; Second, we will henceforth consider releasing a reserve list for sale immediately if there is more than one party that submits a minimum bid that is close to the Government's reserve price for the site within a reasonable period.&nbsp; As Members may know, prior to this, a site is released for sale only if a developer submits a minimum bid which is equal to or higher than the reserve price.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we will make available a larger supply and wider variety of sites in the reserve list in the second half 2010 to give developers more choice.&nbsp; The second half&nbsp;2010 Government's land sales will be announced somewhere towards the end of June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on the Concept Plan 2011.&nbsp; Several Members, including Mr Teo Ser Luck, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Ms Jessica Tan and&nbsp;Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked how we can tackle the land constraints and growth and still make sure that the infrastructure that we provide enables our population to enjoy a good standard of living.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have an integrated planning system.&nbsp;This is a very holistic system that involves all Government agencies and it guides the staging of land as well as the infrastructure development. MND and URA have embarked on the Concept Plan 2011 Review.&nbsp;We do a Concept Plan Review every 10 years, so the next one is 2010 Concept Plan Review and this Review will chart our land use strategies over the next 40 to 50 years&nbsp;&ndash; 2050 and beyond.&nbsp; The developments that we see around us today, whether it is Changi Airport, the MRT network, Marina Bay, all these are developments that we enjoy today because of the work that went into previous Concept Plan Reviews.&nbsp;Similarly, the Concept Plan 2011 Review will highlight certain areas of growth and certain areas for development that we will see in the next 20, 30, 40 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our objectives for Concept Plan 2011 are very simple.&nbsp; We want to support growth but, at the same time, we want to maintain a quality living environment.&nbsp; Under the Review, we will develop strategies to increase land productivity to support future growth. This was one of the recommendations of the ESC.&nbsp;It means intensifying land use as well as rejuvenating existing land, make better, make productive use of existing land for higher values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to ESC's recommendation, we will study the development of a new waterfront city at Tanjong Pagar and Pulau Brani.&nbsp; But this will only take place after 2027 when the lease for the port of land&nbsp;&ndash; which PSA currently holds&nbsp;&ndash; runs out and PSA moves out.&nbsp; We will then identify opportunities to rejuvenate mature industrial estates as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the Government plans for land use and infrastructure at the macro level, I think Members rightly pointed out that we should also not lose sight of the micro level and so we should leverage on the market to allocate scarce land resources to the most productive uses.&nbsp; We have studied ways to inject greater flexibility into&nbsp;land zoning so that our land use system can be more responsive to the changing needs of our economy.&nbsp; Here, I hasten to add that we have to do so in a very targeted way because land zoning is still relevant and it is still an important aspect of our&nbsp;land use policies because it helps to protect the amenities of the residents and the landowners in the area.&nbsp; It also ensures that we have sufficient and adequate land to meet various needs in the future, including industrial needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also study new ways to create land and space. We have reclaimed land&nbsp;over the last 40, 50 years.&nbsp;There is still scope to reclaim land. But there is a physical limit to how much land we can reclaim due to the availability of sea space and also to the technical constraints of reclamation. The same consideration applies to floating structures.&nbsp;There have been some suggestions that we should make more use of floating structures.&nbsp; But scarcity of sea space as much as scarcity of land space means that we do not have as much flexibility in this area.&nbsp;What we can do is try to build as much as possible upwards and this we have done.&nbsp;When the last Concept Plan Review was made 10 years ago, there was already a suggestion that we should increase our plot ratios and build more developments upwards.&nbsp; But we will also be studying new ways to build downwards, to use underground space and synergise new underground spaces with the space above ground and the surrounding developments &ndash; the underground Science City at Kent Ridge is one example of what we can do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In parallel, we will examine new strategies under the Concept Plan Review to improve the quality of living in Singapore.&nbsp;This Review will take into account our changing demographic profile and it will ensure that there are adequate social facilities&nbsp;&ndash; housing, leisure, healthcare, etc, to support our future population. In this regard, I want to address specifically Dr Fatimah Lateef's question about retirement village. She has asked this several times.&nbsp;I want to point out that we do have our own version of a retirement village. It is not the sprawling retirement villages that we see in&nbsp;USA or Australia but it is our version.&nbsp; HDB&nbsp;has built \"studio apartments\".&nbsp;Our studio apartments cater to the housing needs of the elderly and there are provisions for social amenities, VWOs, etc, in the vicinity that help to look after the social and medical needs of the elderly.&nbsp;At the same time, in response to requests from some developers, we released the site at Jalan Jurong Kechil which can be triggered for a private retirement housing development. This site has not yet been triggered and there have been proposals to extend the lease of this site from 30 years to 60 years which we are considering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just add that we are unique in that a large segment of our population own their homes.&nbsp; Eighty per cent own HDB flats and others own private properties.&nbsp; It is not just a hardware response that we should be looking at but also software enhancements, meaning how do we allow the elderly to age in the homes that they already own and this, again, Mr Lim Boon Heng's Committee on Ageing is looking at it, together with the Ministry of National Development, MCYS and&nbsp;MOH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to Ms Irene Ng's comment about safeguarding nature areas, I would like to assure her that we will continue to safeguard nature areas in the Concept Plan.&nbsp; We are not blessed with the crystal blue waters of Koh Samui but we do have nature areas that we want to preserve and what precious little we have, we will look after for our future generations.&nbsp; NParks will step up public education on biodiversity&nbsp; conservation.&nbsp; This year is the International Year of Biodiversity (IYOB) and NParks will be rolling out a series of programmes in conjunction with the IYOB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, ultimately, quality of living is subjective.&nbsp;As part of the Concept Plan process, we will consult the public on how we can enhance the quality of living in Singapore.&nbsp; We will certainly take note of Ms Irene Ng's suggestions on developing our islands but land constraint is a reality for us.&nbsp;Through innovative land use such as developing eco-links to serve as Park Connectors,&nbsp;animals&nbsp;can move from one part of the reserve to another. It also helps to enhance biodiversity.&nbsp;In this way we can marry recreation as well as conservation objectives.&nbsp;But we will inevitably have to make tradeoffs at each stage of our development between conservation and development among housing needs, leisure needs, industry needs.&nbsp;These are the tradeoffs we need to make to ensure that we develop in a more sustainable way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, 2010 will be a milestone year in the remaking of our city.&nbsp; Singaporeans can look forward to many improvements in our cityscape and their immediate neighbourhoods.&nbsp; Developments are not just in downtown but also in the heartlands as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me highlight&nbsp;plans for the downtown.&nbsp; By the middle of this year, the Marina Bay Promenade will be open.&nbsp;Singaporeans will be able to enjoy a 3.5-kilometre stroll, starting from our first Ark&nbsp;Park, next to the Marina Bay floating platform, over the double Helix Bridge and onto the waterfront promenade fronting the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort.&nbsp; This stroll will end at the Marina Bay's financial centre where phase one of the project will be completed this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also invest more in the software programming to activate key areas in our city. I think it is very clear to us that just hardware alone will not do.&nbsp; URA has planned a series of events called the Marina Bay Invitations 2010 to inject buzz and excitement into the Bay.&nbsp; This includes a mass walkathon and carnival, an urban light festival as well as the annual Marina Bay Singapore Countdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides Marina Bay, concrete improvements will be made to other places in Singapore.&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng asked how we can enhance our heritage areas.&nbsp; For her information, URA has conserved some 7,000 buildings since 1989 and identified 15 areas that are socially significant.&nbsp; Many of these places have been physically enhanced under URA's Active, Liveable and Endearing (ALIVE)&nbsp;community programme which upgrades waterfront areas, enhance community spaces and improve amenities in these familiar places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some examples of these projects completed under ALIVE&nbsp;by URA&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;together with other agencies like PUB&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;include the Changi Point Coastal Walk, the Southern Ridges, Siglap Village.&nbsp; These are places that have become very popular among Singaporeans and tourists and more such improvement projects are in the pipeline.&nbsp; Over at Upper Serangoon Road, pedestrians also enjoy wider walkways and large landscaping.&nbsp; The Member of Parliament for the area, Ms Cynthia Phua and her grassroots members have suggested installing&nbsp;storyboard markers and sculptures to depict the rich local history in the area and URA would be taking up those suggestions.&nbsp; In Geylang Serai, we will commence works this year on a new pedestrian mall which will provide space for community events like the popular Hari Raya bazaar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng also asked for more parks and recreational areas. We will do just that. Woodlands Waterfront will be completed later this year.&nbsp;Punggol Promenade and the Labrador Nature and Coastal Walk will be completed within the next two years.&nbsp;When the Labrador Nature and Coastal Walk is ready, we can link that up with the Southern Ridges Walk where we cross from the Southern Ridges, go down Alexandra Road, walk along this Labrador Nature&nbsp;Walk and eventually reach Vivo City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our vision of Singapore as a city in the garden is also taking shape fast. The 54-hectare Gardens by the Bay at Marina South will offer Singaporeans a new experience of urban greenery. Two cooled conservatories will showcase plants and flowers from the tropical Montane and Mediterranean regions.&nbsp;Super trees that are nine to 16 storeys tall will feature vertical gardens with large foliage and tropical blooms on them.&nbsp;Concerts and shows would be held in the Garden City setting for Singaporeans to enjoy.&nbsp;The construction of&nbsp;the Gardens by the Bay is on track.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is expected to open by the end of 2011.&nbsp;Key infrastructures such as the drainage, lake system, the land forms, the road works, have been completed.&nbsp;Tree planting has started.&nbsp; In fact, tree nursery has also been established and the two conservatories are being constructed right now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the Gardens by the Bay, residents can also look forward to new and rejuvenated regional parks over the next two years, these include new parks in Punggol, Bishan, Sembawang and Yishun.&nbsp; Our parks will be more accessible as we expand the Park Connector network.&nbsp; This is the Park Connector network that I think many Members have used either for cycling, jogging, roller-blading, etc.&nbsp;And this year we will launch the Northern Explorer Park Connector loop which will serve residents living in Marsiling, Woodlands, Sembawang and Yishun.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, allow me to end my remarks with a short video clip to share with Members what a wonderful home we have and what we look forward to in the next few years &ndash; a beautiful home in a garden.&nbsp;[<I>Video clip shown to hon.

Foreigners make up nearly 90% of the workforce in the industry. The levy increase is individually minimal but collectively will have direct impact on construction costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In tandem with the proposed increases, Government programmes and schemes must also be introduced over the three years to raise skills, productivity levels to attract Singaporeans to re-enter the construction sector.&nbsp; If the employers react by reducing the workforce as a knee-jerk reaction, then&nbsp;our goal&nbsp;to re-skill Singaporeans will not be achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the Ministry of National Development share its strategies to address these issues?&nbsp; How does the Ministry of National Development intend to assist local contractors to increase and sustain productivity?

We will also explore new classes of CoreTrade personnel, such as construction supervisors, which can cater more for locals.&nbsp;BCA is enhancing its outreach to students who form the potential pipeline of new local construction personnel in higher value trades or in supervisory positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, at the firm level, we will help finance firms' efforts to adopt the technology, to innovate and to re-engineer their construction processes.&nbsp;For smaller firms which specialise in more labour intensive trades, we will provide support for the purchase and leasing of equipment.&nbsp; We recognise that the cost of technology adoption can be an impediment to firms which want to switch to a greater use of machines and technology.&nbsp; For example, a trained worker using spray machines for painting can reduce the time needed to complete a paint job by at least 20% compared to the use of rollers and brushes.&nbsp;The <I>Straits Times</I> wrote a very interesting article about how a company can, through the use of equipment such as a spray machine, reduce the number of workers and manage to get much better and higher value added jobs for the company.&nbsp;These are the examples that we&nbsp;hope to encourage.&nbsp;But we recognise that the spray machines can cost about $6,000-$10,000.&nbsp; So, with the Government helping to co-fund such equipment, we hope to help small builders switch to a greater use of machinery to improve their productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For firms that are seeking to upgrade their productivity levels, we will provide funding support for the adoption of technology and re-engineering of workflow.&nbsp; For example, the use of precast facade with coloured finishes done in a factory is more productive than the conventional way of constructing walls, followed by plastering and painting works. Such works on-site and the use of scaffoldings can be eliminated.&nbsp;There is scope for the main builder, the precast suppliers and installers to collaborate, and to seek Government's support to improve their workflow. In addition to financing part of their equipment cost, firms can also use the funds to cover the training cost of workers to operate the equipment, as well as the engagement of specialist consultants to enhance productivity level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, for the industry.&nbsp;For the industry as a whole, we will provide financing to help build capabilities through the use of new construction methods, and improve productivity among different firms across the value chain.&nbsp; For instance, firms can adopt the 3D Building Information Modelling (BIM), which is an IT solution that enhances collaboration and streamline the sharing of information across the construction value chain &ndash; from the architects to the engineers and the builders.&nbsp;BCA will collaborate with industry partners to test-bed and adapt new construction technology to our local context for industry-wide adoption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further upstream, developers and architects will have to design for greater buildability.&nbsp;Since 2001, BCA's Buildability Score Framework has improved the efficiency in designs, requiring the wider use of prefabrication and precast technology.&nbsp;As Er Lee Bee Wah has pointed out, the use of buildable structural systems has doubled from 31% before 2001 to 65% today, and the use of prefabricated wall components has increased from 22% to 45%.&nbsp;We have done a lot but I think we can do more, and we will do more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo asked about our efforts to raise buildability.&nbsp; BCA will require more buildable designs, including the regulation of more labour efficient construction technologies.&nbsp; The industry can seek Government funding to build capability in areas such as prefabrication, precast technology and other construction technology to meet the new buildability requirements.&nbsp; For example, builders can utilise integrated system formwork which has proven to be labour efficient and is widely used in countries like Germany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Heng&nbsp;Chee How asked how we would be partnering with the industry in&nbsp;this productivity drive.&nbsp;BCA will set up the construction productivity centre to champion innovative solutions and technologies in the construction sector. We recognise thatthe challenges faced by small firms can be quite different&nbsp;from the larger ones.&nbsp; I have asked BCA to set up dedicated teams to look into the specific needs of firms of different sizes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Er Lee Bee Wah has enquired about the measures to improve the capability of the industry.&nbsp; BCA will work with progressive builders to build new capabilities in complex civil engineering and building works.&nbsp;With the strong pipeline of projects in underground expressways and rail projects, firms can tap on the fund to build up their in-house technical competency for such complex projects.&nbsp;Funds can be used to defray the procurement costs of performance bonds to facilitate cash flow as well as to engage external specialists.&nbsp;We will also introduce a new post-graduate scholarship programme and an immersion programme to develop engineering expertise to undertake these complex projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa has asked how the levy increases will impact the industry and whether we would see further construction bottlenecks as a result of the economic recovery and market buoyancy. In general, we estimate that the higher levies could result in 1%-2% rise in construction cost for the industry,&nbsp;although the actual cost impact will vary from firm to firm.&nbsp; The $250 million fund will support the construction firms, be they large or small, to adopt a wide spectrum of productivity improvement measures that I have just alluded to.&nbsp; In 2008, we saw a peak construction demand of $36 billion, which dropped to $21 billion in 2009 as a result of the economic recession.&nbsp; With a projected construction demand of between $18 billion and $27 billion for the next three years, there is an urgent need to improve productivity so that our construction capacity can raise its output without having to increase its workforce significantly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo has asked how HDB estates can be more sustainable as well as our sustainable building plan.&nbsp; Our existing HDB estates have designs which facilitate cross ventilation and natural lighting.&nbsp; For new estates, we will continue to incorporate environmentally friendly features and green technologies.&nbsp; For example, HDB is pushing forward the installation of solar photovoltaic panels&nbsp;at four precincts at Tampines, Bukit Panjang, Tanjong Pagar and Marine Parade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB, together with Town Councils, also aims to reduce the energy consumption of common areas in new and existing HDB estates by 20% and 30% respectively.&nbsp; This is done by introducing features such as energy efficient light fittings and lift systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, HDB has piloted centralised recycling chute systems in our existing estates.&nbsp; This is in Blocks 297C and 297D Chua Chu Kang.&nbsp; The results of the pilot study were encouraging, with about&nbsp;three times more recyclables collected as compared to conventional door-to-door collection method.&nbsp; With the plan to position Punggol as an Eco-Town for the tropics, such technologies will be explored for testing on a larger scale in Punggol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our sustainable development efforts must extend beyond our public housing estates.&nbsp; In April 2009, the Government released Sustainable Singapore Blueprint which outlined our efforts to improve our overall energy efficiency by 35% from the reference point of 2005 levels by 2030.&nbsp; All sectors, including the building sector, will need to play their part towards meeting this target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of this year, we will raise the mandatory minimum energy efficiency standard for Green Mark certified level for new buildings by 10% from today&rsquo;s standard.&nbsp; Correspondingly, the energy efficiency standards for other Green Mark levels, ie, Gold, GoldPlus, and Platinum, will similarly be raised.&nbsp; Building owners can enjoy cost savings in the long run by being more energy efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To better understand energy consumption patterns, and to monitor the effectiveness of our energy efficiency measures, BCA will require building owners and utilities companies to submit energy and other building related data, such as Gross Floor Area (GFA) and specifications of building systems, on an annual basis starting from 2011.&nbsp;Building owners can also use the information to proactively improve their buildings&rsquo;

Facilities that encourage barrier-free accessibility in public infrastructure and housing are becoming more commonplace, but I feel that we can do more for those living in the private estates, eg, Yio Chu Kang Gardens which is in my ward.&nbsp; This private estate was built on elevated ground.&nbsp; Hence, the need for residents to climb 28 steps to get down to the bus stop along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 and the wet market at Block 628.&nbsp; It is a challenge for the senior citizens and residents on wheelchairs as well as parents with babies in prams and residents who use trolleys for their daily marketing at the wet market.&nbsp; As a result, some even turn to driving their cars even for what would have been walking distance errands.&nbsp; This is not only wasteful and an environmentally unfriendly act, but it has become a necessity by default under the circumstances.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further underscore the need for&nbsp;barrier-free access (BFA)&nbsp;in one of the most severe accidents, an elderly pedestrian lost her balance and fell while climbing the steps and suffered a few broken bones.&nbsp;I hope BFA facilities can be implemented sooner than later before worse accidents happen.&nbsp; The CIPC funding given to private estates is not sufficient to construct this BFA, even if I use the funding for all my private estates just for this BFA.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to extend barrier-free access to the private estates in Singapore, just like what&nbsp;we have done for all HDB residents.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

So, in the case of the 2006 planning exercise, we used the population figure of 6.5 million people for year \"X\"&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;50 years hence&nbsp;&ndash; which in that case would have been 2056.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The impression is that it is very hard work and&nbsp;not paying well.&nbsp;And I think that work needs to be done on this issue of image for the construction industry&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the pay and the professionalism of the workers who are in the construction industry.&nbsp;Are there efforts that the Ministry is thinking about to really improve this image over time?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I think what we want to do,&nbsp;first and foremost,&nbsp;is to make sure that in the work environment,&nbsp;sufficient attention is paid to safety as well as to have proper equipment and training, so that potential employees know that when they work in the construction industry, it is not hazardous, they are not putting their lives at risk.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I think it is also about raising the career prospects and this is where we have&nbsp;to put in a lot of attention to look at how we can build a career path for our Singaporean workers that if&nbsp;you enter the industry, there is a training roadmap for you and that with the better training and certification; at the end of it, there is a licensing scheme which&nbsp;you can be licensed as a tradesman, as well as a supervisor, and that ultimately will put you in&nbsp;a very good position for better paying jobs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, I think the industry is reaching a&nbsp;very exciting phase, because of concerns over environment as well as&nbsp;a new focus on green building technology.&nbsp; I think this is a very attractive area for young Singaporeans.&nbsp;They find that there is a mission, there is a calling,&nbsp;to improve the environment for Singaporeans as well as for the world as a whole.&nbsp; The ability to add value in making our buildings more efficient, in terms of energy and resources, or&nbsp;making our buildings more appealing, for example, in this whole area of urban design, has now attracted a lot of attention from our younger prospective employees.&nbsp;So, thank you for the question.&nbsp;We are going to continue with our effort to increase the profile of the industry.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Heng Chee How-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to ask her, aside from the efforts aimed at upgrading the skills and capability of the workforce within the sector, would efforts also&nbsp;be&nbsp;put in to retaining the skills&nbsp;and capabilities already acquired by the workforce, both local as well as foreign.&nbsp; And I say so because the construction sector by its nature goes through cycles, and we have seen cycles where they actually shed significant numbers of workers, local and especially foreign.&nbsp; And many of these workers would have picked up skills in the meantime, and it would not be easy to get them all back too quickly when the upturn comes.&nbsp; So as we go forward,&nbsp;would this&nbsp;be part of the plan to retain them?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien:</B> Mr Chairman, we are keen to build up a local core group of experienced as well as skilled workers in the industry.&nbsp;We have done so, not just through a training framework but also through the CoreTrade Scheme.&nbsp;We have made it mandatory for projects of certain size to have licensed tradesmen to do the job.&nbsp;By doing so, as I mentioned earlier, it is really our intention to make it more attractive to view construction as a career.&nbsp;And that is not just&nbsp;for locals alone, but also for foreign workers, because&nbsp;we must admit that this industry is not one that we can depend entirely on locals to fill the jobs that are available. So we need to now look at the group of foreign workers that are working in the industry.&nbsp;I think Mr Heng&nbsp;also earlier asked about the areas in the C21 that we have not adopted.&nbsp; I think one key area is the training of foreign workers.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, we had always viewed foreign workers in the construction industry as transient in nature and we had not put emphasis on training foreign workers.&nbsp;I think this will change with what we are doing now.&nbsp;We will look at improving the experience and skills of foreign workers as well. We are not saying that we are going to have all of them staying in Singapore for&nbsp;the long run, but we are looking at building a&nbsp;core group that perhaps will provide guidance as well as necessary supervision in the industry.&nbsp;And the changes that we are making in the foreign worker levy framework&nbsp;will help us&nbsp;reach this goal.&nbsp;We are, for example,&nbsp;having another tier of foreign worker levy that is a lower amount, targeting at foreign workers with experience and certification.&nbsp; So, if you have been here for four years and you have accumulated certain certifiable skills, you will qualify for a lower foreign worker levy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, these are the changes that we are making to basically steer the construction industry towards one that has greater skills content and of a higher productivity level.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Can I just ask whether the Government has plans to ensure that the roads, parks and other social amenities in that area would be sufficient to cope with the expected increase in the commercial activities in that area?&nbsp; On the same point, for the Amber and Katong area, what are URA's plans to prevent overcrowding which would add to the social pressure for the residents in that area?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

From the Concept Plan review that I talked about earlier, we actually derive a detailed and&nbsp;specific Master Plan.&nbsp;This Master Plan will then look in a more detailed manner, what kind of road infrastructure is needed, what kind of transport infrastructure is needed, what kind of other facilities such as schools,&nbsp;jobs,&nbsp;parks, shops, commercial areas, etc, are needed.&nbsp; This level of planning is conducted at the master planning level.&nbsp;I want to assure&nbsp;the Member that when we do make these changes, they will be&nbsp;taken as a whole and not just development for its own sake.&nbsp; I think this is one of the strengths of the Singapore planning system.&nbsp; When we plan, we plan it on a holistic level, taking everything into consideration.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member is worried, justifiably so, about the increased developments in the East Coast area, particularly in the Amber-Katong area.&nbsp; This has traditionally been a very low density area, but it has become much more high density as a result of the changes in the Master Plan.&nbsp; But the Master Plan does not just talk about re-zoning to higher density, it also takes into account and discusses with the relevant Government agencies, eg, LTA, what will these additional increased densities mean for traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, to answer his question about Amber and Katong, the transportation infrastructure has taken into account these new developments.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;still being planned, so it is not in place yet.&nbsp;For example, the MRT system in the East Coast area will reach that particular area.&nbsp;The Circle Line will serve part of the Paya Lebar developments.&nbsp; The roads will also be expanded.&nbsp;There will be a new Marina Coastal Expressway that will be built, in addition to the current East Coast Parkway, which will help to take additional traffic volumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in a nutshell, when such development plans take place, whether it is further expansion of Jurong or&nbsp;Paya Lebar, or whether it is intensification of land use in the Katong area, it is done on a total basis.&nbsp;Of course, there will be specific&nbsp;pockets of congestion that will take place, and this has to&nbsp;be resolved at a local level.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are such problems taking place, LTA and URA, will collectively look at these problems together with the MP for the area.&nbsp;I am aware that there are such localised congestion problems in that vicinity and I will be happy to look at those specific areas in greater detail.&nbsp; But,&nbsp;overall,&nbsp;the whole planning process takes into account a whole gamut of requirements, ranging from housing to roads to schools to nature areas, even right down to things like markets and places of worship, etc.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> I recall&nbsp;that there was an answer to a parliamentary question just a couple of days ago on this subject.&nbsp; Let me just reiterate the main points.&nbsp; First of all, yes, there is an increasing pressure on carpark spaces in HDB estates.&nbsp; This is as a result of the increase in the car population where planning norms used to indicate a certain number for HDB estates.&nbsp; We did not count on the fact that many families actually have more than one car today.&nbsp; Some have even three or more cars.&nbsp; As a result of that, we do face a pressure on carpark space.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, there are enough carparks but in localised areas you have a shortage.&nbsp; HDB tells us, when they did the last survey, that about 10% of the carparks in Singapore are over-subscribed; in other words, there is a need for expansion.&nbsp; So we will look at this 10% as a priority to see how we can alleviate that shortage.&nbsp; We can do that in several ways.&nbsp; One, we can simply expand the surface carpark if there is space and&nbsp;there are no other competing uses for land or, two,&nbsp;we could increase the number of floors on&nbsp;an existing MSCP (Multi-Storey Carpark).&nbsp; That is also possible.&nbsp; But if those two measures are not sufficient, then we will be looking at building MSCPs.&nbsp; These are the three ways we can alleviate that problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, the problem is that there is an increase in the car population in our HDB estates.&nbsp;The Ministry of Transport (MOT) is looking at the control of car population. On our part, we would have to provide sufficient carpark space.&nbsp;But I&nbsp;want to add that some of the problems cannot be solved just by MSCPs alone.&nbsp;Sometimes, when we look at the carparks, we group several carparks together into one.&nbsp;And&nbsp;when we look at the number, we find that actually there is sufficient carpark space.&nbsp; The problem is that there is insufficient carpark space in one particular carpark, even though there may be available lots elsewhere.&nbsp; Here, we will have to look at some demand management measures&nbsp;as well, eg, we may have to look into giving more priority to the first car of each family as opposed to the second or even the third car.&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the increase in the supply of carpark spaces, we will have to look at demand management measures as well.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Lee Bee Wah:</B> Sir, I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary how many private estates were selected for estate upgrading per year during the last few years and how many private estates are there in Singapore.&nbsp; At the rate that we go, I am afraid some of the residents may have to wait as long as 30 years before their estates are selected for the estate upgrading project.&nbsp; In view of the ageing population, I would like to urge the Ministry to set aside a sum&nbsp; for carrying out Barrier-Free Accessibility (BFA) for private estates.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</B> Sir, we understand Er Lee Bee Wah's concern for her residents and many other residents in the private estates.&nbsp; As Members are aware, we have two programmes for upgrading of private estates.&nbsp;The main programme is the Estate Upgrading Programme.&nbsp;For estate upgrading, the target is really for the&nbsp;older estates.&nbsp;We know that basically the criterion is the age&nbsp;of the estates&nbsp;because&nbsp;these are&nbsp;the estates&nbsp;that require a lot&nbsp;more upgrading works.&nbsp;At the same time, it is the magnitude of the work that could be done because we want to make sure that&nbsp;the funds put in&nbsp;are made available for the Estate Upgrading Programme, and&nbsp;to effectively&nbsp;try to do a lot more of the works that are required.&nbsp;Even in private estates, as we know, when works start, the&nbsp;disruption that is&nbsp;created would create&nbsp;a lot of inconvenience to the residents.&nbsp;When we do Estate Upgrading Programme, there is a lot of planning that goes into it.&nbsp; The funds that we put in are quite substantial.&nbsp;That is the reason why we do not have unlimited&nbsp;upgrading works&nbsp;as the resources are limited.&nbsp;We select a few estates at that point in time based on the assessment of the Estate Upgrading Programme&nbsp;Committee.&nbsp;We select those estates that are older which have got better opportunities for upgrading in terms of the works that can be done, and&nbsp;we work with all the different agencies to try and make the work as comprehensive as possible with limited disruption to the residents.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the other programme which was introduced last year was the Interim Estate Upgrading Programme that Members are aware of.&nbsp; This includes opportunities for the younger estates.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Er Lee said, it would take sometime for the older estates to be eligible for upgrading and sometimes the works within the estate may not be as extensive but may require immediate attention. So we do&nbsp;provide funding for Interim Estate Upgrading.&nbsp; Having said that, on the question of how long and when we are able to provide for&nbsp;upgrading of those estates, the approach of both I-EUP and EUP is to assess the local situation.&nbsp; Every estate is different and unique.&nbsp;I think the current programme that we have allows&nbsp; the residents as well as the committee to make decisions and prioritise. On&nbsp;the example that Er Lee highlighted, she is aware that it is a very extensive investment as we need to consider the&nbsp;width of the proposed ramp as well as the height&nbsp;that is required.

But that is really meant for the elderly&nbsp;&ndash; the senior citizens.&nbsp;That is the reason why we have a shorter lease.&nbsp;But I am not keen on the idea of a 60-year lease for a young family or young couple starting up.&nbsp;We want to make flats affordable for them.&nbsp;Let us find other ways of doing so.&nbsp;Give them more additional housing grant, build smaller flats for them and also tweak the policy such that higher income applicants do not compete with them for the same flats. So for the 3-room flats, we have a $3,000 household income ceiling, that means, if you earn more than $3,000, you will not be able to compete for the 3-room flat.&nbsp;Similarly,&nbsp;if you want to buy a 2-room flat, your income cannot be more than $2,000. With all these in place, we do not see any problem in making HDB flats affordable for first-time low-income families.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Last clarification, Dr Lim.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang):</B> Sir,&nbsp;the Minister mentioned that the current measures are enough to cool the property market and say that the Ministry will consider more measures.&nbsp;Can the Minister clarify what are the other measures that the Ministry is thinking of now if the market is not cooled by&nbsp;his&nbsp;cool tea?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> If we tell you what other measures there are, then there is no point in having these other measure in&nbsp;our pockets.&nbsp;\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Foo, last question.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> Sir, can&nbsp;I&nbsp;just ask a couple&nbsp;more short questions?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; We have only &nbsp;four minutes.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> The Minister was talking about how to make HDB flats affordable last Friday and also in reply to Mr Ang Mong Seng's question.&nbsp; I would like to ask if it is possible to make the DSR progressive for 3-room, 4-room, 5-room, etc.&nbsp; In other words, the DSR for a 3-roomer should be lower than a 4-roomer and 5-roomer.&nbsp; What is the Minister's view on that?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> I think that is a very relevant point because if we talk about&nbsp;Debt Service Ratio (DSR), obviously the amount of money that a&nbsp;low-income family needs as a proportion of his total household income for his other necessities would be higher than, say, for a higher-income family.&nbsp; So, strictly speaking, the ideal DSR&nbsp;for a low-income family for a 2-room flat should be smaller than the DSR for a higher-income family for a bigger flat.&nbsp;I do agree with the point that the Member is making.&nbsp;Indeed, the evidence suggests that this is so.&nbsp; Over the last 10 years or so, I have been looking at the numbers and the Debt Service Ratio for the smaller flats, ie,&nbsp;the 2-room flats, is indeed smaller than for the 3-room, 4-room and&nbsp;5-room flats. That is a result of a deliberate pricing policy that we have plus, of course, the additional grants that we give to the low-income families.&nbsp;Just to recap, for a low-income family of, say, $1,500, that family can&nbsp;get as much as another $40,000 more in grant.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> $80,000 in total?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> $80,000 in total.&nbsp; In other words, if they buy a resale flat, they have got $40,000 from the CPF grant, another $40,000 from the additional housing grant.&nbsp;If they buy a new 2-room flat, they can get, on top of the subsidised price, additional discount of $40,000.&nbsp;With these things in place, the Debt Service Ratio for that family buying a 2-room flat is below 20%.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Foo, are you withdrawing your amendment?</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> Sir, can I use up the entire four minutes?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Otherwise, the Ministry will not have any money to do&nbsp;projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true.&nbsp; So you have got to withdraw your amendment.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng:</B> Sir, one very quick question.

In 2009, roughly about 0.8% contraction happened globally and, this year, IMF forecasted 3.9% growth and next year 2011, IMF forecasted 4.3% growth.&nbsp;With two consecutive years of growth globally, we should expect a higher growth regionally in Asia. I expect Asia to be leading the charge and emerging economies to reap the maximum benefit. As such, this is very critical for us to identify potential opportunities.&nbsp;The emerging markets could grow three times faster or better than most of the world's advanced economies.&nbsp;And what is exactly in store&nbsp;in terms of opportunities for our local businesses, especially the SMEs?&nbsp; I am glad that this year, the Government is&nbsp;focusing on the SMEs and coming up with several measures, especially in the areas of innovation for the SMEs to tap on the various grants to help them to innovate and&nbsp;grow their businesses.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Government to provide some guidance as to what other areas of opportunities these SMEs can actually tap on, in order to grow their businesses and expand their horizon.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Growth opportunities</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Chairman, for many of our companies, the growth opportunities lie outside Singapore.

For example, one of my Indian friends once told me &ndash; in India, to get on the bus is not to stand in line at the bus stop.&nbsp; Either you get on the bus before the bus stops or run after it and jump on it after it has left the bus stop.&nbsp; Imagine how uncomfortable that will be for our people in our interchanges.&nbsp; You can also imagine&nbsp;the mental dexterity and swiftness in action of people who have grown up in such an environment.&nbsp; Some countries like China are already flushed with capital, such that some aspects of our earlier value proposition is no longer that attractive.&nbsp; In short, our window of opportunity is closing and we should try to leverage our strengths and make as much headway as possible.&nbsp; Many from the developed countries have their government pitching for them.&nbsp; I am very enthused by the recent pronouncements that give hope that our Government is pulling out all stops to assist businesses in their forays overseas.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, many times in the past, I feel that while the intention is there, we are constrained into paralysis by our elaborate considerations of all angles.&nbsp; I guess, if you think hard enough you can always find a&nbsp; problem.&nbsp; This brings me back to my suggestion in the budget debate that advocates for businesses be planted in Government agencies to pitch on behalf of businesses.&nbsp; If we depend on the same group of civil servants with the ingrained mindset, I fear that we may be disappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not further compound our lack of size.&nbsp; An all-Government approach is important.&nbsp; Let us pay heed to the several speakers at the Budget debate who still detect silos in our Government.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

What are the measures and support available to both local and foreign businesses?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, given the threats of climate change and pandemics, we spoke about the possibility of setting up Singapore as a disaster&nbsp;and relief co-ordination hub.&nbsp;Could the Minister&nbsp;give an update on this?&nbsp; Also, would the Minister agree that this hub is even more effective if we also invest in building a Humanitarian or International Organisational Hub that can complement the hard products with humanitarian software and services &ndash; whether in training or hot housing such organisations?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:&nbsp;</B> Mr Liang Eng Hwa, take both of your cuts together.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Growing globally competitive companies</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa:</B> Sir, the key buzzword for this year's Budget is productivity.&nbsp;Given the significant gap between our productivity levels and that of our global leaders, it&nbsp;is clearly something we need to work on.&nbsp;In several of our large sectors, we are about 60% of the global leaders.&nbsp;Even if we are able to achieve the 2%-3%&nbsp;productivity growth for a whole decade, it will at best only get us near the leaders and put us in the game.&nbsp;Our competitors who are behind us will catch up and narrow the productivity gap as well.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point here is that a competitive, skilled and productive workforce, while essential and necessary, is only a prerequisite and a tentative first step. It does not guarantee us long-term livelihood in the brave new world. At&nbsp;the end of the day, we need viable and successful businesses and companies in Singapore to create and sustain quality jobs for&nbsp;our workforce.&nbsp;Of course, without a first class workforce in Singapore, we will also not have a viable and successful business here.&nbsp;So, only with labour and capital working seamlessly together, can we multiply our economy value and grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given our small and&nbsp;export-dependent economy, we must get our local&nbsp;enterprises to be more outward looking and to have their&nbsp;business strategies&nbsp;geared towards the wider world. Many of these firms may be doing well locally but we&nbsp;need&nbsp;them to think big, expand the operation beyond our shores and develop our external economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as the ESC pointed out, we do not have a healthy spread of local companies of different sizes. We have a dire shortage of&nbsp;large firms, especially those that have annual sales turnover of beyond $100 million or above. There is a clear&nbsp;need to&nbsp;expand this $100 million club and spur some&nbsp;of its members to grow into industry champions in their own right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, I am glad that the ESC has recommended an ambitious target to double the number of local enterprises with revenue of over $100 million from 500 to 1,000 within the next 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are generous schemes announced in the Budget that would certainly help.&nbsp;Some examples include the $1.5 billion growth capital for co-investments in local companies, tax deductions for angel investors and Government assistance in cross-border financing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all&nbsp;great news for local companies seeking internationalisation.&nbsp;My only concern is whether there are now just too many&nbsp;measures being offered by the various economic agencies. This buffet spread of schemes may be getting too much for the companies and even for the staff of these agencies to digest. I read that&nbsp;between the various agencies, like IE Singapore, SPRING, EDB,&nbsp;Customs, and so on, there are&nbsp;about 157 schemes. I am sure the bright officers at these agencies would be able to come up with more schemes each time the businesses or the MPs present a strong and deserving case or request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, following ESC report,&nbsp;I believe it would&nbsp;also be timely&nbsp;to take stock of the various schemes across agencies and see how we could harmonise and further streamline the various programmes and also minimise the administrative paper work. The challenge is to make these schemes even simpler, yet retain their effectiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides assistance schemes to help&nbsp;companies grow, I am glad that the Budget also enhanced the future business leaders scheme. Without entrepreneurial skills, there would not&nbsp;be business and ventures. We need a new generation of self-starting businessmen to emerge, stand tall&nbsp;and be prepared to take risk on their capital. Hence, I would like to ask the Minister&nbsp;if an entrepreneur culture has indeed taken root in Singapore, something we had debated at length in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides growing companies to beyond the $100 million sales revenue, we should&nbsp;push for&nbsp;the growth of&nbsp;new industry champions and develop our&nbsp;local brand names, global in outlook, yet&nbsp;anchored to the local economy. Having a strong base of such companies gives us a bigger handle of our own economic destiny and hence greater economic resilience. These companies will employ our skilled and productive local workforce, utilise our infrastructures and real estate, pay returns to our capital and, most importantly, call Singapore their home. We need more of these queen bees, as I have said in my Budget speech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could leverage on our strengths and advantages. We have the capital, the talents,&nbsp;the infrastructures and system know-how for new industry champions to emerge. So let us aim to nurture and develop between three and five global brands, similar to the likes of SIA in the next 10 to 15 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Business cost</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the economy is recovering with little spare capacity.&nbsp; Unemployment remains at a very low level of about 2% and bottlenecks remain in many parts of the economy.&nbsp; Externally, commodity prices are on the uptrend again and oil prices today are above $80 per barrel.&nbsp; Coupled with the impending increase in foreign worker levy which will have a spiral effect on the economy, there is a real risk that business cost will rise sharply again in the next one to two years.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>2.00 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The investments in productivity growth, which would take some time to bear fruits, would not help improve the situation in the short term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, I hope that the Government will keep tab of the costs of doing business and our cost competitiveness even as the economy recovers.

We went through&nbsp;a deep recession in the first half, but rebounded strongly towards the end of the year. GDP contracted by 2% over the year but employment increased by 38,800 jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2010, our focus will be on recovery and setting the stage for the next phase of growth.&nbsp; I will briefly talk about the outlook for 2010 and our strategy for consolidating the on-going recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the medium term, we have to count on productivity to fuel our growth.&nbsp;As Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said, productivity also means increasing the top line.&nbsp;I will therefore spend sometime discussing the economic opportunities and growth strategies for the medium term.&nbsp;In other words, how to grow the \"top line\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore economy should do well in the first half of this year.&nbsp; But uncertainties remain in the second half.&nbsp;We expect the fiscal stimulus in the G3 economies will fade and inventory adjustment will taper off in the second half.&nbsp; The underlying sluggish demand in private consumption and investment in the G3 economies, combined with fragile financial markets and tight credit conditions, may slow the pace of recovery.&nbsp; There are also new downside risks for us to monitor, such as the sovereign debt risk in Europe and asset inflation risks in Asia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, overall, our economy should grow by between 4.5% and 6.5% this year. This is slower than previous recoveries, but&nbsp;a decent performance nonetheless given the strains the global economy is undergoing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Liang Eng Hwa have asked how we intend to manage our recovery and whether business costs will start to go up again as assistance measures are withdrawn and demand picks up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the economy recovers, we must expect costs to go up compared to last year when we were in a recession. But there is still some slack in our economy. As of the fourth quarter 2009, the economy was around 4%, below its recent peak level of output.&nbsp;Office rents and industrial rents were 17% and 29% below their peaks respectively.&nbsp; Nominal wages last year were 2.6% below 2008 levels.&nbsp; So we do have some buffer.&nbsp; Our forecast for inflation this year is between 2%&nbsp;and 3%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy Mohamad asked for an update of the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative (SRI) scheme.&nbsp; In the 14 months, from December 2008 to January 2010, more than 16,000 loans worth about $8.9 billion have been catalysed under the SRI and other enhanced business and trade financing schemes.&nbsp; More than 90% of these loans went to our SMEs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have extended these schemes for another year, with some scaling back on lending terms in view of the improving credit conditions.&nbsp; We expect the impact of this revision to be minimal as there had already been a decrease in the demand for Government-backed loans prior to this scaling back.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the discontinuation of the SRI in 2011, SMEs will still be able to tap on the mainstay Government financing schemes, which were in place before the recession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the economic opportunities and the growth strategies for Singapore.&nbsp; Ms Jessica Tan, Mr Teo Ser Luck, Mr Wee Siew Kim and Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim have all raised pertinent questions on this subject. The Economic Strategies Committee has set out the broad directions for the economy for the next 10 years, and the Government has responded with a slew of measures and programmes in our Budget.&nbsp; Let me focus on the five key growth strategies that my Ministry will pursue in order to raise the top line over the medium term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will facilitate existing industries to move up the value chain by helping them to deepen and expand their capabilities.&nbsp; Second, we will take advantage of global trends, such as new growth areas at the intersection of the manufacturing and service sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will build a more diverse and vibrant corporate landscape.&nbsp; Last year, I explained that the value-added of our economy is contributed by the four groups: foreign MNCs contributing one-quarter of our value-add; foreign SMEs, another one-quarter; local large companies, one-quarter; and local SMEs, one-quarter.&nbsp;Going forward, we want to strengthen our corporate landscape by adding new players, for example, global mid-sized companies and Asian MNCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fourth strategy, we will strengthen our integration with our ASEAN neighbours to sharpen our competitive age.&nbsp;&nbsp;And fifth, we will support the internationalisation of our companies by leveraging on our existing Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) as well as pursuing new FTAs.&nbsp;Let me elaborate on each of these strategies in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has adopted a cluster approach in our industrial development strategy by promoting the growth of the wider ecosystem that supports each industry.&nbsp; Miss Penny Low asked how some of these cluster strategies were progressing, particularly, our hub strategies for each of these clusters.&nbsp; Overall, we have done reasonably well.&nbsp; Let me give a quick update on a few major clusters and how we are deepening and expanding their capabilities, which is our first strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start with the biomedical sciences (BMS).&nbsp;We started developing the BMS sector in 2000. Today, we&nbsp;are a highly competitive and trusted site for manufacturing pharmaceuticals.&nbsp; Our recent investment in building capabilities for biologics manufacturing has paid off. Despite the difficult conditions in 2009, we attracted new BMS projects resulting in 1,200 new jobs and over $1 billion in fixed investments. For example, GlaxoSmithKline opened a plant that will produce compounds used to manufacture its innovative vaccines such as a new vaccine that protects against meningitis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The logistics sector is also another key sector.&nbsp; Over the years, we have built upon our natural attributes and strengthen our position.&nbsp; Singapore was ranked by the World Bank in 2009 as the number two logistics hub in the world.&nbsp; Today, 17 of the world's top 25 leading logistics companies have a significant presence in Singapore.&nbsp; DHL, the world's largest logistics player, has expanded the responsibility of the Singapore office to manage operations as far away as the Middle East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low has asked whether we can become a humanitarian or an international organisation hub. We are making good progress. We are home to more than 80 international non-profit organisations, a number that has more than doubled since 2005.&nbsp; EDB has, in fact, set up a dedicated International Organisations Programme Office to assist international organisations interested in Singapore.&nbsp; We agree with Miss Penny Low that our strategic location in Asia and our excellent logistics connectivity lend ourselves naturally to play the role of a disaster rescue and relief coordination hub. This is, in fact, what is happening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me turn to the electronics sector.&nbsp;This sector has been with us since the 1960s. It is a good example of how we have moved up the value chain.&nbsp; We started with semiconductor packaging, then moved up to the hard disk drive assembly in the 1980s, and then semiconductor wafer fabrication.&nbsp; Today, nearly half of the world's hard disk media are made in Singapore. Electronics is a key demand driver for our logistics, chemicals and precision engineering industries.&nbsp;It is also an important capability enabler for new clusters such as avionics and medical technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But electronics is a sector that changes rapidly. So, we must also continuously adapt, and change in order to seize the opportunities in this very exciting sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the future of electronics, we have identified four new growth areas. First, concerns about climate change have raised awareness and need for green electronics products, such as energy-efficient computing solutions, green automative and green lighting solutions.&nbsp;Second, demand for bioelectronics products, such as&nbsp;ingestible pill-cameras and bio-sensors, will increase as&nbsp;the developed world ages. The final two areas are security technologies such as biometric access systems and plastic electronics such as flexible e-book displays.&nbsp;These four areas are very high-tech and build upon the competencies that we have already established.&nbsp;They illustrate that our electronic sector has the potential to continue to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, time does not permit me to go into all our sectors but suffice to say we have similar strategies to deepen and broaden our capabilities in each of our key sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me turn to our second growth strategy, which is riding on the convergence of manufacturing and services in new growth areas.&nbsp; The key to this strategy lies in understanding that the line between manufacturing and services is blurring.&nbsp; Some commentators have questioned why Singapore is still holding on to its manufacturing base. They are missing the point.&nbsp; It is not a choice between manufacturing or services, but whether we can successfully seize the new opportunities emerging in the space that spans manufacturing and services.&nbsp;Many manufacturing firms no longer simply transform raw materials into finished products. Rather, they now see themselves as entities that turn ideas into products and services that provide integrated solutions for the end-consumer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me illustrate with an example.&nbsp;Teo&nbsp;Garments is one of our largest local textile and garment manufacturing SMEs.&nbsp; They started off manufacturing apparel to meet the specifications of their customers. Today, they complement their manufacturing activities with a full range of services, from product development and design, to merchandising, to logistics management.&nbsp; Their customers, who include well-known Western brands such as Osh Kosh B'Gosh, benefit because it conveniently develops both the products and the services that they require. And, of course, Teo Garments benefits through the additional revenue and market opportunities that they can now reap.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Economists call this the \"servitisation of manufacturing\". We expect this development to gain momentum and see this being replicated in many other sectors, blurring the once clear distinction between manufacturing and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leading manufacturers are, therefore, moving beyond production to develop a full suite of services such as R&amp;D, design, supply-chain management and after-sales support.&nbsp; These are activities that Singapore is well placed to capture.&nbsp;We already have well developed professional and business services that complement our manufacturing activities but to capitalise on these new opportunities, we need our manufacturing base. By being a home to companies' entire suite of solutions, we entrench them further in Singapore.&nbsp;We are, therefore, not just deepening our capabilities in each cluster or sector but also capturing the value between the sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miss Penny Low and Ms Jessica Tan asked for the prospects of our global business hub strategy.&nbsp; Our third strategy is to build on this business hub position by attracting new players, as I mentioned just now.&nbsp; We intend to attract global mid-sized companies as well as Asian companies looking to internationalise and facilitating the growth of our own globally competitive companies.&nbsp; Mid-sized companies from the G3 economies who wish to tap into the opportunities in a rising Asia want to base their regional operations in a modern business friendly environment that is able to manage both India and China from one location.&nbsp; This is because some of these mid-sized companies do not want to set up one base in China, one base in India and another one in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;Singapore is well-positioned to be their pan-Asia headquarters.&nbsp;We have already done relatively well in attracting MNCs from the G3 economies to invest in Singapore. We are now attracting mid-sized companies who are responding to the Asian growth story and may grow into the MNCs of tomorrow.&nbsp;For example, Pall Corporation is an American clean-tech company specialising in fluid management technologies.&nbsp; They are keen to expand into Asia and have chosen to set up their Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore. &nbsp;At the same time, companies from India and China have started expanding their presence overseas.&nbsp;Singapore's excellent connectivity to G3 companies and markets offers them the option to take a small calibrated step out of their borders but which immediately connects them to the developed world.&nbsp;We&nbsp;have already had some initial success.&nbsp; For example, Tata Communications from India has set up an international headquarters and data centre here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our locally-based companies have grown quickly in the past decades.&nbsp; Some of them have managed to achieve regional and even international success.&nbsp; As Mr Liang Eng Hwa pointed out, our economy benefits when some of our local companies become industry champions in their own right and become queen bees.&nbsp;We definitely like to see more home-grown industry champions. We will take a multi-pronged approach to achieve this.&nbsp; Schemes such as the Partnerships for Capability Transformation&nbsp;(PACT) have already been announced by MOF and we will announce the details in May.&nbsp;We have many other schemes in place.&nbsp;Mr Liang counted there are over 150 schemes to help our local companies grow and succeed.&nbsp; I will leave it to Minister of State&nbsp;Lee Yi Shyan to elaborate on these schemes in his response later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is the idea that we have to ride on the Asia growth story. We think we can strive to be a leading consumer business centre in Asia where consumer insights are developed and consumer-centric businesses managed and grown.&nbsp;In this way, we can build up a cluster of companies in the consumer-related fields of marketing, branding, consumer research and market intelligence. We will, therefore, establish an Institute of Asia Consumer Insights in Singapore to conduct such research and analytics that will draw insights from consumer data to create value for companies that are established here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, our fourth growth strategy is to strengthen our integration with our Asian neighbours and, thereby, sharpen our competitive edge.&nbsp;ASEAN provides two key advantages for our businesses.&nbsp; First, with a middle-class of more than 75 million people, the ASEAN nations provide a growing market that serves as a very natural first step out of our borders.&nbsp; In fact, many of our successful companies such as Raoul, Crystal Jade and AceCom first started serving the ASEAN market before they expanded more widely onto the global stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, our companies have also leveraged on ASEAN as a competitive production base, conducting entire value chains of activities within ASEAN.&nbsp;For instance, STMicroelectronics conducts R&amp;D, IC design, application support and wafer fabrication in Singapore while the packaging of chips is carried out in Malaysia and the final testing of the chips is conducted in Malaysia or Philippines or in fact outsourced to other players in Southeast Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASEAN aims to achieve deeper economic integration through the ASEAN Economic Community or the AEC by 2015.&nbsp; The ACE will accelerate ASEAN's journey towards a single market and a synergistic&nbsp;production base with enhanced transport and business connectivity.&nbsp; ASEAN-based businesses, including Singapore-based businesses, will then be able to produce, operate and export more seamlessly across the region.&nbsp;We must take full advantage of this new development occurring in our neighbourhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our fifth growth strategy is to support our companies as they internationalise by leveraging on our existing FTAs and by pursuing new FTAs.&nbsp; Mr Wee Siew Kim asked about the benefits from our existing FTAs.&nbsp; Our FTAs have helped us to reduce costs, to lower our risks and open new markets for our companies.&nbsp; Let me elaborate. Today, Singapore has a network of 18 FTAs in force. &nbsp;As an export-oriented economy, Singapore thrives on the free flow of trade and better linkages to major economies and new markets.&nbsp; Last year, companies based in Singapore enjoy more than $700 million in tariff savings as a result of our FTAs.&nbsp; Our service suppliers and investors in key sectors enjoy more predictable and better access to the markets of our FTA partners.&nbsp; Furthermore, overseas investments by our companies have enjoyed increased protection, both through our FTAs and our investment guarantee agreements. Trade facilitation measures under our FTAs help to lower the business costs of our companies.&nbsp; For example, mutual recognition agreements eliminate duplicate testing and certification, yielding cost and time savings.&nbsp; In the case of consumer electronics, such mutual recognition agreements saved our exporters between $3,000&nbsp;to $8,000 on testing costs for&nbsp;each type of product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Wee Siew Kim has also asked about the areas where additional effort is needed.&nbsp; We already have FTAs with nearly all our top trading partners covering 66% of our exports.&nbsp; This year, we have embarked on two deeply significant FTAs.&nbsp; The first is with the European Union, our largest trading partner in 2009.&nbsp; We look forward to substantial tariff savings and improved market access there.&nbsp; The second is the Trans-Pacific Partnership FTA, together with seven other APEC economies, including the United States.&nbsp; This FTA can be the building block for eventually achieving an FTA for the Asia-Pacific region.&nbsp; The closer economic cooperation agreement with Egypt is also another important FTA this year.&nbsp; This would give us access to the Egyptian market.&nbsp; When done, this will be our first FTA with an African country&nbsp;which gives us access to both north and east Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, let me conclude. We are small and open and will always be vulnerable to the fluctuations of the global economy.&nbsp;There are still some uncertainties in the near future but we must chart the course for long-term growth and resilience during this period of our recovery.&nbsp; The first three strategies that I outlined&nbsp;&ndash; strengthening our existing clusters &ndash; capturing new growth areas and building a more vibrant corporate landscape &ndash; will expand the scope and capabilities of our companies as they compete in the new landscape.&nbsp;Our fourth and fifth strategies of deepening integration with our ASEAN neighbours and leveraging on our trade agreements will expand the market space for our companies.&nbsp;Together, these five strategies will put us on a path of a broad-based growth for our economy and create better jobs for all Singaporeans.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa:</B> Sir, one of the recommendations of ESC that caught the public's attention was the possibility of nuclear energy being a possible option to meet our long-term electricity needs.&nbsp; We know that nuclear energy has been around for some time and has been a strategic source of energy for many countries for many years. Technically, it is a rich source of energy at competitive economic cost.&nbsp; However, like many Singaporeans, it comes as a surprise to me that the&nbsp;nuclear energy would ever be a possible option in an island state with a size of about 710 square kilometers and a residing dense population of five million people. It may take a while for some to overcome that psychological barrier,&nbsp;given the perception of the radioactive hazards and safety concerns.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are strong strategic and economic appeals for the nuclear option. It would certainly enhance our energy resilience and, unlike many countries, we have the patient capital for such high capital intensive investments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the decision we made on the casinos some years ago, we know the compelling economic benefits but the question is whether the other costs can be mitigated and reduced to an acceptable level.&nbsp; Not much has been said by the Government or MTI since&nbsp;the release of this&nbsp;far-reaching recommendation by ESC. So,&nbsp;I hope that the Minister can shed more light on the Government's thinking and its position; pending, of course,&nbsp;the feasibility study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A decision like the adoption nuclear energy would have a significant&nbsp;bearing on future generations. I also hope that with more information from the Government, it would trigger a healthy and informed public debate on this issue much like what had happened to the IR debate.&nbsp; It would also be a good gauge of the risk profile of Singaporeans on the susceptibility of the nuclear risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our neighbouring countries are also looking at the nuclear energy option. Given the close proximity, can the Minister give an update on the developments at our neighbouring countries and how it could impact us?&nbsp; Do we have an ASEAN stand on nuclear energy, for example?&nbsp; I would also&nbsp;like to ask the Minister on the progress and developments of the other alternatives.&nbsp;How would nuclear energy feature when compare to these other alternatives like solar, wind, and so on.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Can the Ministry come up with a listing of appropriate companies, contractors and gadgets in the market for easier consumer identification and choice?&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with a small list, I feel this can be expanded and also publicised.&nbsp;&nbsp;Other plans to work or collaborate with other agencies to encourage the use of solar, which I feel is certainly less controversial than that of nuclear energy.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As electricity is a modern necessity, it is of paramount importance that it is reliable, pollution-free and affordable.&nbsp; As regards reliability, the ESC recommended that, in the medium term, Singapore considers importing coal and electricity to diversify our energy sources so as to free up land in Singapore.&nbsp; I would like clarification on the pros and cons of relying on imports and, thus, becoming less self-reliant for our energy needs.&nbsp; Which are the countries we are likely to import electricity from?&nbsp; Will there be additional risks to our energy security?&nbsp; What are the infrastructure investments we need to put in place to enable this?&nbsp; Will these investments lead to higher electricity prices?&nbsp; Are we expecting imported electricity to be more or less expensive than what is generated in Singapore?&nbsp; As regards to coal, are we taking a step backwards on the environment when other countries are moving away from it due to such concerns?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for pricing, the ESC notes that economic fundamentals will mean that electricity prices will trend upwards, it further recommends pricing energy to reflect real cost and constraints, with suggestions of a carbon pricing scheme.&nbsp; From the point of view of the consumers, such a scheme sounds ominous, even with the offsets to help buffer the transition for the low-income.&nbsp; Sir, while offsets to low-income households will be useful while they last, an additional idea is to have a tiered system of pricing electricity in favour of small consumers.&nbsp; The fundamental idea is for the threshold level of power consumption by households to be determined.&nbsp; Households consuming less than the threshold level will enjoy a lower tariff charge.&nbsp; With increasing consumption levels, the tariff will escalate.&nbsp; The higher tariff collected in the upper tiers can be used for two purposes&nbsp;&ndash; one to cross subsidise the first tier tariff and, second, to encourage all households not to over-consumer electricity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many&nbsp;countries, including New Zealand, Canada, Hong Kong and the US, implement variations of this idea to protect small consumers.&nbsp; Some governments require electricity retailers, by law, to provide a low-tariff charge for small consumers.&nbsp; I hope that MTI's plan to open up the market for electricity supply among households to several retailers can incorporate such a requirement for the retailers to provide a low-tariff charge for small&nbsp;consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Research and development</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, since the year 2000, Singapore has spent about $33 billion on R&amp;D, also referred as gross domestic expenditure on research and development&nbsp;(GERD).&nbsp; Of this, about $12 billion&nbsp;was funded by taxpayers.&nbsp; I agree that it is necessary for Singapore to invest&nbsp;heavily in R&amp;D for our nation's future, however, it is critically important to measure the output and impact of our R&amp;D investments to ensure&nbsp;it is money well spent.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, admittedly, not an easy task.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;results&nbsp;from research may take years to materialise and some R&amp;D may be undertaken for strategic reasons, the benefits&nbsp;of which may not be easy to quantify.&nbsp; Nevertheless, any spending from the public needs to be accounted for.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, how are we currently&nbsp;measuring the output and impact of our R&amp;D investments?&nbsp; I note that A*STAR puts out annual R&amp;D surveys, covering input factors such as GERD in various fields of R&amp;D and overall GERD&nbsp;as a percentage of GDP.&nbsp; There is also mention of certain outputs like sales revenue from commercialised products and processes, licensing revenues from patents and technologies produced here and the number of patent applications.&nbsp; However, the Singapore competitiveness report 2009 by&nbsp;the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy&nbsp;observed that&nbsp;Government funded research institutes did not seem to be translating&nbsp;the scientific research into new products and services at a significant skill.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does MTI agree with the author's allusion&nbsp;to some under-performance?&nbsp; What other output and outcome indicators are tracked by the Government?&nbsp;How are we doing in terms of R&amp;D output and outcomes <I>vis-a-vis</I> other countries at a&nbsp;comparable stage of&nbsp;R&amp;D?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, next &ndash; R&amp;D manpower. The number of full-time post-graduate research students, who are citizens or PRs, was only 26% in 2008 with 75% being non-PRs foreign citizens.&nbsp; The ESC has acknowledged that we need to boost the numbers of local students pursuing PhDs in R&amp;D fields.&nbsp; What are the Government's plans in relation to boosting the numbers of local students pursuing PhDs in R&amp;D?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Supporting local enterprises</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Sir, I would like to speak about how we can better support local enterprises and elaborate on what I mentioned during the Budget debate.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE), submitted several recommendations to the ESC. &nbsp;Firstly, ACE feels that there needs to be a clearer focus from the Government on local enterprise development.&nbsp;Currently, since resources are accorded by the Government to enterprises based on incremental economic activities &ndash;&nbsp;which is&nbsp;a value-added method that we have been using&nbsp;right now to evaluate the potential of companies &ndash;&nbsp;this disadvantages SMEs compared to foreign&nbsp;SMEs as the former build from a higher baseline. Singapore should support enterprises based on absolute total return rather than incremental economic activities to create a more level playing field for all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To aid in this objective, ACE proposed the establishment of a new local enterprise development agency or \"Enterprise Singapore\", which will be a single agency to develop globally competitive locally-based enterprises.&nbsp; Whilst the intent of SPRING and IE Singapore is to have specialised expertise to assist and support companies, this has also resulted in gaps to provide a seamless, comprehensive and integrated assistance to companies.&nbsp; Potential SMEs which could become Globally Competitive Companies (GCCs) but have reached a certain size, may not also be able to get the support from either agencies and, therefore, they are&nbsp;not well served under the current system.&nbsp; Other agencies with domain expertise like A*STAR, IDA, MDA and other agencies within the&nbsp;Government may not have a clear enterprise development role, nor are their KPIs directed in this focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Enterprise Singapore\" can, therefore, adopt&nbsp;a more targeted and \"account management\" approach than the other agencies in growing GCCs and involving the Whole-of-Singapore approach to provide the entire value-chain support to grow them from start-up to become world-class brands. &nbsp;An additional role of \"Enterprise Singapore\" could be to help in attracting, anchoring and nurturing promising world-class foreign start-ups and SMEs to locate in Singapore as EDB has successfully done for large MNCs in the past. These SMEs could one day become our GCCs and it does not matter where they originated from as long as they finally have home bases here&nbsp;in Singapore.&nbsp; I am glad that the Minister mentioned this is one of the strategies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore has seen the start-up, growth and internationalisation of Government-linked companies (GLCs) due to the support from Temasek and Ministries' funding and also&nbsp;the Development Bank of Singapore of those days.&nbsp; Many successful Singapore GLCs may not have been around without such support and we need to create more of such companies to add to the wealth and the growth of the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Enterprise Singapore\" should, therefore, be complemented&nbsp;with a new Investment Agency or Temasek II, as ACE&nbsp;has called&nbsp;it, which will play a developmental role in investing and grooming promising locally-based private companies to be the GCCs of the future as the Government did for the GLCs in the past. Besides growing local companies, Temasek II should also bring potential foreign GCCs into Singapore by investing in such foreign SMEs.&nbsp; As governments around the world withdraw the massive economic rescue packages, there is a window of opportunity for Singapore to aggressively attract some foreign SMEs here.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am&nbsp;also glad that the ESC's recommendation&nbsp;of a&nbsp;fund to invest in growth companies has been announced. I am glad that&nbsp;this is finally being recognised as a need.&nbsp; Sir, in 2003, a committee which I headed called the SME Financing Panel made this similar recommendation and we produced a report in 2003. Seven years later, the ESC has seen the same need and the Government has responded by setting aside $1.5 billion&nbsp;for this.&nbsp; Sir, the effectiveness of this fund depends on how it is managed and we must remember that the US$1 billion Technology Innovation Program (TIP) fund used to create Venture Capitalists (VCs) here did not succeed in getting many of our&nbsp;local start-ups funded as the VCs chose to invest outside of Singapore after the VCs received Government funds and tax incentives. A growth fund is needed because of market failure and therefore it is unlikely that many private funds will invest in targeted companies that may not yield the type of returns that they&nbsp;may desire. The Government may need to become more proactive in investment decisions rather than to leave it to third party investors. But it is also not optimal for the Government to make investment decisions.&nbsp; I think the best way to go about doing this is for&nbsp;the Government to set up a panel of established business leaders who are given the flexibility to identify suitable businesses to invest in, very much&nbsp;like&nbsp;the SPRING SEEDS programme where&nbsp;we&nbsp;have&nbsp;a panel of private sector experts making investment decisions on behalf of the Government and this has worked well for many years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we will need to re-orientate our approach to turning Singapore into an entrepreneurial hub and to calibrate the playing field, Government-support mechanisms&nbsp;and&nbsp;focus should be&nbsp;on economic activities and spin-offs and move away from local ownership as a qualifying criteria. We should remove the 30% Singaporean ownership criteria for Government grants, loans and incentives so as to support enterprises based on economic activities and&nbsp;not the&nbsp;type of ownership.&nbsp; In this way, we can successfully bring in many entrepreneurs from outside Singapore to be based here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;on R&amp;D, the ESC has repeated the need for innovation and R&amp;D, and this is something all past committees have also highlighted and I believe we have not fully achieved the desired results. While we have done very well in the input factors for example, the amount the Government has spent on R&amp;D, like the $12 billion that Ms Sylvia Lim mentioned, the equivalent outcome of this R&amp;D is far from desirable. The substantial investment in R&amp;D in this recent past has yet to yield the results that we want, especially in commercialisation and tangible start-up spin-offs.&nbsp; The lack of appropriate businesses as receptacles to translate R&amp;D to commercialisation is one reason. The selection of research projects without inputs and guidance from innovative businesses creates another gap.&nbsp; Therefore, without an active involvement of innovative business ecosystem, expenditure on research may not&nbsp;yield the&nbsp;returns that&nbsp;we expect.&nbsp; In this aspect, \"Enterprise Singapore\" could play the role of creating that eco-system. A distributed approach of commercialising R&amp;D residing in respective agencies has so far failed to yield the results that we so desire.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I will&nbsp;give credit to Budget 2010&nbsp;that&nbsp;it has attempted to&nbsp;help companies through the adoption of&nbsp;innovation and&nbsp;technology&nbsp;and to improve the productivity of the workforce. However, we should not waste this opportunity to signal to SMEs that we would like to help them grow and that we have a clear&nbsp;and precise policy&nbsp;to create a level playing&nbsp;field for all of&nbsp;them. I think our SMEs will very much appreciate this gesture from the Government.&nbsp; If we want to grow globally competitive and world-class companies here in Singapore, we will need to take bolder and more definitive steps.

And a lack of know-how can be a real impediment, aside from money.&nbsp; And this may also be a especially relevant in the case of the SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said in his speech during the Budget Debate that in recognising the different circumstances of different industries, specialist centres may be established for the different industries.&nbsp; I am firmly in support of the view that such centres should not only do research and then make the findings available to companies on a pull basis, ie when the companies come and draw the information from the centres, but that the centres should also be open&nbsp;knowledge and leaving hubs that actively engages and distributes knowledge from the applied research to industry through close collaboration with industries' stakeholders; and that is a 'push' approach.&nbsp; And I believe that both 'pull' and 'push' methods are needed concurrently.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask if this is&nbsp;the correct reading of the intent of Government, and if so, whether there is a preliminary thinking on how many such centres&nbsp;and in which industries would be set up, when they would be set up and what resources would be deployed to back them up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Hotel productivity</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to figures from the MTI and the MOM, labour-productivity growth in the hotels and restaurant sector was 4% in 2005 and dropped to 0.4% in 2006 to -6% in 2007 and -9% in 2008.&nbsp; One factor was the seeming difficulty of hotels in Singapore to raise the room rates compared to the situation in major cities in the west and with Asian cities like Hong Kong and Tokyo.&nbsp; A second factor may be the propensity on the part of the many hoteliers to equate service standards with headcount although with a keen eye on cost.&nbsp; The combination of these factors created a gravitation towards lower-fixed pay and smaller core workforce, and the relatively high dependence on part time, temporary, trainee and foreign manpower to provide flexibility and cost effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The high turnover and quality or lack of quality of such workforce is not conducive to training and development and this is in turn bad for industry productivity.&nbsp; Over time, the image and attractiveness of the industry as an employer is also eroded.&nbsp; Growth prospects in the hotel sector remains strong in the medium term with&nbsp;MICE facilities such as the Fullerton Bay Hotel, the Marina Bay Sands and the Resorts World at Sentosa, coming on stream.&nbsp; In this time, it is all the more crucial for companies, workers, unions, Government, to work together to ensure that growth in the sector is sustained by productivity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the only way to uplift profitability, wages, standards and image sustainably and substantially.&nbsp; I would like to know what plans do the MTI and the STB have to uplift&nbsp;productivity&nbsp;and spur innovation in hotel and F&amp;B sector?&nbsp; Would efforts and resources be put into benchmarking, service excellence and people development?&nbsp;&nbsp; How do MTI and STB intend to enlist the partnership of the industry representative bodies and unions in these efforts?&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

There are, in our midst, corporate leaders who still do not see the bigger picture.&nbsp; The importance of investing, in employee training is to drive productivity and employability.&nbsp; These leaders have voiced various concerns in the words of one, \"I do not want to train them and make them marketable.&nbsp; They have no time for training.\"&nbsp; These employers question whether the broad-based training and the diagonal exposure and vertical path progression to value add to employees. Development tracks, as mentioned by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, is indeed the employers&rsquo; responsibility.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These concerns will be stumbling blocks for our Nation's productivity drive.&nbsp; I fear that such leaders fail to understand that Singapore's future growth agenda must stem from a positive mindset of magnanimity, sincerity and an understanding that we are training our employees for a bigger goal and our competition is really not amongst Singaporean companies but the neighbours around us. We must impress upon our corporate leaders the need to think Singapore first.&nbsp;In this productivity journey, we must be able to align every employer to the National Productivity goals.&nbsp;What is the Government's plan on this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Strengthening SME capabilities</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, capability development is important in achieving higher productivity, in particular, human capital management and human capital processes and system, the underpinning foundation is both critical and pivotal to the SMEs' growth and productivity journey.&nbsp;SMEs are well supported in the areas of automation for work processes and market exposure but more attention should be paid to Human Capital Management and development capabilities.&nbsp;Their bigger stumbling block is that, most of the time, they are too small to have a specialised HR function. They gloss over the most strategic aspect of capability development. I urge SPRING Singapore to explore the possibility of setting up an HR service outsourcing hub to give more focus support to SMEs in their HR processes and systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPRING Singapore has the HR tool kit, a DIY for SMEs.&nbsp; I understand that the ones who are benefiting from it are the MNCs, who are happily downloading the tools free of charge (FOC). And they can Do-It-Yourself (DIY) because they have specialist HR function to leverage on these tools.&nbsp;As for SMEs, they do not have specialist HR resources to do-it-yourself, instead, they are saying, do-it-for-me.&nbsp; Sir, to strengthen the human capability management function of the SME, I urge that the WSQ national framework on HR competency qualifications and the HR toolkit induction be taken seriously by agencies as eligibility criteria for companies vying for the respective SQA, ASME or Asian Human Capital Awards.&nbsp; Afterall, these national programmes were mounted to level up the capabilities of companies and their people managers.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim -->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Strengthening SMEs and corporate ecosystem</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wee Siew Kim :</B> Mr Chairman, global and regional competition is growing.&nbsp; At the same time, our businesses face resource constraints, particularly in foreign labour.&nbsp; What are we doing to ensure that our SMEs are equipped to meet this challenge, raise their productivity and expand internationally?&nbsp; As we restructure our overall economy towards higher-value activities and exit from less efficient ones, it is inevitable that many companies, particularly our local SMEs, will have to change their core businesses or move their operations to other countries where costs are lower.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 2006 Budget Debate, I spoke about how our local companies should work together so that we can stake out a bigger slice of the global pie.&nbsp; Co-operation, collaboration and mutual help are key traits best exemplified by Japanese and Taiwanese companies.&nbsp; Not very much has changed in the last four years.&nbsp; There are still only a handful of Singapore companies which have the competence and talent base to compete on a global or regional basis.&nbsp; The Minister&nbsp;of Finance, Mr Tharman, had mentioned in his speech about Singapore Mozaic's success in promoting our local furniture makers collectively.&nbsp; We should have more of such collaborations. We should hunt as a pack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister has mentioned using our business associations as growth champions.&nbsp; I agree that our trade associations and Chambers of Commerce can play a greater role in strengthening our capabilities as we go global.&nbsp; They are the most suitable agents to change the mindsets of our business leaders to think collectively as Team Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that big local companies, especially those which are government-linked, proactively take the lead when going overseas to capture contracts.&nbsp; The Government may wish to consider providing such companies with incentives to do so.&nbsp; This is pack hunting with a lead.&nbsp; I am heartened to note that the Government will commit $100 million over five years to facilitate international market access for members of our business associations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All entrepreneurs have to start somewhere and often fail at the beginning before they can succeed.&nbsp; Hyflux, Creative and many other local enterprises started as SMEs.&nbsp; We need many more Singapore companies like them. Their eventual success translates into more jobs and greater tax revenue for Singapore.&nbsp; Only then, will our economic growth be truly sustainable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has agreed with the ESC recommendation to raise our Gross Expenditure on R&amp;D to 3.5% of GDP over the next five years.&nbsp; In the past, I appealed to the Government to give our local companies extra consideration when procuring services and goods for itself.&nbsp; Such support is vital to grow our own global companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not give them a chance&nbsp;&ndash; a break&nbsp;&ndash; who else would?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I applaud the Government's decision, as a sizeable consumer of products and services, to play a larger role to help innovation-driven companies turn their R&amp;D into marketable solutions on a more proactive and systematic basis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the&nbsp; Government help innovation-driven companies turn R&amp;D into marketable solutions through Public-Private Co-innovation Partnership, we must bear in mind that&nbsp;innovation is not only R&amp;D.&nbsp; For beyond technological innovations, there are also innovations in business models,&nbsp;process,&nbsp;branding that would set our SMEs apart, and they should be given the same level of support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many times, and even in this Debate, it has been mentioned that the&nbsp;Government can&nbsp;play an enabling role, not a deciding role. I do not agree. I certainly understand the Government's concern that policymakers may not be able to pick winners.&nbsp; I suggest that we can adopt the ideology of making it \"market based\" and aligning interests through co-investing.&nbsp; This is because I do not believe that we have the scale and scope for&nbsp;a \"let a thousand flowers bloom\" approach.&nbsp; For Singapore, the risk of picking the wrong seedlings is less than not picking at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest the key aspects of selection criteria should include;&nbsp;substantially Singapore-based companies; equity capital is required to compete overseas;&nbsp;the \"ticket size\" is perceived as too big for the current shareholders and they must have&nbsp;proven success domestically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea of Government co-investment, with businesses taking the lead, is not new. In its earlier form, it had propelled our industrialisation in the 60s. In just the recent past the SRI is based on such a concept.&nbsp; For example, an agency like EDB Investments can co-invest directly in exchange for an equity-like stake. There is certainly a need for growth/patient capital.&nbsp; M&amp;A is a crucial and under-used approach for Singapore companies to grow both domestically and overseas. The&nbsp; GPC&nbsp; had discussed using a new development agency (such as a Temasek II) to support acquisitions where there is a \"ticket size\" issue, especially when it is an overseas acquisition.&nbsp; In so doing, we can quickly build bulk and scope that in many sectors is a key differentiating element. I hope that the Ministry would give serious consideration to this GPC suggestion.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad -->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Some measures certainly favour medium and larger sized companies that are able to transform, invest in R&amp;D and commercialise innovation.&nbsp; However, smaller firms may not have sufficient cash flow to transform and invest in HR due to tight resources.&nbsp; How does MTI plan to help the smaller firms below $10 million in revenue,&nbsp;achieve critical mass so that they can scale to $200 million?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What more can be done for them?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With limited Government resources for industry development, are there key sectors that MTI is counting on to deliver, improve productivity and promote Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) to grow globally competitive companies?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would the MTI consider partnership incentives for MNCs and successful global Singapore firms to help our SMEs enter new overseas market and sub-contractors or business partners?&nbsp; This can be a potential channel to help IE Singapore scale its operations through the use of partner enterprises.&nbsp; One challenge for local businesses here is the high cost of rental and utilities.&nbsp; Can the Ministry share if&nbsp;it has performed a study on what percentage of revenue earned by SMEs goes into rental?&nbsp; The challenge with land scarce in Singapore is that high rentals of businesses are controlled by a small pool of landlords and this form the basis of business costs as everything else comes on top.&nbsp; Anecdotally,&nbsp;many business feedback that for&nbsp;every dollar earned,&nbsp;a high proportion goes into rent and utilities.&nbsp; I fear that this may counter our productivity efforts because in the long run, it might may make it tough for employers to pay workers better, even with higher productivity.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In its drive to identify and assist these promising medium-sized companies, has the Government forgotten about local small businesses like sundry shops and car workshops?

These machines can produce components or even sub-assemblies. With a few companies running the machines at different times, the owners can swop the assets by having 24/7 production and, in doing so, maximise their return on investment in the machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, for common infrastructure needs such as IT systems, warehousing and services such as HR, payroll, finance, IT, inventory and quality control, SMEs should be encouraged to form clusters so that they can reap the benefits of shared infrastructure and services wherever possible.&nbsp;These initiatives will lead to cost savings for SMEs and they can, in turn, focus on becoming more efficient and productive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With all these benefits, Sir, I would like to ask if the Government can incentivise SMEs to enter into such arrangements by co-financing the initial cost for the sharing of machines and services.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Building an inclusive economy</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low:</B> Sir, building an inclusive economy is a key thrust in Budget 2010. If so, while widening and deepening the&nbsp;capabilities of SMEs, would MTI also do the same with non-profit organisations (NPOs), especially social enterprises that intend to do good and do well?&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few of the SME schemes under SPRING and IE Singapore claim to be open to social enterprises (SEs). However, upon closer examination, the fundamentally different value propositions, organisational and cost structures of SEs immediately disqualify themselves from those schemes. If indeed we want an inclusive society, can MTI tweak the qualifying criteria and make it&nbsp;more friendly towards the NPOs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore is an old hand at inter-Ministry priority sector nurturing. For instance, in the ICT sector - with iN2015 plans, IDA works with SPRING to support the Technology Enterprise Commercialisation Scheme (TECS) and provides SMEs with early-stage funding for R&amp;D projects. A Proof-of-Concept grant attracts up to $250,000, while a Proof-of-Value grant 85% co-funding of up to $500,000.&nbsp; In addition, there are also generous opportunities like the&nbsp;Overseas Development Programme and the infocomm Local Industry Upgrading Programme that are created&nbsp;for infocomm local enterprise (ILEs) to collaborate with the infocomm MNCs. Through these initiatives, the local SMEs also get access to the global marketing and distribution networks of their MNC partners, build new capabilities in emerging technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My question therefore is:&nbsp; can we do the same for SEs? Imagine if MTI can work with MCYS to formulate a systematic approach to groom local SEs, treat them like any other priority sector SMEs, not only would we have a more robust and inclusive economy, SEs can also become a strategic partner and a competitive edge in the&nbsp;second budget thrust which is&nbsp;growing global companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me explain that briefly.&nbsp; With IE Singapore, I understand Budget 2010 will&nbsp;encourage \"cluster hunting\" and collaborations between SEs when going overseas.&nbsp;We will then compete with hard-nosed Taiwanese conglomerates, Japanese and Korean <I>chaebols</I> to offer foreign investment, mostly based on price points and competencies,&nbsp;often driving down marginal revenue. My suggestion is:&nbsp;why not strategically include the SEs in the conglomerate, and position ourselves not just as a Singapore Inc, but as Singapore Syinc?&nbsp; In other words, while the pure-for-profit businesses offer their investments and trade, SEs complement it by offering social goods and services which find solutions from within the community to break poverty cycles and help communities to help themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer term, these empowered communities will also become our clients to ensure the success of our SMEs. On the other hand, especially in the developing nations, our local counterparts can also&nbsp;look good and gain popularity for partnering investors with a heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore will be known as&nbsp;the Singapore brand where every citizen will be proud of and feel welcome wherever we go to.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Helping SMEs internationlise</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, in the next 10 years, how will Singapore overcome the intense competition presented by rising Asia?&nbsp; India and China have their own home-grown multinationals.

We should help them to better understand financial products&nbsp;and their risks as well as protection against door-to-door sales and their rights under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The young consumers and the students form&nbsp;another group.&nbsp; It is important to educate this group of consumers as they do spend a lot of money purchasing items like mobile phones, services and lifestyle products.&nbsp;We aim to provide such consumers with some tips and also raise their awareness on legal protection for the purchase of services or products in the area of beauty and electrical and electronic devices as well as mobile phone and related mobile and broadband services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to request MTI to consider providing additional funding support for such initiatives.&nbsp;In addition, I would also like to request MTI to step up enforcement against errant retailers and strengthen its administration of the Consumer Protection, Trade Description and Safety Requirements Act, particularly to enforce this Act against retailers who run afoul of the law such as those who labelled jewellery pieces as of&nbsp;a certain gold fineness standard when they are not and those who imported toys that do not meet the safety requirements.&nbsp; I think these are very dangerous and irresponsible acts.&nbsp;These errant retailers have to be taken to task so the consumer, both locals and foreigners alike, can shop with confidence and ease in Singapore.&nbsp;My recent dialogue session with a group of&nbsp;local jewellers showed that many of the retailers actually are not aware of their legal duties and obligations under this Act.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Timeshare and lemon law</em>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan:</B> Sir, let me declare my interest as the Vice-President of Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).&nbsp; Despite the passing of the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA)&nbsp;in 2003, timeshare and&nbsp;its related complaints have topped the complaints chart&nbsp;at the Consumers Association for the sixth consecutive year.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2004, there were some 100 complaints relating to the sale of time share products.&nbsp; From 2005 to 2009, every year, the complaint figures have hovered above the 200 mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general complaints are related to breaches of CPFTA&nbsp;in areas such as misleading and/or false claims, undue pressure and failing to inform about or honour the cooling-off period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CASE had already taken injunction proceedings against three timeshare-related companies.&nbsp; However, under the Act, such proceedings take a while to be concluded and companies have taken advantage of this time lag to wind down their operations and to start new outfits to operate as before with exactly the same management.&nbsp; This is a brazen move to skirt the laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe timeshare legislation is both timely and necessary to address this issue and to offer more comprehensive protection for consumers.&nbsp; We need to make it unlawful for individuals who have engaged in such unfair trade practices to close their operations and then reopen the businesses to perpetuate the same activities.&nbsp; May I urge MTI to reconsider its decision and to introduce legislation to protect consumers in this area?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MTI had earlier accepted the proposal of CASE for the introduction of lemon laws in Singapore.&nbsp; I would like to ask for an update.&nbsp; Has the legislation been drafted?&nbsp; And if so, when can we expect the first reading?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran):</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, first, I would like to thank Members for the wide range of issues that they have raised. My Minister has set out MTI&rsquo;s overall strategy to take advantage of growth opportunities as our economy recovers. I will supplement his response by addressing specific questions that Members have raised&nbsp;by relating to three broad areas &ndash; tourism, energy, and research and development.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first, tourism. Last year was a difficult year for Singapore&rsquo;s tourism industry. Visitor arrivals to Singapore declined by about 4%&nbsp;from 2008 to reach 9.7 million, though this exceeded the Singapore Tourism Board&rsquo;s (STB) projection of 9 million to 9.5 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We start 2010 with clear signs of recovery. Visitor arrivals registered overall positive growth from the fourth quarter of last year and surpassed 900,000 in January this year. This is the highest ever recorded for the month of January. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) forecasts international tourist arrivals to grow between 3% to 4% in 2010, with Asia leading this rebound. STB projects our visitor arrivals in 2010 to increase by more than 20% to between 11.5 million&nbsp;and 12.5 million. Tourism receipts are expected to be $17.5 to $18.5 billion, which is about 40% above 2009 levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Muhammad Faishal has asked how we will tap on the growth of Asian markets. Our destination appeal to Asian visitors is strong. In 2009, more than 70% of our visitors came from Asia. Indonesia, China, India and Malaysia were four of Singapore's top five source markets by visitor arrivals and tourism receipts&nbsp;&ndash; in other words, both quantity and value. Vietnam is another promising market registering double digit growth of 11% last year. The Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA) forecasts that Singapore will be India's top outbound destination in the next two years. PATA also expects Singapore to be among the top four destinations to be visited by Chinese travellers, excluding Hong Kong and Macau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further strengthen our destination awareness in the major Asian markets, STB has undertaken several key branding and marketing initiatives. Our participation at the World Expo in Shanghai, from May to October this year, is one example. The Singapore Pavilion will showcase our city as a place to live, work and play to the 70 million Chinese and international visitors. Last year, STB entered a three-year marketing partnership with VISA that will not only attract more visitors to Singapore but also to help stimulate their spending here. With Internet penetration increasing worldwide, STB is also focusing on digital media marketing to seek out the growing pool of IT-savvy travellers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This marketing effort is complemented by a suite of key projects which are coming to fruition. Mr Chairman, these projects will transform our tourism landscape and further differentiate Singapore from other tourist destinations &ndash; a point that Dr Muhammad Faishal&nbsp;raised. Combined with our strong air connectivity, we are in a strong position to capitalise on the economic recovery and to tap on the Asia&rsquo;s growing markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advent of the two Integrated Resorts (IRs) will contribute significantly to our tourism landscape on two counts. First, with internationally acclaimed shows, events, restaurants, and Southeast Asia&rsquo;s largest theme park, the IRs will enhance the quality and variety of our tourism offerings. Second, these changes ushered in by the Integrated Resorts will enable us to achieve longer stays and higher yields from our visitors, which is our objective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STB is also collaborating with the IRs to maximise the benefit from their facilities and resources. One example is the support STB has given the Integrated Resorts to secure new BTMICE events for Singapore. Through this partnership, Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World at Sentosa will host a range of BTMICE events which are projected to draw in more than 11,000 visitors to Singapore this year.&nbsp; With the IRs opening in phases, the full benefits of these new tourism products will only be realised over the next few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has also been a quantum leap in our events landscape. Flagship events like the Formula One (F1) night race and the F1 Rocks concert have elevated Singapore&rsquo;s international standing as a global city with a vibrant lifestyle. The F1 races in 2008 and 2009 collectively brought in over 70,000 overseas visitors and generated about $260 million in incremental tourism receipts. Each race also profiles us to a \"live\" television audience around the world of about 100 million. We will continue to refresh the F1 and enrich the entertainment content, to ensure that Singapore remains a must-see event on the F1 calendar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our tourism precincts are also constantly being refreshed. Last year, the opening of three new retail malls, ION Orchard, Orchard Central and&nbsp;313@Somerset, complemented our makeover of Orchard Road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other key projects in the pipeline include Gardens by the Bay, River Safari which is a project by the Wildlife Reserves Singapore, and the International Cruise Terminal, all of which will open over the next two to three years. STB will also develop more signature events, such as the Asia Fashion Exchange, to position Singapore on the international stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this array of initiatives, Singapore is well positioned to ride the growth in the global and Asian tourism market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, I will now move on to address Members&rsquo; questions related to our energy policy.&nbsp;We are currently in a healthy position to meet our energy needs. Our total generation capacity is in excess of 10 gigawatts, which is more than sufficient to meet our peak electricity demand of&nbsp;six gigawatts. However, given that we import almost all our energy, Singapore remains exposed to the vicissitudes of global energy markets and faces several challenges. Firstly, notwithstanding the brief respite during the recession, global energy prices are on a long-term upward trend, driven by energy demand in Asia. There will also be intermittent bouts of energy price volatility due to the business cycle and other episodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, and consequently, there is a global race to secure adequate and reliable energy supplies from diverse sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, our energy plans must accommodate the possibility of a carbon constrained future. Singapore has committed to reduce carbon emissions substantially as part of a global deal on climate change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our goal is to make Singapore a Smart Energy Economy with an energy ecosystem that is secure, sustainable and competitive. Our strategy to meet the global energy challenges rests on two key thrusts: diversification and competitive energy markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government agrees with the Economic Strategies Committee&rsquo;s (ESC) recommendation to adopt a portfolio approach towards energy &ndash; in other words, no one energy option will be adequate to meet our varied energy objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal is one important step towards a more diversified energy portfolio. It will enhance the resilience and competitiveness of our energy supply by providing access to an integrated global LNG market that draws from gas sources from around the world. The project is on track for completion in the year 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the advent of our LNG terminal, we must consider a range of energy options, based on emerging technologies and new sources, to meet our long-term needs. We will adopt a pragmatic approach by evaluating the alternatives on the basis of energy security, economic viability and environmental sustainability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, allow me to elaborate on solar energy, nuclear energy and other energy options, in response to Members&rsquo; questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the renewable energy sources currently available, solar is one of the more promising in our context for electricity generation. While still relatively expensive today, solar energy prices could achieve grid parity in the medium term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as pointed out by Dr Fatimah Lateef, in order to harness solar energy effectively, we need to develop the infrastructure. We must upgrade our building infrastructure for efficient installation and integration of solar panels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has put in place incentive schemes to develop capabilities in these areas and to test-bed new technologies. The $20 million Solar Capability Scheme (SCS) encourages innovations in the design and integration of solar panels in private sector buildings. For example, this scheme supported the 500-kilowatt peak solar photo-voltaic (PV) system at Resorts World Sentosa, the largest single system in Singapore to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public buildings like Changi Airport&rsquo;s Budget Terminal, the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Ngee Ann Polytechnic are also active participants in our solar test-bedding and industry development initiatives.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who wish to install solar PV (photo-voltaic) systems, Dr Fatimah Lateef raised this point, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) and the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) recently published a comprehensive <I>Handbook for&nbsp;Solar Photovoltaic (PV)&nbsp;Systems</I>.&nbsp;EMA also provides information on Licensed Electrical Workers (LEWs) who have the skills to install, maintain and test solar installations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, given the limited potential for renewable sources to meet our base load electricity requirements, it is imperative that we explore other options as well.&nbsp; In that regard, MTI agrees with the ESC recommendation that we should study the feasibility of nuclear energy and develop expertise in nuclear energy technologies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Members have listed a range of pros and cons and asked why are we prepared to study nuclear energy as an option now. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, it can potentially enhance energy security, reduce carbon emissions, and mitigate the impact of volatile oil and gas prices &ndash; thus it could meet potentially all our objectives embedded in the national energy policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, several developed countries have been using nuclear energy for a long time and many others are now considering nuclear energy seriously.&nbsp; France has been using nuclear energy since the 1960s and currently generates 80% of its electricity from this source.&nbsp; Small countries like Switzerland and island-nations like Japan have also made significant strides in the use of nuclear energy over the last four decades.&nbsp; These are developed nations with high standards of living and exacting safety regulations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nuclear energy option is also being revived and explored in many countries.&nbsp; According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), China is expected to build 25 new nuclear power plants by 2020, a rate of two new plants a year.&nbsp; In the US, loan guarantees totaling US$8 billion have recently been approved for two new nuclear power plants.&nbsp; Closer to home, in ASEAN, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia have all begun exploring nuclear energy as an option with different timelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked whether there is an ASEAN stand on the issue. I think each country has evolved its own strategy and policy towards this. But at the ASEAN level, there is an effort to try and develop a common understanding on what would constitute a nuclear energy safety regime in this part of the world. Thirdly, science and technology have evolved much since nuclear power plants were first built 50 years ago. Dr Lam Pin Min has noted the challenges associated with nuclear energy given Singapore's location, size and urban density.&nbsp; Indeed, these were some of the reasons for not considering the option before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But new technologies are being developed to address some of the key concerns associated with nuclear energy, and to make nuclear reactors smaller and safer, at a lower cost and with less high-level waste. Some of these technologies are in early stages of commercialisation and we need to study if they could be feasible in our context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is merit in building up our knowledge and expertise in nuclear science which has applications in diagnostic medicine and cancer treatment.&nbsp; Research and development in this field is promising and could potentially yield therapeutic and economic benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Muhammad Faishal has raised the issue of public concern over the potential use of nuclear energy in Singapore.&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Liang Eng Hwa have asked if the risks associated with nuclear energy are acceptable.&nbsp; It is precisely to address these and other valid questions and concerns that we need to embark on a feasibility study of nuclear energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI will, therefore, lead a multi-agency effort to undertake this feasibility study.&nbsp; The aim is to ensure that we fully understand, and objectively evaluate from all perspectives the opportunities, challenges and risks involved with nuclear energy.&nbsp; The study will commence later this year.&nbsp; It will entail a careful, deliberate and rigorous examination of the technical, economic and safety aspects of nuclear energy. It is premature at this stage to talk about details such as what form, and so on, which Dr Muhammad Faishal raised.&nbsp; What we should acknowledge is that this is an important first step in assessing a possible long-term energy option for Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, for the medium term, we also need to keep our options open for other sources of conventional energy to further diversify our energy portfolio.&nbsp; These options will&nbsp; have to be considered on a market basis, after our LNG demand has stabilised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Sylvia&nbsp;Lim has asked about the implications of using coal and electricity imports in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean coal could be a component of our energy diversification strategy.&nbsp; Currently, coal makes up more than 40% of global power generation.&nbsp; And, it is expected to remain at this level until at least 2030 given the relative abundance of coal sources in the world.&nbsp; Coal also has a cost advantage though this may be eroded by any future global carbon pricing regime.&nbsp; However, combustion technology is evolving, making coal cleaner than before and we must, therefore, keep this option open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precisely because the technology is evolving, I do not think it is necessarily a step back to consider this as a possible option for ourselves, a point that Ms Sylvia Lim raised. Electricity imports could also help us gain access to alternative sources of energy such as hydropower from the region and also free up valuable land in Singapore.&nbsp;Ms Lim asked what are the risks of importing electricity.&nbsp;In a sense, it is a very similar risk to importing the fuel in order to generate the electricity locally. The key additional risk factors would really be a reliance on the infrastructure that conveys the electricity to Singapore. So, we will study the safeguards necessary to mitigate any risk from being exposed to a disruption in imported electricity supply and how it could feature potentially as part of our overall energy system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second plank of our energy strategy is to keep our energy markets competitive.&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim has asked about energy pricing and let me just set out the broad framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are price-takers in the global energy market because we are small and import almost all our energy requirements.&nbsp; We therefore must allow the full cost of energy to be reflected in prices.&nbsp; Subsidising energy would be encouraging wasteful consumption and it will also be a drain on public finances.&nbsp; Many countries which subsidise energy, including oil and gas producers, have found to their detriment that they impose an unsustainable fiscal burden over time.&nbsp; Instead, our approach is to provide targeted assistance through the Utilities-Save (U-Save) and other schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we promote competition in our energy markets to keep prices competitive.&nbsp; As evidenced since liberalisation in 2001, fuel oil prices have gone up by about 160% and our tariffs have risen by about 15%. That is not a bad track record.&nbsp; This is an ongoing process and in the last year, we have also taken a number of additional steps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last year's COS, I informed the House that EMA was studying ways to inject more competition into the household electricity market.&nbsp; EMA has since completed the tender of 10% of household electricity demand.&nbsp; The tendered price will be incorporated into the electricity tariff starting from April 2010.&nbsp; Going forward, EMA will put out more tranches for tender and the savings will be passed on to households.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman,&nbsp;Sir, in the long term, EMA is working towards opening up the household electricity&nbsp; market for competition so that consumers will be able to purchase electricity direct from different suppliers through a range of retail packages that they offer.&nbsp; Ms Lim&nbsp;asked whether the Government will allow such retail electricity sellers to use a tiered system. Once such a market is established, then we should leave it to the market to work out what are the different ways they can meet customer needs.&nbsp; But it is quite a different question which is a point that Ms Sylvia Lim also alluded to, whether Government should in fact be introducing a tiered structure at this stage.&nbsp;We&nbsp;have had this discussion before and I want to just re-emphasise the key point. If we were to introduce a tiered system today, it means Government is deciding what is an acceptable level of electricity consumption and establish that as the threshold, as Ms Sylvia Lim puts it, and the Government then has to decide&nbsp;at what level of additional&nbsp;manageable threshold should be. This is quite a problematic process in terms of determining the key levels of thresholds. So it would be far superior to allow&nbsp;the market to work, for us to give targeted subsidies to those who need it and when the market is fully liberalised, the players can then work out the schemes as we see in other sectors like telecoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to research and development (R&amp;D).&nbsp;R&amp;D cannot be viewed in isolation from the broader innovation ecosystem that we seek to create.&nbsp;The ESC has recommended that we make innovation pervasive and strengthen the commercialisation of R&amp;D.&nbsp;Indeed, these are MTI's priorities too.&nbsp;Ms Sylvia&nbsp;Lim has asked how the outcomes and output of our R&amp;D sector compare with other advanced economies. As she has acknowledged, it is a difficult matter to measure and there is no single measure for this, so let me just highlight just three aspects: the generation of intellectual property, the degree to which public R&amp;D helps to catalyse private R&amp;D, and the extent to which R&amp;D leads to economic activity or commercialisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In of the area of IP creation, our R&amp;D sector is broadly comparable to other advanced countries.&nbsp; The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report ranks Singapore 11th globally, in terms of patents per 1,000 population, ahead of countries like the Netherlands and Denmark.&nbsp;In terms of published Science and Engineering papers per 1,000 population, we are ahead of OECD countries like Japan and South Korea.&nbsp;However, we still have some way to go before we can close the gap with countries like Sweden and Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the ratio of public sector to private sector spending on R&amp;D, we are on par with countries like the Netherlands and Denmark.&nbsp; Our private R&amp;D investments are twice that of our public sector&nbsp;&ndash; a significant improvement from 20 years ago when public and private investments were equal.&nbsp; It also has resulted in ventures such as the strategic alliance between Roche and our medical and&nbsp;scientific institutions.&nbsp; This partnership which will expand the knowledge of disease biology&nbsp;to develop new personalised treatment approaches has brought in private R&amp;D investment&nbsp;of close to $100 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with regard to economic spin-offs and commercialisation, we have made good progress.&nbsp;A*STAR's spin-off, A-Bio, for example, has been catalysing the growth of a new biologics segment within our biomedical sector. In the past three years, Singapore has secured six major biologics manufacturing investments totaling more than $2 billion.&nbsp;SMEs have also benefited from our public sector R&amp;D capabilities. One example, is CEI Contract Manufacturing Ltd, which with the help of a scientist from A*STAR,&nbsp;will be&nbsp;able to qualify its product for High Level Assembly and Testing&nbsp;to meet a US customer's standard.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we are not lagging or underperforming&nbsp;like Ms Sylvia Lim asked, but we can do more in the commercialisation of R&amp;D &ndash; which is also a key recommendation of the ESC.&nbsp;To that end, in the next phase of our R&amp;D development, we aim to facilitate greater collaboration between private sector and public sector R&amp;D, creating the infrastructure for test-bedding innovative solutions, and establishing platforms for industry practitioners and researchers in academia and institutes to work together on research projects that can potentially lead to commercial application and value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key success factor for our R&amp;D drive is the availability of a deep pool of scientific talent.&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim has asked about the extent to which locals are part of this talent pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents take up the majority of R&amp;D jobs, and this share has been increasing over time.&nbsp;Based on the <I>2008 National R&amp;D survey</I>, there were more than 25,000 research scientists and engineers in Singapore, of which about 21,000 were Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents. Between 2001 and 2008, the number of Singapore citizen and Permanent Resident research scientists and engineers has grown at 8% per annum, compared to 5% per annum for non-locals. Amongst the population of PhD students, the proportion of SCs and PRs have grown from 22% to 26% in the same period, that is, 2001 and 2008, and this number of PhDs will increase further as many of the PhD scholars under A*STAR scheme return to work in Singapore&nbsp;under&nbsp;various institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I want to conclude on this point by making one key observation.&nbsp;We have been able to grow our local R&amp;D talent not because we have protected them or kept out foreign talent.&nbsp;Rather, they have done well because we have created a vibrant R&amp;D community that attracts and develops the best and brightest, both local and international, and that will continue to shape the way we go forward with our R&amp;D strategy and the development of our manpower pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, to conclude:&nbsp;MTI's policies on tourism, energy and R&amp;D have served us well and will continue to evolve as we adapt to seize the opportunities in the years ahead.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>4.00 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan):</B> Mr Chairman, let me start by thanking Members who spoke enthusiatically about supporting our SMEs in raising productivity and competitiveness.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SMEs, as a group, contribute half of Singapore's GDP and they account for six out of every 10 persons employed.&nbsp;And, yet, they are only half as productive as the average firm in Singapore.&nbsp;There is much room for improvement, and SMEs play a critical role in determining the success of our productivity drive.&nbsp; MTI is committed to supporting SMEs to build up capabilities to raise productivity and increase competitiveness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will set&nbsp;out MTI's strategy for supporting businesses to raise productivity at three levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, we must ensure that our overall business environment remains favourable to large and small businesses alike.&nbsp; At the sectoral level, we will support our industries in working together to address productivity gaps.&nbsp; At the firm level, we will help SMEs build capabilities and create value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the macro level, we need to ensure that our business environment remains conducive to all businesses. Entrepreneurs must be able to start and grow businesses easily.&nbsp;We have been quite successful in this area.&nbsp;For four years in a row, the World Bank has ranked Singapore as the easiest place to do business, out of 183 economies.&nbsp;And, yet, we must continue to improve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the Pro-Enterprise Panel, we have received close to 1,800 suggestions from businesses to cut red tape.&nbsp;We have adopted half of them.&nbsp;We will continue to find ways to reduce, simplify, or to do away with bureaucratic complexities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked whether an entrepreneurial culture has taken root in Singapore.&nbsp; I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) for their work in promoting an entrepreneurial culture in Singapore.&nbsp;Successive batches of entrepreneurs have contributed to this movement.&nbsp;Today, we celebrate entrepreneurship. We have many more successful role models.&nbsp;There is also a greater social acceptance of entrepreneurship as a career choice among our young and educated.&nbsp; A survey shows that more than 60% of our start-up founders are below 40 years old, and about three-quarters of them have at least tertiary-level education.&nbsp;NUS, NTU and SMU house 120 promising start-ups in their incubators. ITEs and polytechnics run business plan competitions.&nbsp;Even our primary schools have children educated on entrepreneurship programme today.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh, who is a passionate advocate for entrepreneurship, asked if the Government can do more in this area.&nbsp; The answer is: Yes, we can and we will.&nbsp; We clearly must build up our entrepreneurship ecosystem to anchor a critical mass of start-ups, angel investors, VCs and deal-flow network.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an effort to render Singapore as a meeting place amongst business angels from Asia, SPRING Singapore, ACE and the Singapore-based Business Angel Network of Southeast Asia (BANSEA) are organising an inaugural Asian Business Angels Forum today and tomorrow.&nbsp;The forum brings together 150 business angels, entrepreneurs and their respective networks from 14 different countries. In line with this, the newly announced Tax Deduction for Angel Investors Scheme will catalyse more of such investments in our start-ups.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A vibrant business environment is not only one where new firms form readily. It is also one where there is&nbsp;a continuous advancement towards higher value activities in&nbsp;a virtuous&nbsp;cycle of renewal.&nbsp;Economists would call this \"creative destruction\" &ndash;&nbsp;the basis for \"disruptive innovation\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked what the ESC recommendations will mean for low-value activity in Singapore.&nbsp; I think he&nbsp;cited the sundry shop and car repair shop as examples.&nbsp; Well, economical speaking, in any free market competition, the fittest survive.&nbsp;Companies engaged in low-value activities cannot hope to do things the same way as they have been in the past 10 or 20 years. They must upgrade, innovate and focus on value creation, or they will lose their customers to competition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is exactly how the furniture industry in Singapore has transformed itself over the years.&nbsp; In 1993, as an EDB Centre Director based in Washington DC, I received an incoming delegation from the Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC).&nbsp;After meeting up, we went on to call on the leading furniture distributors in the east coast of the US, hoping to convince them to \"buy Singapore\".&nbsp;When SFIC showed their brochures to a leading US furniture retailer, the Vice President receiving us said, \"Let's be frank, for furniture of this standard, I can make it in my own garage!\"&nbsp; Imagine the shock on our faces then.&nbsp;What a blunt rejection!&nbsp;It was a wake-up call. SFIC came home to Singapore. They went back to the drawing board.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The furniture scene in Singapore is completely different today.&nbsp;We have \"graduated\" out of the space of low-cost manufacturing. Our furniture companies are now moving towards \"Original Design Manufacturers\". Many market their products under their own brands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang, in his speech, asked what is the Government doing for the sunset industry.&nbsp;In this case, what was once a sunset industry in Singapore has been completely rejuvenated and given a new lease of life. I think, you are sunset when you think you are sunset.&nbsp; This was possible because SFIC members innovated and transformed.&nbsp;SFIC even created a strategic blueprint describing where they want to be in the next five years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The success of&nbsp;our companies and industries ultimately rests on their own drive, innovation and entreprenuerial effort.&nbsp;Entrepreneurs such as Ron Sim of&nbsp;OSIM and Olivia Lum of Hyflux, established their successful businesses with very little in the beginning and&nbsp;with sheer resourcefulness throughout.&nbsp; The furniture industry in Singapore made the bold decision to renew itself and we have supported them in doing so.&nbsp;For all who are willing to upgrade and innovate, the Government is always ready to support.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are often productivity gains to be found by looking across companies to identify scope for collaboration.&nbsp;One example, raised by Dr Ahmad Magad, would be the sharing of resources such as infrastructure and services among SMEs.&nbsp; Indeed, this is a great way for SMEs to aggregate demand and leverage on economies of scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo suggested that one such initiative could be the setting up of a HR service outsourcing hub, and to give more focused support to SMEs in this important area.&nbsp; It is a good suggestion&nbsp;which SPRING&nbsp;will look into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the example of hotels and restaurants sector, as highlighted by Mr Heng Chee How.&nbsp; It may be amongst the productivity laggards today. But there is no reason why our hotels and restaurants cannot aspire to become the most innovative, most service-oriented and most technology-savvy in the world.&nbsp; To make this happen, it is crucial that the industry work closer together to pursue common productivity improvements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years ago, I was told that Raffles Holdings Group realised that they were paying high prices for daily consumables such as tissue papers, soaps, combs and other toiletries.&nbsp;So they came up with an idea &ndash; to build a web-based purchasing system open to other hotels in Singapore, so that by aggregating demand, they can secure the best pricing from suppliers.&nbsp; One participant recalled that he experienced 10% to 15% savings from using the system.&nbsp;In this case, the leadership of one company in the industry led to the cost savings for all the players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Industry associations can play an important role in rallying their members to secure sectoral productivity gains.&nbsp;Consider, for instance, the Textile and Fashion Federation (TaFf). Many of their members wanted to re-engineer their&nbsp;systems and processes for greater production efficiency.&nbsp; But none were in the position to employ full-time engineers.&nbsp; So what TaFf did, was to train up a pool of engineers and deploy them across their members. As a result, members were able to tap on much-needed expertise in a cost-efficient manner. This is a good initiative on the part of TaFf.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have good mechanisms to support industry associations which aspire to improve. Since 2005, SPRING and IE Singapore have committed $50 million under the Local Enterprise and Association Development (LEAD) programme, to help 22 associations run projects just like the one I have described.&nbsp; The additional $100 million that the Minister for Finance has announced will&nbsp; further scale up the support for business associations.&nbsp; I strongly encourage our associations to work closely with SPRING and IE Singapore to help member companies raise productivity and expand their presence overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Heng Chee How asked about the development of a centre for research&nbsp;on productivity and innovation.&nbsp; I would like to highlight that SMEs can already access five Centres of Innovation (COIs) set up by SPRING with polytechnics and research institutes.&nbsp; The five centres cover food manufacturing, marine and offshore engineering, environment and water technology, precision engineering and electronics. This sectoral infrastructure, each capital-intensive in nature, allows SMEs to tap on scientific expertise and resources in the form of manpower training, technology consultancy, prototyping and testing to become better in their processes and products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will study how to strengthen further the existing network of Centres of Innovation or to create new ones if need be. We are studying the modalities and appropriate models for doing so. These centres will do applied research on sector-specific productivity, identify international best practices, and develop productivity benchmarks that benefit the entire industry sector.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As many Members have emphasised today and during the Budget debate, boosting productivity does not mean working harder and longer.&nbsp; As Mdm Ho Geok Choo stresses, employers must take the lead, including training their workers to be more skilled and more effective at what they do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zaqy Mohamad has raised concerns about high costs running counter to our productivity efforts.&nbsp; Given Singapore's size and circumstances, it is inevitable that we will face resource constraints.&nbsp; But this does not mean we cannot create&nbsp;business models that will help us overcome these constraints and prosper. Growing revenue top line and profitability through innovative products and services becomes an imperative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is why we should shift our focus to value creation.&nbsp; Much has been said&nbsp;about the \"hows\"&nbsp;&ndash; that is, the efficiency of doing things, or doing things right.&nbsp; But I think it is important to take a step back and ask about \"what\" &ndash; meaning what should we do, or doing the Right Thing.&nbsp; Are we competing based on value creation or on cost efficiency?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&nbsp;me illustrate with some examples of innovative companies that have done exactly this. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of us cannot do without our daily staple of&nbsp;<I>kopi-o</I> and soft-boiled eggs for breakfast.&nbsp; But Tippling Club at Dempsey has taken it one step further. They have come up with a fancy cocktail drink based on&nbsp;<I>kopi-o</I> which is served with eggs.&nbsp; To create its menu of unique \"food-cocktails\", they invested substantially in food science technology and introduced the concept of \"molecular gastronomy\" to their concoctions.&nbsp; In fact, it was through much research and experimentation that the mixologist discovered that the optimal temperature for the eggs has to be at 62 degrees Celsius&nbsp;&ndash; not higher, not lower, to taste its best.&nbsp; With food science as their edge, the Tippling Club creates not just cocktails, but an experience its customers have never had before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Another innovative company is Azimuth.&nbsp;When we think of luxury watches, we think of Swiss brands like Rolex and Patek Philippe.&nbsp;But Azimuth is Singapore's home-grown luxury watch company that designs in Singapore and manufactures in Switzerland.&nbsp; It takes an unconventional route to design. It created the world's first single-hand watch that moves anti-clockwise.&nbsp;So&nbsp;it is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;optical illusion when you look at the watch face. It has another watch that is modelled after a robot. There is even one that has a functioning roulette wheel as a watch dial to commemorate the opening of IRs here.&nbsp; By making watches that do not look like a traditional three-hand watch, Azimuth defines a niche for itself.

For the willing and determined, SPRING offers a comprehensive range of capability development programmes to assist them.&nbsp; In fact, Mr Liang Eng Hwa earlier has mentioned that 154 schemes&nbsp;can be&nbsp;found on the website. The programmes range from IT upgrading, HR and process innovation, to design, product development, branding and business management systems.&nbsp; In 2009, SPRING helped more than 3,000 companies in the many areas mentioned.&nbsp; We will ramp up our capacities to help&nbsp;at both the firm and&nbsp;sectoral levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Mr Wee Siew Kim asked what we are doing to enable SMEs to internationlise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, IE Singapore's new SME Market Access Programme will complement its existing suite of schemes to help internationalising SMEs. The programme will help SMEs defray the developmental cost of entering new markets, such as fees incurred for engaging distributors, professional services and certification.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Wee Siew Kim and Mr Zaqy Mohamad have correctly pointed out the importance of \"hunting as a pack\" in entering overseas markets.&nbsp;By doing so, companies can complement their product offerings and achieve economies of scale, and hence strengthen their overall competitiveness and maximise their chances&nbsp;of success.&nbsp;I encourage companies to tap on IE's iPartners programme to form and develop such business alliances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Mr Inderjit Singh has asked if an agency called \"Enterprise Singapore\" is required to help Singapore companies&nbsp;grow into globally competitive companies. While there may be many benefits to combine several agencies into one, as proposed by Mr Singh, there would also be operating trade-offs too. I think the most important point about his suggestion is that there should be seamless and integrated support provided to growing SMEs, whether in the area of capacity building, internationalisation or productivity enhancement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, in recent years, our economic agencies have been working towards a more seamless service model for SMEs.&nbsp; At the board level, EBD, SPRING and IE Singapore are represented on each other's boards. At the operational level, SPRING and IE Singapore share information on account management of key accounts in key sectors. Certain capacity building programmes, such as branding capability and SME financing, are jointly administered by the two or more agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In enterprise development, SPRING serves 3,000 SMEs in 2009.&nbsp; In the same period, IE Singapore provided support to 4,700 companies in internationalisation-related services.&nbsp; Enterprise development requires active cooperation amongst agencies with complementary expertise. SPRING and IE Singapore will continue to work closely together to support SMEs in raising their productivity in a seamless fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would now turn to Miss Penny Low's query on the role that we can play in supporting the development of social enterprises.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MTI's mission is to maximise economic benefits for Singapore. As long as enterprises, including social enterprises, are able to create jobs and contribute to Singapore's economy, upgrading support for productivity improvements will be available to them.&nbsp; In fact, social enterprises can also tap on other assistance schemes provided by MCYS, such as the Comcare Enterprise Fund (CEF).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; City College Holdings Limited is one example.&nbsp; It is a social enterprise which provides effective and affordable education to private candidates taking GCE 'O' level examinations.&nbsp; Under SPRING's LETAS grant, City College implemented an Academic Information Management System to improve the efficiency of its administrative process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, let me reiterate that the new productivity drive is a national effort that requires everyone to play his part. At the broad level, what the Government can do and will do, is to ensure that we have a conducive environment for all businesses, large and small, to conduct their businesses with ease.&nbsp; Industries and enterprises must take their lead in drawing up their own roadmap towards higher productivity. For those who are ready to rise up to the challenge, the Government stands ready to provide our maximum support.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Sam Tan Chin Siong):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to&nbsp;certainly thank the Members for their views and&nbsp;their contributions on important issues such as internationalisation of our companies&nbsp;riding on the Asian waves as well as consumer protection.&nbsp; My Minister and Minister of State (MOS) had earlier talked about Singapore's internationalisation efforts.&nbsp;So on this subject, Mr Teo Ser Luck, Mdm Ho Geok Choo and Mr Wee Siew Kim asked how Singapore is tapping on both China and India's growth.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the foreseeable future, G3 countries will remain the key drivers for Singapore's external demand.&nbsp; But emerging markets in Asia, particularly in China and India, also present exciting opportunities for us.&nbsp; Already, the share of trade with Asia has been increasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten years ago, China and India accounted for 5.7% of our total trade.&nbsp; Today, this has risen to 13%. The potential for further growth is therefore very strong.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to realise this potential, Singapore needs to capitalise on two key trends which will underpin the rise of Asia.&nbsp; First, Asia will experience a surge in its middle-class.&nbsp; In China alone, this strata, which is often defined as people enjoying an income of at least RMB 25,000 a year, currently accounts for 12% of China's population and this is expected to grow to 75% by the 2030.&nbsp; Similarly, India's middle-class will also grow from around 5% to 10% today to about 90% by the 2030. This trend is also seen in varying degrees across most of Asia.&nbsp; What this means is a rise in the spending power, which will drive demand for quality products and services that will go beyond healthcare and education, into other lifestyle services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.23 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, most Asians will live,&nbsp;work and play in&nbsp;rapidly&nbsp;urbanising city centres.&nbsp; In China, we are seeing strong signs of this, with large migrant populations moving into cities.&nbsp; By 2025, there will be eight mega cities in China with&nbsp;populations of more than 10 million each.&nbsp; In India, the three mega cities in Mumbai,&nbsp;Delhi and Kolkata will also have some of the largest and fastest growing cities in the world.&nbsp; This rapid urbanisation will add to the demand for infrastructure development and new services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against this backdrop, Singapore is well-positioned to leverage on strengths that we have built up over the years, such as systems integration and modern services provision.&nbsp; For example, our ST Electronics was a key player in setting up Beijing metro's&nbsp;state-of-the-art command and control system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singapore companies can provide high quality and high value products and services that have the potential to meet the rising demands in Asia.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;Etonhouse provides quality pre-school and international school education in Indonesia, Malaysia, India and China.&nbsp;&nbsp;BreadTalk Group and Charles&nbsp;&amp; Keith have also established a strong retail presence within Asia, in countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and China. They can scale up their operations in emerging new cities with the rise of China, and also other parts of Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, our economic agencies will step up efforts to help companies expand overseas. We will continue to strengthen our bilateral ties, improve existing trade and investment facilitative agreements, help companies understand the evolving markets better, enhance our outreach and also our ground presence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In many ways, we are reaping the benefits of our pro-active engagements of key markets,&nbsp;having recognised the value of growing our external wing early. In China, we undertook the Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) project 15 years ago, with the intent of transferring our developmental experience to China.&nbsp;In the process, we established strong bilateral economic ties and also built up the Singapore brand name in China.&nbsp;This has contributed to Singapore and our companies' familiarity with the Chinese business environment.&nbsp;It also further deepens our partnership with China. We have embarked on the Tianjin Eco-city and this is our second G-to-G flagship project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bilateral ties were further enhanced via the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (CSFTA) and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area agreement (ACFTA), which came into force recently. These FTAs have lower trade barriers and also created new opportunities for Singapore-based companies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make deeper inroads into China, we established seven provincial-level business councils, with the latest two being in Jiangsu and Guangdong. These councils are set up in regions where Singapore businesses have a strong interest.&nbsp; Co-chaired by Ministers or Ministers of State, these councils promote economic cooperation and facilitate networking between the business communities of both countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We have had considerable success with the councils.&nbsp; For example, under the auspicies of the Singapore-Jiangsu Cooperation Council, a consortium of Singapore companies comprises Yanlord, Surbana and SembCorp secured&nbsp;a choice site from the Jiangsu province for the Nanjing Eco High-Tech Island project. Through the council, IE Singapore was able to uncover downstream opportunities for other Singapore players.&nbsp; IE Singapore has helped the consortium to link up with&nbsp;over 25 companies, including SMEs, on this project.&nbsp; In 2009 alone, IE Singapore has organised more than 170 outgoing missions for close to 700 Singapore-based companies to help them internationalise their business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also gained an early foothold in India. In 1992, Ascendas opened its IT park in Bangalore,&nbsp;right after India embarked on economic reforms in 1991. Since then, Singapore developers have established more IT parks in various parts of India. Progressively, we strengthened our G-to-G engagements, cemented by the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).&nbsp;This has received a boost through the Trade-in-Goods Agreement under the ASEAN-India Free Trade Area (AIFTA) that came into force this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting&nbsp;a mutual desire to strengthen and also to deepen our bilateral economic ties, a second review of CECA will be launched later this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Within ASEAN, my&nbsp;Minister earlier pointed to the benefits of increased integration.&nbsp; Bilaterally, we have also made steady progress in our economic engagement efforts. In Vietnam, for example, we embarked on a joint Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Park (VSIP) in 1996.&nbsp; Today, we are already into our fourth VSIP project.&nbsp; More importantly, we have moved up the value chain, from developing industrial parks to integrated township developments. These projects have also facilitated our companies' ventures. For example, coffee processor Gold Roast leverages on its premises in the second VSIP to now process and also export Vietnamese coffee beans to the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Asian economic landscape evolves, we need to deepen our knowledge on the emerging opportunities. IE Singapore and EDB will continue to support Singapore companies, and engage Asian businesses to promote greater bilateral trade and investments. To this end, IE Singapore and EDB will also consider expanding their ground presence in key emerging regions, such as cities in central China.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.30 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More global companies will seek to penetrate emerging markets in Asia.&nbsp; At the same time, Asian enterprises' ambitions to expand their international reach will also grow.&nbsp; So with our established hub status, efficient and business-friendly environment, strong financial sector and comprehensive FTAs with key markets, Singapore offers a compelling&nbsp;value proposition as a dual-purpose gateway for companies \"seeking Asia\" and for companies&nbsp;\"going global\".</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an indicator, we have managed to attract nearly 3,000 Chinese companies here. &nbsp;One of them, AAC Acoustic Technologies Holdings Inc., a China-based global leader in miniature acoustic components, set up its regional headquarters and R&amp;D centre in Singapore&nbsp;in 2009.&nbsp; This regional headquarters is to coordinate its global expansion and also to enhance product development capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Asia, our economic agencies will also help companies explore opportunities in other fast growing or emerging markets such as the Middle East and Latin America.&nbsp; Developments in these countries create demand in various sectors such as infrastructure projects, transportation and logistics services, urban solutions, lifestyle and consumer products, which can benefit many of our local companies and&nbsp;SMEs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to touch on an issue closer to home.&nbsp; I would like to thank Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang for their active roles in championing consumer protection, and for their feedback and concerns.&nbsp; CASE's active role in consumer education forms the basic level of our consumer protection framework, and we are supportive of CASE's work and efforts.&nbsp; In fact, we have significantly increased our funding by about 30% to CASE since 2008, and we continue to be open to providing more resources for new educational programmes for the vulnerable, which has been highlighted by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, which cannot be reached by CASE's current efforts.&nbsp; Secondly, the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act has provisions for civil remedies, with appropriate and practical channels for redress and compensation. This will apply to sub-standard gold jewellery and timeshare sales raised by both MPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the mandatory cooling-off period for timeshare sales has been extended from three to five days to address pressure selling, while a 60-day refund period was also added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Consumer&nbsp;Protection&nbsp;(Trade Descriptions&nbsp;and&nbsp;Safety Requirements) Act is a criminal law carrying a fine and imprisonment term.&nbsp; This Act is reserved for false trade descriptions with clear criminal intent and harm, and for unsafe products.&nbsp; While it is not practical to screen all the products upfront, this Act nonetheless empowers SPRING to screen higher-risk products such as electrical and gas appliances prior to sale.&nbsp; Our product safety framework will also be enhanced to make it easier and faster for SPRING to recall unsafe products.&nbsp; For the incident of toy safety issue mentioned by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, SPRING has identified the distributor of the toys.&nbsp;This distributor has recalled the toys from the market.&nbsp; SPRING has also visited island-wide 109 shops, push carts, stalls in 16 major shopping areas and found that four of them are selling those toys.&nbsp; These four shops have been asked to stop selling the toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked for the status of the Lemon Law so MTI has been working on this matter.&nbsp; As the Lemon Law is quite a complex issue cutting across many sectors, careful steps must be taken to ensure a balance and effective legislation is put in place to safeguard the interests of consumers and businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;So MTI is currently studying the necessary legislative changes and will complete the public consultations on these proposed changes by this year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Chairman, I think when the ESC Sub-Committee made the recommendation, it is not with a view to any particular country being a source. But, clearly, to some extent, the limits of technology and infrastructure would suggest that the most obvious sources would be in our neighbourhood. Today, we import our natural gas from our immediate neighbours.&nbsp;Any sourcing of electricity that can go beyond that would help us&nbsp;in terms of our&nbsp;diversification objective.&nbsp;But, at the same time, I want to make the point that if we were not importing gas but importing electricity from a neighbour, the overall risk to us as a system, in my view, remains the same, with the exception of the connectivity issues.&nbsp;But&nbsp;beyond that, I think&nbsp;the key point&nbsp;is really that there is no fixed idea of where we can import the electricity from but, in principle,&nbsp;it is an&nbsp;idea which we should consider.&nbsp;Therefore, naturally the corollary is that we cannot really say for sure which way the price would go, whether it would be higher or lower.&nbsp;But, clearly, if it were to add value to our system, then it would only make sense if a proposal were to be put forward by a private operator or an entity,&nbsp;that it should be able to price electricity competitively in the context of our system; otherwise it would not make sense.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And finally, pricing policy and whether this augurs a higher share of energy in a household budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I think it is hard to predict this.&nbsp; If you had asked me the question last year, I would say, well, it is&nbsp;actually going to be a lower percentage because fuel and oil prices went down.&nbsp; And that is precisely the point:&nbsp; there is a lot of volatility; we cannot tell for sure which way it will go in the short term.&nbsp;But the long-term trend, in terms of energy&nbsp;vis-&agrave;-vis other product groups, tends to be relatively higher.&nbsp; And that is something that we should accept. The sooner we recognise it and undertake fundamental measures to mitigate through competition and other efforts and, where necessary, intervene in a targeted way to help, the sooner we have a system that is clear and unambiguous in its intent, I think the better we will be, whether it is households or as an economy.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, three clarifications.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp;the Minister of State&nbsp;on Social Enterprise (SE).&nbsp;I think&nbsp;he mentioned that City College was successful in getting the LETA Scheme, and I am very happy about that. But may I ask whether City College is the only SE that qualified because as far as I know, they took at least between one-and-a-half to two years before they managed to get the paperworks through and qualify for the LETA Scheme. And I suspect that part of it is because of the inherent differences in the organisation's core structure of SEs that makes it very difficult to qualify for it.&nbsp; So would the MOS look into the intricacies of the grants and the schemes available to make them more friendly and more suitable to MPOs like SEs?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second clarification:&nbsp;MOS has not really replied to my query on whether we could have a strategy of putting SEs and SMEs together in the cluster hunting overseas because they can add to the competitive edge, as I mentioned in the speech itself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the third clarification:&nbsp;EDB has a special International Organisation (IO) team&nbsp;that was set up to attract IOs to Singapore quite successfully.

I do not see how this cannot be doable. But, in practice,&nbsp;it is hard for Singapore companies with complementary strengths to come together and address overseas market opportunities.&nbsp; What IE has been doing is to create the iPartners programme under which about 50 consortiums were formed&nbsp;&ndash; encouraging companies of different sizes, following a lead company, to address a specific opportunity.&nbsp; Like the CSR, I think we can encourage but I do not think we can mandate such a relationship to happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third point about whether SPRING can follow EDB's model in the developing the SE sector here, SPRING and MTI's primary objective is still to create jobs through economic activities.&nbsp; To that extent, if SEs qualify,&nbsp;we will support it.&nbsp; If we change this focus, I think it will be wrong for MTI.&nbsp; Having said that, it does not mean that SEs are&nbsp;not worth supporting.&nbsp; So, between MTI, SPRING and MCYS, I think we have got to find a way to support the SEs&nbsp;to the best of our ability.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Sir, the Minister mentioned about plans to attract medium enterprises to Singapore.&nbsp; Can the Minister elaborate a bit on the plans and also which economic agency will&nbsp;handle this task of bringing these companies to Singapore?\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> This will largely be done by EDB.&nbsp;The EDB has begun this effort beyond targeting the bigger multi-national companies.&nbsp; They are also looking at companies that are of some size which will be classified as SMEs by their home country, but fairly large by our standards.

Often, I meet residents who complain of high electricity bill.&nbsp; I talk to them and ask if they sleep with the air-conditioning turned on, and if they do, I&nbsp;suggest to them to turn it off at one or two o'clock.&nbsp; They tell me they cannot sleep.&nbsp; What can I do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that on 1st April 2001, the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources&nbsp;formed their National Energy Efficiency Committee&nbsp;(NEEC).&nbsp; With Singapore's plan to accede to the Kyoto Protocol in 2006, the NEEC has been expanded in scope to cover climate change issues&nbsp;and has been renamed the National Climate Change Committee (NCCC) to better reflect its expanded function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this juncture, I would like to ask&nbsp;whether Singapore has kept up with developed countries in&nbsp;the efficient use of energy.&nbsp; Have we got our citizens to adopt enough of the measures to ensure efficient and economic use of energy even as they rely&nbsp;more on modern appliances to&nbsp;make life comfortable?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the 2000 World Competitiveness Year Book complied by the World Economic Forum ranked Singapore 25th out of 45 countries behind most developed countries in energy&nbsp;intensity or the amount of commercial&nbsp;energy consumed&nbsp;per dollar of GDP.&nbsp; This could be attributed to the fact that Singapore is a tropical city state where unlike the higher ranked countries which have temperate climate, Singapore depends heavily on air-conditioning to cool its buildings all year round.&nbsp; In temperate countries, heating is usually used only in&nbsp;autumn and winter&nbsp;and air-conditioning in summer, only during very&nbsp;hot weather.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there is much that&nbsp;Singapore can and should do to improve its energy efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Efficient utilisation of&nbsp;energy will enhance our cost competitiveness bearing in mind that oil and&nbsp;gas prices will rise in the long run. In addition to this,&nbsp;with the growing international concern about carbon dioxide emission, Singapore will need to contain its carbon dioxide emission and comply with&nbsp;international obligations.&nbsp;The challenge will be to ensure economic growth while minimising the growth&nbsp;in energy demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, can the Minister share with the House on what more it plans to do to promote energy efficiency in Singapore?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Water resources</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, without a doubt, the Republic is envied by many developed cities in the world for being able to move from scarcity to sustainability with regards to its water supply.&nbsp; A little red dot that is not blessed with great lakes and limited land size to collect rainwater, it is certainly amazing that Singapore has a robust and diversified water supply from four different sources known as the four national taps&nbsp;&ndash; water from local catchment areas, imported water, reclaimed water known as NEWater and desalinated water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, if Singapore's breakthroughs in the areas of water technology,&nbsp;continued investment&nbsp;in research and development&nbsp;&ndash;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Time to stop.&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Global warming</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ang Mong Seng</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>): [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100308/20100308VS_172059.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I> *.] We all are feeling very hot and humid these days with the temperature rising up to 35-36 degrees.

Let me explain.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, Singaporeans use about 158 litres of water per person per day. &nbsp;Although we are on schedule to meet the target of per capita domestic consumption of 155 litres by 2012, why not set a challenge for Singaporeans to see if they can do with much less?&nbsp; Our&nbsp;domestic electricity consumption per person has declined in&nbsp;four consecutive years from 2005. Yet in countries like Hong Kong electricity consumption is much less&nbsp;&ndash; in 2006 this was some 30% less than Singapore&rsquo;s per capita consumption. &nbsp;Is there a possibility that Singaporeans can be encouraged to do with much less?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the climate talks around the world will continue but progress has been slow. On the ground, in our homes, I am sure that every one of us would like to make a difference.&nbsp; This is a practical and important way to educate Singaporeans about the possibilities of doing with less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PUB and Singapore Power have had education campaigns for years. &nbsp;Having a low rate special will give Singaporeans fresh impetus and a new sense of fun when saving water and electricity. These benchmarks are per capita based so even large households will benefit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, how do we price them?&nbsp; I suggest the Ministry follow a social pricing model &ndash; that is to say, for households who are needy and who would like very much to save on their utility bills, have a very low price for those who manage to stay significantly below national averages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a 4-room flat, the average electricity bill is $92 a month and for water, about $32.&nbsp; Therefore, their average utility bill without gas is $134.&nbsp; For those who are savvy consumers, their water&nbsp;and electricity bill can be under $100.&nbsp; And if we are very frugal and careful, if we consume less than 50% of what the national per capita consumption is, then I think the Public Utilities Board should reward us with a very low flat fee of about $50 for both electricity and water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.15 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I call this social pricing but, of course, I do not think that this should be means tested.

It was also supposed to agree on longer-term cooperative action on a range of issues including mitigation, adaptation, technology development and transfer and financial resources to support developing countries&rsquo; efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The end product of the high-powered and internationally charged event ended with a mere Accord which was promulgated as a compromise by a small number of countries behind closed doors. There was no unanimous consensus to that Accord internationally. Notwithstanding the disappointment, many concerned Singaporeans and I are proud of Singapore Government&rsquo;s commitment to do our part to save the Earth, even though we are only a small red dot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next COP-16 meeting in Mexico will be at the end of this year.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</B> <p>Mr Chairman, I wish to thank Mr Cedric Foo, our GPC chairman and Members for their questions and helpful suggestions.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo asked about Singapore's plans for sustainable development. Dr Fatimah and Ms Ellen Lee also asked about Singapore's position with regard to the Copenhagen Accord, arising from the recent Copenhagen Climate Change Conference.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Copenhagen Conference did not produce a legally binding agreement. However, countries agreed to continue the work through this year to the next Climate Change Conference in Mexico in December 2010. Countries also took note of the Copenhagen Accord, which outlines elements of a global framework on climate change, including long-term goals, mitigation of greenhouse gases by both developed and developing countries, financing, adaptation and technology transfer.</p>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Copenhagen, Singapore supported the Copenhagen Accord and has since written to the UNFCCC Secretariat to associate ourselves formally with the Accord as a good basis for advancing negotiations towards reaching a legally binding global agreement on climate change. Though the Accord, as it stands, does not create legal obligations, it contains important elements that can facilitate the ongoing negotiations. To date, about 100 out of the 194 Parties to the UNFCCC have associated themselves with the Accord. About 30 non-Annex I countries, including Singapore, have also tabled their emission reduction targets.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Countries will now need to work hard to reach a global agreement. Developed countries should take the lead by continuing to fulfil their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to substantially reduce their emissions. Developing countries too have a responsibility to play their part by taking actions to reduce their carbon emissions. Sir, I met the Mexican Environment Minister at the informal high-level Ministerial meeting on climate change in Bali recently and we had a good exchange on the way forward. I told him that Singapore stands ready to be a constructive player to help move the process towards a successful outcome in Mexico. The Mexican Minister shared his view that Singapore plays an important role in the negotiations and commended our domestic actions in the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint and our offer of 16%.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ellen Lee asked about ASEAN's effort on climate change. Climate change is a key issue for many ASEAN countries as we are vulnerable to the adverse impacts of global warming. In November 2007, ASEAN leaders endorsed the ASEAN Declaration on Environmental Sustainability, and committed to the goal of addressing climate change and preventing dangerous changes to the world&rsquo;s climate system. ASEAN Environment Ministers also established an ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change to enhance cooperation and collaboration.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, ASEAN members are part of the larger G77/China developing country group which has called for developed countries to contribute 0.5% to 1% of GDP to fund mitigation and adaptation. Developing countries, like Singapore, are not obliged to contribute but can help on a voluntary basis, for instance, through technical cooperation programmes. For example, through NEA&rsquo;s Singapore Environment Institute, we have conducted programmes for participants from developing countries on green energy and climate change.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has also contributed towards reducing carbon emissions arising from forest fires in the ASEAN region. We have collaborated closely with Indonesia, in particular Jambi Province, on fire prevention and suppression. These efforts are also important to our air quality. Singapore's air quality has been in the \"good\" range since the start of this year. Nonetheless, due to dry weather conditions, our air quality was recently slightly affected by bush fires in the northern and eastern parts of Singapore. I understand there were also bush fires in Johor. Our neighbours are doing their best to battle forest fires in their areas and we will continue to engage them through the Sub-regional Ministerial Steering Committee on Transboundary Haze Pollution. I also urge Singaporeans to dispose of their&nbsp;litter responsibly as carelessly discarded items like lit cigarette butts or matches could lead to bush fires.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to play our part in international efforts to mitigate climate change, Singapore has pledged to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 16% from the 2020 business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. This target is contingent on a legally binding global agreement in which all countries implement their commitments in good faith. Our target is credible and rigorous given our past efforts to reduce emissions and the constraints we face as a city-state, including our limited potential to adopt renewable energy. It is a substantial commitment by Singapore. Achieving it will involve considerable costs, and changes in lifestyle and business practices.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her speech at the opening session of the Copenhagen Conference, the COP-15 President, Danish Minister Connie Hedergaard, cited Singapore as one of the developing countries that announced national targets and commented that these were examples of \"ambitious national actions\" that developing countries could take in order to contribute towards the global mitigation effort. Singapore was commended in the EU statement at Copenhagen. Aside from the EU and the Mexicans, the Swiss, US and some of our ASEAN counterparts also told our delegation that Singapore's offer was appreciated.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the detailed emissions reduction measures for each sector are still being firmed up, I wish to assure Mr Seng Han Thong that our approach will be to phase in the measures gradually. The Government will also help cushion the impact and lighten the burden on households and businesses.<br>\r\n &nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key part of our strategy to achieve the 16% target is energy efficiency, and Singapore is implementing plans to improve energy efficiency, even while the international negotiations are ongoing. Members spoke about the importance of energy efficiency. This was also underscored by the Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) in its recommendations last month. Energy efficiency reduces costs, enhances energy security, and makes our economy more competitive. The ESC proposed that Singapore should be a Smart Energy Economy. This includes stepping up measures to promote energy efficiency across the key sectors.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April last year, we launched the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint which sets out Singapore&rsquo;s strategies to achieve a more vibrant economy and a more liveable environment for future decades. The blueprint is a comprehensive plan to improve resource efficiency, enhance our environment, grow capabilities and build a culture of environmental responsibility in Singapore. One of the targets under the blueprint is to reduce energy intensity by 35% from 2005 levels by 2030. Mr Foo mentioned that this is a long time span, and whether we have interim targets. The short answer is yes but these targets are being developed. To achieve this, the Government will play a key part and I will outline the measures being implemented in each sector.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of National Development shared during its COS debate that efforts are underway to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings, which account for more than one-third of national electricity consumption. Last year, BCA launched its second Green Building Masterplan which aims for 80% of our buildings to be green by 2030, and introduced a $100 million incentive scheme to encourage the retrofitting of existing buildings. BCA will increase the mandatory minimum energy efficiency standards for Green Mark certified new buildings by 10% from today&rsquo;s standards by the end of this year, and will also mandate the submission of building energy usage data from 2011.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transport is another sector which utilises a fair amount of energy. As public transport is the most efficient mode of transport, the Government set aside more than $40 billion to improve the public transport system to encourage more people to switch to public transport. To manage the use of private transport, the vehicle population growth rate was lowered to 1.5% last year and improvements to the off-peak car scheme were recently implemented. MOT and LTA will continue to assess other measures and implement them at an appropriate time.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is significant potential for industry, the largest energy consuming sector, to save energy and reduce costs by investing in energy efficiency. We have various incentives to encourage the adoption of energy efficient technologies and practices. For instance, the Grant for Energy Efficient Technologies (GREET) co-funds up to 50% of the cost of energy-efficient equipment. Funding of about $2.5 million has been approved for five projects which are estimated to result in annual energy savings of over $700,000. NEA also introduced the Singapore Certified Energy Manager Training Grant to co-fund the cost of energy management training.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>5.30 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Building on these efforts, we will take more robust measures to spur industries in Singapore to be leaders in energy efficiency. From experiences in other countries, the implementation of energy management programmes is one of the most cost-effective ways to improve energy efficiency. Studies indicate that a company can expect to reduce energy consumption by at least 10% to 15%, with many companies able to achieve even larger reductions. This is why some countries mandate energy management practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Denmark, energy-intensive companies have to pay higher energy taxes unless they put in place energy management systems, identify and implement energy efficiency improvement measures and submit annual reports on their progress. In Japan, Sir, industrial facilities are required to adopt energy management practices and have in place training for workers and processes to be more energy efficient. Similarly, Sir, we want our companies to have the right processes and people to ensure prudent use of energy.&nbsp; Some companies in Singapore already adopt a robust approach to managing their energy use. For instance, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme set the target of reducing energy use by 7% this year as part of its energy efficiency plan. Such practices ought to be the norm in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our consultations with large energy users indicate that a range of energy management practices exists today. We therefore see the need for minimum standards to ensure greater management attention is paid to energy. While this will ultimately benefit companies in terms of cost-savings, we also recognise the need to give companies sufficient lead-time to prepare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By&nbsp;2013,&nbsp;we&nbsp;will require companies in the industry sector consuming more than the equivalent of 15 GWh of energy each year to appoint an energy manager, monitor and report energy use to NEA,&nbsp;and develop and&nbsp;submit&nbsp;energy efficiency improvement plans. NEA will be consulting the companies involved on the detailed requirements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure a smooth transition, NEA&nbsp;will introduce the Energy Efficiency National Partnership (EENP) in April to help our companies build up the necessary capabilities before the mandatory energy management practices come into effect. We will also be reviewing our incentive schemes and exploring long-term energy efficiency financing options to cater to the needs of companies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These energy&nbsp;management requirements for industry and&nbsp;energy efficiency-related&nbsp;legislation in&nbsp;other sectors&nbsp;will be consolidated in an Energy Conservation Act that will come into force in 2013.&nbsp; The Act allows for a co-ordinated approach to standards-setting for energy efficiency across all sectors, and will represent a major milestone in the Government's efforts to develop energy efficiency as a competitive advantage for Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Seah Kian Peng suggested lower electricity and water charges for households that consume less than the norm. In Singapore, electricity and water are priced to reflect their full cost to send the right pricing signals to consumers&nbsp;and&nbsp;minimise wasteful consumption.&nbsp;Households that use these resources&nbsp;efficiently enjoy&nbsp;direct benefits by having smaller utility bills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue&nbsp;to&nbsp;raise the awareness&nbsp;of energy efficiency in&nbsp;our households.&nbsp; In April 2008,&nbsp;we introduced&nbsp;the 10%&nbsp;Energy&nbsp;Challenge&nbsp;to&nbsp;encourage&nbsp; households&nbsp;to adopt&nbsp;energy-saving habits.&nbsp; Household appliances such&nbsp;as refrigerators,&nbsp;air-conditioners&nbsp;and&nbsp;clothes dryers&nbsp;in stores now carry the mandatory&nbsp;energy&nbsp;label so that consumers have sufficient information to make energy efficient purchases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NEA&nbsp;also entered&nbsp;into a&nbsp;voluntary agreement with retailers&nbsp;and suppliers to promote&nbsp;energy efficient appliances.&nbsp;Signatories such as Best Denki and Harvey Norman are retiring their stock of energy inefficient models and introducing more three- and&nbsp;four-tick ones so that energy efficient models form a larger percentage of models on sale.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I announced last year, minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) will be implemented for household air-conditioners and refrigerators in 2011.&nbsp;MEPS will remove&nbsp;the&nbsp;most energy inefficient air-conditioners and&nbsp;refrigerators from&nbsp;the market. Depending on the appliance category, all zero-tick models and some one- and two-tick&nbsp;models&nbsp;will be&nbsp;removed,&nbsp;representing about&nbsp;20%&nbsp;of&nbsp; our&nbsp;current&nbsp;sales&nbsp;volumes. A sufficient range of brands and models will remain available for consumer choice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MEPS&nbsp;will&nbsp;help consumers to save on&nbsp;electricity bills and&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;expected&nbsp;to significantly&nbsp;increase&nbsp;the upfront cost&nbsp;of&nbsp;air-conditioners&nbsp;and refrigerators.&nbsp;A more efficient&nbsp; refrigerator that costs the&nbsp;same&nbsp;as&nbsp;one phased&nbsp;out by&nbsp; MEPS can&nbsp;save&nbsp;a household about $130 a year. When all the existing air-conditioners and refrigerators in Singapore comply with the MEPS standards, consumers will enjoy a total energy savings of about $20 million annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we&nbsp;will tighten the MEPS&nbsp;standards over time. We&nbsp;will also consider Mr Foo's suggestion of extending MEPS to more appliances, such as lighting and televisions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Seah asked about public sector's efforts to reduce carbon footprint. Improving energy efficiency is Singapore's strategy to mitigate climate change. Since 2007, all large public sector buildings have been required to conduct energy audits to identify areas where energy savings can be&nbsp;reaped.&nbsp; All&nbsp;public agencies&nbsp;are also to ensure that the ambient indoor air temperature of their premises is in the range of 22.5 to 25.5 degree Celsius, to maintain comfort without overcooling the premises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;as at end&nbsp;2009,&nbsp;12&nbsp;out of&nbsp;56 public sector buildings have completed&nbsp;their audits and&nbsp;implemented the recommendations,&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;about $3 million&nbsp; in total annual savings.&nbsp; A further $1.5 million in&nbsp;total annual&nbsp;savings&nbsp;could be&nbsp;realised&nbsp;when improvement works in the pipeline are completed. There will be more savings when the remaining buildings complete their audits by end FY2011.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major infrastructure facilities have also improved their energy efficiency. PUB is carrying out measures to reduce energy consumption at its installations by 10% in FY2010 compared&nbsp;to BAU&nbsp;projections.&nbsp; NEA's waste disposal facilities also implemented&nbsp;measures which reduced electricity&nbsp; consumption&nbsp;by&nbsp;about&nbsp;9%&nbsp;and achieved an average savings of over $3 million annually over the last&nbsp;10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I&nbsp; am also pleased&nbsp;to&nbsp;inform&nbsp;Mr Seah&nbsp;that&nbsp;NEA&nbsp;has been working with organising committees of national events such as the National Day Parade to help reduce the environmental&nbsp;impact&nbsp;of&nbsp;these&nbsp;events.&nbsp; NEA&nbsp;also developed a&nbsp;set&nbsp;of&nbsp;green event guidelines which are available on its website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the public sector will continue to take the lead on environmental sustainability measures.&nbsp; From FY2011, all Ministries will set energy-savings targets. We will continue to study new measures that can be implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ang Mong Seng asked if Singapore was prepared for climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007,&nbsp; the NEA&nbsp;commissioned&nbsp;a&nbsp;study involving local and&nbsp;foreign&nbsp; experts&nbsp;to understand our vulnerabilities to climate change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The first phase of the study covering the physical impacts of climate change has&nbsp;concluded.&nbsp; The results&nbsp;have&nbsp;been peer-reviewed&nbsp;by&nbsp;international experts&nbsp; who noted&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;study&nbsp;adopted&nbsp;well-established methodologies and that the findings are plausible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;study projects that the average daily temperature in Singapore could increase by between 2.7&nbsp;and 4.2 degree Celsius&nbsp;from&nbsp;the current average&nbsp;of&nbsp; 26.8 degree Celsius&nbsp;by&nbsp; 2100&nbsp;and the mean sea level around&nbsp;Singapore could&nbsp;rise by&nbsp;24&nbsp;to&nbsp;65 centimetres by&nbsp;2100.&nbsp; These findings&nbsp;are within&nbsp;the&nbsp;range of our expectations&nbsp;and&nbsp; consistent with global projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir,&nbsp;these&nbsp;findings are not the last word on&nbsp;this subject as climate&nbsp;science is a complex and evolving subject.&nbsp; We are not certain, for instance, about the impact of ice sheet melting.&nbsp;NEA will continue to keep abreast of&nbsp;developments in&nbsp;this area. We will improve our understanding as more information and data become available and climate change models become more robust.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of our long-term approach to infrastructure planning, we already have some&nbsp;measures in&nbsp;place which will help address the potential impacts of climate change.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp;PUB's&nbsp;current requirements for&nbsp;reclaimed&nbsp;land&nbsp;to&nbsp;be constructed to a platform level of 125 centimetres above the highest tide level should give us an adequate buffer against the projected sea level rise in the short to medium term. In addition, we are enhancing our response to the impact of floods by expanding our network of&nbsp;water level&nbsp;sensors,&nbsp;and&nbsp;we&nbsp;will be&nbsp;studying if our drainage design standards need to be revised to cater for heavier storms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, NEA&nbsp;has embarked&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;second phase of&nbsp;the Vulnerability Study to investigate in&nbsp;detail the&nbsp;impacts of&nbsp;climate change&nbsp;on&nbsp;public health,&nbsp;urban temperature and urban biodiversity. This will inform future adaptation measures that the Government&nbsp;will&nbsp;put&nbsp;in&nbsp;place to&nbsp;address the&nbsp;longer&nbsp;term&nbsp;impacts of&nbsp; climate change.&nbsp;MND leads an inter-agency Adaptation Taskforce to review the sufficiency of Singapore's existing adaptation measures&nbsp;and&nbsp;identify new&nbsp; measures&nbsp;as required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Masagos Zulkifli asked about our water supply and water demand. Like energy, water is a key resource and we will ensure that a&nbsp;sustainable supply continues to be in place to support our economic growth and population needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 2011, Singapore's water catchment area will increase to two-thirds of our&nbsp;land area with the completion of the Punggol and Serangoon reservoirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp; addition,&nbsp;Sir, when&nbsp;Changi&nbsp;NEWater&nbsp;factory&nbsp;is&nbsp;fully&nbsp;completed&nbsp;in&nbsp;2010, NEWater will be able to meet 30% of our current water needs. As a source which is independent&nbsp;of&nbsp;rainfall, NEWater enhances the&nbsp;resilience of our water supply by supplementing local water stocks in the event&nbsp;of&nbsp;extended&nbsp;dry spells, like what we are experiencing today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far during&nbsp;this current dry&nbsp;spell, we&nbsp;have&nbsp;managed&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep our reservoir levels high by tapping our NEWater and desalination capacity. However, increasing our water supply is only half the picture. The current dry and hot weather has seen Singaporeans using more water. To ensure a sustainable water supply for all, I urge everyone here to do our part and use water wisely.&nbsp; I have been told that it is raining in Woodlands. So the heavens have opened up but we must still continue to be frugal.&nbsp; It is also raining here outside Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;water pricing is an&nbsp;important&nbsp;element of our water&nbsp;conservation efforts. The price of water recovers the full costs of producing and supplying it, and also factors in the higher cost of additional water supplies. Thus, on top of the tariff for potable water, the Government levies a&nbsp;water conservation tax&nbsp;from&nbsp;the first drop.&nbsp; The volumetric structure of the water tariff and&nbsp;water&nbsp;conservation tax ensure that the less water you consume, the lower your water bills. Singaporeans therefore benefit directly in cost savings through the prudent use of our water resources.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singaporeans&nbsp;have been supportive of&nbsp;water conservation, enabling&nbsp;us to reduce per&nbsp;capita domestic&nbsp;water consumption&nbsp;from 165&nbsp;litres per day&nbsp;in&nbsp;2003 to 155 litres per day in 2009. We should not let up on our water conservation efforts as we work towards the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint target of 140 litres in 2030.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, to better understand the drivers behind water use, the PUB is conducting a water consumption lifestyle study, which is expected to be completed by end 2011. As part of&nbsp;the&nbsp;study,&nbsp;a&nbsp;survey&nbsp;was&nbsp;conducted&nbsp;to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;the&nbsp;public's&nbsp;attitude&nbsp;towards water&nbsp;conservation.&nbsp;It is encouraging that most respondents&nbsp;perceive water conservation to be important.&nbsp; Moving forward, the study will focus on finding ways to further promote water conservation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To&nbsp;help&nbsp;the non-domestic customers&nbsp;such&nbsp;as&nbsp;industries,&nbsp;hotels and&nbsp;schools to better manage their water use,&nbsp; PUB will work&nbsp;with them&nbsp;to&nbsp;prepare&nbsp;Water&nbsp; Efficiency Management Plans. These plans will include an&nbsp;analysis of&nbsp;their current&nbsp;water use, identify potential water saving measures and an implementation timeline. Sir, customers will be able to tap our existing Water Efficiency Fund to implement these measures if they meet the funding criteria.&nbsp; To-date,&nbsp;about 20 companies&nbsp;have submitted their plans, with water saving targets of up to 10%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with your indulgence, I will respond to Mr Zulkifli's query on ABC Waters and Mr Cedric Foo's query on Recycling later when I take Dr Lim Wee Kiak's cut.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Recycling and waste minimisation</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang):</B> Sir, being a small and compact urban city state, Singapore can be a model city nation to the world in the best practices in recycling and waste minimisation. We generate more than 5.6 tonnes of rubbish per day and that is 2,044 tonnes per year. With the opening of our integrated resorts and an expected huge influx of tourists, we can only expect our rubbish load to increase.&nbsp;With limited land for incineration and landfill, we have no choice but to recycle more and reduce waste.&nbsp;In 2008, we achieved a recycling rate of 56%. I understand that this rate has been going up.&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether&nbsp;we are&nbsp;on target of achieving 60% recycling rate by 2012.&nbsp;What is the Ministry&nbsp;doing now to encourage higher recycling rate by households?\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The \"Bring Your Own Bag\" (BYOB) campaign started off with a very good response&nbsp;two years ago. It started only with one Wednesday a month and it quickly caught on and soon we started&nbsp;on every Wednesday. However, the movement seems to have lost steam along the way and now we are hardly reminded at all about this campaign.&nbsp; I asked my daughter this morning when I was driving her to school about \"Bring Your Own Bag\".&nbsp; She asked me, \"What is that?\"&nbsp; What is the Ministry&nbsp;doing now to encourage Singaporeans to reduce the use of plastic bags? Will the BYOB movement be extended to more days of the week especially the weekends where crowds are at their greatest&nbsp;in their numbers?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to thank the Ministry&nbsp;on the pilot project to provide every block with a recycling bin at one of my precincts in Sembawang GRC. The preliminary results&nbsp;of the last two months have been very promising.&nbsp;I&nbsp;am pleased to say that out&nbsp;of the 14 blocks, the 14 bins have been full almost every week.&nbsp;And I hope that one day, every block of HDB flats will have a recycling facility.

If the collection company is too far away, it will not be cost effective for the small players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These recycled material collection companies need a more centralised location to perform collection and sorting. I understand that approved land and industrial property for such trades are in short supply. I know some companies currently at Defu Lane in Hougang are asked to vacate the premises. To move out of convenient locations like this means almost certain death for the trade and many will become unemployed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current land approved for the recycling industry are at remote areas like Tuas and&nbsp;Sarimbun Recycling Park.&nbsp; These areas are too far and more meant for factories processing the recycled material into useable form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, it seems that there is no holistic approach from various&nbsp;Government agencies such as NEA, PUB, HDB, etc, on the guideline to regulate the recycle collection industry. While NEA issues licence to the company, PUB will have another set of requirement due to concern of water pollution. Although these companies are prepared to invest to meet the required environmental standard, the uncertainty of land use makes it difficult for them to commit such an investment.&nbsp; I suggest the Government consider setting up a recycle \"Collection Hub\" perhaps&nbsp;at Lorong Halus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By better tapping on the SMEs other than just the Public Waste Collectors, the many hands approach can improve recycling outreach to help improve the overall recycling rate.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> <p>Mr Chairman, I thank the three speakers.&nbsp; Let me start&nbsp;with recycling and waste minimisation.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our overall recycling rate has increased from 40% in 2000 to 57% in 2009 and we are on track to meet the target of 60% by 2012.&nbsp;We are studying how we can enhance the effectiveness of our existing recycling efforts.&nbsp; For instance, there is scope to reduce the amount of domestic waste disposed&nbsp; and&nbsp; we&nbsp; are working&nbsp; with the public waste collectors to review the National Recycling Programme.&nbsp; This includes studying the provision of more recycling bins in HDB estates and the collection and recycling of other waste streams such as garden waste from landed homes and food waste from markets.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked about reducing plastic bag usage.&nbsp; Sir, we limit the environmental impact&nbsp; of&nbsp; disused plastic bags by incinerating them in our waste-to-energy incineration plants, rather than landfilling&nbsp; them.&nbsp; Many households also re-use plastic bags to bag their refuse.&nbsp;The focus of efforts like the \"Bring&nbsp; Your Own Bag Day\" was launched by the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) in April 2007 is therefore to discourage&nbsp; the&nbsp; excessive use of plastic bags via public education, and to foster a more conservation-oriented mindset.&nbsp; I&nbsp; understand that close to 300 retail outlets now participate in&nbsp; this&nbsp; effort.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think this is encouraging.&nbsp; I assure Dr Lim that NEA will continue with efforts to educate the public on the importance of recycling and waste minimisation as well as the proper use of recycling facilities.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support new waste minimisation and recycling projects, NEA launched an $8 million 3R&nbsp; Fund last year.&nbsp; To date,&nbsp; we have received 43 applications, of&nbsp; which nine were approved with grants amounting to $137,000, and 18 are still being evaluated. One of the applications approved is the&nbsp; National&nbsp; University&nbsp; of&nbsp; Singapore's&nbsp; Recycling Master Plan to improve the recycling infrastructure and&nbsp; enhance the 3R culture in the University.&nbsp; The project is expected to reduce or recycle 540 tons of waste over three years.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to reduce waste at source, NEA has collaborated with the food and beverage industry on the&nbsp; voluntary Singapore Packaging Agreement since July 2007.&nbsp; This Agreement demonstrates that&nbsp; environmentally&nbsp; friendly&nbsp; practices make sound business sense&nbsp;&ndash; the participating companies saved&nbsp; $4.4 million from a reduction of 2,500 tons of packaging waste over the last two years.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp; example, F&amp;N Coca-Cola you see on the screen shortened the neck closure and reduced the&nbsp; weight of their plastic bottles, saving about 200 tonnes of materials a year. Tetra Pak Jurong introduced&nbsp; a process to recover and reuse waste plastic packaging materials, saving about 380 tonnes of packaging&nbsp; a&nbsp; year.&nbsp;Following the extension of the Agreement to cover all types of product packaging since October 2009, we can expect to see avoided waste and reduced packaging in other sectors as well.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Low Thia Khiang asked how we are developing the recycling industry. Since 1995,&nbsp; land has been set aside for the recycling industry at the Sarimbun Recycling Park (SRP).&nbsp; The SRP is now fully leased out to 13 companies recycling waste items such as wood, horticultural waste, and construction and demolition&nbsp; waste.&nbsp; NEA is exploring other areas where recycling industries can be sited.&nbsp; Companies, in fact, can also apply to JTC for industrial land to set up recycling facilities.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low raised the question about some companies having to move out of Defu Lane. To the best of our knowledge, that has not happened.&nbsp;But housekeeping is now being enforced in the Defu industrial estate because now it is part of the Marina-Punggol Reservoir Water Catchment and therefore we have to ensure that the companies there meet environmental pollution standards.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, NEA also has various funding schemes to incentivise and develop the waste management and recycling&nbsp; industry.&nbsp; These schemes&nbsp; include&nbsp; the 3R Fund, which I touched on earlier, the Innovation for Environmental Sustainability Fund as well as the Environment Technology Research Programme.&nbsp; SPRING Singapore also has assistance schemes targeted at SMEs, including loan schemes and capability upgrading programmes.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo raised the possibility of introducing recycling chutes in HDB estates.&nbsp; Let me just give him an example.&nbsp;A trial was undertaken at Chua Chu Kang to retrofit and convert unused refuse chute into chute for recycles. And it shows that recycling participation rate of the households in the block increased from 67% in December 2006 to 93% in July 2007.&nbsp;Currently, several chutes for recyclables will also be provided at four new HDB blocks at Fernvale at Sengkang and at the new eco-precincts at Punggol and at the regenerated Dawson estate.&nbsp;We have looked at the first experience and we will implement this progressively to see whether it will help in terms of our recycling rate.&nbsp; The demonstration project at Chua Chu Kang proves it and that is why HDB is now considering it for some of the new estates.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to the question of our R&amp;D and manpower capabilities.&nbsp; Singapore's good track record in environment and water management puts us in a strong footing&nbsp; to develop new solutions&nbsp; that&nbsp; are&nbsp; exportable&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; world.&nbsp; I&nbsp; am pleased to inform Mdm Ho Geok Choo that we have been making good progress on this front.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; building&nbsp; new&nbsp; capabilities&nbsp; in&nbsp; sustainable&nbsp; water&nbsp; solutions for several years, supported by&nbsp; the&nbsp; Clean Water Programme launched in 2006 with $330 million in funding from the National Research Foundation (NRF). The Clean Water sector now contributes over&nbsp; $800 million&nbsp; in&nbsp; value add (VA)&nbsp; and&nbsp; supports about 9,000 jobs, and&nbsp; we are on track to meet our target of $1.7 billion in VA and 11,000 jobs in 2015.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, six research projects amounting to $13 million received funding from the Clean Water&nbsp; programme. Two of these projects focus on developing the next generation of water membranes&nbsp; by&nbsp; mimicking&nbsp;nature, for example, the mechanism utilised by mangroves to purify brackish water. These bio-mimetic membranes have the potential to significantly lower the energy used in water purification.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a vibrant community of R&amp;D centres in Singapore which also serve as manpower receptacles&nbsp; to&nbsp; train&nbsp; specialised&nbsp; R&amp;D manpower for the industry, a point raised by Mdm Ho. For example,&nbsp; the Singapore-Delft Water Alliance launched its Double M.Sc. Degree in Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources Engineering in 2009. This is a joint programme between NUS&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; Delft&nbsp; University&nbsp; of Technology, and provides&nbsp; an ideal platform for the students to draw from the expertise of both universities. Such programmes complement the existing courses offered by our Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), and together with our scholarships, ensure a pipeline of qualified manpower to support Singapore's water industry.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore&nbsp; is&nbsp; providing&nbsp; platforms&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; international&nbsp; sharing&nbsp; of&nbsp; ideas&nbsp; and best practices. Our second annual Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) was held in June 2009 and brought together more than 10,000 participants from over 80 countries. Looking ahead,&nbsp; SIWW 2010&nbsp; is set&nbsp; to be&nbsp; another&nbsp; milestone as Singapore will also be concurrently hosting&nbsp; the&nbsp; inaugural&nbsp; \"Asia&nbsp; Pacific Water Ministers Forum\", which will highlight&nbsp; the&nbsp; importance of good&nbsp; governance and solutions to water sustainability.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;for other efforts&nbsp;to grow the Clean Environment sector, the Jalan Bahar CleanTech Park is&nbsp; being&nbsp; jointly developed by JTC and EDB.&nbsp; The development of the Park will be carried out in three phases over 20 years with Phase 1 commencing in July 2010.&nbsp; NTU will be the first anchor tenant and will help to seed R&amp;D activities.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA&nbsp; also&nbsp; launched&nbsp; the&nbsp; $15 million&nbsp; Environment&nbsp; Technology Research Programme (ETRP) last&nbsp; year&nbsp; to&nbsp; focus&nbsp; on&nbsp; developing&nbsp; waste&nbsp; management&nbsp; solutions for Singapore&nbsp; which&nbsp; also&nbsp; have&nbsp; export&nbsp; potential.&nbsp; The&nbsp; first&nbsp; request-for-proposal (RFP) saw good response&nbsp; with&nbsp; 67&nbsp; proposals&nbsp; received.&nbsp; Many&nbsp; interesting&nbsp; ideas&nbsp; were raised.</p>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance,&nbsp; one&nbsp; proposal&nbsp; aims&nbsp; to&nbsp; reduce&nbsp; the&nbsp; time&nbsp; needed&nbsp; for&nbsp; landfill stabilisation from&nbsp; the&nbsp; existing&nbsp; norm&nbsp; of&nbsp; around&nbsp; 30&nbsp; to&nbsp; 40&nbsp; years,&nbsp; to between 10 and 15 years. This proposal and four others received a total ETRP funding of about $4.8 million. The second RFP was launched in January to fund research in improving the efficiency of incineration plants and extending the lifespan of the one and only landfill that we have in Singapore which is the Semakau Landfill. This attracted 27 proposals and the results will be announced in June.&nbsp;And Mdm Ho has asked about Semakau landfill.&nbsp; At the current rate of use, Semakau landfill is expected to last another 25 to 30 years. NEA is proceeding with plans to turn Semakau landfill into an eco-park to allow companies to conduct field testing of renewable and clean technologies, and is currently exploring possible pilot projects for implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.00 pm<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we&nbsp; are&nbsp; also&nbsp; working&nbsp; closely&nbsp; with&nbsp; the&nbsp; IHLs&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; agencies&nbsp; to&nbsp; build&nbsp; up Singapore's environment capabilities through research. As a start, NEA collaborated with NTU to secure $7 million from the NRF to develop sustainable urban waste management solutions.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;research aims to harness waste&nbsp;streams&nbsp;for energy production.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have made a good start in waste management research.

Constantly, they are worried about the possibility of their loved ones coming down with dengue.&nbsp; This prompted me to ponder over the dengue situation that has affected Singapore last year where there was, as I understand, a 26% increase in dengue cases in the first nine weeks of 2009 in comparison to the situation in the same period in 2008.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dengue fever is the most common mosquito-borne viral infection in the world and poses a serious public health threat to all of&nbsp;us in the Republic. The economic and social effects of dengue on households are significant and distressing.&nbsp;As we all know, if&nbsp;the head of your family gets infected, is unable to work and incurs medical cost, the spouse has to stay home for a while. Outstanding bills get piled up, kids get affected emotionally and sometimes, worst of all, someone passes away, that is, death comes a-knocking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of late, we have heard of the phrase encouraging productivity on the basis of cheaper, faster and better.&nbsp; I wonder if this endeavour can be applied to our mozzie busting efforts. Thus, can MEWR and NEA update us all on the dengue situation in 2009 so that the key lending points can be adapted and rolled out for implementation?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a better understanding of the key learning points from previous experiences on dengue control will ensure that the resources devoted to this cause will lead to effective operational policy approaches in keeping the dengue threat at bay.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Sustaining public cleanliness standards</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, after open-air concerts, public events and gatherings, the amounts of garbage left over pose hygiene problems.

Will penalties for littering be made heavier?\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, very often, discarded receptacles are not cleared. They collect water that could lead to mosquito breeding. Could MEWR update us on the dengue situation and what are the measures being taken to keep the dengue situation under control?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the issue of rubbish chutes in older housing estates needs urgent remedy.&nbsp; These flats were built over 30 years ago of which we have several blocks in Boon Lay. And they have rubbish chutes which get choked up on a daily basis due to the constricted structure of the chutes. The stench and the sight just churn your stomachs. Contractors clear the choke by hacking the walls outside the chutes. But this may cause potential structural problems and it does not solve the problem. Is it possible to install rubbish compactors in households?&nbsp; If it is too costly, we can have rubbish compactors for common use on each floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty years ago, when I visited Norway, rubbish compactors were installed in every household. Rubbish compactors will help to reduce the collection of bulky items thrown down the chutes.

Foreign workers who&nbsp;gather at parks, void decks and other areas often leave behind an unsightly mess of beer bottles and leftover food. Every weekend, we see large crowds of foreign workers gathering at various places, like Little India.&nbsp; I have been informed by NEA that on a typical weekend night, more than 15,000 foreign workers could congregate in Little India. After a Saturday night, Little India is strewn with so much rubbish everywhere that people have to be careful where they step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 2008 article in the <I>New Paper</I> on littering by foreign workers described little India as \"Litter India\".&nbsp; Action must be taken to tackle the problem of littering which is a public health hazard.&nbsp; The efforts of NEA to educate foreign workers against littering have not gone unnoticed.&nbsp; However, education to change the littering habit of foreign workers will take time and has a limited effect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To overcome the littering problem, we cannot rely on education alone.&nbsp;Enforcement is necessary.&nbsp; I would like to ask how many littering tickets are issued on a typical Saturday and Sunday for littering in Little India.&nbsp; Looking at the mess that is left behind, I assume that it will be very easy to catch litterbugs there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the methods of enforcement?&nbsp; And are there more efficient ways of apprehending errant litterbugs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA raised the composition fine for first-time minor littering offenders from $200 to $300 last year.&nbsp; I would like to ask: can and do the foreign workers that have been caught littering pay up this fine?&nbsp; Besides fines, are there other punitive measures that can deter foreign workers from littering? Are there any other measures besides education and enforcement being planned?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One initiative by NEA to control the littering in Little India was to increase the numbers of bins in Little India. As beer bottles, liquor bottles and empty food containers take up a lot of space and can fill up a bin within minutes,&nbsp;should the bins be larger, greater in numbers and cleared more frequently during the weekends so that the foreign workers have no excuse to litter?&nbsp; I hope that the NEA will find creative solutions to keep Singapore clean. This will certainly help to ease the brewing unhappiness of locals with foreign workers in Singapore.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Littering and noise pollution</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan:</B> Sir, early in January 2010, it was reported in the <I>Straits Times</I> that an average of 700 tickets were issued every month for littering in the parks. For the whole of 2009, more than 8,300 summonses were issued by NParks' enforcement officers.&nbsp; The situation is not better in the HDB heartlands.&nbsp; When we visit the HDB blocks in the morning, they are clean because of the town councils' cleaners.&nbsp; If we visit the same blocks later in the evening, they are dirty due to indiscriminate littering by either residents or visitors.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this situation is not acceptable. We have to take more steps to educate our residents and the users of our national parks that littering is an anti-social behaviour and must be discouraged.&nbsp; Everyone must have a responsibility to ensure that Singapore remains litter-free so that we can have a clean and beautiful environment that we can call \"home\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask the Minister what is MEWR's strategy to manage this littering problem?&nbsp; Does the Minister think that an anti-littering campaign or&nbsp;a \"Keep Singapore Clean\" campaign will help remind residents on the importance of not littering?&nbsp; Or for that matter, in November, instead of planting trees, can we then go on an anti-littering sweep-up of the estate? Would the Minister consider imposing a corrective work order on a first-time offender?&nbsp; Instead of a fine, the offender is involved in cleaning up the litter which he had contributed to. On the part of NEA, could the agency also take more steps to ensure that its cleaning contractors carry out their cleaning activities more regularly especially in the private estates?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, on the issue of noise pollution. During my house visits, I have frequently received feedback or complaints about noise coming from construction sites late at night. The noise from the construction sites disturbs the peace and tranquillity of the estate and residents are forced to keep their windows closed so as to alleviate the noise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, noise in the middle of the night tends to be exaggerated because there is less ambience noise in the surrounding.&nbsp; My residents complained that the movement of prime movers or the movement of cranes sound noisier late at night. Construction workers talking loudly during the wee hours of the morning also sound louder and more irritating. Some residents have even resorted to installing noise measuring instruments to prove that the noise created by these construction companies exceeds the limit allowed by NEA.&nbsp; May I know what is MEWR's approach to the noise pollution?&nbsp; Would MEWR consider restricting all construction works in residential areas after, say, 10 pm or not later than 12 midnight?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what about noise or loud music created by entertainment outlets located near residential areas late in the night? For these entertainment outlets, could there also be stringent enforcement to ensure that they are kept within the noise limit?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Noise pollution</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Sir, construction projects are a sign of progress and renewal.&nbsp; They are a welcomed sight.&nbsp; However, in a small country like us, they inevitably&nbsp;caused inconvenience. The issue is how to balance different interests and whether we have got the balance right.&nbsp; I ask the Minister to review the balance where the issue of noise is concerned.&nbsp; I have raised this issue before but complaints from my residents compel another try.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an important issue as it affects our well-being.&nbsp; International organisations, such as the WHO, have highlighted the negative effects of noise on the physical, psychological and social functions of people.&nbsp; Currently, the environmental projection and management regulations set out the noise levels permitted at different areas. Their levels vary according to time, place and duration. The current regulations permit construction work to be carried out near housing estates on Sundays.&nbsp; It only provides for very slight adjustments in terms of timing and noise levels. For example, Part II of the Second Schedule states, \"that the maximum permissible noise level between 7 am and 7 pm for construction sites affecting residential buildings located less than 150 metres away from the site is 75 decibels. From 7 pm to 10 pm, the contractor is allowed 55 decibels.\"&nbsp; In both cases, there is only a 15 decibel reduction from that allowed from Mondays to Saturdays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, more importantly, construction work does not progress at this steady hum.&nbsp; There will be instances where their work, over from time to time, exceeds the limit but not breaches the regulations because it is not sustained. This is of little comfort to those who have had their rest disturbed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I make this plea for peace and quiet one day a week.&nbsp; I propose that construction activities near housing estates should cease or at least be heavily restricted on Sundays.&nbsp; Sir, Sundays are important time for recreation for most people.&nbsp; It may be the only time of the week that they get to rest at home or spend quality time with their families.&nbsp; Yet, the current law allows construction work to begin as early as 7 am on Sunday mornings and for construction work to continue throughout the day.&nbsp; This is not the case in some other developed countries. For example, in the United Kingdom, several town councils, including the city of London, prohibit construction work on Sundays and bank holidays.&nbsp; New York city goes further. The New York City Noise Control Code provides that construction activities can only take place on weekdays between 7 am and 6 pm. These cities recognise that managing areas of high human density requires special rules.&nbsp; Is there any reason why rules in Singapore are different?&nbsp; The inevitable argument is that such rules will delay projects and increase costs.&nbsp; However, has such a study been done to determine the extent of the increase?&nbsp; Are developers suggesting that such rules will not make development commercially viable?&nbsp; It is difficult to believe that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any event, can the developers not work smarter and conduct other kinds of activities on Sundays?&nbsp; Is this not a situation where we are leaning too much in favour of corporate interest?&nbsp; I therefore ask the Minister to review the rules on noise.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Food hygiene</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa:</B> Sir, I felt the need&nbsp;to re-visit the issue of food hygiene at public places such as hawker centres and coffeeshops as there is already no room for complacency.

Last&nbsp; year,&nbsp; NEA&nbsp; successfully&nbsp; hosted&nbsp; the&nbsp; first&nbsp; Asia-Pacific&nbsp; Dengue&nbsp;Workshop&nbsp; for government officials from 28 countries.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although&nbsp; we&nbsp; had&nbsp; a&nbsp; good&nbsp; year&nbsp; in&nbsp; 2009,&nbsp; our&nbsp; fight&nbsp; against&nbsp; vector-borne diseases&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; continuing&nbsp; one&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; public&nbsp; has&nbsp; a&nbsp; key&nbsp; role&nbsp; to&nbsp; play.&nbsp; We&nbsp; must continue&nbsp; to&nbsp; take&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; and&nbsp; ensure&nbsp; that&nbsp; our&nbsp; living&nbsp; environment&nbsp; is&nbsp; free from&nbsp;mosquito&nbsp; breeding.&nbsp;We&nbsp;cannot afford to be&nbsp;complacent&nbsp; because&nbsp; any&nbsp; lapse&nbsp; will give dengue the chance to harm us and our loved ones, as Mr Masagos&nbsp;Zulkifli has alluded to earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, several&nbsp; Members, Mdm Ho Geok Choo, Mr Ong Kian Min and Mr Lim Biow Chuan&nbsp;asked&nbsp; about&nbsp; efforts&nbsp; to&nbsp; sustain&nbsp; public&nbsp; cleanliness&nbsp; and deter&nbsp; littering.&nbsp;NEA&nbsp; adopts&nbsp; an&nbsp; integrated&nbsp; approach,&nbsp; comprising&nbsp; an&nbsp; effective cleaning regime, outreach programmes for the community, strict enforcement and penalties to deter litterbugs. Notwithstanding this, littering remains a concern.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA&nbsp; increased&nbsp; enforcement&nbsp; from&nbsp; 54&nbsp; man-hours&nbsp; per&nbsp; day&nbsp; in&nbsp; 2006&nbsp; to&nbsp; 442 man-hours&nbsp; per&nbsp; day&nbsp; last&nbsp; year.&nbsp; This&nbsp; resulted&nbsp; in&nbsp; an&nbsp; increase&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; number&nbsp; of littering offenders&nbsp; caught from&nbsp; about 7,000&nbsp; in&nbsp; 2006&nbsp; to close to&nbsp; 41,400 last&nbsp; year. We also increased the penalty for first-time littering offenders from $200 to $300 last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min asked about the effectiveness of enforcement in Little India. As he pointed out, NEA has stepped up enforcement and education efforts targeted at foreign workers.&nbsp; Since the presence of enforcement officers also deters potential litter-bugs, the effectiveness of these efforts should not just be measured based on the number of tickets issued.&nbsp; I also wish to take this opportunity to point out that the majority of litter-bugs caught&nbsp;&ndash; over 70% last year&nbsp;&ndash; are locals.&nbsp;Littering is not a problem&nbsp; caused&nbsp; primarily&nbsp; by&nbsp; foreign&nbsp; workers. We&nbsp; will&nbsp; continue&nbsp; to&nbsp; focus&nbsp; our enforcement&nbsp; efforts&nbsp; on&nbsp; littering&nbsp; hotspots&nbsp; for&nbsp; maximum&nbsp; effectiveness.&nbsp;However, relying&nbsp; on&nbsp; enforcement&nbsp; alone&nbsp; is&nbsp; not&nbsp; sustainable,&nbsp; because&nbsp; it&nbsp; is&nbsp; highly&nbsp; resource-intensive. There is also a limit to increasing the frequency of cleaning, which NEA is already doing in areas with high human traffic and litter, such as Orchard Road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA therefore commissioned a&nbsp;sociological&nbsp; study&nbsp; to&nbsp; deepen&nbsp; our understanding of why people litter. Preliminary findings suggest that people litter because they perceive it as &ldquo;harmless&rdquo;, or are too lazy to walk to the nearest bin. When the study is&nbsp;completed,&nbsp;NEA&nbsp;will&nbsp;use the&nbsp;findings to fine-tune&nbsp;its programmes&nbsp;against&nbsp; littering.&nbsp;For a&nbsp;start, we will&nbsp;review the number&nbsp;and placement of litter bins in public areas and the effectiveness of our anti-littering messages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA is also proceeding with other measures to improve public cleanliness. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;mentioned,&nbsp;an&nbsp;effective&nbsp;cleaning regime is part&nbsp;of&nbsp;our&nbsp;strategy. NEA will introduce&nbsp;a&nbsp;voluntary&nbsp;accreditation&nbsp;scheme&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; cleaning&nbsp; industry. This is aimed at both&nbsp; raising&nbsp; cleaning&nbsp; standards&nbsp; and&nbsp; helping&nbsp; us to upgrade&nbsp; the professionalism and&nbsp;productivity of the&nbsp;industry, in&nbsp;line with&nbsp;the national&nbsp; efforts to boost&nbsp;productivity.&nbsp;NEA is&nbsp;consulting&nbsp;the&nbsp;cleaning&nbsp; industry&nbsp;on&nbsp; the&nbsp;proposed scheme&nbsp;and&nbsp;expects to&nbsp;complete&nbsp;consultations&nbsp;by the&nbsp;end&nbsp;of&nbsp; the&nbsp; year. We will encourage Government agencies to engage accredited cleaning companies when the&nbsp; scheme is&nbsp;rolled&nbsp;out.&nbsp;NEA&nbsp;will&nbsp; also&nbsp;study&nbsp; whether&nbsp;to introduce&nbsp;compulsory licensing for the cleaning industry in the longer term.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintaining a high standard of cleanliness and hygiene requires the efforts of&nbsp; all&nbsp; stakeholders. NEA&nbsp; is&nbsp;therefore studying the feasibility&nbsp;of establishing&nbsp;a Public Hygiene Council, with representatives from the people, private and public sectors. The aim is for the Council to support the Government&rsquo;s efforts to improve the consistency&nbsp; of standards&nbsp; in&nbsp; the cleaning&nbsp; industry,&nbsp; promote the&nbsp; improvement of hygiene standards in the community and recognise and share best practices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our&nbsp; long-term&nbsp; goal&nbsp; is&nbsp; to&nbsp;build&nbsp; greater community&nbsp; ownership&nbsp; of&nbsp; the environment&nbsp; so&nbsp; that&nbsp; people&nbsp; will&nbsp; not&nbsp; litter,&nbsp; even&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; absence&nbsp; of&nbsp; enforcement. This is the only sustainable way for us to keep Singapore clean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another note, Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked if we would launch another anti-littering campaign. Let me say that indeed NEA is looking into launching a new anti-littering campaign in 2010, focus on action-oriented initiatives, such as getting the NGOs and community to do clean-up activities within the neighbourhood. NEA&nbsp; currently&nbsp; issues&nbsp; licences&nbsp; for&nbsp; street&nbsp; hawking&nbsp; from&nbsp; fixed&nbsp; locations, subject to the approval of the relevant Town Council or land agency. However, as tissue paper peddling is a very uncertain livelihood, we encourage elderly folk in need of financial assistance to instead&nbsp;tap on the employment and social&nbsp;assistance schemes which MCYS and the Community Development&nbsp;Councils (CDCs) have in place.&nbsp;When&nbsp; NEA officers come across such elderly persons in need of assistance, they refer them to the CDCs for follow-up. I would therefore like to urge Mr Ang and other Members of this House&nbsp;as well as members of the public to do the same, that is refer them to the CDCs.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, Mr&nbsp;Hri Kumar&nbsp;and Mr Lim Biow&nbsp;Chuan asked about construction noise. NEA, as we all know,&nbsp;prescribes noise limits for construction sites, which vary according to the time of the day and by the types of premises nearby. Under the current limits, only quiet activities&nbsp;like&nbsp;painting&nbsp; and plastering&nbsp; are&nbsp; allowed&nbsp; at construction&nbsp; sites near residential areas after 10.00 pm. And Mr Lim Biow Chuan is smiling. [<I>Laughter</I>].\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; current&nbsp; construction&nbsp; noise&nbsp; limits&nbsp; already&nbsp; protect&nbsp; residents&nbsp; from&nbsp; any adverse health impacts. However, Sir, we note that construction noise, especially on Sundays and Public Holidays, remains a concern to many residents, including myself. In 2008 and 2009,&nbsp; NEA&nbsp; received&nbsp; about 14,000 and 12,000 complaints on construction&nbsp; noise respectively, up from about 9,000 in 2007 and 6,000 in 2006.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA consulted&nbsp;the industry&nbsp;and&nbsp;other&nbsp;stakeholders&nbsp;on measures&nbsp;to minimise construction&nbsp;noise&nbsp; nuisance,&nbsp;while&nbsp;allowing&nbsp;construction&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep&nbsp; pace with development. Following&nbsp;these discussions, our long-term&nbsp;goal is&nbsp;to prohibit construction&nbsp;work at&nbsp;sites within&nbsp;150 metres of&nbsp; residential&nbsp;areas&nbsp;and&nbsp;noise sensitive developments on Sundays and Public Holidays. We will implement the changes progressively to give the construction industry sufficient time to adjust.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sites starting work from 1st September&nbsp;this year&nbsp;will not be allowed to carry out construction activities from 10 pm on the night before a Sunday or a Public Holiday to 10 am on the day itself.&nbsp;NEA will extend this prohibition to the rest of the day on Sundays and Public Holidays for sites starting work from 1st September 2011.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, NEA&nbsp; is&nbsp; also&nbsp; tightening&nbsp; the&nbsp; noise&nbsp; standards&nbsp; for&nbsp; new&nbsp; and&nbsp; in-use&nbsp; vehicles. The&nbsp; revised&nbsp; standards&nbsp; for&nbsp; new&nbsp; vehicles,&nbsp; which&nbsp; are&nbsp; based&nbsp; on&nbsp; those&nbsp; currently implemented&nbsp; in&nbsp; Japan&nbsp; and&nbsp; the&nbsp; EU,&nbsp; will&nbsp; take&nbsp; effect&nbsp; from&nbsp; 1st&nbsp; October&nbsp; 2010.&nbsp; NEA&rsquo;s consultation&nbsp; with&nbsp; motor&nbsp; traders&nbsp; indicates&nbsp; that&nbsp; there&nbsp; will&nbsp; be&nbsp; no&nbsp; significant&nbsp; impact on&nbsp; the&nbsp; availability&nbsp; of&nbsp; vehicle&nbsp; models&nbsp; as&nbsp; new&nbsp; vehicles&nbsp; currently&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; market already&nbsp; comply&nbsp; with&nbsp; these&nbsp; standards. The&nbsp; revised&nbsp; standards&nbsp; for&nbsp; in-use&nbsp; vehicles will&nbsp; ensure&nbsp; that&nbsp; the&nbsp; exhaust&nbsp; systems&nbsp; on&nbsp; these&nbsp; vehicles&nbsp; continue&nbsp; to&nbsp; be&nbsp; well-maintained throughout their lifespan and will be effective from 1st&nbsp;April 2011.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about noise from entertainment outlets.&nbsp;The Police currently&nbsp;regulate&nbsp;the&nbsp; provision&nbsp; of&nbsp; public&nbsp;entertainment&nbsp;at entertainment outlets such as pubs, bars, KTVs and nightspots. These outlets are subject to&nbsp;licensing conditions, including&nbsp; limits&nbsp;on noise.&nbsp;In&nbsp;cases where persistent noise complaints are received, the&nbsp;Police work&nbsp;with&nbsp; NEA to&nbsp;conduct noise measurements and will impose penalties such as fines and demerit points if noise levels exceed the allowable limits.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore&nbsp; is&nbsp; a&nbsp; highly&nbsp; urbanised city&nbsp; with&nbsp; vibrant&nbsp; economic&nbsp; activities, so noise nuisances cannot be avoided completely. My Ministry will continue to work with&nbsp; key&nbsp; stakeholders&nbsp; to&nbsp; regularly&nbsp; review&nbsp; the&nbsp; management&nbsp; of&nbsp; noise,&nbsp; taking&nbsp; into account public feedback and international best practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to the issue of food hygiene. NEA&nbsp; has&nbsp;a&nbsp;comprehensive regime to&nbsp;regulate&nbsp; food hygiene standards&nbsp; in Singapore. As a result, the annual incidence of food poisoning outbreaks is low, with&nbsp; an&nbsp; average&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;four&nbsp; incidents&nbsp; per 1,000 food retail outlets&nbsp;between&nbsp;2006&nbsp;and 2009. Notwithstanding this, as Mr Liang Eng Hwa pointed out, we must continue to strengthen the regime.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last&nbsp; year,&nbsp; the&nbsp; number&nbsp; of&nbsp; tickets&nbsp; issued&nbsp; for&nbsp; food&nbsp; hygiene-related&nbsp; offences was 2,650. This was about 14% lower than the 3,080 issued in 2008, but higher than the 2,212 tickets issued in 2007. Since January, NEA has been beefing up the number of food hygiene inspectors. We aim to improve the ratio of inspectors to food establishments&nbsp;from&nbsp;the current one&nbsp;per&nbsp;800 to&nbsp;one per 400&nbsp;outlets.&nbsp;The&nbsp;additional manpower will enable us to carry out more frequent inspections, which together with efforts by&nbsp; licensees&nbsp; and&nbsp; food&nbsp;handlers&nbsp; will&nbsp; help&nbsp; ensure good&nbsp; hygiene standards are observed at foodstalls and foodshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also&nbsp; taken a&nbsp; serious&nbsp; view&nbsp; of the&nbsp; administrative lapses&nbsp; involving the&nbsp; delays&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; grading&nbsp;of&nbsp;foodstalls, which&nbsp; surfaced&nbsp; following&nbsp; the&nbsp; Geylang Serai&nbsp; food&nbsp; poisoning&nbsp; incident.&nbsp;NEA&nbsp; has&nbsp; since&nbsp; tightened&nbsp; its&nbsp; internal&nbsp; system&nbsp; to ensure that gradings are done in a timely manner and there are no delays in the issuing&nbsp;of&nbsp;grading&nbsp;decals. NEA&rsquo;s management&nbsp;has&nbsp;also reprimanded&nbsp;officers responsible for not carrying out the gradings on time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are tightening the penalty regime. From April this year, NEA will raise the minimum&nbsp;composition sum for food&nbsp; hygiene offences from&nbsp; $100 to&nbsp;between $200 and $400, depending on the severity of the offence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Licensees&nbsp; of&nbsp; food&nbsp; establishments&nbsp;are&nbsp;currently issued&nbsp;demerit&nbsp;points for public&nbsp;health&nbsp; lapses,&nbsp; and&nbsp; will&nbsp; have&nbsp; their&nbsp; licences&nbsp; suspended&nbsp; or&nbsp; revoked&nbsp; if&nbsp; they accumulate&nbsp;12&nbsp;or&nbsp;more demerit&nbsp; points&nbsp; within&nbsp; 12&nbsp; months.&nbsp;As&nbsp;an&nbsp;additional measure,&nbsp;NEA&nbsp; will&nbsp;require&nbsp;food&nbsp;handlers&nbsp;working&nbsp;for licensees&nbsp; suspended from 1st&nbsp; April&nbsp; 2010&nbsp; to re-take&nbsp; and&nbsp; pass&nbsp; the&nbsp; Basic&nbsp;Food&nbsp;Hygiene&nbsp; Course&nbsp; before&nbsp; they can resume practice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp; would&nbsp; also&nbsp; like&nbsp; operators&nbsp; of&nbsp; food&nbsp; establishments&nbsp; to&nbsp; place&nbsp; greater emphasis on the overall hygiene standards of their premises. NEA is introducing a Points Demerit System (PDS) for the main licensees of canteens, coffeeshops and food courts. Licensees who chalk up 24 demerit points for cleanliness-related offences within 12 months will be required to suspend their operation for up to&nbsp;three days&nbsp; to&nbsp; carry&nbsp; out&nbsp; thorough&nbsp; cleaning&nbsp; of&nbsp; their&nbsp; premises. The&nbsp; PDS&nbsp; will&nbsp; be implemented by the end of this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp; for&nbsp; hawker&nbsp; centres,&nbsp; stallholders&nbsp; are&nbsp; currently&nbsp; required&nbsp; to&nbsp; conduct quarterly spring-cleaning of their centres.

So far, projects at Kolam Ayer, Bedok Reservoir, and the first phase of MacRitchie Reservoir have been completed.&nbsp;For the second&nbsp;phase of&nbsp;MacRitchie&nbsp;Reservoir,&nbsp;visitors&nbsp;can now expect a new food and beverage outlet and improvements to the bandstand and footpaths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Works have also begun to transform the concrete canal along Bishan Park into a natural, meandering river that is seamlessly integrated into the park. Other interesting features include a water playground and a river promenade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, by the end of this year, we can look forward to the completion of another&nbsp;seven projects&nbsp; at&nbsp; Lower&nbsp; Seletar,&nbsp; Sungei&nbsp; Punggol,&nbsp; Pandan&nbsp; Reservoir,&nbsp; Jurong&nbsp; Lake, Sungei Whampoa, Sungei Kallang and Pang Sua Diversion Canal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Marina&nbsp; Reservoir&nbsp; hosted&nbsp; some&nbsp; 30&nbsp; events&nbsp; in&nbsp; 2009,&nbsp; including&nbsp; the&nbsp; National Day Parade. Later this year, it will be one of the competition venues for the Youth Olympic Games.&nbsp; The PUB will continue to work&nbsp; with the STB and URA to bring in more exciting events and introduce more recreational water activities such as rowing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, Sir, looking&nbsp;beyond&nbsp;our&nbsp;reservoirs, the PUB launched the ABC&nbsp;Waters&nbsp;Design Guidelines last year to encourage developers to integrate innovative waterscapes into&nbsp;their developments.&nbsp; These&nbsp; features&nbsp;such&nbsp;as&nbsp;rain gardens,&nbsp;bio-retention swales, and wetlands act as natural purification systems to remove pollutants and improve&nbsp;water&nbsp;quality,&nbsp;while enhancing&nbsp;the aesthetics and biodiversity&nbsp;of&nbsp;our landscape.&nbsp; So far, more than 10 projects have been initiated.&nbsp; The&nbsp;PUB also intends to launch&nbsp;a&nbsp; certification&nbsp;programme later&nbsp;this year to recognise&nbsp;organisations that incorporate ABC Waters elements into their developments.&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;it is heartening to see that the ABC Waters Programme has been well-received&nbsp; so&nbsp; far,&nbsp; with&nbsp; many&nbsp;community events held&nbsp;at the&nbsp;completed&nbsp;sites. &nbsp;As PUB continues to implement more&nbsp;projects&nbsp; island-wide,&nbsp;we hope to&nbsp;encourage Singaporeans to get closer to and interact with water and, in the process, develop a sense of ownership towards our water resources and help to keep them clean.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have a&nbsp; shared responsibility to ensure&nbsp;sustainable&nbsp;development.&nbsp; The Sustainable&nbsp;Singapore&nbsp; Blueprint&nbsp;highlighted&nbsp;the&nbsp;need to&nbsp;build a culture&nbsp;of environmental responsibility in Singapore. I notice Ms Sylvia Lim smiled when my Senior Parliamentary Secretary Amy Khor mentioned about the sociological study on littering, I hope she supports that.&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I am encouraged to see that there are already&nbsp;efforts&nbsp;by&nbsp; some groups to&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;the&nbsp;community&nbsp;to take&nbsp;ownership and do their part for the environment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance, more than 6,000 residents in the South East District took part in quizzes on&nbsp;energy&nbsp; conservation in&nbsp;exchange for energy-saving light bulbs for needy households.&nbsp; In the North West District, a programme to educate residents on&nbsp;energy-saving&nbsp;habits related to computer usage is&nbsp;being rolled&nbsp;out&nbsp;to&nbsp; some 196,000 households and 70 schools.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;our&nbsp;youths&nbsp;are also playing&nbsp;an active role.&nbsp;The&nbsp;National&nbsp;Youth Achievement Award Council has built up a strong network of NYAA Gold Award Holders' Alumni, many of whom are involved in efforts to encourage other youths to look after the environment. Many&nbsp;youth&nbsp;and&nbsp;visitors&nbsp;will&nbsp;be gathering&nbsp;in Singapore for the Youth Olympic Games this August. The organisers of the Games have taken pains to&nbsp; green the game&nbsp;venues.&nbsp;NTU's green club,&nbsp; Earthlink, also plans to engage the athletes on issues such as climate change and biodiversity in collaboration with UNEP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our attitudes and actions will determine a sustainable future for Singapore. Let&nbsp; us&nbsp; start&nbsp; doing&nbsp; our part now&nbsp;to&nbsp;grow&nbsp;our&nbsp;economy&nbsp;sustainably and&nbsp;keep Singapore clean and green.&nbsp;Together, we can ensure Singapore remains a lively and liveable city for our children and generations to come.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Chairman</B>: We have some time for clarifications.&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, in the earlier answer to my cut, the Minister said that land is allocated at Sarimbun Recycling Park.&nbsp; Would the Minister not agree with me that the land allocated at Sarimbun Park, first of all, is remote?&nbsp; Secondly, the nature of the trade which I mentioned, basically the&nbsp;<I>karang guni&nbsp;</I> who&nbsp;do collection, sorting and packing, is quite different from the recycling factory that is set up there.&nbsp;Therefore, would he not agree that this company, with the nature of the trade, would need a different kind of allocation of land, and the location of the land is important because of the nature of the trade?&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second clarification, Sir. I would like to ask the Minister, since the Ministry has to do with sustainable environmental development and in which recycling is a main programme of the Ministry, would he not appreciate and recognise the efforts of these <I>karang guni</I> traders, who have played an important part, I believe, and also in the chain of the recycling industry since many years ago?&nbsp; If so, would the Ministry, in appreciation of them, have some programmes of funding to upgrade the industry and make the industry more productive?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the third clarification is whether the Minister is aware that such <I>karang guni</I> trade, though it does not look like a proper trade, has actually helped&nbsp;many people to survive, in terms of giving some financial help to them on their own effort. I am sure many people will notice that there are a lot of senior citizens who go to the hawker centres to collect cans as their past time, and at the same time they have some income.&nbsp; So the industry is actually serving quite a lot of people, and it serves a purpose of financial help&nbsp;on their own effort. I believe that it deserves the Minister's attention to see how he can improve and upgrade the trade by giving them some incentives to improve.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir, on the issue of location, as I mentioned in my reply, Sarimbun is actually fully leased out. So location is not an issue to the industry. They have been able to locate themselves in Sarimbun and operate quite effectively.&nbsp;At the moment, because there is a lack of space in Sarimbun, we are exploring with JTC and other Government land authorities to explore other options.&nbsp; In fact, companies at the moment, as mentioned in my reply, can write directly to the various Government agencies to get industrial land for that purpose.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of the <I>karang guni</I> men, I think we have to look at our recycling programme in its overall structure.&nbsp;We do have companies that collect waste, which are licensed by the Government and, therefore, we integrated the recycling programme with the waste collection companies so that they can do these things better. It does not mean there is no role for what you called the <I>karang guni</I> men.&nbsp; In fact, we have been told that some companies do work together with some of these operators.&nbsp; I am not sure whether the <I>karang guni</I> men are licensed, to begin with.&nbsp;If they are licensed, therefore, the appropriate industry sector will probably have to be addressed in terms of how to improve their productivity.&nbsp; They are definitely not licensed by NEA or MEWR.&nbsp;But the point is, we leave it to the industry to sort out on how best&nbsp;they can work together to achieve our goal.&nbsp;In terms of the waste collectors, because we licensed them and we have a plan where Singapore is broken up into nine sectors to ensure that there is sufficient coverage of waste collectors who can also do recycling.&nbsp; In the case of the <I>karang guni</I> men, for example, would they be prepared to do recycling&nbsp;from HDB flats, which is very tedious and very onerous?&nbsp; But the waste collecting companies are obligated to do so to provide a scheme to collect recyclables from HDB flats.&nbsp;As you know, it is very tedious to go house to house, door to door, floor to floor, to collect the recyclables, but our waste companies are doing that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, from the Government's point of view, we have to find an efficient overall recycling structure that can meet our needs.&nbsp; At the moment, the National Recycling Programme (NRP), which involves our waste collection companies, they&nbsp;are doing the job of collecting recyclables. But we are reviewing that and we are open to any suggestions on how best we can improve that.&nbsp; It is up to the industry to sort out how best they make use of the current existing players. If the <I>karang guni</I> men want to work together with some of the waste collection companies, which they can do, there is nothing to prevent them from doing so.&nbsp;In our case, under the NRP, the waste collection companies are obligated to collect the recyclables from households&nbsp;on specific dates, either the first&nbsp;Monday or first&nbsp;Thursday of every&nbsp;two weeks or whatever, is left to them.&nbsp; &nbsp;And as I said the programme has worked, but I mentioned in my reply that there&nbsp;is room for us to improve in terms of some waste streams such as food waste.&nbsp; So we are looking into that.&nbsp;My response to Mr Low is that I think it is best for the industry to sort out itself and if there are ways in which the existing players are prepared to work with new players such as the waste collection companies,&nbsp;we should leave to the industry to sort that out.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Three clarifications: one, could the Minister update us on the prognosis for dengue fever or the dengue situation in 2010?&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second clarification: I had asked the question about the rubbish compacter because I still have a problem with the rubbish chutes in Boon Lay.&nbsp;As I said, it is a structural problem and one way to actually clear this issue of bulky recyclable materials disposal is really to look into some compacters to be installed, maybe in every household.&nbsp; If we cannot afford that,&nbsp;maybe on every floor?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the third question I really have is with regard to the co-funding incentive, which Town Councils have, on employing dedicated personnel or the use of operations to control the dengue situation.

HDB will need to work with the Town Councils because this is really a question of infrastructure.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the dengue situation, I am pleased to inform the House that the dengue incidence in the first two months of this year was 35% lower than that in the same period last year.&nbsp;But notwithstanding this, we need to continue to be watchful this year for several reasons, two of which are, firstly, the expected warmer ambient temperature due to the return of the El Nino effect.&nbsp;This may increase the rate of dengue transmission as mosquitoes reproduce faster and the dengue virus replicates faster and remains infective for a longer period of time.&nbsp;So, if the dry spell continues the impact would possibly be double-edged &ndash; increased local transmission and increased importation of viruses if we are not careful, and if we do not remain vigilant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly,&nbsp;the&nbsp;risk of a switch in predominant circulating serotype.&nbsp;Historically, the predominant circulating dengue sereotype switches every two or three years and such switches are often associated with an increased intensity of&nbsp;outbreaks. So, we are currently into our fourth year with Dengue II as the predominant serotype and the probability of&nbsp;a switch taking place is growing.&nbsp;Any switch in predominant serotype this year may see more outbreaks occurring again if we are not vigilant. To mitigate this risk, NEA has embarked on a island-wide source reduction exercise earlier this year.&nbsp; NEA will also alert the public of the start of the traditional season for dengue transmission.&nbsp;We would also like to urge everyone to maintain high vigilance and continue to play their part to keep their homes and premises, offices, work sites and so on, mosquito-free. Get rid of potential mosquito breeding sites as a source reduction,&nbsp;ie, removal of stagnant water, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there is another question on co-funding of PCOs &ndash; the dedicated pest control operators for Town Councils.&nbsp; I think the dedicated pest control regime for all the 14 PAP Town Councils has worked very well and NEA is looking into the possibility and feasibility of extending this funding.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>6.45 pm</p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak:</B> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether the 60% recycling rate by 2012 is achievable.&nbsp;And what are we doing now to achieve that?

But at the same time, for domestic waste, there is still&nbsp;some room for improvement.&nbsp;What we are doing now is that we are reviewing the National Recycling Programme (NRP), together with the waste collectors, on how best we can&nbsp;increase the number.&nbsp;There are some suggestions that we are now working through internally before we consult the industry and the waste collectors on what more they can do.&nbsp; We are looking into the number of bins, the frequency of collection, etc. There are some cost implications obviously but this&nbsp;is something which we have to study very carefully because we have to be mindful of the potential impact on the industry in order to improve on our recycling of waste.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I want to assure Dr Lim that we are working on this target.

In some other cities,&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;there are laws to mandate food recycling in some outlets.&nbsp;We have studied across many different types of cities, from Tokyo to Melbourne, to London, and see what are the best practices we can adapt to Singapore.&nbsp; So, in fact, some of the things that we are doing now are not new.

Singapore achieves world-class results,&nbsp;thanks to a bold, unconventional synthesis of liberal and conservative approaches.&nbsp; The island's real ideology is pragmatic problem-solving.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, Singapore's healthcare system has been rated by the World Health Organization as the best in Asia and the sixth best in the world in year 2000.&nbsp; Our 3Ms, namely, Medisave, MediShield and Medifund, as well as our 3Es framework, namely, Eldersave, ElderShield and ElderFund, have ensured that our healthcare services remain affordable and that no Singaporeans will be deprived of the medical care that he or she needs.&nbsp; However, while Singaporeans enjoy a world-class healthcare system, we should not rest on our laurels, as there are still many areas that require further improvement.&nbsp; Our healthcare system must continue to evolve with the times to stay relevant to the changing needs of Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, what constitutes an ideal healthcare system?&nbsp; In my opinion, the characteristics of an ideal healthcare system can be illustrated by the acronym SAFE&nbsp;&ndash; S for Seamless, A for Affordable,&nbsp;F for Fast and E for Efficient.&nbsp; When all the key qualities are achieved, the result is a safe and high quality healthcare system for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; Much has been debated in the past about affordability and the provision of timely, quality medical services.&nbsp; I would like to take this opportunity to discuss how we can work towards propelling our healthcare system to the next level of excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recipe for a seamless healthcare system will include the following ingredients:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) information technology (IT) infrastructural support;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) physical infrastructural development;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) building our medical manpower resources; and last but not least</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) patient responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, IT infrastructural support.&nbsp;Imagine walking into any healthcare institution in Singapore, whether it is a public or private hospital, polyclinic or GP clinic, step-down care or nursing home, pharmacy or blood test laboratory.&nbsp;Your entire medical history, from the time you are born till you reach a ripe old age, is available to any healthcare provider, with just a push of the button or just reading the microchip in a national medical identity card.&nbsp; The cornerstone of&nbsp; a seamless healthcare is an efficient, effective IT infrastructure.&nbsp;There should be a national healthcare IT network to integrate all healthcare entities in the country.&nbsp;Beyond just simple connectivity, it demands a system that inter-operates seamlessly to reduce duplication, errors, waiting times and management overhead or costs, resulting in cheaper, safe and faster healthcare services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, physical infrastructural development.&nbsp; The provision of physical healthcare infrastructure, such as hospitals, step-down care, nursing homes and primary healthcare facilities must be adequate to meet&nbsp; the increasing demand from the increased population and ageing population.&nbsp; The recent newspaper reports of shortages of hospital beds, patients waiting for prolonged periods at the Emergency Department before admission and the \"alleged\" premature discharge of unwell patients from hospital to free up beds are consequences of the inadequacy of healthcare infrastructure and, to a certain extent, a mismatch in the demand and the provision of medical services.&nbsp; We can have the best surgeons, best physicians, best nurses and the most conducive clinics.&nbsp; But if patients are made to wait long hours to be admitted, with long periods for their medical records to be traced and investigations repeated due to lack of integration with other healthcare entities, the whole patient experience of a seamless and efficient healthcare system will not be realised.&nbsp; Without meeting the basic infrastructural requirements of a world-class healthcare system, we can never attain the goal of achieving a seamless healthcare system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the infrastructural development in the next 5-10 years, and whether these facilities will be able to cope with the increasing population, both residents, non-residents as well as medical tourists in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, building our medical manpower resources.&nbsp; The health workforce faces the challenges of a greying population as well as new technologies, lifestyle medicine and higher expectation, and demand for good medical care.&nbsp; There are shortages of healthcare providers in certain medical disciplines that will have to be filled.&nbsp;At the same time, the growth of the private sector may lead to higher attrition from the public sector.&nbsp;High quality care will be delivered by healthcare professionals who are trained in a holistic way to meet the standards of care in a changing, more sophisticated population.&nbsp;The challenge is to ensure adequate numbers of such healthcare professionals trained in different disciplines, especially in those healthcare disciplines that are currently under-subscribed, such as geriatric medicine, occupational speech and physiotherapy, just to name a few.&nbsp; Can the Minister elaborate on the Ministry's medical manpower build-up strategy to cope with the current shortfall and to address our long-term needs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, patient responsibility.&nbsp; The patient forms an important part of the equation of achieving a seamless healthcare system.&nbsp;Patients must actively manage their own health, taking personal responsibility in staying healthy by exercising and watching their diet.&nbsp;Each Singaporean should also have a family physician to look after his physical and mental health.&nbsp; It is through self-discipline and responsibility that wastages can be minimised, and the limited healthcare resources be channelled to areas which need it most.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister for an update on the Ministry's \"One Singaporean, One Family Physician, One Electronic Medical Record\" strategic thrust?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I am glad that the MOH has already taken steps to make our healthcare system more integrated and seamless through the Electronic Medical Records Exchange (EMRX) initiative, and the new regional cluster model where regional hospitals will be given more autonomy in day-to-day operations, manage polyclinics and their own network of general practitioners and&nbsp;a step-down care facility in their respective zones.&nbsp; However, more must be done to further integrate the public and the private healthcare sectors.&nbsp; I am sure, with determination and visionary leadership, Singapore can strive to have the best healthcare system in the world.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Three issues of concern in healthcare today are, first, disproportionate focus on specialists and&nbsp;hospital centrism; second, fragmentation and lack of coordination to make a seamless system; and, thirdly, rising healthcare cost.&nbsp; These can cause the system to be viewed as sources of inefficiency and inequality.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the future, the healthcare system must be able to respond faster and better to challenges of a changing world.&nbsp; This calls for, firstly, the need to strengthen and enhance our primary healthcare with greater empowerment of family practitioners.&nbsp; This will involve more training, skills upgrading, change of mindset and a more collaborative partnership of family practitioners in the regional healthcare cluster that&nbsp;we are forming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, ensuring sustainable and suitable healthcare insurance for every family based on needs, income, etc.&nbsp; MOH will have to assist with monitoring, recommendations and&nbsp;public education as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, keeping healthcare at affordable cost through surveillance and regulation of commercialisation as well as the factors that interplay both public and private.&nbsp; What steps will MOH embark on to meet these expectations and demand for healthcare of our future?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Healthcare manpower</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second cut is on healthcare manpower.&nbsp;Trained and skilled manpower is a precious commodity to a country like Singapore. With increasing workload in the public sector, staff continue to be lost to the private sector, overseas institutions and other non-healthcare related areas.&nbsp; We have a first-world healthcare infrastructure and we also need to meet first-world manpower standard.&nbsp; Eventually, they will have effect on efficiency and affordability.&nbsp; What are our plans in terms of meeting our manpower needs for the future?</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Policy matter</em></p>\r\n</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, Singapore has a world-class healthcare system, and our policies have served us well all these years.&nbsp; However, going forward, we need to continually tweak them so as to cater to the growing needs and expectations of our people.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, healthcare affordability has been a major concern for many Singaporeans, and this concern will perpetuate because of expected escalation of healthcare costs in lieu of advances in medical technology and of increasing numbers of aged folk.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister for Health whether Singapore's national healthcare expenditure, at the current level of health care servicing, will escalate quickly, and how will this affect patients in sharing healthcare costs?&nbsp; As our national healthcare expenditure proportion is borne two-thirds by the people (or the private share) and one-third by the Government, will this situation be sustainable in the long run?&nbsp; How will this impact the people, especially the low and middle-income Singaporeans, in view of the continuing escalation of healthcare costs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our 3M system will need continual review to accommodate the longer lifespan of people in an ageing population.&nbsp;Public education on our 3M system will address the concern of many on the affordability of healthcare.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister whether there is a plan to increase the take-up rate of MediShield and Eldershield further?&nbsp; How adequate is Eldershield in serving its intended purpose in terms of its accessibility, quantum and tenure of payout?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is understandable that in any ageing population, many more people in our population will worry about their own health.&nbsp; Many, especially those near or in the silver generation, feel that they may not only be unwanted but, more importantly, that there may be inadequate facilities to help care for their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I ask MOH what are its proactive plans in meeting the new challenges of a ballooning demand for healthcare services due to the increasing life expectancy of people and the ageing population?

What is the progress made for seamless step-down care to alleviate the expanding need and dependence on acute hospital beds?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is a need for improvement in the coordination and implementation of our various healthcare services, especially in integrated discharged hospital services to community-care and nursing homes.&nbsp; How are we doing presently in this area, especially in affordable step-down care beds?&nbsp; Are we on target with expansion of such step-down care services and on our medical staff requirement in general?&nbsp; Is geriatric medicine being prioritised presently?&nbsp; And are there adequate affordable ambulance services?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, elderly care is more than just about health promotion and the prevention and treatment of diseases and disability in the elderly.&nbsp; Elderly care is complex and needs a multi-disciplinary approach to ensure adequate care.&nbsp; Dementia and depression are on the increase.&nbsp; Distress arising from having to care for their elderly sick at home with challenging resources is common too.&nbsp; In this regard, it may be helpful for our Government agencies to consider the social issues involved and to provide training and support for home-care providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, it is important for our Government to periodically inform our people on the work we have done in preparing for the onslaught of a greying population, so as to allay people's concerns in this area.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
