Yes, we are being featured more positively as a city that swings and winning the bid for the Youth Olympic Games will be good for us.&nbsp; If Singapore wants to be a global city, it must behave like a global city and strive to make it more conducive for a spontaneous and expressive society, not because we want to read more positive stories in the foreign media about Singapore's image, so that Singaporeans can meaningfully identify beyond monetary terms with the notion of belonging to a First World nation.&nbsp; We can do this by actively nurturing our arts and culture.&nbsp; We should do this by expanding<p align=left>Column: 1131 </p> the space for public expression and activity.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this House heard last year about how the Workers' Party's cycling event was banned and the debate that ensued on political events.&nbsp; As Nominated MP, I do not propose to join that fray.&nbsp; I want to take this issue beyond party politics because there is such a wide scope for public expression.&nbsp; Last year, for example, a group of Singaporeans turned up with anime figurines at a public park to protest against the clamp down on online downloading by Singapore animation distributor, Odex.&nbsp; The Police sent four anti-riot vans to the scene, took down the anime fans' particulars and filmed them.&nbsp; It is not an issue of whether we should disapprove of copyright infringement or not.&nbsp; If the Government wants to rebuke criticisms that Singapore is not a police state, actions like these do not help.&nbsp; We can all appreciate concerns about law and order.&nbsp; Race and religion are still sensitive subjects.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I wonder if the Home Affairs Ministry can appreciate that there is a wide scope of issues for which more space to public expression can be given.&nbsp; It is not space for space sake.&nbsp; We strive to make Singapore a magnet for talent, a top economy, as we should.&nbsp; But let us not forget what the State does can leave an indelible intangible mark on an educated citizenry.&nbsp; We are losing about 800 to 1,000 Singaporeans a year.&nbsp; Would a better balance between law and order and a demonstrable regard for the importance of social expression have made a difference for them, not for all definitely, but for some?&nbsp; I am sure&nbsp;if every Singaporean counts, it should be enough to warrant relooking how we approach public expression.&nbsp; We need to learn how to cultivate the value of social expression, in particular by Singaporeans on Singaporean issues, to the benefit of the country.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1132 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Reports of harassments have been widely covered in the media.&nbsp; Of concern are the innocent victims of such harassments.&nbsp; Most of us, if not all of us, in this House would have encountered at some time or other during our meet-the-people sessions of residents telling us the problem they face from harassment from loansharks.&nbsp; Woe befalls anyone who had bought a resale flat whose previous owner had borrowed money from these loansharks.&nbsp; If the previous owner had outstanding debts, the loansharks' runners are indifferent to whether the new owners have anything to do with the previous occupant.&nbsp; Spray painting on the walls is a form of vandalism, and some even had the gall to cut off the electricity supply of \"lenders\".&nbsp; Some have even resorted to harassing neighbours or occupants of those flats to embarrass them into paying.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke with a Singapore PR who came from Hong Kong.&nbsp; I asked him, \"Do you have this problem in Hong Kong?\"&nbsp; He said, \"Oh, maybe the Hong Kong loansharks are more <I>kiasu</I> than the Singapore ones.\"&nbsp; I asked him, \"Why do you say that?\"&nbsp; He said that when the loansharks lend them the money, they actually do due diligence.&nbsp; I asked him what he meant.&nbsp; He said they went to<p align=left>Column: 1134 </p> verify where they live so that&nbsp;they would not have these innocent parties suffering.&nbsp; I do not know.&nbsp; It is quite laughable.&nbsp; But to these residents who come to see us at our MPS, it is not funny at all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I am glad that the Government has gone out in the media to show the plight, pain and suffering of gambling addicts' families in the effort to bring awareness to our people, the other end of the gambling problem, ie, that of the loansharks, is still very much in our midst.&nbsp; As long as there are borrowers, loansharks and their illegal moneylending activities will exist.&nbsp; However, their debt recovery methods have caused much stress, fear and tension not only to the occupants of the targeted flats but to the neighbours as well.&nbsp; I ask for a stronger enforcement and whether&nbsp;the current law is adequate enough to deal with this menace.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In January last year, Senior Minister of State, Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee, informed that there were 10,221 reported cases of unlicensed moneylending in 2006.&nbsp; That was a 19% increase over 2005 when there were 8,568 reported cases.&nbsp; Similarly, the 2005 figure represented an increase of 47%, to be exact, over 2004, which had 5,809 reported cases.&nbsp; Multiple initiatives were introduced by MHA to try to solve the problem.&nbsp; These included:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Enhancing the penalties under the Moneylenders' Act; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; The formation of the Anti-UML Task Force to increase, among others, the number of ambush operations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1135 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, recent figures show that these measures have not deterred UML syndicates.&nbsp; A look at the statistics for 2007 support this point.&nbsp; In 2007, there were 277 arrests over the first three quarters, ie, from January to September, which were just 17 short of the total number of arrests for the whole of 2006.&nbsp; All else being equal, working from an average of 30 cases per month, the total figure for 2007 would be in the region of about 360.&nbsp; In the same nine months in 2007, there were 7,438 reported cases of illegal moneylending and related activities.&nbsp; All else being equal, working from an average of 826 cases per month, the total figure for 2007 would be in the region of 9,917 cases.&nbsp; This is a mere drop of about 300 reported cases from 2006-07.&nbsp; Having previously worked with enforcement agencies to tackle similar types of crime, I put on record my appreciation for their dedicated effort in their attempt to deter UML activities in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in the light of the unattractive figures quoted above, I urge MHA to take a different strategy in tackling the very real problem of unlicensed moneylending.&nbsp; This involves simultaneously tackling the supply of and the demand for illegal loans.&nbsp; Currently, the law, called the Moneylenders Act, curbs UML only by deterring the supply of illegal loans into the market.&nbsp; It does nothing to penalise or deter the borrowing, ie, the demand side.&nbsp; This is clear from sections 8(1)(b) and (c) of the Moneylenders Act.&nbsp; These offences in these sections do not deter the demand for illegal loans.&nbsp; I therefore propose that MHA consider introducing a new section which makes it an offence if a person secures a loan for himself or on behalf of any other person from an unlicensed moneylender.&nbsp; The punitive measures which come along with the offence can be calculated based on the harm that the State deems such borrowing creates and based on the level that will best deter such activities.&nbsp; Naturally, the Public<p align=left>Column: 1136 </p> Prosecutor will have the ultimate discretion whether to prosecute a borrower, and unique circumstances prompting a compassionate approach would likely merit non-prosecution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said this, the merit of making borrowing illegal and having it in the books, as it were, is that it deters people from taking loans which cause both them and their neighbours a great deal of distress.&nbsp; Taking a page out of the speeches of Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Arthur Fong, to my mind, a good example, though not the only example, of a borrower who deserves to be prosecuted is one who gives a false address to the loansharks such that innocent residents get harassed.&nbsp; If the borrower abets such harassment, why not make his very act of borrowing an offence?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two prominent pieces of legislation which combat both the supply and demand elements of an offence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA).&nbsp; Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the MDA penalise the trafficking, import and export and manufacture of controlled drugs, ie, the supply of them.&nbsp; But, significantly, section 8 of the MDA also penalises the possession and consumption of controlled drugs, ie, the demand for them.&nbsp; By penalising both the demand and supply, Singapore's drug problem has been contained.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second prominent piece of legislation is the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA).&nbsp; Section 5(a) of the PCA penalises the supply of corruption, ie, it <p align=left>Column: 1137 </p>penalises, subject to other elements being satisfied, the corrupt soliciting or receiving or agreeing to receive for himself or for any other person any gratification as an inducement to or reward for.&nbsp; In order to effectively deter acts of corruption in Singapore, section 5(b) of the PCA penalises the demand for corruption, ie, it penalises, subject to other elements being satisfied, the corrupt giving, promising or offering to any person, whether for the benefit of that person or of any other person any gratification as an inducement or reward for.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, both the demand and supply of elements of corruption are tackled in tandem, resulting in Singapore's extremely low incidence of corruption.&nbsp; Why not use the same strategy to combat the rapid growth of unlicensed moneylending in Singapore, given that:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The anecdotal evidence that a significant number of those borrowing from loansharks are using the loan to pay off gambling debts?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, innocent residents have to bear the brunt of harassment if a false residential address is given?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole corridor suffers the stigma of graffitied walls even if a false address is not given?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;The continuing Government philosophy that if we continue to work, we will be given an incentive, such as WIS, why not make borrowing from illegal moneylenders, which causes much harm to the neighbourliness of communities, an offence?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Prosecutor is always in a position to exercise his discretion whether or not to prosecute the borrower based on the unique mitigating factors, if any.&nbsp; The number of reported cases and arrests in relation to unlicensed moneylending and related activities over the last three years is very worrying.&nbsp; I urge MHA to consider a shift in policy away from supply-centric enforcement to one which also combats the demand.&nbsp; This would be similar to the two-pronged enforcement action taken against drugs and corruption.&nbsp; Such a<p align=left>Column: 1138 </p> two-pronged strategy focusing on the supply and demand forces giving rise to the crime would pressure the offence from all sides and help lead it closer to extinction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I propose that MHA use a portion of its budget to analyse how a new provision can be introduced into the Moneylenders Act to make the borrowing of money from unlicensed moneylenders an offence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning, Sir, to my second cut.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>To Clamp Down on Prostitution and Associated Vices</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> The number of foreign prostitutes arrested in 2006 was 4,310.&nbsp; This was a 34% increase over 2005.&nbsp; In 2007, the number of foreign prostitutes arrested was 5,400.&nbsp; This signified a 25% increase over 2006.&nbsp; Bids to contain the trade in Geylang has not been successful.&nbsp; An evening drive down Duxton Road and Duxton Hill - which I did with my wife by the way - will prove that prostitutes operate well beyond the artificial borders of Geylang.&nbsp; Prostitution is working itself into our heartlands.&nbsp; Many of these sex workers come on two-week social visit passes.&nbsp; Just before the two weeks come to an end, the sex workers leave the country, usually by making their way to JB, only to return to Singapore the same day.&nbsp; This trip, which earns them an extended stay in Singapore, is known as the \"U-turn\".&nbsp; Many of them continue to ply the trade until caught for overstaying.&nbsp; I am told that they even get a free ticket home when repatriated after serving their jail sentences.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have all seen several reports in the press of prostitutes openly soliciting in coffeeshops.&nbsp; I have also received feedback that sexual services are offered at shops claiming to offer massages, especially, for some reason, massage parlours with curtains.&nbsp; The numbers speak for themselves: 34% rise in number of foreign prostitutes arrested from 2005 to <p align=left>Column: 1139 </p>2006, 25% rise from 2006 to 2007.&nbsp; What concrete steps will MHA take to curb the worrying figures?&nbsp; In particular, would MHA allocate a healthy budget to bolster the anti-vice squad with additional manpower and intelligence officers to:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Suss out new locations where sex syndicates operate?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, in Singapore, we have good roads and fast cars, but we do not have many good drivers.&nbsp; Each year, about 200 drivers and pedestrians are killed on our roads.&nbsp; Another 12,000 people were injured due to road accidents.&nbsp; This situation raises questions on our road safety rules and culture in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some road accidents are unavoidable, but the majority of them can be prevented if we have a comprehensive road safety system in Singapore.&nbsp; There are many limitations in our road safety system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, new drivers do not undergo very stringent road safety training or learning<p align=left>Column: 1140 </p> how to drive.&nbsp; Every driving school has its own standard and syllabus for its driving lessons.&nbsp; There is hardly any quality control to ensure that all new drivers adopt good road safety practices upon passing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, new drivers on probation can have access to high capacity engine cars or motorbikes.&nbsp; These new drivers do not have enough experience and thus do not know how to handle such powerful high-powered driving machines.&nbsp; Thus, we have recently witnessed a few fatal accidents along Dunearn Road and Upper Thomson Road, resulting in the deaths of five young Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, more drivers are driving recklessly, such as speeding, tailgating and drink-driving.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, there is a lack of police enforcement on reckless and dangerous driving after midnight hours.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But it is not just the number of vehicles on the roads which contribute to it. Driving habits cannot be ignored.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have all seen it.&nbsp; It just takes a minor accident to cause a massive jam, not along just the same road, on the opposite as well as drivers slow down to take a look. With our car population now surpassing 800,000, we have seen a steady rise in the number of accidents with fatalities and injuries over the past three years. Some accidents are unavoidable but most can be prevented with diligence and better driving habits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Traffic Police cannot be everywhere every time.&nbsp; Most of us would rather they would not.&nbsp; So much depends on individual drivers.&nbsp; And many drivers leave much to be desired, they switch lanes indiscriminately, they do not signal their intentions,&nbsp;they wait in yellow boxes, do not allow others to get in front <p align=left>Column: 1142 </p>of them, and so on.&nbsp; This is, of course, not unique to Singapore but those who have driven in other developed countries will know that while we are far behind in road manners, better discipline on the roads is not a pipe dream.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, we have read about tragic deaths involving backseat passengers. These tragedies could have been avoided had they worn seat belts. We have seat belt laws but rear passengers regularly flout them. The driver and front passengers invariably belt up, but rear passengers do not.&nbsp; I have also seen children jumping up and down in cars unrestrained while their minders have their seat belts on. These double standards are inexplicable. And it is not just about moving vehicles. Drive down Battery Road or Serangoon Road during peak hours and you will discover that congestion is partly due to the indiscriminate parking and pedestrian crossing. All these cause frustrations to the drivers, encouraging impatience and aggressive driving.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clearly more needs to be done to educate drivers and passengers and drive home the safety message.&nbsp; I am loath to suggest another campaign, but if they work, why not?&nbsp; In the meantime, there is no substitute for enforcement. The message should be driven home that inconsiderate and dangerous behaviour will not be tolerated. For example, many park indiscriminately because they are willing to risk the fine.&nbsp; It is time to come down harder, particularly on multiple offenders.&nbsp; It is also time to give the Traffic Police greater flexibility in the punishments it can dish out.&nbsp; For example, if fines do not work, why not allow for short suspensions?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also review the competency framework, like Dr Teo Ho Pin suggested, for example, how realistic are our driving test?&nbsp; Now you learn on a 1.3-litre Toyota and on passing, you are allowed to drive a Ferrari. We make <p align=left>Column: 1143 </p>distinctions for engine capacities of motorcycles. Why not the same for cars?&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating more tests or more costs but we can have a simple mechanism of only allowing those who have, say, three years of driving experience before they can handle high-capacity cars.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the rise of drink driving is a concern. The Police has implemented new measures to monitor hot spots but prevention should not left to the Police alone. Owners of drinking establishments should be given some responsibility to check that their patrons are capable of driving and to make arrangements to send them home if they are not. I would be grateful if the Minister could comment on this.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Crime Statistics</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Sir, each year, the Police release statistics on the crime situation in Singapore.&nbsp; However, the picture is not complete.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, reported crime.&nbsp; Last month, the Police reviewed a new approach when releasing statistics on crimes in 2007. This was a crime class approach where offences are grouped into six broad rubrics, for example, theft and related crimes, offences against&nbsp;the&nbsp;person and even miscellaneous crimes as a class.&nbsp; Could the Ministry clarify why this approach was adopted?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One weakness I find is that the public does not know exactly which crimes make up each crime class. For example, under offences against the person, it is stated that this class includes murder, rioting, rape and outrage of modesty, amongst others, which were not explained. The public will be interested to know if specific offences are on the rise but the information is only given ad hoc. Could the Police publish all the sub-<p align=left>Column: 1144 </p>categories and numbers in each crime class on its website?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, unreported crime.&nbsp; It is not accurate to rely on Police crime statistics to reflect the actual crime situation.&nbsp; What if a crime is not reported or it was reported&nbsp;but somehow went unrecorded by the Police?&nbsp; In order to uncover this dark figure of crime, victimisation surveys have been used in other jurisdictions. For instance, the Home Office in Great Britain has been running the British crime surveys since 1982 and in the United States, the national survey began even earlier.&nbsp; In such surveys, a representative cross-section of the population was asked whether they have been crime victims, whether they have reported the crime and the reasons for reporting or not reporting. Such surveys were very useful to uncover the actual crime situation, public perception of whether reporting crimes will be worthwhile, what stops people from reporting, and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that with the above improvements, we will get a clearer and more accurate picture of the crime situation which will help in crime prevention and Police service delivery.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Funding of Prisons</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade):</B> Sir,&nbsp;I want to talk about funding for prisons.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise that the physical security features of Whitley Road detention centre from which Mas Selamat Kastari escaped from is not in the same league as our other prison complexes.&nbsp; And this may be one reason for the unfortunate incident yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, last year, the operating budget of the Prison Service was about $235 million. Our&nbsp;former prison chief pointed out that this still makes it, and I quote, \"the cheapest prison system to work in the developed world.\"</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1145</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are certainly reasons to smile at this efficient use of resources, but I would like to ask three hard questions.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; First,&nbsp;can we have more figures about how we compare with the rest of the world?&nbsp; Second,&nbsp;are we funding our prisons adequately, in the light of our ageing population and the forecast of higher crime numbers in the light of the IRs and increased immigration?&nbsp;And third, can we explore creative options in our Prison Service such as best sourcing it to a private contractor?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the first question is relatively simple. I want to know if, man-for-man, we are spending less than other countries, as it seems to be implied by what our former Director of Prisons said.&nbsp; And if so, I would like to ask how we are managing to do so. Are we doing it&nbsp;at the expense of denying comforts to older prisoners, schools for younger prisoners, psychiatric care for the mentally ill and rehabilitation programmes for drug addicts?&nbsp; Do we have a good vocational and rehabilitation programme? Are there international benchmarks that we meet?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I know that prisoners also provide services to private companies to defray the cost of running the prisons. For example, some female inmates work as call centre operators. Sir, this is well and good, and I am sure that there are equally worthwhile projects going on inside. I wonder though, if there is merit in taking a more private sector approach to the management of the billion-dollar Changi Prison complex.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings me to&nbsp;my third question. Can we privatise Changi Prison?&nbsp; It is not a new idea.&nbsp; America has done it since 1985. Today, there are more than 150 for-profit prisons in 30 American states.&nbsp; In fact, one of them,&nbsp; the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) - for those<p align=left>Column: 1146 </p> who are interested in -&nbsp;is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. It is a listed company with a unique business proposition, but it is a business all the same.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If after 40 years of public housing, we can privatise part of HDB to help other countries with their homes, who is to say that we cannot help other Asian countries run their prisons?&nbsp; Viewed in this light, it is a clear candidate for private sector input. And it is a business that is expanding all the time. In the five years to 2000, the number of prisoners soared more than 50%, from 8,500 to 13,000.&nbsp; The number of arrests made by Police increased by 9.5% from 19,284 in 2004 to a record 21,108 in 2005. And, according to the World Prison Population List of King's College London International Centre for Prison Studies, the prison population rate,&nbsp;per 100,000 of national population,&nbsp;for Singapore, at 350, was the fifth highest in the world.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this points to a growing population in our prisons; and surely an increase in the spending needed. We ought to look at the manner, as well as the quantum, of spending.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Foreign Beggars</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Sir, in October 2007, 59% of the 68 beggars caught in Singapore during the year till that time were foreigners and they were subsequently referred to ICA&nbsp;or the Police for repatriation.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister: do we ban these repatriated beggars from entering Singapore?&nbsp; It seems that this problem has not been diffused and has, in fact, gotten worse.&nbsp; Our local media reported on a foreign syndicate of beggars who operate in Waterloo Street Temple.

Let me give an update.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been a security lapse at the Whitley Road Detention Centre, which allowed Mas Selamat to escape. &nbsp;Mas Selamat, at that time, was taken out of&nbsp;his&nbsp;cell where he was confined to go to the family visitation room to wait for the arrival of his family. &nbsp;He asked to go to the toilet from where he escaped. &nbsp;This should never have happened. &nbsp;I am sorry that it has. An independent investigation is underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not speculate now as to what and how it happened. Security at the centre has been stepped up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mas Selamat is a security threat which is why he was placed under preventive detention.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no information that he has any plans that threaten public security at this time. Nevertheless, we are not taking any chances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dr Teo asked why the public was only informed about four hours after the escape.&nbsp; Our security agencies assessed&nbsp;that there was no imminent danger to the public. The focus then was to lock down the Whitley Road Detention Centre and start&nbsp;a systematic operation to find and arrest him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1148 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priority is to find and arrest Mas Selamat.&nbsp; No efforts will be spared to track him down. Security at all our land, sea and air checkpoints have been tightened, including areas where there&nbsp;may be&nbsp;a possibility that he may leave our shores and from areas which are not&nbsp;the normal immigration checkpoints.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, I urge the public to stay calm and to report any suspicious sighting to the Police immediately. Anyone who renders assistance to him is committing a grave offence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now address the Members' comments on terrorism, drugs and public expression.&nbsp;SMS Ho Peng Kee will speak about&nbsp;crime and drugs and other issues in greater detail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the threat of the Al Qaeda and its proxy, the Jemaah Islamiyah,&nbsp;surfaced against us in 2001, Singapore was essentially not a direct target of international terrorist groups. Today, we are so targeted. We are living today in a different security climate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our security agencies have successfully disrupted local plots and terrorist networks so far. &nbsp;However, we have remained a \"trophy\" target in the eyes of the terrorists. Hence, apart from hardening security in key installations, including iconic buildings, we also need to step up security for international events held in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is also why&nbsp;we must treat certain crimes differently. For instance, any intrusion which breaches our borders must be treated as a security incident. Our officers must, in the first instance, deal with it as such even if the intruder eventually may turn out to be just a cigarette smuggler.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the threat of terrorism is by no means over, there have been fewer attacks in the major cities last year.

There is no way that we can monitor all the radical websites.&nbsp; Even if we&nbsp;were to <p align=left>Column: 1150 </p>block some of these websites, new ones will be created very quickly.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address such a threat, we need, firstly, to strengthen the efforts of our Muslim leaders in countering extremist ideology.&nbsp; Secondly, we need to raise Singaporeans' vigilance and resilience to detect those in our midst who have been infected by such extremist ideas and show signs of radicalisation.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am truly appreciative of our Muslim leaders' efforts, as they have not shied away from the problem.&nbsp; They are confronting the terrorism threat directly, even taking the fight online to counter the extremist ideology.&nbsp; MUIS, the RRG and other groups like Taman Bacaan and 4PM have established programmes to raise the awareness of the community, especially the young, against terrorist ideology.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to these efforts, we need to recognise that the threat of the self-radicalised terrorist must also be defeated by the vigilance of the others around him.&nbsp; Early warning signs in the individual's conduct can be discerned.&nbsp; Those who see it must recognise the significance and not be reluctant to report on him.&nbsp; Early intervention will help us nip the problem in the bud, and also help the individual in his recovery before he plunges deeper into terrorist and extremist violence.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There seems to be a creeping danger of polarisation between Muslim and non-Muslim communities in many countries.&nbsp; We see a greater intolerance and hardening of attitudes at the extreme ends of both communities.&nbsp; This is both compounded when provocative acts, like films which offend Muslims, are pursued in the name of freedom of speech or expression.&nbsp; Such ethnic polarisation only serves the cause of the <I>jihadist</I> extremists and terrorists.&nbsp; We must not allow this to happen in Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we address the ideological dimension of&nbsp;the threat, we must <p align=left>Column: 1151 </p>continue to make Singapore a hard target.&nbsp; I therefore agree with Mr Arthur Fong that in this regard, we must fully exploit technology.&nbsp; Our border security technology infrastructure, for instance, is a formidable resource.&nbsp; It has enhanced our operational capabilities.&nbsp; In 2007, ICA officers detected 37,800 cases of smuggling at our borders, a rise of 83% over 2006.&nbsp; This is a good proxy indicator because if we can catch people smuggling cigarettes or other items,&nbsp;we can catch people smuggling terrorist materials.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Fong is right that technology alone does not defeat determined criminals and terrorists.&nbsp; Technology is only a tool; the operator is the brain that makes it work.&nbsp; Hence, we invest heavily in the training and development of our officers.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm&nbsp;Ho Geok Choo has raised concerns with emergency readiness.&nbsp; Our agencies have a high level of preparedness, having built up significant capabilities.&nbsp; Singaporeans, however, must get more involved in preparing themselves and their families for emergencies.&nbsp; The SCDF conducts community emergency preparedness programme&nbsp;for the constituencies, and they impart life saving and emergency preparedness skills to the community.&nbsp; Since its implementation in 2003, participation has grown over the years.&nbsp; We have trained about 310,000 participants to date, and we encourage more participation, regardless of local or foreign.&nbsp; Everyone should know the basics of CPR, first aid and fire fighting. The four SCDF centres are open every day for training.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho will be pleased to note that the participants include many housewives, the elderly and students.&nbsp; We welcome ideas from Members on ways to broaden and deepen our outreach, as there can be no age or gender bias in dealing with terrorism.&nbsp; All must play a role.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But no government can provide total protection to all.&nbsp; Resources are not<p align=left>Column: 1152 </p> unlimited.&nbsp; Increasingly, the Home Team's resources are being stretched to&nbsp;meet the security and safety needs that come with higher tourist arrivals, a growing foreign worker population and an increasing number of mega international events like Formula One, APEC 2009 and the Youth Olympics in 2010.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order, security and safety are critical pre-conditions to any successful event or business.&nbsp; If we are unable to ensure the security and safety of everyone, be they Singaporeans, foreign VIPs, delegates and visitors, Singapore will decline as a premium event centre or investment destination.&nbsp; Security must be regarded as part and parcel of the cost and reality of doing business.&nbsp; Going forward, we must continue to engage business, industry and citizens to become stakeholders in their own security, as they ought to be.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the issue of drug abuse raised by Dr Teo, Dr Fatimah and Ms Sylvia Lim.&nbsp; The last two years saw an increase in the number of drug addicts returning to heroin abuse. This was partly due to the displacement from Subutex abuse.&nbsp; A more important reason is the increase in the regional production and supply of both opium based and synthetic drugs.&nbsp; We anticipate increased attempts by syndicates to smuggle drugs into Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, however, the most significant challenge is about maintaining the support of our community against drugs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am concerned by the increasing acceptance of the use of so-called social drugs or party drugs amongst some of our young.&nbsp; Some foreigners also expect to continue their drug taking habit in Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some argue that Singapore should follow the approach of liberal societies which have given up trying to stop drug abuse, and seek instead to minimise its dangers to the addicts by providing, for instance, clean needles for the addicts to \"shoot up\" safely.&nbsp; Those advocating this<p align=left>Column: 1153 </p> approach want us to dismantle our tough laws and permit drug abuse among our people.&nbsp; If we go down this road, we will unravel the relatively crime-free&nbsp;and drug-free society that we have today.&nbsp; We will continue to help addicts who are&nbsp;willing to take responsibility for their lives to overcome their addiction.&nbsp; However, our approach is and will remain one of harm prevention and zero tolerance.&nbsp; We must keep drugs out of our society and not go soft on drugs.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are plugged into a global environment and are open to&nbsp;a universe of ideas and their influence.&nbsp; Many ideas and values can benefit us.&nbsp; But others, like going soft on drugs, are harmful to us should&nbsp;we adopt them.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Eunice Olsen called for the Government to have a lighter touch when it comes to Singaporeans expressing their views on important public issues.&nbsp; I thank her for raising this important subject.&nbsp; Over the years, I believe we have seen real changes. We see more divergent views expressed through various avenues.&nbsp; This includes the press, Internet, various forums as well as letters and emails from individuals and groups directly to the Government and political leaders, like Ministers.&nbsp; I have received many such letters and emails of grievances or strong views about what we do or what we should do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are polite, some are very rude.&nbsp; But all are read and looked into.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accessibility to avenues to express one's views, therefore, is not wanting.&nbsp; In terms of&nbsp;Government reaction to such views, I believe that while&nbsp;the occasional robust response is given when felt necessary, there has been generally a more accommodative dialogue with the man-in-the-street.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have also evolved our policies in relation to different forms of expression.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1154 </p> To recapitulate, in the year 2000, we created the Speakers' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches.&nbsp; In 2004, we liberalised its use to include performances and exhibitions.&nbsp; In addition, we exempted all indoor public talks from the licensing requirement under the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act, so long as the organisers and speakers are Singapore citizens.&nbsp; The only content restriction to all these is that the speeches must not touch on race or religion, and&nbsp;Members know why.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have stopped short of allowing outdoor and street demonstrations.&nbsp; However, we allow demonstrations if they take place indoors or within the confines of stadiums, as the Police assess that any disorder will be better contained in such venues. We are presently reviewing how we can further liberalise the use of Speaker's Corner as an outdoor venue for more political activities including demonstrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our experiences in the past have taught us to be very circumspect about outdoor and street protests.&nbsp; The 1950 Maria Hertogh riots and the 1964 race riots, both started as peaceful assemblies, but eventually ended up with 54 dead, 736 injured, and significant damages to property.&nbsp; I think many Members&nbsp;in this House are either too young to remember these incidents or not even born yet.&nbsp; Some members of the public may say that this is all old history and should not apply to us today.&nbsp; Is it really so sanguine? I do not think so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, we constantly review our assumptions by monitoring the developments in other countries.&nbsp; And what we learn tells us that our concerns remain valid.&nbsp; In many supposedly mature societies, we see cases where peaceful protests do degenerate into riots and violence. &nbsp;Protest organisers do not typically declare that they want to hold a  <p align=left>Column: 1155 </p>violent protest.&nbsp; And although most people involved in a demonstration may have no intention of using violence,&nbsp;a handful of agitators can spark off mob violence quite easily.&nbsp; So, for young people in their exuberance, they may think that it is fun to demonstrate for whatever the cause.&nbsp; They have no control of the situation should agitators choose to exploit it.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question for Singaporeans is whether we should accept the risk and permit a culture of street protests.&nbsp; That is the key question.&nbsp; In my view, one riot is one riot too many.&nbsp; The scars of violence in a community take a long time to heal.&nbsp; Once lost, public confidence in our stability and security will take a long time to re-build.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now share with&nbsp;Members the views from a young Singaporean, Ms Khartini Khalid, who wrote to the Prime Minister after she attended the Prime Minister's Chinese New Year reception about 10 days ago.&nbsp; Ms Khartini is a grassroots leader and polytechnic lecturer.&nbsp; She said and I quote:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I was in the United States last summer on a State Department-sponsored programme on citizen participation in America.&nbsp; I attended an anti-war rally near Capitol Hill and saw how vibrant the spirit of the people was, due to America's freedom of speech provision in the constitution.&nbsp; I came back with a tinge of envy for societies with more \"freedom\" of expression.&nbsp; However, I got a reality check soon after when the Burmese uprising happened, and a few months later, the Hindraf protests.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It hit me then that the most important thing to a citizen is good governance, because without capable leaders, all the demonstrations and protests in the world would be meaningless.&nbsp; While persuasive arguments by Singapore's critics sometimes manage to seduce me, and while I continue to harbour hopes that the authorities will be less strict over certain matters, I realise that ultimately, I <p align=left>Column: 1156 </p>do not want Singapore to be like Burma, or Malaysia, or even the US.'</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, that is her&nbsp;view to the Prime Minister.&nbsp; I further quote:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It is by no choice of mine that I was born in Singapore.&nbsp; But it is a choice of mine now to stay and contribute to my country and to make a difference in whatever small way I can.&nbsp; I may not always agree with the Government but I am proud to be a Singaporean.&nbsp; I am happy that as a Malay Singaporean, I claim credit for whatever I do because of my efforts and not because of my race.&nbsp; I am happy that I am not part of a system which discriminates, even if it were to bring benefits to my race.'</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">1.00 pm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Like her, they may not always agree with the Government. But like her, they value good governance that Singapore enjoys. I believe that Singaporeans understand and support the fundamentals that have made Singapore what it is today. &nbsp;What are these fundamentals?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first fundamental is the rule of law. In a multi-religious society, the primacy of the secular law is especially vital. If we are to have maximum space to pursue our interests with equal basic protection, we must also observe equal basic liability and obligations. Not everyone likes this or that law. But everyone must abide by the law and respect its authority.&nbsp;Civil disobedience cannot be acceptable. In fact, more than even the political interest groups, the religious individual may lay greater claim to a moral basis to choose to disobey laws which are not in accord with his beliefs. If we allow this, our society will be torn apart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we must continue to uphold a regime which requires that we respect the <p align=left>Column: 1157</p>sensitivities of each ethnic community and not denigrate another&rsquo;s religion or ethnicity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third fundamental is that we will not allow foreigners to interfere in our domestic politics. They are free to share their ideas, views and criticisms, including on the Internet where Singaporeans can freely access them. But foreigners do not have the right of citizens to take part directly in the politics of Singapore. We will not allow, for example,&nbsp; foreign funding of political parties&nbsp;or sponsorship of candidates for election. Singaporeans alone have the sovereign right to determine what kind of society they want Singapore to be. Finally, with more de-regulation and autonomy, there must also be greater individual ownership, responsibility and accountability over the exercise of one&rsquo;s actions in these realms.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we will continue to review our policies and steer by these fundamentals. Singaporeans are neither a society of people with no views nor lacking the means to express them. We will hear and consider their views carefully. However, as we contemplate change, we are also mindful&nbsp;of the silent majority and their interests. Ultimately, the Singapore we create must be a Singapore for all.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Sir, let me first address the cuts on drug abuse, loansharking, and vice, and then&nbsp;the others later.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike isolated crimes of violence or theft, these offences (ie, drug abuse, loansharking and vice) are linked to larger issues.&nbsp; Hence, we must go beyond the offender, look at the underlying forces and issues which relate to these activities, and devise holistic strategies to tackle them, as we have done with drugs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On drug abuse, Dr Teo asks what the trends are. Last year, we arrested 2,166<p align=left>Column: 1158 </p> drug abusers, up from 1,218 the year before.&nbsp; 77% were repeat abusers. Abusers of Subutex went up by 416 and heroin&nbsp;went up by 554.&nbsp;&nbsp;These two accounted for most of the increase.&nbsp; Abuse of other drugs has abated somewhat with fewer arrests for Ketamine, Cannabis and Erimin-5.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we know, Subutex was permitted for use in drug replacement therapies in 2002. When we discovered its wide abuse and consequent addiction, we declared buprenorphine, Subutex&rsquo;s key ingredient, a controlled drug in August 2006. Mop-up operations then began. While the Subutex situation has improved, there has been some displacement effect - 285 of the heroin abusers arrested last year were former Subutex users. However, I think we should not over-state the connection. Indeed, as our drug enforcement measures against Subutex begin to take effect, I expect the number of Subutex abusers to fall over time.&nbsp; The monthly arrest figures bear this out.&nbsp; Compared to when the mop-up operations first began, the monthly arrest figures for Subutex users have come down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the increase in drug abusers arrested, according to the UN World Drug Report for 2007, Singapore has one of the lowest drug abuse prevalence rates in the world. This affirms that our comprehensive and holistic approach is effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Subutex phenomenon should pass, the&nbsp;emerging regional supply of drugs poses a serious, possibly drawn-out threat. We are monitoring this closely. Regional opium poppy cultivation has increased. As opium is the raw material for heroin production, more heroin will flood the market. Methamphetamine is now the main drug of abuse in much of East and Southeast Asia with signs of industrial-scale production. The proximity of drug production activities near our borders will lead to more attempts by drug syndicates to traffick drugs here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1159 </p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> CNB has therefore stepped up enforcement. Last year, CNB conducted 53 major operations and busted 27 syndicated trafficking activities. CNB smashed a syndicate that tried to bring in 3.5 kg of heroin on New Year&rsquo;s day. Another operation in February led to the largest haul of heroin in five years. CNB also works closely with its foreign counterparts to conduct training, intelligence exchanges, joint investigations and operations against illicit drug activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to Dr Teo, our checkpoints indeed form an important first line of defence. CNB works with other Home Team agencies to conduct intensive checks on persons, goods and vehicles, including deploying Narcotics Detector Dogs from the Police K-9 Unit daily at the land, sea and air checkpoints.&nbsp; Over the last three years, more than 250 traffickers were stopped at the checkpoints.&nbsp; In 2007, 105 traffickers were arrested, up from 90, the year before.&nbsp; CNB also has a wide intelligence network but for operational reasons, I cannot disclose details of its inputs to our arrests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Fatimah Lateef and Ms Sylvia Lim ask about the state and effectiveness of our Drug Rehabilitation Centres or DRCs, and Long Term or LT regime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of first time and second time drug abusers admitted to our DRCs has fallen from a high of 4,800 in 1994 to 510 last year. Last year, synthetic, heroin and Subutex abusers made up 40%, 30% and 27% of the admissions respectively. About half were Chinese, while Malays and Indians formed 38% and 13% of the DRC population, respectively. Nearly two-thirds of the admissions were first-timers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In response to Ms Sylvia Lim&rsquo;s question, let me say that the LT regime is a big plus, not a minus in our overall strategy. New drug abusers do not take up the habit by themselves.&nbsp; They are<p align=left>Column: 1160 </p> invariably introduced to it by a habitual drug abuser.&nbsp; The LT regime therefore serves a critical role of putting hardcore addicts out of circulation for some time, thereby reducing their contamination effect on others. Since its introduction in 1998, more than 5,000 persons have undergone it, with 4,000 now released.&nbsp; Only 15% or 609 of them who&nbsp;have completed the LT regime have relapsed to drugs. The LT regime has helped reduce the overall relapse rate from a high of&nbsp;50% in 1997 to 10%&nbsp;now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me assure Members, therefore, as I wind up on this segment on drugs, that the situation is firmly under control, notwithstanding the higher arrests last year.&nbsp; But we&nbsp;must press on, bringing all stakeholders like family members, businesses and the community on board.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me touch on unlicensed moneylending or loansharking. In 2005 and 2006, we strengthened measures to deal with the deteriorating situation by enhancing the penalties, invoking our preventive detention laws, introducing powers to confiscate assets and cancelling the passports of leaders to prevent them from controlling operations from overseas. More recently, we amended the Penal Code to enable us to prosecute persons who abet loansharking activities from overseas. We also worked with MAS, IRAS, HDB, town councils, banks, and SingPost to tighten their procedures and limit opportunities for exploitation by the loansharks. On its part, Police targeted syndicates and centralised their key operations at CID-level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Police has stepped up enforcement. Dr Teo asked how many loanshark cases have been resolved. Last year, six syndicates were smashed through intelligence-based operations, resulting in the arrest of 37 syndicate members. These syndicates were believed to have had a pool of 2,000 debtors, and had<p align=left>Column: 1161 </p> given out loans amounting to a total of more than $1 million. In total, 392 persons were arrested last year as compared to 294 the year before.&nbsp; In a landmark case, a loanshark&rsquo;s assets were confiscated. For the first time since 2001, the number of harassment and unlicensed moneylending cases fell from 10,221 in 2006 to 9,762 last year.&nbsp; So it is down about 4.5%. But I agree with Members who have spoken that&nbsp;the number remains unacceptably high.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loanshark syndicates have adjusted to changed circumstances. They now manipulate borrowers and use them to front illegal transactions. They leverage on borrowers to gain access to their bank accounts for electronic transactions. Desperate borrowers end up helping loansharks to apply for phone lines and to register pre-paid SIM cards under their own names. Some borrowers who are not able to repay the debts become runners to harass other borrowers. Some leaders of loanshark syndicates are also operating from overseas and this impedes Police investigations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the problems created by loansharking are increasingly not confined to those who borrow.&nbsp; Some borrowers furnish outdated or false home addresses to avoid harassment, leading to innocent households being harassed.&nbsp; Last year, about half of the harassment cases reported&nbsp;were perpetrated against innocent victims.&nbsp; We will do more to stop this, by requiring persons who apply to update their home address in their NRICs to furnish some proof such as bills to show that they are indeed staying there. Also, ICA and HDB will work together to get persons who buy or sell HDB flats to update their NRIC addresses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, with the&nbsp;Integrated Resorts being built, I agree with Members that we must <p align=left>Column: 1162 </p>do more&nbsp;to root out loanshark syndicates.&nbsp;So far, we have experienced some success in taking out syndicates through enforcement. But as Mr Fong suggests, more needs to be done to hit particularly at the&nbsp;core of syndicates.&nbsp; Loansharking is really a form of organised crime. This explains its persistent and insidious nature, making it difficult for Police to root out. When we prosecute and imprison their runners, the organisation simply recruits new members to replenish their ranks. The new recruits are either too naive or simply not deterred by the existing laws and penalties. We are therefore exploring ways to address the organised nature of loansharking squarely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr de Souza suggests punishing those who borrow from loansharks.&nbsp; We will study his suggestion seriously. I agree that those who borrow to feed their vices or subsequently abet loansharks in their operations should not be also treated as victims. They are part of the problem.&nbsp; But I am sure he agrees that&nbsp;not every borrower is in this category and we should also recognise that the social circumstances behind these borrowers are wide-ranging.&nbsp;So, what do we do? We have to differentiate.&nbsp; I think he&nbsp; suggests an approach where the Public Prosecutor is given the discretion and,&nbsp;indeed, he has the discretion, but he will exercise it consciously and carefully. We will study this&nbsp;issue and&nbsp;include in our study the profiles of&nbsp;borrowers and their habits, so as to strike a balance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Dr Teo's point on public education, Police will soon be launching a public awareness campaign to highlight the pitfalls of borrowing from loansharks. As loansharking affects the entire community, we need to encourage community action to help stem this problem. It is good to see local communities rising to the challenge to mount CSSP projects to combat loanshark harassment. Such efforts make the neighbourhood a more difficult area for loansharks to harass<p align=left>Column: 1163 </p> without being detected.

They were repatriated and banned from entering Singapore again.&nbsp; As far as I know, they paid for their own plane tickets and were not part of any vice syndicates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our enforcement strategy, therefore, is a pragmatic one, focusing on confining activities within the traditional red light areas and keeping vice off our&nbsp;streets.&nbsp; Last year, Police conducted some 950 vice-related operations island-wide, up from 890 the year before.&nbsp; Tough enforcement action is also taken in the heartlands, a point Mr de Souza makes,&nbsp;and also in other places, like the Duxton cluster, and so forth.&nbsp;In the heartlands,&nbsp;the number of foreigners arrested for vice activities remains low, accounting for less than 1% of all vice-related arrests but&nbsp;I <p align=left>Column: 1164</p>agree that it is a continuous thing that we must do to keep vice off our streets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr&nbsp;de Souza suggests beefing up the Anti-Vice Branch&nbsp;(AVB).&nbsp; I assure him that we would not let manpower constraints, if any, hamper our efforts.&nbsp; That said,&nbsp;while AVB, as&nbsp;a CID specialist unit, focuses on vice issues and enforcement, it does not work in isolation.&nbsp; It works closely with all six Police Divisions across the country.&nbsp; In fact, community partnership to deal with the vice is also undertaken by the division Police officers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Police will continue to enforce and explore ways in consultation with various stakeholders, including Members like Dr Lateef who is very active heading&nbsp;a multi-agency taskforce trying to improve the situation in Geylang for the sake of her residents.&nbsp;And we will do that to prevent the local vice situation from getting out of control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr de Souza said he has received feedback concerning vice.&nbsp; If&nbsp;he knows of massage establishments&nbsp;in other places,&nbsp;he should let me have the feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;If serious enough,&nbsp;Police will look at it and, if need be, enforce, as they have done,&nbsp;checks on&nbsp;these establishments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to other issues raised by Members, ie, road safety, crime statistics and funding of prisons and foreign beggars.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on road safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say&nbsp;that Singapore&rsquo;s roads are among the safest worldwide.&nbsp; The Road Accident Fatality rate per 100,000 persons dropped from 5.63 in 1998 to 4.2 in 2006, increasing slightly to 4.68&nbsp;last year. The fatal accident rate per 100,000 vehicle population increased from 2.34 in 2006 to 2.60&nbsp;last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motorcyclists and pillion riders remain the most vulnerable group of road users, contributing to 47% of total road fatalities <p align=left>Column: 1165 </p>in 2007.&nbsp; Young and new drivers and riders are also very vulnerable.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police, therefore, stepped up enforcement efforts&nbsp;last year,&nbsp;a point mentioned by Dr Teo and Mr Hri Kumar.&nbsp; Its officers are deployed round the clock to patrol Singapore's roads.&nbsp; Compared to 2006, 19% more summonses were issued for moving, parking and pedestrian offences; 7% more drivers and riders were arrested for drink driving; 86% more summonses were issued for red-running violations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drink driving is another area of focus.&nbsp; Mr Kumar points out this issue.&nbsp; The pubs and entertainment outlets are key stakeholders to counter drink-driving.&nbsp; Whilst operators play their part by providing services such as arranging for taxis to send patrons who have consumed alcohol home, more can and will be done.&nbsp; Members must have read about a new 'ring-fencing' strategy in the media, so I will not repeat it here.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If necessary, we will implement other measures such as mandating drinking outlets to provide breathalysers for self-testing.&nbsp; I commend the polytechnic students who stepped up to set up a \"Students Against Drink Driving\" website, leveraging on new media to alert their peers to the dangers of drink driving.&nbsp; My point is that we want to get&nbsp;more stakeholders on board.&nbsp; It is not a problem that it is only for the Police to handle.&nbsp; But, here, everyone can play a part.&nbsp; And I applaud these&nbsp;students for doing their part to reach out to their peers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share Mr Kumar's concerns about habitual offenders of our traffic rules.&nbsp; Under the Driver Improvement Points System, recalcitrant offenders are suspended for one year or longer and have to re-take a driving test before they can drive again.&nbsp; If a motorist commits <p align=left>Column: 1166 </p>very serious traffic offences such as causing death by dangerous driving, or by rash, or negligent act, his licence will be suspended on the day he is charged in court.&nbsp; Repeat drink driving offenders will also face mandatory imprisonment.&nbsp; We constantly review our laws.&nbsp; I will ask Traffic Police to consider Mr Kumar's suggestions for harsher penalties and to expand Traffic Police's powers to suspend licences.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, enforcement is only one aspect of the solution.&nbsp; A more enduring approach is to get our road users to develop better driving habits, through effective public education.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, regular talks, exhibitions and large-scale campaigns such as the Road Courtesy Campaign, Annual Shell Traffic Games and the Anti-Drink-Driving Campaign&nbsp;reinforce these messages, including the importance of using seatbelts and child restraints, a point that&nbsp;has been made here.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is a need separately to have a month long campaign just to coincide with&nbsp;F1.&nbsp; But certainly the message that the F1 should not lead to more accidents&nbsp;or more errant behaviour on our road should be constantly emphasised, a point Mr Ang Mong Seng makes.&nbsp; As for education, Traffic Police is currently producing a new pamphlet, which will highlight the consequences of not wearing seatbelts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These large scale public campaigns are complemented by targeted initiatives to achieve maximum impact. A good example is a Motor Cycle Task Force which has launched a focused \"Ride Safe Campaign&rdquo;, another focus campaign,&nbsp;with young people coming on board,&nbsp;and they are tapping the expertise of another group of stakeholders like motorcycle clubs to promote safe riding&nbsp;in young riders&nbsp;in ITEs and polytechnics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kumar suggests that for new drivers, we should only confine them to <p align=left>Column: 1167 </p>smaller capacity cars.&nbsp; I think he takes a leaf from motorcycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a distinction.&nbsp; For motorcycles, you handle the machine.&nbsp; You are riding on it.&nbsp; So the control situation is different.&nbsp; For new cars, they&nbsp;can also go fast and indeed can pick up fast as well.&nbsp; I&nbsp;do not think any country makes&nbsp;a distinction.&nbsp; This is something that we can look at, but for now, I think we&nbsp;will leave it be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom-line, therefore, on road safety is that everyone should take personal responsibility to keep our roads safe.&nbsp; How?&nbsp; I would suggest first starting with our own road behaviour by internalising safe driving behaviour.&nbsp; And that is where&nbsp;families and friends can come in, reminding each other that when they leave the home everyday, the message that pops up is, \"I will drive safely on the road today.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents can also act responsibly by&nbsp;using proper child restraints.&nbsp; Whilst enforcement and public education have their roles, ultimately my point is that it boils down to the individuals like you and me and certainly, for road safety,&nbsp;we can all&nbsp;make a difference.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On crime statistics, Ms Sylvia Lim proposes that Police further breaks down the statistics released and to include non-seizable offences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me clarify upfront that Police can&nbsp;release further breakdown of crime statistics, where it keeps track of the figures.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in relation to the Overall Crime statistics which Police publishes twice a year, the intent is to let the public have a good sense of the general safety and security situation in Singapore.&nbsp; Specific crimes are included not because they are seizable or not, but because they are relevant to public concerns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain how.&nbsp; With the annual release of the Overall Crime statistics, Police also publishes the statistics of six crime classes. These classes have been<p align=left>Column: 1168 </p> chosen to take into account the seriousness of the offences, measured in terms of harm or potential harm suffered by the victim&nbsp;- to the person, to property&nbsp;and to the public at large.&nbsp; They offer a better description of the crime concerns and trends compared to individual offences which tend to fluctuate over short terms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Ms Lim's suggestion to gather data on unreported crime, I know that this is done in some countries like the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, these surveys tend to be inaccurate as they depend on respondents' subjective recollection. &nbsp;They are however useful in societies where the public may be apprehensive in coming forward to report crime due to the lack of reporting channels or lack of trust in the Police.&nbsp; This is certainly not the case in Singapore. &nbsp;In fact, Singaporeans are quick to report a crime even when it is not a seizable offence because they want to put on record the incident and also get the Police to look into it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the SPF is highly accessible to the public.&nbsp; Island-wide, there are some 358 contact points for members of the public to report crimes and provide feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;Police can be contacted through telephone, letters, emails and online reporting through the Electronic Police Centre.&nbsp; '999' lines and NPC counters are open 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also strong Police-Community partnership.&nbsp; For the past five years, public-assisted arrests have accounted for about four in&nbsp;10 arrests for selected major offences.&nbsp; In fact, Singapore ranked first for Reliability of Police Services in the 2005-2006 Global Competitiveness Report.&nbsp; So I think there is no need to conduct such a survey in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seah Kian Peng asks about the funding of Prisons.&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, our Prison spends about one to two-thirds of<p align=left>Column: 1169 </p> what other developed countries, such as UK and Hong Kong, spend on an inmate per day. Yet, we have achieved one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world.&nbsp; Indeed, these rates have improved over the years.&nbsp; For the cohort of prisoners released in 2004, 23.7% was incarcerated again for a new offence within&nbsp;two years of release.&nbsp; This is a significant improvement from 1998, when the recidivism rate peaked at 44.4%.&nbsp; This shows that our Prison is cost effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure Mr Seah that all inmates are given basic amenities and have access to medical care.&nbsp;&nbsp; They undergo a comprehensive rehabilitative programme that addresses their criminogenic needs, whilst enhancing their educational level, employability and promoting family bonding, and eventual reintegration into society.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work-therapy is part of the rehabilitation process to help inmates acquire life skills and the discipline to work.&nbsp; They may be employed to provide services to private companies under a Private Sector Participation Scheme.&nbsp; The main aim of work-therapy, however, is to rehabilitate inmates, not to defray the cost of running the Prison.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;as the proportion of elderly inmates above 60 years is low at 1.2%, Prison does not have a specialist facility for aged offenders. But it will monitor the Prison's population trend and review if there is a need for one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Seah suggests privatising Changi Prison Complex (CPC) to save costs.&nbsp; Sir, Prison is always studying new ways to operate more efficiently.&nbsp; The consolidation of several stand-alone institutions into the CPC is intended to enhance our Prison capacity and reap economies of scale.&nbsp; The CPC leverages on technology to make operational processes efficient and provide a safe and secure <p align=left>Column: 1170 </p>environment which is conducive for conducting comprehensive programmes for prisoners.&nbsp; We have built-in flexibility to expand the CPC depending on future demand for prison space.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outsourcing is another strategy Prison considers, including the possibility of outsourcing its operations.&nbsp; Since 1999, Prison has outsourced two of its non-core functions, namely, the provision of medical services for prisoners and escort duties of prisoners with low security risks, to the private sector. This has allowed Prison to concentrate its resources on the core functions of the safe custody and rehabilitation of prisoners while reaping cost and manpower savings.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, any proposal to privatise or fully outsource the management of a Prison institution requires careful analysis.&nbsp; I am sure Mr Seah agrees.&nbsp; There are safety and security concerns.&nbsp; While privatised prisons are enjoying a growth in western countries, the impetus for privatisation varies with countries and is not always due to fiscal reasons.&nbsp; For instance, in the United Kingdom and Australia, concerns over the stifling influence that prison officer unions had on prison operations prompted privatisation. Thus far, reports on the performance of private prisons have been inconclusive.&nbsp; Whether private prisons adequately serve the interests of inmates and society remain to be seen.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on foreign beggars, which is Ms Lee Bee Wah&rsquo;s concern. &nbsp;Sir, foreign beggars, when detected by MCYS and police officers, are repatriated and barred from entering Singapore permanently. Last year, 83 persons were picked up, out of whom 68 were foreigners.&nbsp; These foreign beggars were repatriated and banned from entering Singapore permanently.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Police enquiries to date have not found such persons to be involved in any organised crime syndicates. But, still,&nbsp;we are monitoring<p align=left>Column: 1171</p> the situation.&nbsp; I know action has been taken.&nbsp; There have been media reports on this, but when they are detected, working with MCYS, Police and ICA will do the necessary.&nbsp; I, therefore, assure Mdm Lee that the entry of these foreign beggars does not constitute a breach of our security and when they try to come back, they will be detected at our checkpoints.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.30 pm&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude.&nbsp; The wide range of issues DPM Wong and I&nbsp;have touched on shows the complexity of the Home Team's work.&nbsp; The challenges will grow with globalisation and as our society develops.&nbsp; The Home Team cannot deal with these challenges on its own.&nbsp; Singaporeans understand this and have responded by taking ownership of these issues.&nbsp; Sir, the point is working together, especially stakeholders who have expertise to offer, please come on board.&nbsp; Whether it is counter-terrorism, promoting road safety,&nbsp;fighting drug abuse,&nbsp;keeping the vice situation under control or, in particular,&nbsp;tackling loansharks, which is really a ground phenomenon,&nbsp;Police cannot be&nbsp;eyes and ears all the time.&nbsp; But I am happy to see, for example, the formation of CSSPs on the ground by some constituencies where they keep alert for harassers who come.&nbsp; So as we end this part on MHA's cuts, I will call more Singaporeans to come on board.&nbsp; I thank and commend the efforts of those who have done so and I am confident that with the continued support of Singaporeans, we can navigate successfully through all these challenges and ensure that Singapore remains a peaceful, safe and secure home for all.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The second clarification is on drug abuse.&nbsp; I think we should not take comfort that the increase in drug abuse cases in Singapore is&nbsp;due to the increase in production in the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;What it shows is that our barriers are not watertight.&nbsp; As a result, drugs are being available and trafficked into Singapore for abusers.&nbsp; So we should instead focus our effort on measures to strengthen our barriers and to monitor drug abusers in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can elaborate on measures taken to strengthen the barriers and whether&nbsp;we are deploying more sniffer dogs to prevent trafficking.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

When it is completed, yes, the House will be kept informed as to what took place.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the comment on our border and the reason why we still have drugs coming in and&nbsp;cigarettes being smuggled, no country can guarantee a watertight security around its shores, particularly when we have a shoreline which is also quite long and we have only a few&nbsp;checkpoints around Singapore.&nbsp; It is not difficult for anyone who is determined to plan to leave Singapore or to come into Singapore if he wants to do so.&nbsp; All he needs is just a&nbsp;very high speed boat, and within minutes&nbsp;he can come in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite what we do, and we have radars all round our coast, there could still be people who would slip into Singapore.&nbsp; But at the checkpoints where we have security and&nbsp;immigration, you can be assured that 100% checks are being&nbsp;conducted, and that is why you see that we have over 30,000 cases of smuggling being detected at our checkpoints, a very significant increase in the number of detection.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1173 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can strengthen barriers as much as possible and, indeed, this is done.&nbsp; I think if Members were to visit the ICA checkpoints, they will know there is a whole host of security measures as well as people manning the right places to ensure that those who want to come in illegally will be detected.&nbsp; Dogs are used from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have dogs all over the place like in some countries,&nbsp;as the&nbsp;dogs may not do the job well if they are too tired.&nbsp; So dogs are deployed at the appropriate time and when we have&nbsp;significant numbers of people coming in and that we need to deploy dogs for&nbsp;specific purposes, we will do so.&nbsp; At the Woodlands train checkpoint, for example, we do have dogs.&nbsp; Dogs are not just for drugs but also for explosives and so on.&nbsp; So, we will do as much as we can, but no country can guarantee that we will have a watertight security such as no fly can get into Singapore.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Many borrow because of gambling activities, and some may have genuine<p align=left>Column: 1174 </p> need for funding.&nbsp; So this will affect a lot of people if we go ahead with it.&nbsp; But the fact that we are prepared to consider it is already a step forward because we have been thinking about it.&nbsp; We have thought about the suggestion before&nbsp;but we said no.&nbsp; So we have tried all the other measures.&nbsp; It is, in fact, a significant step that now at least we are prepared to study&nbsp;it and we are open to doing it.&nbsp; But we want to study it further, partly in terms of the impact on the ground.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, of course, we also draw a distinction between what may start off as innocent borrowers and then they slip down the slippery slope and&nbsp;become abettors.&nbsp;

Sir, first regarding the statistics released by the Police for crimes in 2007.&nbsp; I was not sure whether I heard the SMS correctly to say that the Police would actually release the statistics which they collate regularly.&nbsp; In other words, even though they are adopting a crime class approach now,&nbsp;they will actually give the <p align=left>Column: 1176 </p>breakdown of all the different offences and the occurrences of those offences that make up that total for that crime class.&nbsp; Is the&nbsp;SMOS saying that they would actually publish the sub-categories and the numbers on the website since they are gathering it anyway?&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern is that the crime class is very broad and it may mask certain trends within individual offences in the class.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, with regard to the crime surveys, the Senior Minister of State mentioned that our system is accessible to all Singaporeans, there is&nbsp;high confidence and so on, but I think it is a little bit unscientific at the moment to claim that because we do not have data&nbsp;showing that.&nbsp; And the crime surveys in other countries have actually managed to flag out certain groups which find the criminal justice system inaccessible.&nbsp; So, in Singapore's context, I am just thinking aloud, we may find, for example, that foreign workers, even though they are victims of crime,&nbsp;may not come forward to report.&nbsp; There may be other groups with less education, and so on.&nbsp; So, are we not&nbsp;interested to find out how accessible our criminal justice system&nbsp;is actually to all groups of Singaporeans?&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, the crime surveys -</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Sir,&nbsp;the context of different countries for doing different things is important.&nbsp; I think we had this debate yesterday.&nbsp; So certain countries which are vast, like the UK, do unreported crime surveys to really find out what is happening on the ground.&nbsp; But, in Singapore, I think we are compact -&nbsp;we have&nbsp;4.6 million people - and Police is there on the ground all the time, including the NPCs and also other officers who are in touch with the grassroots leaders&nbsp;and the residents.&nbsp; So, I do not think there is a need to formalise this with&nbsp;surveys because feedback comes back all the time.&nbsp; I am sure Ms Lim and Members of the House will agree.&nbsp; We get an earful from&nbsp;residents should there be&nbsp;dissatisfaction with Police services on the ground, whether it is molest cases or foreign workers who drink in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; So I do not think there is a need like in some countries to do&nbsp;formal crime surveys.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My point is, therefore, not that Police is not interested to know the perceptions of Singaporeans as to the state of the service or whether or not some Singaporeans indeed do not report crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point,&nbsp;like I have said, the context is important.&nbsp; In some countries, people do not report crime because they are not sure&nbsp;of what follow-up action there will be and it is difficult to report crime.&nbsp; But, in Singapore, there is access to the Police in terms of the ease with which Singaporeans can report crime.&nbsp; That is one&nbsp;point.&nbsp; Secondly, it is the confidence&nbsp;Singaporeans have that when they do report a crime, it is taken seriously, there is follow-up action, and&nbsp;it is not just there for the record.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I think we can say&nbsp;with some certitude that the<p align=left>Column: 1178 </p> percentage of unreported&nbsp;crimes in Singapore is low.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first point, she has heard me wrongly.&nbsp; I am not saying&nbsp;that the Police will change&nbsp;the current practice; in fact, it was&nbsp;just implemented last year where they now take an Overall Crime approach.&nbsp; I have explained in my speech why we do that.&nbsp; Because, really, the message&nbsp;is that Singaporeans&nbsp;will be interested to find out what is the general trend for crimes that impact them -&nbsp;the person, the property and the public at large.&nbsp; So the six categories already reflect that.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assurance is that, in terms of selecting the offences to be put in each of these&nbsp;categories, ie, the basket of offences, Police has&nbsp;looked at what these offences are and has chosen offences which will impact public safety.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in this review, offences such as simple cheating or transmitting hoax messages have been put into the basket of offences that would then be reflected in the six categories, while offences such as breach of hire purchase agreement or pyramid selling have been taken out.&nbsp; So when Singaporeans read that, they will get a good sense as to whether Singapore is becoming safer or not. But this is not the&nbsp;be-all and end-all&nbsp;of everything because, as Ms Sylvia Lim has said, when there is&nbsp;a need to put out advisories, when there is a need to have media stories about particular crime trends, this will also take place.&nbsp; Indeed, even in the last annual release of statistics, Police took the opportunity to highlight certain areas of concern. Youth crime was one.&nbsp; Crime against elderly was the other. I think Ms Ellen Lee spoke on it the other day. And also scams by telephone or other means was another.&nbsp; So I think Singaporeans&nbsp;do have a sense as to what to look out for.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>1.45 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; I would like to remind Members to keep their clarifications short <p align=left>Column: 1179 </p>and no speeches, please, so that we can get more questions in.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</B> One clarification.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to check whether using high-powered boats is a common method of trafficking drugs into Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;If yes, what measures are in place to prevent it?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Yes, indeed, the smugglers have tried using&nbsp;high speed boats to come into Singapore.&nbsp; For us, we have also upgraded our PCG craft to be equally high speed, in fact, even faster in some cases.

ASEAN should demonstrate solidarity in not only ratifying the Charter, but in its readiness to help each other to achieve the ideals spelt out in the Charter and to hold each other up to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, good governance in ASEAN countries can improve the prospects of growth in this region and help its neighbours to also prosper. This is because good governance can be a competitive advantage. In this globalised world, where&nbsp;the contagion effect is real, businessmen want transparency, rule of law, political stability and an effective government able to respond to changes rapidly. As we work towards achieving the ASEAN Economic Committee by 2015, we should hence give more weight to the building of stronger governing practices in ASEAN.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, at this stage, with Myanmar and its appalling human rights record and poor governance, it is hard to see how ASEAN can remain a credible grouping if its common ground rules and ideals are blatantly flouted by a member with little signs of real progress.&nbsp; After the Charter is ratified, will members be prepared to take measures against those who continuously flout its principles and rules?&nbsp; Or will it yet be another consultative mechanism without any teeth?&nbsp; What does it mean then to become a rules-based organisation?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I also ask the Minister how he expects the proposed ASEAN human rights body to work and to bring tangible benefits to the lives of the people in this region? Does Singapore also intend to set up a human rights commission as part of the process?&nbsp; To build a sense of solidarity and identity, ASEAN should also reach out to the public to explain why ASEAN integration is a good thing and how it will improve their lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister to explain how it will benefit the ordinary Singaporean?<p align=left>Column: 1184 </p> Does it mean ease of travel, ability to turn to an ASEAN Embassy when abroad and so on?&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for an assessment and to tell us about the way forward.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>ASEAN Charter</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Michael Palmer (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Sir, the ASEAN Charter is a milestone in the development of ASEAN.&nbsp; This House was recently told that in order to ensure that ASEAN realises its whole potential, we need to bring the Charter into force as soon as possible and that is a key priority.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three months on, I believe that only four countries have ratified the Charter, including Singapore.&nbsp; Some countries like the Philippines have said that they will not ratify the Charter until Myanmar embraces democracy and releases opposition leader, Aung San Suu&nbsp;Kyi.&nbsp; Could the Minister please tell us which countries have yet to ratify the Charter? What is the timeline for the ratification, whether there are any countries which he envisages may not ratify the Charter, and if so, why?&nbsp; Does the Charter come into effect if any of the member states fails to ratify it?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the aims of the Charter is to transform ASEAN into a more effective and rules-based organisation, thereby leading to greater ASEAN integration. A key instrument in the integration process is the Charter. We are told that ASEAN has made good efforts in its integration process because the leaders share a common view that each member country is better off with a strong ASEAN.&nbsp; But then, we have Myanmar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When civil unrest broke out&nbsp;in Myanmar&nbsp;last year, ASEAN made attempts to help Myanmar. All attempts and approaches by ASEAN were rebuffed.&nbsp; Myanmar chose only to deal with the United Nations. Unfortunately, the position and attitude of Myanmar throughout has not shown any desire on<p align=left>Column: 1185 </p> its part to be integrated with ASEAN. Could the Minister share his views on how does the experience with Myanmar square with the efforts to make ASEAN more integrated?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister his views on Indonesia signing of the Charter.&nbsp; Will they ratify it?&nbsp; And even if they do, will they abide by its terms?&nbsp; After all, it was about seven months before Indonesia signed the Charter that they signed the Extradition Treaty and Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA).&nbsp; The Indonesians subsequently raised various issues concerning the DCA which I can only surmise as being a tactic&nbsp;aimed at scuttling&nbsp;implementation of the DCA. What&nbsp;makes us so sure that they will not do the same with the Charter?&nbsp; More importantly,&nbsp;does the ASEAN Charter contain any mechanisms which will encourage its signatories to abide by its terms and any decisions made pursuant to it?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the last issue which I would like to raise - Article 14 of the Charter - the Human Rights Body. The Charter has resolved to create an ASEAN Human Rights Body but the Charter does not contain very much detail about the Human Rights Body, unlike the provisions relating to the ASEAN Community&nbsp;Councils.&nbsp; More significantly, it does not contain any provisions for enforcing human rights standards or any indication of what those standards may be.&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I ask the Minister when the Human Rights Body is likely to be established?&nbsp;

The world was watching how ASEAN would handle Myanmar at this Summit, and ASEAN fell flat to the ground.&nbsp; All credibility was lost.&nbsp; ASEAN was held hostage by Myanmar and could do nothing in the face of Myanmar's intransigence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I know that in geopolitical terms, it is better to keep Myanmar within <p align=left>Column: 1187 </p>ASEAN than to leave it out.&nbsp; It&nbsp;may help to prevent Myanmar from being too drawn into or be dependent on China, but there is a limit to the price for keeping Myanmar within the ASEAN fold.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Developing Human Rights Policy</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Prof. Thio Li-ann (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Chairman, since 1967, security, trade, and economic development have been ASEAN priorities, while human rights have been marginalised as internal state matters.&nbsp; The explicit incorporation of human rights in the ASEAN Charter is momentous.&nbsp; It accepts that human rights are the common heritage of mankind, rather than to be viewed suspiciously as a politicised imposition of foreign standards by the so-called 'West'.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, ASEAN has approached social welfare and poverty alleviation as a matter of 'human development' rather than \"human rights\", which are enforceable claims against the state, leashing state power.&nbsp; Human development focuses on government duties to run programmes to meet social needs like housing, education, health.&nbsp; However, who enforces such duties where the government fails in this task?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore adopts a \"human development\" approach towards securing human<p align=left>Column: 1189 </p> welfare.&nbsp; Government leaders have argued that excessive emphasis on individual rights over community interests can be destabilising and retard development.&nbsp; Critics have called this an apology for power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The counter retort may be: would Singaporeans prefer a right to housing, or a house?&nbsp;&nbsp; Times have changed.&nbsp; Minister Raymond Lim has said we are not allergic to human rights.&nbsp; But much remains to be done before rhetoric becomes reality and to ensure legitimate cultural differences do not undermine universal standards.&nbsp; I hope the Minister will consider the following points in developing human rights policy at the international, domestic and regional level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the international level, is the Government considering signing other treaties in addition to the ones on Genocide, Children and Women, which we signed in 1995?&nbsp; This would clarify the ambit of what it considers the 'hard core' of universally accepted human rights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government once stated that substance was more important than form when asked whether it would sign the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), pointing to our good race relations track record.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we cannot discount the effect of signing treaties, as a statement of principle to ourselves and the world. &nbsp;Let our pragmatism not be idealism-free.&nbsp; Signing CERD would underscore our commitment to racial equality and allow us to showcase our model of multi-racial harmony to the world, to lead by example.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor does the Government have to wait until our domestic law perfectly aligns with international standards.&nbsp; Certain human rights provide goals which<p align=left>Column: 1190 </p> countries realise progressively, not immediately.&nbsp; For example, CEDAW requires states to take measures to eliminate discrimination of women in political life; its oversight Committee recommends&nbsp; that&nbsp; women's participation in politics should reach a critical mass of 30-35% to have a real impact on political decision-making;&nbsp; 20% of our elected MPs are women after the last General Elections (up from 12%); the 35% target provides us with a human rights benchmark worth working towards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our foreign policy is driven by trade and security concerns. Perhaps some attention could be directed to the possibility of signing human rights treaties concerning race discrimination, disabled peoples' rights and socio-economic rights.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the domestic front, one way we can go global is by going 'local', through embodying global standards in local laws or \"glocalisation\".&nbsp; For example, Article 12 of the Constitution could be amended to explicitly prohibit discrimination against women, rather than to leave&nbsp;it implicit.&nbsp; Malaysia has done so, giving effect to its CEDAW obligations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I realise signing a treaty or enacting anti-discrimination legislation may be more pious platitude than practical, let us not discount the role of the symbolic and how legal norms can accelerate positive social change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need a clear benchmark to ground human rights policy.&nbsp; I suggest recognising the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a minimal standard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UDHR was drafted in response to European Barbarism after World War Two; its drafters included experts drawn from the Confucian, Islamic, Hindu, Christian and Marxist tradition. &nbsp;It is holistic, and includes the three generations of civil-political, socio-economic and 'solidarity' rights.&nbsp; It is not a charter for radical <p align=left>Column: 1191</p>individualism and recognises rights are limited by duties and the common good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year is the Declaration's 60th anniversary.&nbsp; Perhaps we should embrace and celebrate its standards, through school programmes and public education measures.&nbsp; This would be a positive way of domesticating human rights</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one way to localise and develop global standards is through a national human rights institution, staffed by Singaporeans familiar with local conditions.&nbsp; Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines have adopted such institutions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we need a dedicated rights-oriented institution, where the current preference is to deal with rights issues informally or ad hoc, through petitioning MPs or Ministries?&nbsp; Without discounting the importance of having good governors, certain points may be considered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, institutions are permanent and provide a systematic focal point for citizens to resort to, which enhances accountability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a national body can help us take ownership by carving out our vision of human rights.&nbsp; While accepting the concept of human rights, Singapore has disputed the interpretation and content of rights. &nbsp;For example, Minister Wong Kan Seng said at a 1993 UN human rights conference that Singaporeans did not accept pornography as free speech.&nbsp; A national body can help clarify the contours of rights by in-depth and contextualised consideration.&nbsp;Calling something a 'human right' does not make it so; an expert body can help develop guidelines to distinguish universal legal rights from narrow political claims, made in the name of human rights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore considers the amorphous right to development \"fundamental\".&nbsp; It could take the lead through a national <p align=left>Column: 1192 </p>expert body to concretise this right and make it \"measurable\", by developing indicia to determine whether socio-economic rights or welfare has been violated or realised.&nbsp; In so doing, it could underscore that this right goes beyond increasing GDP; individual welfare must be secured.&nbsp; The human right to development incorporates the need to ensure political participation in decision-making and equitable wealth distribution&nbsp;- &nbsp;these human rights standards help us evaluate the quality of the consultative process and Government policy in relation to social safety nets, as reflected in our public assistance schemes, Workfare, ComCare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, at the regional level, will Singapore take a leading or back-seat role in fleshing out the terse Charter provision which provides for the establishment of an ASEAN human rights body, without stipulating its form or nature?&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure something value-added, beyond lip service?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Charter aims to be people-centric, will non-Government bodies be involved in this process?&nbsp; Since the Charter does not identify any human rights standards, will Singapore seek a meaningful minimum, perhaps pegged to the UDHR or those UN treaties most ASEAN members are party to?&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of structure, realists are not expecting the sun and the moon in the form of a human rights court with compulsory jurisdiction, after the European model.&nbsp; However, would the Minister agree that the eventual body must not duplicate the UN state reporting process and must be something beyond a promotional talk-shop or think-tank?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it important that the body should have a protective function, perhaps allowing states and/or individuals a channel through which to raise concerns about alleged abuses before a<p align=left>Column: 1193 </p> supranational body, whether in public or private?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993, Minister Wong Kan Seng said that \"pragmatism and realism does not mean abdication.\" &nbsp;I hope not.&nbsp; The ASEAN Charter promises a human rights mechanism, but there is a gap between making and keeping promises.&nbsp; I am reminded of a line from a Robert Frost Poem: \"the woods are lovely dark and deep.&nbsp; But I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We look forward to the next step of ASEAN states to advance human rights and promote civilised governance, and we hope Singapore will take a leading role in this enterprise.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Can I ask the Minister to comment on Singapore's approach to climate change negotiations as well as Singapore's position on the Kyoto Protocol and what would be the landscape after 2012?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.&nbsp; I propose to take the break now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp; I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 2.50 pm.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"right\"><I>Sitting accordingly suspended</I></p><p align=\"right\"><I>at 2.30 pm until 2.50 pm.</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"center\"><i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Sitting resumed at</i> 2.50 pm</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"center\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"center\"><b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</b></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal\">Head&nbsp;N (cont.) -</i></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, let me first thank Members for the comments and questions on Singapore's foreign policy. With globalisation, the management of Singapore's external relations has become more important for our security and economic development. Last year, we hosted the ASEAN Summit. Next year, we will host the APEC Leaders' Meeting. It is good that on matters of foreign relations, all MPs, including Opposition MPs and NMPs, are generally in support of the Government. This is a great strength for us.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first talk about ASEAN, an important subject raised by Ms Indranee<p align=left>Column: 1202 </p> Rajah, Mr Michael Palmer, Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Hawazi Daipi and Ms Irene Ng.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last November's Summit was a success. It was auspicious for the ASEAN Charter to be signed at ASEAN&rsquo;s 40th Anniversary. It is a document which opens a new chapter in regional integration. At the Retreat of ASEAN Foreign Ministers in Sentosa last week, we agreed on a plan of action to implement the Charter. We had a smooth meeting which ended two hours ahead of schedule. There was a strong spirit of solidarity and common enterprise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the items to be followed up on is the drafting of provisions for a formal dispute settlement mechanism provided for in the Charter, and this will help us to create a systematic way for the resolution of disputes. While consensus is a general principle for decision making in ASEAN, it does not need to apply in all cases. Under the economic blueprint, for example, we do have provisions for &ldquo;10 minus X&rdquo; or &ldquo;two plus X&rdquo; involvement of member countries. The key here is that those who are not yet able to join in, should be able to join in when they are ready at a later point in time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the big issues, they should generally be resolved by consensus, but sometimes it is not possible when it involves a particular country which has been difficult. Take, for instance, the issue of Myanmar. The fact that we operate on a consensus principle did not prevent us in the past from calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. Members will remember that during the ASEAN Summit in Singapore after the informal dinner hosted by Prime Minister, nine leaders of ASEAN stood together to issue a statement on Myanmar, following the refusal of Myanmar&rsquo;s Prime Minister to agree to an ASEAN meeting with UN Special Envoy Gambari. So that statement was not a &ldquo;consensus statement&rdquo;. It was a &ldquo;minus one&rdquo; statement and it was a<p align=left>Column: 1203 </p> statement about the &ldquo;minus one&rdquo;. What I am saying is, yes, it is right that the general principle should be one of consensus decision making, but it need not apply in all cases and it has not applied in all cases. For the most important issues, the matter will be decided by the leaders operating as a committee of peers setting their own rules for decision making and over time, a certain wisdom develops.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Ministers agreed that the ASEAN Secretariat must be strengthened quickly. The new Secretary General, Dr Surin Pitsuwan, was authorised to recruit two Deputy Secretary Generals from 1st November this year. Dr Surin took over from Ong Keng Yong at the beginning of the year, and I must inform the House that Ong Keng Yong, one of our senior diplomats, did Singapore proud during his tenure as the Sec-Gen of ASEAN. To answer Dr Ong Chit Chung, we recognise that the Secretariat&rsquo;s budget has to be increased and have tasked senior officials to look into this on an urgent basis. To reduce the need for travel, ASEAN member countries will appoint ambassadors to the Secretariat in Jakarta from January next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the ASEAN Charter to come into force, all countries must ratify it and this is a point that I would like to make in reply to Mr Palmer. So far, four countries have done so: Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and Laos. The others should do so in the coming months. There could be a problem with the Philippines because the Congress has linked ratification to progress being made in the political situation in Myanmar. However, the Foreign Ministers were on the whole cautiously optimistic that the Philippines will not hold back the ratification of the ASEAN Charter. In fact, it is only after the Charter has come into force that we can hold the Myanmar Government to account, to the standards that it has signed on to, a point which Ms Irene Ng made. As for the Indonesian <p align=left>Column: 1204 </p>DPR, which Mr Palmer and Ms Ng doubted would ratify the Charter, I received this news from the German Foreign Minister just this morning. He came from Jakarta and we had a bilateral meeting just before I came to Parliament and he told me, and he said this to the media so this is something that I can divulge publicly, that Hassan Wirajuda told him that he expected the Indonesia DPR to ratify the Charter by June this year, so we do have reasons to be optimistic. The remaining problem I believe would be the Philippines but even from the Filipino viewpoint, it would be better to ratify the Charter and thereafter to hold the Myanmar government to account than not to do so, letting the Myanmar government off the hook.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of Myanmar was raised by Ms Indranee Rajah, Mr Michael Palmer, Ms Irene Ng, Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Hawazi Daipi. During the Retreat, the Myanmar Foreign Minister briefed us on the 7-step roadmap to democracy, which until the beginning of last month had no timeline. For the first time, the SPDC (State Peace and Development Council) Government announced that a referendum on a new constitution will be held in May and based on it, elections will be held in 2010, after which the reins of power will be handed over to the new government. Foreign Minister Nyan Win expected the draft constitution to be made public at the end of March. He also said that any citizen who has a foreign husband or children holding foreign passports will be disqualified from the elections. He informed us that this provision was in the 1974 Constitution and is not new.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although ASEAN Foreign Ministers saw the timetable as a positive development, we expressed a certain scepticism about the entire process because we have been disappointed so many times before in the past. The new Constitution was drafted without the<p align=left>Column: 1205 </p> participation of the NLD (National League for Democracy) and other groups. It is also unlikely that the SPDC Government will allow international verification of the voting process. ASEAN Foreign Ministers stressed the importance of independent verification for the referendum and elections to be credible. As for the disqualification of Aung San Suu Kyi from standing as a candidate for elections, ASEAN Foreign Ministers registered their dismay although some recognised that this was a decision for the people of Myanmar to make at the referendum. But whatever the constitution approved, provided it is a genuine referendum, it would represent a step forward because the people of Myanmar would then be able to express their views at the ballot box in 2010. Aung San Suu Kyi was not allowed to stand as a candidate in the 1990 elections, but that did not stop her party, the NLD, from achieving an overwhelming majority.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof.&nbsp;Thio Li-ann, Ms Irene Ng and Mr Michael Palmer raised the issue of human rights. The ASEAN Charter provides for a human rights body to be established, but the nature of that body has yet to be determined. Let me assure Dr Ong Chit Chung that it will not be a toothless paper tiger. At the Retreat last week, the Foreign Ministers agreed that officials will first meet to discuss the terms of reference for a panel of experts to draft the provisions for such a body. The terms of reference will be proposed for our consideration at the coming ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in July.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be sure, the human rights body will be a contentious subject. Some ASEAN countries prefer a body which has no teeth because there is justifiable concern that Western countries and NGOs will make use of it to interfere in their domestic politics. Others make the opposite argument, that a credible human<p align=left>Column: 1206 </p> rights body will help us address this issue on our own terms. It is precisely because of a lack of agreement among ASEAN countries that the human rights body was called a 'body' and not a 'commission'. My own guess is that we will have in the end a body which, while lacking in teeth, will at least have a tongue and a tongue will have its uses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof.&nbsp;Thio asked about Singapore's position on the ratification of certain UN human rights conventions with respect to migrant workers, torture, racial discrimination and other subjects, and whether it is not time to establish a National Human Rights Commission here. So far, Singapore has signed on the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We have not yet signed on the others because of reservations on some specific provisions such as corporal punishment and the death penalty. We will periodically review our position in the light of evolving international norms and practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not uncommon for countries to sign on these conventions while blithely ignoring their commitments in actual practice. We, on our part, take our commitments seriously and are therefore reluctant to commit to provisions</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>that we do not agree with fully.&nbsp; As for the National Human Rights Commission, it is not clear to us that the establishment of such bodies in a number of countries has made a significant difference to the human rights condition.&nbsp; Many countries without human rights commissions are able to maintain high standards of human rights like Singapore.&nbsp; In our case, we have provisions either in the Constitution or in statute to safeguard the rights of racial and religious minorities, women, children and workers, including migrant workers. &nbsp;They allow Singaporeans to enjoy a high degree of civil liberty and personal security in their daily lives.&nbsp; I know this is not a complete answer to&nbsp;Prof. Thio Li-<p align=left>Column: 1207 </p>ann who made quite an impassioned plea but some of the things she said really go beyond my remit as Foreign Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung, Ms Indranee Rajah, Mr Hawazi Daipi and Ms Irene Ng asked about the future of ASEAN and the challenges it faces. Let me break down my answers into the internal and external challenges which are related.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internally, we must keep pushing the integration of ASEAN so that we have an ASEAN Community of 550 million inhabitants with a sense of ASEAN citizenship by the year 2015.&nbsp; In addition to the Economic Blueprint which was signed last year, we need also the Political/Security Blueprint and the Social/Cultural Blueprint. There are many things we have to do in the public, private and people sectors.&nbsp; One specific problem we must continue to address is closing the developmental gap between the older and newer members. Happily, the Indo-Chinese countries are now making good economic progress. As for Myanmar, well, the key there is political reform, without which the economy will continue to flounder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Externally, the challenge for ASEAN is to engage all our major partners in a mutually-beneficial way so that all of them have a strong interest in our unity and well-being, and our own position in the world is naturally balanced. To achieve this, we must be fair and neutral to all our partners, ensure the freedom and security of the airways and the sealanes, and strengthen economic cooperation in all directions. In addition, we must press on with the regional construction especially ASEAN+3, EAS (East Asia Summit), APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) and ASEM (Asia Europe Meeting). We are also promoting ministerial links with regions farther away. With the Middle East, we have AMED <p align=left>Column: 1208</p>(Asia Middle East Dialogue) and a proposed ministerial meeting with the GCC (Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf) countries this year. With Latin America, we have FEALAC (Forum for East Asia and Latin America Cooperation) and a proposed ministerial meeting with MERCOSUR (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay), also this year. Now I mention all these abbreviations and acronyms not&nbsp;to befuddle you, but just to give you a sense of all the activities that we are engaged in to create a larger environment which is to our benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The key ingredient in this alphabet soup is our collective interest as ASEAN countries, and this we will strive to achieve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer Ms Indranee Rajah and Dr Ong Chit Chung, beyond ASEAN, APEC remains the most important regional organisation for us. Collectively, the 21 APEC economies make up more than half the world's GDP and trade. Among them are major powers like the US, Japan, China and Russia. Their good relations with one another determine whether this century is a peaceful one for us. The US-China relationship, in particular, is of decisive importance. Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about Cross-Strait relations between Mainland China and Taiwan. Although the outcome of the coming Presidential elections in Taiwan will have some impact on Cross-Strait relations, the critical factor is not Taiwanese domestic politics but US-China relations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the Mainland and Taiwan, and Hong Kong as well, are members of APEC which makes the organisation uniquely inclusive. But we must be clear that Taiwan and Hong Kong participate as economies, not as countries. And upon this clear understanding, there is growing support for the establishment of a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific in the long term. This is an important long range objective because the health of the multilateral trading system will increasing<p align=left>Column: 1209 </p>ly depend on the leadership of the economies in the Asia Pacific.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, Singapore will host the APEC Leaders Meeting which will be attended by new leaders from the US, Russia, Japan, Korea and Australia. It will be the most significant gathering of world leaders ever to be held in Singapore. We see the US remaining the leading player in the Asia Pacific for decades to come. To answer Ms Indranee Rajah, whether the next President is a Republican or a Democrat, whether it is McCain or Clinton or Obama, we do not see a major change in US policy towards Asia or in our bilateral relationship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi Daipi and Dr Ong Chit Chung spoke about our relations with Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.&nbsp; On the whole, we have excellent relations with all our ASEAN neighbours and all of them have significant numbers of their citizens working or studying in our country. &nbsp;We are grateful for their contributions to our society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our relations with Malaysia have been improving in the last two to three years. PM Lee had a very good retreat with PM Abdullah Badawi in Langkawi last May. We are now cooperating on the Iskandar Development Region through the Joint Ministerial Committee, with Malaysia setting the pace.&nbsp; Both sides see benefit in greater connectivity between Johor and Singapore, but I agree with Dr Ong that we can do more to promote greater friendship between our two peoples who indeed share so much in common.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Indranee Rajah, Mr Hawazi Daipi and Dr Ong Chit Chung were concerned that the judgment on Pedra Branca by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) might affect good relations between the two sides. I believe this will not happen because both sides have agreed for the <p align=left>Column: 1210 </p>dispute to be adjudicated by the ICJ. Indeed both governments have stated publicly more than once that they will abide by the judgment of the ICJ when it is made some time later this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Indonesia, bilateral relations remain strong although we were not able to see through the Extradition Treaty (ET) and the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) signed last year.&nbsp; Both sides have agreed to set aside the ET and DCA for the time being and I am happy to inform Ms Rajah and Dr Ong that both sides are also determined not to let this issue affect overall bilateral relations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like with Malaysia, Singapore has strong economic links with Indonesia. For example, we are each other's most important source of tourists. We continue to cooperate closely in many areas including the development of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in Batam, Bintan and Karimun, in fighting fires in Jambi, controlling bird flu in Tangerang and in rebuilding Aceh.&nbsp; The DPR has passed a law for the establishment of SEZs in Batam, Bintan and Karimun and a special council is being formed to oversee their development. We have a bilateral ministerial committee co-chaired by Indonesian Coordinating Minister Boediono and Minister Lim Hng Kiang to facilitate cooperation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung also asked about sand and the recent decision by Indonesian regulatory authorities on investments by Singapore in Indosat and in Telkomsel. So far as sand is concerned, to the extent that environmental damage is a problem, we are quite prepared to work with Indonesia and this offer remains on the table.&nbsp; But otherwise it is a decision for Indonesia to make and we respect whatever decision they make. &nbsp;Of course it is a waste that instead of sourcing sand from nearby, we have to import sand from further away, making it more expensive for us and leaving money<p align=left>Column:1211</p> on the table which both sides can share otherwise.&nbsp; As for the decision on Indosat and Telkomsel, this is a decision before Indonesian courts, and it is best that they be pursued through Indonesian legal channels. Indonesia ministers are well aware that the outcome of these two cases will affect the way foreign investors look at opportunities in Indonesia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked about the progress of the Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore Growth Triangle. This was in fact an idea first mooted by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong in 1989.&nbsp; Although we have not had meetings for many years, the time may be ripe to revive it, or to use Dr Ong&rsquo;s words, to revitalise it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the return of democratic government to Thailand, bilateral relations have been fully normalised. The new Thai Foreign Minister Noppadon Pattama made his first bilateral overseas visit to Singapore last week. It was a friendly gesture which we appreciated. We agreed that both the Civil Service Exchange Programme (CSEP) and the Singapore Thailand Enhanced Economic Relationship (STEER) should be restored at an early date.&nbsp; I have accepted Minister Noppadon's invitation to visit Bangkok for the next meeting of CSEP, the civil service exchange programme in the first half of this year. Members of this House will remember that the Thai side cancelled the last CSEP meeting and dis-invited me following the hosting of a private dinner by DPM Jayakumar for former Thai PM Thaksin.&nbsp; Minister Noppadon also encouraged Singapore companies to invest in Thailand assuring us of a more liberal investment environment. &nbsp;We are looking forward to the introductory visit of the new Thai PM Samak Sundaravej next month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's bilateral relations with Vietnam are growing from strength to strength. &nbsp;In fact, at this very moment, President Nathan is in Vietnam on a state<p align=left>Column: 1212 </p> visit and Prime Minister Lee has invited the General Secretary of Vietnam's Communist Party, Mr Nong Duc Manh, to visit Singapore this year. &nbsp;Singapore is a major source of FDI for Vietnam and bilateral trade between the two countries has been growing steadily. The Framework Agreement on Singapore-Vietnam Connectivity signed in November 2005 has facilitated several joint projects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Ms Indranee Rajah and Dr Ong Chit Chung that the three Northeast Asian countries of China, Japan and Korea are very important to us.&nbsp; Just last year, we celebrated the 10th Anniversary of ASEAN+3. &nbsp;The improvement in China-Japan relations has made the creation of an East Asian community easier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Ms Rajah and Dr Ong underlined the importance of our relations with China. &nbsp;Indeed bilateral relations have become much broader and deeper than they were in the past.&nbsp; The Joint Council on Bilateral Cooperation now covers a wide range of subjects.&nbsp; The official visit of Premier Wen Jiabao in November last year was very successful.&nbsp; During the visit, Premier Wen and PM Lee signed the agreement to develop an eco-city in Tianjin. &nbsp;This is a project comparable in significance to the Suzhou Industrial Park which was started in 1994.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than economic projects, our bilateral relations with China have become multi-layered and multi-faceted.&nbsp; Thousands of Singaporeans now work in China and tens of thousands of Chinese work in Singapore. &nbsp;There are now over 2,500 Chinese companies operating here and, each time I check, the number is higher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Singapore won the bid to host the first Youth Olympics, the Chinese Ambassador Zhang Xiaokang immediately wrote a letter to Prime Minister Lee offering China's assistance to us.&nbsp; We are touched by the gesture and will certainly take up the offer, for there is much that <p align=left>Column: 1213 </p>we can learn from China&rsquo;s own experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than any other country, Japan has played a critical role in integrating the economies of Southeast Asia. Our relations with Japan are excellent.&nbsp; During PM's official visit to Japan last March, the two sides agreed to establish a Japan Creative Centre in Singapore.&nbsp; Mediacorp has also worked with its Japanese counterparts to broadcast Japan Hour into the region.&nbsp; As we all know, Japan Hour has for years been one of the most popular docu-entertainment programmes on local television.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our relations with Korea are also very good. Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong has just made a successful visit to the country and had a warm meeting with the new President, Lee Myung-bak.&nbsp; Members of the House will be intrigued to hear that during the last presidential campaign, Singapore was often held up as a model for Korea. &nbsp;Senior Minister Goh also visited the Gaesong Industrial Park across the DMZ in North Korea.&nbsp; When our FTA with Korea was negotiated, we agreed to include Gaesong in order to promote economic development in North Korea.&nbsp; This provision was later incorporated into ASEAN's FTA with Korea.&nbsp; In May this year, I will be making an official visit to North Korea. &nbsp;At our recent Retreat, the ASEAN Foreign Ministers authorised me to propose that Pyongyang accede to ASEAN's Treaty of Amity and Cooperation.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's relations with India are bearing fruit. Our early support of India's economic reform policy has proved to be right. I share Ms Indranee Rajah's view that India is an important friend and partner. Indeed we see India as a major player, not only in Asia, but in the world. <p align=left>Column: 1214 </p>When Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee visited Singapore last June, we agreed that relations should be raised to a higher plane, beyond just economic cooperation. We have established a Joint Ministerial Committee which will meet every year. An India-Singapore Strategic Dialogue will have its inaugural session in May. We want India to take up its rightful position in our region and see it playing an important role in the East Asia Summit.&nbsp; Without the personal intervention of Foreign Minister Mukherjee and PM Manmohan Singh, the wonderful exhibition on Nalanda now going on at the ACM (Asian Civilisations Museum) could not have been put together. Singapore's defence links with India are also growing.&nbsp; An important agreement between the two air forces was signed last year, and other defence links are being explored.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Indranee Rajah asked for an update on our relations with Europe.&nbsp; They are, on the whole, excellent. Last November, we celebrated the 30th Anniversary of ASEAN-EU Dialogue Partnership. Although negotiations for an ASEAN-EU Free Trade Agreement have run into some difficulties, Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson is considering moving ahead earlier with countries which are ready. Singapore supports such flexibility provided the door is not shut on the other members of ASEAN.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The European Union is an inspiration to us in Singapore and an inspiration to us in ASEAN on how tribal nations locked for centuries in conflict are able to overcome historical differences to live in peace and address common challenges together. Singapore has been an ardent advocate of a stronger European presence in Southeast Asia, not only economic but also political and cultural. The current exhibition of 'Greek Masterpieces from the Louvre' at the National Museum, for example, has attracted many visitors.&nbsp; During PM Lee's recent visit to Paris, both sides agreed on a project to exhibit<p align=left>Column: 1215 </p> treasures from French museums in Singapore on a regular basis. European cultural institutes in Singapore like the Italian Cultural Institute and the German Goethe-Institute often organise film festivals and bring in theatre groups. As part of the 20th Anniversary celebration of the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9th November 2009, we will unveil a 16-foot stretch of the Wall with graffiti painting of two kings on one side at Bedok Reservoir. This powerful symbol of freedom is a long-term loan to us by an American couple, Robert and MeiLi Hefner. The German Ambassador and members of the German community in Singapore are helping us with this exciting project, among many others. The project is led by a group of young individuals from Youth Empire and has been keenly supported by local entertainers like Sheikh Haikel and Kumar. And I had a wonderful discussion with Minister Steinmeier just an hour ago at MFA about this project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki, Mr Hawazi and Mr Zainudin raised questions about our relations with the Middle East. It is becoming a new frontier for us full of opportunities although not without risk. In the last few years, our relations with countries in the Middle East have seen a sea change. High level bilateral visits have become commonplace, almost occurring every month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have stepped up our exchanges with all six countries of the GCC. Last month, negotiations for an FTA with the GCC were successfully concluded and this opens a new chapter in our relations with countries in the Gulf. Our companies are increasing their presence in that region and generally enjoy a good reputation. We are also working with the Middle East on third-country projects. For example, the Qatar Government partners Keppel in the development of the eco-city in Tianjin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Egypt is an old friend with whom we continue to maintain strong political links.<p align=left>Column: 1216 </p> I will be making an official visit to Cairo in April before attending the second AMED meeting in Sharm el Sheikh. AMED was an idea first mooted by Singapore and had its first meeting here in Singapore two years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with Libya, which I talked about last year, our relations with Tripoli have begun to flower. Mr Philip Yeo, Chairman of SPRING Singapore, was invited to be an international advisor to the Libyan EDB, which, curiously, is called EDB. Senior Minister Goh will be making an official visit to Libya this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin asked about the progress of the Middle East Institute. It has been established, chaired by Mr Lee Tzu Yang from Shell, and an international search for a director is being conducted. We have to recognise our own lack of knowledge about the history, culture and traditions of the Arab people, and the Middle East Institute will help us fill in our knowledge gaps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for people-to-people links, the Arab community in Singapore can help us re-establish our connections to that region. Last May, together with members of the Arab Association, I visited the Hadramaut in South Yemen where most of the Arabs in Southeast Asia came from originally.&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad who is Chairman of Parliament's Middle East Group and himself a Hadrami was in my delegation. The Hadramis are a remarkable people who make significant contributions to local communities wherever they settle. When Raffles governed Java from 1811 to 1815 during the Napoleonic War, he saw that in all the main towns of the East Indies, there were vibrant Hadrami trading communities. Understanding the role they played in the economy, one of the first actions he took after he founded Singapore in 1819 was to encourage Hadrami traders to settle here. He persuaded Syed Omar Aljunied from <p align=left>Column: 1217 </p>Palembang to relocate to Singapore (he was searching for \"foreign talent\") and it was Syed Omar who gave the name to the oldest mosque in Singapore and of course to my own GRC. My host in the Hadramaut, the Deputy Governor, is a great great great grandnephew of Syed Omar. During the lunch we had in Tarim, when many of our Arab friends were in <I>sarongs</I>, we had <I>sambal belacan</I>, I met close relatives of our Mufti and Habib Hassan. It was an Alkaff in Singapore who built the first road connecting the Hadramaut to the port of Mukalla, a road which is still used today. We have always been an important node in the international Arab network and will become one again in the 21st century, and Islamic banking will be only one aspect of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As pointed out by Ms Indranee Rajah, the issue of climate change will be on the global agenda for years to come. Following the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting in Bali last December, the nations of the world are now involved in negotiations for a post-2012 agreement to curb the emission of greenhouse gases into the earth's atmosphere. It is an agreement which must bring in all the major emitters including the US, China and India. Singapore has strong interests in these negotiations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the forests burn around Singapore, we will suffocate. If the sea level rises too much, we will be submerged. As a vulnerable small island state, we support international action to slow down global warming. We will work with other countries in ASEAN to promote sustainable management of forest resources and marine areas. We strongly support the Heart of Borneo project.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also ensure that the international agreement takes into<p align=left>Column: 1218</p> account our specific characteristics. As a sovereign city-state, we have to generate much of our own electricity which means, in our case, the burning of oil or natural gas. Other energy sources like wind, hydro, solar, geo-thermal and nuclear are either not available to us or not viable at this point in time and as a transportation hub, the many aircraft and ships which call here mean that we emit more carbon dioxide per capita than many other cities or countries.&nbsp; Instead of being penalised, we should receive credit because our role as an efficient hub in fact reduces total global emission. Like WTO, the control of emissions must take into account the different roles played by different economies and facilitate, not curb or distort, the efficient operation of markets. To ensure that our interests are safeguarded, we will work with countries which share characteristics similar to ours. We do not know how long it will take to negotiate a global agreement, which has to be a grand bargain. The UNFCCC hopes to conclude the agreement by the time of the Copenhagen meeting in December 2009, there being some urgency because the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol will run out at the end of 2012.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a modest way, Singapore has been breaking new ground in creating a liveable city and a sustainable habitat. Many foreign delegations come here to study what we have done in keeping the city clean and green, in waste management, water recycling, traffic control, conservation of forests, wetlands and marine life, and so on. For human civilisation to endure, human communities from the bottom up have to become much more sensitised to environmental concerns and these concerns have got to be internalised in individuals. The problem cannot be solved by governments acting alone. Climate change is a huge challenge for the whole world in this century. In anticipation of all this, MFA and other government agencies are building up our <p align=left>Column: 1219 </p>knowledge and capabilities. Ambassador Chew Tai Soo has been recalled from retirement and appointed our Chief Negotiator.&nbsp; Prof. Jayakumar chairs an inter-ministerial committee to oversee all our efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore is entering an exciting new phase in our national development. The internal and external challenges we face are intimately connected. Without the world in Singapore, there is no Singapore.&nbsp; We are only able to uplift the lives of our people and to build a sparkling 21st century city if the external circumstances remain favourable. This means continuing peace in the region, riding on the historic transformation of Asia and having a strong network of friends in the world.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>: We have some time left.

The difference though between the European Union and ASEAN is that, for Europe, a lot of unification took place&nbsp;under the Romans, the Pax Romana, followed then by a common religion, the Roman Catholic religion, which laid the foundation, if you like, for unification&nbsp;for closer integration.&nbsp; In ASEAN, where the countries have very different cultures, racial as well as religious backgrounds, the question is: is it possible, or does it look likely,&nbsp;that we will be able to achieve greater integration?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo:</B> Sir, I thank Ms Indranee Rajah for her thoughtful comparison between ASEAN and the EU. She is absolutely right that Europe is built on a common value system which has its roots in Rome, Greece, and Judeo-<p align=left>Column: 1220 </p>Christianity. So they are able to achieve a European Court to which all national courts are in the end subordinate. We do not have that same common history, and in fact ASEAN is marked by its diversity. The fact that we have such an admixture of religions and political systems, and historical connections, indicate that the founding basis of ASEAN cannot be the same as that of Europe. But we do share points of similarities. We face common challenges together and it is these challenges which are impelling us to work more closely together. For the coming years, there is still much to learn from the European experience, especially of the early Europe. Many of us in ASEAN do not see us ever becoming like the Europe of today, but we can certainly become the Europe of the Common Market, the Europe of the Economic Community.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</B> Sir, I wish to seek some clarifications from the Minister on Myanmar.&nbsp; Many of us feel that ASEAN has no teeth, but the&nbsp;Minister clearly thinks that ASEAN has a tongue.&nbsp; I would rather describe&nbsp;it as a&nbsp;tongue-in-cheek way of explaining how ASEAN deals with Myanmar.&nbsp; Because the Minister stated just now that nine other members of ASEAN issued a declaration on Myanmar at the last Summit.&nbsp; But what would the declaration do?&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Keng Yong, the distinguished former ASEAN Secretary-General, said that thousands of declarations had been issued by ASEAN.&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp; what concrete steps can ASEAN take to guide Myanmar on the right path?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo:</B> PM Lee issued a statement last November in the presence of eight other ASEAN leaders. Two important points were made. One, that ASEAN would not be held back by Myanmar. Two, even though Myanmar did not want us to be involved in the process of national reconciliation, we <p align=left>Column: 1221 </p>stood ready to help them when they want our help. They are members of the family and we cannot deny that. They are a strange member of the family and since they want more space, we have to give them more space. But when they decide to rejoin the rest of us, we should welcome them. That is the position that we are taking. We do not have the leverage which China has, because China has big interests in Myanmar. China is doing more than what is obvious to observers. Without China's intervention, it is unlikely that Gambari will be going back to Myanmar in early March. Without China's good offices, whether the timeline would have been announced, I do not know. But China has leverage, and also India which has a long border with Myanmar and deep historical connections with Myanmar, not forgetting that Burma was once part of the British Raj with India, and the biggest province. Both have leverage. We have little leverage. Thailand, which is ASEAN's neighbour with Myanmar, in fact depends on Myanmar's gas. So we must be completely realistic about what we can do and what we cannot do. We do not have real leverage but we do enjoy a certain moral authority. The fact that despite all our criticisms, they (Myanmar) turned up to sign on the Charter showed that we do matter to them.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</B> Sir, I would like to ask about the Growth Triangle.&nbsp; The Minister mentioned that it is time to revive it.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister how does he see the conditions have changed to make sure that this time it is&nbsp;a good try.&nbsp;&nbsp;From my understanding, previously, it had not taken off because the Indonesia-Malaysia leg is a weaker leg in the triangle.&nbsp; And for a long time, the parties had regarded each other as rivals rather than as partners.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister whether he thinks that if the Growth Triangle is revived, it means that the three <p align=left>Column: 1222 </p>countries are in a better position to leverage on each other's strengths, and to have the attitude of going forward as partners?&nbsp; As the Minister mentioned, we now have links with other parts of the world; the Middle East is working with us, growing with us and open to Singapore.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister whether he thinks that such an attitude prevails in this region?&nbsp; And, if not, how can we help the attitude be such that Singapore is seen as a partner and not a rival?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another question is on the ASEAN Charter.&nbsp; The Minister said that after the ASEAN Charter is ratified, ASEAN is in a better position to hold Myanmar to account.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister what he means by that?&nbsp; Does it mean still issuing strong statements and then standing helplessly by, as the statements are ignored?&nbsp; Or does it mean that there is something that ASEAN can do,&nbsp;a certain consensus that can be formed within the ASEAN members to perhaps take more punitive measures towards Myanmar?&nbsp; Is that door open?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, as I have said earlier to Dr Ong Chit Chung, we are in no position to punish Myanmar, because we have little leverage. We have some trade, some investments - and we regret having those investments - so it is not as if we supply them oil or arms or provide aid. But what we do enjoy is moral authority. I do not&nbsp;think the Myanmar ministers when they attend ASEAN meetings relish being interrogated by the rest of us. So there is moral pressure, and that moral pressure, I believe, does have some effect.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But going back to the Growth Triangle, for the opening dinner of our recent retreat, I took the ASEAN Foreign Ministers for a boat ride. In fact, we had the opening session on board. I wanted the Ministers to be away, leaving officials on land, so that we could be more focused. And indeed, it created a very <p align=left>Column: 1223 </p>good atmosphere, and many issues were resolved. Before the sun set, we could see the many ships in the Singapore Straits, and I was standing and having a drink with Pak Hassan Wirajuda from Indonesia, pointing out where the Riau Islands were: Bintan, Bulan, some of the oil tanks, Karimun and so on, and Malaysia. And it dawned upon us, how close we are. Over the centuries, these have always been part of one region. So if you look at the genealogical records of, say, the Johor Sultanate, they are linked to Riau, Lingga, Siak, Rokan and Indragiri, the waterways were the highways of the past. There is a very natural, organic basis for the Growth Triangle. Yes, for the time being, there are two legs which are stronger, but eventually the third leg will also become stronger, and I believe it is the wish of both Malaysia and Indonesia to strengthen the third leg, and it is in our interest to help them do so. When I met advisor to President SBY, Dr Syahrir, a few weeks ago,&nbsp;he mooted revitalising the Growth Triangle to me and I said we will support it and that if President SBY were to propose it to PM Lee, I am quite sure that PM Lee would also agree to the revival of the Growth Triangle. I believe PM Abdullah Badawi would take the same position.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Indranee Rajah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Indranee Rajah:</B> Sir, speaking about our relations with India, the Minister mentioned&nbsp;a joint ministerial committee.&nbsp; May I ask what would be the ambit of the joint ministerial committee, what it intends to do and what it hopes to achieve?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo:</B> No problems because there are very few problems to solve, but to survey the overall landscape together and to see whether there are new opportunities that we can exploit, new areas that we can work together on.

In fact, many things are being done by different ministries to build ASEAN into our common agenda. NGOs, think tanks, schools, and universities are all pursuing parallel efforts. The sense of ASEAN citizenship will take time to develop, what we want is little by little every year, a growing feeling that we are Southeast Asians. Last year, I had occasion to sit next to the&nbsp;Permanent Secretary of the British FCO. He was quite frank when he told me that even though he was actively involved in building Europe, he felt less European than his son; and that is what we should try to achieve - that our children will feel more, a greater sense of being ASEAN citizens than we feel. Up to now, it is more an elite construction, top-down; but we must increasingly grow it from the bottom-up. And as we confront problems together, sometimes opportunities arise in strange ways.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Israelis invaded southern Lebanon, a few Singaporeans were <p align=left>Column: 1225 </p>stranded in Beirut. At that time, southern Beirut was being heavily bombed, so we scrambled to evacuate them, got hold of the Americans, the Europeans and others. Later on, when ASEAN Ministers met, we compared notes, because all of us had citizens who were stranded in Beirut. Indonesia and Philippines had large numbers. So we said, \"Why don't we have a system to help each other? In the event that a country has no consular facility in that country, you can always go to another ASEAN Mission.\" Following that discussion, in fact, we crafted an agreement, and today that facility is open to all citizens of ASEAN. So if you are a Singaporean and you are in a tight spot in a country where there is no Singapore consulate, go to the nearest ASEAN consulate and they will help you.&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot guarantee the quality of service, but it is an agreement and if the service is not very good, then let me know and I will raise it again and bit by bit, we can become better as a group. But it is with opportunities like this that the sense of collective interest would grow.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Michael Palmer--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Michael Palmer:</B> Sir, I thank the Minister for his answers and clarifications.&nbsp; I just have one issue in relation to Dr Ong's point about the Charter having teeth.&nbsp; I was just&nbsp;wondering whether the Minister had a sense from other Foreign Ministers that if a member country of ASEAN came to a point where they did not recognise or did not comply with the obligations under the Charter, would ASEAN go to the extent of either suspending or expelling a country?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, we do not talk about such a possibility openly, but I am quite sure that Ministers and officials do consider this possibility in their own internal considerations. But let us push that hypothetical possibility, say, we expel <p align=left>Column: 1226 </p>Myanmar from ASEAN, rid ourselves of a problem. What happens? Myanmar is the buffer state between China and India. China has vast interests in Myanmar; India has vast interests in Myanmar. If it is not a member of ASEAN, both sides will have to create options for themselves in that country. And if there is internal discord, in self-defence, each will have to interfere to protect its own self-interests. So if China and India are dragged in, I think the Americans, the Japanese and the others will also be alarmed. In the end, Myanmar can become an arena for big power conflicts. At that point in time, our own interests will be dragged in too. So it would be better that we pinch our noses, and bear with the problem, and keep Myanmar within the ASEAN&nbsp; stable, than to come to the conclusion that jumping out from the frying pan will land us in a cooler situation.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Over the past few years, more than $9 billion worth of private&nbsp;investments have been put in at the Marina Bay area.&nbsp; Besides the new office places, like the BFC, which will come onstream from 2011 onwards, we will&nbsp;soon be seeing an integrated resort, high-end apartments, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Barrage, the rejuvenation of Collyer Quay and many other projects.&nbsp; This is in addition to the completed iconic Singapore Flyer, Esplanade and Fullerton Merlion Pier.&nbsp; This is an exciting prospect.&nbsp; It has been estimated that 50,000 people will be living&nbsp;and working in that vicinity.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Finance Minister has mentioned in his Budget Statement that there will be further developments at the Marina Bay in the next few years, and it will eventually double the size of our existing financial district.&nbsp; Would the Minister give an update on the development plans for Marina Bay, including the infrastructure to support upcoming and future developments?&nbsp; Beyond 2011, what is the Ministry's projection on the demand for office space at the Marina area?&nbsp; Will we have an over-supply situation of office&nbsp;and commercial spaces come 2011 and beyond?&nbsp; Also, what are MND's plans, if any, for the current Central Business Districts, like Raffles Place and Shenton Way, when the centre of gravity for the financial district is shifted to the Marina Bay?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the process of urban planning, the MND should <p align=left>Column: 1229</p>engage other relevant authorities and work closely with them so as to obtain optimum land use.&nbsp; The Finance Minister has also made special emphasis on the shortage of office space in Singapore.&nbsp; However, I have discovered that many sites near MRT stations which are suitable for offices are not fully utilised or developed.&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Hong Kong and Japan, many offices and commercial centres are built near the MRT stations, making full use of the land and optimising its economic values, while providing convenience to the people who commute by MRT to and from the office.&nbsp; In this way, precious time is saved and productivity is enhanced. The Toa Payoh HDB Hub is a very good example.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest that the MND consider using some of the land or sites near Newton Circus, Jurong East, Clementi and Hougang for building offices near the MRT stations to attain optimal land use.&nbsp; This would also help to divert some vehicular and human traffic to the suburban areas, alleviate the congestion in the city area and, at the same time, provide one-stop service for Singaporeans who go to work by MRT.&nbsp; This will encourage people to use public transport.<br></p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 1345-1346.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This led me to think about the future road traffic along Orchard Road and the role that public transportation has to play to manage the increased visitors and shoppers.&nbsp; It is already the most visited attraction in Singapore, attracting more than&nbsp;seven million visitors each year while thousands of local residents visit the areas for leisure or&nbsp;work each day.&nbsp; One of the critical success&nbsp;factors of Orchard Road is to make it even more pedestrian friendly and easy to access.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the initial master plan, I recall the proposal to have a comprehensive, integrated and seamless pedestrian walk network, including covered and open walk-ways, underground links as well as second-storey links between buildings.&nbsp; This will certainly facilitate inter-mall traffic without the use of passenger vehicles and, therefore, reducing the number of cars plying Orchard Road.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1231 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March 2004, a cash grant incentive was also introduced to help with the construction costs to create more underground links between selected buildings in Orchard Road.&nbsp; I would just like to know how successful is this incentive towards further development of user-friendly and convenience for users and visitors.&nbsp; Sir, I would also&nbsp;like to know whether the Ministry of National Development is keeping track of the number of connectivities that are planned or in place and whether it is sufficient to cater for the future needs and uses.&nbsp; Is the cash grant incentive still available and is it sufficient?&nbsp; Could we consider other incentives, for example, tax relief on cost of construction of these connectivities?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have seen some experiences in Hong Kong and Canada, and I would like to see such underground development where we connect buildings, such as a massive project,&nbsp;and there are F&amp;B connectivity and it is very convenient for the people.&nbsp;

Probably priceless.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We pride ourselves as a city garden, a garden in a city.&nbsp; The green living environment and green spaces in our urban landscape provide a good balance and form a vital part of our general well-being. With land prices escalating,&nbsp;some of these green spaces are fast disappearing, especially along our Orchard Road belt, giving way to new commercial and residential developments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government should actively enhance our living environment and&nbsp;working space with more&nbsp;green spaces so<p align=left>Column: 1232 </p> as to provide a conducive environment not only for Singaporeans&nbsp;but also for all who come to visit, work or play.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should allocate and preserve land just for more green spaces and we should actually&nbsp;actively do it especially in our quest towards a 6.5 million population in the future.&nbsp; I would like to ask the MND what percentages of the land in our HDB residential estates, CBD area and&nbsp; industrial estates are earmarked for green spaces and garden, and how&nbsp;these are preserved.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While MND builds gardens&nbsp;and green spaces, the Ministry should ensure and facilitate the accessibility of these green spaces to the people.

Take the example of this tree called&nbsp;Albizia in South Buona Vista Road.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixty-three Albizia trees in that area have been earmarked to be cut down after one such tree at the Bukit Batok Nature Park toppled and killed one passerby.&nbsp; Here, I <p align=left>Column: 1234 </p>would like to express my full sympathy to the family of the victim for this very unfortunate incident.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the incident, the authorities had initially decided that 63 Albizia trees in South Buona Vista Road were to be chopped down but, thanks to the efforts of residents there, only 13 of them&nbsp;which were found to pose real safety risk will now go.&nbsp; It is great that the&nbsp;Singapore Land Authority&nbsp;and the NParks are flexible and taking public feedback into account.&nbsp; So learning from this episode, I would urge that our authorities not to take the quick and easy way of felling trees without exploring and exhausting all the other options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third point is on keeping old and functional buildings.&nbsp; Sir, I am glad that the en bloc fever has cooled down somewhat.&nbsp; But I join the chorus of architects and concerned citizens about the way and pace in which Singapore is changing.&nbsp; In our urge to modernise, I fear that we might be inadvertently tearing down some things that we collectively hold dear.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Although this year, there may be some uncertainties, such as the declining US economy, our construction industry and service industry will continue to do well. A lot of manpower will be needed, and we may still have to depend on foreign workers.&nbsp; According to the report in the newspaper, even the coffee shops need to employ foreign workers to be the chefs and coffee shop assistants.&nbsp; I am wondering if the Government would build more dormitories for these foreign workers to stay in.<p><br> <p align=left>Column: 1236 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Ang Mo Kio where I live, a 4-room HDB flat can be rented out for as much as $1,900 per month and we can see some posters hanging on the lamp posts advertising for flats to let at between $1,700 and $2,000 per month.&nbsp; I asked the people how these flats can fetch such a high rental.&nbsp; They said, \"Oh, easy, you just rent it to the labour contractors.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; The contractors will tell the owner that they are accommodating&nbsp;three workers there. Next day,&nbsp;five workers will be staying there.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the landlord does not go there to check, the contractor will put in&nbsp;seven workers, and eventually about 30 workers will be put into one flat.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if more and more HDB flats are having more than 30 people living in each unit, would the safety and ambience of the neighbourhood be affected?&nbsp; Would it not threaten the safety of the people, particularly the women folk, when they&nbsp;come&nbsp;back home from work in the night?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how long it would take before more dormitories can be built to accommodate the ever-increasing number of foreign workers.&nbsp; At the same time, could there be more coordination between the HDB and MOM to find out how many foreign workers would be allowed to come in each year, so that the HDB would have enough time to build enough dormitories&nbsp;for these foreign workers?</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We had strong economic growth, with employment at a record high.&nbsp; Singapore captured global attention as we continued to transform ourselves into a cosmopolitan, vibrant and distinctive city.&nbsp; In fact, last month, we were listed among the top 20 global vibrant cities for the first time in the 2008 Hub Culture Zeitgeist Cities Ranking.&nbsp; I did not know the meaning of the word \"Zeitgeist\".&nbsp; So I looked it up in Wikipedia.<p align=left>Column: 1237 </p> It is a German word, that means \"spirit of the age\".&nbsp; So, basically, the Hub Culture Zeitgeist Cities Ranking is a ranking given to cities that, according to them, are places of innovation, places of change, places of vibrancy, all taken together to create a place of the moment.&nbsp; So we are one of the places of the moment.&nbsp; Let us hope that we will remain places of the moment for many, many moments to come.&nbsp; But, for 2008, we have for the first time got into the ranking, and these are just only one of the many accolades and commendations we received.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As many Members have pointed out, there are also many challenges because with success, come new challenges.&nbsp; With economic growth, cost pressures have gone up.&nbsp; Many Members have raised issues in the Budget debate and now about rising office rentals, housing prices, etc, and I will deal with these in detail.&nbsp; But I just want to say that even as we address immediate cost concerns, let us not lose sight of our longer-term development objective and focus.&nbsp; Our success today did not come by chance, but through persistent efforts over many years to remake Singapore into a distinctive global city.&nbsp; We have to continue to keep this long-term view and position our city well in the global competition for jobs, investments and talents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start with the longer-term development goals.&nbsp; The current cost challenges that we face are reflective of the pressures on our limited resources as our economy and population grow.&nbsp; Last year, the exuberance in the property market and the construction boom caused construction costs to spike up.&nbsp; And as a small economy, the worldwide increase in energy and food prices - we read yesterday that wheat prices have gone up 25%, just in one day alone - would have a direct immediate impact on us.&nbsp; And as<p align=left>Column: 1238 </p> we develop, these pressures are going to become more acute, not less.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, sustainable development must continue to be the key priority of the Government.&nbsp; The Government recently formed an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Sustainable Development, or IMCSD, to review policies and chart new strategies for Singapore's future development.&nbsp; The Committee is co-chaired by Minister Yaacob and myself and also includes members from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Transport.&nbsp; And this Committee will work closely with the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change which is chaired by Prof. Jayakumar.&nbsp; This is a strong signal of the commitment of Government to ensure that the growth we strive for is not at the expense of our quality of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many MPs have spoken on this issue of sustainable development during the Budget debate.&nbsp; Let me take this opportunity to articulate our philosophy and approach to sustainable development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term \"sustainable development\" came into vogue after a very important Commission introduced its report.&nbsp; This was the Brundtland Commission.&nbsp; And they published the report in 1987 called \"Our Common Future\", and this term was in that Report.&nbsp; Although the term had been used earlier, it was after this Report was published that the term \"sustainable development\" came into the vocabulary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when Singapore became independent in 1965, this phrase was not in the vocabulary.&nbsp; We had not heard of this phrase.&nbsp; But we adopted sustainable development principles right from the beginning, and we consistently practised these principles in the last 40 years of our development.&nbsp; Not by choice, but by necessity, because we are a city state with scarce resources and with no hinterland.&nbsp; We evolved our own \"Singapore Way\" of sustainable develop<p align=left>Column: 1239 </p>ment in the last 40 years, it served us well by achieving both economic growth and giving our people a good quality of life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Singapore Way is, first and foremost, about a good system of governance.&nbsp; Our sustainable development approach is founded on long-term comprehensive planning, and supported by a set of key policies and best practices and breakthrough innovations in technology.&nbsp; Few cities in the world have an integrated planning framework like ours, where technical agencies, across Ministries, come together to plan the land use and infrastructure needs of our development over a long-term horizon, over a few decades.&nbsp; This allows us to judiciously maximise every bit of our land resources.&nbsp; We have pioneered traffic demand management measures like the Vehicle Quota System and the Electronic Road Pricing system.&nbsp; We have planned self-sufficient townships to reduce the need to commute.&nbsp; We have achieved breakthroughs in waste and water management and developed NEWater to enhance our water security.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a total system approach that includes both software and hardware.&nbsp; In our own unique and holistic way, we have been able to achieve a liveable environment in the context of an economically vibrant, highly urbanised and densely populated city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Way is also a highly pragmatic approach to development, or \"pragmatic environmentalism\".&nbsp; We seek the most viable and cost-effective methods of achieving environmental sustainability outcomes.&nbsp; We focus on measures that are practical, effective and will make impactful contributions to environmental sustainability.&nbsp; Going forward, we will continue to experiment and make investment decisions in green technology, taking into account economic viability and effectiveness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1240 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, and this is related to pragmatism that I talked about, the Singapore Way is about achieving a sustainable and mutually reinforcing balance between development and environment.&nbsp; We need to remind ourselves that sustainable development is still about development, and that, at the core of the whole concept of sustainable development, is quality of life for our people.&nbsp; We still want growth.&nbsp; We still want good jobs.&nbsp; We want a better life for ourselves and our children.&nbsp; For the years ahead, we will have to do more to achieve greater resource efficiency to support our economic growth.&nbsp; We also need to ensure that our people have an excellent quality of life - that we can continue to breathe clean air, drink clean water, enjoy green places and spaces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that we will have to strive to achieve all our development objectives - economic growth, a good living environment, our environmental heritage - in a balanced way.&nbsp; So tough trade-offs between the needs of the economy and housing, between housing and conservation, between development and preservation of nature areas must continue to be made, especially in a small and resource-scarce city state like ours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also cannot forsake growth, as growth ensures that we have the resources to do even more for the environment.&nbsp; It is only with growth that Singapore will have sufficient resources to implement measures to undertake investments that will help us cut down on energy consumption or will help us to make use of the renewable energy, both of which will help to mitigate the impact of climate change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we want a virtuous cycle of economic growth and a high quality of the living environment supporting one another, not placing one objective in front of or at the expense of the other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1241 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, how do we make the next leap to become a leading eco-city in Asia?&nbsp; The key is partnership.&nbsp; An eco-city needs eco-residents.&nbsp; Sustainable development is as much about changing lifestyles as it is about new technologies or green buildings.&nbsp; We need to partner the private and the people sector to make fundamental changes to the way we live, work, play and commute at the level of individuals and businesses.&nbsp; So when I heard Mr Sam Tan talking just now about making more efforts to facilitate highest rate of recycling, I was encouraged because it is through such efforts, advocacy from MPs, from leaders in the community which are taken up by the people in the community that we will succeed in our efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am also happy to see the concrete efforts that are being made on energy audits and energy efficiency in the various CDCs.&nbsp; For example, Mayor Teo Ho Pin talked about the efforts made by North West CDC during the Budget debate.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The IMCSD also intends to co-create sustainable development strategy with the people and private sectors for the future by seeking the views and the expert knowledge that resides both locally as well as internationally.&nbsp; I expect that some of these discussions will reflect the inherent tensions between development and environment that face our resource-scarce state, whether it is between conservation, that Mr Sam Tan talked about, and development, or whether it is between conservation of buildings and conservation of green spaces, wooded areas, etc, or whether we need to set aside more<p align=left>Column: 1242 </p> space for housing.&nbsp; But I think this kind of discussion debate is essential to foster greater awareness of the challenges we face and greater ownership of the kinds of solutions that we are able to come up with to resolve these challenges, solutions that we have to come up with together.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am greatly encouraged by the various suggestions from Members about how we can further our sustainable development efforts.&nbsp; The IMCSD will study them carefully.&nbsp; In particular, Mr Edwin Khew asked whether we will be looking at encouraging environmental sustainability in our built environment, including public housing, and the answer is unequivocally yes.&nbsp; Apart from the broad strategies, the IMCSD will also look into specific new initiatives in various areas, such as in transport, in our built environment in promoting the green industry, in expanding green spaces to make Singapore the leading eco-global city in Asia.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Edwin Khew also asked whether the Government will be introducing more financial incentives to encourage environmentally-friendly practices.&nbsp; I do not preclude this.&nbsp; But the IMCSD needs to address sustainable development in a holistic way with a whole slew of measures, including public education, research and development, and, if necessary, legislation.&nbsp; The IMCSD intends to launch a blueprint next year that will provide a comprehensive roadmap of the initiatives and the measures that we need to take to sustain our development for the next 10 years and beyond.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as we do more domestically, we hope that we can share with other cities our model of sustainable development, and we have started with an important project that Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr George Yeo talked about just now, ie, the collaboration with China on the Sino-Singapore Eco-City Project in Tianjin.&nbsp; This is an important project and we hope that,<p align=left>Column: 1243 </p> through this project, we will be able to share with the Chinese authorities and the Tianjian authorities some of the development strategies and measures that we have taken and, at the same time, also learn from them some of the measures that they have taken.&nbsp; Together, we hope that we will be able to create and build an eco-city that we will be able to replicate in other cities, one that will be a viable model for other cities in China.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January this year, the UN biodiversity chief, Ahmed Djoghlaf, visited Singapore.&nbsp; He told me he was visiting Singapore for the first time and could never have imagined such greenness and nature co-existing in the heart of one of the most populated cities in the world.&nbsp; He encouraged us to share our strategies and programmes, especially in the greening of Singapore, with other urbanised, highly built-up cities around the world.&nbsp; We have promised that we will do so.&nbsp; So, we hope to share this model of sustainable development, a model that is economically and financially viable, replicable and addresses the needs of cities that are in a special environment, that is highly urbanised, densely populated and economically vibrant.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do that, I think one of the keys will be a land-use strategy that will help us in this effort.&nbsp; So we will continue to plan our land-use judiciously to ensure that we can grow comfortably into the future and yet provide an even higher quality of living environment for our people.&nbsp; In the next few months, MND and URA will roll out its land-use plans for the next 10 to 15 years in the Master Plan 2008.&nbsp; This Master Plan is a process that guides land-use planning for the next 10 to 15 years and it is a process that will engage and involve as many people as possible in developing this plan.&nbsp; We will develop this plan with three key objectives in mind:</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; To ensure that we have sufficient land to support economic growth;<br></p><p align=left>Column: 1244 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; To reduce commuting by bringing jobs closer to homes or, in some cases, homes closer to jobs; and</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; To provide greater greenery and leisure options for our people.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about plans to rejuvenate the CBD and to develop Marina Bay.&nbsp; To meet the future demand for Grade A office space, URA will be releasing land around the Tanjong Pagar precinct as well as redeveloping Ophir/Rochor corridor into a vibrant office cluster.&nbsp; So the existing CBD will not be forgotten.&nbsp; However, Marina Bay will remain the centrepiece of our new development efforts.&nbsp; It will be a seamless extension of Raffles Place, offer high-quality office spaces along a lively waterfront.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just give Members of its scale eventually, ie, the amount of space that will be generated within the area located immediately adjacent to the existing financial district at Raffles Place and Shenton Way.&nbsp; This new area will be equivalent to two Canary Wharfs.&nbsp; I think many of you are familiar with the Canary Wharf development in London.&nbsp; So in this new area, there is enough land set aside for two Canary Wharfs.&nbsp; It will provide as much Grade A office space as the whole of Hong Kong's Central.&nbsp; We are beginning to see the new financial district taking shape.&nbsp; We have the new development at One Raffles Quay (ORQ) and the Marina Bay Financial Centre, and we recently sold two new pieces of land at Marina View.&nbsp; These developments are beginning to reshape that particular area of Marina Bay.&nbsp; And URA will make available more sites for development in this area over the next five to six years, in line with market demand.&nbsp; When completed, these new developments will provide more than 1.1 million square metres of office space, in other words, as much office space as there is in total at Raffles Place today.&nbsp; The new financial district is expected to take more than 15 years to materialise,<p align=left>Column: 1245 </p> depending on market demand.&nbsp; The Government will continue to release land in a calibrated manner to meet such demand.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin Nordin asked about having more underground connectivity between buildings in the Orchard Road and downtown business area.&nbsp; I would like to inform him that the Marina Bay has been master planned as a pedestrian-friendly district.&nbsp; In other words, there will be extensive underground pedestrian networks, covered walkways at ground level, and all these will link all the developments in the area to the MRT stations in Marina Bay, at-grade as well as underground.&nbsp; For Orchard Road, URA plans to work with the private sector to achieve a comprehensive and seamless pedestrian network, including not only underground links, walkways at street level, but also second-storey links between buildings.&nbsp; This will require incentives and a lot of effort and persuasion on the part of the Government, but I believe it will be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think all of us agree that it is not sustainable for all economic activities to be focused in just the city centre alone.&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng specifically asked whether we can intensify land around MRT stations.&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp; Indeed, this has been a key planning policy of the Government.&nbsp; However, I hope Members will appreciate that not all MRT stations can be developed all at once.&nbsp; But land has been set aside for redevelopment into offices, commercial buildings and residential buildings.&nbsp; For example, there is already a vibrant cluster of office and commercial buildings that is coming up around the Novena and Tampines MRT stations.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the new Master Plan 2008 (MP08), we will be developing new commercial centres in three areas:<br></p><p align=left>Column: 1246 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Around the Jurong Lake area and the MRT station;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; In Paya Lebar; and<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; In the Kallang/Bugis area.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these three areas will help to complement the activities that are currently being undertaken in the city centre and will help to support our economic growth.&nbsp; These centres are all near existing developed areas, well-supported by road and rail infrastructure, and new industrial estates will also be created near these areas as well as other different regions.&nbsp; All these efforts, when completed, will make getting to work more convenient and cut down on commuting time.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third objective, out of the three objectives that I mentioned just now for the MP08, is to ensure a quality living environment.&nbsp; The MP08 will reflect improvements to our living environment.&nbsp; Members would have heard the Prime Minister in his National Day Rally Address talk about rejuvenation of our HDB estates through the remaking of Punggol 21 and the Dawson Road area.&nbsp; We will also be doing SERS in many of the other estates.&nbsp; We will be doing upgrading programmes, such as the Home Improvement Programme, Neighbourhood Renewal Programme, and of course the Lift Upgrading Programmes.</p><p align=\"center\"><br>&nbsp;<B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]<br></B></p><p></p><p>4.28 pm<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Fatimah Lateef suggested that we look into providing for retirement villages.&nbsp; As the Member may know, the Government provides elderly housing today in the form of Studio Apartments (SAs).&nbsp; Unlike retirement villages in other countries which are stand-alone retire<p align=left>Column: 1247 </p>ment villages, SAs are located within HDB estates.&nbsp; In fact, some of them are located in blocks that also contain other flat types.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because we want to allow the elderly to be integrated within the community.&nbsp; We want them to enjoy access to all the facilities that are available in the HDB estate, eg, the markets, shops, transportation, senior citizens corners, RC centres, etc.&nbsp; But at the same time, I just want to add that we have also set aside land for the private sector to develop private residences that can be purpose-built for the elderly.&nbsp; There is one such site at Jalan Jurong Kechil.&nbsp; The site comes with a shorter lease of 30 years.&nbsp; Why 30 years?&nbsp; It is because we have received feedback that a normal lease would be too expensive and will make it financially unattractive to build such retirement housing development.&nbsp; So we are trying out a 30-year short lease for this site and we will see whether the private sector is interested.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, the MP08 will include more recreational choices and destinations to improve the quality of life.&nbsp; There will be more water-based recreation, new sports facilities and lifestyle destinations.&nbsp; There will be new parks and enhancement to existing ones.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiak talked about park connectors.&nbsp; I would like to assure him that our park connectors will not lead to nowhere.&nbsp; In fact, we have stepped up our development of park connectors.&nbsp; We are going to develop 200 kilometres of these green corridors all over the island by 2015.&nbsp; This is double what we originally envisaged under the earlier Parks and Waterbodies Plan.&nbsp; These park connectors, as Dr Lim has alluded to, is really to connect up all the different parks all over the island in a network so that all parks eventually will be accessible to everybody, no matter where we are staying.&nbsp; So Pasir Ris Park can be accessible not just to residents of Pasir Ris, Tampines or Bedok but also to those in Marine Parade <p align=left>Column: 1248 </p>and even further beyond.&nbsp; Those living in the east will know that, in fact, the Eastern Park Connector has already been completed.&nbsp; The total length of that park connector is equivalent to the length of a marathon, ie, about 42 kilometres.&nbsp; In fact, in a few months' time, we are going to hold an ultra-marathon on this park connector.&nbsp; An ultra-marathon apparently is two marathons, so you run twice around the park connector.&nbsp; I think some of the Members here may be interested in an ultra-marathon on the Eastern Park Connector.&nbsp; But I would like to assure Dr Lim and everybody else that we are very serious about developing the park connector network because this is really one way to leverage on the parks and green spaces that we have and to create more accessibility for all.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But infrastructure, park connectors, etc, are not enough.&nbsp; We also need to have more programming.&nbsp; We need to create interest and bring people into the parks.&nbsp; We need to cater to their lifestyle interests.&nbsp; That is the reason why another programme that NParks has been actively promoting, which has started to gain traction and is becoming popular, is what they call the \"Community-in-Bloom\" programme.&nbsp; This programme is basically for the heartlands and has succeeded in promoting appreciation of gardening and greenery, developing a strong gardening culture and, in the process, also bonding people together in the heartlands.&nbsp; For those Members who have not started the \"Community-in-Bloom\" programme, I would heartily recommend it to you.<br></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.30 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also continue to safeguard our natural biodiversity and heritage. We have four natural reserves and 18 nature areas will be reflected in the Masterplan. Mr Sam Tan talked about mature trees. Yes, we have in place legislation, supported by development control measures, to protect <p align=left>Column: 1249 </p>trees within designated tree conservation areas along heritage roads and the roadside planting verges, and also in gazetted national parks and reserves. By doing this, by designating them as heritage trees, by prioritising developments, we hope that areas, which are not needed for development, will be kept undeveloped for as long as possible.&nbsp; But let me say that we cannot place trees and biodiversity above housing and other needs of our people.&nbsp; But through judicious planning and through sensitive development, we can share this limited space of ours with the birds and the trees, including our Albizia trees.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now turn to the other short-term challenges that we face.&nbsp; One immediate challenge is supply of office space and private residential property. Demand in these property sectors was very robust in 2007.&nbsp; There is a short-term office crunch, partly as a result of low office development activity in the 2002 to 2004 period when the market was down and when the private sector was hesitant in taking up sites that were actually made available by the Government and some of them were even converting office space to other uses.&nbsp; Then, in 2005 and 2006, there was a faster than expected rise in office demand. These two factors together contributed to the current shortage in office space.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2008 and 2009, the office market is expected to remain tight due to a continuing shortage of new office supply.&nbsp; However, in 2010 and beyond, some 1.4 million square metres of office space will be completed. 1.4 million square metres of office space is equivalent to about five years of supply on average based on the average demand in the last few years.&nbsp; So this is a longer term development - 2010 and beyond. In the shorter term, the Government has released land for transitional office sites as well as vacant<p align=left>Column: 1250 </p> State properties. This will yield about 150,000 square metres of office space. This transitional office space will be available within a year or so.&nbsp; The Government has also temporarily disallowed the conversion of office space in the central area to curb any further depreciation of the stock.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures are going to take some time to filter through to the market.&nbsp; I would suggest that, in the meantime, tenants can look outside the Central Area if they can. They can look at alternative locations.&nbsp; Office rentals vary very widely depending on location and development. We read about record office rentals in the headlines but this reflects the rentals for selected prime locations and Grade A developments. The median office rent in locations outside of the city centre, which&nbsp; accounts for 80% of office space in Singapore, is less than half that within the city centre.&nbsp; With more supply coming on-stream, increase in office rentals will be moderated over the next few years, and that is before taking into account any unforeseen circumstances arising from the sub-prime problems in the financial sector.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for private residential properties, the Government has responded to the price and rental increases by releasing more sites for residential development, more market information and withdrawn the deferred payment scheme to pre-empt speculative activities. The increase in prices and rentals have moderated towards the end of last year. And like office space, the prices and rentals for private residential properties also vary across market segments and geographical locations.&nbsp; So, by the end of 2007, fourth quarter last year, the median rent for non-landed private housing outside the Central Area was about half that for non-landed private housing in the Core Central Area, meaning districts 9, 10, 11, Sentosa and Downtown Core. I would like to inform Members that more supply is coming into the pipeline and this will moderate the <p align=left>Column: 1251 </p>price and rental increase over the next few years. As at fourth quarter 2007, there was a total supply of 65,000 uncompleted units of private housing. These are projects in the pipeline, out of which 56,000 units are expected to be completed between now and 2011, ie, in the next three years.&nbsp; To put that into perspective, the average demand for uncompleted units over the last few years was 11,000 units per annum.&nbsp; So, 56,000 units over the next three years is equivalent to five years' supply, if we took the last three years average.&nbsp; But I think the latest figures seem to suggest that the take-up rate is slowing down.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to monitor the property market closely and we will calibrate the office and private residential supply to be made available via the Government Land Sales programme.&nbsp; We will continue to take market-led approach, meaning, we will have the Confirmed List as well as the Reserve List.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now take one last point that was made by Mr Ong Ah Heng. He asked about supply of dormitory facilities for foreign workers. The demand for dormitory facilities has indeed increased very sharply and that comes on the back of big increase in the number of foreign workers needed for our economy.&nbsp; To take some of the heat out of the construction sector, the Government has deferred something like $3 billion worth of projects. So this will result in lesser demand for foreign workers which will also, of course, result in less pressure on dormitories.&nbsp; But there is a shortage of foreign worker dormitory housing at the moment. We have several options that we hope the industry will take up. We have got the dormitories within factory premises, we have purpose-built dormitories and we also have quarters which are provided within construction sites.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to release more sites for operators to build worker dormitories and <p align=left>Column: 1252 </p>this will require the successful tenderers to provide a range of amenities within the dormitory sites. Last year, BCA and JTC launched seven new dormitory sites which will provide close to 50,000 additional bed spaces. Here, I would like to appeal for Members' cooperation because you may find that one of the sites that we are going to release will be in your constituency and I hope you will understand why we have to release more sites for foreign worker housing.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by assuring Members that my Ministry will take concrete action to address these short-term challenges.&nbsp; At the same time, we have to stay on course.&nbsp; We have to persist with our efforts to develop Singapore into a vibrant and distinctive city in a sustainable way.<br></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong is not here.&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Affordable Public Housing</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</B> Sir, as a young girl, I always came across the story of the Matchbox Girl.&nbsp; And many a time, after reading, I would shed a tear.&nbsp; And recently, I read it in my son's Chinese textbook and the heart is still able to relate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two versions of the story - one with the child dying peacefully in the image of the warmth of her mother and the other dying in the cold, despite her persistent struggle for survival.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may ask: what has the story got to do with HDB affordable housing?&nbsp; I would relate the girl as the family in need, the state of mind she died with the roles of HDB which it chooses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who are the people who need affordable HDB housing? Divorced single parents with children, families who could<p align=left>Column: 1253 </p> not afford to maintain the present flat, newly-wed couples and upgraders.&nbsp; What are their choices?&nbsp; Only three - HDB sold flats, resale flats in market and rental flats.&nbsp; I would just go into the first two categories of families in need. What kind of role HDB is playing? Going back to the Matchbox story and relating to the family in need, the image of the family warmth or the harshness of the cold world?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For families in need, resale flats are out of the question in the current market as the cash value asked by the seller is at least $10,000 for a three-room resale flat.&nbsp; I have a divorcee who comes and sees me three times already, with a young child about eight years old and an aged mother. She rented a flat and has shifted twice along Lorong Ah Soo.&nbsp; Her latest HDB landlord has increased rents three times, from $800 to $1,000 and the latest increase is to $1,300.&nbsp; Her concern is her son who goes to the nearby school and she has to stick around that area. Her pay is only $1,600 and her take-home pay would just slightly be above $1,300 and she would have nothing left after paying the rental. She is presently digging into her savings.&nbsp; But how long can she last? She told me she cannot afford the $10,000 cash value for the resale flat. Hence, she has to come and see me to appeal for rental flats persistently.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other alternative - purchase from HDB direct. She cannot afford to wait for the long queue and then the construction period of at least two years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rental flats - HDB informed us that there is high demand now. There is a need to control the demand, hence, to determine who is more deserving. This approach is like the cold wind which blows out the light of the last match stick the little girl holds.&nbsp; Let me ask the Ministry: who deserves the rental flats? What are the criteria? What is the demand for rental flats now? What is the current <p align=left>Column: 1254 </p>supply? What is MND's assessment of the demand&nbsp;for rental flats in 5-10 years' time? What are&nbsp;its planning parameters on the quantum of rental flats versus sold flats for the HDB in the next five years and in the long term?&nbsp; Is there a need to change the planning parameters? As the needs are now more varied,&nbsp;many cannot go into the flat queue as many have transacted at least twice, or have taken HDB loans twice, partly their mistake and partly MND's, as there was no control until much later.&nbsp; Can HDB have more rental flats at market value for them to choose the&nbsp;range of their rental pricing in the market, not at subsidised rate of $30 and $50 rental flats?&nbsp; Can HDB provide staggered subsidies and provide rental flats in the price range of $300, $500 and $800?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB can set the criteria. At least, many more families can be basically housed and properly housed.&nbsp; Alternatively,&nbsp;provide these families in need, especially the divorcee with family and the downgraders, the assistance to buy the smaller ready flats or the HDB's buy-back three-room flats.&nbsp; I understand HDB has a&nbsp;very low stock now.&nbsp; Are they going to continue? We have been calling for many years for HDB to&nbsp;provide downgraders the necessary HDB loan to buy the three-room flats.&nbsp; HDB is simply forcing this group of downgraders to go to the rental flats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings&nbsp;to&nbsp;mind&nbsp;the supply and demand of HDB sold flats.&nbsp; HDB has&nbsp;40 years of providing flats.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman:</B>&nbsp;Order.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak:</B> Sir, I have the privilege of staying in an HDB flat for about 17 years of my life.&nbsp; I think many of the Members in this House also have the privilege of staying in an HDB flat.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some of the Members may not have the privilege of staying in HDB flats because their parents' incomes were too high.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1255</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB living is a way of life for many Singaporeans.&nbsp; And HDB living actually, in a way, represents Singapore.&nbsp; It is a melting pot where all races come together.

Over the past few months, the issue of middle income squeeze has reared itself once again.&nbsp; The media reported a DBSS project known as \"City View\"&nbsp;with its eye-popping $750,000 for its most expensive units.&nbsp; While the developer clarified that only a few units&nbsp;command such a price, it does the raise the question: to what extent&nbsp;are such examples of \"public housing\" truly public?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is hardly an isolated instance.&nbsp; The newspapers are also replete with examples of HDB resale flats hitting new records - at Queensway, Marine Parade and elsewhere.&nbsp; The sky-rocketing public housing flat prices together with the long<p align=left>Column: 1257 </p> queues and over subscriptions that result each time a new batch of flats is released for sale further heightens the anxiety of potential flat buyers.&nbsp; The basic problem is the mismatch between demand and supply.&nbsp; While such dislocations may be short term and temporary, the frustrations felt, especially by newly-weds, is palpable.&nbsp; Besides the BTO programme and the walk-in selection exercise, I would like to urge the Minister to consider other measures to ensure smoother adjustments to the market, as well as ensure that HDB flat prices remain affordable for the low and middle income segments of the population that it is to serve.&nbsp; For instance, making the HDB market more transparent by releasing information about the potential supply of HDB flats, their locations and numbers, say, on an annual basis, could relieve the anxiety of potential flat buyers about inadequate supply as well as to help them to plan ahead.&nbsp; There could even be some kind of reserve list for some of these BTO projects, so that a project may be triggered when it receives the requisite percentage of applications.&nbsp; This would be more responsive to demand than the current practice of announcing the project just before it is launched.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to urge the HDB to be judicious in launching DBSS projects, so as not to detract from its key mission of providing affordable housing to the vast majority&nbsp;of low and middle income earners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to ask the Ministry if the HDB takes into account the prices achieved for DBSS flats, like it takes into account resale flat prices in determining the prices of its new flats, and how regularly the HDB reviews the prices of its new flats for sale.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Sir, as Dr Lim Wee Kiak said just now, HDB is a way of life for many Singaporeans.&nbsp; In fact, our home ownership programme has enabled many Singaporeans, including many Members in this House, to partake or be part of the HDB way of life, and to share in the nation's economic progress.&nbsp; In fact, it is a safety net for many HDB flat owners who are largely unaffected by the rising rentals in the property market.&nbsp; They are actually able to benefit from being able to sell or to sublet their flats at higher prices, and HDB flat prices have been going up in tandem with economic growth as a result of Government's extensive efforts in upgrading and rejuvenating the older estates.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I realise that while rising flat prices may be a comfort to the vast majority of HDB flat owners, it is a source of concern for many Singaporeans, especially the younger Singaporeans who are looking forward to joining the ranks of home owners.&nbsp; Last year, HDB flat prices rose by about 17%.&nbsp; I do not expect that the HDB resale flat prices are going to continue with this heavy growth this year.&nbsp; It is not realistic, neither is it healthy.&nbsp; 2007 was an exceptional year for the Singapore economy which grew by 7.7%.&nbsp; In fact, HDB flat prices were playing catch up with the rest of the market.&nbsp; And in the preceding three years, HDB flat prices had hardly moved at all.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking ahead, economic uncertainty is likely to moderate the growth in property prices, including resale prices.&nbsp; The HDB Resale Price Index grew by 1% in January, and I expect prices to grow at a more moderate pace for the whole of 2008.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure all Singaporeans, especially young couples who are seeking to buy their first homes, that the Government remains committed to ensuring that HDB flats remain affordable.&nbsp; This is not an empty promise.&nbsp; It is a <p align=left>Column: 1259</p>commitment that has cost the Government, on average, $1.4 billion per year over the last five years.&nbsp; And in the FY 2008 Budget, a sum of $1.6 billion has been allocated for the public housing budget.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We keep HDB flats affordable by giving first-time buyers a generous housing subsidy.&nbsp; Either they choose to buy a new flat, in which case they are sold a flat which is below the market price, which they can then resell five years later and make a profit.&nbsp; If they choose to buy a resale flat, they can enjoy a CPF housing grant of $30,000-$40,000.&nbsp; Again, after five years, they can choose to sell it and make a profit.&nbsp; If their monthly income is below $4,000, they can get an additional CPF housing grant of up to $30,000 to buy a new or resale flat.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if we take the CPF housing grant of $30,000-$40,000 plus the additional housing grant of $30,000, we are talking about a subsidy of $60,000 to $70,000 to buy a flat.&nbsp; That is the extent of the subsidy that a first-time buyer is getting.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For new flats, there is always this question: how are we pricing new flats, and this was what Dr Amy Khor asked?&nbsp; There is a very basic principle involved. The pricing of new flats is pegged to the market values of equivalent resale flats, ie, flats that are in the same locality, taking into account differences in the design, storey height, remaining lease, etc.&nbsp; So, when we are pricing a new flat in, say, Punggol or Sengkang, we will look at the transactions of equivalent flats in Punggol and Sengkang.&nbsp; We do not look at prices elsewhere.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the same methodology that is adopted by professional valuers that is used for the valuation of other properties in the market.&nbsp; I do not need to tell Dr Amy Khor this, because she is more qualified than I am in this area.&nbsp; After setting the market price, HDB then sets the selling price below the equivalent<p align=left>Column: 1260 </p> market value.&nbsp; So, the gap between the market value and the HDB selling price is the subsidy that the person enjoys.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To allay her concerns, when the valuers look at the valuation of the equivalent flats in the area, they take out what they call the \"outliers\", the very high prices and the very low prices.&nbsp; For example, if HDB is selling new flats in Boon Keng it does not take into account the flat prices that are set, say, under DBSS, because that is a different kind of flats which I will go into detail later.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On top of the upfront subsidy, HDB also offers subsidised mortgage loans at concessionary interest rates.&nbsp; I think Members may not realise how much subsidy is captured in the concessionary loan.&nbsp; Just to give Members an idea, if a buyer takes a $200,000 loan over 30 years, the amount of subsidy built into this loan is about $20,000 at current market interest rates.&nbsp; So, a first-timer buying, say, a resale flat with below $4,000 monthly household income, would be getting $30,000-$40,000 upfront CPF housing grant, up to $30,000 in additional housing grant and another $20,000 in the subsidy grant.&nbsp; And if we take all these together, first-time flat buyers can enjoy as much as $88,000 in housing subsidies from the Government.&nbsp; As a result of all these subsidies, first-timers who purchase new flats from HDB - and I am talking about real numbers here as I am looking at data from last year - on average, around 20% of their monthly household income was used to service their housing loans.&nbsp; So we took all the samples of all the first-timers who bought flats last year, and we checked their mortgage payments against their household income.&nbsp; On average, they used 20% of their monthly household income to service their housing loans.&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; This means that those flat buyers, at least 70% of them, could service their housing loans entirely from their CPF contributions.&nbsp; In <p align=left>Column: 1261 </p>other words, they would not need to come out with any cash at all.&nbsp; It can all come from the household&rsquo;s monthly contribution to the CPF Board.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 20% figure is significant because a 30% debt service ratio is generally considered acceptable for affordability.&nbsp; In other words, if the debt service ratio is below 30%, then that is considered affordable.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, here we are talking about, on average, a debt service ratio of 20% for the whole of 2007 when prices were considered to be on the high side.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the resale flat market?&nbsp; While flat prices have been rising, affordability has also been within acceptable levels.&nbsp; Let me talk of specific numbers again.&nbsp; A 4-room flat was selling for about $270,000 in the last quarter of 2007.&nbsp; Again, I am taking the peak.&nbsp; I am not taking the earlier part of the year when prices were lower.&nbsp; I am looking at peak prices.&nbsp; A household earning $4,000 a month would have enjoyed housing subsidies of up to $45,000 - CPF housing grant $40,000, additional housing grant $5,000.&nbsp; To service his HDB concessionary loan, he would need to pay $800 a month.&nbsp; $800 over $4,000 is 20%.&nbsp; And, again, like the other example I cited, he can do so through his CPF with zero cash outlay every month.&nbsp; This is a resale flat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our public housing subsidies are generous by any standard.&nbsp; Recently, a journalist, Christine Lee Min Wen, who works in <I>Wobao</I>, wrote about her experience in purchasing a flat.&nbsp; Min Wen had interviewed me last year.&nbsp; In the interview, she gave me an earful about the concerns of her readers who could not get a new flat of their choice.&nbsp; So I took the opportunity of the interview to advise her readers - widen your options, look for resale flats instead or look for flats outside the mature areas.&nbsp; Little did I know<p align=left>Column: 1262 </p> that she was one of those who was affected by this.&nbsp; She herself was actually looking for a flat.&nbsp; So I was very pleasantly surprised to read that she had indeed followed my advice and she had managed to buy herself a flat in Toa Payoh within her budget, no COV.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the article, and allow me to quote her, it says <I>bu yao mang yu jie jue fang shi</I>.&nbsp; Those who understand Mandarin, it is not that kind of <I>fang shi</I>, it is <I>fang wu de shi qing, bu shi fang jian de shi qing</I>.&nbsp; So she said in this article, \"actually if we compare ourselves with other densely populated cities like Hong Kong, like London, Singaporeans are already very lucky to be able to own their own homes.&nbsp; In many of these places, the people have to rent a place for a few years and sometimes for more than a decade before they can save enough money to buy their own place.\"</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since our housing subsidies are so generous, should we now allow more people to benefit from it?&nbsp; Several Members, Dr Lim Wee Kiak just now and Mr Christopher de Souza, I believe, during the Budget debate, suggested that HDB raised the income ceiling for housing subsidies to help those earning above $8,000 per month.&nbsp; Mr de Souza, for example, said that buyers who are beyond the $8,000 income ceiling are denied access to affordable housing.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the current income ceiling of $8,000 - what does this mean?&nbsp; It means that about eight in ten Singaporean families are eligible to buy subsidised public housing.&nbsp; In other words, public housing subsidies are benefiting not just the low income, not even, I submit, the middle income but have reached the upper middle income, the 80th percentile of Singaporeans.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I hope Members will agree with me that this is more than generous and will not be surprised if I tell them that HDB <p align=left>Column: 1263 </p>has no plans to revise the household income ceiling.&nbsp; However, as Members are aware, HDB does exercise flexibility and it does consider appeals that merit special consideration.&nbsp; For example, if somebody just exceeds that household income ceiling, has special financial difficulties or medical problems, etc, such cases are looked at favourably.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For households exceeding the income ceiling, there are many other housing options, including the purchase of resale HDB flats that I talked about just now.&nbsp; And, in fact, if your income is up to $10,000, you can still get a CPF housing grant if you buy a new Executive Condominium (EC).&nbsp; There are many examples I can give but this is just one of them.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked my staff to show me some examples of what they meant by affordable housing options.&nbsp; So somebody with $8,500 per month, what can he afford?&nbsp; They worked the sums out.&nbsp; He could buy a resale executive flat and his debt service ratio would work out to something like 20%, to be exact, 21%.&nbsp; Again, that is well within the debt service ratio that one would consider to be reasonable or affordable.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Subsidies\", by definition, are to help those in need and I think the principle that we give more help to those who need it more is generally well accepted by everybody and that is the reason why the Government introduced the Additional CPF Housing Grant a few years ago and enhanced it last year, to help the lower income households to step up into home ownership.&nbsp; I believe this targeted approach to disbursing housing subsidies will bring more benefits to more people and it will achieve the objective that we set out for ourselves for the public housing programme.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to some other concerns that have been raised - for a<p align=left>Column: 1264 </p> start, the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS).&nbsp; Why did we introduce the DBSS in 2005?&nbsp; Public housing caters to a whole range of people, from those earning up to $1,500 for which we have one- and two-room rental flats.&nbsp; We also have home ownership flats - two-room flats or three-room flats for those earning up to $2,000 to $3,000, and bigger flats all the way up to the $8,000 household.&nbsp; Within the vast group earning up to $8,000, there is a whole range of households with different aspirations who want different finishes, different features.&nbsp; There are those willing to pay more for public housing units and so we decided to experiment with a new type of housing that is not built by HDB but by the private sector.&nbsp; But we made it very clear that this new type of flats will continue to be for those who are eligible for public housing.&nbsp; That is how the DBSS experiment started.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started off with one project in Tampines that was overwhelmingly successful.&nbsp; We tried another project in Boon Keng, again the same thing.&nbsp; Because of the response, we think that there is room for more of such DBSS developments but not to the extent of normal HDB flats.&nbsp; So there is a niche demand. This is a niche product that will cater to the needs of a small group of people.&nbsp; But it is important in the whole range, in the whole gamut of options, that we do provide such an option to make the public housing programme in Singapore not just about basic housing, but something that will fulfil the aspirations of young Singaporeans.&nbsp; So three more DBSS sites will be released this year and altogether we will have seven DBSS sites with a total yield 4,000 units.&nbsp; To put the numbers in perspective, less than 1% of the over 800,000 public housing units will be DBSS.&nbsp; I would like to reassure Members that HDB-built flats will continue to be the mainstay of new flat supply.&nbsp; This is similar to the ECs that we built.&nbsp; DBSS flats will become another niche<p align=left>Column: 1265 </p> market for buyers that can afford to pay higher prices for public housing, with different designs and different features.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is this whole range of options, and I would like to suggest to Members that if there are people who complained to you about not being able to afford DBSS, please tell them that there are many other options available.&nbsp; But at the same time, there are some of your residents who welcome such public housing, as seen by the responses to the last two projects.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor also asked about the high prices of the DBSS flats.&nbsp; These prices are set by the private sector but the control that we have is that we will limit the type of people who will buy these DBSS flats.&nbsp; We will limit them by household income ceiling.&nbsp; And that is the reason why in response to a question earlier when somebody asked, \"Why don't you lift the income ceiling from $8,000 to $10,000 for DBSS?\"&nbsp; I said, no, because that is only going to make the prices go up even further.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it will simply mean that there will be a bigger catchment of buyers for those flats.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So by limiting the catchment, by imposing certain conditions like ethnic integration, ethnic quotas, by requiring a minimum five-year occupation period and so forth, we specifically target the HDB flat buyer but at the same time we give him a higher featured option.&nbsp; In this way, we roll out different types of flats for different buyers.&nbsp; We have flats for the lower income, we are building new 2-room flats.&nbsp; We have restarted that programme.&nbsp; We are building new 3-room flats, and we will build 4-room flats and 5-room flats, and now DBSS flats.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been a lot of concern by Members about mismatch of supply and demand.&nbsp; Why are we short of flats now?&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1266 </p> Why do we not build more?&nbsp; Why did HDB wait so long to roll out more new flats and so on?&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me address these by first of all taking us back a few years ago to the nineties.&nbsp; At that time HDB flats were sold through the Registration for Flats System or the RFS system.&nbsp; Under this RFS system, flat buyers would queue up and, based on the number in the queue, we would then start to build those flats.&nbsp; The key assumption then was that the queue represented real demand.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this was not the case.&nbsp; When the property market took a dive in 1997, many of those who were in the queue, who said that \"yes, we want the flat\", changed their minds and the queue disappeared overnight.&nbsp; As a result, 20,000 flats - some newly completed, others under construction - were left without takers.&nbsp; HDB was criticised both in and out of this House for over-estimating the demand and for wasting public resources.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB took several years to clear the stock of unsold flats.&nbsp; Even now, we still have some of that stock.&nbsp; Learning from this experience, HDB replaced the RFS with the current Build-To-Order (BTO) system in 2001 so that it can better respond to the changing demand patterns for new flats.&nbsp; The BTO system means that you build flats only when there is real demand for it.&nbsp; Real demand means that you actually come, not only indicate that you want to buy a flat but also put your deposit down.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are once again witnessing strong housing demand in the midst, another uptrend in the property cycle.&nbsp; It is not clear how long this cycle will last - two to three years - nobody knows.&nbsp; But the Government remains committed to providing affordable quality housing for Singaporeans.&nbsp; We must however understand that there are different housing needs and we have to try to satisfy them in different ways.&nbsp; Some needs are more urgent than others; some needs are more <p align=left>Column: 1267 </p>basic than others, and we must not repeat the mistake of trying to build a new flat for everybody who comes to HDB for a flat.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The perception that there is a housing shortage arises from the large overwhelming number of applications received in the last few sales exercises.&nbsp; But these exercises are for a very small number of very highly prized flats in established new towns like Bukit Merah.&nbsp; Two hundred and seventy-eight flats were offered last month, most of them ready, in good locations and at good prices.&nbsp; Ten thousand people applied.&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp; Because these are very, very attractive flats.&nbsp; The fact of the matter is that HDB is not able to offer 10,000 new flats in established new towns.&nbsp; There is simply not enough land for new public housing developments in this area.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What HDB can do is to rejuvenate old estates, intensify use of land in certain areas and introduce as a result new flats for sale, but there is a limit to how many units HDB can develop in these established towns.&nbsp; The good news is that while the supply of new flats in established towns is small, there is no shortage of new flats in the new towns like Punggol and Sengkang.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB has been stepping up its Build-To-Order (BTO) launches last year and this year - 6,000 BTO flats last year, 4,500 BTO flats in the first half of 2008.&nbsp; In fact, a few days ago HDB launched its latest BTO project, almost 500 flats in Punggol. We will launch more BTO projects in the new estates with the requirement that a good majority of flats are booked before HDB proceeds to build.&nbsp; HDB is mindful of not overbuilding new flats over the long term.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you over-build now, you may make the people who are buying the flats happy today. But those who have bought the new flats today will want to sell those flats one day, they will find themselves unable to sell their flats on the resale<p align=left>Column: 1268 </p> market if there is an over-supply of flats in the market.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to highlight that for the BTO projects in Punggol and Sengkang that we launched last year, there are still 700 units that are not booked and are available.&nbsp;&nbsp; So while applicants are saying that there is a shortage of flats, there are still 700 units available in Punggol and Sengkang.&nbsp; So let me assure Members that there are sufficient flats available.&nbsp; These are available in well-built estates, well-located estates, with good amenities like Punggol, like Sengkang.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

But I would like to advise them, please either look for a new flat, if they can wait, in the non-mature estates, in the new estates, or look for a flat in a resale market and make use of the CPF housing grant.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If they choose to opt to purchase a new flat under HDB BTO exercise, we will give them priority over other applicants.&nbsp; But when I talk about priority here, I am not talking about them at the head of the queue because we do not have the queue anymore, but by giving them more chances in the ballot.&nbsp; So if you are a first-timer, you will get two tickets.&nbsp; If you apply for flats near your parents, you will get another two tickets.&nbsp; So you will get four tickets.&nbsp; And this will increase your chances.&nbsp; Of course, it will not guarantee that you will get a flat.&nbsp; But it will increase your chances.&nbsp; And 90% of new HDB flats will be reserved for first timers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Amy Khor suggested that HDB be more transparent about the timing and location of its sale programmes.&nbsp; This is to allow buyers to plan ahead.&nbsp; Yes, that is a good idea.&nbsp; In fact, HDB has over the years<p align=left>Column: 1269 </p> made public its sale programmes but in broad terms.&nbsp; Specifically, HDB has announced that it will offer 4,500 BTO flats in the first half of this year and that BTO flats will be launched in Sengkang and Punggol to build up the critical mass in these two new towns.&nbsp; So while we cannot pinpoint the exact timing and the location of which BTO launch, flat buyers can expect to see at least one project per quarter in these new towns - Punggol and Sengkang - in the next two years.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another piece of advice in case young couples are not aware is that if they really want to minimise their waiting time, they can also apply under the Fiance-Fiancee Scheme.&nbsp; Again, this will help to cut down on the waiting time.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I would like to reiterate that public housing in Singapore remains affordable to the vast majority of Singaporeans.&nbsp; We have the figures.&nbsp; We have looked at the situation on the ground and we know that this is possible.&nbsp; Our focus on home ownership has served us well and we remain committed to keeping HDB flats within the reach of most Singaporeans.&nbsp; And we will provide a range of options, a range of flats, to cater to buyers with different aspirations.&nbsp; But the Government cannot ensure that flat buyers will get their ideal flat at the specific location and at the time that they prefer, preferably as soon as they get married, they will move into the new flat.&nbsp; That is not possible.&nbsp; Flat buyers need to be realistic in their expectations.&nbsp; But wherever they live, they can be assured that they will enjoy access to amenities and facilities that are characteristic of our HDB towns.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will build up our own towns even more.&nbsp; We will put in place the public housing system that will cater to the needs of Singaporeans, and not just look at them as buyers of flats and forget <p align=left>Column: 1270 </p>about them, but treat them as people whom we will have as customers for a long time, over their life time, in fact.&nbsp; So young couples will be assisted to start their families with a roof over their head.&nbsp; Those who wish to upgrade, we will facilitate when their families grow.&nbsp; Those who wish to monetise their flat when they grow old, we will help.&nbsp; And this is the way that we will strengthen the public housing programme as one of the key social security pillars of Singapore.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will, Sir, elaborate on this a little bit more in my next speech.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Whatever they have built when they were young, that is a family and a house, becomes a tragedy for them when they are old.<p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few times, I have&nbsp;met many elderly people who have sold their flats to live with their children.&nbsp; This is their aspiration to have a happy life with their favourite child.&nbsp; The money they received from the sale is usually distributed to their children, and a large proportion goes into renovating their children&rsquo;s flat where they will stay, or to pay part of that child&rsquo;s flat arrears.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the house that they sold is the only asset that they will ever have and they disburse it to their children as proof of their love.&nbsp; However, love often runs out after their money runs out, until they cannot live with each other.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to move, but the other children have hidden resentment because most of their parents&rsquo; money was used to renovate their sibling&rsquo;s house. So, these<p align=left>Column: 1271 </p> children would not accept them.&nbsp; Or these other homes are already congested with other grandchildren or relatives who are lodging.&nbsp; So they usually complain to the MPs to get rental homes that are usually for the needy, but not for the elderly.&nbsp; I feel sad thinking of their fate.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is good for the elderly to live with their children during old age. But, they should not have sold their house, so that they can depend on this asset when such a situation occurs.&nbsp; Usually, this group of people does not know how to use the money that they received from selling their flat for the long term.&nbsp;<br> I think HDB&rsquo;s Lease Buy-Back Scheme, that was announced last year, is good.&nbsp; I ask the Minister whether he can further explain this scheme and how it can&nbsp;be disseminated to those who need it most.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 1349-1350.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This number is small because only those who have taken one housing subsidy is eligible for the Lease Buy-Back Scheme.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Minister to review this restriction and allow all elderly 2-room and 3-room flat dwellers to benefit from the Lease Buy-Back Scheme, regardless of the number of subsidies that they have enjoyed.&nbsp; If the objective of the scheme is to help needy elderly Singaporeans unlock the value of their flat so that they can have a retirement income, then this should not be limited only to those who have enjoyed only one subsidy.&nbsp; Imagine a situation&nbsp;where there are two financially strapped elderly couples, both living in 3-room flats, but one couple can enjoy a retirement income under the Lease Buy-Back Scheme, but the other cannot do so because of the restriction,&nbsp;and both are equally needy.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point I would like to ask the Minister is to do more to promote the scheme of elderly households as many are still ignorant of its benefits and some also worry that this scheme would deprive them of a home.&nbsp;

An increasing number in 4- and 5-room flats, especially those who struggle to service their HDB loans, want to sell their flats so that they do not have to depend on the Government for handouts or on others for their daily needs and medical care.&nbsp; Many are retired or working on odd jobs and they tell us they cannot rely on their adult children who themselves are facing economic problems.&nbsp; I have seen an increasing number of them at my MPS.&nbsp; Some elderly couples live in 4- and 5-room flats and now no longer need to live in such large flats because their adult children have moved out.&nbsp; They are asset rich but cash poor.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they have come across all sorts of obstacles if they want to downgrade to cash out.&nbsp; For one, they cannot get a second concessionary HDB loan.&nbsp; The irony is that they can only get a second HDB concessionary loan if they upgrade it<p align=left>Column: 1273 </p> to a bigger flat that they do not need and&nbsp;do not want.&nbsp; Instead of making it easier for them to downgrade and live within their means, HDB would rather send them letters of demand with threat to repossess their flat but without giving them any realistic housing options.&nbsp; Older residents tell me that banks will not give them housing loans because of their age.&nbsp; HDB will also not give them a housing loan if they have taken two previously and they cannot rent a flat from the HDB because of the 30-month debarment period.&nbsp; If they make any profit from the sale, even if most of the profit will go into paying off their own debts, the HDB will disqualify them from the rental queue.&nbsp; If they rent a room or&nbsp;flat in the open market, it will mean even more money out of their pocket as rentals are rising, adding to their financial burden and troubled minds, rather than easing it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would urge the Minister to make it easier for those above 62 to monetise their flats by downgrading to a small 3- or 2-room flat by relaxing the rules for the elderly and building more smaller flats and elderly studios for them to downgrade to.&nbsp; At the same time, this would also make available more larger flats for younger families to upgrade to.&nbsp; The Minister has previously explained the general philosophy for subsidies which is to encourage family formation and personal responsibility.&nbsp; But the Government has been reluctant to allow the elderly to live off the profit from the subsidised flat by downgrading, fearing that they might be taking more than two bites of the cherry.&nbsp; There is one bite for those starting a family, another bite for upgraders.&nbsp; But those who need to downgrade get no bite, but instead will get bitten.&nbsp; Why not the HDB consider giving a small bite for those above 62 to downgrade?&nbsp; Give a financial incentive for the elderly to downgrade to a smaller flat, the way HDB&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1274 </p>gives financial incentives for young families to upgrade to a larger flat.&nbsp; Yes, a one-off downgrading subsidy for the elderly.&nbsp; I am not saying for all downgraders, just for the elderly.&nbsp; This is to help&nbsp;provide for their retirement needs, especially as many are living longer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB can spread out their housing subsidies over the cost of the lifetime of different groups:&nbsp;&nbsp;one, when you get married; one, when you upgrade and one, when you want to downgrade,&nbsp;instead of stacking it up at the beginning.&nbsp; The Minister knows that not all are able to find work, especially the lower educated women.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So they do not qualify for rental flats.&nbsp; The banks do not lend them.&nbsp; HDB turns them down.&nbsp; And we could be talking about a family who is willing to go to a smaller place.&nbsp; They know that they could not afford a larger flat.&nbsp; So&nbsp;does not this approach of willing to live within their means align&nbsp;with our&nbsp;policy of self-reliance?&nbsp; And in our society today it is an aspiration to own a larger flat,&nbsp;and the majority who chose to downgrade would not have chosen to do so.&nbsp; So it&nbsp;takes courage to tell your family that&nbsp;you are moving to a smaller house.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this family generally needs help, could we then<p align=left>Column: 1275 </p> consider making the policy for downgrading a bit more easier and flexible?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, the \"Home Ownership Scheme\" policy of the HDB aims to encourage Singaporeans to own their own home, big or small, so that they can have a property they can call their own, and serve as a form of security for the people.&nbsp; However, with the escalating prices of HDB flats, I wonder if every Singaporean can really afford to purchase a flat sold by HDB and whether this \"Home Ownership Scheme\" will still be able to attract the response and support of young Singaporeans.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.30&nbsp;pm</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty years ago, a three-room flat was sold at about $30,000.&nbsp; A fresh university graduate would earn a monthly salary of about $1,000 to $1,200, and with a 15-year repayment period, he would pay about $150 to $160 per month, and that was about 15% of his monthly salary.&nbsp; Today, a three-room flat is sold at about $150,000.&nbsp; A university graduate is now paid about $3,000 a month.&nbsp; With the same 15-year repayment period, he will have to pay more than $800 per month, or 28% of his monthly salary.&nbsp; The burden is very heavy, resulting in&nbsp;&ldquo;money not enough&rdquo;.&nbsp; Although the quality of our HDB flats has gone up, it is very good, but the standard of living seems to have gone down.&nbsp; People may have the means to buy the flat.&nbsp; But do they have the means to maintain and service the very high monthly instalments? This&nbsp; is something that Singaporeans are worried about.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether there is any package to slow down the escalation of the HDB flat prices and, at the same time, help those who are unable to service the loan instalments.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1276 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the HDB flat owners who are in financial difficulties have no choice but to sell their four-room flat and&nbsp;buy a three-room flat instead.&nbsp; But after selling their four-room flat and buying a three-room flat, there is not much money&nbsp;left.&nbsp; So would HDB consider building some smaller flats, like one-room or two-room flats, and the lease may not be so long as 99 years?&nbsp; The flats may perhaps be sold with a lease of 50 years so that the prices could be lower, and hence more affordable to the people.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, two years ago, I also suggested that HDB convert some of the vacant flats in Jurong West into smaller flats for rental&nbsp;to the lower income.&nbsp; I wonder if any of these flats have been converted and rented out to the needy people.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For a number of these residents, they had just recently sold their flats and were not allowed to rent a flat from HDB for a period of 30 months.&nbsp; Nevertheless, many of them pleaded with me to make an appeal on their behalf because they have either sold their flat at a loss or had used the sale proceeds to pay off debts incurred previously or they had to pay their medical bills.&nbsp; The standard reply from HDB is that an ex-lessee who had sold his flat in the open market is unable to apply for a rental flat for 30 months so as to discourage these ex-lessees from competing with the poor and needy who really need a flat.&nbsp; I am sure many Members of this House are familiar with such a reply.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand the rationale for this policy.&nbsp; However, I would urge HDB to<p align=left>Column: 1277 </p> reconsider this policy and to implement a policy to assess every application on a needs basis rather than a blanket debarment.&nbsp; Just to cite an example.&nbsp; Last month, I had a resident who came to see me to ask for a rental flat.&nbsp; He had just sold his flat and would have made a small profit - $5,000, $10,000.&nbsp; Under the existing rules, he is definitely not eligible to rent a flat.&nbsp; However, this resident is old.&nbsp; He has numerous medical ailments.&nbsp; He and his wife are unable to work due to their medical condition.&nbsp; They have no children or relatives who could look after them in the future.&nbsp; The small profit he made from the sale of the flat would be used to pay for their medical bills or for some daily expenses.&nbsp; It would last them maybe one to two years.&nbsp; How would they manage the rest of their lives without any more savings?&nbsp; The couple was understandably worried about their future, as both could not work and their funds could only last them one to two years.&nbsp; After that, would they become destitute or would they have to apply for public assistance?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my point is that not every person who sells his flat at a slight profit could rent a flat in the open market at non-subsidised rates.&nbsp; I have come across several cases where the resident tells me that he had incurred debts and had used the sale proceeds to repay the debt.&nbsp; Hence, he needed to rent a subsidised flat.&nbsp; What do I do?&nbsp; Tell him that, too bad, he had already consumed his subsidies previously and, hence, is no longer entitled to a rental flat?&nbsp; I believe the Government can do more for such people.&nbsp; We should consider how we can stretch out a hand to such residents and help them when they are down and out on their luck.&nbsp; They are asking for a roof over their heads and to live in a more dignified manner.&nbsp; I believe we can help them instead of asking them to stay with relatives whom they do not get along well<p align=left>Column: 1278 </p> with.&nbsp; The Government's focus is really building an inclusive society which leaves no one behind.&nbsp; Let us try to reach out to and help every Singaporean in need because every Singaporean counts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another matter is that I do meet well-dressed people during my walkabouts who do not look poor and needy staying in rental flats.&nbsp; I call on HDB to conduct periodic checks to ensure that their tenants do not illegally rent out these flats and earn some income on the side.&nbsp; Those who do not have a real need for a rental flat from HDB should not deprive other genuine cases of having their rental flat.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They cannot afford to rent an entire flat in the open market.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many landlords will not rent out rooms to them together with their children, so <p align=left>Column: 1280</p>they have to split up - the mother in one rented room in one flat, and the children in another rented room in another flat.&nbsp;

For many recently-divorced women, especially those who had been abused by their husbands, it is a traumatic stage in their lives.&nbsp; Some are housewives or have low-paid jobs and it will take them some time to find a stable job.&nbsp; They find it hard to be strong for themselves, their children and to make ends meet.&nbsp; Some have no other family members to help them.&nbsp; When they appeal to the HDB for a rental flat, they get the usual replies.&nbsp; They have to wait for eight to nine months, or they are permanently debarred from a rental flat because they have sold their matrimonial flat and have, in the process, enjoyed two housing subsidies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

If I may give an example of what happens when they are left to fend for themselves.&nbsp; One divorcee who came to see me was aged 51, earns about $1,500 as an airport trainee.&nbsp; She has two children.&nbsp; After she was told that she had to vacate her matrimonial flat by a certain date, she came to see me to find a place to stay.&nbsp; I wrote to the HDB for a housing loan to buy a three-room flat as no bank would give her one.&nbsp; HDB replied that, at<p align=left>Column: 1281 </p> her age, it will be unwise for her to buy a flat.&nbsp; And since she has enjoyed two housing subsidies, she is not eligible for a rental flat.&nbsp; As a result of that, she had to rent two rooms in two separate flats at $1,000 a month for herself and her two children.&nbsp; That leaves her precious little for her daily needs.&nbsp; Why should we reduce her to a welfare case?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB has to adjust and be relevant to the changing social trends or else we will see a rising number of single-parent households separated with the mother renting a room in one flat and her children in another flat, and living in poverty.&nbsp; I would also like to call for a review of the policy towards rental flats.&nbsp; This Government takes pride in full home ownership.&nbsp; But this appears to be unrealistic and difficult to sustain, given the widening income gap and the changing social trends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, HDB sets aside about 5% of its total housing stock to rental flats.&nbsp; Is this sufficient?&nbsp; Should we review our policy towards full home ownership?&nbsp; From the cases coming to us, it is clear that, for an increasing number, owning a flat is an albatross around their necks, rather than a life buoy.&nbsp; We give generous housing subsidies to help lower-income people to buy a flat but we should recognise that, sometimes, circumstances change, eg, the couple get divorced, they lose their jobs, they have to sell their flat, and then what?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recognise that HDB has done a great job of providing roofs over the heads of most Singaporeans.&nbsp; We do not have the homeless slumming on the streets, as in other cities, such as London, Paris and New York.&nbsp; But this is sometimes not because all is well here but because vagrants are diligently picked up and sent to welfare homes.&nbsp; There is a lot of difference between living in welfare<p align=left>Column: 1282 </p> homes and in a rental flat.&nbsp; You have your self-respect and your space and freedom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would urge the Minister to look more closely into how we can liberalise the rental sector with subsidised flats so that Singaporeans have more access to them, including&nbsp;HDB subsidised rental flats.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank Members for raising the issues of the elderly and the low-income and their housing needs.&nbsp; It gives me the opportunity to explain how we cater to the housing needs of these two groups.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first starting point is that most Singaporeans do have a house that they own as a result of the Home Ownership Programme and the house that they own appreciates in value as Singapore prospers.&nbsp; We had a survey done in 2005.&nbsp; The Department of Statistics did this study.&nbsp; It showed that HDB households, on average, had a net equity of $154,000.&nbsp; By \"net equity\", I mean assets minus the outstanding loans.&nbsp; This net equity of $154,000 was the 2005 figure, and I suspect the figure may be higher today.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When these households retire, their flat will be an asset that is of significant economic value.&nbsp; They have paid for this house over the years with their hard-earned savings.&nbsp; Now, when they retire, it is a roof over their heads as well as a shield against economic uncertainty.&nbsp; Another statistic - most of the elderly HDB households above 65 years old have no outstanding HDB or bank loan.&nbsp; By \"most\", I am talking about 90% of HDB households above 65 years old&nbsp; who have fully paid up for their flats.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main issue now is how do we unlock the value that is within the HDB flat so that it can contribute to their retirement income.&nbsp; I do recognise that different households and different families have different ways to unlock or monetise their flat equity, depending on their<p align=left>Column: 1283 </p> different preferences, needs, etc.&nbsp; In recognition of this, HDB has put in place a whole array of monetisation options.&nbsp; Let me very quickly just run through them.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, very obviously, is subletting.&nbsp; You can monetise by subletting your flat and then moving in with the family.&nbsp; This is an ideal arrangement.&nbsp; It not only gives you a steady stream of income but it also helps you to be closer to the family.&nbsp; HDB has been gradually relaxing the subletting policy so that more households can sublet their flats.&nbsp; So far, close to 18,000 households have taken up the option to sublet the whole flat.&nbsp; One quarter of them are elderly households above 55 years old.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to highlight a case that was published in <I>Zaobao</I> recently.&nbsp; 57-year-old Mr Wong sublet his Ang Mo Kio three-room flat for $1,700 a month.&nbsp; He and his wife and son, then went to stay with their daughter and son-in-law in their executive apartment in Jurong West.&nbsp; When <I>Zaobao</I> interviewed him, he said, yes, he has more cash in hand now but, more importantly, staying under one roof has brought the family closer.&nbsp; I wanted to highlight this case because it is important for such examples to be highlighted and I hope more elderly Singaporeans, like Mr Wong, will benefit from the subletting policy.&nbsp; If you do not want to sublet your whole flat, you can also sublet one or two rooms.&nbsp; If you have a five-room flat, you can very easily get $300, $400 or $500 per room for your flat.&nbsp; That is not a bad option either.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not want to sublet either the whole flat or the rooms and want something more permanent, you can move to a smaller flat or you can buy a short-lease 30-year studio apartment.&nbsp; Our studio apartments have been very popular with the elderly.&nbsp; We have close to 100% take-up rate for 1,700 units that we have to date.&nbsp; Members have asked for more of such units to be built.&nbsp; I am happy to<p align=left>Column: 1284 </p> inform them that, yes, we will do so.&nbsp; In fact, this year, we intend to launch another 400 more studio apartments.&nbsp; We will build them in different estates so that the elderly can choose a studio apartment in a familiar neighbourhood or, better still, where their children are staying.&nbsp; Not only studio apartments, we are also going to build more of the small two-room flats which are suitable for the low-income as well as the elderly.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the options that I have described meet the needs of most elderly home owners.&nbsp; But some elderly low-income home owners - these are the ones in smaller flats - may need a little bit more help to unlock their flat equity to meet retirement needs. Last year, at the National Day Rally, the Prime Minister announced that HDB is going to introduce a new scheme, what is known as a Lease Buy-Back Scheme, or LBS for short, to help such households.&nbsp; Let me now give an update of the Lease Buy-Back Scheme as requested by Members.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Lease Buy-Back Scheme will be launched in 2009. We need the time to work out some of the technical details.&nbsp; I will explain a few of these later on.&nbsp; The Lease Buy-Back scheme will supplement CPF LIFE, which is a lifelong annuity scheme that was announced by the Ministry of Manpower recently.&nbsp; It will supplement CPF LIFE to help the elderly with their retirement adequacy.&nbsp; Under the LBS, HDB will purchase the tail-end of the flat lease from the elderly household. And in addition to the housing equity that is unlocked by this purchase at the tail-end of the lease, HDB will provide a $10,000 subsidy. So the money from the buy-back of the lease plus the $10,000 will form the capital for the Lease Buy-Back Scheme.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the housing equity unlocked and the $10,000 subsidy, $5,000 will be<p align=left>Column: 1285 </p> given to the household as an upfront lump sum payment.&nbsp; The remainder will then be used to purchase a CPF LIFE plan to provide the owner with a monthly stream of income for life.&nbsp; The family will continue to stay in their flat which will be left with the 30-year lease.&nbsp; Let me give specific examples to illustrate this. For example, a couple jointly owns a three-room flat and the three-room flat is worth, say, $200,000, with a 70-year lease remaining.&nbsp; They are both 62 years old.&nbsp; If they sign on to the Lease Buy-Back Scheme, they will get a 30-year flat lease because HDB will buy back the 40 years, giving them 30 years left.&nbsp; They will get a $5,000 upfront lump sum and they will get a combined payout for life at about $490 per month.&nbsp; So, they will be able to stay in their flat for the next 30 years. They will have $5,000 cash upfront and $490 for life from age 62. This monthly payout, together with their CPF savings or their monthly lifelong income from CPF LIFE will then help them to enjoy a more financially secure retirement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not forget that this is only one part of their financial retirement income.&nbsp; If they have CPF savings and CPF retirement amount, they will then get the income from the CPF LIFE. And on top of that, they will get this amount arising from the LBS.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So who can qualify for the LBS? It is a subsidised scheme. The $10,000 upfront is an additional subsidy over and above the purchase price of the lease. So there will be some eligibility criteria.&nbsp; First, beneficiaries must not have enjoyed more than one housing subsidy.&nbsp; Second, it will be restricted to two and three-room HDB lessees. Why? Because owners of larger flats are able to take advantage of other monetisation options, such as downgrading. So these are the two main eligibility criteria for the LBS.&nbsp; How many households will qualify?&nbsp; Our estimate is about 25,000 households will qualify for the LBS and this is something like 70% of<p align=left>Column: 1286 </p> elderly households in two-room and three-room flats.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah has asked that some of these eligibility criteria be relaxed. For example, why restrict it only for those who have not enjoyed more than one housing subsidy? The answer is very simple. Because, with a second subsidy inherent in the LBS, we need to make sure that it is only applicable to those who have not enjoyed the second subsidy as the LBS is tantamount to a second housing subsidy.&nbsp; Why not for the four-roomers?&nbsp; This is something that we will look into. We can examine, and perhaps after implementing the scheme for a while, depending on the reaction to the scheme, it is possible for us to consider, perhaps extending it to the four-roomers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that the LBS, together with CPF LIFE, will substantially improve the financial situation of lower income elderly households.&nbsp; In particular, many of today's elderly do not have much in their retirement accounts. And I agree that we should make a concerted effort to try and promote this scheme to make the eligible households aware of the benefits of the scheme, allay some of their fears, actively promote the scheme.&nbsp; One of their concerns may well be:&nbsp; what happens after 30 years?&nbsp; What happens if they outlive the 30 years?&nbsp; Here, I would like to assure them that they will continue to have a roof over their heads even if they outlive the LBS lease. We will look into housing options for them if they are fortunate enough to outlive the 30-year lease. This is a similar situation to, say, for example, the studio apartment lessees, some of whom may outlive their 30-year lease. We will look into the circumstance of each case to determine the appropriate housing arrangement for them.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said about the LBS may sound rather complicated so I have asked my staff to see how we can make it simpler, how we can promote the<p align=left>Column: 1287 </p> scheme, because some of the scheme details can be quite technical. They have come up with this slogan, LBS, L for live, ie, live in your flat; B for bonus, ie, bonus of $10,000; and S for steady income for life. I hope that works.&nbsp; If not, I will ask Minister Lim Swee Say for another option.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is for the elderly.&nbsp; Let me now turn to the lower income.&nbsp; Many have spoken about housing for the low income.&nbsp; There were many suggestions on how we can provide more help to this group - subsidies, concessionary loans for downgrading, subsidies to rent from the open market, and so on.&nbsp; As I explained at length in my first speech on housing, the Government provides very heavy subsidies to keep our flats affordable, as much as $88,000 throughout the lifetime.&nbsp; I hope Members appreciate that no matter how generous the Government is or would like to be, there is a limit, a finite limit, on the amount of money that is set aside for housing subsidies and, therefore, a limit to the amount of housing subsidies that each household can receive.&nbsp; That is why, for instance, we generally limit households to one concessionary loan. We do provide a second concessionary rate loan to support upgrading because, as families grow, we see them wanting to upgrade themselves. That is a good thing. That is something that we want to promote.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB generally does not offer a second concessionary loan to downgraders as most of the downgraders - and I say most, not all - will have benefited from housing subsidies.&nbsp; They would have substantial proceeds from selling their larger flat. So it really does not make sense to provide all of them with a further subsidy in the form of another concessionary loan.&nbsp; But I think Members are also aware that those households who need to downgrade because of genuine financial difficulty, do get special treatment from HDB.&nbsp; HDB has exercised flexibility.&nbsp; And I want to assure Dr Teo <p align=left>Column: 1288 </p>and other Members that HDB will continue to exercise flexibility.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On their part, households must help themselves by exercising financial prudence and taking a longer term view.&nbsp; They must be ultimately responsible for their own actions.&nbsp; I do not think it is wise for all Members here to just look at the picture from the MPS cases that they receive.&nbsp; Many of them are deserving, but not all of them are.&nbsp; This is where we have to make a difficult distinction between those who are in genuine need and those who are not.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Home buyers will have to exercise prudence by choosing the flat that they can afford. We have imposed credit assessment to make sure that they do not buy beyond their means. Those who are already in financial difficulty with their existing loan, before they accumulate even more arrears, they should think of their options seriously.&nbsp; If they can spare a room, rent out a room.&nbsp; If not, downgrade to a more affordable flat. As I said, we have given second, third - I have even seen cases of a fourth - non-subsidised HDB loans to those who are in serious financial difficulty.&nbsp; HDB's Financial Assistance Measures are only given to the family to tide them over temporary financial difficulties.&nbsp; They are not meant as a long-term solution.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Budget debate, Mr Ong Kian Min mentioned the case of one of his constituents and he was talking about compulsory acquisition.&nbsp; He said that compulsory acquisition is not the long-term answer.&nbsp; I want to assure Mr Ong and other Members that for HDB, compulsory acquisition is absolutely the last resort. It is a serious decision not taken lightly, carried out only after many other measures have been taken, ie, many options have been exhausted and only if the lessees themselves do not make any effort to resolve their financial situation.&nbsp; In fact, the purpose of this action is to <p align=left>Column: 1289 </p>prevent the family getting into more serious financial difficulty.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the case of Mdm Judy Mitchell that Mr Ong mentioned. Let me give this House the full picture.&nbsp; She lives in a five-room flat with an adult daughter and mother. This is her third flat.&nbsp; She bought and sold two previous flats. She made profits of about $190,000. She has enjoyed three concessionary loans. She started having difficulties paying her housing loan for her current flat soon after she bought it.&nbsp; Four occasions, six months each occasion, over two years, she was allowed to defer her mortgage payments, or pay only 50%. She did not make any attempt to find a long-term solution and the arrears kept mounting. She was not receptive to HDB's suggestions to downgrade or include her working daughter to service the loan. As a result, the loan outstanding today is higher than the original loan she took. They have to downgrade while they still have enough sale proceeds to afford a small flat.&nbsp; I would like to urge Mr Ong to persuade the family - please do the right thing quickly. If they cannot get a bank loan, I will ask HDB to consider providing a non-concessionary HDB loan for them.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This case illustrates many of the challenges that HDB faces in helping HDB lessees in mortgage arrears.&nbsp; Unfortunately, not all lessees in need are receptive to helpful suggestions.&nbsp; Worse, they are reluctant to make any effort to help themselves. They expect HDB and the Government to help them indefinitely.&nbsp; I think it is most unwise of HDB to do so.&nbsp; It will be most unfair to the many residents who live within their means, who work hard to pay off their loans, albeit with a bit of help and forbearance from HDB from time to time.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now talk about the public rental system.&nbsp; I think many Members here<p align=left>Column: 1290 </p> have expressed their concerns about the public rental scheme.&nbsp; I agree, even while we have the home ownership scheme, there will always be a group for whom home ownership is not a viable option.&nbsp; This is what Ms Irene Ng said and it is perfectly true.&nbsp; We do have to provide for the low income who cannot afford a flat even with the most generous of housing subsidies.&nbsp; So the public rental scheme is really the final safety net to help families who are truly in need, who have no other options to turn to.&nbsp; Each rental flat is very heavily subsidised.&nbsp; A one-room rental flat receives an equivalent of $6,000 per year in rental subsidy.&nbsp; If a family stays in the flat for 20 years, they would have consumed $125,000 in rental subsidy, or even more than if we had given them a home ownership flat.&nbsp; That is the reason why we have such stringent criteria in place, to make sure that the rental subsidies are only for the very needy.&nbsp; They are not for existing flat owners who decide that they want to cash out, and then now they want to have a rental flat.&nbsp; Yes, we encourage the elderly to monetise, but they can choose from many other monetisation options - that I have explained earlier.&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked why the 30-month debarment.&nbsp; The reason is that we do not want to have people who already own flats joining the queue for rental flats.<br></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.00 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the supply and demand of rental flats?&nbsp; There is a cause for concern.&nbsp; There is a shortage of rental flats.&nbsp; I have asked HDB to resolve this issue in three ways.&nbsp; First, we will increase the supply of rental flats; second, we will review the eligibility criteria for rental flats; and, third, we will step up enforcement to weed out those who abuse the privilege of rental flats.&nbsp; Today, we have about 42,000 rental flats.&nbsp; We will build more rental flats over the next few years.&nbsp; We will increase our stock by 20% in the first instance, to 50,000.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1291 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006, I announced that we will resume the rental flat building programme and, since then, we have built some 2,200 new units.&nbsp; We have converted some old flats into rental flats.&nbsp; So 900 over flats will be ready by this quarter.&nbsp; These are the rental units that are converted from vacant blocks, that was suggested by Mr Ang Mong Seng.&nbsp; We are going to build another 2,000 rental flats this year (2008), and these will be located all over Singapore.&nbsp; They will be ready for allocation from 2011 onwards.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But building more flats on its own will not be an adequate or sustainable solution.&nbsp; We have to target our rental flats so that they are reserved for the genuinely needy.&nbsp; We will embark on a comprehensive review of the rental scheme, and we will put in place more holistic assessment criteria of rental flat applicants.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who are the people in the rental queue at the moment?&nbsp; Ex-HDB lessees, those who either have a flat now or who had a flat in the past, make up two-thirds of the total rental applicants.&nbsp; The majority of the applicants have enjoyed housing subsidies in the past.&nbsp; Did these applicants fall on hard times?&nbsp; Yes, some of them.&nbsp; But those who already had their HDB flats in the past, more than half of them were not affected by mortgage arrears.&nbsp; They had no mortgage problems.&nbsp; They were not affected by divorces.&nbsp; 20% of them had enough money to buy themselves another smaller flat.&nbsp; Many of them have relatives, siblings, families, whom they could stay with.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I hope Members will agree with me that those who can afford home ownership and those who have family support should not join the rental queue.&nbsp; Otherwise, they are going to crowd out the more needy cases.&nbsp; Mr Masagos, for example, spoke about the elderly who sell their flats, give the proceeds to their children, the children turf them out, and <p align=left>Column: 1292 </p>then they come to HDB for a rental flat, when their relationship sours.&nbsp; I appreciate his understanding that HDB rental flats cannot be used to encourage such irresponsible behaviour of their children.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the question is: are there other ways to help these families, rather than provide a heavily subsidised rental flat?&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng suggested short-term housing for low-income divorcee families.&nbsp; We can look into this idea.&nbsp; But I submit that the issue of dysfunctional families, divorces and so on, is not just a housing issue.&nbsp; What was the cause of the problem, in the first place?&nbsp; More than 20% of those applying for rental flats are divorcee families, and the numbers are increasing.&nbsp; We will have to look at the overall issue of low-income dysfunctional families from a wider perspective, together with MCYS and other Ministries, and not just from the housing perspective.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So this review of rental housing criteria will also examine how we can encourage existing tenants to move into home ownership when their financial situation improves.&nbsp; There are many instances of families who have successfully improved themselves and they have moved up, and they are moving into home ownership flats.&nbsp; And I would like to hear more of these success stories.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third thing that we will do to try to correct this imbalance is to carry out enforcement, to weed out those who do not need or who have abused the privilege of rental flats.&nbsp; One Member recently told me that one of her rental flat tenants had just installed a split unit airconditioner in her flat, courtesy of her children.&nbsp; Another has just asked for a season car parking ticket.&nbsp; Other Members, like Mr Lim Biow Chuan just now, have told me about rental flats being sublet.&nbsp; HDB will not hesitate to terminate the flat tenancy of those who abuse or violate the conditions of the lease, and redistribute these flats to the deserving cases in the queue.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1293 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in summary, let me say that our home ownership programme will enable the elderly to monetise their flats to meet retirement needs.&nbsp; Those who are less well off and where monetisation options are not so readily available, we will offer the new Lease Buy-Back Scheme to them, to help them unlock that flat equity.&nbsp; For low-income families, we will build more rental flats, even while we review the scheme to ensure that the rental flat subsidies are reserved for the genuinely needy.&nbsp; We will continue to be flexible to help families in financial hardship, but the individual has to exercise prudence, financial responsibility and do something to help himself even as he seeks help from HDB.&nbsp; And in this way, we can continue to provide housing subsidies to Singaporeans who really need help.<br></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Its objectives are to renew older HDB estates and to share the wealth of the nation with Singaporeans under the asset enhancement scheme.&nbsp; The programme became&nbsp;a political tool for the PAP in 1997 general election under a blatant abuse of power by the PAP Government to alter voting behaviour.&nbsp; Politics aside, the upgrading programme is funded by the national budget, and the money belongs to all Singaporeans.&nbsp;Denying Singaporeans living in opposition wards, this publicly&nbsp;funded programme&nbsp;is highly discriminatory in nature.&nbsp; Does the Government need&nbsp;to be reminded that residents of opposition wards perform national service duties, and pay the same rate of income tax and GST as any other Singaporeans?&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I took up the issue in Parliament, the Minister's answer was that the criteria for HDB upgrading are based on the age of the flats, geographical spread and support for the programme.&nbsp; When I asked about Hougang's turn for upgrading, the Minister's reply was that Hougang was not due for upgrading for many, many years.&nbsp; Twelve years have passed since the Minister made that statement in 1996.&nbsp; Now I am asking again.&nbsp; Is the wait long enough now for the MUP to come to Hougang?&nbsp; Or is Hougang constituency denied MUP?&nbsp; Are the so-called criteria for the HDB upgrading programme a convenient excuse for the PAP Government to abuse its position in power to discriminate against Singaporeans along the line of political affiliation?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that in 1991, the projected average upgrading cost per flat was $30,000-$38,000.&nbsp; I would like to know how much the Government had spent, on average, for each HDB flat type under MUP by individual precinct completed so far?&nbsp; Taking an average cost of $30,000 for a basic upgrading package and factoring in the co-payment formula,<p align=left>Column: 1295 </p> this Government owes every eligible flat owner in Hougang constituency $22,000 to $27,000 for the long overdue upgrading.&nbsp; In 1995, the Minister for National Development said that the upgrading programme is a long-term programme.&nbsp; It will take 15-20 years to upgrade all the old estates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Since the MUP was started in 1990, I take it that by 2010, all MUPs would have been completed.&nbsp; However, I am surprised to learn from the MND budget that MUP and IUP will be replaced by the Home Improvement Programme (HIP)&nbsp;and the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP).&nbsp; The MUP aims for precinct level upgrade and enhancement whereas the HIP&nbsp;deals more with building defect rectification works.&nbsp; The NRP, on the other hand, is more like the IUP or improvement works undertaken by the Town Councils.&nbsp; So where is the MUP equivalent in scale and level of estate upgrading, as promised to Singaporeans under the asset enhancement scheme?&nbsp; Since the HIP's criteria are similar to MUP, with the level of political support as a factor, would that put the opposition wards last in the queue again?&nbsp; In other words, will opposition wards need to start all over again and wait many, many years for HIP to happen?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, I visited a resident who was injured by falling concrete slabs due to spalling in the kitchen of his flat.&nbsp; As the flat continues to age, spalling concrete can become an issue of safety.&nbsp; Unless the Minister thinks that the safety of residents living in HDB flats in Hougang is of lesser concern than those in the PAP wards, it is only right for the Minister to shorten the waiting time required for HIP to be implemented in the opposition wards.&nbsp; To expedite the HIP, the Minister may want to consider delegating HIP to Town Councils to speed up the implementation of the programme.&nbsp; Alternatively, he can also consider allocating the funds to HDB branch offices to better target essential <p align=left>Column: 1296 </p>repairs to deserving flats under their charge.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would first like to put the upgrading programmes in perspective.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrading programmes complement our home ownership programme by sustaining the value of flats many years after they have been built.&nbsp; They breathe new life into HDB estates by improving the living environment of residents so that they are comparable to newer estates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To meet these objectives, we have different upgrading programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In preparation for an ageing society, lift upgrading has been identified as a major priority.&nbsp; The Government has committed to providing lifts that stop on every floor for all eligible blocks by 2014.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can understand Members' requests to speed up the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP).&nbsp; However, the pace of lift upgrading depends on the available budget and the capacity of the construction industry.&nbsp; It is a massive programme.&nbsp; The cost of bringing lift upgrading to all the remaining eligible blocks is about $3 billion.&nbsp; The construction industry is experiencing a significant upswing now and we should not exacerbate the situation.&nbsp; Indeed, in our review of public projects to be deferred, we have decided not to postpone the LUP, as we have made a commitment to complete by 2014.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to clarify that the Government has already accelerated the LUP from the previous target of 2019 to 2014. There remains about 1,500 blocks to be selected under the LUP. This is a <p align=left>Column: 1297 </p>large number and we have to prioritise, but we are on track.&nbsp; HDB will continue to explore new methods and technologies to keep LUP both affordable and available to more blocks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In reply to Mr Low Thia Khiang's question, he is correct that we have introduced two new upgrading programmes, the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) and Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP).&nbsp; They will replace the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP) and Interim Upgrading&nbsp;Programme (IUP Plus). The MUP and IUP Plus have served us well.&nbsp; To-date, over 130,000 flats have been selected for MUP and over 220,000 flats selected for the IUP Plus.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HIP and NRP were introduced in response to feedback to the Forum on HDB Heartware that several MPs and myself led last year. We held many public dialogues to solicit ideas on ways to build more cohesive communities in HDB towns. Residents said they would like more flexibility and consultation in upgrading. They also wanted upgrading to remain affordable.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, therefore,&nbsp;HIP is designed to focus on improvements for the flat.

HDB should also speed up the HIP programme in order to investigate leakage problems in old blocks, such as in Nee Soon South. The leakages have to be identified and repaired quickly because the absorption problem can spread quickly, and repair costs will increase and cause inconvenience to the occupant.</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Among others, you hear complaints from residents about their upstairs neighbours causing noise nuisance during the sleeping hours or misgivings about their upper floor neighbours hanging wet dripping clothes in the afternoon or, in the case of the next door neighbours, obstructing the corridors with their shoe racks,&nbsp;bicycles or plants.&nbsp; Some even complained about their neighbours having noisy weekends playing mahjong or the smell of&nbsp;chilli \"<I>balachan</I> \" coming into their house and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others complained about irresponsible pet owners or their neighbours being insensitive to them by hanging brooms near their doors.&nbsp; The list goes on.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1299 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As their MP, I must admit sometimes I find myself quite helpless as to how I could help solve their problems or disputes.&nbsp; My grassroots leaders, the town council officers or&nbsp;the HDB officers can spend&nbsp;a disproportionate amount of time on the cases&nbsp;and still sometimes some remain unresolved.&nbsp; Each party will always have their side of the story to tell and, in some cases, it can come in&nbsp;a few pages&nbsp;of email.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of these disputes have dragged on for many years and once in a while you will have some \"incidents\" or outbursts&nbsp;where, in some cases, the Police are called in.&nbsp; Often, by the time the matter is referred to the Community Mediation Centre (CMC), the relationship between the neighbours would already have become&nbsp;irreparable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of factors lead to some of these un-neighbourliness situation at our HDB communities.&nbsp; It is often the case of a few individuals being inconsiderate or showing total disregard for their neighbours.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another&nbsp;is the&nbsp;lack&nbsp;of communication between the neighbours.&nbsp; Many of our residents are not talking to their neighbours even though&nbsp;they may be just staying metres apart.&nbsp; A recent survey by <I>Straits Times</I> published last month also&nbsp;suggested that Singaporeans just do not know their neighbours well, if at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of these neighbourliness disputes could have been prevented if residents already know their neighbours and some goodwill or friendship has been built up.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would like to ask the Minister whether the Ministry is satisfied with the state of neighbourliness in our HDB communities and whether there are plans to strengthen community ownership at the heartlands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the RCs play an important role in promoting neighbourliness within the estate through the&nbsp;activities they organised.&nbsp; Being a more visible resident-centric grassroots organisation, often <p align=left>Column: 1300 </p>interfacing with the residents, RCs can also play a mediating and reconciling role.&nbsp; However, as RC members are essentially volunteers and not everyone has the temperament to manage neighbourhood dispute, they would need some dedicated resource and support from HDB and the other agencies.&nbsp; Hence, I would hope that HDB or its regional&nbsp;office can work with the grassroots organisations to play a more active role to promote neighbourliness. &nbsp;And in situations of neighbours' complaints or disputes, HDB should have trained officers at the Branch Office dedicated to support the RCs in this regard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having received numerous complaints from residents over the years and knowing&nbsp;many of the errant behaviours, perhaps HDB could compile a handy guidebook to tell residents how to be good neighbours and publicise them.&nbsp; It would help promote acceptable norms of good neighbourliness behaviour.&nbsp; RCs can also use this guide as a persuasive tool to help resolve some of the neighbourliness differences.&nbsp; In some&nbsp;cases, HDB needs to be given more resources to investigate serious cases as well as the teeth to take errant neighours to task.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe&nbsp;we can do more to promote neighbourliness in heartlands.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Duties of Landlords in HDB Estates and Heartland Commercial Spaces</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, during my house visits, I have discovered that many of the rented flats are not just in a mess on the inside but the mess is also spilling out into the corridors.&nbsp;

I want to assure the House that HDB takes the building quality of its flats seriously.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2007, less than 3% of&nbsp;our flats were reported to have ceiling leaks, water seepage or spalling concrete.&nbsp; Most of these defects involved the older flats.&nbsp; To help affected lessees, HDB will arrange to&nbsp;repair without charge, defects that are due to poor design or workmanship,&nbsp;although it is the lessee's responsibility for rectification works due to normal wear and tear, especially in the older flats that are 20 years old.&nbsp; The lessees will have to do their part in rectifying defects.&nbsp; However, HDB has&nbsp;a goodwill repair assistance programme to co-pay for rectification works on ceiling leakage and consequential spalling concrete.&nbsp; In addition, HDB is continually working to deliver better quality flats to its residents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2005, HDB has offered an extended warranty scheme for new flats called \"ASSURE 3\".&nbsp; It provides a five-year warranty against ceiling leakage and water seepage and a 10-year warranty against spalling concrete.&nbsp; As for HIP, it will be rolled out progressively due to the large number of eligible flats.&nbsp; Residents will be informed when their block is selected for upgrading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From hardware, let me move on to the software issue to address Mr Liang's concern.&nbsp; The HDB environment is a highrise and high density one.&nbsp; Residents themselves have a key role to play to make their stay a pleasant and harmonious place to live in by being considerate and sensitive to the needs of their neighbours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have Residents Committees, like Mr Liang&nbsp;said, and other grassroots organisations to promote neighbourliness.&nbsp; On its part, HDB organises parties for<p align=left>Column: 1303 </p> residents of new Build-To-Order (BTO) projects for them to get to know one another.&nbsp; HDB also disseminates&nbsp;\"Be a Good Neighbour\" leaflets to new lessees and foreign sub-tenants to promote good neighbourly conduct.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the high density living in HDB estates, it is inevitable that disputes between neighbours arise from time to time.&nbsp; When neighbours need help to resolve their disputes, they can turn to grassroots organisations that Mr Liang has mentioned earlier or for the&nbsp;more serious cases, they can approach the Community Mediation Centre for assistance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preserving neighbourliness is an important matter,&nbsp;whether we know and trust our neighbours, whether we live harmoniously with one another.&nbsp; We have heard stories of how residents who go out of their way to care for their neighbours.&nbsp; But I agree that the situation is less than perfect and more can be done.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to suggest the formation of a working group of MPs, including Mr Liang of course, to look into what more can be done to promote harmonious living and considerate&nbsp;neighbourly behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of duties of landlords in HDB estates and heartland commercial spaces&nbsp;that Mdm Ho has brought up, she is concerned that landlords are not taking enough responsibility for the upkeep of HDB flats and shops after letting out the premises.&nbsp; Lessees of HDB sold flats are responsible for keeping their flats in good condition and ensuring that no&nbsp;disamenity is caused to surrounding residents.&nbsp; This applies even if the lessees sublet their flats.&nbsp; They will be held responsible if their sub-tenants caused nuisance to the neighbours.&nbsp; If sub-tenants continued to cause disamenities&nbsp;despite warnings, HDB can revoke the subletting approval.&nbsp; Mdm Ho may like to know that in the last two years, HDB has issued about 30 written warning&nbsp;letters as well as revoking nine subletting approvals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1304 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For sold shops, owners must take&nbsp;the interest in maintaining and upgrading their shops and common areas as these affect the shopping ambience and the value of their properties directly. Of course, it will affect the rentals that they can charge for their shops.&nbsp; For this reason, many merchant associations work with their town councils to upgrade the common property&nbsp;in their neighbourhood centres and town centres.&nbsp; In addition, town councils are empowered to carry out improvement works to the common property and to impose charges on shopowners for such improvement works.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB has introduced the Revitalisation of Shops Scheme that provides co-funding to help HDB retailers in revitalisation efforts, like the upgrading of common areas and carrying out promotional activities.&nbsp; However, there is a limit to how much the Government can and should do to upkeep and upgrade sold properties.&nbsp; Ultimately, owners must take the responsibility for their properties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho also asked about actions taken against irresponsible acts that endanger lives in HDB estates.&nbsp; HDB takes a very serious view of such violations.&nbsp; Together with the other agencies, we have stepped up enforcement actions against fire hazards in outdoor display areas of shops.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since October 2007, joint inspections covering over 1,100 commercial units across 16 town councils have been conducted and HDB and the town councils also regularly enforce against other irresponsible acts such as killer litter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In his recent speech, Parliamentary Secretary, Dr Maliki, mentioned the value for 2007 is actually $24.5 billion.&nbsp; He also said that the value would be even higher in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have allowed the pace of construction sector to pick up too quickly after the downturn in 2003 and 2004.&nbsp; Too many projects, all coming in a short span of time, had resulted in the construction frenzy and a severe bottleneck which is unhealthy to the industry and&nbsp;economy.&nbsp; And these heightened pace and activities are expected to carry on in the next few years, given the huge pipeline of projects in the next few years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the major ones are the $20 billion worth of the new MRT lines; $2.5 <p align=left>Column: 1306 </p>billion worth of Marina Coastal Expressway; $2 billion healthcare infrastructure costs;&nbsp;$1.2 billion Sports Hub and various other projects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was told it is now the case of the contract work chasing after the contractors.&nbsp; For example, I heard that there is now a severe shortage of piling contractors.&nbsp; There are piling projects where not a single piling contractor submits the tender.&nbsp; We also heard about the long waiting time for cranes.&nbsp; It is not surprising that most of the capacities are being committed to the two IRs and the other mega projects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is good and necessary that we are improving our overall infrastructure and attracting heavyweight investments, I am not sure that it is a good thing to permit so many construction projects at one go and to ramp up in such a short space of time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are implications when we underestimate the construction capacity.&nbsp; Firstly, it leads to rising costs.&nbsp; We have heard that the Sports Hub has now cost us about 50% more to develop.&nbsp; Inevitably, the runaway construction costs would have an impact on the cost of upgrading to HDB and estate improvement programmes.&nbsp; Some of the essential facilities, such as the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and&nbsp;community facilities, would also cost more to build.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, quality.&nbsp; Now, more than ever, we have to redouble our efforts to ensure the quality of the projects.&nbsp; Contractors are now facing even tighter deadlines and having to manage even tighter costs and resource constraints.&nbsp; We have to ensure that they will not compromise on the quality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, the tight labour markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;The industry is facing severe manpower shortage&nbsp;-&nbsp;the architects, project managers, contractors, sub-contractors,<p align=left>Column: 1307 </p> workers.&nbsp; I spoke to some architects and they told me about the nightmare of having to find hundreds of architects overnight, knowing&nbsp;too well that there may not be more projects to sustain them&nbsp;thereafter.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;concerned with the sharp boom and bust in the construction cycle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the local players I spoke to from the industry are not happy with the heating up of the sector.&nbsp; Construction costs have gone up by 20% to 40%, several big projects had already been hit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I welcome the Government's announcement to delay $3 billion worth of projects to spread out the construction demand.&nbsp; Can the Minister enlighten us on the basis of how these projects are being selected for rescheduling and how are the priorities determined?&nbsp; What more can be done to reduce the construction costs?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I think it is important that we identify the blind spots which had prevented us from forecasting the construction activity and assessing the construction capacity more accurately.&nbsp; This would help us avoid future overheating in the construction sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Last year, Mr Liang has rightly put that total contracts awarded hit an all-time high of $24.5 billion.&nbsp; We expect construction demand to remain robust at between $23 billion and $27 billion in 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike the previous peak in 1997, the current boom coincided with strong global and regional construction demand.&nbsp; We therefore have to contend with international competition for construction resources.&nbsp; Some of the&nbsp;observations that Mr Liang has made, for example, in&nbsp;contracting resources, supply of&nbsp;cranes are really due to&nbsp;a global shortage of resources.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current high domestic demand will continue to put pressure on our construction capacity.&nbsp; The Government has anticipated the recovery of the sector and begun easing some manpower policies since early last year.&nbsp; But as we have heard from the Minister for Finance, the ability to forecast is really more of&nbsp;an art, and we will also try to&nbsp;forecast as much as we can, given the information that we have. Given the pace of growth,<p align=left>Column: 1310 </p> the Government has undertaken several measures to mitigate the situation.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have increased the labour capacity.&nbsp; Working with Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Building&nbsp;and Construction Authority (BCA) has taken steps to facilitate the inflow of foreign construction workers and supervisors.&nbsp; These include expanding the capacity of its Overseas Testing Centres and reviewing the list of acceptable qualifications for site supervisors. We have also worked with MOM to further review manpower policies like exempting experienced foreign workers from man-year entitlement requirements, as well as raising the dependency ratio and S-pass quota.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, BCA is also working with the industry to expand the contracting resources. &nbsp;This includes proactively sourcing and securing competent foreign contractors, together with their management teams and specialist contractors, to undertake projects here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Government is moderating its demand for construction resources by deferring about $3 billion worth of projects to after 2009.&nbsp; This will reduce demand for construction manpower by about 17,000 workers and 2,000 professional and technical staff over the next two years.&nbsp; Urgent projects that are essential for meeting Singapore's economic and societal needs, such as key infrastructure development like transportation, and public housing/upgrading projects, will not be affected.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang has also&nbsp;expressed some concern over the quality of work, given the tight capacity situation.&nbsp; I would like to stress that ensuring the quality of our built environment remains a key priority for BCA.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our professional engineers are subjected to stringent registration criteria <p align=left>Column: 1311 </p>and continuing professional development requirements.&nbsp; To enhance building safety, the Building Control (Amendment) Bill was passed last year to strengthen our regulatory framework.&nbsp; Major enhancements include regulating of underground building works, licensing of builders and provision of adequate site supervision teams.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we tackle the current concerns of resource crunch, we must also remain focused on our long-term vision to make Singapore's built environment a safe, high-quality, sustainable and accessible one.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo has asked about plans to develop a sustainable built environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, BCA rolled out its Green Mark Scheme for buildings. In recent months, through active promotion and industry education, we have seen an exponential rise in the number of buildings applying for Green Mark certification.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, over 200 projects are awaiting assessment.&nbsp; By the end of FY07, there will be close to 100 buildings that will be Green Mark certified.&nbsp; Of these, 10 buildings obtained the highest Green Mark Platinum level, achieving at least 30% energy efficiency.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now a growing awareness of the business case for Green Mark buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;To demonstrate our resolve to embrace sustainable development, Singapore will become one of the first few cities in the world to require new buildings and those undergoing major retrofitting to meet minimum green building standards come April 2008.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To spur industry players to vie for higher than the basic Green Mark standard, BCA has put in place a $20 million Green Mark Incentive Scheme since December 2006.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1312 </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the biggest challenge facing many cities, including Singapore, is getting existing buildings up to Green Building standards. &nbsp;To expedite, BCA is working with the National Environment Agency (NEA) to promote energy efficiency in existing buildings.&nbsp; The Energy Efficiency Improvement Assistance Scheme (EASe) from NEA co-funds the cost of carrying out energy audit for existing buildings.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BCA is also developing a new grant to encourage existing buildings to upgrade their building envelopes. The grant, set at about $9 million for a start, will help offset the cost of upgrading fa&ccedil;ade features to improve the overall energy efficiency of the building.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BCA will continue to spearhead concerted efforts to adopt sustainable construction in Singapore.&nbsp; It has issued guidelines on the use of steel and high-strength concrete, and will be implementing engineering guidelines for use of steel manufactured to standards other than the existing British standards.&nbsp; Together with the Waste Management and Recycling Association of Singapore and other agencies, BCA&nbsp;is developing a framework for accrediting construction waste recycling processing facilities within the next few months.&nbsp; This will ensure that recycled aggregates will have a consistent quality to be used as alternative construction materials effectively.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give sustainable construction a further boost, BCA is exploring the introduction of a $15 million Sustainable Construction Fund to incentivise developers to use sustainable materials in their projects.&nbsp; More details will be released later.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of upgrading private estates, I would like to thank Ms Lee and Mr Ang for their interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an on-<p align=left>Column: 1313 </p>going upgrading programme for our private estates, called the Estate Upgrading Programme (EUP).&nbsp; Introduced in 2000, it is intended for upgrading of the public infrastructure of private housing estates.&nbsp; So far, 30 of our older private estates have been selected for EUP, benefiting some 23,000 dwelling units.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The upgrading or development of new parks and playgrounds in private estates can be undertaken when an estate undergoes EUP.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, NParks also looks into the upgrading of neighbourhood parks under its park redevelopment programme.&nbsp; The main criterion for NParks&rsquo; upgrading of parks is the condition of the park. &nbsp;Within the allocated resources, priority will be given to those parks where the facilities have undergone more serious wear and tear, and where conditions are poorer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1314</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When upgrading park facilities in private estates, NParks would seek feedback from the Neighbourhood Committees to ensure that the facilities meet the needs of the residents.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I am quite sure that not only are there worries among the public about rising food prices, these reports further alarmed our population.&nbsp; Clearly, I have not heard that the Government is for direct food subsidies that our neighbours have resorted to.&nbsp;

The principal, therefore,&nbsp;called all parents to assure them.&nbsp; That reminded me of the incident last year when China was criticised for its food safety and quality.&nbsp; Then, Singapore took action as well, most notably, the ban on three types of tooth paste from China.&nbsp; Tooth paste is not exactly food, but then we still put it into our mouth.&nbsp; The Chinese Minister responsible for food safety also had to assure&nbsp;the public and the international community about the quality and safety of food imported from China.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say that monitoring and administering food safety is not just the responsibility of the Government but that of the grassroots and community at large as well.&nbsp; There must be compliance with basic hygiene and safety measures.&nbsp; It has implications not just on the individual but also the country.&nbsp; I would like to know what are the measures the Ministry has in place to effectively ensure the safety and quality of the food consumed by our citizens.&nbsp; How would they ensure that there are sufficient measures to prevent<p align=left>Column: 1316 </p> any lapse in the control?&nbsp; Are there any plans for education awareness in this aspect?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

It was also reported that India and China banned rice exports recently, with China being cited to have done so to meet domestic demand.&nbsp; As Singapore imports more than 90% of our food from overseas, what is AVA's risk management approach towards an uninterrupted food supply, apart from broadening our external food sources?&nbsp; A diversified external food sources approach may ensure stability in the supply chain for Singapore in the short term.&nbsp; But if a worldwide food shortage crisis occurs, this approach may not be effective.&nbsp; Furthermore, political pressure in a food shortage crisis will force many food producing countries to ban exports so as to meet domestic demand first.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</B> Sir, I thank Members for raising the issues of food supply, food safety as well as food inflation.&nbsp; These are issues that are very intricately linked.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensuring food safety has always been the key priority for AVA, as it adopts a science-based risk management strategy in line with international standards and benchmarked with the best practices.&nbsp; Food items that carry a higher risk of contamination are inspected more frequently and subject to systematic sampling of testing to detect food-borne pathogens, residues and contaminants.&nbsp; Despite numerous press reports concerning the safety of Chinese food products, as Mr Teo had mentioned earlier, the rejection rate for food imports from China is comparable with the overall rejection rate for food imports over the last three years.&nbsp; AVA will remain vigilant, and may introduce additional programmes and checks if necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A robust and effective food safety management system ensures that our import requirements are adequate but not overly stringent.&nbsp; It provides the necessary bedrock to give us the confidence and latitude to consider various strategies to enhance supply resilience and manage food inflation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversification of supply sources, backed by AVA's food safety regime, will remain a key strategy to ensure supply resilience. &nbsp;Diversification enables us to switch quickly to alternative sources to deal with supply disruptions in one or several sources, regardless of whether the disruptions are caused by disease outbreaks, bad weather in certain places affecting crop yields, or temporary export <p align=left>Column: 1318 </p>bans.&nbsp; AVA has been working closely with the industry on our food diversification strategy for many years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The food industry manages short-term demand and supply fluctuations through their business continuity plans.&nbsp; These include holding buffer stocks and pre-identifying alternative sources or substitute products.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now&nbsp;address the issue of food inflation raised by Members.&nbsp; The recent trend of rising food prices is a global phenomenon.&nbsp; In 2007, many countries experienced considerable food inflation.&nbsp; Food prices went up by 12.3% in China, 11.2% in Vietnam, and 4% in the US last year.&nbsp; Adverse climate, diversion of agricultural land to produce bio-fuel crops, rising fuel prices, as well as increased consumption in emerging countries like China and India, have all contributed to rising food prices.&nbsp; As we import the bulk of our food, we cannot be totally insulated from this global effect.&nbsp; In 2007, food prices in Singapore rose by 2.9%. <p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Masagos is right.&nbsp; Subsidies and price controls are not the way to go. &nbsp;To mitigate food inflation, our approach has been to keep our market open so that importers can source for food items from diverse sources at the most competitive prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our diversification effort has yielded positive outcomes.&nbsp; For example, taking year-on-year comparison for 2007, the import prices of chicken and pork had not risen significantly, hovering at about 1% on average.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is doing more to mitigate the impact of food inflation.&nbsp; We are working on further diversifying our sources.&nbsp; AVA is expediting the approvals of more countries and establishments to export to us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To open up even more sources, we also need to be innovative and explore<p align=left>Column: 1319 </p> new ways to bring in the food safely.&nbsp; One innovation which AVA piloted recently was the sea-freighting of chilled pork from Australia.&nbsp; This has opened up an alternative logistic channel which has the potential to bring down the import prices of chilled pork, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we need more than the Government and industry efforts to mitigate the impact of food inflation.&nbsp; Consumers have an important role to play in managing their cost of living.&nbsp; They can manage their expenditure on non-cooked foods through various options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, they can switch to frozen meat, which are typically around 20% cheaper than chilled meat.&nbsp; Some cuts can go even up to 53% cheaper, such as chicken wings and drumsticks, while frozen pork loins are about 38% cheaper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have received anecdotal feedback that some consumers are unwilling to use frozen meat.&nbsp; The perception is that it is less fresh and tasty.&nbsp; It is somewhat ironic that some of them would buy chilled meat, only to freeze it for use some days later.&nbsp; Many people also may not realise that we have been consuming frozen food, such as frozen chicken and pork, which is used widely by the food industries, restaurants and hawkers for preparing their cooked or processed food.&nbsp; In fact, the consumption of both frozen pork and chicken in Singapore last year was about 60% of the total demand for pork and chicken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to help consumers make informed decisions, AVA has embarked on a public education programme to raise awareness on the availability of frozen meats, educate consumers on the proper handling of frozen meat products, and dispel the misconception that frozen meat is not fresh, tasty or wholesome.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, consumers who are willing to make adjustments to their preferences for basic food items also have other options.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1320 </p>For most food items, including cooking oil, rice and bread, there are many other varieties and brands that consumers can choose from.&nbsp; For example, house-brand items offered by retailers are 10% to 15% cheaper on average.&nbsp; Consumers can also shop around for promotions which give them greater value for dollar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has also asked on the feasibility of Singapore producing its own food.&nbsp; In land-scarce Singapore, we cannot rely on expanding agricultural land to supply the amount or variety of food for the whole population.&nbsp; This is neither viable nor practical.&nbsp; We have, however, invested in a certain degree of local food production by exploiting technology, as Mr Low has suggested. &nbsp;One example is our long-term plan to develop the aquaculture sector, as fish harvest from wild catch is expected to drop over the years. AVA has invested in high-value upstream technology to produce robust fish frys, which is the weakest link in food fish production. &nbsp;Notwithstanding this, given our land size, there would still be a need for us to partner regional players for the grow-out phase to be carried out beyond our shores.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government will continue to monitor the food safety, supply and price situation.&nbsp; We will remain vigilant and work closely with the industry. &nbsp;We will step up our efforts to raise awareness on the availability of food choices to enable consumers to make practical and informed decisions.&nbsp; More importantly, consumers must recognise their role and play their part in managing the impact of food inflation.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; There is some time for clarifications.&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo:</B> Sir, could I seek clarification from Minister on the Lease Buy-Back system (LBS)?&nbsp; I am happy&nbsp;with<p align=left>Column: 1321 </p> the Minister's assurance on the provision of continued stay&nbsp;in the flats under LBS even if the mortgagee should live beyond 30 years.&nbsp; May I ask him what will happen to the rest of the lease should the mortgagee not use up the 30 years?&nbsp; My second question is that:&nbsp; is the $490 mentioned earlier by him on the steady income for life for one or two mortgagees for each flat under LBS?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> First of all, on the lease itself, if the lessee outlives the 30 years, we will look for alternative housing arrangements for them.&nbsp; But if they do not outlive the 30-year lease, then whatever is remaining in the lease, they are able to return it to the Government.&nbsp; The example that I quoted of about $490 per month for life is for the flat itself.&nbsp; In other words, if that&nbsp;is a two-person family, then it will be $490 for two.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Sir, the first question is:&nbsp; is Hougang denied MUP since it is confirmed that MUP is now&nbsp;being replaced by HIP and NRP?&nbsp; Second, what is the average cost per flat of MUP that the flat owners will benefit?&nbsp; Third, why replace MUP with HIP and NRP?

There is the improvement to be done to the unit itself, the improvement to be done to the block, including the lifts, and the third component, which is to the precincts.&nbsp; So if you like, MUP was the omnibus kind of upgrading programme. Now that we have committed to do LUP for all eligible flats<p align=left>Column: 1322 </p> by 2014, you will find that the MUP is no longer suitable for some of the blocks that have undergone the middle portion, which is the block level upgrading. And, therefore, what is left in the MUP for some of these flats, which have undergone LUP, remains the problem to rectify defects within the flats, including some of the upgrading of the pipes and so on, and the precinct.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the programme is restructured, and if you like, into three parts - HIP which looks inside the flat; LUP which brings lift access to every floor; and NRP, which deals with precinct upgrading. So this restructuring is relevant because of what we are doing with LUP. The fact that we are bringing LUP, the lift part, upfront, by 2014, to all the eligible flats,&nbsp;requires us to restructure MUP.&nbsp; And also, it is to take in the&nbsp;feedback, such as what Ms Lee has pointed out, that there are defects in some of the middle aged flats that many of the residents have voiced concerns. They want Government to do something and do it fast.&nbsp; So how do we have a programme that basically addresses the specific needs, and because it is very targeted and very focused, we think that we can do it faster than the traditional MUP? And of course, the improvement that we have done to MUP is the fact that MUP was previously limited to flats that were built before 1980.&nbsp; But in the case of HIP, we have brought the eligibility to 1986. So this is not a case of Hougang residents being denied an MUP. This MUP actually has been replaced for all divisions and locations in Singapore, whether you are PAP or non-PAP divisions. So this is the reason for replacing MUP with HIP and NRP.&nbsp; There is a need to restructure the scheme and also taking in the&nbsp;feedback that residents have given us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is still the Government's intention to have asset enhancement.&nbsp;In fact, I think for HIP, the residents co-pay a smaller percentage than under the MUP project.&nbsp; In<p align=left>Column: 1323 </p> that case, we hope that, being a more specific project, we are able to deal with a larger pool of eligible flats.&nbsp; But the basic fundamental remains the same, that this is not an entitlement. The fact that you are eligible, it does not entitle you to an upgrading.&nbsp; It depends on the kind of resources that we have.&nbsp; It will have to depend on the kind of budget that is given to us and, therefore, the pace has to be prioritised.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> The question on what is the average cost of MUP has not been answered&nbsp;and what is the projected cost for HIP, and whether the house owner will receive almost the same amount.&nbsp; Would the Minister of State agree that while it is not an entitlement to everybody,&nbsp;you are using the national budget? It involves application of funds,&nbsp;and application of funds has to be fair to everybody.&nbsp; So it is important to know&nbsp;how much each household will benefit.

The fund application of the Town Council will benefit only part of block, it is unfair since&nbsp;the fund application cannot benefit everybody in the block. That was the reason&nbsp;we were turned down.&nbsp; Now, it is the turn of MND to use the&nbsp;national budget to fund upgrading programmes. So I want to know how do we apply the fund equally and justifiably to everybody. She has also not answered&nbsp;the question of HIP. How many more years do we want Hougang to wait?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien--><p align=left>Column: 1324 </p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien:</B> I think this issue about what is that average cost per unit and what is the cost per project is not relevant.&nbsp; Because if it is really relevant, then we will not be undertaking upgrading for some of the more difficult blocks. There are some blocks existing, for example, like lift upgrading, which is relatively simple that the TC can carry out - less than $5,000 per benefiting unit.&nbsp; But there are some blocks which require up to a budget of $30,000 per benefiting unit. So this is not an issue&nbsp;about \"<I>fen hong</I>\", everybody <I>fen</I> a little bit.&nbsp; It is not a case that you have a standard allocation of funds to each unit.&nbsp; We have to look at the blocks to see&nbsp;what is required to bring lift access to the floors. The blocks are built in different ages and different times so they have different configurations. Therefore, the cost required to bring lifts to every floor is different. And that has been our principle that we adopt. What we have is a cost cap. And that cost cap is preventing too much financial resources being devoted into specific blocks or specific precincts.&nbsp; That is really to make sure that we do not over-spend and to reduce wastage.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the same rationale, we cannot insist that every block must get a fair allocation because the blocks are different and so their requirements are different. Some blocks need less to bring lifts to every floor. Some blocks need less to do MUP or IUP. Some blocks do not need MUP, for example, they are not eligible for MUP.&nbsp; To the residents, is there an issue of fairness?&nbsp; It is not.&nbsp; To us, it is an issue of needs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the pace of HIP, this is&nbsp;a very new project.&nbsp; In fact, we are only piloting in several precincts in Singapore. We will look at how we would want to pace up this project. Again, the length in which we are going to carry out the entire stock of flats will depend on the kind of budgets that we have. At the moment, our focus<p align=left>Column: 1325 </p> is to complete LUP by 2014, and that is receiving the most of our attention. For that, Hougang residents can look forward to by 2014.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Lee Bee Wah:</B> Sir, by the way, residents in Nee Soon South are also waiting for the HIP. I would like to seek a few clarifications. Firstly, the Minister mentioned that HDB is building basic flats as well as some higher-end HDB flats to fulfil the varying needs of Singaporeans. I would like to ask the Minister:&nbsp; since the private sector is capable of building higher-end housing, should HDB just be restricted to build the very basic flats? The next clarification is that just now, MOS mentioned that HDB repairs some flats without charge if it is due to design or workmanship problems. I would like to ask how many units HDB has done under this \"repair without charge\".&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next clarification is, just now, I mentioned about the leakage,&nbsp;ie, those recurring leakages in an HDB flat. I would like to urge HDB to scrutinise the repair method of contractors, produce guidelines and good practices so that these leakages do not keep coming back and inconvenience the residents. The next point is that&nbsp;we are competing for construction resources. Are we confident that important projects, such as the Youth Olympic Game Village, can be completed on time?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last&nbsp;clarification is:&nbsp; just now, it was mentioned that there is upgrading of parks by the National Parks Board.&nbsp; I would like to know how many parks will be upgraded under this scheme.&nbsp; By the way, for EUP, from the number that was benefiting&nbsp;last year, I think we will wait for a very long time.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> Mdm Lee Bee Wah asked why is HDB not just sticking to basic flats. The answer is very simple. HDB's public housing programme reaches <p align=left>Column: 1326 </p>out, as I said in my reply, to 80% of Singaporeans. That is far from basic.&nbsp; So we are talking about people who are earning $1,500 as well as people who are earning $8,000. The household who is earning $8,000 wants a different type of flat from the household who is able to afford $1,500. We have got, first of all, different flat types - two-room, three-room, four-room, five-room, etc.&nbsp; Then even within the flat types, within the four-room flat type, we have got 4As, 4Is, etc.&nbsp; We have five-room flats, Executive flats and Executive Condominiums.&nbsp; If we want the public housing programme to remain as something that more Singaporeans, within that target group, still value and treasure, we will have to look into their aspirations and see what is it that they want.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember at one time,&nbsp; lessees were throwing out the old doors and the old flooring and re-doing their own, putting their own flooring, doors and windows because the old ones were not good enough.&nbsp; In the end, all of these were wasted. So HDB said, \"Look.&nbsp; Instead of you putting your own doors, floorings, etc, why don't I put in better flooring and doors for you? Why don't I put in different bathrooms for you?\"&nbsp; And so it went on. The fact of the matter is that Singaporeans' aspirations are going up. That is the reason why HDB cannot just stick to building basic flats.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next question she asked is:&nbsp; why are we building DBSS flats?&nbsp; As I explained, and I would like to reiterate, DBSS flats will constitute less than 1% of the total stock.&nbsp; This 1% will be a kind of flats which will have a different look, perhaps even a different flavour, but still ultimately, within the HDB umbrella. Why?&nbsp; Because they are targeted at the HDB flat buyers.&nbsp; Two, they will still be maintained by the Town Council because one of the requirements that we have put in is that these flats that the private sector builds must be maintainable. We make it clear to<p align=left>Column: 1327 </p> them what type of maintenance we want to conduct on these flats and the Town Council must also agree that this is the kind of maintenance that they are able to conduct on these flats.&nbsp; So whether it is the facades or the precinct facilities, it is maintainable.&nbsp; So no swimming pool, no tennis court, those kind of things, because we want the maintenance cost to be kept manageable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

First of all, she mentioned about the cost cap per unit.&nbsp; What is the cost cap?&nbsp; And what is the average cost per unit of Government expenditure on MUP?&nbsp; She says that now the HIP is based on need.&nbsp; I would like her to clarify&nbsp;whether MUP was based on need as well because the principle is different.&nbsp; I note that&nbsp;for MUP project,&nbsp;carparks were upgraded&nbsp;and some of the flats even got IUP first.&nbsp;&nbsp;Linkways&nbsp;were built and when MUP came,&nbsp;the&nbsp;linkways were torn down and&nbsp;another type of linkway was built.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;is MUP based on need?&nbsp; It is based on asset&nbsp;enhancement, enhancing the whole area and now&nbsp;she is&nbsp;telling me that it is based on need.&nbsp; So why is the discrepancy in the philosophy and principle of&nbsp;&nbsp;using public funds to benefit different households and, depending on your luck whether you are selected first?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is not fair to those&nbsp;who are not being selected,&nbsp;not only in Hougang but perhaps in PAP wards as well.&nbsp; Because they do not receive the benefits&nbsp;from the government&nbsp;expenditure&nbsp;put in to enhance their flats and the property agent will tell&nbsp;you, \"Yes, those who have MUP, the flat prices&nbsp;are higher.\"&nbsp; How&nbsp;do you explain&nbsp;that?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on HIP, I think&nbsp;she&nbsp;has not answered a question.&nbsp; Since MUP is now broken into HIP, LUP and Neighbourhood Renewal Programme (NRP),&nbsp;she has said that Hougang residents can look forward to LUP.&nbsp;

Secondly,&nbsp;I would like to, in a way, correct the perception that because upgrading programme is an asset enhancement and, therefore, every Singaporean household must get the same amount of funds from the Government.&nbsp; I think that is not the right principle to treat upgrading programmes.&nbsp; The upgrading programme is basically customised by flat type&nbsp;based on their age.&nbsp; For example, for someone who has just gotten a new flat, why would she want a MUP?&nbsp; It is just not relevant to the person.&nbsp; So for someone who has just bought a new flat in Sengkang, would she then turn around and say, &nbsp;\"I am&nbsp;entitled for MUP because I am one of the Singapore families.\"?&nbsp; So this is not the way that&nbsp;we look at upgrading programme.&nbsp; It is our way to revitalise estates, as&nbsp;I have mentioned in my speech.&nbsp; We want to basically upgrade the older estates so that it is revitalised and it does not progress into a dilapidated state where only old people who cannot afford to move out remain.&nbsp; We want to attract young people to come in as well.&nbsp; So that is the purpose of the upgrading project.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In trying to be responsive, HDB saw that this was the queue - 147,000 people were waiting for flats - so they started building.&nbsp; So they built, and they built.&nbsp; Then, when the financial crisis hit, the 147,000 people disappeared.&nbsp; By which stage, HDB already had 20,000 flats built.&nbsp; Where were the buyers?&nbsp; \"Sorry, you know, we are not interested anymore.\"&nbsp; \"But I thought you said you were interested?\"&nbsp; \"Oh, no, we were just queuing.\"&nbsp; And that is the reason why we said no more.&nbsp; That was not the real demand, so we went for the BTO system.&nbsp; So the question is: is this a \"<I>tikam-tikam</I> \"?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; In the case of the recent BTOs that we have launched, everybody who wants a flat is able to get a flat.&nbsp; In fact, there are flats still left over.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have said, there are 700 flats still left over from recent BTO exercises.&nbsp; So nobody needs to \"<I>tikam-tikam</I>\".&nbsp; They can go to HDB and they can actually register for a flat, say, in Sengkang or Punggol.&nbsp; So where is the balloting issue?&nbsp; The balloting problem comes from those who are balloting for the small limited number of flats in the mature estates.&nbsp; 10,000 balloting for 300, right?&nbsp; And then another maybe 8,000 balloting for 200 flats.&nbsp; That is where the problem arises.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I asked HDB to check, because this was a very constant feedback.&nbsp; Many<p align=left>Column: 1332 </p> young couples said, \"I ballot five times, six times, I cannot get, you know \"<I>tikam-tikam</I> \", what am I going to do?\".&nbsp; So I asked HDB whether this is true.&nbsp; This is what they told me.&nbsp; In the last six years, 250 first-timers, not 10,000, who applied for a flat in more than four HDB sales exercises were repeatedly unsuccessful.&nbsp; That means 250 people were unsuccessful for at least four times.&nbsp; This is less than one percent of the first-timer applicants applying for a new HDB flat.&nbsp; So I said how can that be?&nbsp; What has happened?&nbsp; Surely people are not telling me lies.&nbsp; Then they probed further and they discovered that among these 250, four out of five of them, applied only for flats in the established towns.&nbsp; In other words, they do not want Sengkang or Punggol.&nbsp; They do not want Jurong West.&nbsp; They only want Bukit Merah.&nbsp; They only want Tiong Bahru.&nbsp; They only want Telok Blangah.&nbsp; They are not interested in everything else.&nbsp; So they kept on applying.&nbsp; You just do the mathematics.&nbsp; If you have 10,000 queuing up for 200 flats, what are your chances of getting it?&nbsp; Even if I give you four tickets, what are your chances?&nbsp; And this is really the issue.&nbsp; And that is why I have been repeatedly advising these young couples: are you really in need of a flat?&nbsp; If you are really in need of a flat very urgently, please consider a resale flat because you can get resale flats anywhere in Singapore.&nbsp; And if you tell me, \"Oh, it is too expensive\", I ask you again, \"What is your budget?\"&nbsp; If you cannot buy a five-room flat in a mature estate, because it costs so much money, then consider Toa Payoh, which this reporter that I cited did.&nbsp; She bought a Toa Payoh flat, zero cash over valuation.&nbsp; Or if you are not interested in Toa Payoh, then maybe you can consider Tampines or Woodlands.&nbsp; Or Yishun.&nbsp; Anywhere.&nbsp; So if you are really desperate, this is your option.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you can wait and you want a new flat, there is another option for you, <p align=left>Column: 1333 </p>try for the BTO.&nbsp; There is a good chance you will get it.&nbsp; However, if you say you only want above fourth floor, above fifth floor, above sixth floor, then again we are back to square one.&nbsp; I am sorry.&nbsp; And this is what has happened.&nbsp; That is the reason why when we had 500 flats in the BTO we had 1,000-over people applying but, in the end, only 400 people booked a flat.&nbsp; What happened?&nbsp; Many of them came and they said, \"I do not like the facing, I do not like the floor, I do not like this, I do not like that, I do not want it.\"&nbsp; So they went off.&nbsp; And that is the reason why we still have spare flats available.&nbsp; So when we hear such stories, when your constituents come to you, ask them whether they have tried other places, have they tried BTO in Sengkang.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

If HDB is really committed to building affordable housing and there is a certain cap on the&nbsp;family income, I certainly agree with the&nbsp;Minister that we should not just&nbsp;build basic housing.&nbsp;

But should the&nbsp;HDB not be looking at&nbsp;the highest end, say,&nbsp;up to $8,000, what is the affordability, and work backwards?&nbsp; In order not to encourage an over-commitment and over-spending on&nbsp;housing, we should,&nbsp;if&nbsp;we think that the most comfortable mortgage payment is a certain amount,&nbsp;work backwards and see how much&nbsp;these flats should be.&nbsp; If&nbsp;the maximum is $200,000 or&nbsp;$300,000, then we should build according to&nbsp;affordability.&nbsp; Then, this is&nbsp;real affordable housing.&nbsp; Because I noted that flats built, say,&nbsp;20 years ago probably were sold at maybe&nbsp;one or two years of the average&nbsp;earnings of a graduate.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, nowadays, at the high-end, if you say $750,000 -</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> I think, basically, what the Member is asking is for us to have a cap on the house price.&nbsp; Can I summarise it like that?&nbsp; The Member is saying, \"Let's put a cap on the price of a HDB flat\".&nbsp; Or, in the case of DBSS, let us put a cap on it - not more than $700,000.&nbsp; If we were to adopt that suggestion, then the next thing is that we would also have to have a cap for resale flats.&nbsp; If you say, let us put a cap on the price of a new flat, then surely the argument also holds for a resale flat, because the next person who comes to me will say, \"I cannot afford that Bukit Merah flat that was sold for over $800,000.&nbsp; Why did the Government allow that flat to be sold for that price?&nbsp; I cannot afford.\"&nbsp; Then, we are in a very dangerous situation.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my point is, let us make sure that the prices are affordable for new flats.&nbsp; For resale flats, let us allow the market to<p align=left>Column: 1335 </p> set the price.&nbsp; I think Singaporeans understand this but, of course, when they buy a flat from the Government they want to have it as low as possible, the lower the better.&nbsp; So there are all these arguments about why new flat prices are so high.&nbsp; Why do you base it on market?&nbsp; Why do you not base it on cost, and so on?&nbsp; But when the same person sells the flat, he forgets about all these arguments.&nbsp; He wants to sell the flat at market price, the higher the better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a system whereby we allow our people to enjoy a subsidy first time and then if the market goes up, enjoy the increase in value of the flat, because that increase in value of the flat is his safety net for old age, his hedge against inflation.&nbsp; So we want people to enjoy the fruits of Singapore's progress.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why should we put a cap to it?&nbsp; So similarly for new flats, we will subsidise him.&nbsp; In the case of the DBSS flat, priced at $700,000, for example, that was set by the developer.&nbsp; I am not saying that it is too high or too low.&nbsp; It is for the buyer to decide whether it is too high or too low, and not for the Government.&nbsp; If the flat price is too high, do not buy, walk away, forget about it, and say, \"I am not going to buy this.\" Why must you buy that flat priced at $700,000, which happens to be a high floor price?&nbsp; Why can you not buy a lower floor?&nbsp; Why can you not buy a cheaper flat?&nbsp;&nbsp; You have the option, I am not forcing you to buy a $700,000 flat.&nbsp; However, if the flat is considered to be good value, then you make the decision.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, that is how we have always operated.&nbsp; Even for our new HDB flats, we say, \"These are the flat prices.&nbsp; If you want a flat in Bukit Merah, it will be more expensive than the same flat in Punggol or Sengkang.\"&nbsp; It has to be.&nbsp; The person cannot come to me and say, \"Why is it that your flat in Bukit Merah is so expensive?&nbsp; The same flat in Punggol is cheaper.\"&nbsp; So, we have to take the market signals, we have to let the market set the <p align=left>Column: 1336 </p>price. Then, to make it affordable, HDB will provide the subsidies.&nbsp; In the case of the DBSS flat, if you buy a DBSS flat and if you are eligible, you will get the subsidy of $30,000 or $40,000.&nbsp; That will help to lower your loan.&nbsp; If it is still too much and you still cannot afford, please do not buy.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there are people who can afford, even at $8,000.&nbsp; Maybe they have got parents who will give them a loan, provide them with a start-up fund, or whatever.&nbsp; I do not know.&nbsp; But if they want to buy, it is up to them.&nbsp; But exercise prudence, do not take a bigger loan than you can afford.&nbsp; And if you are taking a loan from HDB, we are going to conduct credit assessment.&nbsp; We are not giving you a loan based on $700,000.&nbsp; We are going to give you a loan based on what you can afford to pay back.&nbsp; That is how we exercise prudence.&nbsp; But I would advise that we do not start thinking about putting a cap on HDB prices because you never know what you are wishing for.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If the&nbsp;highest of our $8,000 income household can afford certain amount, then HDB should not build flats that&nbsp;are above this amount.&nbsp; It is not that we cap&nbsp;the&nbsp;flat price regardless of what is the cost but rather you see how much they can afford, then we build up to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is different because&nbsp;the flat&nbsp;is worth only that much and you encourage people to be prudent because we think this is the best.&nbsp; If you really want to go beyond your means and do not exercise prudence, then you should go and buy a private condominium or private apartment and&nbsp;you face the risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the market take the risk since this is a market economy and HDB should not be in that business.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> I may have mistaken the Member in that respect.&nbsp; In other<p align=left>Column: 1337 </p> words, he is saying, do not build DBSS flats, for example.&nbsp; I think that is essentially what he is saying.&nbsp; However, as I have explained, DBSS is a special category meant for those 1% or so buyers, who would really like something special.&nbsp; Again, it may or may not work.&nbsp; For example, the next DBSS project, I believe, is now open for sale.&nbsp; I do not know what the results are.&nbsp; Will the flats be sold out?&nbsp; Again, I do not know.&nbsp; But that is the test of affordability.&nbsp; If people are prepared to pay, get a loan to pay for it, and they think it is good value, so be it.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line perhaps with what the Member is suggesting, we have specified that there must be some 4-room or smaller flats in that development.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because we want to have some 3-room, 4-room and 5-room flat people living there together.&nbsp; We would not allow him to just build all 5-room flats, even though that may be what makes him the most profit.&nbsp; So there is some moderating of the flat type.&nbsp; There is also some moderating of the features because we do not want him to go overboard on the features.&nbsp; So, those are some of the moderating influences that we have introduced.&nbsp; But I am reluctant to say that you cannot sell your flat more than this amount of money.&nbsp; We actually did consider that at one stage, to put a cap on the selling price, ie, you cannot sell the flat more than this amount.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens then, of course, is that you have got to start to check what is it that they are putting into the flat.&nbsp; The experience in Hong Kong, which had a similar scheme, was that they started to cut corners on all their materials, construction, and so on.&nbsp; Because if you cap the selling price, then, to maximise the profit, they start to squeeze on the cost, I think that is not what we want to have.&nbsp; The Hong Kong experience was <p align=left>Column: 1338 </p>quite salutary for us and that is the reason why we did not go in that direction.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Second clarification.&nbsp; She said that the cost cap in HIP and average cost per flat of MUP&nbsp;may not be meaningful.&nbsp; Surely, I think she would agree that this has something to do with the transparency of Government expenditure;&nbsp;moreover, MUP and IUP spend a lot of money,&nbsp;eg, IUP at $6,000 per unit.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
