Contrary to the perception that improving productivity will result in job losses, productivity improvements can in fact help our economy and our enterprises remain competitive and save jobs for our workers &ndash; young and old, men and women, rank and file workers as well as Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs). Raising productivity will also strengthen Singapore's position as an attractive investment location for growth industries. This will in turn create more quality jobs for Singaporeans.&nbsp;Specifically for older workers, despite the severe downturn in 2009, they have maintained their employment rate at 57% for those aged 55-64. The Government will continue to work closely with the Tripartite partners in preparing employers and employees for the re-employment legislation which will come into effect in 2012.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me share with you an example of how older workers can benefit&nbsp;from the productivity drive and automation. Hai's Pte Ltd, which specialises in the&nbsp;production of pre-mix and premium sauces for the food service industry, redesigned its jobs across the entire production process with the deployment of semi-automated equipment. The result is an improvement in productivity of its mature workers by as much as 30%, and&nbsp;the tasks are now physically less demanding and easier to handle. The mature workers can also apply different skills and talents through functional job rotation, and gain new skills through training. They have become more motivated at work and the company can now offer more job opportunities for mature workers as it expands its operations.&nbsp;Even as companies redesign workplaces, processes and jobs to create higher value and better leverage on the silver workforce, workers need to play their part by picking up skills and actively <p align=left>Column: 2178</p>upgrading themselves to take on higher value jobs. The Government will continue to support the efforts of employers and workers in skills upgrading, especially for the low-wage and low-skilled workers. More details will be announced shortly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo has asked about schemes to boost productivity.&nbsp; Details will also be announced shortly.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B> &nbsp;Thank you, Minister for the very comprehensive response. Sir, the whole notion of productivity is about more output and better rewards.&nbsp; How do we reconcile this with the perception that older workers are less energetic and slower, and hence, to be pro-business, we need to reduce their compensation and rewards in two areas?&nbsp;Upon reaching 50 years of age, older workers face a reduction in CPF contribution and upon retirement, if they are found to be fit for re-employment, they are often re-employed at a reduced package. How we reconcile productivity with incentives in this instance? I would like to have Minister's comment on this.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:&nbsp;</B>Sir, the tripartite partners and the Ministry of Manpower have been working over the last few years to encourage our employers to adopt flexible wage systems that reflect the performance of our workers. We have also been working with the unions to encourage our workers to accept these arrangements and therefore, if our workers are able to be compensated according to the performance, then the seniority wage system will become less of an obstacle to older workers staying employed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, the tripartite partners have also been working very hard to upgrade the skills of our workers to ensure that their skills remain relevant to the industries that are created. By doing so, we will ensure and help older workers <p align=left>Column: 2179</p>share and benefit from economic growth. Later on, Minister for Finance will announce additional measures on how we can help these older workers go for training and upgrade themselves so that they can remain productive, enhance their performance and have a&nbsp;share of the profits of the company, so that we can also see their wages improve over time. There is no easy answer to this challenge. It is important for all parties to work together. The Government will provide the necessary schemes. Companies and employers will have to recognise the contributions by older workers and design their compensation according to the performance of the older workers. The older and low-skilled workers, themselves, also have to put in the effort to upskill so that they can take on higher value jobs.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Heng Chee How)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Heng Chee How):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, supplementary question. I would like to ask if the Minister would agree that there are also many employers out there who do appreciate the value of their older workers and what they bring to the job and the company. In last year's economy, for example, the employment rate for the older workers actually went up. The results for the unionised sector, for example, have also been very good.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B>&nbsp; Yes, I agree, Sir.&nbsp; In fact, in my reply earlier, I did mention that the employment rate for older workers in 2009, despite the recession, maintained at 57%. This is encouraging but it still requires us to continue to put in more effort to help prepare our workers for the re-employment which will come into effect by 2012.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tripartite partners have been working together on this and we will be rolling out tripartite guidelines on re-employment shortly. We have put out the <p align=left>Column: 2180</p>draft guidelines and we are now consulting and getting feedback from our stakeholders. We will refine this set of draft guidelines and the finalised guidelines will be rolled out shortly.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

The first is in regard to an elaboration, if Minister could, to tell us a little about the incentives that the Ministry&nbsp;has in place to encourage, particularly, SMEs to provide training for older workers who are nearing retirement, 62 years old, and who may want to continue employment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second supplementary question, Sir, relates to the new national council that will oversee productivity and CET. I wonder if the Minister could share with us who will constitute members of this new council. Will there be representation from the people sector, interest groups, particularly those who have vested interests in mature workers and their interests and rights?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my final supplementary question&nbsp;&ndash; there is a lot of emphasis on training to level up on skills. May I ask if training will be held within office hours to encourage a good worklife balance?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B> Mr Speaker, with regard to the incentives for SMEs to train older workers&nbsp;&ndash; we have the ADVANTAGE! Scheme that&nbsp;allows companies to tap on this scheme to prepare themselves for the employment of older workers. The ADVANTAGE! scheme has a programme \"ADVANTAGE! for SMEs\", which is targeted&nbsp;specifically at training SME&nbsp;employees especially the human resources managers so that they understand the challenges of the employment of older workers. Specific incentives to encourage the training of older workers, as I&nbsp;have mentioned,&nbsp;will be announced shortly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2181</p>The composition of the&nbsp;National Productivity Council (NPC), that the Member has mentioned, will also be announced in a short while. Finally, the Member talked about worklife balance and how&nbsp;we balance it with the need to go for training. It is something that we need to continue to work at. We want to ensure&nbsp;that we achieve worklife balance so that workers can be productive and at the same time we want to encourage workers to go on for training. So, particularly for the older and the lower-wage workers, the obstacle for training is quite substantial and significant. That is why, in a short while, Minister for Finance will be announcing specific incentives or how we can encourage older workers to overcome these training obstacles and go for training.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:BUILDING OF NEW HDB FLATS--><p align=left>Column: 2181<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:BUILDING OF NEW HDB FLATS:::2186--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>BUILDING OF NEW HDB FLATS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Build according to demand--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Build according to demand)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</B> asked the Minister for National Development whether there are plans to return to the Build-to-Sell mode for building new HDB flats as waiting three to four years for Build-to-Order flats affects many new applicants' resources and plans to start a family.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the current Build-To-Order (BTO) system was introduced in 2001. Prior to this, HDB adopted the Registration for Flats System (RFS), which is what the Member refers to as Build-to-Sell. Under the RFS, HDB built flats based on the number of applications in the queue. At the height of the property boom in the mid-90s, there were 150,000 applicants in the queue, and the waiting time for flats was between six and seven&nbsp;years. When the Asian Financial Crisis struck in 1997, the 150,000 applications in the queue dissipated and HDB was left with 31,000 unsold flats.</p><p align=left>Column: 2182</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB took five years to clear its stock of unsold flats. Having such a large stock of unsold flats is a waste of public money, as many Members in this House pointed out at that time. That is why HDB has decided to build only upon confirmation of demand. Under the BTO system, construction will commence once the majority of the flats in a project are booked and downpayments are made. The time required to construct a typical HDB block takes about three years. This is no different from buying private properties. This certainty of being able to collect the keys to a new flat in three years in fact helps the flat buyers in their planning, and gives them time to save up for their renovation and purchase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate couples in planning ahead, HDB has introduced the Fianc&eacute;/Fianc&eacute;e Scheme to allow courting couples to apply and book a flat ahead of their marriage.&nbsp; Hence, the couples will have a new home when they are ready to get married.&nbsp; About 30% of first-time flat buyers make use of this scheme currently. For those who prefer to have a flat immediately, the resale market offers a wide range of flats in different locations, but at market prices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My advice to young flat buyers is to plan ahead and to buy a flat within their means.&nbsp; For those who apply for BTO flats in non-mature estates, the vast majority will be invited to select a flat within two tries.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask Minister to clarify. There is a time lapse between the applicants applying for the flat and meeting the HDB's requirement before the flats are built. Minister promised a three-year construction period. But what is the time period between&nbsp;the point when the first applicant applies and the time&nbsp;HDB decides, or for the requirement to be met, for that precinct to be built? So,&nbsp;three years refer to&nbsp;only the construction <p align=left>Column: 2183</p>period. There is also another time period before the go-ahead for construction. So, what is the average time in total, for the precinct to be built for the past BTO projects?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B> &nbsp; I think the Member has a point in that there is a certain time period from&nbsp;booking&nbsp;a flat and before construction starts. The amount of time needed is really for HDB to process the applications and also to press the button in order to start the construction. That time lapse is not very long because usually, after the bookings are made, the contract would be let out.&nbsp; It is not a very significant amount of time. What may lengthen the process is really the number of tries that the person or the couple may be putting in to get that first booking. I mentioned in my reply that under the current&nbsp;rate of rolling out BTO projects&nbsp;&ndash; which is once a month&nbsp;&ndash; the chances of the person being successful in getting&nbsp;to book a flat is actually very high. In other words, the time taken to book a flat is&nbsp;now considerably shortened. So, if you add that time, in total, you would probably add a couple of months to six months, to the whole process. That is the order of magnitude that we are talking about. Obviously, it varies from project to project and it varies from person to person but on average, that is the order of magnitude.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would just like to seek a clarification with Minister.

So I think we should keep the system.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Speaker</B>:&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan</B>:&nbsp; I think this question is similar to Mdm Cynthia Phua's question just now which I have answered.&nbsp; Just to reiterate the answer, there is no additional time involved in meeting the 75% because once the bookings&nbsp;close&nbsp;&ndash; and there is between 70%-75% of bookings&nbsp;&ndash; then we will proceed to build.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, since we started the system, all,&nbsp;except for one that I remember,&nbsp;the&nbsp;BTO projects actually proceeded.&nbsp; So, this hurdle rate <p align=left>Column: 2186</p>of 70% is not difficult to achieve.&nbsp; On the other hand, it does give us a fairly comfortable assurance that if we proceed to build, there will not be an oversupply.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Most flat buyers are able to select a Build-To-Order (BTO) flat in non-mature estates within two tries.&nbsp; HDB will offer 12,000 new BTO flats in 2010 or more, if there is demand.&nbsp; This will be supplemented by flats built under the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) as well as Executive Condominiums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2187</p>The Government also heavily subsidises the home-ownership programme to ensure that HDB flats remain within the reach of Singaporeans.&nbsp;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Sir,&nbsp;over the years, Singapore's flood-prone areas have been reduced from more than 3,000 hectares in the 1970s to 79 hectares today, or about 0.1% of Singapore&rsquo;s total land area. By 2011, PUB targets to further reduce flood-prone areas to 56 hectares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continually improve our flood management infrastructure and keep pace with increasing developments, PUB has an ongoing drainage improvement programme. This involves a dynamic review of rainfall patterns and their impact on flood prone areas, as well as&nbsp; areas where surface runoff is expected to increase in tandem with plans for greater urbanisation. For example, as part of the programme to cater for new developments in the Upper Bukit Timah area in 10 <p align=left>Column: 2188</p>to 15 years' time, PUB has plans to deepen and widen the first stage of the Bukit Timah Phase 1 Diversion Canal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, flooding incidents may still occur due to extreme storms such as the one on 19th November last year. To further mitigate the risk of flash floods, PUB carries out regular site surveillance and maintenance to ensure that our drains are kept free of chokage.&nbsp; PUB has installed water level sensors to monitor water levels in drains and canals within flood-prone areas and plans to expand the network of water level sensors to include other major waterways. This will provide early warning of impending floods and facilitate prompt deployment of officers to the potentially affected sites to clear any debris that may have accumulated and put up traffic warning signboards if necessary.&nbsp; PUB also taps on LTA's 24-hour CCTV system to monitor road conditions at over 500 locations.&nbsp; When&nbsp; flooding occurs, PUB alerts the public through the media of the situation and mitigation measures that are being taken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flooding incident on 19th November last year in the Bukit Timah area was caused by an exceptionally intense storm.&nbsp; In just two hours, 110 mm of rain fell, of which 92 mm fell between 1.20 pm and 1.50 pm.&nbsp; This was equivalent to about 40% of the typical rainfall for the entire month of November falling within half an hour.&nbsp; The high intensity of the rain that day caused the Bukit Timah Phase 1 Diversion Canal to overflow.&nbsp; This caused localised flooding along two stretches of Bukit Timah Road: from Coronation Road to Third Avenue and from Wilby Road to Blackmore Road. The junction of Sixth Avenue with Bukit Timah Road was also flooded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist affected residents, PUB deployed its staff and contractors to pump out floodwaters from the premises and clear the debris at affected roads.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2189</p>PUB also met up with the management of affected premises to advise them on implementing measures to better safeguard against floods such as building physical crests to prevent water from flowing into their basement car parks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would not be cost-effective to build a large and extensive drainage system that caters for all extremities.&nbsp; A balance is needed between setting aside more land and resources for drainage infrastructure and for other development requirements. But PUB will continue to regularly review its flood alleviation measures and continue to invest in drainage infrastructure so as to ensure an effective drainage network.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):&nbsp;</B> Thank you, Minister, for the comprehensive reply.&nbsp; The areas that the Minister discussed were all in my constituency.&nbsp; I was told that PUB worked overtime to drain&nbsp;and pump out, I think, about 30 hours worth of water and for that, thank you on behalf of the residents.&nbsp; However, I would like to seek two clarifications.&nbsp; The first is in relation to crest protection.&nbsp; Is there any way that&nbsp;PUB or the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources can work with developers before the development is T.O.P-ed to have mandatory crest protection for basement carparks?&nbsp; Secondly, the drainage system that the Minister talked about&nbsp;&ndash; and I understand that it comes from the Bukit Timah Canal and goes through Wilby Road as a tributary into Sungei Ulu Pandan and then to the Pandan Reservoir&nbsp;&ndash; how will all of these have no bottlenecks in order that drainage actually does go to the Pandan Reservoir?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

The work that PUB will start in the third quarter of this year to widen the canal and the diversion canal will help&nbsp;the water to be drained off quickly.&nbsp; But, at the end of the day, it is about clearing up the litter as much as possible because our canals do pick up a lot of litter.&nbsp; Going forward, what the PUB will do is to continue to work with our contractors to ensure that whenever there is a reported blockage, we will clear it immediately.&nbsp; And when the rainy season is coming, we will step up our manpower to check at those places located in low-lying areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mentioned in my reply, we will put in place these measures to ensure that we have some form of early warning system.&nbsp; We cannot prevent the kind of extreme event that occurred on 19th November last year, but if it does happen, I think the most important thing is our response.&nbsp; So, this is the assurance that I can give to the Member&nbsp;&ndash; that we will do our very best to ensure that we can reduce the impact as much as possible&nbsp;&ndash; but it will be impossible to design for such extremities.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:GREEN EFFORT IN SINGAPORE--><p align=left>Column: 2190<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:GREEN EFFORT IN SINGAPORE:::2192--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>GREEN EFFORT IN SINGAPORE</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Action plan--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Action plan)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Siong Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6.&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Siong Seng</B> asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (a) what action plan his <p align=left>Column: 2191</p>Ministry intends to adopt to step up the \"green effort\" in Singapore; and (b) what new or additional incentives will be introduced to encourage the business community to play an even greater role in achieving the targets set out in the plan.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

When the Police investigations were completed, the investigation papers were submitted to the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC).&nbsp; We are now proceeding with the Coroner's Inquiry into Mr Tong's death.&nbsp; The State Coroner conducted the first Mention of this case on 27th January this year.&nbsp; The Coroner's Inquiry will be held from 3rd to 10th March next month.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Police investigations revealed that the Romanian Embassy vehicle was not stolen and the driver of the vehicle at the time of the two accidents was Dr Silviu Ionescu, who was then the Charge d'Affaires of the Embassy.&nbsp; Dr Ionescu left Singapore on 17th December 2009, <p align=left>Column: 2193</p>ostensibly to seek medical treatment in Romania.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MFA has been in touch with the Romanian Embassy since the beginning of the&nbsp;investigations. We have stressed to the Embassy that it should cooperate fully with the Police.&nbsp; When the Police wanted to interview the Embassy's regular driver, a Romanian, MFA called in the Charge&nbsp;d'Affaires to request their cooperation.&nbsp; The Embassy&nbsp;agreed and the Police interviewed the driver.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 6th January 2010, the Romanian Ambassador, Mr Aurelian Neagu, who is resident in Tokyo, informed MFA that Dr Ionescu had been recalled from his post in Singapore with effect from 5th January 2010 and the case had been referred to the Romanian Prosecutor's Office to conduct an investigation. Ambassador Neagu also gave his assurance that Romania was ready to cooperate fully.&nbsp; He subsequently informed MFA that the Romanian Foreign Ministry had suspended Dr Ionescu from his duties with effect from 4th February 2010, after the Romanian Prosecutor's Office began the criminal investigation of Dr Ionescu on 2nd February 2010 on charges of&nbsp; \"manslaughter, unauthorised departure from a vehicle accident site, and misrepresentation\".&nbsp; Ambassador Neagu stated that this was the first step in their criminal procedure.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the dates for the Coroner's Inquiry were set, MFA summoned Ambassador Neagu from Tokyo to the Ministry on 11th February 2010.&nbsp; As the legal systems in Singapore and Romania are different, we explained our system of Coroner's Inquiries and sought clarifications on the Romanian system of investigations and prosecutions with regard to the criminal investigation of Dr Ionescu and the charges brought against him by the Romanian authorities.&nbsp; We also asked for more information on the status <p align=left>Column: 2194</p>of the criminal proceedings in Romania against Dr Ionescu.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same meeting, MFA formally requested&nbsp;via a Third Person Note (TPN) that Dr Ionescu return to Singapore to attend the Coroner's Inquiry.&nbsp; We pointed out to the Romanian Ambassador that if Dr Ionescu was, as he had claimed, not the driver, then it would clearly be in his own interest to attend or to have a lawyer represent him at the Inquiry to present his version of the events as well as to question&nbsp;witnesses.&nbsp; At the same time, MFA also formally requested by TPN the Embassy to waive the diplomatic immunity of the Embassy driver, Mr Trusca, so that he could give evidence at the Coroner's Inquiry.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MFA has also asked Ambassador Neagu if Romania could give Singapore an undertaking that Dr Ionescu would be prosecuted for what he had done in Singapore, and if found guilty, be sentenced to a criminal penalty that is commensurate with his actions.&nbsp; We were assured by Ambassador Neagu that Romania would follow the full extent of its own law.&nbsp; The Ambassador also assured us that he understood our concerns and that the Romanian people understood our concerns.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Romanian government has not yet responded officially to these TPNs. We trust that they will do so without undue delay as the Coroner's Inquiry will begin in March.&nbsp; There have been some media reports which at first quoted a Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman as saying that they would waive immunity for Mr Trusca to allow him to testify at the Coroner's Inquiry, but subsequent media reports quoting the current Charge d'Affaires of the Romanian Embassy merely stated that \"the decision will be communicated to the Singapore authorities as soon as possible\", implying that a decision has&nbsp;yet to be made.&nbsp; We are <p align=left>Column: 2195</p>seeking clarification from the Romanian Embassy on these apparently conflicting statements which in any case do not constitute an official reply to our TPN.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The media, quoting the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, had also reported that the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had informed Dr Ionescu of the TPN asking that he attend the Coroner's Inquiry but that it could not compel him to do so as he had already been suspended from the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&nbsp; But, again, we have yet to hear officially&nbsp;from the Romanian government on this.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meeting with Ambassador Neagu on 11th February 2010, MFA also sought clarification on Romanian media reports in which Dr Ionescu had alleged that this was a case of a \"set-up\" by the Singapore Government because he had been reporting on political activities in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp; We told Ambassador Neagu that if these media reports had accurately quoted Dr Ionescu, then he had made very serious allegations against the integrity of the Singapore Government which MFA categorically rejected as lacking any basis in fact.&nbsp; These allegations were also a gross insult to the victims of the accidents in December 2009.&nbsp; We gave the Ambassador facts that clearly showed Dr Ionescu's claim that he had been&nbsp;accused of being the driver in a hit-and-run accident in 2007 was entirely false. We made these representations public in a MFA press statement the same day.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Romanians responded swiftly.&nbsp; A Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, in a written response to the <I>Straits Times</I> of 12th February 2010, stated that \"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania firmly dissociates itself from Mr Silviu Ionescu's statements made after his employment contract with the <p align=left>Column: 2196</p>Foreign Ministry was suspended.\"&nbsp; The spokesman was also reported in the media as dismissing the claim by Dr Ionescu that he had been \"set up\" as \"lurid allegations\" which \"do not even deserve to be commented upon as they are devoid of any substance\".&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The circumstances of the accidents understandably made many Singaporeans very angry with Dr Ionescu.&nbsp; And some have criticised the Singapore Government for not acting immediately to detain him.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I&nbsp;fully understand the outrage many Singaporeans feel over the hit-and-run accidents and the tragic death of Mr Tong.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;we should never do anything that is not in keeping with due legal process nor descend into trial by media.&nbsp; Otherwise, we will weaken our own case.&nbsp; When Dr Ionescu left Singapore in December 2009, the Police had not yet completed their investigations.&nbsp; In any case, we could not have prevented Dr Ionescu from leaving Singapore because as a diplomat accredited to Singapore, he enjoyed diplomatic immunity and could not be detained.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diplomats of all countries are accorded privileges and immunities under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to enable them to carry out their diplomatic functions.&nbsp; Romania and Singapore are parties to the Vienna Convention.&nbsp; Singapore is legally bound to give effect to the Convention.&nbsp; Even if we were not so bound, it is in Singapore's interest to observe the privileges and immunities accorded by the Vienna Convention because our own diplomats enjoy such privileges and immunities in foreign countries.&nbsp; But diplomatic immunity is not meant to be abused.&nbsp; MFA has zero tolerance for any abuse of diplomatic immunity by our own diplomats, even in such matters as parking fines.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman was also quoted in the <p align=left>Column: 2197</p>media as saying \"The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs firmly demands and expects its diplomats to respect&nbsp;&ndash; absolutely and with no equivocation&nbsp;&ndash; the national laws of the country to which they are accredited\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;means that the Romanian government, like the Singapore Government, takes the position that&nbsp;diplomatic immunity is not a licence to flout the law.&nbsp; And, indeed, as was pointed out in <I>Straits Times</I>,&nbsp;in December 2004, the Romanian government had faced a similar situation when one of its nationals was killed in a traffic accident by a US national with diplomatic immunity in Romania.&nbsp; That incident&nbsp;caused an uproar in Romania.&nbsp; We have left the Romanian government in no doubt about the&nbsp;depth of feelings in Singapore on this matter.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What we do next will depend on the outcome of our Coroner's Inquiry and the Romanian Government's response to our requests.&nbsp; We are closely monitoring what the Romanian authorities are doing.&nbsp; We expect their actions to match the words of the Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesman and the assurances that the Romanian Ambassador has given us. &nbsp;But I must stress that whatever we do in Singapore must always be in conformity with our own legal system and our international law obligations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Calvin Cheng (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

On the Coroner's Inquiry, the State Coroner has not issued a witness summons to Dr Ionescu as he is not in Singapore.&nbsp; The question of immunity from the witness summons therefore does not arise.&nbsp; MFA&nbsp;has instead sought the assistance of the Romanian Embassy to request Dr Ionescu to return to Singapore to attend the inquiry as an interested person.&nbsp; The State Coroner has&nbsp;the discretion to allow interested persons, ie, persons who have a legitimate interest in the death of the deceased, to take part in the Coroner's Inquiry such as by making a statement or by putting questions to the witnesses.&nbsp; We do not know whether Dr Ionescu will return to Singapore to attend the Inquiry and we cannot force him.&nbsp; The Inquiry will take place with or without Dr Ionescu presence.&nbsp; But as MFA pointed out to the Romanian Ambassador, if Dr Ionescu was not the driver, as he claimed, then it would be in his own interest to attend the inquiry to give his account of the events and pose questions to the witnesses.&nbsp; As to what happens after the Coroner's Inquiry, we have to take it one step at a time.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

According to Interpol Bucharest, in response to queries posted by our AGC, according to the Romanian Criminal Code, \"criminal law shall apply to offences committed outside Romanian borders if the perpetrator is a Romanian citizen.&nbsp; Interpol Bucharest added that the Romanian Court \"is conducting penal proceedings against&nbsp;Dr Ionescu&nbsp;for homicide&nbsp;by negligence, corporal injury by negligence, left&nbsp;from the scene of the accident and forged declarations\".&nbsp; So there is due process in Singapore, and there is due process in Romania.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, perhaps, let us take this one step&nbsp;at a time and not speculate because acting in haste or over-speculating&nbsp;

For every motorist who participates in the scheme, there is potentially one less car on our roads and expressways. &nbsp;This helps to reduce traffic demand and keep traffic on the roads smooth flowing. There is thus, merit to encourage more car owners to take up the Park&nbsp;and Ride scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scheme taps on existing car parks owned or operated by HDB, URA and SSC. The popular ones are usually situated at accessible locations or within the vicinity of MRT stations.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these car parks also serve the parking needs of residents, businesses and visitors. LTA has to work closely with the car park owners to balance the various needs.

Moving forward, LTA is adopting a multi-pronged approach to tackle this problem, by leveraging on innovative engineering solutions, providing other avenues to display advertisements and public education, in addition to regular maintenance and enforcement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In July last year, LTA conducted a trial on the use of anti-stick paint at the sheltered linkway leading to Jurong East MRT Station.&nbsp; LTA found that the columns painted with anti-stick paint remained free from illegal advertisements.&nbsp; Following the success of this trial, LTA started a pilot project to apply the anti-stick paint at three other locations, at Marine Parade, Geylang Road and Sims Avenue earlier this year.&nbsp; The anti-stick paint will progressively be applied at 16 hotspots <p align=left>Column: 2203</p>where the illegal posting of advertisements is rampant by early 2011.&nbsp; The annual cost of applying anti-stick paint at these 16 hotspots is around $70,000.&nbsp; In contrast, without the anti-stick paint, it would cost LTA $225,000 annually, or more than&nbsp;three times as much to maintain the cleanliness at these 16 hotspots.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA is also providing other spaces for people to put up notices and advertisements.&nbsp; As a trial, LTA will be providing and managing notice boards near transport nodes for low cost advertisements.&nbsp; By providing such facilities for the public to display their advertisements, LTA aims to discourage the indiscriminate posting of advertisements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to emphasise that everybody has a role to play, to exercise social responsibility in making sure that the public streets we all share remain clean.&nbsp; In the months to come, LTA will be embarking on public education initiatives to increase public awareness that the indiscriminate posting of advertisements is an offence.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Senior Parliamentary Secretary was telling us that there&nbsp;were 1091 offenders last year.&nbsp; A newspaper report also quoted that the composition fine is $300 for the first-offender to $400 for the second-time offender.&nbsp; May I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp; whether he is of the view that this composition fine is of sufficient deterrent to the advertisers?&nbsp; And may I also ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary&nbsp;rather than wasting money on non-stick paint, would LTA consider requiring offenders to remove their own advertisements some<p align=left>Column: 2204</p>what similar to the Corrective Work Order which was imposed for littering and failing which, a heavier penalty will be imposed on such offenders.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Ser Luck:</B> &nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;we believe that adopting a multi-pronged approach will tackle this problem, would actually be more effective.&nbsp; And I think as for enforcing the&nbsp;regulation against putting up these illegal advertisements, the entire process itself, may not seem to be cheaper.&nbsp; Because in enforcing the regulation, the LTA inspectors&nbsp;first have to take photographs of the daily advertisements on the public street facilities where they are found, and then possibly, have to call the number on the advertisement.&nbsp; And when they call the number advertised, the answering party may not co-operate.&nbsp;&nbsp;When that happens, subsequent follow-ups become more difficult to track down the offenders.&nbsp; When LTA issues the notice of offence, these offenders may also appeal for waiver of the composition fine and then these appeal cases will then have to be assessed on&nbsp;their own merits.&nbsp; So for the repeat offenders, LTA will also have to put up a report of offence before the notice of offence is issued to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire process is quite tedious, lengthy and costly in view of the man-hours needed but nevertheless we will still be&nbsp;putting&nbsp;enforcements and also at the same time&nbsp;provide public education.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anti-stick paint is another way and when it was piloted, it&nbsp;proved its effectiveness in that no illegal advertisements were put up.&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the multi-pronged approach will be more effective in this sense.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:EFFICIENCY GAINS FROM CREATION OF SINGHEALTH AND NATIONAL HEALTHCARE GROUPS--><p align=left>Column: 2204<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:EFFICIENCY GAINS FROM CREATION OF SINGHEALTH AND NATIONAL HEALTHCARE GROUPS:::2210--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Health (Mr Khaw Boon Wan)</B>:&nbsp; In 2000, MOH reorganised its restructured hospitals and polyclinics into two clusters.&nbsp; There were two objectives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Ministry of Health wanted to better integrate the hospitals and polyclinics to facilitate the referral of patients from polyclinics to hospitals and to coordinate the care of the patients with chronic diseases after their discharge from hospitals.&nbsp; There was also a desire for greater integration and coordination between hospitals and the national specialty centres.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Ministry of Health&nbsp;wanted the two clusters to compete more actively to provide better care at lower cost to their patients.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The clustering experience has generally been positive.&nbsp; The clusters compete in a friendly manner, to innovate and pilot new ideas, especially in the area of greater service integration, IT applications and chronic disease management.&nbsp; Some ideas were started by one cluster and when confirmed useful, were adopted by the other cluster.&nbsp; Patients gained along the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where appropriate, the clusters also collaborate and synergise for mutual benefits.&nbsp; For example, they combined their supply needs through bulk tenders and purchases, reaping substantial cost savings for our patients.&nbsp; Other areas of efficiency gains include:&nbsp;cost savings through sharing centralised services, such as laboratory and imaging services; and&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 2206</p>sharing best clinical practices, such as the protocols to reduce hospital acquired infections.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past three years, we have further reviewed the clustering experience and have progressively refined the healthcare delivery model to make it serve Singaporeans better.&nbsp; We have taken several significant steps, after factoring in our new insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, integration has to be more comprehensive, going beyond the public sector, to also include the private and charity sectors.&nbsp; This is particularly so for the care of the elderly with chronic diseases.&nbsp; These patients will during the course of their sickness consult many healthcare professionals from any or all of the three sectors, including GPs and nursing homes, besides restructured hospitals and polyclinics.&nbsp; The reason why we need to better integrate the care rendered by public hospitals and polyclinics applies similarly to the care rendered by the healthcare professionals from the private and charity sectors.&nbsp; This does not mean that we should nationalise all healthcare services, but it does require a stronger level of coordination and sharing of information across the entire range of healthcare service providers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, competition in healthcare has to be better understood and more skillfully managed in a way that is mindful of the</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Many economists have concluded that there is significant market failure in healthcare.&nbsp;Hence, \"real competition\" as observed by Mr Viswa Sadasivan in presumably other economic sectors, is not as prevalent as in the healthcare sector.&nbsp;One key obstacle to \"real competition\" is what economists refer to as \"information asymmetry\": the providers know much more than the consumers.&nbsp;But market does not inevitably fail in healthcare.&nbsp;If conditions conducive for competition exist, serious competition can take place.&nbsp;The generic <p align=left>Column: 2207</p>principles of healthy competition, including greater information transparency, can be applied to healthcare.&nbsp;So we need to discern what is applicable and implement those which are relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, competition in healthcare is less intense between large systems, but is more likely to occur at the micro level, between individual doctors or the hospital clinical departments.&nbsp;For example, when a pregnant woman is looking for an obstetrician, her decision is less about whether she would go to the SingHealth Cluster or the NHG Cluster.&nbsp;If she has decided to use the public sector, then she would more likely pick from among the Obstetrics Department of KK Hospital&nbsp;or NUH or SGH.&nbsp;And if she is familiar with the healthcare sector, she may even pick a particular doctor&nbsp;by name, never mind where the obstetrician operates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these insights, Ministry of Health has since brought the reorganisation further down the road. We have established regional clusters to build partnerships and seek synergies beyond the public healthcare sector.&nbsp;With an ageing population and increased prevalence of chronic diseases, we are strengthening community-based prevention, management and rehabilitation services, most of which are delivered by the private and charity sectors.&nbsp;There is a need for more proactive and coordinated joint management of patients by healthcare players from all the three sectors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These regional clusters will focus on providing integrated patient-centric care in partnership with other healthcare institutions within their respective geographical areas.&nbsp;For instance, the Changi General Hospital will anchor the eastern cluster, in partnership with St. Andrew&rsquo;s Community Hospital next door, GPs, polyclinics, nursing homes and other healthcare <p align=left>Column: 2208</p>providers in the east.&nbsp;We are doing the same in the other parts of Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthcare delivery will continue to evolve as medical science continues to make progress and better educated patients demand higher levels of service.&nbsp;We have restructured the public healthcare sector since the '80s and the enhancement in service level is visible to our patients.&nbsp;But it is not perfect and we will continue to improve it in the light of experience.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Viswa Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Viswa Sadasivan:</B> I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. It is very clear that in the area of service integration and sharing of resources that have been benefits. The question is really whether competition is indeed useful, necessary and in fact desirable in the healthcare sector. From what the Minister had said so far, there have been modifications to the existing practice by the Ministry of Health, which appears to be working on the ground, especially in the area of regionalising the clusters. The&nbsp;anecdotal feedback that we have been getting on the ground is that it is reaching out to the customers and consumers pretty well. Does this mean that in the next few years, we might be seeing a complete restructuring and perhaps an end to the existing two-cluster holdings?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> I thank the Member for his comment. Certainly, I believe competition is &ndash; to use his words&nbsp;&ndash; \"useful, necessary and desirable\". But as I explained in my reply, you have to be&nbsp;skilful in managing&nbsp;competition in this&nbsp;unique&nbsp;sector, called healthcare. Where the conditions are conducive, it can work and it works pretty well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My favourite example of demonstrating this is in the obstetrics service.&nbsp; Many friends who are obstetricians&nbsp;have always grumbled to me that for the last 15 years, their fees and the antenatal package <p align=left>Column: 2209</p>charges remain the same, in nominal terms. What it means in real terms is&nbsp;their income have been dropping because the productivity remains the same &ndash;&nbsp;how many&nbsp;babies can they deliver&nbsp;per&nbsp;day?&nbsp;This is the result&nbsp;of competition. I mentioned \"information asymmetry\" in healthcare, but in obstetrics, there is less asymmetry, because 90-odd percent of pregnancies will be routine pregnancies: simple deliveries, the mother stays&nbsp;two or three days, and mother and child go home happy. Pregnant ladies, after nine months of antenatal care in the clinics,&nbsp;have a lot of things to share. They know which doctors are charging what etc. There is information transparency. Here is a classic example of where the conditions for competition exist and competition will prevail. That is why obstetrics service has been pretty competitive. Likewise,&nbsp;look at our GP services. The reason why primary healthcare in Singapore is of good standard and is relatively inexpensive,&nbsp;is because it has been a pretty competitive market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may remember a few years ago that&nbsp;I did an experiment by just simply publishing the prices charged by ophthalmologists, when they do lasik operation. Just a simple act, and within two or three months, the prices of lasik packages dropped by more than a thousand dollars per eye.&nbsp;Lasik is a fairly homogenous product, though there are&nbsp;complications for some.&nbsp; With information transparency, you can achieve competition.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the bulk of&nbsp;healthcare services do not lend itself to such a competitive environment.&nbsp; But we have to continue to make progress, and therefore I look at this as a really long journey. We have started the first few steps, I think it has been positive, and we will continue to push it. Does it mean&nbsp;the end&nbsp;of the two clusters? Yes, in a way, it has ended.&nbsp;We now&nbsp;have&nbsp;a third cluster coming up in NUH. We have the fourth cluster coming up with Khoo Teck Puat Hospital near my Constituency. And I think that is a positive development.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)--><p align=left>Column: 2210</p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> &nbsp;Minister, I am still a little bit baffled by the logic.

As a major provider of tertiary healthcare services, Ministry of Health lends its support to the promotion of SingaporeMedicine. This is because increasingly foreign patients come here for sophisticated treatment in such tertiary care disciplines. This is an area which Singapore, despite&nbsp;our higher cost, has an edge over our regional competitors.&nbsp;While we have many competent specialists in the private sector, many are in the public sector.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade):</B> Just some clarifications and supplementary questions for the Minister. He mentioned that restructured hospitals do not take part in any overseas marketing. A friend of mine sent me a photograph of a billboard in a Russian city about coming to Singapore by&nbsp;a restructured hospital. I can send the Minister&nbsp;the picture which I must assume that is done by Singapore Tourism Board, if what Minister is saying is correct.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, I have these two supplementary questions. I wonder whether the retention of good doctors forms part of the reason for getting in these foreign private patients.&nbsp;I understand that possibly the doctors may be paid more <p align=left>Column: 2212</p>when they treat such patients. And if so, how does these incentives scheme affects their&nbsp;motivation to treat local patients? Second supplementary question is that there was recently a relaxation of Medisave to be allowed for in-patient use and treatment at overseas hospitals. I wonder whether is this a&nbsp;symptom or&nbsp; consequence of our resources being used to treat foreign patients at the expense of local patients. So I would like the Minister to comment on this.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> I look forward&nbsp;to receiving the poster or picture of a huge billboard, presumably by STB, under SingaporeMedicine. In recent years, we begin to get very interesting patients coming from very far away. Singapore has always been a regional medical hub. For 40 to&nbsp;50 years, we have had many patients from Indonesia and&nbsp;Malaysia.&nbsp;But in the last five years especially, we are getting patients from&nbsp;very far away, and Russia is one growing market, Middle East is another. I think that is good for Singapore, good for our economic development and it is part and parcel of the sophisticated development of our tourism business.&nbsp;This way,&nbsp;people come here for treatment and not merely to gamble.&nbsp;But&nbsp;as I&nbsp;said, I will take a look at the poster. The&nbsp;doctors charge foreign patients slightly more, in fact the hospitals also charge foreign patients slightly more. Because as you know, for our&nbsp;Class A rates, we are just charging Singaporeans at cost. I see no reason why foreigners should merely be charged at&nbsp;cost. Because&nbsp;the alternative for them is to&nbsp;go to the Parkway group or some other private hospitals, where there will be a profit margin. So we leave&nbsp;it to the hospitals&nbsp;to decide how much premium they want to&nbsp;levy. But&nbsp;I think the key point is still that&nbsp;at the end of the day,&nbsp;fewer than&nbsp;3% of our patients are foreigners. I do not think that is excessive. I mean if 30% of our patients&nbsp;or beds are occupied by foreigners,&nbsp;then obviously I&nbsp;got to sit down with the CEOs <p align=left>Column: 2213</p>to see what is happening, or is it we have so many empty beds that we are able to&nbsp;cope with this extra load.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;Medisave for overseas hospitals' use was my response to very strong suggestions from unionists. From the consumers' point of&nbsp;view, it is to stretch their Medisave dollars.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

If you want competition,&nbsp;this is another factor in helping to promote the competition advantages in this sector.&nbsp; By keeping our borders open, it keeps our operators within Singapore more competitive because if, say, they are losing a lot of patients to Johor Baru, then they will have to figure out a way&nbsp;to bring their costs down so that they can cling on to the patient load.&nbsp;

I would like to use the words which Minister Lim Swee Say likes to quote&nbsp;&ndash; if I am out of job, even if unemployment is 1.3%, it is 100% unemployment for the people affected.&nbsp; I think for that 3%,&nbsp;we need to look at it carefully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is about allowing Medisave to be used for treatment in hospitals outside of Singapore.&nbsp; Although that&nbsp;provides a choice, but we need to be assured that the quality aspects are not <p align=left>Column: 2214</p>compromised.&nbsp;

<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:&nbsp;</B> On the point of 3%,&nbsp;we have to look at the overall bed occupancy.&nbsp; Last month&nbsp;&ndash; because I was preparing the answer for another parliamentary question&nbsp;&ndash; our&nbsp;hospitals' actual bed occupancy rate averaged 82% or 84%.&nbsp; There is enough slack.&nbsp; If our occupancy is 97% or 98%, then at 3%, you are really crowding out the locals.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to look at it from that point of view.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, about ensuring quality&nbsp;&ndash; yes, certainly.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons why, since the unionists' suggestions, it took me more than a year to look at this problem, because if you just suddenly open the floodgate, there could be problems.&nbsp; But even then, I can never guarantee the quality of a particular service overseas.&nbsp; I cannot&nbsp;guarantee a particular quality of service even for hospitals in Singapore, say, a particular transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot guarantee it because there could be&nbsp;individual misconduct or negligence, or whatever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consumers as always, whether seeking treatment locally or across-border, have to think carefully before they decide to cross the border, particularly if they get into complications. &nbsp;And if they&nbsp;want to pursue legal suits, they will know that cross-border claims will be that much more difficult.&nbsp; That is why, although I have opened up this scheme, I personally do not expect many to go over.&nbsp; But even for the few who are able to take advantage of it, it is great savings for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;They can then preserve their Medisave dollars longer.&nbsp;

This is a 41% increase from the $51.1 million the Ministry spent on similar programmes in FY2008.&nbsp; For the first three quarters of FY2009 (April to December 2009), MCYS disbursed a total of $51.3 million on the various ComCare schemes.&nbsp; This is a 38% increase over the amount disbursed for the same period in FY2008.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2216</p>This increase in spending went towards assistance to help more needy families during the economic downturn.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From January to December 2009, almost 33,000 cases were approved for assistance under the&nbsp;three &nbsp;ComCare pillars: ComCare GROW, ComCare Self-Reliance and ComCare EnAble.&nbsp; This is a 47% increase from a year ago.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ComCare is targeted at the most needy, close to 48% of ComCare beneficiaries have household income less than $750 per month, and most have educational qualifications of \"O\" levels and below.&nbsp; About 60% are married with families.&nbsp; The beneficiaries helped under the different ComCare programmes have different profiles.&nbsp; Let me share with you a little more on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ComCare GROW programmes help young children from low-income families gain access to developmental opportunities and enable them to break out of the poverty cycle.&nbsp; Thirty-five per cent of ComCare expenditure for the first three quarters of FY2009 went to ComCare GROW programmes, with $18.1 million disbursed for the Kindergarten Financial Assistance Scheme (KiFAS), the Centre-based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare (CFAC), Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) and the Healthy Start Programme (HSP). The beneficiaries are families with children with a monthly household income of $1,800 and below.&nbsp; Close to 18,000 children from low-income families are being assisted on these programmes as at end December 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the ComCare Self-Reliance pillar, we have the Work Support Programme and ComCare Transitions scheme. Work Support aims to help those who need temporary financial and employment assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three thousand and seven hundred&nbsp;households were being assisted under Work Support as at end December 2009. The majority of our <p align=left>Column: 2217</p>Work Support beneficiaries are families (62%).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ComCare Transitions, on the other hand, aims to help those who are temporarily unable to work.&nbsp; As at end December 2009, 2,300 individuals were being assisted under the ComCare Transitions scheme.&nbsp; Most of these clients are single.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of ComCare Transitions and Work Support beneficiaries have educational qualifications of \"O\" levels and below (82%), live in 1-room to 3-room HDB flats (59%), and have household income of less than $600 per month (67%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between April and December 2009, up to $19 million has been disbursed for these two schemes.&nbsp; This figure amounts to 37% of overall ComCare spending.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at end December 2009, there are about 2,900 beneficiaries under the Public Assistance (PA) Scheme.&nbsp; Recipients on PA are generally the elderly, with a majority aged above 60 years old, with little or no means of support.&nbsp; A total of $10.9 million was spent on PA between April and December 2009.&nbsp; This is equivalent to 21% of all ComCare spending in the first three quarters of FY2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs continue to be the first line of support for needy residents. From January to December 2009, the CDCs received 62,300 applications for assistance, a 32% increase over 2008. Apart from specific programmes, the ComCare Fund also provides funds to empower the community to help the needy.&nbsp; The CCC ComCare Fund helps needy Singaporeans with urgent and transient needs.&nbsp; Between April and December 2009, the CCCs have disbursed $2.4 million through grassroots leaders to more than 12,600 needy people.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is 42% more than the <p align=left>Column: 2218</p>number of people helped in the same period in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ComCare Social Support Projects Fund (CSPF) and the ComCare Enterprise Fund (CEF) also provide seed funding for pilot programmes and sustainable new social enterprises respectively that meet the needs of the low-income and needy.&nbsp; Over $830,000 were disbursed between April and December 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides ComCare, there are other help schemes provided by voluntary welfare organisations, self-help groups, grassroots organisations, charities, religious groups&nbsp;and foundations.&nbsp; All these efforts complement the Government&rsquo;s assistance schemes under the Many Helping Hands approach to form a strong social safety net for needy Singaporeans.&nbsp; I would like to thank the CDC Mayors, Advisers to grassroots organisations and partner organisations in the social sector for their efforts and support.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Members come across anyone who needs assistance, please call ComCare Call at 1800-222 0000 or refer them to the CDCs, grassroots organisations or Family Service Centres.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to thank the Minister of State for a very comprehensive and detailed answer and, indeed, it is quite happy to hear that so much has been disbursed to assist Singaporeans because last year was truly a very difficult year for Singaporeans.&nbsp; We do not have much time.&nbsp; So I just ask one question,&nbsp; and that is, this year, although growth is projected to be between 4.5% and 6.5%, and there are more jobs created, families are still feeling from the aftermath effects of last year.

Our economy contracted by 2.0% in 2009. The damage was less than we had expected a year ago.&nbsp; However, this outcome did not reflect the severity of the economic crisis that hit countries worldwide.&nbsp; The world suffered its worst and most wide-spread recession in over 60 years. Global financial markets seized up in a way that has never happened before. Trade in goods and services also fell sharply, especially in Asia.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could not avoid this global contraction as a small economy which lives by exporting to Asia and the world. From the peak to the trough of this cycle, our GDP contracted by 10%.&nbsp;&nbsp;We took forceful measures to support our <p align=left>Column: 2221</p>economy. We brought in the Resilience Package aimed primarily at avoiding excessive job losses. The Jobs Credit and SPUR (Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience) helped companies limit retrenchments and retrain their workers; the Special Risk-sharing Initiative (SRI) supported bank lending, especially to SMEs; tax reductions helped companies with their cash flow and encouraged them to begin investing for recovery; and significant direct assistance helped Singaporean households to see through the crisis. The Government also took the unprecedented step of obtaining the President's approval to draw on past reserves to fund the Jobs Credit and the SRI scheme, so as to ensure that there was full confidence in our ability to intervene robustly, and to take further measures if necessitated by the crisis.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Resilience Package kept confidence up and helped Singapore avoid the worst of the global crisis. Taking both the recession and the recovery together, our economy has contracted less than most other highly globalised economies. Resident unemployment reached 5% in the third quarter of 2009, but has since fallen back to 3%. The labour market is once again tight, in many industries. We have avoided the 'jobless recovery' being experienced in several of the advanced economies. Further, outstanding bank loans to businesses have stabilised, with new loans in fact picking up significantly since November last year.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We weathered the crisis and emerged strongly both because of the effective Government response and the collective efforts of our people&ndash;our workers, unions and employers, our community organisations and voluntary groups, and all our citizens. We tackled this crisis together, the Singapore way.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br><I>Fiscal Position for FY2009</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because our economy contracted by less than expected last year, our budget <p align=left>Column: 2222</p>position has also turned out better than projected. The basic deficit (Operating Revenues minus Expenditures for FY2009) is now estimated at $8.5 billion compared to the $14.9 billion that was expected. So we ended up with a basic deficit at $8.5 billion, which is 3.3% of GDP.&nbsp; Our budget estimates in January last year reflected the grave uncertainties facing the world economy at the time and the expected sharp contraction in our own economy. The Government had forecasted a reduction of 2% to 5% in our GDP in 2009, which was also broadly similar to the market consensus forecasts at the time. The economy eventually showed negative growth of 2.0%, with better than expected performance of both employment and incomes&ndash;corporate incomes and personal incomes. Consequently, income tax revenues exceeded projections. Further, a strong recovery in the volume of transactions in the property market boosted stamp duty collections which ended up $1.3 billion higher than initially estimated.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The estimated basic deficit of $8.5 billion for FY2009 was nevertheless large, at 3.3% of GDP. Taking into account the Net Investment Return Contribution and the budgeted top-ups to endowment and trust funds, we now estimate a lower overall budget deficit of $2.9 billion (1.1% of GDP) for FY2009. This compares with the $8.7 billion overall deficit that was budgeted a year ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, the better-than-expected performance of the economy and the property market accounted for almost all of the improvement in our budget position. In essence, it reflected the return of confidence to our economy.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br><I>The decade ahead</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><I><B><br></B></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prospects for 2010 are good, although we have to be watchful for risks. The IMF projects world growth to swing from negative territory last year to 3.9% this <p align=left>Column: 2223</p>year.&nbsp; However, the path to recovery is unlikely to be smooth. The recent problems over sovereign debt in Greece could be contagious. Efforts by governments to reduce deficits so as to prevent unsustainable increases in debts, while necessary, will inhibit growth over the shorter term.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barring further major problems in global finance, we expect Singapore's growth to be around 4.5% to 6.5% in 2010. This is a strong expansion, but has to be seen against the contraction that we saw last year. This cyclical bounce in the economy does not reflect what we can sustain over the medium to long term.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, we should guard against over-exuberance in our property market. While the recovery in home prices over the last year reflects confidence in a recovering economy, we have to be vigilant to the risks of a property bubble forming. That is why in September last year, the Government took the first step, by eliminating housing loan schemes which defer principal payments to the future. Three days ago, we took a further pre-emptive step, imposing a seller stamp duty for residential properties that are sold within one year from the date of purchase, and lowering mortgage borrowing limits. These calibrated measures will discourage short-term speculation and reduce the risk of the property market overheating, which will inevitably hurt the economy.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br><I>Building capabilities to sustain our growth</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><I><br></I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to gear ourselves up to sustain growth over the next five to 10 years. As the Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) has identified, there will be no lack of opportunities for Singapore, especially with the rise of Asia and the emerging markets. Even the advanced economies, which are expected to grow <p align=left>Column: 2224</p>sluggishly, offer significant opportunities for Singapore-based companies to expand within niches of high-value, sophisticated demand.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our challenge is to capitalise on these opportunities and grow our economy even with the slower growth of our workforce. The ESC, drawing on views from the public and private sectors, unions and academia, has set out its recommendations on how we should transform our economy to achieve this. We have to chart a new course for growth: based on skills, innovation and productivity. We must also pursue initiatives to make Singapore a vibrant and distinctive city, and a home that provides an outstanding quality of life for our people.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has accepted the key thrusts of the ESC report. Budget 2010 sets out the main actions the Government will take to help Singapore succeed in these new directions. During the Committee of Supply (COS) Debate, Ministries will set out their responses on several other issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further programmes and initiatives will be rolled out over the next one to two years to implement the recommendations of the ESC.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br><B>TOWARDS AN ADVANCED ECONOMY: SUPERIOR SKILLS, QUALITY JOBS, HIGHER INCOMES</B></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><B><br></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budget 2010 therefore looks beyond the immediate rebound in the economy. It focuses on building up the capabilities we need for a phase shift in our economy over the next decade, with growth being based on the quality of our efforts rather than the over-expanding use of manpower and other resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our key goal is to grow our productivity by 2% to 3% per year over the next decade, more than double the 1% we achieved over the last decade.&nbsp; Raising skills and productivity is the only viable way we can achieve higher wages, <p align=left>Column: 2225</p>and it is the best way to help citizens with low incomes. If we achieve this goal, we can raise real incomes by one-third in 10 years.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will also allow us to maintain a healthy rate of economic growth of 3% to 5% a year, even with slower growth of our work force.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will commit its resources and energies to support this major uplift in productivity. But this has to be a comprehensive national effort, with everyone pitching in and taking ownership. That is the only way we can attain superior skills in every vocation and at every level, shift enterprises to higher-value activities, and create quality jobs for all our people. It is how we will make Singapore an advanced economy.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><I>A major investment for the future</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><I><br></I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2010 will provide a major investment for this future.&nbsp; First, the Government will launch a sustained initiative to help enterprises and workers raise productivity &ndash; by deepening skills and expertise, and innovating to create more value. This initiative will cost the Government $5.5 billion over the next five years alone.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will further support the growth of more globally competitive Singapore companies. We will help companies which are seeking to commercialise R&amp;D, and those which are expanding abroad. The next five to 10 years offer a window of opportunity for Singapore firms to establish themselves in markets abroad, while their skill-sets are in high demand. By supporting the internationalisation of these companies, we can also grow and sustain high-value activities in Singapore and create more good jobs, in both manufacturing and service vocations.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\" align=\"left\"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we will help include everyone in growth. We will continue to build a <p align=left>Column: 2226</p>society where everyone has the best opportunity to reach further and stretch their potential, and every family can progress and enjoy a better quality of life. The Budget will provide further support for our low-wage workers to upgrade themselves, and more help for families with children and for older Singaporeans. We will also restructure our property tax system to benefit the majority of home owners.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>RAISING PRODUCTIVITY: SKILLS, INNOVATION AND ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Our basic approach</I></p><p><I><B><br></B></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Achieving 2% to 3% productivity growth per year for a whole decade will be a major challenge. While we achieved 5% productivity growth in the 1980s, and about 3% in the 1990s, we were starting from a lower level then. In 1980, we were only 20% as productive as the countries that were global leaders. We had great scope to catch up by importing existing technologies, automating low-value manual activities in factories, and evolving from a workforce where few workers had completed a post-secondary education to one in which most younger people do.&nbsp; Today, levels of productivity in our larger sectors are about 60% that of the leaders. The scope to improve is clearly there, but the easy gains in productivity are over.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making the next leap in productivity will require a multi-faceted effort.&nbsp; It will involve transformations at three levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have to restructure our overall economy towards higher-value activities and exit from less efficient ones. This broad economic restructuring is how major improvements in productivity have been achieved in many of the advanced economies. But the Government cannot decide which enterprises should succeed or phase out, or say exactly what the corporate landscape should look like 10 years from now. We must rely on the <p align=left>Column: 2227</p>market to achieve this restructuring. 3% to 5% GDP growth per year does not mean every industry or business growing by 3% to 5%. More competitive and innovative players must be allowed to grow much faster, by bidding for the talent, manpower, land and other resources that they need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second level of productivity improvement will come from upgrading individual industries and enterprises. The Budget will extend strong support for them to do so, in every sector.&nbsp; We will give significant tax benefits to businesses that invest in skills and innovation, thereby lowering their effective tax rates. We will also provide grants for customised, industry-based initiatives. Indeed, in industries like construction, individual firms can only improve if the industry as a whole upgrades its norms and practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third level of productivity improvement comes from raising the skills and creative potential of every worker. We will progressively build up a first-class system for Continuing Education and Training (CET) over the next decade. This will be a major investment in our people,&nbsp;up and down the skills&nbsp;ladder. However, we can only make our next leap in productivity and incomes if every individual takes the initiative to develop his skills and expertise, and accomplish more in his job and career. Our employers must also empower their people to find new ways to add value, and help unlock every worker's potential. The best companies already do this; we must spread this enabling culture across all businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Achieving our goal of 2% to 3% productivity growth per year, for a leap of one-third over the next 10 years, will therefore require everyone to play their <p align=left>Column: 2228</p>part &ndash; businesses and industry associations, workers and unions and the Government&ndash;and work closely together. The Government will commit $1.1 billion a year over the next five years in the form of tax benefits, grants and training subsidies to support this combined, national effort to raise productivity.</p><p><br><I>Managing our dependence on foreign workers</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To complement investments in productivity, we must also manage the supply of foreign workers. If we make low cost foreign workers too readily available, employers will not have sufficient incentive to upgrade their operations and upskill their workers. But if we cut back too sharply on the supply of foreign workers, then despite companies' best efforts to raise productivity, they may not be able to compete with other Asian players, and in many industries they will not find enough local workers to grow.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reducing our dependence on foreign workers will pay off in higher productivity over the long term, but there are real trade-offs in growth and incomes over the shorter term. We must therefore move forward in a balanced manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>How we grew incomes in the last decade</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed we faced similar trade-offs in the past decade. Much of our growth in the&nbsp; last 10 years took place from 2004 to 2007, when our GDP grew an average of 8% per year.&nbsp; We were able to achieve this because companies could obtain the workers they needed to seize opportunities to expand while the environment was favourable. Foreign labour also allowed the construction sector to grow quickly, and eased supply bottlenecks in the property sector.&nbsp; Our workforce grew rapidly over those four years, by 5% per year, with foreigners accounting for about half of the growth.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2229</p>By going for growth when the conditions allowed, we offset the downturns we experienced earlier in the decade &ndash; first, when the global dot-com bubble burst in 2000, then with 9/11, and again when SARS hit us in 2003. The upshot is that by allowing in foreign workers so that we could go for growth in the good years, we reduced unemployment, and raised wages for Singaporeans after the standstill in the first part of the decade. As Chart 1* shows, it enabled the median income per household member(1) to rise significantly from 2005 to 2008 &ndash; in fact contributing virtually all income growth that occurred in the past decade.&nbsp; (Median income over the decade grew by 20%, adjusted for inflation, and virtually all of it happened during that four-year period.) This was therefore not a strategy of&nbsp;\"growth at all costs\",&nbsp; but of growing our economy to raise Singaporean incomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Complementing productivity incentives with higher foreign worker levies&nbsp;</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now need to take calibrated steps to manage our dependence on foreign workers. They already comprise almost a third of the total workforce, and there are social and physical limits to how many more we can absorb. As the ESC recommended, we should moderate the growth of the foreign workforce, and avoid a continuous increase in its proportion to the total workforce.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to do this is through the price mechanism, that is, by raising foreign worker levies rather than by imposing numerical limits. This allows the foreign workforce to fluctuate across the economic cycle, and also enables employers who are doing well and need more foreign workers to continue to hire them rather than be constrained by fixed quotas. We will phase in higher levies gradually over the next three years, so that companies know well in advance what will happen and have time to adjust.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2230</p>The increase in levies will be complemented by the strong financial support from the Government, through tax benefits and grants to help businesses that invest to raise their employees' skills, to improve efficiency or to create more value.&nbsp; In fact, over the next five years, the government financial support that the business sector will receive for productivity upgrading will be significantly larger than the additional payment they have to make in foreign worker levies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will therefore be our basic approach. The Government will provide enterprises and workers with full support to upskill, innovate and develop the capabilities to create more value with the same amount of work. We will facilitate economic restructuring to help dynamic and entrepreneurial players to grow faster. And we will complement this by raising the cost of employing foreign workers, especially those with lower skills, so as to incentivise companies to increase productivity.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our efforts, taken together, with everyone playing their part, will transform Singapore into an advanced economy: with superior skills, quality jobs and higher incomes for our people.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now elaborate on each of our main initiatives to boost skills, innovation and economic restructuring.</p><p><br><I>National Productivity and Continuing Education Council</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we will establish a high-level National Productivity and Continuing Education Council.&nbsp; The Council will include members from the Government, business community and labour movement.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean will chair this Council. It will galvanise the major national effort required to boost skills and enterprise productivity, and develop a comprehensive system for <p align=left>Column: 2231</p>continuing education and training.&nbsp; The Council will oversee the work of the different Government agencies and promote close collaboration amongst the business sector, workers and unions, and the public sector.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More details on the composition of the Council and how it will approach its work will be announced later by Deputy Prime Minister Teo.</p><p><br><I>Investing in continuing education</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Continuing Education and Training (CET) will be our next major wave of investment in our people.&nbsp; We will build up an outstanding CET system for adults, to complement a first-rate education system for our young. In total, we will spend $2.5 billion over the next five years on CET.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans' adaptability has always been one of our key strengths. That is how we have progressed from one phase of development to another since the sixties. Even without much formal education, our workers have been able to adapt to new needs on the job. However, the next phase of gains in productivity will require us to develop competence in more complex tasks, mastery of skills and depth of expertise in every trade and profession. It will require both a comprehensive and customised approach, including the development of centres of excellence that are focused on specific industries and clusters of enterprises.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also develop a continuous ladder of skills and qualifications that anyone can acquire at different stages in their lives. We will continue to strengthen links between the Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) and what individuals acquire through the post-secondary and tertiary education system, so that workers can build on skills obtained through either pathway.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2232</p>This need for a comprehensive CET system becomes more important as our workforce gets older. The Government will help employers to invest in their workers, so they can keep building on their knowhow and maximise their value in the workplace.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>An additional boost for older, low-wage workers</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will place additional emphasis on our older, low-wage workers, by providing them the needed support to enhance their skills and continue to be valued in the workplace.&nbsp;Currently, we have the Workfare Income Supplement, or WIS, to encourage older low-wage workers to stay in the workforce. We will undertake two further enhancements to help this group, following the recommendations of the ESC.</p><p><br><I>Introduction of Workfare Training Scheme (WTS)</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will give further incentive for employers and low-wage workers to commit to training.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will introduce a three-year Workfare Training Scheme or WTS to complement the WIS. It will be aimed at helping older workers, but will also be open to younger WIS recipients (aged 35 years and above).&nbsp; In other words, it will be open to all recipients under the WIS. The WTS will help them overcome barriers to training and capitalise on opportunities to advance through the CET system.&nbsp; The WTS will firstly provide their employers with 90% to 95% of funding for absentee payroll and course fee outlays. Secondly, to recognise the efforts of the workers who go for this skills upgrading, we will provide them with cash grants when they complete their training. The grants will be capped at $400 per year. WTS will also include a structured training programme for those with very low skills, including those who may be out of a job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2233</p><p><I>Enhancement of Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the first initiative, to help older, low-wage workers. Next, we will enhance the WIS itself. Starting from 2010, maximum payouts for the WIS will be increased by between $150 and $400 (2), with more going to older workers to encourage them to remain in the workforce. For example, a 60-year-old worker will get an annual WIS payment of up to $2,800, an increase of $400, up from $2,400 currently. We have also decided to extend WIS to workers earning up to $1,700 a month &ndash; up from the current limit of $1,500. This will ensure that as low-wage workers upgrade their skills and begin to earn more, their WIS benefits do not decrease too quickly.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enhanced WIS will cost an additional $100 million annually and will benefit about 400,000 low-wage workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further details of the enhancements to Workfare (WIS and WTS) will be announced by the Minister for Manpower in his Committee of Supply speech.</p><p><br><I>Supporting Enterprise Investments in Innovation and Productivity</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our second major area of investment is aimed at catalysing improvements in enterprises themselves. We will support businesses that are re-engineering their work processes and re-designing jobs so as to help their employees create more value. Equally important, we will support their efforts to innovate &ndash; to gain competitiveness, come up with new products and services and generate additional revenue streams.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will provide tax incentives for businesses in all sectors to invest in upgrading their operations and creating new value.&nbsp; We will also extend substantial grants to specific industries, clusters and even enterprises. These <p align=left>Column: 2234</p>grants will be of greatest benefit to the SME sector. In fact, both the tax incentives and grants would be of greatest benefit to the SME sector.</p><p><br><I>Productivity and Innovation Credit</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> First, we will introduce a 'Productivity and Innovation Credit'.&nbsp; The Credit will provide significant tax deductions, for investments in a broad range of activities along the innovation value chain. Specifically, it would cover spending on the following activities within this innovation value chain:<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research &amp; Development;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration of intellectual property &ndash; including patents, trademarks, and designs;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acquisition of intellectual property &ndash; for example, when a company buys a patent or copyright for use in its business;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design activities;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Automation through technology or software; and finally</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Training of employees.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, these are six activities which will be covered under the Productivity and Innovation Credit. All businesses will be eligible for the Credit, based on the amount they invest in any of the activities covered by the Credit. They can deduct 250% of their expenditures on each of these activities from their taxable income. I have capped the enhanced tax deductions at $300,000 of expenditures for each activity so as to focus the benefits on SMEs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be helpful to illustrate this. For example, if a company spends $300,000 on automation, it can deduct not just the <p align=left>Column: 2235</p>usual 100% of the expenditure under normal tax rules, but an additional 150% under the scheme. This works out to an additional $450,000 of deductions, which will give the company tax savings of about $76,500. If the company also spends $150,000 to design a new product, it will save a further $38,300. As Members can see, the company will then enjoy total tax savings from investing in the two activities, of $114,800 on an investment of $450,000 (3).&nbsp; In other words, the company gets back a quarter of its investment through additional tax benefits from the Government. The company can undertake any number of activities under the scheme in a year.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Productivity and Innovation Credit is a major enhancement to what businesses can currently receive. Currently, only R&amp;D qualifies for higher tax deductions, of up to 150% of expenditures. The new Credit will spur a much broader range of innovative activities as well as provide an unprecedented level of tax deductions, at 250% of expenditures on each activity.&nbsp; Further, businesses who are investing in the training of their employees can enjoy the tax benefits under the Credit on top of the various WDA subsidies &ndash; including the new WTS that I just spoke about.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Productivity and Innovation Credit will be available for five years, Years of Assessment 2011 to 2015.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support small but growing businesses which are cash-constrained, I will also allow businesses the option to convert up to $300,000 of their Productivity and Innovation Credit a year into a cash grant of up to $21,000 (4).&nbsp; This will help businesses that are starting off with low taxable income, but want to grow by investing in technology or upgrading their operations.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Businesses in all sectors can take advantage of this scheme not just <p align=left>Column: 2236</p>manufacturing enterprises that are investing in machinery. For example, a Japanese food outlet at Iluma Mall called Ebisboshi Shotengai invested $160,000 to implement a wireless self-ordering system &ndash; apparently the latest technology from Japan, which allows customers to simply tap on the menu using a wireless stylus pen, to send their orders to both the kitchen and the cashier's desk. It is a \"talking\" pen which repeats customers' orders aloud. In the future, it could give some advice as well on what to order. [<I>Laughter from hon. Members</I> ]. Not only has it reduced customers' waiting time, it has translated into faster turnover. The restaurant has also been able to employ only two-thirds the number of staff it would normally have required, and expects to fully recover its investment in the self-ordering system in two years. If we apply our scheme to a case like this, not only is it in the enterprise's interest to invest as it will recover its investments within a period of years &ndash; in this case, two years &ndash; but it would also get from the Government a tax credit that provides them tax savings upfront.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Productivity and Innovation Credit scheme will cost us $480 million a year.</p><p><br><I>National Productivity Fund</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> We will complement this broad-based tax reduction for all companies which invest in innovation, with funding for initiatives customised to specific industries, clusters, and enterprises.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this second pillar of support for enterprise productivity, we will create a National Productivity Fund. We target to put $2 billion into this new Fund. To start, we will inject $1 billion into the Fund in 2010, which we expect to be able to support initiatives over the next&nbsp;five years. This is a major commitment. In setting aside funds now, we make clear the Government's long-term support for <p align=left>Column: 2237</p>productivity improvements, irrespective of the state of the economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Productivity and Continuing Education Council will establish the priorities and programmes of this new Fund, and tie together the efforts of all stakeholders &ndash; Government agencies, industry associations, unions and enterprises.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The National Productivity Fund will provide grants to help enterprises in all sectors, with special emphasis initially on sectors where there is potential for large gains in productivity. The Fund can also be used to develop centres of expertise for a range of industries, which will grow a knowledge base for enterprises to tap on to develop productivity solutions.</p><p><br><I>Construction sector initiatives</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Construction is a key sector which needs to improve.&nbsp; Its productivity levels are estimated to be about half of that in Australia and one-third of that in Japan. Around $250 million out of the first $1 billion of funding for the National Productivity Fund will be dedicated to raising productivity in the construction sector. This will include initiatives to help our local contractors develop capabilities in areas such as complex civil engineering and building projects,&nbsp; to invest in new technologies, and upgrade to a higher quality workforce. The Minister for National Development will announce more details during the Committee of Supply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Pervasive innovation</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our challenge is to make innovation and productivity improvements second nature to both companies and employees, and in every sector. Some Singapore companies have already gained strong competitive advantage by doing so. Keppel Offshore &amp; Marine, for example, has made major changes to how oil rigs are constructed by using new manufactur<p align=left>Column: 2238</p>ing concepts, detailed production planning and, most importantly, by sharing the responsibility for innovation and continual improvements with employees, with everyone taking responsibility.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Productivity is now a way of life across the yard &ndash; from crane signalmen using air pressure in a \"Miracle Trolley\" to lift heavy weights and halve the number of man-hours required; to machinists applying new methods to minimise vibration and hence double productivity; to electricians using an in-house innovation comprising Teflon rollers to ease the task of laying cables within restricted spaces; to pipefitters using another in-house innovation to shorten the time they need to dispense pipes by 40%. None of this is rocket science, but it means improvements year after year and in a record year like Keppel O&amp;M had in 2009, a productivity bonus of nine months across the board.</p><p><br><I>Raising foreign worker levies</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, raising foreign worker levies. We will complement our support for enterprise innovation and upgrading by raising foreign worker levies. The increase will be calibrated and carefully phased in, so as to give companies a clear incentive to upgrade while providing them time to develop plans to re-gear and grow through productivity improvements.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will gradually raise the foreign worker levies, and tighten the levy tiers that are based on the proportion of foreign workers in a company's workforce. The changes will start with a modest increase in levies in 2010, and will involve further increases over the next two years. The overall dependency ratio for all categories of foreign workers (Work Permit as well as S Pass holders) will remain unchanged.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a first step, levy rates will be raised by between $10 and $30 for most Work Permit holders on 1st July 2010.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2239</p>We will phase in further adjustments in levy rates and dependency tiers in 2011 and 2012. Taking the three years together, there will be a total increase of about $100 in average levies per worker in manufacturing and services. So, a $100 increase on average, reflecting the effect of both levy rate increases as well as the tightening of dependency tiers. The construction sector, where there is much scope for productivity improvements, will see a larger increase, ie, larger than $100.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also make changes for S Pass workers. There will now be two levy tiers. Currently, there is just a single-tier of $50. The rates for the first and second tiers will be $100 and $120 in July 2010, up from a single rate of $50 currently. Further adjustments will then be phased in until the rates reach $150 and $250 for the two tiers by July 2012.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM and MND will release more details of the changes to the Foreign Worker Levy later this week.<br>The changes in foreign worker levies will provide clear incentives for businesses to restructure and upgrade their operations so as to rely less on lower skilled foreign workers. Businesses will receive significant financial support from the Government to do so through the schemes I highlighted earlier &ndash; the Productivity and Innovation Credit, the National Productivity Fund and training subsidies. These schemes will help them to invest in productivity and to develop higher-skilled workers, especially Singaporeans. Their investments can be in many forms &ndash; automating processes, training their employees, using pre-fabrication in construction or spending on design to create higher value &ndash; but the resulting productivity gains will benefit both businesses and workers.</p><p><br><I>Supporting business restructuring<br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our final strategy for achieving higher productivity is to support the progressive <p align=left>Column: 2240</p>restructuring of our overall economy, towards higher-value and more innovative players. This is as important as the upgrading within each industry or enterprise which is also what we will promote.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must encourage a continuous flow of start-ups and new entrants into the economy, and allow the most efficient and competitive players the room to grow and scale up, either through organic growth or through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). The less competitive businesses, large or small, have to be encouraged to upgrade themselves.&nbsp; Those unable to do so will over time lose out in the marketplace.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This restructuring is especially important in creating a dynamic and viable SME sector.&nbsp; More SMEs are now developing capabilities for innovation, and creating a competitive edge for themselves. We must help them grow, and acquire the scale required to attract talent, invest in technologies and compete effectively in overseas markets.</p><p><br><I>Facilitating economic restructuring through M&amp;A</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The economic recovery &ndash; both locally and abroad &ndash; provides a window of opportunity for growth through acquisitions. We will facilitate mergers and acquisitions, but companies must decide for themselves whether it makes more business sense to grow organically or through M&amp;A.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year I introduced the corporate amalgamation framework. Under this tax framework, the tax benefits of the amalgamating companies can be transferred to the amalgamated entity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, we will take a further step. M&amp;A can be a costly and resource intensive process, particularly for <p align=left>Column: 2241</p>acquiring companies which are not large players. I will therefore introduce, for five years, a one-off tax allowance scheme to help defray a portion of acquisition costs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The allowance will be equal to 5% of the value of the acquisition. The acquisition of a $50 million company, for example, will give the acquiring company a tax allowance of $2.5 million. It will be able to deduct $2.5 million against its taxable income over five years, resulting in total tax savings of $425,000(5).&nbsp; I will cap the allowance granted at $5 million in a single Year of Assessment(6). This is to focus on helping the SME sector develop vibrance and dynamism.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new allowance is designed for simplicity. Previously, interest expenses incurred in acquisitions could be deducted against taxable dividend income. This is no longer possible, as dividend income is no longer taxable. The new allowance will help the acquiring firm offset part of its costs, but without seeking to distinguish between interest costs and other costs. It is therefore neutral between debt and equity in financing transactions.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a further measure to reduce the cost of M&amp;A, I will also waive stamp duty on the transfer of unlisted shares for such deals. This will apply to such deals worth up to $100 million in any one year. Listed shares are already exempt from stamp duty currently. This one-off concession for unlisted shares will also be available for five years.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two incentives together will cost about $100 million a year.</p><p><br><I>Enhancing land productivity</I></p><p><I><B><br></B></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides raising labour productivity, we have to move progressively to make better use of land, given the limits to how much additional land we can reclaim. As the ESC has recommended, we should promote the intensification of industrial <p align=left>Column: 2242</p>land use, towards more land-efficient and higher value-added activities.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Industrial Building Allowance (IBA) was introduced in 1940s to encourage industrialisation. The IBA has met its objective but is no longer adequate or relevant to meet our current priorities. It does not distinguish between efficient and inefficient uses of land. I will therefore phase out the IBA. Existing IBA claimants can continue to claim their remaining IBA on qualifying buildings until their allowances are written down.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will however introduce a more targeted scheme to support enhanced land productivity among industrial users. The new Land Intensification Allowance or LIA will apply to nine sectors which have been identified as those with large land take (the details are at Annex 1*). It will give businesses in these sectors tax allowances on their building costs if they meet or exceed the Gross Plot Ratio (GPR) benchmarks set for each sector. To encourage land intensification, these benchmarks will be set at around the 75th percentile of actual GPRs for each of these sectors. Businesses that meet this benchmark will receive more generous allowances than are currently offered under the IBA (7).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>GROWING GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE COMPANIES</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Internationalisation &ndash; A growth imperative</I></p><p><B><I><br></I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, growing globally competitive companies. In order to reorient our economy towards higher value-added activities, we must support rapidly growing companies. More Singapore companies are emerging with significant competitive strengths of their own and are now expanding into international markets.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even our SMEs are internationalising. Amongst our top 500 SMEs, overseas revenues have grown by 60% over the last two years, and they now account for 57% of their total revenues.</p><p align=left>Column: 2243</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A major part of global growth in the next decade will come from emerging markets, and especially Asia. Rapid urbanisation and an increasing demand for higher-value services will give Singapore companies opportunities to expand in these markets &ndash; in sectors like clean energy, waste and water management, healthcare, education and transport management. However, given the intensifying competition from companies both in Asia and around the world, we must move decisively in the next decade to establish significant presence in these high-growth markets.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The G3 markets &ndash; US, Europe and Japan &ndash; will also remain major sources of demand for Singapore companies. As a relatively small player, we still have significant growth potential even if the overall growth of these advanced markets is constrained.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the furniture industry. Last month, at the Cologne furniture fair, Singapore furniture companies secured spot sales of $14 million and, potentially, some $230 million worth of follow-up sales. Likewise in the services sector, CSE Global, a home-grown IT systems integrator, earns about 70% of its revenues from the advanced economies. In 2006, for example, it won a bid to develop a fully-integrated and paperless healthcare records system for the UK National Health Service, serving 50,000 clinicians and support staff.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is therefore a world of opportunities for our companies &ndash; in Asia and the emerging markets, as well as in the G3 economies. SPRING, IE Singapore and EDB are providing them with valuable support, in areas such as capability development, internationalisation and financing. We will further boost our efforts to help local players grow into globally-competitive companies. These <p align=left>Column: 2244</p>efforts will comprise three major thrusts, which I will elaborate on in turn.<br></p><p></p><p></p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\"><p>*Cols. 2297-2298.<br>(1) Data refers to non-retiree Singaporean households.

We must build and maximise the synergies amongst companies in Singapore, both local and foreign. The MNCs, as well as smaller global enterprises, are growing their base in Singapore and expanding out from here into Asia. They are valuable potential partners to our local firms, helping them to plug into world markets and thereby scale up their operations, while collaborating with them to develop new, cutting-edge competencies.</p><p><br><I>Partnerships for Capability Transformation (PACT)</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EDB operates the Local Industry Upgrading Programme (LIUP) to strengthen procurement linkages between MNCs and local companies. It has worked well, encouraging more than 200 MNCs to procure from over 1,000 local suppliers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will now build on this collaborative approach by focusing not only on procurement, but also on the development of new capabilities for our local enterprises. This will include helping local companies develop the competencies needed to meet stringent manufacturing quality and certification requirements. This will be under a new programme called Partnerships for Capability Transformation, or PACT for short, which will subsume the existing Local Industries Upgrading Programme. We are setting aside $250 million over five years to defray part of the qualifying expenses for such partnerships.</p><p><br><I>Business associations as growth champions</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, our business associations, including both our trade associations and <p align=left>Column: 2245</p>chambers of commerce, can be powerful change agents in strengthening capabilities and internationalisation. The furniture industry example I gave earlier illustrates how businesses banding together can reinvent even our traditional sectors. The Singapore Furniture Industries Council has run more than 120 courses over the last six years. They also created a brand for the furniture cluster &ndash; Singapore Mozaic &ndash; which is now earning recognition in the global marketplace. In fact, some of our local furniture companies use that cluster brand, Singapore Mozaic, rather than their own brands, when they market in some overseas markets.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SPRING and IE Singapore work closely with business associations through several initiatives such as the Local Enterprise and Association Development programme, LEAD for short, and the Enterprise Development Centres (EDCs). We will commit $100 million over five years to scale up our support for business associations to drive productivity at the industry level, and to facilitate international market access for the members.</p><p><br><I>Nurturing future business leaders</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we have to nurture the next generation of business leaders. Our universities and polytechnics are putting more effort into exposing their students to industry. More than half of their students now go on at least one industry attachment by the time they graduate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a generation of SME leaders who have built up successful businesses from scratch. Ensuring that these SMEs have a continued pipeline of talent is therefore a critical priority, so as to grow the value that is embedded in these firms.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government cannot direct leadership succession in SMEs, but we can help support the flow of talent to SMEs. We will commit $45 million over five years to enhance SPRING&rsquo;s Business Leaders Initiative. This is an umbrella <p align=left>Column: 2246</p>programme to attract young talent into SMEs, and groom a future generation of SME managers and entrepreneurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br><I><B>Reaping commercial advantage from R&amp;D<br></B></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Gaining dividends from our R&amp;D investments</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R&amp;D. Over the last 10 years, we have transformed Singapore's R&amp;D landscape. A vibrant ecosystem is emerging, comprising a diverse range of research facilities, both in the private and public sectors.&nbsp; In the next decade, we must build on our initial investments, especially by expanding private sector R&amp;D, and move decisively to commercialise R&amp;D so as to maximise returns from these investments.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finland illustrates how a sustained R&amp;D policy can move a small economy to the innovation forefront. In the early 1990s, Finland's gross expenditure on R&amp;D stood at 2% of GDP which was at that time below the OECD average. In the mid-1990s, the Finnish government dramatically increased funding for research and scientific education to bring their gross R&amp;D investments to 3.4% of GDP by the end of that decade. Now, 20 years later and with close public-private collaboration, Finland has created an innovation economy that consistently tops the ranks in global indicators of scientific productivity and new-to-market product innovations.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Singapore, our Gross Expenditure on R&amp;D stood at 1.9% of GDP in 1990 and has grown to 2.8% in 2008, on track to achieving 3.0% this year. The ESC has recommended that we raise this further to 3.5% of GDP over the next five years, and that it be achieved through increased private sector R&amp;D expenditure.</p><p><br><I>Sustain commitment to public sector R&amp;D</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government agrees with this target. First, we will sustain our commitment to public sector basic- and <p align=left>Column: 2247</p>mission-oriented research at 1% of GDP. We have thus far provided $2.2 billion to the National Research Fund. We will add substantially to this amount by putting another $1.5 billion into the Fund this year to support this continuous commitment to R&amp;D.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to maximise the linkages between public and private sector R&amp;D. Closer interaction between corporate labs and research centres can support commercial innovation across a diverse range of industries, from clean energy to digital media. We have already started this process. One example is A*STAR's aerospace consortium with 18 companies, comprising local SMEs as well as world-class aviation players. At the recent Singapore Airshow, the consortium showcased cutting-edge technologies co-developed by A*STAR research institutes and industry experts.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talent flow from the public sector research institutes to private corporate labs is part of the synergy that these linkages can create. In the last three years, 650 research engineers and scientists have moved out of the public sector to private corporate labs, including 100 seconded to local enterprises, as part of a joint SPRING-A*STAR initiative to upgrade enterprises' technological capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we will maintain public sector support for R&amp;D at 1% of GDP, we should grow private sector R&amp;D from 2% of GDP currently to 2.5% over the next five years.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new Productivity and Innovation Credit scheme that I described earlier will provide significant incentive for companies to invest in R&amp;D. It will provide a tax deduction of 250% on the first $300,000 of R&amp;D investments, and 150% on the remaining R&amp;D costs. <p align=left>Column: 2248</p>Together with the innovation vouchers that SPRING provides to SMEs, and the potential partnerships that companies can form with public sector research institutes, Singapore will be one of the most compelling locations in Asia for private sector R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also be one of the most conducive locations in which companies, local and foreign, can commercialise R&amp;D &ndash; translating ideas and inventions from anywhere in the world into prototypes and commercially-viable products and marketing them anywhere in the world.</p><p><br><I>Public-Private Co-Innovation Partnership</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government, as a significant consumer of products and services, can itself play a larger role to help innovation-driven companies turn their R&amp;D into marketable solutions.&nbsp; This has taken place on an ad-hoc basis in the past.&nbsp; We will now do it proactively and systematically. We need many more examples like Hyflux, whose engagement with PUB opened up for the firm the ability to develop new capabilities and a track record which has helped it to grow internationally.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will commit $450 million over five years to start a Public-Private Co-Innovation Partnership for Government agencies to work with private sector companies in co-developing innovative solutions for medium- to long-term needs, in areas such as urban mobility, environmental sustainability and energy security. This could include small and untested companies. Key Government agencies will share their technology roadmaps and future needs publicly, and provide grants to help companies test-bed innovative solutions to meet these needs.</p><p><br><I>Improving access to growth finance</I></p><p><I><B><br></B></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies aspiring to grow and eventually become significant players in <p align=left>Column: 2249</p>markets abroad need capital at various stages of their development. Existing schemes like SPRING&rsquo;s Local Enterprise Finance Scheme are working well. Following the ESC&rsquo;s recommendations, we will strengthen the availability of both growth capital to young companies and financing for companies&rsquo; expansion overseas, including to emerging markets.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the hurdles companies face &ndash; not only in Singapore, but in many countries &ndash; is in securing finance at a very early stage of their growth. In recent years, there has been a shift in the venture capital industry towards later stage companies, especially towards those at the mezzanine stage, in other words, pre-IPO. So, there is a gap at the early stage of the company's growth. To bridge the gap, we will help strengthen the availability of early-stage and more patient financing.</p><p><br><I>Attracting investors to nurture start-ups</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to encourage more angel investments, and we will do this by incentivising private individuals with appropriate investment and business expertise to provide financing to start-ups. Angel investing is at the higher end of the risk spectrum, with less assurance of returns. Successful angel investors nurture start-ups not just by contributing funds, but also by providing mentorship, and access to business networks and markets. We have a few well-known angel investors in Singapore, and we want to encourage more investors who can add value to start-ups.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will therefore introduce a new incentive for angel investors. Under this incentive, an eligible angel investor who commits a minimum of $100,000 of equity investment in a qualifying start-up in a given year can claim 50% tax deduction on his investment at the end of a two-year holding period. This deduction is subject to a cap of $500,000 of investments in each Year of Assessment. <p align=left>Column: 2250</p>SPRING will administer the scheme for eligible angel investors and qualifying start-ups. The scheme will be available for the next five years and is expected to cost the Government $60 million over the period.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Catalysing growth capital for SMEs</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies also need growth capital beyond the start-up phase. The Government will help catalyse financing for companies that have achieved initial success and are looking to scale up. However, the Government cannot pick winners. Our role will be that of the co-investor, relying primarily on the expertise and business networks of private fund managers. This is also essential to ensure commercial discipline in investments.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will mobilise up to $1.5 billion of growth capital by seeding a range of funds over 10 years, for which the Government will contribute up to half the capital.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will implement the new co-investment programme in phases. We cannot hope to find good companies simply by pouring in liquidity. We will grow the programme in tandem with the appetite of the investing community and with the number of companies they find attractive.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first phase will be launched this year, with the Government providing up to $250 million to match private sector investments. This will allow for a few funds to be established, with a combined total of $500 million of growth capital for Singapore-based enterprises. So, the first phase will be up to $500 million, with half the sum of up to $250 million being provided by the Government.</p><p><br><I>Government's role in cross-border financing</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we will also strengthen the market for cross-border finance, which <p align=left>Column: 2251</p>has been one of the key hurdles faced by Singapore companies. The ESC has studied the issue and obtained feedback from both banks and the corporate sector. The Government agrees that we should find ways to plug existing gaps in the financial markets arising out of structural constraints.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These gaps are not unique to Singapore. Most other markets face the same difficulties, with commercial banks on their own being unable to fully meet the needs of internationalising companies. Most other markets &ndash; including, in fact,&nbsp; the mature financial centres &ndash; have specialist financial institutions for cross-border financing, whether in the form of Export-Import Banks (EXIM Banks) or Export Credit Agencies (ECAs).&nbsp; The ESC has recommended that a specialised institution in Singapore along similar lines can help plug market gaps in cross-border financing.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognise that Government support may be required for such an institution to insure long-term risk. However, we agree with the ESC's view that any such institution must be commercially-managed, with the discipline to generate a fair return commensurate with the risks. Its business model must also involve collaboration with other financial institutions so as to catalyse cross-border funding.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government is studying various models and evaluating how best we can realise the development of a market-based institution to support and catalyse the growth of cross-border financing for Singapore-based companies.</p><p><br><I>Growing our role as a global business hub</I></p><p><B><I><br></I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also introduce additional incentives to encourage the expansion of specific economic activities with high <p align=left>Column: 2252</p>growth potential. The details of the specific schemes that I am going to go through will be the Annex*.&nbsp; I shall go through them fairly quickly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Grow international legal services</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will extend the Development and Expansion Incentive scheme to law practices providing international legal services so as to enhance our position as an arbitration hub. Under this incentive, approved law practices will enjoy a 10% concessionary tax rate on incremental income derived from performing international legal services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Promote financial services and transport hub</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to update our tax incentives for the financial services sector to ensure that they remain relevant, and encourage institutions to build up high value activities and expand their professional teams in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also introduce a tax incentive to grow shipbroking and extend that for maritime financing activities. In addition, I will expand the scope of GST zero-rating for the marine industry.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) business is a growing opportunity for Singapore. To further enhance our competitiveness, I will renew the Investment Allowance scheme which grants an additional 50% allowance for aircraft rotables for another five years.&nbsp; The rules for claiming the allowance will also be liberalised.</p><p><br><I>Other tax measures</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To encourage test-bedding of clean technologies, I will enhance the Transport Technology Innovation Development Scheme (TIDES) for new green vehicles. I will also expand the scope of the Green <p align=left>Column: 2253</p>Vehicle Rebate scheme to include imported used green vehicles.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's entertainment scene is emerging as an important part of our appeal as a global city. To attract more internationally-rated acts and performances, I will reduce the withholding tax rate of non-resident public entertainers from 15% to 10% for five years.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will introduce flexibility for travellers to purchase an additional litre of duty-free wine or beer in lieu of one litre of duty-free spirits. So, travellers who prefer wine or beer to spirits can now enjoy duty-free allowance on two litres of wine and one litre of beer, or two litres of beer and one litre of wine. This has the makings of a suitably difficult PSLE Maths question. [<I>Laughter.</I> ]</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also introduce several GST-related changes to reduce compliance costs for businesses.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More details on all these changes, along with other minor tax changes, are set out in the Annexes* to the Speech.<br></p><p></p><p></p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\"><p>*Cols. 2313-2332; 2299-2338;2341-2344.</p><BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>INCLUDING ALL SINGAPOREANS IN GROWTH</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Growth with opportunities for all</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are embarking on a major transformation of our economy. We will deepen skills and expertise at all levels, build up our companies' capabilities for innovation, internationalise, and make Singapore a vibrant global city.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we must continue to build a society where every Singaporean shares in the country's growth. The key strategy for achieving this is to raise skills and productivity in every trade and at every level of the workforce. Global competition will continue to threaten the jobs and press down the wages of lower-skilled workers in the coming years. All globalised economies are facing this challenge, <p align=left>Column: 2254</p>including those which are growing rapidly. Countries which have sought to slow down globalisation and protect their people from foreign competition have paid a heavy price in slower growth.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We introduced WIS as a major Government intervention to support the income of older low-wage workers and encourage them to stay in the workforce. With the enhancements to the scheme this year, a 55-year old worker earning $1,000 a month will receive an additional 18% top-up to his or her pay through the WIS.&nbsp; So, it is a significant intervention.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we cannot build an inclusive society by depending on Government transfers alone. The fundamental way to raise and sustain incomes for our low-wage workers is to help them to boost their skills, add to their confidence and enable them to contribute more in the workplace. Every individual, putting in the effort to improve, can then be worth more on the job and secure a better income.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major investments that we are making to build up a first-rate system for continuing education and training, with special provisions for low-income Singaporeans, and to help companies create better jobs, are therefore central to our strategy of ensuring that all Singaporeans can share in growth. We are also assuring every child access to the best education from pre-school to tertiary level, with enriched pathways for different learning abilities, and substantial subsidies for the lower-income groups, so that every family can aspire to a better future.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now turn to some additional specific measures that&nbsp;we will take in this year's Budget that will benefit both our lower- and middle-income households.</p><p><br><I>Shift to a progressive property tax Regime</I></p><p><B><I><br></I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, property tax.&nbsp; We will shift from our current system of a flat property tax <p align=left>Column: 2255</p>rate for all owner-occupied residential properties to a system of progressive property tax rates based on the Annual Values (AVs) of these properties.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the removal of estate duty in 2008, property tax serves as our remaining form of tax on assets. I had explained in 2008 when we removed the estate duty that the duty was impacting the middle and upper-middle income groups disproportionately compared to wealthier ones. At that time, when we were considering whether to do away with the estate duty, we had considered raising the exemption limits for non-residential assets, which are primarily financial assets, so as to correct this problem where middle-income and upper-middle income families were being hurt disproportionately compared to the wealthier ones.&nbsp; However, doing so, raising the thresholds, would have further shrunk what was already a narrow base for estate duty and rendered the tax less effective.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had also stated then that we intended to retain property tax in Singapore. Property tax did not affect our middle and upper-middle groups more than the wealthier ones. Further, it could not be tax-planned away unlike some elements of the estate duty system.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will therefore keep property tax as a means of redistribution in our society, together with our income tax regime.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Income is taxed on a progressive basis in Singapore, which means we collect more taxes from the top income brackets&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; not only because they earn more but because the tax rate that they pay is higher.&nbsp; The top 10% of our working population accounts for about 94% of our total personal income tax collected. However, we have to keep income tax rates low in Singapore to maximise <p align=left>Column: 2256</p>incentives for enterprise and hard work, so that our economy remains dynamic and all Singaporeans benefit.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our property tax system currently does tax the wealthy more than others, because investment residential properties are taxed at 10% whereas owner-occupied homes are taxed at 4%. So, there are some elements of differentiation between the wealthy, who often have additional investment properties, and those who only have owner-occupied homes. However, there is scope for us to introduce further progressivity in property taxes.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A moderately progressive property tax system, together with an income tax system that collects more taxes from better-off individuals and a flat GST rate that everyone pays, will together form a fair system of taxes in Singapore. Everyone pays something, but the rich pay more. Taken together, the overall burden of taxes will and must remain low by international standards.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our current system of property tax rebates aimed at supporting the lower- and middle-income groups was introduced together with the GST in 1994. It has significantly reduced property tax payable by HDB flat owners. However, as HDB homes gradually appreciate in value over the long term, flat owners will see an increasing property tax bill over time.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We provided special, additional rebates in January this year. On top of the 1994 rebates which had remained, we provided additional rebates in January this year, to mitigate the increases in tax payable as a result of increase in rentals and hence, AVs of HDB flats over the last two years. However, we need a longer-term solution that provides a fair and balanced system for all property owners.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will therefore replace the 1994 GST rebates with a simple but progressive tax <p align=left>Column: 2257</p>schedule for owner-occupied residential property.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will introduce three tiers of tax rates &ndash; 0%, 4% and 6% &ndash; under the new schedule for owner-occupied residences. The first $6,000 of AV will be exempted from property tax. The next tier will be taxed at 4%, and the balance of AV in excess of $65,000 will be taxed at 6%. This new schedule will apply for property tax payable from January 2011.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This new system of property taxes is similar in concept to that of personal income taxes, where exemption is provided up to a minimum threshold of value, and progressively higher rates are applied at higher values. There is no change to the property tax structure of non-owner occupied residential properties and other properties, which will remain at a flat rate of 10% of AV.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This new system &ndash; 0%,4%,6% in three tiers &ndash; will benefit most Singaporeans. All owner-occupied homes will enjoy tax savings of $240 as a result of the exemption of the first $6,000 of AV. This will mean that all HDB flat owners and the large majority of private property owners will pay lower taxes, compared to the current system.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Owners of high-end properties with AVs of more than $77,000 will see a small increase in tax payable, as their effective tax rates will be higher than the current 4%. They comprise the top 3% of private owner-occupied residential properties, or the top 0.4% of all owner-occupied homes in Singapore. Homes with AVs of about $80,000 will face only a small increase in tax, of slightly less than $100 per year. A property with an AV of $150,000, which typically is a large property in the central districts and is within the top 0.5% level of private owner-occupied homes, will face an <p align=left>Column: 2258</p>increase in property tax of about $1,500 per year.&nbsp; So when you take it together, the vast majority, not just HDB flat owners but of private property owners, will benefit from the system.&nbsp; A small minority will begin to see increasing tax rates next year, but most of them will see a very small increase in tax rates.&nbsp; Those with&nbsp;&ndash; very high-end properties&nbsp;&ndash; and I gave the example of $150,000 AV&nbsp;&ndash; will see a meaningful increase in property tax of about $1,500 a year.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, our property tax rates, even for the high-end, will remain lower than in most international cities.&nbsp; That is as it should be, so that we remain a vibrant and attractive place for businesses and individuals alike.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This new progressive system of property taxes for owner-occupied homes will lower taxes for the vast majority of Singaporeans, and will cost the Government about $230 million a year initially.&nbsp; And I have to emphasise that we are introducing a scheme that is going to benefit the majority, and is going to cost the Government more through reduced property tax revenues.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Increasing tax reliefs for families</I></p><p><I><B><br></B></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, tax reliefs, under our income tax system. I am also making changes to our income tax reliefs, particularly to benefit our middle-income groups, and especially families providing support for their elderly and their handicapped members.</p><p><br><I>Increase in parent relief</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I will be increasing the parent relief to give greater recognition to those who are looking after their parents and grandparents.&nbsp; Compared to the past, we will be seeing more families where the elderly have to be looked after by fewer children. I will hence increase the parent <p align=left>Column: 2259</p>relief, and also enhance the relief for taxpayers who are taking care of handicapped parents and grandparents.</p><p><br><I>Expansion of wife relief to spouse relief</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, I will also allow wives who are taxpayers to claim a spouse relief of $2,000, similar to the current scheme for husbands. This will help families where the wife is the breadwinner, for instance where the husband has retired. Accordingly, wife relief will be renamed as \"spouse relief.\"</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Enhancing dependant reliefs</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next revision concerns the income threshold for all our dependant-related reliefs &ndash; in other words, the maximum income, currently $2,000, that a dependant can be earning in order that the taxpayer can claim relief for supporting him. The dependants are not allowed to earn more than $2,000 if the taxpayers are to claim relief for the dependants. I will increase the income threshold for dependant-related reliefs from $2,000 to $4,000. This increase recognises taxpayers' efforts in supporting family members who are genuinely dependent, while giving them the flexibility to do some incidental work.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, in recognition of the extra resources and attention needed in taking care of the disabled, I will remove the income threshold for handicapped dependant-related reliefs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These changes in family-related reliefs will be implemented from Year of Assessment 2010, with the details in Annex 3*.</p><p><br><B>Increase course fee relief</B></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also increase the tax relief for course fees. Consistent with our support <p align=left>Column: 2260</p>for lifelong learning, I will increase the course fee relief from $3,500 to $5,500 with effect from Year of Assessment 2011. Next, charitable giving.</p><p><br><B>Support for charitable giving</B></p><p><B><I><br></I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, I had increased the tax deduction for donations made in 2009 to Institutions of Public Character (IPCs) and other approved institutions from 200% to 250%. With the economic downturn, corporate donations nevertheless fell, and understandably. However, tax deductible donations from individuals held steady at $200 million. Many charities found that the additional tax deduction was helpful in attracting donations especially given the difficult state of the economy. To encourage both individuals and corporates to give more as the economy recovers, I will extend the 250% tax deduction for an additional year.</p><p><br><B>Measures to support households</B></p><p><I><B><br></B></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, Singaporeans will continue to benefit from transfers to households that have been introduced in previous Budgets, including the fourth and last tranche of GST Credits and Senior Citizens&rsquo; Bonus, and U-Save, S&amp;CC and HDB rental rebates.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will provide additional special top-ups in this year's Budget to help older Singaporeans as well as families with children.</p><p><br><I>Top-up to CPF Medisave Accounts</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I will provide a one-off top-up to the CPF Medisave Accounts of older Singaporeans aged 50 and above. Most Singaporeans aged 50 to 59 will receive a top-up of $200 to $300.&nbsp; The majority of those aged 60 to 69 will get a top-up of $300 to $400, while those aged 70 and above will receive a top-up of $400 to $500 (see Table 1*). The Medisave top-up will benefit slightly more than one <p align=left>Column: 2261</p>million Singaporeans (1.02 million) and will cost the Government $310 million.<br></p><div style=\"mso-element: footnote\"><I>Top-ups to Medifund and ElderCare Fund</I></div><div style=\"mso-element: footnote\"><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will also set aside an additional $200 million in this year's Budget for Medifund which supports needy Singaporeans and another $200 million for the ElderCare Fund as part of our ongoing efforts to set aside funds to meet our long-term healthcare needs.</div><div style=\"mso-element: footnote\"><br><I>Top-up to Post-Secondary Education Accounts</I></div><div style=\"mso-element: footnote\"><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We set up the Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) scheme in 2007 to support families with children. Together with our enhanced bursaries and financial assistance schemes, the PSEA helps to encourage every family to put their children through a tertiary education at our ITE, polytechnics and universities.</div><div style=\"mso-element: footnote\" align=\"left\"><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will provide a further top-up to PSEA accounts (see Table 2*). Children in primary school will receive up to $200 in their accounts, while those between 13 and 20 years old will receive up to $500. With this latest top-up of $500, a secondary school student living in a HDB home who has benefited from the previous top-ups would have $1,900 in his account, which is about 85% of the cost of polytechnic tuition fees for one year.<br></div><div style=\"mso-element: footnote\" align=\"left\">&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Six hundred and fifty thousand young Singaporeans will benefit from this additional top-up, which will cost the Government $230 million.</p><p><br><I>Impact of transfers to households</I></p><p><B><I><br></I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking all our measures together, we will be spending $1.4 billion this year in direct transfers for households. Inclusive of the WIS, the total sum transferred to households is $1.8 billion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2262</p>While most Singaporeans will receive some benefits, more will go to those with lower and middle incomes. Let me give two examples to illustrate this.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is a low-income household, around the 20th percentile of the population, staying in a three-room HDB flat. The family comprises two working adults in their 30s, earning $1,800 and $800 a month, and an elderly parent in her 60s. The person with monthly income of $800, who is the wife in her 30s, will receive WIS . She will receive $1,100 this year which includes the special payment which we announced last year.&nbsp; Together with their GST Credits, Senior Citizens' Bonus, and Medisave top-up for the elderly parent, and their U-Save, S&amp;CC and property tax rebates, the family can expect to receive about a total of $2,900 in benefits in 2010.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next example I will give is for a middle-income family, say, a five-room HDB household between the 60th and 70th percentile of incomes.&nbsp; The benefits that they receive will also be significant. There are two working parents, with neither eligible for WIS. However, with two children, one in secondary school and the other in polytechnic, the family will receive PSEA top-ups. In total, it will receive about $1,700 in benefits.</p><p><br><B>BUDGET POSITION</B></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now summarise the FY2010 budget position.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We expect a basic deficit of $7.2 billion for FY2010 (the basic deficit refers to the balance of Operating Revenues and Expenditures before taking into consideration the Net Investment Returns Contribution and the top-ups we are making to our endowment and trust funds). This basic deficit at 2.6% of GDP is slightly smaller than what it was last year, when it was 3.3% of GDP.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2263</p>Our Net Investment Returns Contribution is more than sufficient to fund this basic deficit. Before top-ups to trust funds and endowment funds, the budget would see a small surplus of about $0.6 billion (0.2% of GDP) for FY2010.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our underlying revenue position remains sound.&nbsp; Although our tax revenues this year will continue to be held down by the lagged effects of the recession, they are expected to recover in the coming years. We are therefore moving ahead with major investments in our future &ndash; in education and training, healthcare for a gradually aging society and the transport infrastructure required to connect up the island.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also investing to support the major uplift in productivity that Singapore must achieve over the next 5 to 10 years &ndash; raising skills across the board, and promoting enterprise innovation and restructuring. The resources that we set aside for the National Productivity Fund and the National Research Fund represent the Government's long-term commitment to help build an economy driven by innovation and productivity.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of careful fiscal management during this term of Government, we are able to invest ahead.&nbsp; While we will see an overall budget deficit of around $3.0 billion (1.1 % of GDP) for FY10 after taking into account the top-ups to our endowment and trust funds, this is a manageable deficit as we have sufficient current reserves to fund it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our priority during last year's global crisis was to keep jobs. Our priority must now be to improve the quality of jobs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have set ourselves the goal of growing Singapore's productivity by 2% to 3% per year, over the next decade. It is an ambitious target, but we can achieve <p align=left>Column: 2264</p>it through a comprehensive national drive by our people to deepen their skills and expertise, and by our enterprises to innovate and create value in new ways.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higher productivity is how we will achieve higher incomes and improve living standards, including those of low-wage workers. With 2% to 3% productivity growth each year, we can raise incomes by one-third over a decade, in real terms.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will commit substantial resources to support this national effort. But it is ultimately the skills, ingenuity and drive of our people and companies that will determine if we succeed.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every employer must take the initiative. They have to re-design jobs to make their employees more productive, and keep asking how they can help their people reach further and accomplish more. Companies must look for continuous improvements and breakthrough ideas, so as to compete based on new products and designs, distinctive brands or better service. More of our companies must now aspire to become leaders in Asian markets.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be a nation that recognises and rewards many routes to success &ndash; whether by growing skills on the job, entrepreneurship, academic and professional training, scientific discovery or creative flair. But it also means a different motivation. Workers have to invest time to improve ourselves, taking years where necessary to build up expertise, and not be satisfied with doing the minimum or even being competent on the job. More Singaporeans must want to achieve mastery of the job &ndash; as machinists, engineers, teachers and counsellors, animators or even mixologists (8).&nbsp; For those who are not familiar with mixologists, Wikipedia calls them \"pouring professionals\" &ndash; bartenders who specialise in cocktail mixtures. According to Wikipedia <p align=left>Column: 2265</p>too, the term usually implies special expertise and professionalism [<I>Laughter in the House</I> ]. And when we talk about a different motivation, our companies themselves have to aim to be the best they can be, beyond the immediate profits they earn.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no expiry date for learning. Whatever our age, we can continue to learn, upgrade and add value. Ms Pauline Ten, now 51, is one of many who exemplifies this. She joined the workforce five years ago as a part-time worker at Han's Cafe &amp; Cake House, juggling this with being a homemaker. Soon after, she joined their full-time service crew, picked up skills on the job and became a supervisor after two years. She then went for external training on customer service, and raised her capabilities further. After four years on the job, she was promoted to an outlet manager, bringing her pay to $1,800 &ndash; about $1,000 more than when she started. She is now being groomed to be an area manager in the Han's group.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, we are charting a new course for our economy, growing it by improving productivity. This will put us onto a virtuous cycle: building superior skills, quality jobs and higher incomes. It will also sustain healthy economic growth, giving us the resources to fulfil important goals of our society &ndash; caring for our elderly, nurturing our young through a first-class education system, helping low-<p align=left>Column: 2266</p>wage workers or those without jobs to earn a good living, and safeguarding our country's security.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, we have strengths to build on &ndash; our willingness to adapt to changed circumstances, our tenacity in overcoming the limitations of a small country and our will to succeed.&nbsp; These are real assets which will help us achieve this next transformation in our economy.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As commercially-driven companies, they have to be innovative and exploit new business opportunities to remain viable.&nbsp; For example, the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) was quick to launch online versions of the <I>Straits Times</I>, <I>Business Times</I> and <I>Lianhe Zaobao</I>.&nbsp; MediaCorp also has an online version of <I>TODAY</I> newspaper.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While media companies in other countries encountered financial difficulties, we had avoided the same through prudent management and a sound working relationship between employers and staff.&nbsp; Readership of our local dailies, both offline and online, is healthy.&nbsp; Readership of the newspapers has gone up&nbsp;by 5% between 2008 and 2009 while that for their online versions has increased by 45% during the same period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The readership of our local newspapers has remained strong despite the multitude of news sources on the Internet.&nbsp; According to the latest Nielsen Media Index survey conducted between July 2008 and June 2009, 75% of those surveyed selected newspapers as their preferred source of news.&nbsp; At the same time, online news portals such as ChannelNewsAsia.com and AsiaOne have consistently ranked among the top \"news and media\" websites visited by Singaporeans(1).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many reasons why this is so. One key reason is that the mainstream media in Singapore has continued to remain a trusted news source. The mainstream media is accurate, timely and balanced in their reporting.&nbsp; A <I>Business Times</I> article on 5 February 2010 reported a survey(2) conducted by the US-based Public Relations firm, Edelman, which revealed that 68% of the respondents in Singapore found newspapers to be the most trusted source of information.&nbsp; This is significantly higher than the international average of only 34% which trusted newspapers as a credible source of information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MediaCorp has also been quick to reinvent itself.&nbsp; In October last year, it launched MediaCorp NewsHub, the first of its kind in Asia.&nbsp; As a one-stop centre for news content that cuts across the print, radio, television and Internet platforms, the news hub provides the public with access to the latest news&nbsp;&ndash; anytime, anywhere&nbsp;&ndash; from radio, TV, print and online platforms, ranging from bite-sized information and video clips to in-depth stories and analysis.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a content provider for entertainment purposes, MediaCorp has done well by continuously reviewing and refreshing its programming strategies.&nbsp; Viewership for its TV channels has remained high, garnering nearly 80% of resident population annually over the past two years.&nbsp; MediaCorp's radio stations also enjoy strong growth in listenership over the past two years, with more than 3.6 million listeners every day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2269</p>In conclusion, it is important for Singapore's mainstream media to remain commercially sound through prudent practices, to be the trusted source of news and information and to produce high quality work in order to remain the most attractive and popular choice of the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p>(1)&nbsp;Source: HitWise<br>(2) The survey polled 200 people in Singapore and a total of 4,875 worldwide, including the US, Britain, China and India.&nbsp;</p><BR></div></P></div>\t<p align=left>Column: 2269<p>\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:OUTREACH EFFECTIVENESS OF ONLINE MEDIA--><!--END_COL_TITLE:OUTREACH EFFECTIVENESS OF ONLINE MEDIA:::2272--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>OUTREACH EFFECTIVENESS OF ONLINE MEDIA</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad </B>asked the Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (a) whether he will provide an assessment of the Government's progress in the dissemination of news and public information in the online media; and (b) how does his Ministry assess the effectiveness of the level of outreach in the online media compared to the mainstream channels of news publications and public broadcast channels.&nbsp;<br></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>RAdm [NS] Lui Tuck Yew:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government uses both the mainstream and online media to disseminate news and public information. Since 1995, the Singapore Government has maintained an online presence, starting with websites which are now known as Web 1.0 platforms.&nbsp; As technology evolved, Ministries and government agencies have complemented their websites by increasingly tapping on a wide range of Web 2.0 platforms to communicate and engage with the public. &nbsp;These include popular and interactive social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr, podcasts, Wikipedia and so on. &nbsp;The Government's online presence is used to provide information and explanation about Government policies for public education, outreach and campaigns, crisis communications and public consultation.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, during the H1N1 episode, the Ministry of Health and the Health Promotion Board provided information, regular updates and advisories to the people via its MOH website, the crisis.gov.sg website, a dedicated H1N1 website and through various social media platforms. &nbsp;In the lead-up to the National Day Parade, the organising committee used a variety of social media channels and a Web 2.0-equipped microsite to reach out to Singaporeans. &nbsp;For the National Day Rally Speech by the Prime Minister, the Government also tapped on a variety of social media platforms to bring the speech live to netizens and to encourage online feedback and discussion.&nbsp; Various social media platforms will also be used to promote upcoming events this year, such as the Youth Olympic Games.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REACH has revamped its website and it also has a presence on Facebook and Twitter. It will also introduce new features and services to make its portal even more user-friendly for the public to give feedback to and engage with the Government. The <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=http://www.gov.sg\"\">www.gov.sg</a> website is undergoing a revamp, and serves as the official online communication platform of the Government, providing a one-stop portal access to Government information and services and key feedback channels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the mainstream and new media are important avenues to disseminate news and&nbsp;public information. The latest Nielsen Media Index survey conducted between July 2008&nbsp;and June 2009 indicated that the readership of newspapers in Singapore has remained steady with 75% of the local population choosing newspapers as their preferred source of news.&nbsp; According to the 2010 Edelman Trust Barometer, 68% of local respondents(3) cited newspapers as their most trusted sources of information in Singapore, compared to the international average of 34% for newspapers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2271</p>The online versions of our newspapers also saw a significant rise in readership from 282,000 visitors daily in 2008 to 408,000 visitors daily in 2009, a rise of about 45%(4), with four key websites &ndash; straitstimes.com, AsiaOne, Stomp and RazorTV &ndash; seeing 5.2 million unique visitors in January(5).&nbsp; The latest data from online traffic tracker HitWise found CNA, AsiaOne, ZB, ST, Stomp, BT, MyPaper among the top 10 \"news and media\" sites most visited by Singaporeans.&nbsp; With more Singaporeans, particularly those in the younger age groups, turning to multiple sources for information, both offline and online, it is important for the Government to take a holistic approach and leverage on both the mainstream media and online media to reach out to Singaporeans.<br></p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Other subjects like English and Malay have seen improvements over the same period.&nbsp; In 2001, there was a drop in the proportion of students scoring A* to C grades in PSLE but this was observed across all the ethnic groups and was due to earlier changes in the promotion criteria which allowed some students who previously would have been in the EM3 stream to sit for Standard PSLE Mathematics and Science papers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some students who are weak in English would find difficulty in their Mathematics and Science PSLE examinations.&nbsp; This applies to students of all races, not just Malays.&nbsp; To address this, Learning Support programmes to improve English and Mathematics are available in all primary schools.&nbsp; These programmes are taught by trained teachers using specifically developed techniques to focus on and help weaker students improve and catch up with their peers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools will do their part in helping weaker students improve.&nbsp; But MOE also works in partnership with community groups such as Mendaki, parents support groups and other VWOs to provide extra support for these students.&nbsp; Parents and families, of all races, can support students by ensuring that they attend school regularly, motivating them to work hard, and adopting good habits like reading widely.&nbsp; Community and self-help groups can also help families deal with problem issues related to finances, jobs and relationships, in order to create a more supportive home environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p></span>\t<p align=left>Column: 2273<p>\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

MND, MOT and MHA.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Town Councils' Common Property and Open Spaces by-laws, Town Councils can take action against persons who post notices or advertisements on common property without prior approval from the Town Council.&nbsp; On conviction, the offence carries a maximum penalty of $5,000.&nbsp; Under the Building Control (Outdoor Advertising) Regulations, an outdoor sign or signboard cannot be displayed without a licence from the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).&nbsp; The offence attracts a maximum fine of $5,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The illegal display of notices at bus stops, MRT stations and on lamp posts is prohibited by the Street Works (Advertisements on Road Structures, Road Related Facilities and Public Streets) Regulations, and has been addressed by the Ministry of Transport's response to Dr Lim Wee Kiat's question on this issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the facts of the case warrant it, a person who illegally posts a notice on public property may also be charged for vandalism under the Vandalism Act, mischief under the Penal Code or Intentional Harassment under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.&nbsp; If convicted of vandalism, a person may be fined not exceeding $2,000 or imprisoned for a term not exceeding&nbsp;three years.&nbsp; A person convicted of mischief is liable for imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or a fine, or both. For committing intentional harassment, a person may be fined a maximum of $5,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, the Police arrested eight persons for vandalism.&nbsp; BCA compounded around 670 offences for unlicensed display of outdoor advertisement signs and signboards. Town Councils issued six summonses for the illegal posting of notices. Generally, when asked to do so, offenders would remove illegally posted notices&nbsp;in housing estates.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, the response to the problem of illegal display of notices is calibrated in accordance to circumstances of the case, as reflecting the severity of the offence.&nbsp; For the vast majority of the cases, the offence committed is not serious and is rectified by the removal of the notice. At the same time, agencies are exploring innovative solutions to ameliorate the situation. For example, LTA has piloted the use of anti-stick paint to prevent advertisements and notices from being pasted onto lamp-posts.&nbsp; Some Town Councils have also written to real estate agencies to advise them against posting their notices in housing estates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2275</p>While the various agencies would continue to deal with such notices and advertisements which fall under their purview, let me assure&nbsp;Er Lee that blatant acts of vandalism, mischief or intentional harassment will not be tolerated.

Last year, 149 such cases were lodged.&nbsp; Amongst these cases, 16 cases in 2007 and 26 cases in 2008 involved pregnant employees. Last year, 56 cases involving pregnant employees were lodged. The increase could be due to a variety of factors including greater awareness of maternity protection for pregnant employees as a result of heightened publicity and the recent enhancement of maternity leave benefits.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Employment Act, employees who feel that they have been unfairly dismissed, could appeal to MOM against the dismissal. The Ministry would investigate these cases and if the dismissal is deemed to be without just cause or excuse, the company will be required to reinstate or compensate the employee. The majority of cases received by the Ministry were mediated and amicably resolved between the employee and employer, sometimes with a settlement payment. Some 3% of cases received were found to be dismissals without just cause, and the companies involved were required to compensate the employee.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to cases on complaints of unfair dismissals involving executives, we received&nbsp;one case in 2008 and 12 cases in 2009 which are related to pregnancy. Executives dismissed on grounds related to pregnancy could appeal against unfair dismissal to MOM and if found to be valid, the company will be required to reinstate or compensate the employee. For non-pregnancy related disputes including alleged unfair dismissals on other grounds, the Ministry provides mediation assistance. On average, about 270 executives seek MOM's assistance each year. Close to half of such disputes were resolved amicably. The rest of the cases were withdrawn, or the employee sought settlement with their employer directly or through the civil courts, after consultation with the Ministry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our workforce is becoming better educated and more skilled, with a growing number joining the executive ranks. In this regard, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) recently announced plans to introduce a dispute resolution process to help junior and mid-level Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) resolve common employment disputes with their employers. MOM targets to launch this new initiative for PMEs by 2011. The details are currently being worked out in consultation with the tripartite partners.<br></p></p></span>\t<p align=left>Column: 2277<p>\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:NOISE POLLUTION FOR HOMES NEAR SELETAR AIRPORT--><!--END_COL_TITLE:NOISE POLLUTION FOR HOMES NEAR SELETAR AIRPORT:::2280--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>NOISE POLLUTION FOR HOMES NEAR SELETAR AIRPORT</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Er Lee Bee Wah </B>asked the Minister for Transport with the increasing use of Seletar Airport as a base for aerospace maintenance, repair and overhaul in Asia (a) whether the Ministry is aware of the noise pollution caused by aircraft when they fly over low rise housing estates in the area; and (b) what is the current policy for aircraft when they fly over such residential areas.<br></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in July 2009, Er Lee from Ang Mo Kio GRC had asked a similar question and the House was informed about the measures taken to minimize the potential impact of aircraft noise in the planning and development of the Seletar Aerospace Park.? Consultancy studies and noise measurements carried out by CAAS and JTC showed that, with the measures, noise levels will still be well within internationally established development planning norms for residential areas near an airport.&nbsp; Let me now touch on the key measures that have been taken.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAAS seeks to minimise the need for aircraft to overfly residential areas in the design of flight paths around Singapore's airports.&nbsp; However, it is not possible for all aircraft flight paths to avoid overflying residential areas altogether.&nbsp; Flight paths of aircraft landing at or taking off from an airport have to be aligned with the runway. For safety reasons, there is also the need for these profiles to be clear of adjacent airports. As such, there is little leeway to alter or divert the flight paths of aircraft operating at Seletar Airport and it is unavoidable that some flights will overfly nearby residential areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Seletar Airport, CAAS will minimise aircraft landings from the south where most of the residential housing are located.&nbsp; This is to avoid aircraft overflying the residential areas and thereby reduce the noise disturbance.&nbsp; However, landing from the north is not always possible as this is dependent on the prevailing wind direction.&nbsp; To further reduce the noise, CAAS has also imposed altitude restrictions requiring aircraft to be no lower than 1,500 ft (about 450 metres) when they have to overfly the residential areas to the south and west of Seletar Airport.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another noise abatement measure taken is to prohibit training flights and cargo flights between the hours of 10.00 pm to 7.00 am daily, the period when residents are resting and sleeping.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, CAAS disallows older and noisier jet aircraft that do not meet international standards on aircraft noise from operating into Singapore.&nbsp; Jet aircraft which operate to Seletar are generally newer-generation ones which are quieter and meet these standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAAS will continue to monitor the noise level closely and regularly review the aircraft noise abatement measures for improvement where appropriate, taking into account any new technological advancements that could enhance flight safety, and further minimise noise disturbance to residents.<br></p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The working group, chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Manpower, is pursuing various measures to help employers understand the benefits of an integrated workplace and to build capabilities to manage diversity. For example, in April this year, the tripartite partners will be organising a conference on fair and inclusive employment practices, which contribute to workplace harmony. This will provide an opportunity for employers, unions and workers to exchange ideas on how to better manage diversity in the workplace, to build inclusiveness, harmony and strong teamwork. MOM will also be developing a database of best practices for managing diversity in the workplace, and educational material addressing common challenges and misconceptions on workplace integration. We are also exploring with industry how to enhance human resource practitioners' capabilities in managing a diverse workforce.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOM and our tripartite partners also lead the Businesses and Unions Cluster of the Community Engagement Programme (CEP), a programme set up to build trust and unity among various groups in Singapore and to ensure business continuity in times of crisis. The cluster has introduced initiatives and organised outreach activities that equip employers, unions and workers to promote harmony in their workplaces, and address tensions and conflicts that may arise in emergencies. The tripartite partners have also developed publicity materials and a Tripartite CEP Guide, which contains information about the role that businesses and unions play in the CEP, as well as workplace-specific guidelines. The guide has been distributed to more than 23,000 employers, HR practitioners and union leaders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While MOM together with our tripartite partners will continue to promote workplace harmony and integration, achieving workplace integration will require a collective national effort involving all stakeholders.<br></p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:LOW-WAGE WORKERS NOT GETTING WORKFARE INCOME SUPPLEMENT--><p align=left>Column: 2281<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:LOW-WAGE WORKERS NOT GETTING WORKFARE INCOME SUPPLEMENT:::2284--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>LOW-WAGE WORKERS NOT GETTING WORKFARE INCOME SUPPLEMENT</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Terry Lee--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Terry Lee </B>asked the Minister for Manpower (a) how many low-wage workers did not receive the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) as a result of losing their jobs in 2009; (b) how can the criteria be reviewed to benefit more low-wage workers; and (c) what is the total WIS payout in 2009 as compared to the budgeted sum.&nbsp;<br></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 30,000 employees who were recipients of WIS in 2008 no longer received WIS in 2009 because they did not fulfil the work criteria.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The BRIC countries are among the fastest growing economies in the world.&nbsp; They are widely expected to emerge as key growth engines for the global economy over the next 10 years.&nbsp; The burgeoning middle class and rapid urbanisation in these countries have created significant opportunities to grow our trade and investment with them. And indeed, we have been capitalising on these opportunities.&nbsp; Based on latest available data, Singapore's exports of goods to the BRIC countries have grown by 15.4% per annum from 2000 to 2009, much faster than the 5.7% per annum we have seen to the rest of the world, while our exports of services from 1999 to 2008 have grown by 24%, faster than the 14% annual rate to the rest of the world. Singapore's stock of foreign direct investment in the BRIC countries has grown by 3.4 times over 10 years (from 1999 to 2008)(2) and accounted for 18.3% of our total foreign direct investment stock abroad in 2008, up from 14.9% in 1999.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International Enterprise (IE)&nbsp;Singapore's overseas centres in the BRIC countries reflect our growing trade relations and the interest of Singapore-based companies in these markets. The BRIC countries account for 14 out of IE Singapore's total of 36 overseas centres.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;nine centres in China,&nbsp;three in India and an office each in Brazil and Russia.(3). In the case of China, we have gone beyond the first tier cities to open centres in less well-known but promising cities like Chongqing and Xi'an.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But while the term&nbsp;\"BRIC countries\" is a convenient label to describe these rapidly growing economies, the opportunities that each of them presents varies widely. MTI thus adopts a differentiated approach for each of the BRIC countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our economic relations with China and India are well established. China and India are our 3rd and 10th largest trading partners respectively.&nbsp; Singapore is linked to China and India through both bilateral and regional FTAs through ASEAN.&nbsp; These FTAs have reduced barriers to trade and created new opportunities for our businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of China, MTI has also established various engagement platforms at the Government-to-Government level.&nbsp; The Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC), the Investment Promotion Committee, as well as provincial-level business councils, have been effective platforms to discuss mutually beneficial areas of cooperation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond these formal platforms, IE Singapore actively encourages and facilitates exchanges at the company level.&nbsp; This is done through organising seminars, and business missions to explore opportunities in a wide range of sectors.&nbsp; Similarly, as more Chinese and Indian enterprises look to expand their operations abroad, EDB and IE have been promoting Singapore as a location for their regional and global headquarters and as a hub for international trading.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 2289<p>China and India are not only important to us as markets for our companies but also as sources for tourism.&nbsp; Tourist arrivals from these two countries stood at 1.66 million last year, and STB has set up seven offices in these two rapidly growing markets.(4)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our economic relations with Brazil and Russia are still at a nascent stage. The geographical distance between Singapore and these two countries has meant a lower degree of familiarity among our companies with these markets. Russia and Brazil were our 27th and 29th largest trade partners respectively in 2009.&nbsp; In order to enhance bilateral trade and investment activities in these countries, we have to continue to extend our networks with the government and business communities, and deepen our understanding of their markets.&nbsp; At this stage of our engagement, we will first focus on facilitating business interest in priority sectors such as oil and gas, urban solutions and consumer products, as well as promoting Singapore as a commodity trading hub for the Russian and Brazilian mega-traders who are keen to expand their Asian presence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enhance our relations at the Government-to-Government level, MTI established a joint committee with Brazil's Ministry of Development, Industry and Commerce (MDIC) in 2009 to serve as a platform to promote bilateral economic cooperation and business flows.&nbsp; We have also established business platforms, <I>vis a vis</I> &nbsp;the Latin-Asia Business Forum and the Russia-Singapore Business Forum, to engage Brazilian and Russian businesses, as well as government leaders, on investment and partnership opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MTI will continue to monitor the opportunities in the BRIC economies, as well as the interest and demand from our companies, and regularly review the degree of our engagement and presence in these countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to IMF estimates, all the&nbsp;four BRIC markets are forecasted to have positive growth potential. The compounded average growth rates (CAGR) of these markets (2010-2014) are also projected to be higher than that for the rest of the world as shown in the table below:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>Estimated Gross Domestic Product, Current Prices (USD, Billions)</B></p><p class=\"ListParagraph\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

Among young children aged&nbsp;six years and below, there are about 1,400-2,000 children a year who are diagnosed as having developmental delays.&nbsp; Among those of school-going age in mainstream and special education (SPED) schools, 2.5% have some disability. Among adults, the 2001 National Health Surveillance Survey by the Ministry of Health reported that 1.9% of respondents aged 18 and 59 years old had difficulty with self-care.<p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div><p align=left>Column: 2297<p>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P>\t        <!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t<div align=left><span class=normal>Section Name: BUDGET</span></div><BR><div align=left><span class=normal>Title: ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</span></div><BR><div align=left><span class=normal>Filename : <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100222/Annex to Chart 1.pdf'\">Chart 1 (Meridian Income per Singaporean Household Member)</a></span></div><BR>\t  \t\t\t        \t<div align=left><span class=normal>MP Name: Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</span></div><p align=left>Column: 2299</p>\t<div align=left><span class=normal>Filename : <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100222/Annexes to Anuual Budget Statement 220210_1_.pdf'\">Annexes to Annual Budget Statement</a></span></div><p align=left>Column: 2339</p>\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<div align=left><span class=normal>Filename : <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20100222/Table 1 and Table 2.pdf'\">Tables 1 and 2 (Top-up to Medisave and PSEA)</a></span></div><BR>\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t<div align=left><span class=normal>Section Name: WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</span></div><BR><div align=left><span class=normal>Title: BRIC COUNTRIES</span></div><p align=left>Column: 2345</p><div align=left><span class=normal>Filename : <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/Figure 1.pdf'\">Figure 1 (Level of Singapore's Trade & outward investments)</a></span></div><BR>\t  \t\t\t        \t<div align=left><span class=normal>MP Name: Mr Lim Hng Kiang</span></div><BR>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
