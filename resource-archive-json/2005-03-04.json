China and India.&nbsp; With the rise of China and India in the region, both will flex their muscles and be respected as emerging global powers.&nbsp; China, with its growing economic and military capabilities, will be a big factor in regional calculations.&nbsp; One view is that China will seek to avoid conflict in the region and focus on economic growth and internal stability.&nbsp; The other view is that a strong China will seek to adjust regional power arrangements to its advantage, risk conflict with neighbours and some external powers&nbsp;in the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, India will seek to expand its economic and military might too and seek greater engagement with ASEAN and the region.&nbsp; China and India will seek, in their own way, a greater involvement in regional matters and will want to be acknowledged as emerging powers.&nbsp; Both countries are keen to secure economic and natural resources in the world, and rivalry with each other and other powers to secure these natural resources will pose a challenge in the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The question arises then:&nbsp; how does Singapore, as a country and as part of<p align=left>Column:1500 </p> ASEAN, go about engaging the two countries in a manner that fits their growing power and desire to be recognised as&nbsp;global powers, if not regional powers?&nbsp; How will it fit in with our overall policy of keeping all big powers engaged in a region to ensure our economic prosperity and a peaceful region?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North East Asia.&nbsp; Sir, the triangular relationship between the US, China and Japan will underpin the security and geo-strategic framework in North East Asia.&nbsp; But with relations between Japan and China not being at their best, Japan proposing to amend its constitution to give them the mandate for the self defence forces to be deployed overseas, North Korea blowing hot and cold over its nuclear policy, and&nbsp;the Taiwan issue surfacing intermittently, North East Asia will certainly remain an area for potential big power confrontation.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for his assessment of the state of affairs in North East Asia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on ASEAN.&nbsp; While I am glad to see the group moving ahead with good steam, I would like the Minister to give an update on the state of ASEAN, the progress of the ARF and new initiatives to engage the various regional and global powers in the dialogue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy that Singapore is engaging as part of&nbsp;ASEAN the different regions through APEC, ASEM and, very recently, through the Asia<p align=left>Column:1501 </p> Middle East Dialogue (AMED) and the proposed East Asia Summit (EAS).&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for an update on these dialogues and the new initiatives we can expect to bring the regional blocs together.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister on what is Singapore's position on the participating countries to be invited for the East Asia Summit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, on Middle East.&nbsp; I am glad that Singapore has taken a keen interest in the Middle East and the Arab world, with SM Goh Chok Tong playing a leading role in opening up a new frontier in our relations there.&nbsp; I certainly look forward to Singapore strengthening our relations with many Middle Eastern countries who share similar visions and look forward to closer links.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the new initiatives we will be embarking to develop closer relations with the Middle Eastern countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are playing a pivotal role in ensuring that South East Asia continues to be a place of peace and prosperity.&nbsp; Our leaders are working very hard to ensure that Singapore's interest is respected, our views are given careful consideration in many capitals, and our geo-political strategic outlook taken into account when policies are drawn up.&nbsp; We are respected as an independent and sovereign country.&nbsp; We are, most importantly, seen as being just and fair in our dealings on international matters and in international organisations.&nbsp; This is due to good leadership in the past and present, and also having a team of good diplomats who understand and defend Singapore's vital interest at all times.&nbsp; I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our diplomats for keeping the Singapore flag and our reputation flying high in the international arena at all times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, Singapore's relations with Malaysia and Indonesia are very important with implications on the mood and development not only of the three countries but also of the South East Asian region.&nbsp; As a region, we are living in challenging times.&nbsp; On the security front, terrorism and piracy still pose a danger.&nbsp; On the economic front, the region is facing increasingly intense competition from low-cost countries such as China and India.&nbsp; Those <p align=left>Column:1502 </p>countries hit by the tsunami disaster, especially Indonesia, face the costly prospect of reconstruction. And politically, some countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, have just undergone political transition.&nbsp; But I would argue that we are in a better position today than we have been for a long time to forge a closer partnership with each other to build a stronger region.&nbsp; First, all three countries&nbsp; -&nbsp; Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia&nbsp; - have new leaders who are forward looking and who have emphasised their resolve to strengthen relations further.&nbsp; Second, all three leaders have been able to demonstrate through their actions that the specific disagreements between their individual countries and Singapore should not be allowed to define the broader relationship and over-shadow the many areas that we cooperate with each other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But some old thorny issues remain, and they can set back the good progress made if we are not careful.&nbsp; With Malaysia, the old issues are a legacy from the Mahathir era, and I am glad that Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi have met recently to discuss the steps to take the talks forward.&nbsp; But I note that now even Johore wants to have a public say in the negotiations, as Johore Mentri Besar Abdul Ghani Othman was quoted as saying, \"The state wants to be heard on three key areas&nbsp; -&nbsp; reallowing Singapore military aircraft into Malaysian airspace, the water price review and the proposed bridge.\"&nbsp; Sir, I am not sure that this state-centric approach will help the two countries to resolve the outstanding issues with the larger regional cooperation in mind.&nbsp; Indeed, much of the focus of the Malaysian media and Johore politicians seem to centre around the issue of the bridge.&nbsp; Previously, it was a crooked bridge, but now the Malaysian proposal is for a straight one.&nbsp; While I do not see why the Causeway should be demolished for this, I would like to ask the Minister if <p align=left>Column:1503 </p>there is any merit at all to this idea of a straight bridge, and if it can bring any benefit to Singapore as well, and the&nbsp;cost, taking into account the long-term view and the larger picture of regional cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will stand firm on fundamentals but we must be broad-minded enough to accommodate Malaysia's interests where our own national interests are not diminished.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Indonesia, the issue of the extradition&nbsp;treaty, among other issues, is also an old one, but we seem to have moved forward on this.&nbsp; According to newspaper reports, PM Lee Hsien Loong was quoted as saying that Singapore would sign a treaty with Indonesia following his meeting with the Indonesian President.&nbsp; Sir, Indonesia has, for nearly a decade, sought an extradition treaty with Singapore, but we have been&nbsp;reluctant to do so.&nbsp; Certainly, concluding an extradition treaty will allow both sides to focus on more important and pressing issues.&nbsp; Can I ask the Minister why Singapore has decided to go ahead to work on this treaty now at this time after years of expressing reluctance to do so?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister's update on our relations with China, US and India which have also been evolving.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

ASEAN meetings are unfortunately viewed, whether rightly or wrongly, often by outsiders as talk shops where officials hand out statements, speeches, declarations, joint communiques and memorandums of understanding, and little of substance is achieved.&nbsp; One has difficulty, in fact, keeping track of the scores of documents that are churned out at ASEAN Summits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1504 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At ASEAN meetings, the underlying principle is that ASEAN must resolve problems and face challenges in the spirit of solidarity, cooperation and consensus building.&nbsp; These are nice words and the language that flows out at such meetings&nbsp;is inevitably couched in diplomatic language that sometimes tells you little.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A case in point is the issue of terrorism.&nbsp; It is a regional security issue that threatens all ASEAN countries.&nbsp; Yet, information and action from countries where the source of terrorism originates is difficult and slow to come by.&nbsp; Another case in point, hampered by the policy of non-interference in other member's affairs, Thailand's problems with Muslim insurgents in its south cannot be discussed at ASEAN level, although it is an issue that threatens to blow up and affect our member states.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

So many deadlines have been announced in the past - in fact, so many ideas and deadlines have been announced&nbsp;that I myself am&nbsp;confused whether, at times, ASEAN is talking about a FTA or a common market, or do they mean the same thing - the latest I hear&nbsp;is the creation of an&nbsp;ASEAN Economic, Social and Security Communities by 2020, but I thought that ASEAN first talked about a free trade area in 1976, and now after 29 years we are told we have to wait a further 15 years to attain some kind of economic community.&nbsp; So you can understand my confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the next 15 years will allow time for ASEAN&nbsp;to set even later deadlines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another case in point that underlines ASEAN's credibility is Myanmar's membership. Even with the continual arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi by the military regime, ASEAN continues to pretend that<p align=left>Column:1505 </p> all is well and praises the efforts of the regime to bring about a transition to democracy. Here we have a person whose party won elections in 1990, and for 15 years has been under house arrest; so you have to really take it with a pinch of salt when the leaders of ASEAN&nbsp;make statements saying that what is happening in&nbsp; Myanmar is actually making progress towards democracy and political reform.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, the credibility stakes for ASEAN will be raised further next year because that is when Myanmar takes over the&nbsp;chairmanship of the organisation. Other countries have called Myanmar all sorts of names, some are so crude that I would not even mention them in the House.&nbsp; But already a number of ASEAN dialogue partners have said that they will not attend ASEAN meetings next year, including the ASEAN&nbsp;Regional Forum in Yangon next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So where does that leave ASEAN in the eyes of the world?&nbsp; Can ASEAN afford to be led by a member state which has little respect from the rest of the free world?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that Singapore as one of the founding members of ASEAN - and certainly one of its more respected ones - can do much more to shake up the organisation and restore its credibility.&nbsp; We have to work with like-minded members to jolt Myanmar into action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1990s, ASEAN applied pressure on Cambodia and pushed the&nbsp;leaders towards reform by accommodating the opposition before it allowed Cambodia to join ASEAN.&nbsp; Likewise, we can do the same with Myanmar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without these concrete steps, I am afraid ASEAN will continue to be viewed as a paper mill churning out&nbsp; piles and piles of documents that attract little attention not only from outsiders, but<p align=left>Column:1506 </p> even from its own people.&nbsp;

Obviously, the initial discussion on ASEAN + 3 has been on currencies, capital flows and investments in the region.&nbsp; But something could perhaps be developed out of this to enable ASEAN to move towards a new level.&nbsp; We have seen the development of EU and over the last decade, the tremendous development.&nbsp; Of<p align=left>Column:1507 </p> course, there are problems always with integration but, at least, attempts are made truly and honestly forward in integrating economies, bringing down tariffs,&nbsp;and allowing free flow of factors of production, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My view is, with all these talks and dialogues which have been going on in ASEAN for years, leading not necessarily to very visible goal-posts, should we spearhead or really review what could be done?&nbsp; What is the Ministry's thinking towards this future development, and whether in the development of things in the world, if we continue to talk and not walk the talk,&nbsp;would ASEAN run the risk of being irrelevant?</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ravindran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

\"If Myanmar does not address the problem, then not only Myanmar is going to be affected but the credibility and integrity of ASEAN as a whole is going to be affected.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Senior Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong has recently met with Malaysia's Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi.&nbsp; We read from the newspaper reports that they had a very good and fruitful meeting.&nbsp; However, no details were released on the progress of their discussions on bilateral issues.&nbsp; In particular, I believe Singaporeans are interested to know whether we have made progress on the water agreement discussions.&nbsp; Singaporeans are relieved to <p align=left>Column:1509 </p>hear from our leaders that we&nbsp;have sufficient water and would not need to renew the 2011 Water Agreement with Malaysia;

<B>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</B>&nbsp; Sir, Singapore-Malaysia ties constitute a very&nbsp;important component of our foreign relations and our relationship with Malaysia has taken a positive turn after the assumption of leadership by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water, Sir, is no more an intractable problem or issue as far as we are concerned.&nbsp; We can move ahead on this.&nbsp; The reclamation issue at the Straits is largely settled.&nbsp; The Pedra Branca issue is brought to the International Court of Justice.&nbsp; However, there is still a host of issues to be negotiated, for example, CPF payments to Malaysians, the use of Malaysian air space by the Singapore Air Force, the Malayan railway land and the bridge at the Causeway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how these issues are to be tackled and what is the timeframe he has in mind.&nbsp; Will they be negotiated item by item or will they be negotiated as a package?&nbsp; Is the Minister hopeful that these issues will be concluded amicably and in good time?&nbsp; What is the outcome of Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong's recent second meeting with Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi said that there are some low-lying fruits which are easy to reach and should be picked first.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister what, in his<p align=left>Column:1513 </p> view, are these low-lying fruits, and on whose trees are these low-lying fruits?&nbsp; And who are going to pick them first?&nbsp; Are they ripe for the picking?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A veteran Johor politician, Datuk Shahrir Abdul Samad, has recently suggested that the Malaysian proposal for the crooked bridge, which was Dr Mahathir's initiative, be dropped.&nbsp; But he was immediately attacked by his fellow politicians.&nbsp; In my view, Datuk Shahrir Abdul Samad's position is logical and very sensible, and very much what anyone with some common sense would support.&nbsp; Even the opposition PAS commented that the bridge was a wasteful project and was not necessary at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask whether the Minister agrees with Datuk Shahrir and lends his important support to such a sensible move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<B>Dr Ong Chit Chung</B>:&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; Sir, Singapore has firmly, consistently and clearly supported the one-China policy.&nbsp; Singapore was amongst the first to make it a policy to recognise Beijing as the rightful and only authority for \"one China\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come what may, Singapore has not shifted from this&nbsp;position.&nbsp; We have never been swayed by Taipei or the pro-Taipei lobbyist groups throughout the world.&nbsp; We were therefore perplexed by the storm created over an unofficial private visit by our then Deputy Prime Minister to Taiwan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, both Singapore and China have much to gain through close economic cooperation and investments and mutual understanding and respect.&nbsp; We are a small country compared to the PRC,<p align=left>Column:1514 </p> which is a rising economic power.&nbsp; But countries, big and small, should always respect each other's sovereignty and interests. I am therefore glad that the storm has subsided and calm has prevailed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read recently that the PRC Ambassador to Singapore commented that the Singapore-PRC relationship is back to normal.&nbsp; I hope that the relationship is not only back to normal, but will grow and deepen over time.&nbsp; Singapore can invest further in the PRC, leveraging on the PRC's resources, manpower and markets, and thereby help to create more jobs in the PRC, while PRC can send thousands upon thousands of their tourists to Singapore, which I am sure we would all welcome.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to ask the Minister on his reading of Singapore-PRC relationship, how we can manage this relationship and move forward.&nbsp; Are there any concrete or practical plans to deepen the relationship between Singapore and PRC?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</B> Sir, as a small sovereign country, Singapore has adopted the correct foreign policy to make friends with as many countries as possible and develop win-win relationships.&nbsp; This policy of strengthening bilateral relations with countries, especially the growing economies, like China and India, will become more crucial as globalisation brings countries closer.&nbsp; Although Singapore always tries to develop bilateral relations based on mutual respect and mutual benefit, we do encounter occasional hiccups in bilateral relations due to changing circumstances, such as change in political leadership and domestic situations in various countries.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the recent private visit by Mr Lee Hsien Loong to Taiwan is an example of how bilateral relations could be affected due to changing circumstances in other countries.&nbsp; Despite Singapore maintaining<p align=left>Column:1515 </p> a consistent one-China policy, the visit had caused some uneasiness in China.&nbsp; Sir, sometimes our actions and viewpoints are not clearly understood, or deliberately being misunderstood by others, thus causing strains in bilateral relations.&nbsp; In a volatile world, we must always be careful and sensitive in maintaining and further strengthening our bilateral relations with other countries.&nbsp; We must also put in more efforts to better understand and respect the national interests of other countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to suggest a simple strategy which we can adopt in strengthening bilateral relations with other countries.&nbsp; That is to practise what a Chinese phrase states:&nbsp;<I>duo</I> <I>cheng zan, shao pi ping</I>.&nbsp; What it means is \"More compliments and less criticisms\".&nbsp; Sir, compliments will normally help to strengthen ties, while criticisms tend to strain relationships.&nbsp; If all Singaporeans adopt this simple philosophy, I believe we can avert many awkward situations where political leaders or people of other countries have to defend their political or national positions at the expense of bilateral positions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to make the following suggestions on strengthening our bilateral ties with China.&nbsp; First, we should encourage more interactions between Singapore and China at all levels - political leaders, Government officials, business community and people.&nbsp; Networking at all levels will help strengthen friendships among our people and thus deepening bilateral ties.&nbsp; We can provide more scholarships for students and teacher exchanges.&nbsp; Second, we must facilitate more business partnerships among businessmen of the two countries to conduct businesses both in Singapore and China.&nbsp; Third, we can tap on the network of our Chinese clan associations in Singapore to further develop ties with community-based organisations in China.&nbsp; This will further promote understanding of <p align=left>Column:1516 </p>both our cultures and values.&nbsp; Fourth, more dialogues or exchange of views or experiences can be conducted through the Internet, such as online social network or e-forum to connect the people of the two countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, although it is difficult to measure and quantify the strength of bilateral relations, I would urge the Government to establish some indicators where we can measure the progress of our efforts in foreign relations.&nbsp; These could be&nbsp;in the form of a number of people involved in various exchange programmes, number of visitors, surveys on mutual understanding of peoples of different countries or the value of business partnerships or projects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to seek the following clarifications from the Ministry:&nbsp; (1) What is the status of bilateral relations between Singapore and China?&nbsp; (2) What initiatives are taken by the Government to further strengthen bilateral relations? (3) Are there plans to further improve people-to-people relations of both countries?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><I>Singapore-PRC-Taiwan Relations</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Leong Horn Kee</B>:&nbsp; Sir, this issue of our relations with PRC and Taiwan is rather sensitive.&nbsp; It is important that the matter be understood properly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China is an important trading partner, not just for Singapore but to the rest of the world.&nbsp; Its economy is growing at a very fast pace.&nbsp; I understand that the greater China, including Hong Kong and Macau, is already Singapore's largest trading partner, overtaking the USA.&nbsp; Some analysts have projected that, by 2025, that means, 20 years' time, China will become the world's largest economy,&nbsp;surpassing the USA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has always maintained cordial relations with both PRC and Taiwan.&nbsp; However, last year, we encountered some relations problems with<p align=left>Column:1517</p> PRC&nbsp;when&nbsp;PM Lee Hsien Loong visited Taiwan on a private trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, in February, it was reported that China has said it wanted to move forward its relations with Singapore and welcome PM Lee Hsien Loong to visit China frequently.&nbsp; This call was made by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao after a meeting with our Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr George Yeo, when he visited China.&nbsp; It was also mentioned that China is interested to have a bilateral free trade agreement with Singapore under the framework of the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement.&nbsp; These are encouraging developments.&nbsp; In fact, as said by Dr Ong Chit Chung, the Chinese Ambassador to Singapore, Mr Zhang Yun, was reported to have said that, recently, China's relations with Singapore has completely returned to normal.&nbsp; It said here, \"<I>Zhang Yun&nbsp;da shi: &nbsp;xin zhong guan xi wan&nbsp;quan&nbsp;hui fu&nbsp;zheng chang</I>\" - Singapore-China relations completely back to normal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we wish to maintain cordial relations with PRC because of its economic potential, we also have to preserve our sovereign rights to deal with other countries and entities.&nbsp; For example, we have on-going relations with Taiwan.&nbsp; I am curious to note that Taiwan President Chen Shuibian was reported to have said that he agreed to cooperate with the Taiwanese Opposition leader James Soong to work towards better cross-straits relations with China.&nbsp; Actually, both China and Taiwan have huge stakes in peace across the straits.&nbsp; It was reported that Taiwan invests about US$3 billion each year in mainland China.&nbsp; And China is now the biggest purchaser of Taiwanese goods.&nbsp; About 500,000 Taiwanese&nbsp;live in Shanghai and the Yangtze River Delta.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the recent events and developments with respect to China and Taiwan, I would like to hear from the Minister an <p align=left>Column:1518 </p>update on our relations between ourselves and China and Taiwan.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hawazi Daipi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><I>Peace Prospect in the Middle East</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Hawazi Daipi</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I would like to commend the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for continuously looking for new ways and new areas of cooperation with the world.&nbsp; In the process, we safeguard our interests and we enlarge our role.&nbsp; Our move to strengthen relations with the Middle East, both at bilateral and regional level, is a case in point.&nbsp; Senior Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong has had a number of successful visits to Middle Eastern countries in the past one year.&nbsp; Singapore and, of course, the regions, both Asia and Middle East, can benefit from this improved political and economic relationship.&nbsp; But much of it depends on whether peace prevails in the Middle East.&nbsp; There has been some prospect. Apparently, to me, Israel and the Palestinian authority have renewed negotiations for peace.&nbsp; The Gulf states are developing at&nbsp;ferverish rate.&nbsp; But there are of course a&nbsp;few questions over Iraq and the possible US attack on Iran.&nbsp; I would like the Minister to give his assessment on the prospect for peace in the Middle East and how we can benefit from possible peace in the region.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo):</B> Sir, let me thank Members for their thoughtful and helpful comments about our foreign policy. Let me first reply to Mr Ravindran and Ms Irene Ng on changes in the strategic landscape,&nbsp;the impact on&nbsp;Singapore and our response to these changes.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last 15 years have seen a steady dissolution of the old Cold World War Order.&nbsp; Gradually emerging in its place is a new configuration,&nbsp; the full shape of which is still not very clear.&nbsp; Globalisation has thrown up new challenges and opportunities for all countries.&nbsp; Global terrorism, particularly Jihadist terrorism, is a dangerous counter current which we have to confront together with other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1519</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exciting changes are taking place in Asia,&nbsp;Europe, the&nbsp;Middle East and South America.&nbsp; Without wanting to sound too optimistic, the regional and global landscape is looking brighter with reasonably stable relations among the major powers, the slight easing of tension in cross-straits relations, an improvement in Indo-Pakistan relations and some positive developments in the Middle East.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asia is, on the whole, doing well.&nbsp; The economies of East Asia&nbsp;have largely recovered from the Asian financial crisis.&nbsp; Despite SARS and the recent tsunami, our economy has shown remarkable resilience.&nbsp; We are becoming more integrated.&nbsp; The rise of&nbsp;China and&nbsp;India is the&nbsp;big story, as many Members have pointed out,&nbsp;in fact, probably the biggest ever in human history.&nbsp; Already,&nbsp;China has overtaken the&nbsp;US as the largest export market for an increasing number of Asian economies.&nbsp; &nbsp;China has just become Japan's largest trading partner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the rise of&nbsp;China and India will also bring about a shift in the global and regional balance of power and create new tensions.&nbsp; We need new institutional arrangements in the world and in the region to accommodate the peaceful re-emergence of these two giants.&nbsp; For Singapore, we now have an unprecedented opportunity to increase significantly our international space.&nbsp; Singapore, as we know, was established by the East India Company from&nbsp;India for the&nbsp;China trade in the 19th century.</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

Step by step, we are recovering all the links which created modern Singapore -&nbsp;our links to Southeast Asia, China, India, indeed, the entire subcontinent and&nbsp;the Middle East.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we continue to&nbsp;make the right moves in the public and private sectors, our international, political, economic and cultural space will be greatly expanded in the coming years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1520 </p><p>12.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key elements in our foreign policy must be: &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Working with&nbsp;our neighbours to integrate ASEAN.&nbsp; And ASEAN, for all its imperfections, remains, as pointed out by Mr Tan Soo Khoon and others,&nbsp;very important to us;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Strengthening our links to the advanced economies of the US, Japan, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.&nbsp; We do not talk about them very much at this COS, but they remain very important to us;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Building new links&nbsp;to&nbsp;Northeast Asia,&nbsp;South Asia, the Middle East and South America;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;And also supporting better global governance through the UN and the WTO.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me touch briefly on each of these elements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>ASEAN</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN is a \"paper machine\", as Mr Tan pointed out.&nbsp; Sometimes, it is understandable that we should be impatient with&nbsp;its elliptical processes, that&nbsp;we seem to spend a lot of time talking, backtracking and&nbsp;then moving forward again, not always moving in a straight upward course.&nbsp; But if we take a step back and look at ASEAN in its historical development, it has been very good for all of&nbsp;Southeast Asia.&nbsp; When President Soekarno was leading Indonesia, ASEAN was not possible because he had a certain view of the Nusantara in the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under President Soeharto, Indonesia promoted regionalism, and so&nbsp;ASEAN was born.&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN was only possible because Indonesia,&nbsp;the largest country, showed restraint, accommodating&nbsp;countries big and small.&nbsp; So, Brunei when it became independent,&nbsp;immediately was asked to join&nbsp;ASEAN.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1521 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the&nbsp;Cold War, when Vietnamese divisions crossed the Mekong and threatened us, ASEAN was galvanised to action at the UN and other&nbsp;international forums and helped&nbsp;maintain the peace which&nbsp;enabled us to develop economically for many years.&nbsp; Then, when the Indo-China war ended, to our initial surprise, one of the first things that Vietnam did was to ask to apply to join ASEAN.&nbsp;&nbsp; And even though it is by no means a perfect organisation, relations within the region have been kept soft.&nbsp; We do not&nbsp;have armies massing along borders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you compare ASEAN as a regional grouping&nbsp;with similar groupings in South America or other parts of the world,&nbsp;we are probably the most successful grouping among developing countries.&nbsp; And when we are suddenly seized by big issues like SARS or the tsunami, the instinct to coalesce is now deep in us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So while I agree with Mr Tan that we should push harder and bring forward our deadlines, I would not discount or under-rate the importance of ASEAN to all of us in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look&nbsp;ahead to the future, as we see the re-emergence of China and India presenting us with new challenges,&nbsp;we&nbsp;see ASEAN as becoming&nbsp;even more important in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the leaders met in Bali,&nbsp;they issued the Second Bali Concord.&nbsp; Yes, there were&nbsp;high-minded expressions of our desire to form the ASEAN&nbsp;Economic Community,&nbsp;ASEAN Security Community&nbsp;and an ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community.&nbsp; But even though these are broad statements, there will be follow-up.&nbsp; Bit by bit, our lines of communication will interconnect, our standards will be harmonised, our tariffs are coming down, and a habit of consultation will define the way we interact with one&nbsp;another in Southeast Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;That habit is very important.&nbsp; During the Asian financial crisis, when Indonesia went through a very trying period and many of us worried about<p align=left>Column:1522 </p> whether ASEAN would remain viable, the meetings that we had programmed for kept us going together, and&nbsp;maintained a certain steady course of action.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, Sir, a strong integrated ASEAN is at the heart of our overall strategy in our foreign policy.&nbsp; Without such an ASEAN, Singapore would find it much more difficult&nbsp;to take advantage of the new opportunities in the world.&nbsp; Worse, a weak ASEAN&nbsp;means that Southeast Asia would be&nbsp;balkanised, and&nbsp;new security problems would appear.&nbsp; For this reason, Singapore is a tireless supporter of ASEAN's political, economic and social integration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tan Soo Khoon asked what is the difference between the Free Trade Area and the Economic Community.&nbsp; The Free Trade Area expresses a common desire to bring tariffs down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tariffs are coming down all over the world anyway.&nbsp; But the Economic Community takes us a step further into the areas which go beyond tariffs,&nbsp;to services, to the harmonisation of standards and increasingly, to the settlement of disputes in an institutional way.&nbsp; And although this was not noticed by many people, at&nbsp;Bali, the leaders made an important decision:&nbsp;&nbsp;for the first time, trade disputes would be referred to independent dispute settlement panels instead of being resolved by Ministers,&nbsp;because with&nbsp;Ministers, problems tend to be blurred and ambiguous decisions&nbsp;made.&nbsp; Little by little now, because disputes will go to&nbsp;these panels, the&nbsp;way agreements are&nbsp;drafted legally will become very important, and in the coming years, an ASEAN jurisprudence of resolving trade disputes will grow.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are studying closely the early steps taken by the Europeans -&nbsp;the Coal and Steel Community,&nbsp;the Common Market,&nbsp;and the European Community.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;think we will ever become&nbsp;like the&nbsp;European&nbsp;Union, but the coming steps&nbsp;of ASEAN may follow quite closely the early steps of the European Community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1523 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within ASEAN, as many hon. Members have pointed out, we need to build stronger relations with our immediate neighbours, in particular with&nbsp;Indonesia and Malaysia. And let me now touch on each in turn.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Indonesia</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Ravindran and Mr Leong Horn Kee pointed out,&nbsp;President Yudhoyono's recent visit to Singapore was a great success.&nbsp; He gave a lecture and&nbsp;&nbsp;a business seminar and both were very well attended.&nbsp; Many guests had to be turned away.&nbsp; President Yudhoyono&nbsp;wants Singapore to be a major partner in Indonesia's economic development.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;between MTI and Indonesia's Economic Ministries, many things are being cooked.&nbsp; President Yudhoyono&nbsp;thanked us for the assistance we rendered to Indonesia after the tsunami.&nbsp; On a number of strategic issues, like the East Asia Summit, we share common positions.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have stepped up bilateral cooperation across a wide field.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently,&nbsp;Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam was in Indonesia to sign an agreement on cooperation between our education institutions - so start early, start with young people, so that we will know each other better.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a few bilateral issues which are complex and would take time to resolve.&nbsp; One such issue is the extradition treaty raised by Ms Irene Ng and Mr Leong Horn Kee.&nbsp; It is not an easy agreement to negotiate, which is why we avoided it for many years.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;about two years ago, PM Goh and President Megawati decided that it was time&nbsp;to begin working on the extradition treaty.&nbsp; And we are&nbsp;committed to concluding expeditiously an extradition treaty with Indonesia which is in line with the provisions of our&nbsp;domestic laws and beneficial to both sides.&nbsp; But the negotiations will have to define clearly the offences which are extraditable.&nbsp; And we want terrorism to be included.&nbsp;&nbsp;We must&nbsp;<p align=left>Column:1524 </p>take care to ensure that an agreement meant to further bilateral relations will not end up causing serious misunderstanding later.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;once an extradition treaty is in place, the courts in each country may have to sit in judgment of the judges, prosecutors and police of the other country.&nbsp; So, rather than papering over our differences,&nbsp;in rushing to conclude an agreement, we had &nbsp;better be very careful about the details so that when the&nbsp;agreement is in place, it will enhance bilateral relations,&nbsp;not cause new problems for the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also started technical discussions on boundary delimitation between the two countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both PM Lee and President Yudhoyono do not want existing bilateral issues to overshadow the overall positive relationship and hinder the progress of new initiatives which are mutually beneficial, such as air services and tourism cooperation.&nbsp; And as pointed out by some Members, the signing of the Investment Guarantee Agreement during President Yudhoyono's recent visit to Singapore sent a good signal to investors on future bilateral cooperation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Malaysia</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our bilateral relations with Malaysia raised by Mr Ravindran, Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Hawazi Daipi and Dr Ong Chit Chung,&nbsp;&nbsp;in fact virtually by every MP,&nbsp; they have improved since Mr Abdullah Badawi took over as Prime Minister in October 2003.&nbsp; After a lapse of many years, we resumed the annual games between Singapore's MFA and Malaysia's Wisma Putra.&nbsp; I had to pick up my golf clubs again. Datuk Syed Hamid said, \"Look, instead of the Singapore team versus the Malaysia team, we have combined teams.\"&nbsp; So I partnered him and he was a very good partner,&nbsp;giving me mulligans.&nbsp; He encouraged&nbsp;me to&nbsp;relax and so,&nbsp;I played better than I expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During PM Lee's introductory visit to Malaysia last October, the two leaders&nbsp;<p align=left>Column:1525 </p>agreed that Singapore and Malaysia should explore new areas of cooperation and look ahead rather than be held back by old problems.&nbsp; Yes, the old problems have got to be tackled&nbsp;but let us&nbsp;see them in perspective and let us&nbsp;not&nbsp;hold everything hostage to these old issues.&nbsp; That is a practical,&nbsp;constructive approach which&nbsp;will benefit both sides.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior Minister Goh has met Prime Minister Abdullah&nbsp;Badawi&nbsp;twice since to discuss the outstanding bilateral issues.&nbsp; And the most recent meeting took place just a few days ago.&nbsp; They had a constructive discussion - I am&nbsp;choosing my words very carefully -&nbsp;and agreed on the steps to move discussions forward.&nbsp; Both sides also agreed not to publicise the details of the discussions at this juncture.&nbsp; I know many of you want my views on the \"straight\" bridge, the \"crooked\" bridge, the Causeway, water, airspace, the railway agreement, and so on.&nbsp; But I have nothing new to add.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof.&nbsp;Jayakumar has briefed this House fulsomely in many previous sessions.&nbsp; Those considerations continue to apply.&nbsp; Our positions have been clearly and openly stated and well known to the House.&nbsp; But at the same time, there are discussions going on;&nbsp;it is best that we do not politicise them.&nbsp; As Ms Irene Ng said,&nbsp;it does&nbsp;not&nbsp;take&nbsp;very much for some of our friends across the Causeway to make all sorts of comments&nbsp;at the drop of a hat.&nbsp; They are not necessarily helpful to bilateral negotiations even though we may&nbsp;be very tempted to respond quickly to them.&nbsp; But,&nbsp;for the time being, since both sides are having good discussions, let us be a little patient and</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>let this continue.&nbsp; In the end, the solutions must benefit both sides and not disadvantage either side.&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with Syed Hamid&nbsp;that the recent talks went well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our political and economic links with Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei and<p align=left>Column:1526 </p> Vietnam have&nbsp;also grown stronger.&nbsp; PM Lee had good meetings in his introductory visits to these four countries.&nbsp; Thailand shares our desire to \"fast-forward\" ASEAN. We were very honoured by the exceptional hospitality extended by the Thai King and the Thai government to President Nathan during his recent state visit to Thailand.&nbsp; And as Mr Leong Horn Kee pointed out, we have deep economic relations with Thailand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the problem of Southern Thailand,&nbsp;that is&nbsp;a complex problem.&nbsp; I was very pleased to read a few days ago that Prime Minister Thaksin has appointed&nbsp;former PM&nbsp;Anand Panyarachun&nbsp;to chair a committee to study this problem in depth and to make recommendations to Bangkok.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Philippines, when PM Lee was in Manila, President Arroyo expressed a strong desire to boost economic ties between the two countries.&nbsp; And&nbsp; we were delighted when His Majesty, the Sultan of Brunei, accepted an Honorary Doctorate from NUS in January expressing the warm and easy relations between the two countries.&nbsp; Our relations with Vietnam have&nbsp;also become increasingly substantive.&nbsp; In recent years, Singapore has become a major investor in Vietnam. The Vietnamese Government would like to see better connectivity between our two economies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tan Soo Khoon and Mr Chay Wai Chuen raised concerns about the danger of ASEAN becoming irrelevant in the face of new challenges in the world.&nbsp; What is our strategy in ASEAN?&nbsp; Our strategy in ASEAN is to make Southeast Asia the fulcrum for a new architecture of peace and cooperation in Asia.&nbsp; And it is a new Asia -&nbsp;from an Asia long colonised by imperial powers, each part reporting to the metropolitan power, the East Indies reporting to Holland, Singapore, Malaya to London and so on;&nbsp;to an Asia which became independent after the war,&nbsp;during <p align=left>Column:1527</p>which&nbsp;big countries like China, India, Vietnam and&nbsp;Indonesia withdrew to rediscover themselves;&nbsp;and now after the Cold War, their re-entry on the world stage.&nbsp; It is a huge and magnificent re-entry.&nbsp; What we are seeing now in China, Vietnam, India and Indonesia - the old links&nbsp;all being restored - people moving up and down, rediscovering their own past and past connections.&nbsp; I have been watching when I was in MTI, the restoration of links between India and China, and how the trade ties have been shooting up exponentially.&nbsp; Even seemingly insoluble problems, like their border demarcation, are being seriously discussed now at the highest levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in this new Asia, which is an opportunity&nbsp;and also a challenge that is&nbsp;being watched closely by Europe and&nbsp;America, we are trying to create a new architecture which best maximises the life chances for all of us in ASEAN.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are our strategies?&nbsp; We are 10 countries, very different from each other, disparate, but situated between the two great civilisational areas of East Asia and South Asia. Historically, we received influences from both.&nbsp; We threaten nobody and therefore we can be friends with everybody.&nbsp; Our strategy is to put ourselves at the centre, so that others who want to&nbsp;deal with each other&nbsp;come through us.&nbsp; Because the climate here is warm and balmy, and the culture is cosmopolitan, people can interact freely and in an informal way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Take, for example, the relations among the three Northeast Asian countries of China, Korea and Japan&nbsp;- all Confucian societies, eyeing each other suspiciously, having relations which are tense and formal.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no regular forum where&nbsp;their leaders meet, except when&nbsp;they&nbsp;come down to our summit meetings&nbsp;- ASEAN + 1, ASEAN + 3.&nbsp; In recent years, they have institutionalised the + 3 Breakfast Meeting on the side where the three leaders meet in our \"house\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1528 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have good relations with North America, the&nbsp;Sub-continent,&nbsp;Australia and New Zealand.&nbsp; That is what we must always try to&nbsp;have because the greater the number of major powers in our house, the more comfortable our lives will be, the greater will be the options available to each and every one of us.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hawazi Daipi spoke of the increasing economic competition from China and India and its impact on ASEAN.&nbsp; Will it weaken ASEAN or will it strengthen ASEAN?&nbsp; I believe it will strengthen ASEAN, because when we watch these two countries loom larger and larger, there is a certain worry that&nbsp;if we do not act, we would be at a serious and severe disadvantage.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you look at ASEAN's history, it is always the external challenge which unites us.&nbsp;First,&nbsp;there was&nbsp;Soekarno in Indonesia, then the Cold War and the Indo-China War,&nbsp;then crises like SARS and the tsunami.&nbsp; And&nbsp;for the future,&nbsp;we must be able to carve out our own place in the sun.&nbsp; So I believe that the emergence of China and India will have a very good, positive effect on the ASEAN construction.&nbsp; Each of us by himself is too small to be treated on any basis of equality by the great powers.&nbsp; But united, we have got to be taken seriously.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, the key is not what we said or&nbsp;the agreements we sign but our economic competitiveness.&nbsp; At the last ASEAN Summit in Vientiane, the ASEAN 6&nbsp;agreed to advance their integration in 11 priority sectors from 2010 to 2007.&nbsp; But I agree with Mr Tan Soo Khoon that a lot more needs to be done.&nbsp; Strategically, we should be patient, but tactically we should be impatient.&nbsp; We must also help the newer member states to catch up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been giving technical assistance to new ASEAN member states through the Initiative for ASEAN Integration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1529 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been playing an active role in strengthening ASEAN's links to all the major powers.&nbsp; All the FTAs that we negotiate with the major powers have this as a long-term objective.&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN's Dialogue Partnerships, the ASEAN&nbsp;+&nbsp;mechanisms and the ASEAN Regional Forum were all founded on this principle: to put ASEAN at the centre, to make it the \"hub\" so that from here, there are many \"spokes\" to the wider region and beyond.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Chay asked how Singapore's interests are&nbsp;being served in an ASEAN + 3 framework.&nbsp; Well, by linking ASEAN to Northeast Asia, for example, we benefit from their economic development.&nbsp; If you look at their economic weights, they are much bigger than we are.&nbsp; In fact, the collective GDP of ASEAN is only one-tenth that of Northeast Asia.&nbsp; So we should latch on to others, Northeast Asia, Japan, US, Europe, Australia and New Zealand in order to maximise the opportunities available for our own companies and individuals.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the key is to&nbsp;have a deep solidarity.&nbsp; Yes, from time to time there are problems. There are always bilateral problems between neighbours, just as we have issues&nbsp;with Malaysia and Indonesia.&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;Thailand has&nbsp;issues with Malaysia, Cambodia and Myanmar.&nbsp; And Vietnam has problems with others and so on.&nbsp; This is normal. This is part of state craft. So long as there is a deep sense of solidarity, and&nbsp;on major issues we&nbsp;stick together, then this construction of&nbsp;putting ASEAN as the hub in Asia can be achieved.&nbsp; And Singapore as a hub in ASEAN which is a hub in Asia, is the best possible world for us, which is why ASEAN's interests and our interests completely coincide.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The East Asia Summit (EAS), to be held in KL at the end of the year, presents another opportunity for ASEAN to be the hub.&nbsp; But, as pointed out by Mr Ravindran <p align=left>Column:1530 </p>and Ms Irene Ng, this is only provided we conceive the EAS well.&nbsp; If the EAS has a membership no different from that of ASEAN + 3, then it will weaken ASEAN.&nbsp; Proposals to have the EAS discuss the big issues leaving ASEAN + 3 to discuss the small issues will weaken ASEAN further.&nbsp; It is also important that the EAS should not be seen by the US, India, Europe and others to be an exclusive East Asian closed grouping because if it is perceived to be such a grouping, it will create all kinds of unnecessary problems for us.&nbsp; For these various reasons, Singapore supports the inclusion of India, Australia and New Zealand in the EAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their inclusion will keep ASEAN at the centre and put it beyond doubt that we are externally-oriented and inclusive in our deep construction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Myanmar</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now, with a heavy heart, talk about Myanmar.&nbsp; I listened carefully to the points made by Mr Ravindran and Mr Tan Soo Khoon about Myanmar's chairmanship of ASEAN next year.&nbsp; We have a problem.&nbsp; Although we have not formally discussed this in ASEAN, I know that many of the Foreign Ministers in ASEAN worry about it.&nbsp; Syed Hamid and&nbsp;&nbsp;Pak Hassan Wirajuda&nbsp;have expressed their views openly; most of the others have not.&nbsp; Myanmar reconvened its National Convention on 17th February 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not yet clear what the way forward would be.&nbsp; And as Mr Tan Soo Khoon pointed out, Aung San Suu Kyi remains in detention.&nbsp; We do not&nbsp;want to interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries.&nbsp; We recognise that the domestic situation in Myanmar is complicated; there are many ethnic groups, there are insurgencies, there are private armies and, in the end, it is for the people of Myanmar themselves to decide on their own destiny.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the much-publicised Roadmap has no timeframe and therefore it is of limited utility and the good efforts of the UN to facilitate and <p align=left>Column:1531 </p>advance the national reconciliation process in Myanmar have so far yielded very little.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why we are concerned is that what happens in Myanmar affects ASEAN as a whole and our relationship with our Dialogue Partners.&nbsp; Last year, ASEAN countries took a firm position with the EU that Myanmar could not be excluded from the Asia-Europe Meeting in Hanoi.&nbsp; We stood our ground and we succeeded.&nbsp; But subsequent developments in Yangon undermined our position.&nbsp; I hope that the ASEAN spirit of consultation and consensus will enable us to find a solution for next year.&nbsp; Unless the Myanmar authorities handle the situation carefully, ASEAN's credibility and cohesion would be jeopardised.&nbsp; The Foreign Ministers will be meeting in retreat next month in Cebu, Philippines, and I expect that they will be discussing this subject behind closed doors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>US, Japan, Europe, Australia and New Zealand</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ravindran asked about our relations with the US and the EU.&nbsp; Our relations with the advanced countries are on the whole excellent.&nbsp; They remain the most important source of investment and knowledge for us.&nbsp; Our ties with the US are broad and deep, founded on common strategic interests and reflected in our extensive defence and economic cooperation.&nbsp; The FTA we concluded has raised our relationship to a new level.&nbsp; We work closely together in the war against terrorism.&nbsp; Our relations with Japan are also strong and multi-faceted.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

Our relations with the EU will be enhanced by the EU-Singapore Partnership and Cooperation Agreement which is currently being negotiated.&nbsp; As the EU gives more attention to Asia, Singapore's importance to Europe will grow.&nbsp; Our links to Australia and New Zealand have deep roots in history.&nbsp; As they become more <p align=left>Column:1532 </p>and more a part of Asia, their links to Singapore become more valuable.&nbsp; Our economic interests in Australia are becoming quite substantial.&nbsp; President Nathan will be making a state visit to Australia next week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>China</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to&nbsp;China, which interests many MPs today.&nbsp; Let me give a broad summary on the current situation.&nbsp; As Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Leong Horn Kee pointed out, the PRC Ambassador here said recently in a media interview that ties between Singapore and China have been fully normalised after the setback last year.&nbsp; I agree with Ambassador Zhang that our bilateral relations are back on track.&nbsp; We now have a better understanding of each other's core interests and&nbsp;this has laid a strong foundation for building an even stronger relationship in the future.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what initiatives are being taken by the Government to further strengthen bilateral ties with China.&nbsp; I had a good visit to China just before Chinese New Year.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had lunch with Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing and called on Premier Wen Jiabao.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also called on my old colleague Minister&nbsp;Bo Xi Lai, who is now in the Commerce Ministry.&nbsp; Before that I visited Liaoning where I was pleased to meet Party Secretary Li Keqiang whom I used to know when he was the First Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Youth League.&nbsp; They were all warm and friendly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A series of high-level exchanges are being planned for this year.&nbsp; We are looking forward to the visit of the Chairman of the National People's Congress Wu Bangguo in May, and as you know Wu Bangguo ranks number two in the Standing Committee.&nbsp; PM Lee and other Singapore leaders will also be visiting China later this year.&nbsp; I have<p align=left>Column:1533</p> agreed with the Chinese that the second meeting of the Joint Council of Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) which is under the direct supervision of PM Wen and PM Lee will be held in Singapore in the second half of the year, and&nbsp;the JCBC has a full agenda covering many things.&nbsp; So all the points which Dr Teo and others have raised will be included.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I called on Premier Wen in Beijing, he also asked for the acceleration of the negotiation for a bilateral FTA within the framework of the ASEAN-China FTA.&nbsp; So I think we will follow up.&nbsp; When I met Secretary Li Keqiang in Liaoning, he asked for Singapore's strategic participation in the development of Changxing Island near Dalian and Yingkou, as part of their overall effort to rejuvenate China's Northeast.&nbsp; They want us to repeat Suzhou in the Northeast.&nbsp; But I do not think we should just replicate an old model because industrial parks are no longer so unique or special, but we should think of other ways to be helpful and to work on projects of cooperation&nbsp;that would benefit both sides.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's links to China continue to grow strongly.&nbsp; Last year, bilateral trade reached S$53 billion, making Singapore China's largest trading partner in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; Dr Teo also asked for people-to-people links and I think these should be expanded.&nbsp; Just this morning, I received a request from a Buddhist organisation to write a message because even among the monks there is more \"<I>lai lai, wang wang</I>\"</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">\u6765\u6765\u5f80\u5f80 (exchanges) and we should encourage all such similar contacts.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee asked about our assessment of cross-straits relations.&nbsp; Although there are small signs of improvement, like the direct air links during the Chinese New Year period, the despatch of Vice Ministers from the Mainland to attend Koo Chen-foo's funeral <p align=left>Column:1534</p>and the recent ten-point agreement between Chen Shui-bian and James Soong, which Mr Leong and Mr Ravindran referred&nbsp;to, the situation is still tense and delicate, and&nbsp;we should not underestimate how tense and delicate the situation is.&nbsp; The US said recently that it is opposed to China's enactment of an anti-secession law even before the actual legislation has come out.&nbsp; China protested the recent joint statement by the US and Japan on the Taiwan Straits.&nbsp; But in the end, the key to peaceful cross-straits relations is good US-China relations.&nbsp; We hope that all sides will exercise restraint in their actions so as to preserve the peace and stability across the straits which is so important to all of us in the region.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee asked about our relations with Taiwan.&nbsp; Let me say that we have a one China policy and we have no official relations with Taiwan, but we have good relations with Taiwan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>India</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let&nbsp;me turn to India, the other giant re-emerging, mentioned by Mr Ravindran and Ms Irene Ng.&nbsp; In the early 90s, when Prime Minister Narasimha Rao&nbsp;took India on a new course of development, we decided to position ourselves strategically for that new India, knowing full well that it is a process which will be long and winding.&nbsp; This morning I read the op-ed piece written by the Indian Finance Minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, whom I have known for many years.&nbsp; He had just given a budget which was very well received by the Bombay Stock Market in which he talked about how, despite a bad monsoon last year, India achieved a growth rate of close to 7% and how India is now set on a new path to economic growth into the future.&nbsp; He said India has paid&nbsp;the fixed cost of democracy and so in the early years had a low growth rate, between 3% and 4%, but now they are set&nbsp;on a much faster growth path.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1535 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our links with India are excellent, almost a love affair.&nbsp; And regardless of the administration, it is likely that in a few months we will conclude the comprehensive economic cooperation, which is our FTA with India and that would put our bilateral relationship on a higher plane.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also actively involved in strengthening India's links to ASEAN.&nbsp; You know, our High Commissioner, See Chak Mun, when he was posted to New Delhi, I told him, \"Chak Mun, you are going to have a busy time.\"&nbsp; He smiled.&nbsp; That&nbsp;used to be quite a sedate posting&nbsp;and&nbsp;a hardship posting.&nbsp; Today it is a different Delhi and when I met Ambassador See recently, he said, \"Boy, there is a&nbsp;constant procession of visits&nbsp;of political and business leaders in both directions.\"&nbsp; And I thought that expressed in a graphic way the state of bilateral relations today.<br></p><p><I>Reaching out to new partners</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With globalisation, opportunities once too remote are now open to us.&nbsp; Since the change in our policy towards the Middle East less than two years ago, our links to that part of the world have grown rapidly.&nbsp; As Mr Hawazi Daipi said, the Middle East is a significant opportunity for our businessmen.&nbsp; But it is a complex region and we need to build up our knowledge of it.&nbsp; There are still many things which we do not understand and the risks should not be underestimated.&nbsp; We have got to watch political and economic developments carefully.&nbsp; Led by the Gulf States, many countries in the Middle East are now experimenting with economic liberalisation and some are looking towards Asia.&nbsp; More than most Singaporeans realise, we are often held up as an economic model for them to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp; My old Harvard Business School Professor Richard Vietor told me last year that whenever he conducts courses in the Middle East, they would insist that the<p align=left>Column:1536</p> Singapore case&nbsp;be included.&nbsp; There are many things that we have&nbsp;to do to advance our interests in the Middle East.&nbsp; SM Goh Chok Tong's visits to Iran, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have opened new doors for us.&nbsp; The Asia-Middle East Dialogue (AMED) which SM Goh initiated, builds another bridge between the Middle East and our part of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hawazi Daipi asked for my assessment of peace prospects in the Middle East.&nbsp; Well, although the clouds have by no means dispersed, we are beginning to see some silver linings.&nbsp; The outcome of the elections in Iraq was better than expected.&nbsp; There was a good turnout in spite of terror attacks and brutal intimidation by the insurgents.&nbsp; Some Sunni groups, which had earlier boycotted the elections, are now thinking of joining the process to draw up a new constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also progress in Palestine, in the Israel-Palestinian peace process.&nbsp; The recent summit in Sharm el-Sheikh between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Abu Mazen was an important step forward.&nbsp; A ceasefire is now in place, it is still very delicate and both sides have taken small steps to rebuild trust and confidence.&nbsp; But we could be sure that there are trouble makers who want to sabotage the peace process.&nbsp; These are early days, and many things could still go wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Iran's nuclear issue, Teheran has agreed to suspend its uranium enrichment activities temporarily while its talks with the UK, France and Germany continue.&nbsp; Well, we&nbsp;hope that the talks will be successful.&nbsp; Iran needs to cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and restore international confidence.&nbsp; The recent report of a <I>fatwa</I> by Grand Ayatollah Khamenei against Iran developing nuclear weapons could be significant.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1537 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farther away, developments in South America&nbsp;bear watching.&nbsp; China has recently established strategic partnerships with Brazil and Argentina, which will involve investments of billions of dollars in infrastructure.&nbsp; In the coming years, trade between South America and Asia will grow and we should position Singapore for some of that flow.&nbsp; The FTAs we are discussing with Chile and Peru should help us.&nbsp; Our shipyards have become major players in Brazil's offshore oil industry and much of the frozen chicken meat in our markets now comes from Brazil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Global governance</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a small country, we have a strong interest in promoting good global governance based on clear rules and the equality of nations.&nbsp; The proper functioning of international organisations like the UN and the WTO is very important to us.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason, we support the reform of the UN and the early conclusion of the Doha Development Agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that UNESCO is much better run, we have decided to rejoin it, first as an observer and later, in two or three years' time, as a full member.&nbsp; I am happy to report that the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) has recently decided to establish a regional facility in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Seizing opportunities</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In this new world, being small and&nbsp;being a city state is no longer such a great disadvantage.&nbsp; In fact, there are many advantages because we are spry and quick to exploit opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a chance now to grow our links in all directions and enlarge our security and economic space.&nbsp; We do not know how long this period of history favourable to us will last.&nbsp; In the meantime, we should work hard and quickly to build new structures which keep the spaces open to our people.&nbsp; This is the reason why Singapore plays such an active role in <p align=left>Column:1538 </p>regional and international organisations.&nbsp; Our FTAs and other bilateral and regional arrangements also&nbsp;help us to&nbsp;preserve these spaces and to open new ones.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very important for our companies and for individual Singaporeans to follow up to exploit these new spaces.&nbsp; Foreign policy is a means, not an end in itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our job in the Foreign Ministry is to help create a framework and environment&nbsp;that enables our entrepreneurs to fan out, seize opportunities and take calculated risks.&nbsp;

While we have heard the exposition of how these organisations help us in this Chamber today, I think many in the community might still find it a little abstruse and wonder just how some of these organisations can help us.&nbsp; Is the Commonwealth, for example, still relevant to us?&nbsp; Does it actually help in our relations with, say, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand, which are Commonwealth countries in the region?&nbsp;

Obviously, they think it is very important.&nbsp; How does&nbsp;our membership in these organisations&nbsp;help Singapore?&nbsp; For example, how are we faring in terms of our interests in air traffic control, communications, our place in international law, global warming and air traffic growth?&nbsp;

Singapore continues to play a key role in International Organisations such as the UN. We believe that the UN is an important component of the international system, upholding the rule of international law and safeguarding the rights of small and large states alike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore remains active in various international organisations and forums, such as in the UN, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and World Trade Organisation (WTO).&nbsp; In the case of ICAO, Singapore has been re-elected to the Council in 2004, and that is its highest decision making body. In telecommunications, the InfoComm Development Authority (IDA) represents Singapore at key meetings of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the principal international organi<p align=left>Column:1544 </p>sation dealing with telecommunication issues.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore also chairs the UN working group that is working on a treaty to harmonise laws relating to contracts entered into by electronic means.&nbsp; Such a treaty will promote international trade by removing uncertainty on the legal aspects of matters such as Internet sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On environmental issues, Singapore supports UN initiatives like the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which we are party to since 1997.&nbsp; Although Singapore has yet to accede to the Kyoto Protocol, we are committed to becoming more carbon efficient.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chay asked how the UN and other international organisations view Singapore's contribution in international affairs.&nbsp; In fact, whenever I go round visiting other countries and meeting foreign dignitaries, one thing that clearly comes out in conversation is that they always ask about Prof. Tommy Koh, and they are reminded about his contributions at the UN and also at the Law of the Sea Conference, and many other officers like Kishore Mahbubani and&nbsp;Prof. Jayakumar.&nbsp; They&nbsp;all have made their mark when it comes to serving at International Organisations.&nbsp; I believe that these International Organisations&nbsp;view our role positively.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do what we can within our resource constraints.&nbsp; Our guiding principle continues to be to focus efforts in areas where we believe we can make a meaningful contribution.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our recent contribution to the tsunami-related humanitarian efforts is one good example.&nbsp; We were the first to arrive at the affected areas to provide immediate relief and to open up the transport routes before the bulk of international assistance arrived.&nbsp; We worked closely with the UN specialised agencies, and offered them the use of our <p align=left>Column:1545 </p>air and naval bases as well as military assets on the ground.&nbsp; Various UN officials, including the Secretary General, Mr Kofi Annan, and the Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, Jan Egeland, have expressed appreciation for our efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, in a recent letter to the Prime Minister to thank Singapore for its contributions, the Secretary General wrote, and I quote:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Your Government responded&nbsp; ... magnificently, and provided the critical support required to sustain the United Nation's effort on the ground, particularly in terms of logistics, civil-military liaison and coordination.\"</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

Singapore's cooperation with the World Health Organisation is another example of our positive relations with key International Organisations.&nbsp; Our effective handling of the SARS crisis in year 2003 have been noted and praised by various WHO officials.&nbsp; Last year, MOH collaborated with the WHO to host an international seminar on the public management of communicable diseases.&nbsp; That Singapore was chosen as a partner and venue for the seminar speaks for itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;we, as an open economy, are heavily dependent on international trade. &nbsp;Singapore strongly supports an open rules-based multilateral trading system under the WTO.&nbsp; Our FTAs complement and strengthen the multilateral trade liberalisation process and do not contradict the WTO regime since they are WTO-consistent and WTO-plus.&nbsp; We see a dense network of intra-regional and cross-regional FTAs as facilitating free trade both at the regional and global levels.&nbsp; It provides better immediate market access and, we believe, improves the dynamics at the WTO towards concluding the Doha <p align=left>Column:1546 </p>Round by injecting a greater sense of urgency into the negotiations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our FTAs serve to expand our economic as well as political links.&nbsp; As a small country in Southeast Asia, our network of global FTAs helps put us on the world map.&nbsp; Our FTAs with the US, Japan, Korea, EFTA, Australia, NZ and Jordan are testimony to this fact.&nbsp; We want to ensure that Singapore is well plugged into the world of trade, finance, tax, transport and telecommunications.&nbsp; We will continue to forge these links, spanning the world.&nbsp; Our FTAs have created greater access to major and emerging markets for our companies. Companies anchored in Singapore can and should tap into this extensive network of global connections.&nbsp; This will reinforce our position as a strategic hub for business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major trends of this century, I think, as we all know, is regionalism. The Americas are coalescing with NAFTA and the FTAA as the core while Europe is engaged in an unprecedented experiment of pooling sovereignties. East Asia is also moving towards regionalism, although in a looser and less institutionalised form, as patterns of trade, investment, production decisions and a web of FTAs slowly but, inevitably, bring the region together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic question we face is defining the nature of East Asian regionalism. We believe that it should be inclusive, forward-looking, adapting to and co-opting new developments in its midst, not least of which is India's rise. It is in Singapore's and ASEAN's interest to encourage deeper engagement of all the major powers. An outward-looking and open East Asian regionalism will help secure Singapore's economic as well as political future for the long-term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question raised by Dr Warren Lee on how we can take advantage of goodwill following tsunami and inter-regional cooperation,&nbsp;I think&nbsp;Members&nbsp;are<p align=left>Column:1547 </p> aware of the reply I gave on 18th February in Parliament to MP Mdm Halimah Yacob's question on assistance to Aceh. Work is in progress.&nbsp; We&nbsp;have spoken about the relief efforts of the SAF and&nbsp;non-Government organisations, such as the Red Cross Society (SRCS) - apart from Indonesia, the SRCS has also sent relief missions to other tsunami-affected areas. As these countries begin to enter into a reconstruction phase, the Red Cross Society now leads a committee comprising representatives from various NGOs to ensure that the funds collected from the public are properly disbursed for the reconstruction projects. Among the planned projects are the rebuilding of schools, clinics and hospitals.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we begin to implement the reconstruction projects for Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Maldives, Singapore will continue to work closely with these countries.&nbsp; I am confident that, through this close interaction, we will strengthen our warm relations with these countries and foster new opportunities for cooperation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of properties which we lease or buy overseas, we thank Prof. Ivan for&nbsp;that interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;We take various factors into account in our decision to lease or buy overseas properties. When good opportunities come by, we must be prepared to acquire such properties, particularly in countries where we have significant interests. For example, our Official Residence in London, which we at first rented&nbsp;from 1968, but was bought over recently at below valuation. Members may also like to know that this residence also happens to be the former residence of Earl Mountbatten. So it has also historical significance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, our preference&nbsp;is to lease when we set up a new overseas mission as time is needed to assess our long-term requirements. However, when our long-term requirements have been established, <p align=left>Column:1548</p>our preference is to own them, where local conditions permit, because it gives us greater flexibility.&nbsp; MFA currently owns a total of 135 properties in 23 countries.&nbsp; But remember&nbsp;we have relations with more than 160 countries all over the world.&nbsp; In addition, it leases 117 properties in these countries.&nbsp; Our development cashflow is in the region of S$40 million per annum between FY 03 and FY 05 and comprises about 35% for purchases and 65% for development and upgrading of existing properties.&nbsp; Currently, 19 of our embassies and consulates are housed in owned properties while the remaining 18 are housed in leased premises. In FY 05, MFA intends to acquire&nbsp;three properties to house&nbsp;two embassies and&nbsp;one consulate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sale of overseas properties is governed by guidelines issued by, of course, MOF to ensure that the disposals do not constitute a draw on past Government reserves. &nbsp;The purchase of overseas properties is also governed by guidelines issued by MOF to ensure that purchases are at fair market value.&nbsp; There are also procedures to ensure that leases are contracted at fair market rent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, in the last&nbsp;five years, the total sale proceeds accruing from the sale of overseas properties was S$36.8 million, and it exceeded the total acquisition cost of S$12.5 million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, diplomacy and foreign relations are more than just a matter of good bargains, good opportunities for better relations all round is our mission.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Most Singaporeans are cultured at the first level.&nbsp; As long as you enjoy good food, you are cultured at the \"input\" level.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second level of being cultured is at the \"responsive\" level.&nbsp; In the past years, we have seen an increasing number of visitors to our museums, book fairs, arts festivals and exhibitions like the bountiful sculptures of Botero, and the audiences to our concerts, operas, performances and musicals and we know that the Broadway classic \"The Sound of Music\" is coming to Singapore next month.&nbsp; Thus, Singaporeans and visitors are responding to the artistic talents and avenues found in or introduced to Singapore.&nbsp; I am glad that the vision, policies and strategies of MICA to promote the arts for everyone and arts at everywhere have borne fruits.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the opening of the Esplanade in 2002, the new National Library this year and the launch of the Creative Town Initiative, I am confident that we are moving towards the third level of being<p align=left>Column:1551 </p> cultured at the \"proactive participation level\", where Singaporeans play an active role in using their creativity and interests in the arts to contribute to the community and society as a whole.&nbsp; Thus, under Media 21 plans, I would like to ask the Minister on what the Government is doing to encourage, recognise and deploy the creative talents and energies of our people for community benefit and development under the Creative Town Initiative.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MICA is also developing the creative industry.&nbsp; I would like to know whether the creative industry would benefit the community and society at large.&nbsp; If&nbsp;so, how are these benefits transmitted to ordinary Singaporeans?&nbsp; Besides, what are the additional investments that the Government would be making to develop our cultural capital and to strengthen Singaporeans' interest and knowledge in our arts and cultural heritage?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, a museum cannot be a serious player in arts and culture if it does not have sufficient acquisition money.&nbsp; For example, the Singapore Art Museum would need about $3 million to buy the Tan Swie Hian&nbsp;Collection, but it could not do so because it has not the budget for it.&nbsp;

It is not that we do not have the literary talents.&nbsp; We have teenage poets who have won world-wide awards in the UK,<p align=left>Column:1553</p> and I believe one reason why the world knows so much about UK, Canadian, American and Australian&nbsp;literature is because their writers are promoted by their countries.&nbsp;

I think this is a very interesting development.&nbsp; I have seen some examples in other countries.&nbsp; For example, in Paris, there was a former train station that was converted into a museum which is of&nbsp;world-class standard.&nbsp; The Musee d'Orsay is now recognised as one of the most interesting places to visit in Paris.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1554 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some of Singapore's greatest assets, eg, our diverse culture, rich heritage and delicious food, are often taken for granted.&nbsp;

Sir, the Esplanade, and subsequently all the other arts venues, have done a wonderful job in promoting the arts in Singapore.&nbsp; We have had the good fortune to enjoy many globally popular performances, such as \"Singing in the Rain\", \"Mamma Mia\", world famous orchestras, as well as blockbuster exhibitions, such as \"Ju Min\" and \"Botero\" and so on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, however, I am a simple man.&nbsp; I wonder whether all these world-renowned performances and exhibitions can be appreciated by the population at large.&nbsp; What attempts, if any at all,&nbsp;were and would be made to enhance the connection with the average Singaporean?&nbsp; I am concerned that when the artistic venues, such as the Esplanade, bring in internationally-renowned performances, whether there are any audits done on assessing the effects on the larger community.&nbsp; I would also ask if the agencies that bring in such groups can plan an interaction and appreciation programme for the heartlanders.&nbsp; Such interaction could perhaps be worked<p align=left>Column:1555 </p> through with the CDCs or the other grassroots organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, given that we have&nbsp;a rich cultural heritage, arts groups can play a constructive role in raising the awareness about cultural diversity in Singapore.&nbsp; For example, the Singapore Kairalee Kala Nilayam could perform for the Chinese High School, so that the SAP school students could learn about Malayalam art and culture.&nbsp; Similarly, Malay groups can perform for the other races, etc.&nbsp; However, some provision needs to be in place for the successful promotion of arts at the community level.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, performance venues must be readily available and affordable.&nbsp; For example, I have heard from the ground that such venues in Singapore are usually fully booked long in advance.&nbsp; Moreover, to book a venue, there is a need to place a deposit and, in the case of venues booked through NAC, full payment needs to be made two weeks in advance.&nbsp; Similarly, medium-sized venues, with seating capacity of between 400 and 500, are scarce.&nbsp; If an arts group wants to put together a performance, they would have to compete for the same venues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, next, I would like to ask for more smaller and affordable venues to be provided for arts groups to showcase their talents.&nbsp; For example, in Marine Parade, the Necessary Stage is partnering the Marine Parade Community Library.&nbsp; This provides a focus point for arts group development and performances.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that we expand on such partnerships in other locations around Singapore.&nbsp; In effect, this will bring the arts groups to the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, appreciation of the arts can only be nurtured gradually and progressively.&nbsp; So, in order to do so, in the beginning, I suggest that all these programmes must be&nbsp;simple, friendly and<p align=left>Column:1556 </p> easily appreciated by the local folks.&nbsp; This will allow more Singaporeans to appreciate arts better.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Sir, the Creative Town Initiative was initiated by MICA recently.&nbsp;

It needs the support of our heartlanders.&nbsp; We have to promote arts in the HDB estates.&nbsp; We should introduce arts to our young so that they grow up loving arts.&nbsp; This is especially so for our museums.&nbsp; They are great places to visit.&nbsp; They have improved in practically all aspects, eg, physical environment, display, content, activities and service.&nbsp; I applaud our museums.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But how do we get Singaporeans to visit them and enjoy them?&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have to create the awareness.&nbsp; But awareness is not enough.&nbsp; Many people visit the&nbsp;museums only to take a quick walk-through, a quick glance at the exhibits and to declare they had visited.&nbsp; They have to appreciate what they see.&nbsp; I believe that if visitors already know something about what they are going to see, they will take time to look, read the<p align=left>Column:1557 </p> explanation and enjoy the exhibits.&nbsp; May I therefore suggest to MICA&nbsp;and NHB or the museums to organise talks in the heartlands for our grassroots organisations.&nbsp; They could then arrange for residents to tour the museums.&nbsp; In this way, residents will find the museums more interesting.&nbsp; They can bring their children and share the information with them.&nbsp; The interest shown by the parents will rub off on the children.&nbsp; It will strengthen family bonding, especially the children's respect for their parents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I also ask the Minister when the museum next to the former National Library will reopen to the public?&nbsp; I hope that it will retain the name \"National Museum\".&nbsp; This name has a certain ring and familiarity.&nbsp; Singaporeans will still remember fondly of the former museum.&nbsp; The name has been deeply etched on the minds of Singaporeans, and is one that they can associate with.&nbsp;

Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</B> Mr Chairman, it is said that the 21st century will be the century of cities as, for the first time in history, over 50% of the world will live in cities.&nbsp; In Singapore, of course, we are a city-state.&nbsp; So, naturally, the percentage is much higher.&nbsp; The challenge in many countries, including Singapore, is to make cities more desirable places to live in.&nbsp; On the one hand, we must recreate elements of the community or <I>kampong</I> spirit, a sense of place and belonging, a degree of collective security and continuity.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, it is also necessary to achieve urban buzz to connect and maximise the possibilities of trade, of meeting people, absorbing a diversity of lifestyles and cultures and, of course, of just having plain fun.&nbsp; We must have civic creativity and an urbane society, all <p align=left>Column:1558 </p>working for the common good.&nbsp; Only recently has it been recognised that the creative industries can be one of the key drivers of the modern economy, representing as much as an average of 4-5% of GDP in developed economies.&nbsp; In a city like London, for example, nearly 700,000 people work in the creative industries, which comprise 15% of London's economy.&nbsp; It nearly represents 20% of the workforce and has a turnover of between 25&nbsp;-&nbsp;30 billion pounds.&nbsp; Over 11,000 companies are classified as being cultural industry companies.&nbsp; I believe that London is really a model to look at.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, may&nbsp;I first digress and congratulate the Minister and the Ministry for being involved in the London project to showcase Singapore's creative talents this year in London.&nbsp; I hope that this will bring excellent results of cooperation with London companies and Singapore companies and artists, so that we can grow our creative industries further.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there must be a greater awareness, in that the creative sector must be recognised as an integrated sector.&nbsp; Theatre, visual arts, music or fashion, film-making, etc, they are all now interconnected.&nbsp; There is great convergence and symbiosis among the creative arts that never existed before.&nbsp; Sir, this means that there is an urgent need to create the conditions necessary, not just the development of our creative industries for the sake of economic growth, but also for the sake of our social growth and for a more gracious and interconnected society.&nbsp; It is in this context that I would like to ask the Minister whether there are plans to implement one of the Economic Review Committee's key recommendations, ie,&nbsp;developing the Creative Town Initiative.&nbsp; I rather prefer to call it Creative Community Initiative or Creative Communities Initiative, but that is only by the way.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, may I ask the Minister, as with Mr Charles Chong, whether the initiative<p align=left>Column:1559</p> would see the light of day soon?&nbsp; Would there be funds to help launch and promote projects that are within the creative industries as without?</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it is always said that we should promote social entrepreneurship that would connect individuals, enterprises and community groups to enhance community bonding.&nbsp; How does MICA see its role in promoting this social entrepreneurship?&nbsp; What sort of projects would it approve?&nbsp; For example, would there be funds available to help grassroots organisations which have developed projects, such as a web portal, to link businesses, grassroots organisations, schools, grassroots leaders and residents to each other?&nbsp; We started a project of this type in Woodlands, and I hope that the Minister&nbsp;will consider giving us money to&nbsp;maintain such a site.&nbsp; Sir, I declare my interest at this point.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this context, Sir, I also hope that the Minister and his policy makers would be open-minded and supportive of all forms of creativity.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">2.15 pm</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Members for their comments and support for MICA's arts and heritage programmes.&nbsp; They have asked very thoughtful questions about what MICA is doing to develop the arts and to nurture a creative community.&nbsp; Before I answer these questions, let me put MICA's arts and heritage mission in perspective&nbsp;in the context of what we are ultimately trying to achieve as a nation and, at the same time, also to sketch a broad picture of the strategy that we need to achieve our mission.&nbsp; As the Prime Minister has set out during the debate on the President's Address, what we are working for is a better life for all, not just in&nbsp;economic terms alone, but also&nbsp;in having a nation <p align=left>Column:1564 </p>\"where everyone belongs, where each person has a role to play, and where all can live in dignity\".<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last decade, Singapore's sustained&nbsp;investments in the arts, heritage and cultural development have enhanced the quality of life for Singaporeans, young and old.&nbsp; Singapore has also become a more attractive city&nbsp;for international talents, and for business and leisure visitors alike.&nbsp; We have come a long way but we cannot claim to have arrived.&nbsp; We must continue to work on strengthening and enhancing our cultural capital to support economic development and distinctiveness as a global city.&nbsp; The competition is growing and it is not just about achieving economic competitive advantage.&nbsp; More importantly, we must continue to build a cohesive and resilient society firmly anchored to our history, our heritage and our shared values,&nbsp;a Singapore where Singaporeans are actively engaged in the community and able to express their creative energies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, more and more Singaporeans are taking part in arts, heritage and cultural activities.&nbsp; Last year, more than 700,000 people visited our museums, of which two-thirds are Singapore residents.&nbsp; This is more than twice the number 10 years ago.&nbsp; Our arts and cultural events also attracted a growing audience. Many Singaporeans find these events entertaining, meaningful and stimulating. For example, last year, the Singapore Arts Festival attracted a record high of 916,000 people. Also, last year, about 5.8 million people visited the Esplanade, mostly Singaporeans.&nbsp; Many are justifiably proud of the Esplanade, not just for its unique architecture but also for the diversity&nbsp;of its programmes which have contributed to the vibrancy of the arts scene in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp; All this clearly indicates that more and more Singaporeans are showing an interest in \"food for the soul\".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1565 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are just some of the results of the programmes we have put in place over the years.&nbsp; All these efforts will continue.&nbsp; We are also setting up our first specialised Arts School, which I will say more about later.&nbsp; Beyond the Arts School, we will continue to build up the capacity of Singaporeans for lifelong learning in a globalised world.&nbsp; Here, the National Library Board&nbsp;will have a key role which the Senior Minister of State&nbsp;will explain later, when addressing other Members' questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, we will enhance our efforts to reach out to the people to deepen their appreciation and enjoyment of the arts.&nbsp; We will also encourage and support creative activities at the community level.&nbsp; This will be done in parallel with our effort to develop the creative industries and to generate new economic opportunities for Singaporeans.&nbsp; I will elaborate on this later.&nbsp; For our arts and creativity works&nbsp;to inspire and reach new heights, we must be inclusive and we must engage all Singaporeans.&nbsp; Sir, we have the potential and we have a rich heritage to work from.&nbsp; MICA will help Singaporeans to leverage on the arts and culture as we move into the&nbsp;next chapter of the Singapore story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in terms of arts infrastructure, MICA recently announced our plans to transform the City Hall and Supreme Court Building into a world-class art gallery, as several Members have noted.&nbsp; This is a major project which highlights the Government's support&nbsp;for the arts.&nbsp; Just as the Esplanade has had a great impact on the performing arts scene, this new art gallery will also contribute to an even more vibrant visual arts scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another strategic thrust by MICA is to help our more successful artists and arts companies gain recognition abroad.&nbsp; Indeed Singapore's efforts in globalisation must include our artists and our artistic<p align=left>Column:1566 </p> community. &nbsp;Last year, the&nbsp;National Arts Council&nbsp;supported 45 artists and groups as they participated in major arts events around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, we are making a bigger mark on the international stage, through the on-going inaugural Singapore Season in London.&nbsp; Beyond London, the Singapore Season model will be used to showcase our talents and creativity to&nbsp;other major cities. In 2006, the Singapore Biennale will be launched and will connect Singapore to the international arts circuit, providing international and local artists opportunities for cross cultural exchanges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Sir, I have given a broad outline of MICA's direction to develop the arts and heritage, nurture creativity, support life-long learning and present our arts and creativity to the world.&nbsp; MICA will actively pursue&nbsp;these programmes, projects and initiatives to achieve our vision of a creative people, a gracious community and a connected Singapore. Development and deployment of our cultural capital will result in a vibrant creative economy with more opportunities for our people. Sir, I will now proceed to address the issues raised by hon. Members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Mr Seng Han Thong, Prof. Chin Tet Yung, Mr Charles Chong and Dr Ong Seh Hong&nbsp;sought information on MICA's effort to promote creativity at the community level.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform this House that we will launch a new initiative to support and nurture creativity among our people at the community level. We call this new initiative \"Creative Community Singapore\". The working title reflected in our Addendum to the President's Address was \"Creative Town Initiative\". We have decided that the title \"Creative Community Singapore\" better describes the mission of this initiative.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creative Community Singapore will be launched in the second quarter of this year.&nbsp; MICA will allocate $10 million over three years, between financial years 2005&nbsp;<p align=left>Column:1567 </p>and 2007 to support Creative Community Singapore.&nbsp; The objective is to provide opportunities for Singaporeans from all walks of life to express their creativity and deploy their creative energy for community benefit.&nbsp; Creative Community Singapore's aim is to build a creative and connected community where arts, culture, business and technology converge to empower and to engage individuals.&nbsp; Creativity Community Singapore will provide a variety of support, including funding to implement creative ideas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creative Community Singapore is steered by a partnership comprising members from the public, private and the people sector. The Community Development Councils (CDCs) have also taken a keen interest in Creative Community Singapore.&nbsp; The Community Development Councils are an effective outreach channel to engage and to meet the needs and expectations of the community. We are therefore very happy that all five Community Development Councils are part of the Creative Community Singapore partnership.&nbsp; They are helping us to ensure that this programme will better meet&nbsp;the needs of their residents.</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By supporting the realisation of creative ideas for the benefit of the community, Creative Community Singapore aims to touch more than 50,000 Singaporeans over the project period of three years. It will support the growth of the creative industry by recognising and enhancing the creative capabilities and skills of at least 5,000 Singaporeans.&nbsp; It will also support the creation of jobs and encourage business start-ups in creative areas.&nbsp; More importantly, Creative Community Singapore will instil confidence in Singaporeans to test out their creative ideas.&nbsp; We want to show that anyone, a 16-year old teenager, a retiree seeking to jazz up his retirement, a professional looking to a career switch, or<p align=left>Column:1568 </p> a group of youth activists wanting to do something for the benefit of the community, they could have the opportunities to initiate and start projects which will benefit the community.&nbsp; Creative Community Singapore aims to inspire the community by encouraging social entrepreneurialship and showcasing how creativity could be beneficial and applicable to all.&nbsp; In addition, projects drawing inspiration from our home-grown creative capability, our culture and our heritage will certainly strengthen community bonding, national pride and also our sense of identity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To answer Mr Charles Chong, MICA has already tested out the Creative Community Singapore concept on a small scale last year.&nbsp; We have attracted very encouraging response of 36 project proposals.&nbsp; 14 proposals were vetted.&nbsp; After vetting, 14 proposals were supported by the partnership and this first set of projects will be launched over the coming year.&nbsp; They will involve more than 15,000 people and provide training and skill enhancement to more than 1,000 participants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me briefly describe some of these projects.&nbsp; Time does not permit me to cover all 14 of them.&nbsp; \"Jam Series\" is an idea proposed by a non-profit group of youth activists barely out of their teens.&nbsp; This group is called \"Arts for Us All\".&nbsp; This project will comprise a series of basking events, which address the point about high art and low art made by Prof. Chin.&nbsp; This basking event would be held in different parts of Singapore which aims to showcase our local musicians and talent and, at the same time, raise funds for charity and community work.&nbsp; The next one is \"Saturday@Clementi Central\".&nbsp; This is a Southwest CDC project, envisaging a monthly performance and arts bazaar to showcase local musical talent&nbsp;and providing budding entrepreneurs with opportunity to sell their own creative products.&nbsp;&nbsp; A third project is<p align=left>Column:1569 </p> the \"National Youth Poetry Slam Competition\" organised by a company called \"Wordforward Limited\", a non-profit organisation, with a passion for this increasingly popular new literary art form, where people compete on writing and performing poetry.&nbsp; The competition aims to work with schools involving 99 youths and to reach out to an audience of about 12,000-15,000 students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Creative Community Singapore&nbsp;initiative also recognises the multitude of ways in which Singaporeans connect and form communities and would provide support for good creative ideas including those in cyberspace.&nbsp; An example of a cyberspace project that is supported is the Dream Factory.&nbsp; Dream Factory is an integrated web portal for youth to submit their creative ideas or their dreams in the creative industry and to receive guidance and mentorship to realise these dreams.&nbsp; Another example is Age-Invaders, a project that aims to combine technology and new media art into an interactive game to encourage young and old to play together in this interactive game.&nbsp; Such projects illustrate the multi-faceted ways in which Creative Community Singapore will reach out to the people in our heartlands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So with the public launch of Creative Community Singapore&nbsp;in the second quarter of this year, we expect to see many more ideas and proposals to expose Singaporeans to the opportunities and the possibilities in the creative industry.&nbsp; Online projects, such as the one mentioned by Prof. Chin in his constituency, will certainly be considered for co-branding and even co-funding.&nbsp; I would urge Prof. Chin to get his community leaders to put up a proposal for the partnership to consider in due course.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, Ms Irene Ng asked important questions about what needs to be done to create a museum-going, <p align=left>Column:1570 </p>theatre-going and arts-loving people.&nbsp; Let me assure this House that as the Government continues to invest in our arts and heritage infrastructure, we would place equal importance on ensuring that Singaporeans could enjoy our arts,&nbsp;culture and heritage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Ng asked about the acquisition of local and regional artworks.&nbsp; The National Heritage Board has an acquisition budget which allows it to make selective purchases.&nbsp; She mentioned why is it that we do not have enough money to buy the collection from our foremost artist, Tan Swie Hian.&nbsp; The budget is there, but it is&nbsp;never enough.&nbsp; Funds for purchasing arts and heritage artifacts will never be enough and so it is up to the National Heritage Board to decide how they should deploy the budget.&nbsp; What I want to point out is that we do not rely on acquisitions alone to build up our national collection.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the National Heritage Board works closely with patrons, donors and sponsors to build up our art collection.&nbsp; For example, last year we received from the Liu Kang family a substantial donation of the late Liu Kang's artworks, valued at more than $18 million.&nbsp; We also received a donation of 150 artworks from Mr Lim Tze Ping and his patron, Mr Koh Seow Chuan. As a result of these and many other donations, as well as careful acquisitions over the years, we now have an art collection of about 6,500 artworks, mainly local and Southeast Asian artworks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, having a good collection of artworks is not enough.&nbsp; We need to be plugged into the international arena, to expose Singaporeans to the richness of the world's cultures.&nbsp; This is why we have established close cultural cooperation with countries such as Malaysia, India, China and even further away, Turkey.&nbsp; We will be signing a Memorandum of Understanding with a cultural organisation in the UK shortly.&nbsp; Such bilateral cultural cooperation enables <p align=left>Column:1571 </p>us, for example, to stage, the exhibition \"From the Lands of the Ottoman Sultans\", at the Asian Civilisations Museum last year.&nbsp; I understand it was a very well received exhibition and they were good quality artifacts from the Ottoman Empire period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have we succeeded to attract visitors to our museums?&nbsp; I am pleased to highlight that more and more Singaporeans are appreciating the arts, and visiting museums. Visitorship to our national museums has increased by 43% over the past decade from 1993 to 2003. In addition, last year, more than 750,000 people attended the Heritage Festival performances and educational programmes conducted by the National Heritage Board to showcase, highlight and promote our heritage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this trend is positive and encouraging.&nbsp; MICA will continue to support these outreach programmes for more Singaporeans to be appreciative of the arts, culture and heritage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Ms Ng that MICA should encourage more public projects to enhance Singaporeans' sense of ownership.&nbsp; MICA supported many arts projects regardless of whether they are initiated by the public sector, the Government or by the private sector.&nbsp; Good examples of public art are the Land Transport Authority's Art-In-Transit project along the entire North-East MRT Line and the Singapore Tourism Board's presentation of SingArt - A Brush with Lions - in the city areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAC encourages schools to engage artists to work with their students to paint murals for their schools or to brighten up the walls of neighbouring HDB apartment blocks.&nbsp; Increasingly, the corporate sector has been installing artworks in their buildings and offices to enhance their image, to increase the desirability of their premises and facilities and, of course, also to signal support for the arts.&nbsp; NHB has a <p align=left>Column:1572 </p>scheme to provide double tax deduction for donation and display of sculptures in public places and also to encourage more companies to come forward, the same double tax deduction will apply, if corporations are prepared to adopt public sculptures, which they did not donate in the first instance, but adopt these public sculptures and pay for the upkeep and maintenance of these public sculptures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To enhance Singaporeans' sense of ownership in our heritage institution, I just want to give one example&nbsp;from&nbsp;Asian Civilisations Museum at Empress Place.&nbsp; They have a scheme to encourage people to make a small donation of $200, upon which the donor's name would be inscribed on one of the bricks in the external walls of the museum.&nbsp; So if you go around the ACM at Empress Place today, you will see a lot of bricks with names engraved on them.&nbsp; These are in recognition of people who have made a small personal contribution.&nbsp; And I think these are ways which we will continue to engage our community, our people and build up a sense of ownership.&nbsp; I would ask the museums to continue to explore other avenues of enhancing this sense of ownership.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin asked what are we doing to strengthen national resilience through our heritage and our culture.&nbsp; Sir, our heritage and culture play a very important role in defining and deepening our national identity.&nbsp; Hence, the National Heritage Board adopts a multi-dimensional approach to deepen appreciation of our history, recall and remind us of the adversities that our forefathers had to overcome and also our successes.&nbsp; National Heritage Board's programmes also bring to life the practices and traditions derived from our diverse cultural heritage which characterise our society and underpin our shared values.&nbsp; Such programmes have strengthened our social resilience and sense of nationhood, as noted by Mr Zainudin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1573 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each year, NHB organises many activities to cater to different audiences.&nbsp;&nbsp; A good example is the HeritageFest, which I have just mentioned in response to Ms Irene Ng's remarks.&nbsp; This HeritageFest reached out to more than 600,000 people in July last year.&nbsp; During the course of the HeritageFest, Singaporeans had fun and became more aware of our heritage watching re-enactments of ethnic weddings, traditional wayang kulit, experiencing henna staining on their hands, and listening to old stories told in the old traditional street-corner storyteller sort of&nbsp; way.&nbsp; The event was held at various locations including shopping malls and bus interchanges.&nbsp; It attracted, as I said, 600,000 people from all walks of life.&nbsp; NHB is planning another HeritageFest this year which will build upon the experience of last year's event and will, hopefully, promote even greater awareness of our diversity in our culture and heritage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our museums are also presenting interesting exhibitions.&nbsp; We do&nbsp; conduct public talks and workshops to enable Singaporeans, especially children, to learn in a fun and interactive way.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

They were given the opportunity to display their paintings which&nbsp;got them even more excited.&nbsp; In the process, they had an opportunity to learn about Botero, why he has this characteristic style of presenting people and&nbsp;animals in an inflated way.&nbsp; They also learnt something about art.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1574 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin also asked whether technology is being used to bring heritage alive, make it even more compelling for the audience.&nbsp; I agree with him.&nbsp; I think we should do so, if we are not doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are, in fact, exploiting every available technology to ensure that&nbsp;our museums are attractive and compelling and are always up to date.&nbsp; For instance, the Asian Civilisations Museum at Empress Place uses talking heads to guide visitors around the museum.&nbsp; So it is just not voice over recorded tape.&nbsp; You can actually have a video presentation to explain the artefacts and&nbsp;the exhibits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Loh Meng See also raised the same point about how we are going to present our exhibits in the National Museum when it re-opens in 2006.&nbsp; Let me assure both Mr Zainudin and Mr Loh Meng See that we will use the state-of-the-art technology in the new National Museum and in all our other museums to give visitors a more meaningful, lively and educational experience each time they visit our museums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I fully agree with the comments made by Dr Ong Seh Hong and Dr Tan Boon Wan that Singapore's historical and cultural heritage, and our vibrant arts activities, should be appreciated by as many Singaporeans as possible, including our heartlanders.&nbsp; Besides the Heritage Festival which I had mentioned earlier, the National Heritage Board (NHB)&nbsp;organises other events to bring heritage to our heartlanders. If they do not go to the museums to experience our heritage, we bring our museums' contents to them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just&nbsp;like to mention two examples apart from the HeritageFest which I have cited earlier on.&nbsp; First, is the Heritage Express.&nbsp; In this project, NHB transformed two SMRT trains into \"moving museums\". These trains carried 102 information panels, brightly illustrated with good graphics and also notations,&nbsp;depicting different heritage&nbsp;themes.&nbsp; The routine journey of thousands of commuters from November 2003 to January 2004 became<p align=left>Column:1575 </p> imperceptibly a heritage experience.&nbsp; We were bringing parts of the museum into&nbsp;commuters' daily travel.&nbsp; Without making any effort, they could see something and, hopefully, learn something.&nbsp; We hope that through such engagements, we can interest some of them to make a trip to the&nbsp;museum to see more of the artefacts which might have stimulated&nbsp;their interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another example is the Heritage on the Move, an interactive travelling exhibition depicting the myths and legends of Singapore, which reached out to 160,000 people last year.&nbsp; NHB will continue to explore new ways of promoting our heritage to our people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAC also has an active Arts Education Programme, which reaches out to students in more than 350 schools each year.&nbsp; In addition, more than 300 schools participate in NHB's Museum School Membership Scheme, which encourages student group visits to the museums and offers them the opportunity to have informative conducted tours to these museums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each year, the NAC also organises a variety of events such as the Concerts in the Park series to bring the arts to a wider audience for free. Last year, more than 100,000 people attended such events.&nbsp; NAC also partners grassroots organisations to&nbsp;bring the arts to the man-in-the-street.&nbsp; For example, NAC and Central Singapore CDC co-organised a street festival called \"Arts@Tekka\".&nbsp;This is an arts belt street festival. I will ask NAC to explore further collaborations with CDCs and to make more efforts to bring the arts to our people in&nbsp;the heartlands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On making museum visits and arts performances more interesting and meaningful,&nbsp;I like to point out that&nbsp;we do&nbsp;offer customised packages catering to specific needs.&nbsp; This is to address the point made by Dr Tan Boon Wan.&nbsp; &nbsp;For <p align=left>Column:1576 </p>example,&nbsp;Community Clubs&nbsp;and Residents Committees have visited the Asian Civilisations Museum, as part of the special \"Harmony Tours\" organised with the People's Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge more grassroots advisers to organise such tours to the ACM or some of the other museums, so that they bring their grassroots organisations' members and also their residents to learn something about our heritage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Dr Tan Boon Wan suggested that we organise major outreach programmes to bring heartlanders to the museums, and to organise talks at the constituencies, before their museum visits. I will ask NHB to study Dr Tan's suggestion to organise pre-visit talks and to also explore other ways of attracting&nbsp;more people to our museums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the area of performing arts, I am pleased to note that more and more Singaporeans are showing keen interest.&nbsp; Dr Ong Seh Hong asked how many Singaporeans had actually benefited from the shows at the Esplanade.&nbsp; Last year, attendance at ticketed shows was more than 400,000, which means tickets were sold to more than 400,000 people to attend shows at the Esplanade.&nbsp; The Esplanade's survey showed that 77% of the audience at these shows were Singaporeans, and 46% of them were our heartlanders.&nbsp; So, obviously, our heartlanders have come to love the durian and are enjoying the fruit!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong also asked for more smaller arts venues.&nbsp; I think this is a valid request.&nbsp; This is something which MICA and&nbsp;the National Arts Council are looking into.&nbsp; Members have already seen how we have increased the availability of smaller art venues by converting none other than our own&nbsp;Old Parliament House into an Arts House with small venues for recitals, experimental plays and&nbsp;small exhibitions.&nbsp; We will continue to look around to see how we can have such additional small<p align=left>Column:1577 </p> venues for performances.&nbsp; I would like to inform the House that when the new National Library opens towards the end of this year, it will incorporate a new drama centre which will, in fact, provide a much needed venue for presentations that will attract a smaller audience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Dr Tan suggested retaining the name of the National Museum. I am pleased to inform the House that the redeveloped Singapore History Museum at Stamford Road will revert to its original name, \"National Museum of Singapore\", when it re-opens in 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Tan that the name \"National Museum\" is deeply embedded in the minds of Singaporeans, particularly the older generation.&nbsp; We certainly want the new and larger National Museum to have this link&nbsp;with the past.&nbsp; And many of the old exhibits that are in NHB's collection will certainly be presented in this new National Museum, but they will be presented in a more updated and contemporary context, so that it tells a more interesting story to our visitors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Loh Meng See asked&nbsp;what is MICA's strategy to promote the performing and visual arts.&nbsp; He also would like to know whether the arts reflect Singapore values, aspiration and heritage.&nbsp; Our strategy is to ensure that Singapore becomes an international hub, serving and benefiting from global economic network and business connections in the arts and, in the process, to offer many opportunities&nbsp;to our people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we stand at the crossroad of East and West,&nbsp;North and South, where many cultures and influences meet.&nbsp; We cannot close our minds to the changes and the developments that are taking place around us and beyond our immediate region.&nbsp; Yet, we must remain firmly rooted to our Asian heritage and culture. This is our unique proposition.&nbsp; This is what will distinguish us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1578 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our artists, whether performing or visual artists, must imbibe these values, even as they draw inspiration from external trends and developments.&nbsp; They must remain Singaporeans at heart so that their art will reflect our uniqueness and our&nbsp;national identity.&nbsp; They should tell the Singapore story through their artistic eyes and creative interpretation.&nbsp; Their commentaries and artistic insights should remain relevant to our ethos in order to contribute to our cultural capital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.00 pm&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, Singapore's arts scene has acquired a buzz and attracted international attention.&nbsp; For example, since its opening, the Esplanade has received many accolades internationally, as noted by Mr Loh.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh has also commented that the challenge</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>is to fill&nbsp; up the seats in both the theatre and the concert hall in the Esplanade.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform the House that for the period between April last year to January this year, the Esplanade achieved an occupancy rate of 90% for the concert hall, and 83% for the theatre.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is an extremely good occupancy rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many hotels would love to enjoy such an occupancy rate.&nbsp;Many shows enjoyed sold-out performances, such as \"Mamma Mia\" and, before that, \"Singing in the Rain\" and, more recently,&nbsp;the flautist Sir James&nbsp;Galway's Concert.&nbsp; Not all sold-out shows are international.&nbsp; I hasten to point out that local shows&nbsp;have also&nbsp;put on good sold-out performances at the Esplanade.&nbsp; For example, the local acapella group&nbsp;\"Budak Pantai\" and concerts by our most famous jazz musician,&nbsp;Mr Jeremy&nbsp;Monteiro,&nbsp;enjoyed sold-out performances at the Esplanade.&nbsp; Of course, there were also shows that did not go down well.&nbsp; These include both international and local shows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this is a reflection of the&nbsp;variety of arts programming and shows that are available to Singaporeans today.&nbsp; Singaporeans have a lot to choose from.&nbsp; They <p align=left>Column:1579 </p>can now choose from very popular performances to the more&nbsp;niche and experimental type. It also reflects the willingness of show presenters and promoters to stage new shows at the Esplanade and at our other performing arts venues, despite the risks of failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is a good sign that we have more entrepreneurial promoters and&nbsp;impresarios who are prepared to make an investment to stage and&nbsp;promote shows, notwithstanding the business risks that they are taking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to remember that the Esplanade is less than three years old.&nbsp; And, yet, it has already established a reputation as a place where big names in the international arts scene would like to perform.&nbsp;These big names are attracted here by the&nbsp;quality of the venue and the prestige associated with performing&nbsp;in the Esplanade in Singapore. The Esplanade has clearly contributed to a significant jump in the number of arts activities in Singapore, including both local and international shows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local performers have benefited from this new dynamism. Some are able to stand their ground on the international stage and have been invited to participate in many international arts festivals, eg, Jacintha, the very well-known singer and Wild Rice, the theatre company, were invited to perform at&nbsp;the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts, going along with several other Singaporean artists, performers,&nbsp;ceramic artist Iskandar Jalil, and writers.&nbsp; MICA is committed to help more of our accomplished artists to present their works on the international stage.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January this year,&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore sculptor, Miss Han Sai Por was a prize winner at the XIth Indian Triennale in New Delhi.&nbsp; Her works were presented along with works from 33 other countries.&nbsp;There were only 10 prizes awarded for <p align=left>Column:1580 </p>the Triennale with artists&nbsp;coming from 33 countries.&nbsp; She was one of the 10 prize winners.&nbsp; So NAC would play an active role in supporting and securing participation of Singapore artists in major arts exhibitions and arts festivals in China, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Korea, India and many other cities in the world.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, promoting Singapore arts and culture on the international stage will remain a key priority in our strategy for making Singapore a Global City for the Arts.&nbsp; Hence, MICA has launched a major cultural diplomacy initiative called the Singapore Season. This is to present Singapore as not just another business city, albeit&nbsp;a successful business city, but also a city for the arts to the international audience. The on-going Singapore Season, taking place in London, is the prototype of our cultural diplomacy.&nbsp; It is a concerted effort to showcase Singapore's artistic and cultural achievements.&nbsp; Prominent Singapore artists and arts companies are being featured in prestigious venues in London.&nbsp; Singapore Season brings together the Singapore Dance Theatre, Singapore Chinese Orchestra, Tang Quartet, theatre maestro Ong Keng Seng, painter/calligrapher Tan Swie Hian and many others for a six-week festival.&nbsp; In total, 250 artists and performers are involved in the Singapore Season.&nbsp; On top of the arts programme, we have added several other events designed to present Singapore in a holistic manner to enhance our image as a land of opportunity with an integrated work, live, play and learn environment. In the future, other key&nbsp;cities will be identified for the Singapore Season, where artists, with proven track record, will be our cultural ambassadors and will be given the opportunity to showcase their works. Sir, I believe that such exposure to international audience, at times a critical audience, will challenge our artists and performers to attain a higher level of artistic excellence and creativity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1581 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, MICA has several new projects to involve more Singaporeans and to broaden their interest and appreciation of the performing and visual arts.&nbsp;One new project is the Singapore Art Show, scheduled for September of this year.&nbsp; This is an art exhibition for both outstanding and up-and-coming local artists to showcase their latest works from various genres and media.&nbsp; We are also planning a River Arts Mart to provide a platform for creative and artistic talents to showcase and sell their best original arts and crafts. Next year, the inaugural Singapore Biennale, which is an international visual arts event, will enhance Singapore's presence in the regional and international arts scene.&nbsp; It will serve to plug Singapore into the international art circuit and enhance our status as a Global City for the Arts.&nbsp; NAC will continue to deliver an improved programming at our annual Festival of Arts and collaborate with partners to present new events in performing arts.&nbsp; I understand that, for this year's Arts Festival,&nbsp;NAC has made special arrangements for advance booking for&nbsp;their key performances, such as&nbsp;\"Swan Lake\" by the Royal Ballad of UK and&nbsp;a concert by the Philadelphia Orchestra.&nbsp; They had put out tickets&nbsp;for these events for advance sale. &nbsp;I have been told that tickets have been selling very well.&nbsp; In fact, for these two particular events, I have been informed that about&nbsp;60% of the tickets have already been pre-sold.&nbsp; So you can see that, obviously, there is a demand and there are many Singaporeans who are interested in the arts.&nbsp;They&nbsp;are prepared to pay to&nbsp;attend such&nbsp;performances and they will continue to support such performances.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to MICA's plan to transform the City&nbsp;Hall and Supreme Court&nbsp;Building into a major art gallery.&nbsp; I thank Mr Loh Meng See and Mr Zainudin for&nbsp;their support of this proposal. This gallery will reflect Singapore's artistic <p align=left>Column:1582</p>development and achievements. More importantly, it will enable us to showcase the works of artists who had made an impact on the development of art in our journey to nationhood. This new gallery will enable us to present our extensive collection of South East Asian art. We will also be able to devote significant space to host major international arts exhibitions to reinforce Singapore's position as an&nbsp;arts hub in the region.&nbsp; By locating the new art gallery in these two very important and historic buildings, we will also be making them more accessible to Singaporeans. Through such visits, many more people will better understand the historic events which took place in and around these buildings. Like the Musee D'Orsay in Paris, cited by Mr Zainudin, and the Esplanade, mentioned by Mr Loh, the new art gallery has great potential to be another inspiring cultural icon for Singapore.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Ivan Png questioned whether we need another museum.&nbsp; I agree with him that, in a cultural institution, it is not a question of building it&nbsp;and people will come.&nbsp; It is building, providing the facilities, having the infrastructure and making the effort to attract an audience.&nbsp; One cannot presume that people will turn up on their door step.&nbsp; As I explained earlier on, that philosophy underpins MICA's arts and heritage programme, that means, we have active outreach programmes to reach out to&nbsp;our people and the community to tell them about what is going on, to encourage them to come and visit, to interest them in the events that are taking place in our museum and&nbsp;various arts venues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe Prof. Ivan Png asked about the&nbsp;attendance in terms of per square metre of space, how does it compare with well-known major art museums elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to inform this House that if we take Prof. Png's measurement, actually we&nbsp;compare quite well.&nbsp; The Singapore Art Museum received 172,771 visitors in 2004, which means 115<p align=left>Column:1583 </p> visitors per square metre of exhibition space.&nbsp; This is higher than, say, the National Gallery of Australia which, by&nbsp;the same yardstick,&nbsp;had 53 visitors per square metre and the&nbsp;celebrated Musee D'Orsay in Paris&nbsp;had&nbsp;103&nbsp;visitors per square metre. Yes, of course, we are still below that of the&nbsp;New York Museum of Modern Art (MOMA).&nbsp; Before its closure for renovation, the MOMA in New York received &nbsp;152 visitors per square metre.&nbsp; That is the target that we should be shooting for.&nbsp; Here, I would like to point out that, although Prof. Png mentioned that visitorship to the Singapore Art Museum has been falling, I think this must be seen in perspective.&nbsp; It did come down some years.&nbsp; But the visitorship to the museum could become lumpy because of the ability and capacity to mount major international exhibitions.&nbsp; That is why from year to year, there can be a significant difference.&nbsp; I would expect, like this year, we have got an increase in visitorship compared to last year because we have mounted an exhibition of \"Ju Ming\". We also&nbsp;have got the ongoing Botero exhibition and&nbsp;Russell Wong, our celebrated Singapore photographer.&nbsp; So we have attracted a lot more visitors.&nbsp; So there is certain lumpiness in the visitorship.&nbsp; We have to look at it on a more long term basis.&nbsp; It also&nbsp;become a chicken and egg question.&nbsp; If you have a very small museum, you are not able to mount a major exhibition,&nbsp;then you are less likely to succeed in attracting a big crowd.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I like to point out that&nbsp;the Singapore Art Museum is in fact a very small museum&nbsp;- just 1,500 square metres of exhibition space, compared to&nbsp;the 17,500 square metres in the Musee D'Orsay in Paris.&nbsp; So it would naturally translate into a higher visitor per square metre ratio.&nbsp; I&nbsp;hasten to add that we should not be too complacent because we have a better visitor per square metre ratio compared to Musee D'Orsay.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact,&nbsp;because&nbsp;it is very small size, as I<p align=left>Column:1584</p> said earlier, there is a limit to the kind and scale of exhibition that the Singapore Art Museum can organise which will&nbsp;draw a higher attendance of both Singaporeans and also&nbsp;tourists.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This space limitation is, in fact,&nbsp;a key constraint and that is one reason&nbsp;why we need to develop better facilities, a newer but&nbsp;differentiated art gallery to serve our own people as well as to increase the buzz in the city.&nbsp; So the City Hall and Supreme Court Building offer us an unique opportunity to develop a new and major cultural institution. I have explained earlier on in response to Ms Irene Ng how we have built up a strong collection of Singapore,&nbsp;Southeast Asian and other artworks over the years.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>We have, as I said, 6,500 pieces of artworks in our collection.&nbsp; Hon. Members may be surprised to know that the Singapore Art Museum, with its 1,500 square metres, can only display about 200 pieces of artwork at any one time.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is going to take a long time for us to turn over our collection, as a result of which, much of our collection is not seen and cannot be appreciated by our people.&nbsp; On top of that, because of the space limitation, Singapore Art Museum is constrained when it reaches out to the international art exhibition circuit to try to attract major art exhibitions to Singapore.&nbsp; We do not have the space to do justice to these major international art exhibitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.15 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;Singaporeans' interest in the arts has grown over the years.&nbsp; I believe it is timely for us&nbsp;to have a bigger art gallery to cater to the growing needs and to add to the buzz in our city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;both Mr Seng Han Thong and Mr Charles Chong asked for an update on&nbsp;the development of the Arts School.&nbsp; Last year, also in the Committee of Supply, I informed this House that the Government had agreed to set up a pre-tertiary Arts School for artistically talented students <p align=left>Column:1585 </p>aged between 13 and 18 to pursue an integrated arts and academic programme.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have made good progress since then.&nbsp; In May 2004, MICA appointed a Steering Committee comprising private, public and people sector representatives from the arts and education communities to oversee the implementation of the Arts School Project.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to announce that the Steering Committee, after a comprehensive search, has appointed Mrs Rebecca Chew as the Principal-designate for the School.&nbsp; The Steering Committee found Mrs&nbsp;Chew, with her track record and training in education and the arts, very suitable to help plan and manage the School.&nbsp; Currently, Mrs Chew is the principal of Naval Base Secondary School.&nbsp; She&nbsp;is both an accomplished educator and administrator who has been a strong advocate for arts education throughout her career.&nbsp; We have started involving her in the planning for the Arts School and she will take on the role in a full-time capacity in December this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also pleased to announce that the Steering Committee has selected a site at Kirk Terrace, flanked by Cathay Building and Paradiz Centre for the School.&nbsp; Kirk Terrace is just at the beginning of Selegie Road.&nbsp; With such a location, the school will find synergy with the rich cultural and knowledge resources in the vicinity, such as the museums, the arts colleges, arts centres, Singapore Management University and the new National Library.&nbsp; The location will provide the students with a dynamic and inspiring environment for creativity and learning.&nbsp; The Committee has started work on the design of the School.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong asked if the School will be ready by 2007 and what facilities will be provided.&nbsp; The Committee on the Specialised Arts School had earlier proposed that the School start in 2007.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column:1586 </p> After careful consideration, the Steering Committee has decided to target for a January 2008 opening to allow more time to design and build the School and to develop its curriculum before receiving the first intake of students.&nbsp; The Arts School will be designed to provide an academic programme, together with all the visual arts, music, dance and drama studios and related facilities for the arts curriculum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng also asked about the School's intake criteria and whether the School will benefit both local and foreign students.&nbsp; In terms of admission criteria, artistic talents and interest will be of paramount importance, and intending students will be auditioned or will be required to produce their portfolio in the case of visual arts, to qualify for admission.&nbsp; Prospective students will also be assessed academically for their ability to achieve the International Baccalaureate qualification which the school is offering.&nbsp; As for&nbsp;student profile, the vast majority of the students will be Singaporeans, as the Arts School is part of our national education system.&nbsp; However, we can also expect the School to attract and accept some students from around and beyond Asia.&nbsp; This is particularly important for the Arts School and its students.&nbsp; The arts and creativity thrive upon diversity, and cross-cultural interactions contribute to this process.&nbsp; The Arts School will provide its graduates&nbsp;- our future artists, creative professionals, and arts supporters&nbsp;- with the benefits of interactions and engagements with cultures other than our own during their development stage. This will be good for our young artistic talents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to Mr Seng's suggestion for the Arts School to facilitate entry of its students to institutions, such as NAFA and LaSalle, MICA&nbsp;will consider this idea.&nbsp; The Arts School's main focus is to prepare students for the International Baccalaureate.&nbsp; But if some of the students want to go on to NAFA and LaSalle, <p align=left>Column:1587</p>we will explore with these institutions how we can have a formal linkage to facilitate such movements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to sum up, the arts and culture have done well over the past decade.&nbsp; Singapore is now a more vibrant and engaging city.&nbsp; MICA has developed and implemented a clear and targeted strategy to promote the arts and culture.&nbsp; This will continue to enrich the quality of life of our citizens and strengthen our national identity and resilience.&nbsp; I thank&nbsp;hon.

I hope the Government would give them help in the following aspects:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Financial assistance;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Space for activities and&nbsp;promotion of the literary arts; and<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Endorsement and recognition of&nbsp; literary arts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Chinese writers publish their works, conduct activities and attend international conferences overseas, they rarely receive any support from the National Arts Council.&nbsp; Invariably, they have to dig from their pockets to pay for participating in these&nbsp; activities.&nbsp; For example, once in a few years, they would organise the ASEAN Literary Camp.&nbsp; They have to raise their own funds to organise such activities.&nbsp; I hope the Government could provide funds for local literary arts bodies, such as the Singapore Literary Society, the Writers' Associations, etc, so that they could organise more local and international activities, and publish more local works.&nbsp; These works can then be promoted in the HDB heartlands, schools, and even exported to foreign markets.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On more space to promote literary arts, I hope the Government would consider allowing some disused Government buildings to be used by these literary organisations. We should encourage libraries, schools, community clubs and the media to cooperate with the local literary arts organisations.&nbsp; In addition, more local writings should be included in the curriculum of our school and in the textbooks.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On endorsement and recognition, in Malaysia, our neighbour, the Chinese literary circle has been holding the \"Hua Zhong Literature Award\" for many years, and it has become an international award, attracting literary works from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.&nbsp; In comparison, we<p align=left>Column:1589 </p> have not had such an award.&nbsp; I urge the Government to support the holding of a National Literature&nbsp;Contest to encourage and reward local writers.&nbsp; Moreover, distinguished writers&nbsp;could be awarded National Day Awards.&nbsp; There used to be a vibrant Chinese literary scene in the past, with high standards.&nbsp; In fact, Singapore was, at one time, termed as the vanguard of Southeast Asian Chinese literature.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Loh Meng See--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><I>National Library</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Loh Meng See</B>:&nbsp; Sir, first, on the subject of the National Library.&nbsp; Singapore aspires to be the centre of learning in the region.&nbsp; We are also interested to develop the education sector.&nbsp; We see&nbsp;a growing number of universities and learning institutions,</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>both local and overseas branches, being set up here.

Will these&nbsp;be accommodated in the library facilities?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore will be celebrating its 40th year of independence this year. We have over the years, books written by Singaporean authors and biographies featuring Singaporeans on their work and their lives.&nbsp; We need to celebrate the contributions of these Singaporeans towards nation-building through the books written. We should also be interested in foreign books written about Singapore and understand the perspective of others have of us.&nbsp; I hope the National Library can over time build up a collection of these precious resources, whether books and other materials, so that subsequent generations of Singaporeans can appreciate the contributions of Singaporeans, past and present, and the development of Singapore as a nation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:&nbsp; What are the plans for the new National Library building which will be completed sometime this year?&nbsp; How will this library contribute to<p align=left>Column:1591 </p> our lifelong learning strategy and help our citizens to prepare for the challenges of the rapid changes and transformations taking place in the world around us?&nbsp; Will the role of the regional libraries change in the process?&nbsp; What new activities and materials can the public expect in the new library?&nbsp; Can we look towards having the National Library being connected to the top libraries of the world?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Challenges in the ICT Sector</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the next subject is on the challenges in the ICT sector.&nbsp; Since the article, entitled \"Does IT Matter\" appeared in the Harvard Business Review, it started the intense debate in the press and journals on the value of IT investment and the benefits derived from the never-ending heavy IT investment that could be more hype than real.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen the waves of IT innovation from the years of development in phases over the years and, recently, the focus has been on the adoption and use of IT applications and the infrastructure to support them.&nbsp; Instead of installing them on their own, the option of outsourcing IT infrastructure is becoming more common using the \"utility\" model to buy IT services.&nbsp; Indeed, corporations have become increasingly vigilant and attentive to ensuring that there is a business case for IT investment and track the performance to ensure that the purported benefits are realised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consumers in Singapore, however, have been more carefree in their spending on mobile phones and portable devices. We have now a phenomenal penetration rate of 97% on mobile phones in Singapore. We recently saw the highly successful nation-wide 3G network roll-out which I believe surpassed the expectation of the three mobile operators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IT security risk and invasion of privacy&nbsp;are still areas of concern to Singaporeans.&nbsp; The press report of the weakness of the<p align=left>Column:1592</p> Social Development Unit (SDU) portal does not help in giving confidence to the users. Those who have given personal information feel exposed when breaches take place.&nbsp; This was explained as an isolated incident.&nbsp; But more can be done to ensure the integrity of the system and make very secure that private and confidential information contained in any system&nbsp;is not easily accessed by others and by determined hackers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, there was near-stagnation in global IT spending, but Singapore was able to grow in this highly competitive ICT sector.&nbsp; The outlook seems bright, considering the rise in global IT spending by companies and governments.&nbsp; The purchase of personal computers by companies and individuals&nbsp;is expected to increase. This augurs well for the players in this sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to read the report of Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU) that Singapore is the world's fourth most attractive outsourcing location and ranked first based on the number of offshoring projects relative to population. With this, we are successful in keeping jobs in Singapore. It shows that we could still be very competitive even though we are a high cost location.&nbsp; It is the total value that businesses look for and not just on cost alone.&nbsp; It is important that we build a critical mass in this area so that we can enjoy further economies of scale.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to ask the Minister:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Are there ample growth opportunities in the ICT sector in Singapore?&nbsp; What is being done to capture a larger share of the ICT market, both in Singapore and in the region?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; What is the Government doing to connect homes and increase the level of Internet usage and web applications among Singaporeans?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1593 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we have enough IT professionals to support the ICT sector and what more could be done to provide training and learning opportunities for Singaporeans who want to deepen their knowledge in IT to maximise the features and power of the personal computers?</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</B> Mr Chairman, the proliferation of digital media or new media is a testimony of their popularity, especially among youths.&nbsp; With the current availability of infrastructure, we see advancement at blazing speed of media formats - mobile devices, weblogs,&nbsp;SMS, MMS, video streaming and many more.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the technology for network convergence or the combining of voice, data and video networks into a single system is already in use and within reach for the masses.&nbsp; With the inevitable convergence of telecommunications, media and information technology, the abuse of technology could cause undesirable social changes.&nbsp; We must be prepared to face the challenges in the regulation of converging media technology.&nbsp; I echo the concern of&nbsp; Mr Loh Meng See about the security, safety and privacy of users.&nbsp; We must also build our capabilities and capacities to manage this onslaught.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister:&nbsp; what are the challenges faced by the authority with this new media and what is being done to build capabilities and capacities to tackle such problems?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to know whether such new media have been used for illegal purposes.&nbsp; And if there is, what can be done to prevent the technology from being used as such?</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Balaji Sadasivan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Information, Communications and the Arts (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</B> Sir, I want to thank the hon.

The establishment of the Lee Kong&nbsp;Chian Reference Library was made possible by the generous contribution of the Lee Foundation of $60 million to the NLB.&nbsp; The LKC Reference Library will occupy most of the space in one of the blocks at the new National Library.&nbsp; It will offer a collection of 500,000 items. This reference collection will focus on&nbsp;a wide range of topics from business to the arts.</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

Mr Loh Meng See also asked about the connectivity and networking of the library to complement the printed material collection.&nbsp; NLB would be increasing its electronic material collection from 36 databases, almost double the 19 databases, it offered in 2004, to provide users with more information resource through its digital library services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past&nbsp;three years, NLB has signed MOUs with several libraries overseas, allowing it to widen its access to collections outside Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Mr Loh Meng See also asked if the role of the existing regional libraries will change.&nbsp; I would like to reassure him that our regional libraries will continue to play their important role.&nbsp; The libraries in NLB's network complement one another and are located in different parts of Singapore to reach out to the community, thereby making it more convenient for Singaporeans to access the knowledge of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Irene Ng and Dr Ong Seh Hong were concerned about another aspect of books, namely, the writers of books, the literary artists.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, at a function, I was urged by a well-meaning<p align=left>Column:1596</p> Singaporean that we should do more for our Chinese literary artists.&nbsp; So I asked him when was the last time he bought a book of Chinese fiction written by a local author.&nbsp; He was stumped by the question and he said he read the Chinese newspapers but was too busy to read Chinese fiction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our literary artists, whether writing in English, Chinese, Malay or Tamil, need people to buy their books.&nbsp; That is the real support they need.&nbsp; In a globalised world, this is a difficult challenge.&nbsp; Chinese writers compete in the market with writers from China and Taiwan, Malay writers with those from Malaysia and Indonesia.&nbsp; Tamil writers from those in Tamil Nadu.&nbsp; And those who write in the English language, they have to compete with everybody, with writers from the whole world, because famous authors who write their works in a non-English language would have their works translated into English.&nbsp; Writers now serve a global market, and the same book, the Da Vinci Code,&nbsp;is the best seller in Singapore and many countries around the world, including non-English speaking countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore literary artists must write for the regional and global audience.&nbsp; Some Singapore writers have succeeded in doing this.&nbsp; Eugene and Yen Puay Noi in the Chinese language, Abdul Ghani and Masuri in the Malay language,&nbsp; J M Sali in the Tamil language, are well-known overseas.&nbsp; Tan Tee Hwee's second novel, Memo Inc, was internationally acclaimed and was on the W H Smith's top 20 Best Sellers list in Asia for more than two months.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MICA has schemes to help and encourage Singapore literary talent.&nbsp; The idea is to give them an opportunity to get a start, so that Singaporeans with the talent of Dan Brown, the author of the Da Vinci Code, would have an opportunity to emerge and take their place on the regional and global literary scene.&nbsp; MICA<p align=left>Column:1597 </p> supports the local literary arts scene through programmes managed by the National Arts Council (NAC).&nbsp; The NAC provides financial assistance&nbsp;to writers through publishing grants, training and travel grants, as well as project grants for literary arts events and projects.&nbsp; In FY 2004, financial assistance to writers through these grants increased by 16%.&nbsp; So in reply to Dr Ong's request for aid to writers, I am happy to let him know that last year, $325,000 was given to literary artists to support their work.&nbsp; In addition, we are also helping them with housing.&nbsp; The NAC supports the literary arts, through&nbsp;the Arts Housing Scheme, which subsidises arts premises to literary arts groups, such as the Sin Sheng Poet Society and the Association of Singapore Tamil Writers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong also suggested a literature award for writers.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform the House that last year, NAC supported the National Book Development Council in organising the annual Singapore literature prize.&nbsp; In addition, NAC organises the biennial NAC-SPH Golden Point Award, which provides a national platform by identifying literary arts talent in the four official languages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Loh Meng See was concerned about the health of the infocomm sector and asked if Singapore's IT sector could grow when there was near stagnation in global IT spending.&nbsp; I am happy to say that our IT sector is healthy.&nbsp; Singapore's infocomm industry remains one of the key engines of growth for the economy.&nbsp; The pipeline for investments remains strong.&nbsp; Last year, the infocomm and media cluster was the second strongest contributor to investment commitments in the service industry, with $647 million in business spending, generating $1.3 billion in total value-add and 3,000 professional and skilled jobs.&nbsp; Revenues from the infocomm sector are expected to grow by<p align=left>Column:1598 </p> 6% in 2004 to $34.7 billion and to grow by 7.4% this year to $37.3 billion.&nbsp; The number of infocomm professionals employed is expected to grow by 3% to more than 108,000 in the coming year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are new growth opportunities in the infocomm sector, as pointed out by Mr Loh.&nbsp; Business process outsourcing (BPO) is a growth area and we have enjoyed success in this area.&nbsp; As pointed out by Mr Loh, Singapore is ranked No. 1 in the world for offshore projects per million population and ranked 6th globally in absolute numbers.&nbsp; Our high quality telecoms infrastructure,&nbsp;conducive regulatory environment, and&nbsp;well-educated workforce make us a very competitive location for higher-end outsourcing processes and services.&nbsp; These include business continuity, disaster recovery, IT strategy and security implementation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of infocomm technologies is pervasive in Singapore.&nbsp; Singapore's Internet penetration rate is one of the highest in the world, with&nbsp;two out of every&nbsp;three households and&nbsp;three out of every&nbsp;four companies, having access to the Internet.&nbsp; More than 42% of households have a broadband connection.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin&nbsp;has pointed out that the technologies IT and media sectors are converging and asked what MICA is doing about that.&nbsp; The next few years will be exciting ones, with opportunities for the innovative as the telecoms, broadcast and media and IT sectors converged.&nbsp; Convergence could very well shake up all the sectors.&nbsp; But the shake-up will provide opportunities for those who are innovative.&nbsp; For the consumers, convergence holds exciting promises.&nbsp; Some time in this exciting future, on a mobile one could talk to another person in New York at a fraction of the cost today because the voice information would be digitalised and sent across the Internet using VOIP technology.&nbsp; Or, one could watch the news or a movie on one's handphone or<p align=left>Column:1599 </p> plug one's handphone on a plasma screen to watch&nbsp;a movie - a&nbsp;service that could be provided by one's telecoms operator.&nbsp; Or one could have wireless broadband through WIMAX, a service provided by&nbsp;one's&nbsp;broadcaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The infocomm, media, and&nbsp;broadcast sectors are overlapping and merging.&nbsp; To promote growth in this new merged sector, MICA and its statutory boards, the IDA and the MDA have adopted a multi-pronged strategy.&nbsp; IDA has been actively facilitating the deployment of infrastructure that will enable Singapore to employ these new technologies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, young people today could look forward to an exciting world that technology is creating for them.&nbsp; Sir, some Members may remember the excitement we enjoyed during our National Service days playing \"Space Invaders\" at the canteen in SAFTI.&nbsp; Young people today have not heard of \"Space Invaders\".&nbsp; They play computer games on Playstation 2 in near virtual reality with movie screen quality images.&nbsp; Members in this House communicate with email.&nbsp; The young talk to the world on blog sites.&nbsp; We think in terms of SDU to meet new people.&nbsp; They link up to the&nbsp;Third Degree on Friendster.&nbsp; It is a really cool world for young people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While these technological advances are exciting, we must protect the vulnerable young from being exploited and prevent technology from being used for illegal purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; To address these challenges, MDA already has in place a light touch class licence regulatory framework that ensures the industry maintains some minimum standards with regard to the Internet, SMS, MMS, and other forms of new media services.&nbsp; We also have deterrent legislation like the Computer Misuse Act and the Penal Code to prevent the illegal use or abuse of such technologies.&nbsp; MICA also intends to introduce a legislation to control spam this year.&nbsp; But there is a limit to what<p align=left>Column:1600 </p> legislation could do in an environment where information travels across borders in bits and bytes.&nbsp; We need to educate parents and children to become more discerning and responsible end-users.&nbsp; We also need to educate organisations to pay more attention to security and&nbsp;the use of the same default passwords on the SDU website was a contributing factor to the lapse in security at that site.&nbsp; So MDA is working with companies and volunteer groups like Parents Advisory Group for the Internet (PAGi) and Touch Community Services.&nbsp; To help the community deal with Internet security, MDA has provided over $2.3 million in funding support for activities and programmes that help the community deal with dangers on the Internet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the infocomm and media sectors offer great opportunities for our economy and new exciting lifestyles for our young.&nbsp; With the light regulatory touch, MICA's goal is to maximise these opportunities and minimise the downside.&nbsp; I have presented an overview.&nbsp; In our&nbsp;digital age, for more information, Members could log on to www.mica.gov.sg.&nbsp; I thank the Members for their cuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I quote, \"Up to the 1970s, in our markets and hawker centres, bazaar Malay was the <I>lingua franca</I>.&nbsp; Everyone could understand and speak some Malay because of our bilingual policy.&nbsp; Today, the <I>lingua franca</I> is English or Singlish.&nbsp; Few non-Malays can understand or speak Bahasa.&nbsp; We must remedy this.\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what could we do to bring back some of the warmth of the kampong days when everyone could communicate in a little of each other's language?&nbsp; Sir, one <p align=left>Column:1601</p>way I think is to learn Malay through TV programmes.&nbsp; However, I was a little surprised when I found out that there is only a free-to-air Malay channel, Suria.&nbsp; My grassroots leaders have pointed out that even if they apply to pay television such as cable TV, there is only one Indonesian and one Malaysian channel, supplying them programmes&nbsp;with a setting and&nbsp;content not entirely familiar to them.&nbsp; The lack of more Malay television channels also undermines the effort of the community to promote Malay language and culture.&nbsp; The call for an additional Malay channel is not to reduce the importance of Suria.&nbsp; On the contrary, it highlights the important role played by television.&nbsp; In the earlier years of Singapore,&nbsp;television shows featuring P Ramlee could be appreciated by almost all Singaporeans.&nbsp; Maybe it is high time to promote the use of the Malay language through more entertaining and easy-to-understand Malay television progammes.&nbsp; The new channel should also focus on bringing in more educational programmes like Discovery&nbsp;and Animal Planet channels&nbsp;dubbed in Malay.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in this light, I urge the Media Development Authority to consider promoting the setting up of an additional Malay language television channel.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, Singapore is trying to develop its creative industries.&nbsp; Animation, film, TV and video, scriptwriting and even games are getting the best clothes to go to the grand ball known as Media Hub.&nbsp; But, left behind among the cinders and ashes is our own version of Cinderella - local music.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To a local musician like me, even though my CD is only sold overseas, only&nbsp;a fairy godmother could help the local music scene to take off.&nbsp; How could it,<p align=left>Column:1602 </p> when our radio stations hardly play local songs, especially English ones?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is some hope.&nbsp; Our Prime Minister, no less, has called for diversity and urged our youths to follow their passions.&nbsp; So, would Cinderella get her just rewards after slogging so hard?&nbsp; She has what it takes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, several local musicians performed at the first \"Made in Singapore\" concert.&nbsp; A friend of mine was duly impressed and told me our musicians just need a platform to be heard.&nbsp; I am very happy to hear that Creative Community Singapore would further encourage projects like Jam Series by Arts for Us All.&nbsp; Anyway, along came a pumpkin-turned-stagecoach called Singapore Idol, which carried Taufik Batisah to the crown, with lots of support.&nbsp; The lesson is clear.&nbsp; To succeed, Singaporeans need opportunities.&nbsp; To follow our passions, we need space.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is space on TV.&nbsp; MDA supports local programming because it is socially relevant and creates national identity.&nbsp; Local music does the same.&nbsp; So, why not have local content requirements for radio airplay?&nbsp; I would like to ask if MDA could look into this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In theory, some might think the direction of the local music industry should be market driven.&nbsp; But that is a vicious cycle.&nbsp; Fixed playlists mean local musicians could not compete fairly, even if they wanted to.&nbsp; Radio airplay is the most influential factor in music purchases.&nbsp; The public&nbsp;is more interested in a band whose songs they have heard on the radio.&nbsp; It gives them something to identify with and makes them perceive the band as successful.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And should cultural imperatives be left entirely to the market?&nbsp; In practice, the quota system works for the music industry.&nbsp; Canada, South Africa, France<p align=left>Column:1603</p> and Australia introduced quotas.&nbsp; Musical infrastructure, royalty payments and domestic sales grew, some to record highs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Musicians had&nbsp;more resources and incentives to produce better music.&nbsp; Quotas increased as more local music could be supported.&nbsp; It is a virtuous cycle.&nbsp; Germany, on the other hand, rejected quotas.&nbsp; Its music industry shrank and it is now having a rethink.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it is a voluntary system, as in New Zealand, a minimum percentage of hours a week, or number of songs per clock hour, as in the Philippines, the mechanism could be worked out.&nbsp; There are many options, even a tier-system for different genres.&nbsp; We could consult the stakeholders.&nbsp; I would be happy to take ownership and get involved, as long as we consider the idea and do not dismiss it out of hand.&nbsp; Else, talk of diversity and following our passions would turn to ashes.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;<I>Captioning of TV News</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I was very happy when the Prime Minister, at his swearing-in, held up a caring and inclusive society as part of his vision for Singapore.&nbsp; Hence, I would like to raise an old issue, which under the new dispensation should be looked at more kindly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hearing-impaired community would love to feel included, and part of Singapore.&nbsp; One crucial way to do this is via TV captioning or subtitling of the news and other programmes.&nbsp; Many people think mistakenly that the issue is about access to information.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

There are about 5,300 people registered with the Singapore Association for the Deaf.&nbsp; The total number of hearing impaired here probably is higher.&nbsp; This is similar to New Zealand, which has a smaller population base and 7,700 hearing-impaired people.&nbsp; Yet, it captions at least 65 hours of programming a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia has a Bill that requires above seven hours of captioned programmes daily, including the news and current affairs shows.&nbsp; In 2010, all programmes are to be captioned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do we have, save for one-off occasions like the National Day Rally?&nbsp; It is one thing to say we consider the needs of our hearing-impaired.&nbsp; It is another to provide for it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While costs may be a concern, there are more options now than before.&nbsp; Newsrooms are becoming electric.&nbsp; Scripts can be entered into a computer network and broadcast as captions.&nbsp; If<p align=left>Column:1605 </p> needed, breaking news can be excluded, given the greater difficulties.&nbsp; Advertisers can come on board to generate goodwill.&nbsp; MDA collects $95 million in annual radio and TV licences to pay for public service broadcasting and support national and community interests.&nbsp; We could use this.&nbsp; Maybe each channel could select one show each week to caption too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point is, let us have something, anything, on a long-term basis.&nbsp; We are limited only by our creativity and political will.&nbsp; I would be most happy to work with MDA to enact a Bill on this, if necessary.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</B> Sir, I would like to thank Dr Ong Seh Hong for raising the question of the need to have Malay language programming for cable TV.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore's broadcast landscape, Malay TV and radio audiences are served by Suria, a Malay TV channel, and two radio stations (Warna and Ria) operated by MediaCorp.&nbsp; StarHub Cable Vision has two channels targeted at Malay viewers.&nbsp; These are TV1 from Malaysia and the Indonesian channel TVRI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suria has done well in catering to the needs of the Malay community.&nbsp; Its programme has grown and improved over the past five years.&nbsp; Suria's strength is in the local programmes.&nbsp; It provides news, current affairs, children's drama, and variety&nbsp;programmes.&nbsp; These programmes are funded by MDA, which provided $17.4 million last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have taken note of Dr Ong's suggestion on having more Malay programming on cable TV.&nbsp; While there are already Malay programmes on both Suria and also SCV, we agree that the programming could be improved to <p align=left>Column:1606 </p>provide viewers with greater variety and choice.&nbsp; This will require investment in content and programming by the cable operator.&nbsp; If SCV finds it viable and is able to offer another pay cable channel with programming for the Malay community, it should work with MDA who will consider the application on its merits, including the ability to provide localised and differentiated programming to&nbsp;cater to the needs of the Malay community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now move to the question of giving radio air-time for local musicians raised by Ms Olsen.&nbsp; Sir, our Singapore radio stations do provide a respectable amount of air-time representing the music of local artistes.&nbsp; The newly-launched Lush 99.5 FM station has a dedicated weekday 7 to 10 am time belt which features local musicians. Power 98, in its Sunday 5 to 7 pm slot, also features local musicians.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese stations Y.E.S. 93.3 FM, Dongli 88.3 FM, and UFM 100.3 FM have similarly devoted air-time to local artistes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay stations Warna and Ria&nbsp;play at least&nbsp;one local song&nbsp;per hour, or an average of 20 local songs are played&nbsp;each day.&nbsp; In addition, a weekly programme on Ria called Artis Kita&nbsp;aired on Sundays also showcases local talents.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given this, it is not necessary to stipulate a minimum number of hours of air-time to be devoted to local music.&nbsp; The stations need the flexibility to select music that appeals to their listeners, and this would include the works of both local and foreign musicians.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, we will examine how to provide more support to local musicians, especially the budding ones. Some of our musicians have made it to the world stage and we should show them through our radio.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On subtitling or captioning for the hearing-impaired raised by Ms Olsen, I would say that it is difficult for pro<p align=left>Column:1607 </p>grammes, like news bulletins, to be accurately subtitled, due to their on-the-air nature and time sensitivity.&nbsp; Nowadays, news bulletins are a mixture of reads by newsreaders, video-packages and \"live\" cross-overs to correspondents.&nbsp; The content of \"live\" cross-overs is unscripted.&nbsp; These practices make subtitling very difficult.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of subtitles, broadcasters currently do provide captions summarising the key points in news bulletins aired on Channel NewsAsia and Channel 5.&nbsp; This represents a good balance between addressing the broadcaster's operational constraints, and allowing the hearing impaired and senior citizens to follow the news programmes.&nbsp; Viewers who want greater elaboration can turn to Teletext or the CNA news website which&nbsp;is updated regularly.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, since 2003, the&nbsp;MDA has worked with MediaCorp to subtitle the Prime Minister's National Day message, something which Ms Olsen said is not a big deal, but we have made a start.&nbsp; MDA is also working out an arrangement with the broadcaster to provide subtitles for official scripted speeches that are carried live such as the President's Address at the opening of Parliament.&nbsp; MDA will continue to explore with the broadcaster on&nbsp;the possibility of providing subtitles for other selected information programmes on CNA and Channel 5.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;Ms Olsen's&nbsp;suggestion of providing subtitling of non-English programmes, many TV programmes shown in Mandarin, Malay and Tamil already have English subtitles.&nbsp; However, MDA will look into this matter with the idea of implementing it, not just studying it, bearing in mind the constraints that the operator will face.</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

What I meant was that it was a one-off<p align=left>Column:1608 </p> thing and whether we could see that it is more sustainable.&nbsp; I also said that there are a lot of different methods nowadays that are very cost effective, and a lot of countries have studied it as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there is Teletext and everything,&nbsp;but what I was referring to was more inclusiveness, in terms of family togetherness for the hearing impaired.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</B> Sir, let me answer the second question first.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have said in my reply, it is almost difficult for us to stipulate to the broadcaster the percentage of local music that ought to be played every day.&nbsp; Because the different radio stations would cater for different needs, and some of them would have greater need to play local music.&nbsp; Let me give the Member an example.&nbsp;&nbsp;Between&nbsp;Warna and Ria, we have more local music played by Warna than Ria, because the tendency of Ria listeners is to listen to more westernised or rock music.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Chinese and English radio stations, I think they are making real effort.&nbsp; They are getting more feedback on the types of music that the locals wish&nbsp;to hear.&nbsp; They even went&nbsp;to the marketplace and interviewed local people to know&nbsp;how some of the local music would be presented on the air.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question of captions, I wonder how the New Zealand broadcasters managed to do it.&nbsp; But as I explained earlier, the modern TV presentation on news is such that when you have the news carried, say, by&nbsp;Channel NewsAsia, we have the news reader in Singapore reading the news from a prepared text <p align=left>Column:1609 </p>which is captionable.&nbsp; We then cross over to Indonesia to get the CNA Indonesian correspondent to give a live interview, say, with the President of Indonesia - that is not captionable.&nbsp; And then the&nbsp;correspondent goes to interview Indonesian listeners for their views&nbsp;- that is not captionable -&nbsp;and then back to the studio.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think to avoid listeners from having a truncated&nbsp;form of the news which is being packaged in the form of news, interviews, commentaries and inputs, we will have to look into better technology to have subtitling or captioning&nbsp;incorporated.&nbsp; But I am not saying that we are not going to do it.&nbsp; We will be studying the technology to see how we could overcome the serious hindrances and achieve Ms Olsen's dream.</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Member is referring to.&nbsp; This is a growing area.&nbsp; The film industry is still at its infancy at this point in time.&nbsp; We have had some successes with local production.&nbsp; The most prominent, of course, is Mr Jack Neo and his series of films, which&nbsp;are, by now, very well known.&nbsp; In fact, we are showing one of his films in the Singapore Season in London.&nbsp; I think it is \"I Not Stupid\", <I>Xiao Hai Bu Ben</I>.&nbsp; I think it was a very popular<p align=left>Column:1612 </p> film.&nbsp; So we are showing it in London in the Singapore Season.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of co-production, the Media Development Authority has supported several film makers.&nbsp; I recall a recent example, that is, \"House of Harmony\", which&nbsp;was a co-production between a Singapore film company&nbsp;and a German television company.&nbsp; The film has been completed.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;shot entirely in Singapore.&nbsp; It stars Fann Wong as the leading star and&nbsp;leading lady in the film.&nbsp; It is a period film set in Singapore, in the 1920s, during the colonial era.&nbsp; It is a romantic film.&nbsp; I have seen the rough cuts of the film.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;quite an&nbsp;interesting film.&nbsp; I think&nbsp;it should appeal to a wide audience.&nbsp; It will be released, first, in Germany because that is the agreement under their co-production venture.&nbsp; But we will be able to see the film, I think, soon after the release in Germany.&nbsp; There are several other joint ventures and&nbsp;co-productions underway.&nbsp; And we hope some, if not all of these, will succeed, and some of them could become international hits.&nbsp; In fact, on Monday, 7th March 2005, I am attending the premiere of the first Singapore-made science fiction movie, \"Avatar\".&nbsp; I am looking forward to enjoying the movie.&nbsp;I hope that this is an indication of things to come that our film makers will branch into different areas.&nbsp; They will go into period films, like the House of Harmony. They will go into more fashionable, science fiction, using the latest computer generated imaging technology to produce special effects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we are making some headway.&nbsp; But as I said, at the beginning, the industry is still in its infancy.&nbsp; We have international players entering the sector in Singapore.&nbsp; Lucasfilm has set up a studio in Singapore; an Indian film producer has set up a digital studio in Singapore.&nbsp; So we should see a gathering of momentum in the years ahead.&nbsp; And Media Development Authority will continue to support Singapore's co-production effort to<p align=left>Column:1613</p> encourage our film producers and directors to work with international parties so that we can have a greater outreach and also to learn from these more experienced international film producers and tap their distribution network.&nbsp;</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Among the schemes, our efforts include cultivating and engaging the overseas publishing houses so that they will be interested in publishing the works of&nbsp;our writers, exploring internships of Singaporean publishing professionals at international publishing houses for the purpose of understanding how these markets work.&nbsp; We are also reviewing our current grant schemes to enhance support in areas like translation, so as to make it more conducive for our publishers and writers to get their works translated so that the market for their works should be greater.&nbsp; We are working with our MOU partners to identify key festivals overseas so that their works can be showcased.&nbsp; Also, we are working with our MOU partners abroad to see if we can profile our writers abroad so that their market reach is greater.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</B> Thank you for the request for further clarification.&nbsp; I think there is a difference between TV requirement versus radio requirement.&nbsp; It is slightly different in the sense that we are talking about songs, as compared to a mix of production genre.&nbsp; For the television programmes, you may have current affairs,&nbsp;or scenes that capture Singapore's culture, its people, which <p align=left>Column:1615</p>have a&nbsp;tremendous value, in terms of social education and nation building.&nbsp; In terms of songs, there is a slight variation.&nbsp; I am not saying that songs do not have a role in nation building.&nbsp; It does tremendously, if the theme of the song covers mainly the love for the nation, love for the people, the leaders, and so on.&nbsp; My answer is that, what makes it different is that the TV programme has a requirement&nbsp;because it&nbsp;directly affects nation building. Whereas for radio, there is less requirement.&nbsp; But I must say that there is a greater realisation on the part of our local broadcast station to play more local songs.&nbsp; I would say that, compared to five years ago, we have done quite a lot.&nbsp; Apart from just playing local songs, some of the radio stations&nbsp;even&nbsp;have certain&nbsp;times of the day to play some songs.&nbsp; I will give you an example.&nbsp;&nbsp;Station UFM 100.3 FM, for example, every Sunday, between 10&nbsp;pm and 12 midnight, for three hours, you have all the airings of local songs.&nbsp; Three hours per week may not&nbsp;be much, in terms of percentage or proportion.&nbsp; But I would say that if you have one Chinese radio station that allocates a certain&nbsp;amount of hours for Chinese local songs, that is a progress.&nbsp; Of course, we will persuade them to have more time.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B> Sir, I would just want to add a little supplement to what the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has said.&nbsp; It is not as if MICA and Media Development&nbsp;Authority&nbsp;are not doing anything at all to encourage or cajole our broadcaster along the way to show their support for the local music industry.&nbsp; I am sure Ms Olsen will know that in early January, in fact, MediaCorp Radio launched a new station, called \"Lush 99.5\".&nbsp; Lush is a station that took over the frequency of Passion Radio in the past, which was the Arts Channel.&nbsp; In fact, MediaCorp was allocated this channel to run a new station, and MediaCorp has indicated that they will also do what they can to</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>promote both<p align=left>Column:1616 </p> the local arts scene, including local music on the new station Lush 99.5.&nbsp; So, I would suggest that Ms Olsen tune in more frequently to Lush 99.5 and see whether it is doing its job promoting local arts and local music.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>4.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Loo Choon Yong (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp; Sir, on the question of subtitling the news broadcast, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary, in answering Ms Olsen, said that we will wait for the technology to improve, then we can subtitle the local ones and the foreign newscasts.&nbsp; Why has it got to be all or none?&nbsp; Yesterday, in this House, hon.

So, you will notice that we do provide captioning and, in fact, crawlers are used extensively, particularly on Channel NewsAsia.&nbsp; Crawlers are the running line of words at the bottom of the screen, and crawlers would give you an update on the news headline and key events that are shaping up in Singapore and around the world.&nbsp; So, it is not as if the hearing-impaired have got no access or contact with real-time news broadcasting.&nbsp; But to go extensively into subtitling is a totally different ball game.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to look&nbsp;at the possibilities.&nbsp; It is not just a question of technology.&nbsp; It is a question of timeliness<p align=left>Column:1618</p> of news, as my Senior Parliamentary Secretary has explained.&nbsp; There are many other factors involved.&nbsp; It is something that we will continue to look into.&nbsp; The answer is not cast in stone, that it is forever no.&nbsp; There could be new developments.&nbsp;

First, let me say that MICA has done a wonderful job&nbsp;to create a very vibrant arts scene in Singapore.&nbsp; But I wonder if the Minister is aware that despite this, arts groups and artists in Singapore still struggle for a living.&nbsp; They live from hand to mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am not talking about budding artists or arts groups.&nbsp; I am talking about the established ones, including some of those that the Minister mentioned.&nbsp; For example, there was something in the press recently that Han Sai Por, one of our award winning artists internationally known abroad, may have to close down her studio because of high rentals.&nbsp; And Ivan Heng of Wild Rice has recently written an article in one of the arts magazines bemoaning the fact that the pie for local arts groups is shrinking rapidly.&nbsp; They are in the position of SMEs competing with multinationals.&nbsp; So, they are competing for venues, sponsorships and audience.</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp;

I understand that&nbsp;we have to create a fine balance between an international hub with international block<p align=left>Column:1619 </p>busters and supporting the local arts scene.&nbsp; But, perhaps, this balance could be adjusted to give better support to Singapore artists and arts groups.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B> Sir, I think what the hon. Nominated Member mentioned is not too far from what we are doing.&nbsp; In fact, MICA and NAC do give a tremendous level of support to local arts and arts groups.&nbsp; But, of course, as I have said earlier in my response to Ms Irene Ng about the acquisition of artworks, the budget is never enough for this purpose.&nbsp; Even though, overall, we face a budget crunch and Ministries are asked to cut down budget, what MICA has obtained for the National Arts Council, the principal agency that is nurturing, supporting and developing arts and the arts groups, has actually increased over the years.&nbsp; If you look at last year's NAC allocation, in terms of operating cost, it had $34.6 million.&nbsp; This year,&nbsp; it will get $36.9 million.&nbsp; So, despite the budget constraints and the tightening of&nbsp;the purse strings by the Minister for Finance, the NAC was able to obtain 7% more funds for deployment to support the arts and arts groups.&nbsp; And most of these funds will go towards nurturing the local arts community and supporting them in one way or another.&nbsp; It may not be direct grants, but includes supporting events and performances, and so on and so forth.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, it is not true to say that we have neglected the local arts groups and over-weighted our investments in the arts to international big-ticket blockbuster events.&nbsp; We are conscious of the need to nurture the local artistic community and we will continue to do so within our means.&nbsp; In the case of Ms Han Sai Por,&nbsp;she faces a special problem, because the premises that she was renting at Seletar Airbase, I understand, may not be available&nbsp;to her in the near future.&nbsp; So, she has to move to another location.&nbsp; That is a problem that many other Singaporeans, besides artists,&nbsp;eg, small businessmen, also face.&nbsp; We <p align=left>Column:1620</p>have heard so many complaints about the difficulties&nbsp;small businessmen face, such as having to relocate, high rentals, etc.&nbsp; This is a problem not unique to just artists and the arts community.&nbsp; I think they will have to find a way to support themselves, to compete for resources and&nbsp;survive&nbsp;within the context of our society and&nbsp;economy.&nbsp; I understand that the theatre groups, epitomised by Wild Rice and Ivan Heng, face continuing challenges and difficulties in making a commercial proposition out of their efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what I have said earlier on.&nbsp; We have made progress in the arts, but we have not quite arrived yet, where&nbsp;artists can achieve commercial success because the audience values their creative capabilities, output and their works, so as to&nbsp;afford them a return that is commensurate with their time and creative energy.&nbsp; But, over time, as we develop the arts, as more and more Singaporeans become aware and conscious of the value of the arts, then I think we will see a change.&nbsp; And I am beginning to see improvements in this area.&nbsp; There are already performances which are able to make a surplus, ie,&nbsp;after they have paid up all the expenses, they still make a surplus.&nbsp; So, it shows that there is a business model that is a successful commercial proposition in some of the activities undertaken by the arts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give&nbsp;Members an example of an arts event which was largely a local Singaporean initiative,&nbsp;Forbidden City. This&nbsp;was first commissioned for the opening of the Esplanade in 2002.&nbsp; It was in late 2003 or early 2004 that they reprised the production of Forbidden City, and it was very successful.&nbsp; They generated a surplus from the reprise of Forbidden City.&nbsp; The box-office takings were more than expenses and they could make a profit out of it.&nbsp; So, this is a good indicator that if you have a good product, a creative product that is of interest to a <p align=left>Column:1621 </p>big enough audience, you will be able to make a profit out of the venture and, in fact, do well for yourself.&nbsp; And that is a challenge, and I would say the inspiration, for all the artists out there to try to reach this level of success and recognition.&nbsp;</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seng Han Thong:</B> Sir, on behalf of all the Members who have spoken, may I thank the Minister and the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for their updates on the arts scene and the various programmes initiated by MICA, as well as for&nbsp;your patience on certain clarifications.&nbsp; I&nbsp;observe that some of the Members are happy with the answers and some are not happy.&nbsp; However, everyone was entertained by the Senior Parliamentary Secretary's creative answer on the <I>sarong</I>&nbsp;cut.&nbsp; I believe that, with all these initiatives, we are now able to move on from level 2&nbsp;of a cultured society and cultured Singaporeans to level 3.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Sir, I beg to withdraw the amendment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sum of $341,299,400 for Head Q ordered to stand part of the Main Estimates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sum of $224,307,600 for Head Q ordered to stand part of the Development Estimates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HEAD J - MINISTRY OF DEFENCE--><p align=left>Column: 1621<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Head J - Ministry of Defence</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; Head J - Ministry of Defence.&nbsp; Mr Ravindran, you can take your two cuts together.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ravindran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><I>Defence Policy</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ravindran</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the total sum to be allocated for Head J of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, everyone takes the country's defence very seriously.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>Among Singa<p align=left>Column:1622 </p>poreans, defence is a subject of great concern.&nbsp; I am very happy that this year, the Government has decided to increase the budget allocation for the Ministry of Defence by 7.4%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some Singaporeans may wonder why have&nbsp;they increased when all other Ministries have suffered a cut in the budget.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to share with them what I saw recently and tell them why it is critical to be prepared when a crisis occurs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I was part of the team of MPs who visited Aceh during the tsunami crisis.&nbsp; What was most impressive was our ability to bring humanitarian assistance from here to Medan, Banda Aceh and Meulaboh by air.&nbsp; It was also to deliver aid and other equipment by sea from our LSTs to the land, and on land, being able to travel using our own vehicles, setting up hospitals, fully-equipped, with our medicine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One or two commanders highlighted to me that many other groups came there, but they came without the necessary equipment. They said it was no use coming there with&nbsp;a ship with aid, but being unable to deliver it on shore,&nbsp;or delivering the aid on shore and not being able to deliver it to the people who need it most.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what this highlights is that we have an SAF that has prudently thought through the process on how do we go about acquiring the equipment, how do we go about deploying these resources, and most importantly, being able to deploy it at a time when it is most needed. This can be compared with some of the comments made by some of the regional commanders in some countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;In one country, one commander commented that only 40% of their airforce is operational.&nbsp; In some cases,<p align=left>Column:1623 </p> they have warships that were unable to sail because they did not have spare parts.&nbsp; In some cases, they bought aircraft which have no armaments.&nbsp; So it was no use flying an aircraft when you have no armaments.&nbsp;I am happy that the SAF has done well and has shown not only to Singaporeans, but to the whole world, that we spend our money prudently and we prepare ourselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what I would like to see is that&nbsp;this policy of spending our money well be continued, that&nbsp;we continue our procurement,&nbsp;that we continue our preparedness and that we ensure the way we spend and prepare ourselves is continued in future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am very happy that our defence policy is based on two key pillars.&nbsp; One is defence diplomacy&nbsp; and the other is deterrence.&nbsp; Sir, I am very happy that defence diplomacy paid off even during the Aceh crisis.&nbsp; I notice that because of the SAF-TNI relationship, we were able to get to know the officers very quickly and assist not only our Indonesian friends, but also assist in relief effort of various other agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have heard very favourable comments, not only from TNI officers but also from other military officers with whom the SAF has interacted on how Singapore's SAF officers have gone about establishing relationship and creating better understanding, not only between the military forces of the two countries, but also within the various organisations of the two countries.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to see and hear from the Minister how he intends to develop this initiative in the area of defence diplomacy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the area of deterrence, I am very happy that we will be continuing to spend large amounts of money in procurement.

And we always stress our twin pillars of our defence policy, which is<p align=left>Column:1630 </p> diplomacy and deterrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, increasingly, the SAF is being asked to play a bigger role in terms of peacekeeping and humanitarian and relief missions, and I wonder whether, like together with the rest of my colleagues, the SAF might want to review its priorities and expand its role.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although&nbsp;our SAF did a sterling job in the humanitarian mission in Indonesia, and as the report did note that many of its troops were going in cold, with no procedures or precedents to fall back on, I wonder if the Minister could consider reviewing the force structure to see if it would be useful to have a force dedicated to humanitarian relief to support the international community's military responsibilities for the safety and well-being of people wherever they are in peril.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Warren Lee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><I>3G SAF</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Warren Lee</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the nature of armed conflicts&nbsp;seems to be changing.&nbsp; As we have seen in Iraq, Afghanistan, and more regional conflicts, small numbers of well-armed individuals seem to be able to disrupt vastly better equipped forces in what has often been called asymmetric warfare.&nbsp; Also, the armed forces is sometimes not only called upon to wage war but is also sometimes an instrument of peace and assistance, as many Members have talked about in the recent tsunami disaster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as we move into an era of low-intensity conflict and a blurring of distinction between civilians, combatants and terrorists, the conventional armed forces which rely on massing firepower and men on the ground, against fixed defended enemy positions and well-defined targets, may well find itself unable to cope with more fluid situations, where the enemy is not necessarily wearing a different uniform and occupying a different hill.&nbsp; As we have seen, images on a TV screen could be powerful shapers <p align=left>Column:1631 </p>of public opinion, and allegation of ill-treatment of civilians and captured enemies could distort perception of who exactly is the aggressor and who is the aggrieved party.&nbsp; Nevertheless, conventional forces are&nbsp;still needed as the country would still require a visible, credible and well-equipped armed forces to deter conventional aggressors.&nbsp; Would we have enough people and resources to man both our conventional forces and the specialised units needed to deal with these unconventional threats?&nbsp; What is the SAF doing to evolve itself into an armed forces capable of dealing with these threats in a more effective way, in a time of limited resources and limitation on manpower?&nbsp; How could we best deploy our NS cohorts and train them to be able to effectively meet these new challenges while maintaining our competencies in conventional warfare?&nbsp; Have we trained our men to deal with the media war?&nbsp; How&nbsp;do we&nbsp;deal with the NGOs, observers and aid agencies who are often on the ground in the arena of conflict?</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, much has been made of the SAF being transformed into a 3G armed forces.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> Mr Chairman,&nbsp; Sir, first of all, I would like to thank Members for their pertinent comments and timely questions on Singapore's defence and <p align=left>Column:1634 </p>security, and for their endorsements of confidence in the Singapore Armed Forces.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 40 years since our independence, Singapore has made steady progress as a nation.&nbsp; We have been able to focus on our socio-economic development.&nbsp; This has brought Singaporeans a comfortable standard of living and given Singapore a certain standing in the world community.&nbsp; Our unity as a society, and as a nation, has been enhanced.&nbsp; All this has been possible because we have peace and security.&nbsp; That is the absolute essential foundation for our growth and progress as a nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The peace and security we have enjoyed is not to be taken for granted.&nbsp; It is also not something we can attribute to good fortune alone.&nbsp; Singapore has enjoyed peace and security over these 40 years because we have dedicated, year after year, much effort and resources to building the twin pillars of our defence, namely, deterrence and diplomacy, as Mr Ravindran has noted.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as the remarks of some Members suggest, it is clear that our security environment has become much more complex in recent years, and the spectrum of potential threats has expanded.&nbsp; The uncertainties and potential instabilities will continue to be a feature of the regional landscape.&nbsp; We will always need to have a military capability which can defend Singapore's territorial integrity and sovereignty.&nbsp; Our defence capability must also give us the confidence to assert our rights as an independent sovereign nation.&nbsp; With the political space to take decisions which best serve Singapore's interests,&nbsp; we need not feel intimidated when the regional climate turns sour, as happens from time to time, as we all well know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond that, the SAF must also be able to deal with low-intensity conflict<p align=left>Column:1635 </p> situations and terrorism.&nbsp; The threat of terrorism continues to be real and immediate.&nbsp; It will not go away any time soon,&nbsp;as terrorist groups are unwavering in their determination to wreak havoc and destruction, Singapore continues to remain a prime target.&nbsp; Countering this threat requires a multiplicity of effort - by governments acting alone, and in cooperation with one another, and, as Mr Ravindran and Dr Ong Chit Chung have pointed out, by multiple national agencies bringing together the many capabilities needed to deal with the terrorists and the variety of weapons and in the various domains of land, sea and air.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Leong Horn Kee has asked whether the SAF has coordinated with other agencies, such as MHA.&nbsp; Indeed, we have, and this is the reason why the Prime Minister has appointed Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Tony Tan, as the Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence.&nbsp; His main focus is actually to coordinate the various Ministries, not just MINDEF and the Ministry of Home Affairs, but also the Economic Ministries, the Ministry of Health and other Ministries, in order to make sure that Singapore is well coordinated to deal with this threat of terrorism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Chit Chung has asked whether we have contingency plans for air-hijacking.&nbsp; Indeed, we do.&nbsp; I will not go into the details on what precisely we would do, but, indeed, we do have such plans,&nbsp;and our air defence systems are stood up, to deal with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to have to invest in enhancing our counter-terrorism capabilities and measures.&nbsp; One example includes building up a chemical, biological, radiological and explosive (CBRE)&nbsp;&nbsp;defence group to consolidate all relevant operational expertise in&nbsp;explosives, bomb disposal, and dealing with unconventional weapons under one roof.&nbsp; So we go beyond&nbsp;just dealing with things which <p align=left>Column:1636 </p>might have already happened, but&nbsp;with things which might yet happen in the future.&nbsp; Our laboratories&nbsp;in our defence research institutions also have the capability to quickly test for and identify chemical and biological agents, as was demonstrated by the role they played in our fight against SARS just two years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ravindran has asked about Total Defence.&nbsp; I think several Members - as I looked at the subjects being raised by them -&nbsp;have also asked&nbsp;about Total Defence, and we will address that point later on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about maritime security, and so did Mr Sin&nbsp;Boon&nbsp;Ann.&nbsp; The complex nature of the new security environment is really very well reflected in the area of maritime security, particularly maritime security in the Malacca Straits.&nbsp; This is a matter of great concern for Singapore and the other littoral states - Malaysia and Indonesia -&nbsp;as well as for the user states, whose economic interests depend on secure sea lanes in this vital waterway.&nbsp; The user states, too, are important stakeholders and have a say.&nbsp; Other interested parties, such as the International Maritime Organisation and the shipping community, have also begun to focus on how security in the Malacca Straits could be enhanced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been significant progress in that there is now clear agreement among regional countries and other stakeholders that maritime threats are very real and that we all need to work together to deal with them.&nbsp; We have made considerable progress since the discussion intensified approximately a year ago.&nbsp; The Malacca and Singapore Straits has been one focus area.&nbsp; Initiatives have been undertaken in a number of multilateral arrangements.&nbsp; Singapore has just co-hosted, just a couple of days ago, together with the US, a confidence-building measure (CBM) conference on Regional Cooperation in<p align=left>Column:1637</p> Maritime Security under the ASEAN Regional Forum&nbsp;(ARF)-CBM concept.&nbsp; This brought together 170 maritime security experts from military, enforcement, port and shipping and policy agencies of the 22 ASEAN Regional Forum member countries, to discuss ways to enhance maritime security.&nbsp; The Five Power Defence Arrangements (or FPDA) has also recently expanded its focus to deal with non-conventional threats, with particular emphasis on the maritime domain.&nbsp; The&nbsp;first maritime security&nbsp;exercise was conducted last year as part of the annual major maritime security exercise.&nbsp; The 22 navies of the Western Pacific Naval Symposium have also initiated substantive professional exchanges on maritime security issues and will conduct a maritime security exercise this May.&nbsp; All these are very positive developments which enhance confidence and build capacity.&nbsp; They also create a framework of inter-operability&nbsp;that can be useful for any future contingencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At sea, we have the trilateral coordinated patrols conducted by the Indonesian,</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

The Singapore-Indonesia coordinated patrols have largely wiped out piracy incidents in the area of operations covered by these coordinated patrols since they were launched more than a decade ago.&nbsp; The trilateral coordinated patrols have also shown some early successes, although we have not been able to completely stop piracy incidents.&nbsp; But the number of piracy incidents has fallen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Piracy is&nbsp;a century-old enterprise, I might say, which will not be easily eradicated.&nbsp; Maritime terrorism is a more<p align=left>Column:1638 </p> recent scourge.&nbsp; Making the seas safe for both will require the combined efforts of many countries, and Singapore is firmly committed to this.&nbsp; We have been playing an active role in multi-lateral forums to enhance maritime security, and we will continue to do so. At the same time, we will continue to enhance the safety and security of our own port and territorial waters from terrorist threats, building on such efforts as the Container Security Initiative and the recently announced ASSet ship escort teams.&nbsp; Dealing with maritime security continues to be a work-in-progress, and we will continue our efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I note the many comments and queries on the operational readiness of the SAF.&nbsp; This has been raised by Mr Ravindran, Dr Ong Chit Chung, Dr Warren Lee, Mr Hawazi and Mr Leong Horn Kee.&nbsp; I would like to assure Members that the operational readiness of the SAF is a key priority.&nbsp; Singapore's geo-strategic situation makes us more vulnerable than most countries.&nbsp; Our small size means that we have no manoeuvring space and no strategic depth to fall back on.&nbsp; We cannot afford to sit back and absorb an attack.&nbsp; Besides having a good early warning system, it is imperative that our defence force must maintain high operational readiness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF structures its forces in a concept of tiered readiness.&nbsp; There is a high readiness core which is ready to react at very short notice to contingencies such as a terrorist attack and humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; Operation Flying Eagle, our relief mission after the Boxing Day disaster, was part of the high readiness core in action.&nbsp; Beyond this core, the SAF can call up large numbers of NS units and personnel if the situation warrants it.&nbsp; These NS units are well trained and operationally ready. Some components can be mobilised for action in&nbsp;a matter of hours while others may take a couple of days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1639 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF has designed a system to mobilise manpower, weapons, logistics supplies and civil resources at short notice.&nbsp; Singaporeans are, by now, familiar with the little green man that flashes away with our regular mobilisation exercises, which continually test and sharpen the system.&nbsp; It is testimony to the commitment of our National Servicemen that the mobilisation response rate is consistently high&nbsp;- 95% or higher.&nbsp; In all our mobilisation exercises, the called-up units were ready for action and deployment within a few hours of being activated.&nbsp; We know that when the time comes to fight, the SAF may not have a second chance&nbsp;of a&nbsp;victory.&nbsp; That drives the rigour and realism of the SAF's training.&nbsp; It is not unusual for National Servicemen responding to mobilisation calls to find themselves almost immediately thrown into some kind of battle exercise.&nbsp; Our National Servicemen know that they will be in the frontline should the SAF ever have to go to war when that little green man ever flashes for real.&nbsp; We match our national service units in exercises against active units and put them through the same strenuous and demanding training and evaluation.&nbsp; It says a lot for the spirit and commitment of our National Servicemen that they often perform just as well and, at times, even better than active units in these exercises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF is structured and trained such that any call to action will be met with an immediate and effective response.&nbsp; The SAF's operational readiness was put to a real test most recently after the Boxing Day earthquake and tsunamis hit our region.&nbsp; The SAF's reaction was a swift one, once we realised that we could make a useful contribution to the disaster relief efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members have asked for an assessment of how we did.&nbsp; I think we did very well.&nbsp; Almost immediately, plans were drawn up and preparations underway to conduct a disaster relief mission<p align=left>Column:1640</p> and, in a way which would be most useful and effective.&nbsp; The SAF could respond so quickly and effectively because we had suitable capabilities and we were operationally ready.&nbsp; Within 24 hours, the SAF had standby teams ready for deployment.&nbsp; In less than 48 hours, we had sent a C-130 transport plane with relief and medical supplies to Medan, and also a team to consult with the Indonesian authorities on how the SAF could most usefully focus its assistance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, on 29th December, an advance medical team and two Chinook helicopters were deployed to Medan.&nbsp; On day four, we sent two Super Puma medium-lift helicopters and the rest of the medical team.&nbsp; Another team of two Chinook and two Super Puma helicopters and SAF personnel was deployed to a second theatre in Phuket, Thailand.&nbsp; On day five, just 72 hours after they were activated, the first of three helicopter landing ships, the RSS Endurance, left for Sumatra, bringing with it 470 personnel in a specially assembled disaster relief team of medical, engineering, naval and communications elements, and supplies and heavy equipment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over a period of three weeks after the tsunamis, the SAF deployed to Indonesia three helicopter landing ships, which meant that 100% of our helicopter landing ships were deployed, because the fourth is currently still in the Gulf protecting the oil terminal there just off Iraq, six Chinook helicopters, two Super Pumas, two field hospitals, two engineer teams with heavy equipment, two air traffic control coordination teams, a mobile air traffic control tower, and a C-130 transport plane to ferry supplies to Indonesia.&nbsp; Altogether, about 1,200 servicemen and servicewomen were deployed in what turned out to be largest mission that the SAF had ever undertaken.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF had the right equipment for this mission but, most importantly, we <p align=left>Column:1641</p>had the right men for&nbsp;the mission&nbsp; -&nbsp; men and women with the professional competence, adaptability and dedication.&nbsp; The rigorous training they had undertaken over the years kicked in to produce a very fine execution of the mission.&nbsp; In a dynamic situation where information was often inadequate, our people were able to adapt quickly and frequently, so that they produced the results to make the mission a resounding success.&nbsp; And among those people were some National Servicemen&nbsp; -&nbsp; NSFs,&nbsp;NSmen and volunteers - who brought credit to the SAF with their professionalism and hard work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While our servicemen and women did us proud, at the individual level, the sum proved to be even more than the parts.&nbsp; The medic in the Banda Aceh field hospital or the Chinook pilot in the air over Medan, or the naval diver on a helicopter landing ship on the coast of&nbsp;Meulaboh were physically far apart&nbsp; -&nbsp; hundreds of miles apart, and hundreds of miles from Singapore&nbsp; -&nbsp; but they operated as part of an integrated tri-service force.&nbsp; The effective execution of this mission demonstrated how far the SAF has come in its development as a joint force.&nbsp; It also demonstrated the effectiveness of our system-wide response, by which I mean&nbsp;not just&nbsp;the combined effort of the SAF men and women deployed in theatre, but also the technology and support groups in MINDEF, our industry partners and civil resource partners.&nbsp; All these components were tied together by a rigorous planning process and a tight decision-making loop.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mission also demonstrated that the current training of our officers does equip them to work with international agencies, NGOs and the media.&nbsp; But we learnt some lessons as well, and the SAF will take the lessons learnt in these areas to further improve the training of our officers.&nbsp; This was the point that was raised by Dr Warren Lee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1642</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operation Flying Eagle was a good test of our response system.&nbsp; The results affirmed that the resources and effort we have put into enhancing the SAF's operational readiness and&nbsp;enhancing our integration as a joint tri-service force have been the right investments.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chay Wai Chuen, Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Sin Boon Ann and Ms Irene Ng have asked whether the SAF should now redesign itself so that it can respond more quickly for humanitarian missions and whether the SAF should extend its capabilities to conduct non-military international operations such as peacekeeping; in other words, to refocus the SAF.&nbsp; Sir, let me state quite clearly that the primary mission of the SAF must be to defend Singapore and enhance Singapore's security.&nbsp; Our security is the top priority.&nbsp; It is the reason why we have the SAF.&nbsp; It always has been, and it will long be so, given our particular strategic circumstances.&nbsp; And that is the mission that the SAF must focus on.&nbsp; That means the SAF has to be structured and developed primarily to meet the range of potential threats to our security - from an assault on our sovereignty and territorial integrity, to dealing with low-intensity conflicts, to fighting terrorism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the SAF safeguards our national security, we are also conscious of our obligations as a responsible member of the international community and as a good neighbour and friend.&nbsp; Hence, we have made our contributions where SAF's capabilities could be useful, eg, humanitarian assistance disaster relief missions.&nbsp; These have included disaster relief operations following earthquakes in Indonesia, India and other regional countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The SAF has also participated in UN and other peacekeeping operations, contributing about 1,500 SAF personnel to 14 missions over the years.&nbsp; Members will recall that the SAF participated in three successive multi-national missions in<p align=left>Column:1643</p> East Timor with combat peacekeepers, not just logistics and medical support.&nbsp; We also had medical teams, of course, and headquarters staff, and an SAF officer, BG Tan Huck Gim, who was Force Commander of UNMISET.&nbsp; The UN knows that Singapore is unable to contribute large numbers of troops, but they do appreciate that we contribute in areas where we have niche capabilities and that we do well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The UN's appointment of an SAF officer to lead the peacekeeping force in East Timor was testimony to the regard that the UN has for the SAF's professionalism.<B>&nbsp;</B> The Singapore Government will continue to contribute towards such international operations and disaster relief efforts where we find that the SAF's capabilities could be useful and where it is appropriate for the SAF to play a role.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Our recent experience in Aceh highlighted two things - military assets and military personnel are highly flexible and indeed can be used in humanitarian missions.&nbsp; Our LSTs, transport planes, heavy-lift helicopters and heavy machinery were of high value when they were the only things that could access the disaster zone speedily and quickly.&nbsp; Our search and rescue teams, combat engineers, naval divers and pilots were of high value when the tasks required their professional skills and when no one else could do them.&nbsp; But they are also not always the best for such missions nor should they be designed to be so.&nbsp; Once the emergency relief phase was over, international organisations such as the United Nations and NGOs, such as the Red Cross and our own Mercy Relief, had more relevant skills and experience.&nbsp; We should appreciate and understand this and, in fact, we should welcome this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mr Ravindran has raised the point about defence diplomacy.&nbsp; It has long been the focus of MINDEF to build friendship and generally develop a network of good relations with our<p align=left>Column:1644 </p> ASEAN partners and friends further afield, for this enhances our security.&nbsp; The mutual understanding that grows out of increased interactions reduces the risk of misconceptions and miscalculations and enables more substantive and effective cooperation when that is called for.&nbsp; The friendship that the SAF has cultivated</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

The training tempo is high.&nbsp;Members may not realise how&nbsp;frequently we train with other countries.&nbsp; Last year,&nbsp;the SAF conducted about 70 exercises with over 20 armed forces, that is, an average of nearly 1.4 exercises per week&nbsp;with other countries.&nbsp; They are both bilateral and multilateral exercises.&nbsp; All three SAF services - the Army, Navy and Air Force - exercise with their foreign counterparts.&nbsp; The overseas exercises&nbsp;allow the SAF to train in a&nbsp;wide variety of challenging and realistic operating environments, as well&nbsp;as to benchmark itself against other armed forces.&nbsp; And as&nbsp;some Members asked,&nbsp;the SAF generally&nbsp;does do quite well.&nbsp; Such exposure helps sharpen our professional skills and operational readiness.&nbsp; For the SAF, the training access that has been offered by so many of our friends has been of great value, given our land and airspace limitations.&nbsp; Today, the SAF trains in almost a dozen countries on a regular basis.&nbsp; Defence diplomacy has also helped us to secure defence technology collaboration with a number of countries with advanced defence technology, including the US, France, Israel and Sweden.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MINDEF and the SAF will continue to work on expanding our circle of friends<p align=left>Column:1645 </p> while strengthening each valuable relationship that we have.&nbsp; In my recent travels, I found considerable interest in engaging Singapore and the SAF.&nbsp; In Japan, for instance, I had a substantive dialogue with Japanese leaders on several security issues which reflected considerable common perspectives and a potential for more interactions and deeper engagement.&nbsp; I was recently in Bahrain, and there was also an interest in&nbsp;increasing defence&nbsp;interactions with Singapore.&nbsp; I shall be going to India shortly, in two weeks' time.&nbsp; Singapore and India signed a defence cooperation agreement in 2003&nbsp;to underscore the commitment of both sides to strengthen defence cooperation.&nbsp; I look forward to discussing with my counterpart there on&nbsp;how we can expand our cooperation further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MINDEF and the SAF will continue to place a premium on maintaining a high state of operational readiness and expanding our international ties through defence diplomacy.&nbsp; The evolving security environment and changing nature of warfare demand that we develop our other capabilities that leverage on technology so that we remain prepared and will continue to have high operational readiness in the years ahead -&nbsp;5, 10, 15 or&nbsp;20 years.&nbsp; More than ever before, we need to equip ourselves with military capabilities that can respond to a complex and unpredictable security environment with flexibility and innovation. To prepare for the future, MINDEF and the SAF are on a journey to transform our military forces into the third generation (3G) SAF.&nbsp; Dr Ong, Dr Warren Lee and Mr Leong Horn Kee have asked about these transformation efforts.&nbsp; This journey has many dimensions.&nbsp; These include developing new operating concepts, reshaping the force structure and developing our people.&nbsp; MINDEF has developed a blueprint and action schedule for the<p align=left>Column:1646</p> development of the 3G SAF.&nbsp;This includes the sorts of capabilities that Dr Warren Lee asked about, for dealing with urban warfare,&nbsp;terrorism and asymmetric warfare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we crystallise the developmental framework for the 3G SAF, we are conducting parallel efforts to experiment with new technologies and test prototype systems in field exercises.&nbsp; For example, during a recent SAF&nbsp;exercise conducted in Australia, we deployed a prototype lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV, which DSO National Laboratories&nbsp;had developed.&nbsp; The UAV was able to provide live video of the opposing force to our troops on the ground so that troops at the lowest tactical level could see clearly how the enemy was deployed and track their movement in real time.&nbsp; With this significant advantage, our force's decision cycles were shortened and simulated weapons were delivered to the targets in a timely manner and with great accuracy.&nbsp; In the same exercise, the SAF adapted commercial off-the-shelf wireless technology to allow the operational headquarters, which is usually a large and unwieldy collection of people,&nbsp;vehicles and communications, to be dispersed.&nbsp; Headquarters, as&nbsp;Members know,&nbsp;are high value assets&nbsp;and by dispersing the&nbsp;HQ over a large area, we could reduce&nbsp;its signature and vulnerability to enemy detection and attack and, also, speed up the rate at which it can be redeployed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have deployed some of the 3G SAF capabilities in actual operations.&nbsp; In the operation in Aceh, the SAF deployed high bandwidth communications in the different locations in Aceh.&nbsp; These systems were adapted from the Defence Science and Technology Agency and industry at short notice.&nbsp; The high bandwidth satellite communications significantly enhance the SAF's command and control capability.&nbsp; Operational discussions were conducted through video conferencing in real time, and this enabled <p align=left>Column:1647 </p>the SAF to respond quickly to the operational requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the 3G SAF will be a more&nbsp;formidable and operationally ready force that is enhanced by technology, it will always be the soldier,&nbsp;sailor and airman who will ultimately make the difference.&nbsp; Fundamental to the 3G SAF soldiers are the values that are imbued in generations of the SAF -&nbsp;loyalty, commitment, courage, professionalism.&nbsp; The 3G SAF soldier will also be developed to be professionally and technically competent to operate and exploit the full capabilities of the new weapons and systems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong has asked whether our soldiers, especially our National Servicemen, are capable of doing this.&nbsp; We are fortunate that we have a technically literate population, both of National Servicemen and operationally ready National Servicemen, and they are very highly motivated to learn new things.&nbsp;We have no difficulty with them.&nbsp; Overall, the development of the 3G SAF soldier is&nbsp;a key component of the transformation of the SAF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government has been unwavering in giving defence expenditure the highest priority.&nbsp; We have given our commitment that MINDEF can spend up to 6% of our GDP each year on defence.&nbsp; We have been spending between 4.5% and 5% over the past few years.&nbsp; This steadfast and prudent approach has served us well.&nbsp; We are able to take a long-term view of our defence needs and force planning and build a defence capability that gives us the best value for the resources that we have invested.&nbsp; As a result, we have a defence force capable of meeting its mission, which is to deter aggression&nbsp;and to secure a swift and decisive victory should deterrence and diplomacy fail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;a technical matter, Mr Chay Wai Chuen asked why our operating expenditure has gone up.&nbsp; I should explain <p align=left>Column:1648 </p>that the operating expenditure reflected in the Budget book reflects the total expenditure on the SAF which includes, what you normally call, \"operating expenditure\", but it also includes things like training,&nbsp;pay and emoluments for SAF servicemen and reservists, as well as capital expenditure on the SAF.&nbsp;So it is not just all operating expenditure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Ivan Png asked how MINDEF would change its expenditure should the budget be raised or cut by 5%.&nbsp; MINDEF takes a very careful and considered approach in drawing up the defence budget and we would not spend more money just because&nbsp;money is available.&nbsp; Similarly, we would not cut spending hastily so that the capabilities and operational readiness of the SAF are compromised.&nbsp; MINDEF's budget is drawn up based on what is needed to enable the SAF to carry out its core mission of defending our nation in the current situation and, also, in the years to come.&nbsp; MINDEF's budget is put through a rigorous process and scrutiny every year.&nbsp; Priorities are established by the joint staff in conjunction with the services in a&nbsp;process where the different planning agencies test their plans and ideas against each other.&nbsp; So, there is always a contest of ideas, and this 5% up or&nbsp;5% down question is&nbsp;continually being asked, not just on the total defence budget but parts of the defence budget.&nbsp;The budget plans and priorities are again scrutinised by MINDEF staff before they are approved each year.&nbsp; But beyond assessing the question of what MINDEF would do with the budget at the margin -&nbsp;5% more or&nbsp;5% less - at least once every five years, MINDEF carries out a thorough review and reassessment of our long-term force structure needs.&nbsp; So it is more than a 5% either way kind of assessment, but a fundamental rethink of what we would need for our defence in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The transformation to the 3G SAF is the outcome of the most recent such<p align=left>Column:1649 </p> review.&nbsp; To actualise the 3G SAF, MINDEF has created&nbsp;various structures and processes to ensure that we are able to explore new ideas and concepts and are not trapped in conventional thinking&nbsp;that may no longer be relevant.&nbsp; For example, we now have a separate group, called the Future Systems Directorate, to challenge the conventional wisdom, and to study and test new operational concepts and systems that will give the 3G SAF a quantum improvement in capability to operate&nbsp;in a completely different way.&nbsp; The 3G SAF will involve a fundamental and far-reaching transformation of the SAF in the coming decade, and building the 3G SAF is the major focus of our defence expenditure in the coming years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, we will&nbsp;continue to ensure that we extract the best value for money for our ongoing programmes.&nbsp; Dr Ong asked about the progress of the Next&nbsp;Fighter Replacement&nbsp;Programme.&nbsp; Some Members of the House might have read in the last&nbsp;day or so, reports in the media&nbsp;about how some&nbsp;of the suppliers found Singapore's tender one of the hardest that they have had to work on.&nbsp;This shows how, as is MINDEF's usual practice, we are very thorough with our evaluation and how we make sure that the aircraft that is eventually selected will give the RSAF an edge, and delivers the most combat power for money over the aircraft's life cycle.&nbsp;There have been some media reports, also, that we have delayed the programme.&nbsp; This is incorrect.&nbsp; But our robust and thorough evaluation means that we have not awarded the contract as quickly as some might have hoped for.&nbsp; We are not in a hurry.&nbsp; We are coming to a final decision over the next few months.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would, therefore, like to assure Mr Chay and Prof. Png that MINDEF places heavy emphasis on cost effectiveness and maximising our defence capability from<p align=left>Column:1650 </p> each defence dollar, not just in the immediate timeframe, but also in the long term.&nbsp; Prof. Png has also asked for comparisons between Singapore's defence expenditure and those of a range of similarly sized countries. &nbsp;From a purely&nbsp;numerical point of view, an analysis of the numbers along the lines that Prof. Png has requested is not difficult to do.&nbsp; All one needs is a calculator and a copy of The Military Balance -&nbsp;an annual publication of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bald numbers are there.&nbsp; But the point is that such numerical comparisons on their own are not particularly useful.&nbsp; These countries are a diverse lot.&nbsp; Some have not faced any serious threat or conflict for decades, others live in constant fear of invasion; some have mountains or large tracts of land to buffer them, others have little or no strategic depth; some believe in being self-sufficient and providing for their own defence,&nbsp;others have decided to place their defence and, hence, the fate of their countries in the hands of others.&nbsp; So there are many different strategies and approaches that different countries take to their defence needs and how they provide for them.&nbsp; So a bald comparison of the numbers really is not particularly instructive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many pertinent factors to consider, including history, geography, demography.&nbsp; What is important for us to know is that we have decided that we must provide for our defence, for if we are not prepared to defend ourselves, we cannot expect anyone else to do so on our behalf.&nbsp; This is a bitter lesson that our fathers and grandfathers learned in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing for our own defence allows us to chart our own course as an independent sovereign nation, without having to buckle under pressure from larger states, or to become subservient to their strategic imperatives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the SAF's work in Operation Flying Eagle demonstrated its operational<p align=left>Column:1651 </p> readiness and its ability to respond effectively when the need arises.&nbsp; The sustained attention&nbsp;to operational readiness and capability development for the long term, the ongoing build-up of our network of defence relations -&nbsp;these must continue to be the focus of MINDEF and the SAF.&nbsp; Beyond these current requirements,&nbsp;the long term planning and force structuring are just as important if we are to have a defence capability to ensure Singapore's security into the future and continue to give our people and foreign investors confidence.&nbsp; We must always make sure that our investments in defence</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

In this book, which is a collection of essays from one of the previous year's Chief of Army's essay competitions, servicemen, both NS and regular from the rank-and-file up to General Staff level, related incidents and encounters during their time as citizen soldiers that have shaped their lives and beliefs, and their ideas of&nbsp;what it means to be a leader and what it means to be a Singaporean.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an excellent book.&nbsp; It actually contains very inspiring accounts by people who had chased robbers, even a PES-E serviceman clerk, commandos <p align=left>Column:1654 </p>and so on.&nbsp; And it underlines what the Minister has just told the House earlier that, at the end of the day, it is the soldier on the ground that makes the difference.&nbsp; This confirms what I have always held dear, that the NS experience is really&nbsp;very, very important in terms of our nation-building.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I think we also do have another group of memorable moments that some of our soldiers would rather forget, although some actually do wear these moments with pride.&nbsp; This refers to the recent case of deaths during unauthorised training.&nbsp; After those reports came out in the newspapers, some other NSmen recounted to me that they too had either experienced or witnessed instances of unauthorised training methods and punishments.&nbsp; These just never made the news.&nbsp; I was glad that many of these incidents were recounted as being of the distant past, and I was very happy that there were no recent incidents recounted.&nbsp; Yet, perhaps, our citizens would like to be reassured that the SAF of today is serious about training, but also takes good care of its citizen soldiers by modern methods of risk management and risk mitigation, so that training is both realistic and as safe as it can be, given the nature of the tasks at hand.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another topic that somehow refuses to go away is also the doubts that still exist in the minds of some Singaporeans regarding the treatment of soldiers classified as being \"White Horse\".&nbsp; Sir, Singaporeans are so used to the fact that in Singapore you do your National Service, whether or not you are the son of the rich and powerful, that we often do not realise that our egalitarian system is not that common around the world.&nbsp; In this respect, perhaps we are more akin to maybe the British tradition where the sons of the royal houses have taken great pride&nbsp;in doing their share in the armed services.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As a highly professional body charged with the heavy responsibility of training our young citizens in the defence of our country, the SAF must continually ensure the safety of our NSmen during their training.&nbsp; In a way, it is, if I may say so, fortunate that major incidents like the dunking incident and the accident involving the RSN Courageous are probably few and far between.&nbsp; Nevertheless, one high profile incident, even if it is a rare one, is enough to send the chills down the spines of servicemen and their parents.&nbsp; Still, there have been other incidents in past years, whether due to human error or faulty equipment, to merit this ever lingering concern.&nbsp; One single life lost, as we all know, is a loss not just to the families but as well as for the nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the three training-related deaths last year, the SAF set up the 24-hour safety hotline.&nbsp; This is a welcome move.&nbsp; I understand that there have, however, not been many calls to this<p align=left>Column:1656 </p> hotline.&nbsp; It means probably that, by and large, there are not too many safety issues in the SAF.&nbsp; But we need to encourage the servicemen to report safety breaches without fear of upsetting their superiors.&nbsp; We need to assure all servicemen that all such feedback will be investigated in an open and transparent way without fear of reprisal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a way, training safety is a thorny issue.&nbsp; We must ensure no harm befall our servicemen, yet we cannot compromise on standards of training.&nbsp; We need to push our men to the limit so that they know what it is like to operate in a hostile environment.&nbsp; Their endurance and resistance to difficult and dangerous environment have to be tested so that they become good and tough soldiers as well as strong leaders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the SAF can take two measures to ensure safety.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, it must be vigilant in its audit of training procedures to ensure proper compliance.&nbsp; Sir, the investigation into the dunking incident last year revealed that serious deviations from proper training measures had in fact taken place for some time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, the SAF must ensure that instructors and those supervising them are properly selected and are fully aware of their responsibilities, have the right skills and, most importantly, the right psyche to train our servicemen.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would, therefore, like to urge the Minister to continue to assure all NSmen and their families that safety is always a priority in their training.</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The review affirmed that we had a strong system to support <p align=left>Column:1658 </p>training in terms of robust safety structures, processes and procedures.&nbsp; But we also recognised that a strong safety culture is very important if the safety system is to be effective.&nbsp; Hence, a key focus area of the SAF's efforts to improve training safety has been to foster a safety culture, with an emphasis on openness and command responsibility. Safety hotlines have been installed in all three services to encourage feedback, as Mr Tan Soo Khoon has reminded us. We also thoroughly investigate not only accidents but also near-accidents.&nbsp; The requirement to report and analyse all such incidents - actual accidents and&nbsp;near-accidents - sustains safety awareness and fosters the safety culture we want in the SAF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an ingrained safety consciousness that we want to develop in all our commanders and men.&nbsp; It has to go beyond merely complying with safety regulations and doing safety checks.&nbsp; Sir, we spoke about Operation Flying Eagle earlier.&nbsp; The SAF was deployed for over two months. We had 1,200 men and women operating on the ground, in the air and at sea, often in challenging conditions and at a high operational tempo, mounting quite complex operations.&nbsp; I am glad to say that there was a strong safety culture at work and no one sustained an injury more serious than a dislocated shoulder and none of our vehicles, ships or aircraft was involved in any accident.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I had reported last March that the SAF had stepped up senior commander visits and audits by the service inspectorates, and that the Army, Navy and Air Force would also be reinforcing their inspectorates and safety sections with more staff.&nbsp; I also told Members that the SAF would benchmark its safety standards against those of other armed forces and look into engaging external safety auditors to further improve training safety.&nbsp; I would like to update Members on developments in these areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column:1659 </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF has brought more staff into the service inspectorate teams, and these teams now conduct more frequent audits on units all year round and they do include surprise checks.&nbsp; There is now more timely identification of trends and prompt intervention and analysis, and the lessons learnt are proliferated across SAF formations, through seminars, briefings, publications and so forth.&nbsp; SAF formations have also been boosted with the introduction of Formation Safety Warrant Officers, who have&nbsp;vast training experience and can share their knowledge of safety and risk management with younger ground commanders.&nbsp; This also gives Formation&nbsp;Commanders more capacity to raise the level of training audits and conduct more inspections of ground units.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Warren Lee has asked about whether we use scientific methods for injury prevention and for making sure that our training is progressive. The SAF closely tracks all matters related to training injuries.&nbsp; I give you an example, say, from&nbsp;heat injury.&nbsp; Whenever there is a hot spell, G6-Army will send out a Training Instruction&nbsp;to all units to remind ground commanders to be more vigilant for heat injury symptoms and to follow the&nbsp;hydration regime closely.&nbsp; The higher awareness&nbsp;of heat disorders and knowledge of measures&nbsp;to prevent them led to a marked reduction of SAF&nbsp;heat injury cases in the first half of work year 2004/2005 compared to the corresponding period in the previous work year.&nbsp; The number of cases went down from 25 to nine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Army has also carried out a series of benchmarking exercises to compare and learn from the best practices of its sister services and foreign armed forces. For example, the Army has been looking at physical fitness training and how to make physical fitness training more progressive for many, many years.&nbsp; The latest of these efforts -&nbsp;the Army sent a <p align=left>Column:1660 </p>study team which visited the US Army Physical Fitness School last year and they found that their programme for raising the physical fitness of their recruits was progressive, scientific and holistic.&nbsp; The Army used this as a basis to conduct a three-month trial in 3SIR and found it effective in lowering training injuries while maintaining a high physical fitness standard for our recruits.&nbsp; The PT for recruits has since been modified along these lines.&nbsp; And as Mr Tan and others have pointed out, this is very important because we do not have very many people. And if we lose people to injuries, we also lose them for training and we are unable to develop them and train them as well as we can during the short period of full-time national service that we have.&nbsp; And also if we recall them back for ICTs and they become injured, they are also unable to complete their ICTs if they are unable to recover from their injuries in time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To improve its safety management system, the Army sent the General Staff Inspectorate (GSI) to visit the UK's Army Land Accident Prevention and Investigation Team to benchmark against its safety practices.&nbsp; The GSI will shortly also be visiting the&nbsp; Australian Army's safety establishment. Such exchanges help raise the awareness and professionalism of our safety practitioners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Warren Lee has asked about whether the training, posting, risks and opportunities during National Service are the same for everyone, regardless of his family background.&nbsp; Mr Chairman, this is indeed so, and there can be no other way of doing this in our SAF. The SAF is our army, it is a citizen army, and the training, posting, risks and opportunities for NS soldiers are there for everyone to see.&nbsp; There is nothing to hide and you cannot hide it.&nbsp; The commanders see it, their colleagues and their peers see it, and their subordinates see it.&nbsp; If the system was not fair, open and above board, and <p align=left>Column:1661 </p>meritocratic, support for National Service would soon evaporate and would have long evaporated.&nbsp; That support for NS remains high even after more than three decades is proof itself that the integrity of the system has been maintained.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is important to remember that the SAF has to train&nbsp;our people as they will fight. We will not let up on hard and realistic training, for the harder and more realistically we train our men, the more likely they are to fight well and survive on the battlefield. The training must also be conducted professionally and safely.&nbsp; MINDEF therefore constantly aims to strike the right balance between training realism and safety.&nbsp; The SAF takes all the safety precautions and measures feasible to minimise risks. We expect the highest level of professionalism from our officers and men when they conduct training.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, parents entrust their sons to the SAF to prepare and train them to perform a national duty in the defence of Singapore. This is&nbsp;a heavy responsibility that MINDEF and the SAF do not take lightly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to assure all Members that we will not compromise on safety.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lily Neo:</B> Mr Chairman, may I ask the Minister whether the deceased SAF servicemen's families will be compensated for the loss of their children during training in SAF?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, yes, they are.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ravindran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><I>Defence Technology and Industry</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Ravindran</B>:&nbsp; Sir, when the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) was set up, one of the concerns that I highlighted was who would audit the DSTA.&nbsp; The House was given the assurance that the committee that oversees the DSTA will report to a <p align=left>Column:1662 </p>committee headed&nbsp;by the Prime Minister, and I was satisfied with the answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But what I would like to&nbsp;share with the House today is that DSTA must have done a lot of research and development&nbsp;(R&amp;D) work, and I would like to ask the Minister, firstly,&nbsp;whether he is satisfied with the achievements of the DSTA over the last three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly,&nbsp;with regard to some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;projects that have been undertaken by the DSTA, have they developed to a stage where some of them can be commercialised, so that we not only develop a&nbsp;technology that is&nbsp;merely kept within the military, but is also shared with the commercial world.&nbsp;&nbsp;And something that can be commercialised will mean that it can also bring some revenue to DSTA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third question&nbsp;that I would like to ask the Minister is whether there is an exchange of ideas and research with the educational institutions and businesses, not only locally but also with other countries which have similar facilities in research and development in the military field.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Warren Lee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Warren Lee:</B> Sir, Singapore seems to have a multitude of agencies and institutes loosely connected with our Armed Forces, such as Singapore Technologies' group of companies, our local defence industries, Defence Science and Technology Agency and Defence Medical Research Institute (DMRI).&nbsp; How do these agencies contribute to our total defence effort?

Besides developing capabilities in conventional warfare, we must also identify new and suitable defence technologies to strengthen our non-conventional warfare capabilities.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, terrorist, chemical and biological threats will pose new challenges for us to overcome these threats in our built environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, defence technology has become increasingly important in strengthening our defence capabilities.&nbsp; Sir, with the rapid urbanisation of cities, the use of technology for fighting in built-up environment will play a more significant role in the future. Therefore, we must enhance our built-up defence or fighting capabilities by introducing advanced communications systems, thermal scanners, laser tracers or precision weapons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as Singapore apportions a sizeable proportion of our budget for defence, we need to apportion carefully our investment <p align=left>Column:1664</p>in defence technology for both conventional and non-conventional threats.&nbsp; Ideally, we should invest in technology that will prepare us for conventional, non-conventional threats as well as relief operations during peacetime.&nbsp; One good example is the use of helicopters with different fighting capabilities and carrying capacities that allow flexible deployment in all situations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another example will be the use of naval ships for waterways defence as well as sea surveillance or relief operations. Even simple technology like the thermal and radiographic scanners can serve as a line of defence against SARS or disease outbreak and, at the same time, they can be used commercially to prevent human and goods trafficking.&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, conventional and non-conventional threats have created more opportunities for the use of technology in different situations, thus increasing the commercial viability of defence technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, today, defence technology, such as communications system, information system, electronic system, remote control system and radar system, can be commercially applied in various business operations.&nbsp; Thus, there are lots of potential to develop&nbsp;the defence technology industry in Singapore.&nbsp; But we must first attract a critical pool of talent to conduct R&amp;D in defence technology.&nbsp; More scholarships should be awarded to encourage more Singaporeans to join our defence science organisations and Defence Science Technology Agency.&nbsp; We should also allocate more resources to spearhead strategic defence technology's R&amp;D projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we must provide more flexibility to market non-sensitive defence technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to seek the following clarifications from the Ministry:&nbsp; first, how does MINDEF adopt various technologies to further enhance our defence capabilities? Second, what are the R&amp;D <p align=left>Column:1665 </p>efforts and achievements in defence technology?</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

Mr Chairman, Sir, the Minister spoke earlier about the rigorous selection of our next generation fighters for the SAF.&nbsp; I wonder whether MINDEF would ask for industrial cooperation in the procurement of its next generation fighters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MINDEF used to include industrial cooperation in its defence procurement in the past.&nbsp; Suddenly, several years earlier, it seems to have abandoned the practice altogether.&nbsp; I understand MINDEF's position is that offset is a very expensive way of paying for something that is not very useful.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how did MINDEF come to this conclusion.&nbsp; What were the lessons learned by MINDEF?&nbsp; Has MINDEF studied how other&nbsp;developed nations, such as UK, Belgium and Finland, practise their offset programme?&nbsp; And if our experience has been poor,&nbsp;perhaps it could be that we have not learned the trick of the trade.&nbsp; From the table I circulated earlier,&nbsp;Sir, it seems that some of these countries manage to leverage $1 of offset for every dollar spent with an incremental cost of only 3%.&nbsp; From a national perspective, it might be argued that it is really worthwhile to impose offset on major weapon procurement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the other countries that practised offset, offset benefit programmes are extended to the whole economy, including products and services from the domestic economy.&nbsp; In the advanced countries, with&nbsp;a long history, their Ministry of Defence is the lead agency, and in those nations, <I>quid pro <p align=left>Column:1666 </p>quo</I> has always been the norm.&nbsp; For others, the lead agency tends to&nbsp;be the one involved in economic activities.&nbsp; For instance, in the Netherlands, it is the Ministry of Economics, in Finland it is the Ministry of Trade and Industry.&nbsp; If MINDEF has found it unable to gain much out of industrial cooperation, did it work with other economic agencies of our Government in the past, to leverage its huge defence procurement?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the upcoming procurement of the next generation fighters, I believe the F15 is one of the candidate fighter planes.&nbsp; I understand that South Korea has&nbsp;also recently concluded a fighter vendor selection, and the tie-breaker in that selection, in favour of the winner, the F15K, was, indeed, the offset programme offered by Boeing.&nbsp; Sir, we are spending a substantial amount of our national budget acquiring this next generation fighter.&nbsp; If through offset we could create a flowback to the local economy, it would be a great benefit for our economy, which is at the moment sputtering only on a few engines, and not all engines are firing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand, Sir, that it is not the role of MINDEF to look out for economic problems in our nation in its weapon procurement.&nbsp; Its job is actually, as the Minister said, to get the best weapon at the cheapest possible price.&nbsp; However, MINDEF's expenditure is a high percentage of our budget, and is close to 5% of GDP.&nbsp; If there is a chance that offset could help, I think it is only appropriate that the Minister takes into consideration the benefit of such a programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With structural unemployment becoming ever difficult to solve, I am making a plea that the Minister considers using this programme to help to create some flowback.&nbsp; My question to the Minister is whether MINDEF would explore the use of the offset, together with MTI and MOF, in the upcoming <p align=left>Column:1667 </p>tender for the next generation fighters, if the incremental cost of a properly structured offset programme is, indeed, only 3% for a cost-benefit ratio of one, as claimed by some offset experts.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And we had done it proudly.&nbsp; Like any Singaporean parent, I found National Service to be a good exposure and experience for my son.&nbsp; He had the opportunity to live and work closely with his fellow NSmen and underwent physical endurance regimes which toughened his body and soul.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it could not be denied that NSF is a sacrifice, though a necessary sacrifice, of some two years of a person's life for the country.&nbsp; Therefore, we are very pleased that the Defence Minister announced the cutting short of NSF period for corporals and above, from 2 1/2 years to&nbsp;two years.&nbsp; I wish to ask the Defence Minister: &nbsp;what has been the experience of the SAF with the shorter NSF period?&nbsp; Do the&nbsp;two years of full-time training period provide sufficient time for adequate training of SAF officers or specialists?&nbsp; In addition, has the implementation of the 3G SAF progressed well?&nbsp; What has the SAF done to deploy better weaponry so as to enable our soldiers to be more effective as a fighting force?&nbsp; What are the new initiatives that would enable SAF NSmen to be a more potent combat unit?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the shortening of the half year for the NSF period,&nbsp;our NSmen, who are seeking to enter tertiary education, would save at least half year of their life.&nbsp; Hence, I wish to ask the Minister whether his Ministry has been able to coordinate with the Ministry of Education such that the shorter half year of NS obligation could be converted into an earlier entry to the tertiary education.&nbsp; For example, now the \"A\" level students finish their <p align=left>Column:1668 </p>examinations in November, but the universities, for example, NTU, only starts in July.&nbsp; So there is a gap of at least 6-8 months before they could enter the university if they do a full-time two-year National Service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister to be more liberal to allow NSmen early disruption of their NS for, say, up to three months, if they have to obtain entry into a local or overseas university.&nbsp; This would enable them to save up to nine months of waiting time for the next academic term.&nbsp; If they are allowed to have early disruption, they could return to complete their NS&nbsp;obligation during their vacations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister would consider these suggestions.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</B> Sir, with globalisation, many Singaporeans are travelling more, and&nbsp;some even residing longer in the countries where they do business.&nbsp; So we could see many of our Singaporeans staying in Australia, the States and&nbsp;some even in China.&nbsp; They bring along their families, if their postings are long.&nbsp; And, if the children are doing their secondary or post-secondary education, they very likely would enter the overseas universities as well.&nbsp; Now, this is where the question of NS would affect their choice -&nbsp;whether to return home, or&nbsp;to stay there and continue their tertiary education.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, if these overseas children enter the university, before the age of 17 1/2 years, then it is not a problem.&nbsp; But, sometimes, some students exceed the 17 1/2 years and are asked to come back to do NS.&nbsp; These students are prepared to do their NS after their university.&nbsp; Yet, their request for deferment cannot be acceded by MINDEF.&nbsp; So parents forgo their NS deposit to let their children continue to study.&nbsp; When the young graduate returns, he has to face MINDEF for not enlisting.&nbsp; Now, some choose not to come back for<p align=left>Column:1669</p> fear of going to jail and, thus, we lose a few good Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the light of so many Singaporeans going overseas for work, and staying for some, I ask MINDEF to be more flexible in allowing deferment for some of these students.&nbsp; MINDEF insists that the students must be already studying at the university when he turns 17 1/2 years.&nbsp; An acceptance letter from the university is not sufficient for him to get deferment.&nbsp; If he is accepted to enter a university, he must be physically present in the university.&nbsp; Now, if the term starts, for example, when he is over 17 1/2 years, he would not get a deferment.&nbsp; If we continue to stick stubbornly to this administrative requirement, then we would lose some Singaporeans.&nbsp; And, if the attitude is that it is only a few, then we have to be very careful, because we have to ask ourselves whether we are prepared to trade-in these good Singaporeans with the less capable people entering into Singapore via&nbsp;our&nbsp;immigration policy.&nbsp; In other words, you are trading quantity for quality.&nbsp; So I call for a rethink on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another category of deferment I am asking MINDEF to consider is somewhat similar to the above, except this time it involves a graduate who wants to do a Masters or a Ph.D.&nbsp; Many of our Singaporean students do well;&nbsp;however, some exceptionally well, and they are usually offered by the university to continue to do their Masters or even their Ph.D.&nbsp; But, again, this is not allowed by MINDEF.&nbsp; Unless these students are very special, MINDEF does not give an exemption.&nbsp; So I would like to ask who are these people who are given exemption, because Singaporeans are always calling for fairness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of people&nbsp;that are given the opportunity by the university to do Masters, I do not think is very big.&nbsp; It<p align=left>Column:1670</p> must be quite small.&nbsp; But these are the very students we want them back.&nbsp; It is very simple.&nbsp; They are very bright students and, therefore, we should try to retain them.&nbsp; Some suggested to me that they should ask MINDEF to up the NS deposit.&nbsp; But I think that is not the right thing to do.&nbsp; I am thinking, if&nbsp;MINDEF softens&nbsp;its stand on this, the trade-off is goodwill and trust.&nbsp; Trust our people, do not prejudge,&nbsp;be less suspicious - and I am sure these students would return to do their NS.&nbsp; So I am asking the Minister to consider my request for deferment for some of these students.</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chay Wai Chuen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The SAF has provided a silent and effective deterrent to any potential aggressor.&nbsp; I think our capabilities have been well exemplified in the recent Aceh tsunami.&nbsp; But less discernible values are&nbsp;also the changes in the attractiveness of the SAF, in the sense that there is an increasing desirability of our sons in wanting to become officers.&nbsp; Operational readiness requires many important things to come together well - technology deployment, adequate training, proper <p align=left>Column:1671</p>doctrine, assessment of threat, good public acceptance of National Service, proper administration and the symbiotic relationship, professional relationship between the regular cadre and National Servicemen.&nbsp;

My question is:&nbsp; have some of these new challenges created a situation where MINDEF has to pay attention and study the possible changes in attitudes to our young men and, if so, what are those results?&nbsp; SAF has definitely become a more flexible operationally ready fighting force and, in some cases, also a non-fighting force.&nbsp; This requires more training.&nbsp; In fact, with the deployment of more sophisticated systems, training needs to be more integrated.&nbsp; I think the Minister earlier had said that in many situations, the reserve force performs just as well, if not, better than the NS units.&nbsp; So, the question is:&nbsp; what is MINDEF doing to address this possibility of the need for more training, and would the <p align=left>Column:1672 </p>shortened NS liability require more talented NSmen to volunteer beyond statutory requirement?</p><p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;
