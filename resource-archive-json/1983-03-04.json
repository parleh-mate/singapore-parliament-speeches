The Government's policy is to encourage the efforts of the voluntary organizations which are running the special schools and to support them wherever possible. The Ministry of Education has been providing teachers to teach in the eight special schools. Similarly, the Ministry of Social Affairs has been providing instructors for the School for the Blind and the School for the Deaf. In addition, the Ministries of Social Affairs and Health give annual grants to the special schools to meet part of their recurrent expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, 69 government teachers and 11 instructors were sent to the special schools. The Ministry of Education had also agreed to deploy another 25 teachers to the special schools last year. The total government subsidy per pupil in the special schools taking into account the grants provided, the teachers and instructors provided was $1,626 per pupil in 1982. This is 41% more than the subsidy of $1,153 per pupil in our regular primary schools in 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of physical facilities, two school buildings have been made available to the special schools at nominal rental. The Ministry is also assisting the Singapore Association for Retarded Children to take over the Griffiths School building for the Association's use on a nominal rental basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some handicapped children with normal intelligence attend regular schools at both primary and secondary levels. There are nine visually-handicapped pupils and 59 pupils with hearing impairment studying in our regular primary schools. At the secondary level, 36 visually-handicapped students are studying in seven regular secondary schools and 63 students with hearing impairment in two regular secondary schools. Six resource teachers are provided to assist these students. The students attend regular classes with normal students and follow the normal curriculum.

The reason is as follows. Special schools are run by voluntary groups comprising interested and dedicated persons. These schools have special and unique needs, including counselling needs, which the Member described just now. These special needs are quite different, in the curriculum, and in the kind of attention they need, from our regular normal schools. Their management committees are able to look into these needs and provide personal attention in a way which no administrators in a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> bureaucracy can really do. Therefore, instead of taking them over, we believe that it is in the best interest of the special schools to be independent and autonomous.

It is a revenue tax which was imposed first during the Malaysian period and which I found very convenient for financing of other Singapore Government projects. So I do not include payroll tax in the cost of labour. It may be considered as a revenue item. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skills Development Fund has been set up specially to increase the productivity of workers, and the amounts which have been disbursed are increasing and will eventually increase to meet the contributions which are being made by the companies.

There are still some 2,300 street hawkers comprising 1,450 cooked food, 310 market produce and 540 piece and sundry goods hawkers who must be resettled into proper premises for environmental and public health reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy to resite all street hawkers into proper premises was implemented in 1970. All new markets and food centres built by the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) and HDB are reserved for this purpose. The HDB also reserved some stalls in its markets and food centres to resettle shopkeepers and farmers in lieu of alternative premises or cash compensation. Some 23,200 street hawkers have been resited since 1970. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the cooked food centres at Kreta Ayer, Church Street, Amoy Street and Hill Street, another 1,170 street \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> hawkers will be resited, leaving a balance of 1,130 hawkers on the street.

My Ministry and the Ministry of National Development will be looking into various alternatives, including the conversion of vacant market produce stalls in existing MOE and HDB markets into cooked food stalls. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our priority, therefore, is in the resiting of street hawkers into the limited number of existing stalls. We are aware though of the growing tendency amongst the public to patronize stalls with accomplished culinary skills to the extent that people travel long distances to patronize their favourite food centres. Today, the business of selling cooked food is no longer a means to eke out a livelihood, but it is a business as lucrative as any other for those with special culinary skills. We see culinary skills as our heritage. However, in view of the priority we have to give to the resiting of street hawkers, the question of issuing more licences based on culinary skills would have to be considered later.

My Ministry has, however, ensured that adequate bus services were provided and charging the usual bus fares during the festive season. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A proposal to allow taxi drivers to levy a $1 surcharge during the Chinese New Year holidays is being considered by the Taxi Advisory Committee.

Taxi drivers are obliged to stop when flagged unless they have passengers in their taxis or a 'NOT FOR HIRE' sign has been displayed. However, sometimes taxi drivers did not stop because they did not notice that there were commuters by the roadside flagging for their taxis as they need also to pay attention to traffic conditions on the road. Therefore, complaints of this nature need to be carefully investigated by ROV. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MASS RAPID TRANSIT PROJECT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Progress)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Rohan bin Kamis -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis</b> asked the Minister for Communications and Minister for Labour what is the latest position of the Mass Rapid Transit project. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the hon.

The number of deaths increased from 28 in 1981 to 49 in 1982, an increase of 75%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shipbuilding and repairing industry, there were 1,274 accidents in 1982. This is only six cases more than the number in 1981. The number of fatal accidents has however fallen dramatically from 24 in 1981 to nine in 1982, a decrease of 62%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction and shipbuilding and repairing industries are two of the most hazardous industries. Not surprisingly, our citizens shun employment in these two \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> industries. We, therefore, have to import large numbers of foreign workers for our construction sites and shipyards. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety situation in the shipbuilding and repairing industry has improved. Although the safety record in the construction industry appeared to have worsened, it may not be so if we take into account the fact that there was a great increase in volume of construction from 1981 to 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we must continue to improve the safety record if we are to attract our citizens to work in these two industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has a two-pronged approach to improve safety in the construction industry. These are the education of workers and contractors and enforcement action against violation of safety rules. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have established an Advisory Committee for the Construction Industry. The responsibility of the Committee is to identify problem areas in the construction industry, particularly with regard to safety. Once a safety problem is identified, the Ministry of Labour and NPB will map out an education programme to educate workers and supervisors on safety. The programme will include training and distribution of safety pamphlets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NPB has started a mass safety orientation course to educate construction workers on basic safety knowledge. Each course lasts three to four hours. Unfortunately, the response to the course has not been encouraging. We may have to require contractors to send all their workers in batches to attend the course as a condition for the issue of work permits to their foreign workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite education, there will be some contractors who cut corners on safety precautions. My Ministry has stepped up routine and surprise inspections on worksites. Those who commit minor offences are fined. Those who commit more serious offences are charged in court. More intense enforcement action is taken against contractors who have bad safety records. In such cases, factory inspectors \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will issue Stop Work Orders if the construction sites are grossly unsafe. Work can only resume after remedial action is taken. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a further deterrent, my Ministry will not extend or grant work permits to workers of contractors who persistently flout safety rules. We may even revoke work permits of existing workers of such contractors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long run, safety in the construction industry must be improved through strategic changes, such as the use of metal scaffolding, mechanization and better construction methods. These will require more skilled workers. They will also provide for a safer working environment. Skilled workers should also be more safety conscious, and commit less errors which can lead to tragic accidents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shipbuilding and repairing industry, my Ministry has introduced accident prevention systems which must be followed by shipyards to prevent accidents such as fire, explosion, electrocution and other.serious accidents. My Ministry has a continuing programme of inspecting all shipyards. The larger shipyards are inspected as often as once a week. These inspections are to ensure that the shipyards conscientiously adhere to the accident prevention systems. We also render assistance to shipyards to help them improve safety measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, my Ministry only enforced safety measures for ships docked in shipyards. Recently, the accident prevention programme was extended to cover oil tankers in the harbour in which tank cleaning work is carried out. It was recognized that tank cleaning is extremely hazardous if safety precautions, such as proper ventilation, are not taken. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry, in conjunction with the Singapore Association of Shipbuilders and Repairers, also has a safety education scheme for workers in the shipbuilding and repairing industry. Under the scheme, all shipyard workers have to undergo a one-day safety instruction course at NPB. After that, they will be issued with a safety permit. All contractors' workers are required to have safety permits before they are allowed to work in shipyards. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State has said that deaths in the construction industry have risen dramatically last year; I think he said about 75%.

Sports clubs wishing to use football pitches can do so by arranging with school authorities or the Sports Council for the use of their football fields. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Telok Blangah/Radin Mas area, as part of the Mount Faber Park Phase I development, the Parks and Recreation Department will be developing a parcel of land at the junction of Telok Blangah Way and Henderson Road as a playfield suitable for football games and other sporting activities.

Previously, they were projecting a 10% per annum increase in tourist arrivals, but in 1982 the number of arrivals was about three million persons. The increase was only 4.5%. 1 believe the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board is now making new projections and monitoring the situation. Nobody really knows how many new arrivals there will be in the next few years. Of course, right now with the recession, the outlook is not very good. But they will have to look into it and nobody really knows until the time comes. So from these figures, it is possible that there will be some surplus rooms. But this will be good for the tourist industry. In fact, as you will recall, over the last three years, the room rates went up very rapidly because of the tight situation.

In March 1981, rates were increased by 30% across-the-board. In December 1981, rates were again increased by 50% for squatter houses and ancillary farm structures. Inflation during 1982 has been low, amounting to only 3.9%. There is, therefore, no compelling reason for another upward revision of resettlement compensation. The current compensation rates are still adequate. Nevertheless, I wish to assure the hon. Member for Punggol that resettlement rates are regularly reviewed by my Ministry and will be increased when the need arises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the second part of the Member's question, as a general rule, the Resettlement Department releases ex gratia compensation to squatters soon after they accept alternative HDB accommodation. However, delays in the payment of resettlement compensation sometimes occur. The assessment of compensation is both \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> time-consuming and tedious. Improvements belonging to each squatter have to be recorded, measured in prescribed ways, and assessed for payment according to prevailing rates. These assessments require the verification and approval of the HDB's internal auditor before payments can be made. As far as possible, the Resettlement Department will expedite payments to squatters after they accept allocation of HDB flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the announcement by the Hon. Minister for National Development that prices of HDB flats will go up in the next two to three years, does not this become a more compelling reason for the compensation rates, whether they are ex gratia or otherwise, to be revised? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I think hon.

At the moment we do not yet know what the increase will be. These figures represent the upper limits and until that time, I think the compelling reason is not there.

But there are other factors too, for example, disturbance allowance and so on, which depend on the cost of living. In fact, the 50% increase in December 1981 was more than adequate to compensate for the 38% average increase in HDB prices in 1981. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Do I take it then that the Hon.

There are fruit trees, concrete structures, and so on. So I do not think it is quite fair to relate one to the other. This proposal has been made in the past that we should, in fact, index the compensation rates to HDB flat prices.

On 22nd March, 1979, the Government relaxed this rule to give re-housing priority to single persons who contract marriage after the cut-off date but before the last day of the resettlement census survey. However, those who got married after the census survey will not be granted resettlement priority. They will only be allocated 1 -room rental flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all squatters found on the site affected by resettlement automatically qualify for re-housing priority. A squatter affected by resettlement action must satisfy the following criteria to qualify for priority: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) He must prove his residence on the site before the cut-off date by way of the address in his identity card or through some acceptable document issued by Government Departments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) He must be a Singapore citizen not below the age of 21. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) He must have an approved family nucleus living on the site before the cut-off date. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) At least one other member of his family must be a Singapore citizen or permanent resident. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Hon.

These are the people we have to cut out. Only genuine cases are considered. We have, in fact, relaxed the rules already, as explained before.

Members, seeks to amend this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> section to improve the standard of banking secrecy in Singapore. The proposed amendment would also minimize the publicity that could arise when a bank seeks a court decision when there are conflicting claims to deposits with a bank. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Section 42 of the Banking Act prohibits the divulgence of information on customers' accounts to non-residents. It is silent with respect to residents. The proposed amendment will extend the coverage to all persons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proposed amendments, two other concepts are also introduced. The first is the requirement of a bank officer or a person, who has access to the records of accounts of bank's customers, to preserve the secrecy of the information at all times, i.e. even after a person ceases to be associated with the bank. The second is the provision for civil court proceedings to be held in camera. Information given during such proceedings will be secret between the court and the parties involved. The publication of the identities of parties involved in such court proceedings will also be prohibited. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing exceptions to the secrecy provision will be incorporated in the proposed amendment. These cover areas where the customer gives permission or is declared a bankrupt or where the information is required for commercial purposes or under the Evidence Act. Two additional exceptions are proposed in the amendment:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) In civil cases, where a bank seeks the Court to interplead between conflicting claims, to money in a customer's account; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In situations under any written law in Singapore where the information is required to be given to a public officer in the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offence. The laws defined for this purpose are Part IV of the Evidence Act, the Criminal Procedure Code, the Internal Security Act, the Income Tax Act, the Prevention of Corruption Act, the Kidnapping Act and the Companies Act. This exception is to allow interests of the State to take precedence over banking secrecy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Act do not prevent the MAS from performing its banking supervision function of inspecting the books of the banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Tanah Merah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek clarification from the First Deputy Prime Minister. This is related to a certain provision in the Companies Act. I believe that section 69N of the Companies Act empowers a company to write to a member of the company to disclose the beneficial ownership of the shares. Now, with the present provision, can a bank which acts on behalf of someone, hide under this secrecy act and refuse to disclose the beneficiary owner? If it is so, it appears to be a loophole to circumvent the Takeover Codes of the SES. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Can the hon. Member repeat the last part of his question? To circumvent what? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Under the Takeover Codes, if one holds more than 20% of the shares of a company, one is obliged under the law to make a general offer to all the shares not in one's holding. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am not sure whether I agree with the hon. Member that that will be the consequence of this amendment. In the case of disclosure of ownership of shares in the company to be taken over, the subject comes under the Securities Industry Council. Whether the bank has such information or not is another matter. The provisions of banking secrecy refer to amounts of moneys placed in bank accounts. I am unable to give a clear direction on the issue he raised, but if he wishes to have further clarification I will be glad to look into the matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Goh Keng Swee]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>3.43 p.m. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1982\" to \"1983\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>DEVELOPMENT LOAN BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>3.44 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development Loan Act, 1978, which came into operation in February 1978 authorised a sum of $6,000 million to be raised by way of loans for the purposes of the Development Fund.

It also provides for all statutory contributions to the Central Provident Fund and designated pension or provident fund to be exempt from estate duty. If such contributions exceed $100,000, no further relief from estate duty is given for other assets except dwelling houses.

Jayakumar): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5(1) of the Land Acquisition Act (Cap. 272) provides that whenever any particular land is needed - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) for any public purpose; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) by any person, corporation or statutory board, for any work or an undertaking which, in the opinion of the Minister, is of public benefit or of public utility or in the public interest; or \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) for any residential, commercial or industrial purposes, the President may, by notification published in the Gazette, declare the land to be required for the purpose specified in the notification. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 21(l) of the Port of Singapore Authority Act (Cap. 173) provides that where any immovable property, not being State land, is needed for the purposes of the Authority and cannot be acquired by \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> agreement, the Authority may request, and the President may, if he thinks fit, direct the acquisition of such property in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In two recent cases before the High Court, it was argued on behalf of the landowners that the words \"and cannot be acquired by agreement\" impose a condition precedent to acquisition, i.e. prior negotiations with the landowners must be complied with before the Authority can request the President to acquire the lands. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Court rejected this argument and held that the words were too oblique and wholly inadequate if they were intended to impose such a condition on the Authority. The Court held that the provision merely requires the Authority to satisfy the President that the lands were needed for the purposes of the Authority and could not be acquired by agreement. Whether the lands in question can or cannot be acquired by agreement is exclusively a matter between the Authority and the President in the course of public administration. The effect of the High Court decision is, therefore, to affirm that section 21(l) does not impose an obligation on the Authority to enter into prior negotiations with the landowners. It follows that landowners do not have a corresponding right to compel the Authority to enter into prior negotiations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point raised in the litigation is undoubtedly a technical one. Although the High Court has construed section 21 (1) in a manner which is in accord with its real intention, it is desirable that there should not be any further doubt on this matter as the Acts incorporating several other statutory bodies (set out in the Schedule to this Bill) contain a similar provision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend all those Acts by removing those words in the various statutory provisions which may give rise to the element of uncertainty. The Bill also ensures that no previous compulsory acquisitions of lands will be questioned on the ground that there were no prior negotiations or attempts at entering into agreement with landowners. This is necessary in the public interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is in conformity with the legal position as declared by the High Court. I should like to stress that the Bill does not in any way affect the existing rights which are accorded to landowners under the Land Acquisition Act. It makes clear beyond any doubt what is, and has always been, the legal position. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill before the House seeks to do two things. If I may first take the second thing that it seeks to do which is provided by clause 3. It seeks to shut out any person whose land has been acquired before the commencement of this Bill by any of the statutory boards mentioned in the Schedule from challenging the acquisition before the courts on the ground that the statutory board in question had not complied with a provision in the Act. This, as the Minister has stated, was done in the two cases that were brought up in the High Court. In the result, the court decided that what the Port of Singapore Authority did in the particular instance was in accordance with the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not the end of the matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, because there is provided in the judicial machinery a right of appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal and from the Court of Appeal to the Privy Council if the party which is dissatisfied with the judgment wishes to take it up with the Privy Council. I understand that, in the particular cases that were referred to by the Hon. Minister, one of the parties lodged a notice of appeal against the decision of the High Court and the appeal was pending before the Court of Appeal. Before the appeal could be heard, this Bill was introduced in Parliament on 3rd December last year. And I understand that the party has decided to withdraw the appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this Bill seeks to do is to grant immunity from legal process to any of the statutory boards specified in the Schedule from any person who might wish to test the acquisition of his property by the statutory board in question by \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> recourse to the courts. His complaint that the statutory board had not complied with the requisite provision in the law before acquiring the property can no longer be entertained by the court. So the citizen is left without any right where, before the passing of the Bill, there was a right in him to question the acquisition of his property by any one of the specified statutory boards. This right, which is a right which he thought was given to him under the law, is taken away now by this Bill which seeks to shut out any recourse to the courts by any property owner whose property has been acquired by any of the statutory boards specified in the Act. It is for that reason that I consider that this Bill is thoroughly objectionable. It interferes with a right that the citizen possessed before the commencement of this Bill. I am, of course, aware that the High Court has declared in the particular instances that there was no such right in the property owner to require the statutory board to enter into negotiation with him. But as I have said, Sir, the matter did not end there. It is always open to somebody else now to challenge the acquisition of his property in the High Court relying on this very same ground and to take it right up, as I have said, from the High Court to the Court of Appeal or, still further than that, to the Privy Council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, why is this right of the citizen being taken away from him? Is there any particular reason why it should be taken away? A citizen has a right to expect that if he once sets the judicial machinery in motion, he would be allowed to exhaust the whole of the judicial machinery and that his right to do so is not taken away from him at any stage during the proceedings. And yet this is what this Bill has done in the cases before the High Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is retroactive in that sense. It seeks to alter a situation that had existed in the past prior to the introduction of this Bill, and I do not have to remind the Hon. Minister of State and the other legal Members of this House that retroactive legislation has been considered to be most undesirable and should not be resorted to unless it is absolutely necessary. But this is what this Bill seeks to do. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard in this House, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this Government would not allow the law, the rules, to be bent for anyone. The Prime Minister, at the last sitting on the 3rd December, 1982, in reply to my question to him on whether he would direct the Ministries to give detailed answers when they reject any application from a citizen, said the rules were clear enough. He said, \"What the Member does not understand is that the rules cannot be bent for anyone.\" And today we heard from the Minister of State for National Development again that I was here to ask that rules be bent. I am not here to ask that the law be bent or that rules be bent for anyone. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do think I am entitled to protest at what is happening or what is sought to be done by this Bill. Here we have a situation where two parties, two litigants, albeit wealthy companies, were complaining to the courts, as they have a right to do, that the statutory board in question, the Port of Singapore Authority, had bent the law, that the Port of Singapore Authority had not followed the law when it acquired their properties. So they were complaining that the Port of Singapore Authority had bent the law, and they went to the court. They did not, of course, succeed in the court of first instance. But they had a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal and, further still, to the Privy Council if they thought it necessary. But that was not all. As I have said, somebody else could bring an action, somebody who perhaps did not think that the decision of the High Court was right in this matter. He could bring an action complaining that the Port of Singapore Authority had bent the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what this Bill seeks to do is to tell them, \"You cannot complain any more that the Port of Singapore Authority or any of the other statutory boards had bent the law.\" So what is the citizen to do in such a case when he sees this state of affairs? He is told that the Government, the Ministries, will not bend the law. He accepts that. I do not think anybody wants the law to be bent. But what has he got to say when he finds that when he makes a complaint to the court that a Government agency, a statutory board, has bent the law (because that is what it amounts to - not strictly \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> following the provisions of the Act, the law), he is shut out. He is told, \"You cannot complain. You have got to accept it. You cannot have any recourse to the courts.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is in my respectful submission a most reprehensible state of affairs. There cannot be one law for the Government, one law for the Government agencies, statutory boards, and another law for the citizens. We are all subject to the same law. If the citizen cannot bend the law and it cannot be bent for him, then it should not be bent or cannot be bent for a statutory board or any Government organization. I do not know what is the need for the haste with which this Bill was introduced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it does not reflect very much confidence in this House, or the Ministry perhaps, in the judgment of the High Court that we should be asked to sit, as it were, like a Court of Appeal upon the judgment of the High Court and confirm it for all time. Why has it been necessary to introduce this Bill now rather than allow the litigants who were before the High Court to exhaust the whole judicial machinery? It interferes with a vested right that they had acquired when they commenced the action. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that ground alone I would say that this Bill is thoroughly objectionable. I would ask the Minister to consider this matter again, at least whether the Bill should be referred to a Select Committee not only on this question but also on the other matter on which I propose to speak, i.e. the second objective of this Bill which, in point of order, is the first one in the Bill [clause 2] to amend the provisions in the Acts specified in the Schedule so as to obviate the necessity for the statutory boards mentioned in the Schedule to first enter into negotiations with property owners before they acquire the land. As the Minister has pointed out, the provisions in the various Acts state that where land is needed for the purposes of the statutory boards, they should try and acquire that land by agreement, and only when the property cannot be acquired by agreement that they should have recourse to the machinery in the Land Acquisition Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if there is one Act which has caused a lot of unhappiness in Singapore and which has impoverished the people in Singapore, it is the Land Acquisition Act. May I say, Sir, that it is not on behalf of the wealthy land owners that I am talking, people who own acres and acres of land in Singapore. They are few. This Act has impoverished many a person who is nowhere near being wealthy. I have in my constituency, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Kampong Bahru area, people who probably really belong to the lower middle class, who own their little houses - they are situated in Miri Road, Borneo Road - and there are also the shopkeepers. They are not wealthy by any means. They are, as I have said, probably of the lower middle class group. If this Bill is passed and if their properties are affected by this acquisition as they are, they cannot complain that the Port of Singapore Authority had not in the first place approached them and tried to acquire their land by private arrangement. I am aware that there was a recent announcement by the Government of a change in policy that where the acquisition is of a house occupied for dwelling purposes, then the compensation that should be awarded should relate to an amount equal to providing the person with an alternative house. But that was a matter of policy I understood, and I do not think it has yet been implemented. That only applies to dwelling houses. There are the shopkeepers, the small shopkeeper who owns his own shop. You are going to bring the full rigours of the Land Acquisition Act to bear on him. Before the introduction of this Bill (and it only came to light because of these cases that went up to the High Court), the statutory boards would have been obliged to negotiate with him in the first place to see whether they can reach an agreement for the purchase of the property. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the Land Acquisition Act was first introduced, it provided for adequate compensation to be paid to persons whose properties were acquired under the Act. When we became a part of Malaysia in 1963, this was safeguarded in the Constitution of Malaysia - that no law shall provide for the compulsory acquisi- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tion of property without adequate compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964, even while we were still a part of Malaysia, an attempt was made to amend the Land Acquisition Act, or Ordinance as it was then known, to provide for less than adequate compensation to property owners whose properties were acquired. That Bill was referred to a Select Committee and that Select Committee sent a report back to the House saying that, until the Constitution was amended, the main provisions of the Bill could not take effect because it might be considered to be ultra vires the Constitution. So that Bill, I think, died a natural death. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then when we came out of Malaysia, the Constitution was amended by taking out the requirement that adequate compensation be paid to property owners if their lands or properties were acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. So the way was made clear for the introduction of a new Act, the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act in 1966 which went on to provide for compensation for the owners whose properties were acquired. And, as I said, these were less than adequate compensation. In a report to the Select Committee, the estate valuers body said that this Bill (that was then being considered), which was to provide for less than adequate compensation, departed from the accepted principle that when a government acquired property it should pay adequate reasonable compensation, and they thought that it was most undesirable. So this became an accomplished fact in 1966, departing from the accepted principle in most civilized countries that if you must acquire property from your citizens, then you pay your citizen adequate compensation, you do not impoverish him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Act continued until 1973 when more drastic provisions were introduced, and as the Judge observed in his judgment the gulf between reasonable adequate compensation, the market price, i.e. the price prevailing at the time of the acquisition, and the compensation paid under the Land Acquisition Act pursuant to the amendments in 1973, was unbridgeable. So as the Judge himself observed there was a wide gulf between adequate \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> reasonable compensation that should have been paid to the owner of the property and the compensation that the Act proposed to pay. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One might say that the poor man has to accept this in the national interest if the land is required for a public purpose, for example, for defence purposes, or for the building of a hospital or a school which is intended to serve and benefit the community at large. But why should he be asked to accept this sacrifice where the acquisition is by a commercial undertaking? The Port of Singapore Authority is a commercial undertaking. If one looks at the Schedule to the Port of Singapore Authority Act which sets out the functions and duties of the Port of Singapore Authority, one will find that the Authority is empowered to carry on various businesses like shipbuilding, shiprepairing, warehousing. So it is a commercial organization. And as the Judge observed, these properties were acquired for the purpose of a multi-storey warehouse and terminal for the businesses of the PSA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my question is: why should it be thought not necessary for these people who occupy these houses to be paid adequate reasonable compensation? It is all wrong. I would ask the House to consider seriously whether it is right that the principle of the Land Acquisition Act be applied in acquisitions by statutory boards which are, really, carrying on commercial undertakings. I expect the Port of Singapore Authority, when it builds its warehouses, will let them out at competitive rates. It is not going to let them out at a pittance - at cheap rates. I should think not. So why should the poor owner be made to sacrifice his hard-earned wealth and give up his property? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are eight statutory boards mentioned in the Schedule and except perhaps for the Monuments Board and the National University of Singapore, the others are really commercial undertakings, although one would, I suppose, include the Housing and Development Board as a board for a public purpose, even though the Board carries on its activities as a commercial organization. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my respectful submission to this House and to the Mem- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> bers a principle worthy of adoption by us that, first of all, the Government and statutory boards, Government agencies, should be on the same footing as private citizens when it comes to acquisition of properties and the prices that are paid. You have this anomaly. The Government acquires properties at prices which are far, far below the market price. As the Judge said in the High Court, it is unbridgeable. It is an exercise in futility if you try to match them. Yet when it comes to selling these properties, what does the Government do? It sells them at the inflated market price. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall to mind, Mr Speaker, Sir, the remarks made by a taxi driver to me. This was sometime before I became a Member of Parliament, and before the NTUC started its correction classes for taxi drivers to stop them talking too much. We were passing a site which had been acquired by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. He was a Chinese man. He was talking to me in Malay, and he said, \"Look at this. Who can't get rich like this? You buy at 10 cents and then you sell for $100. 1 can also get rich like this.\" He was not the owner of the property, but he could see the whole injustice of it. To him, it was daylight plunder. And that is the view of many of our people about the Land Acquisition Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we are not debating the Land Acquisition Act. We are debating the Port of Singapore Authority Act and the other Acts. But I brought this in because what this Bill seeks to do is to equate the acquisition by these statutory boards with the acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act. I would, in all seriousness and in earnestness, ask the Minister whether he would give further consideration to this Bill. I would address this to the Minister personally - would he ask his colleagues in the Cabinet to consider this Bill further and, even if it is not necessary to refer this Bill to a Select Committee, whether there is any reason why statutory boards which are run like commercial organizations or undertakings should not pay, forget about the market price but, at least, some reasonable adequate compensation to the owners when the boards are going to use their property for a commercial under-taking. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has spoken at length. My response need not be lengthy because this Bill has a very specific purpose. It seeks to amend several laws, to delete certain provisions, certain words, which had given rise to litigation. In the course of the litigation, the High Court came to a clear judgment as to the meaning of those words, and this Bill seeks to remove any further uncertainty or doubt which may arise as a result of such legislation not being changed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that one can seriously criticize this Bill if one did not have a very good grasp of the judgment of the Judge in the High Court on this particular case. I thought that the Member for Anson, when he took the floor, had such knowledge. After his long speech I am convinced that he has no idea of the key essentials of the judgment of the High Court. If one reads the judgment, it will be very clear as to how absurd it would be to interpret the words to arrive at any other meaning than what the Court had reached. Secondly, although the Member for Anson tried to pre-empt a reply from me on his remarks about the Land Acquisition Act by saying that we are not debating the Land Acquisition Act after his rambling pot shots at the Act, let me say that I also assume that a Member who wants to take the Government to task for the land acquisition policy in this House must be presumed to be very familiar with the various important considerations and grounds which have influenced the evolution of the Government's land acquisition policy, starting with important pronouncements made in this House, either by the Prime Minister or the Minister for Law and National Development (and now Minister for Law) in 1961, 1963, 1964, 1966, (as well as the debate on the Constitutional Commission in 1967) and in 1973. Those pronouncements clearly explained why it was necessary for Singapore in its particular circumstances, considering that land was a scarce commodity and that the situation of land is unique in Singapore as compared to other countries, to have adopted the policy that we did and why the land acquisition policy evolved the way it did. And the Member for Anson has shown in his speech that he \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is not conversant with these fundamental considerations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land is a special situation in Singapore. He has made the preposterous statement that if there is any Act in Singapore which has impoverished large numbers of people, it is the Land Acquisition Act. My response is that it is not only untrue but that is a clear falsehood. In fact, I challenge the Member for Anson to point out to me any other country in the world which has such a scarcity of land, which has such a high density of population but which nevertheless has been able to achieve the degree of success in housing, industrialization, port facilities and other important social, economic and industrial development, notwithstanding the scarcity of the land. Indeed I would go so far as to say that if this Government had not the foresight and wisdom to evolve the land acquisition policy it did over the years, we would not have the Singapore that we know today, where more than 70% of the population are housed in public housing, where we have roads, and other facilities. He referred to the Port of Singapore Authority and wondered, with some feigned incredulity, how port and warehouse facilities could be equated with public purpose. I would have thought that any secondary school child would know why for Singapore, as one of the busiest ports in the world, port facilities are an integral part of the economy; how can it be said that our port facilities are unrelated to any public purpose? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think his remarks do not warrant any detailed examination for I think any disinterested observer, whether in Singapore or abroad, coming to Singapore, seeing the situation, marvels at the way in which we have been able to achieve the progress in national interest in all sectors of development. Could this have been possible by a land acquisition policy which followed the archaic concepts in other countries where land is plentiful and where private property interests prevailed over over-riding national interest? The answer is obviously no. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the specific points he raised about this individual piece of legislation. He has made equally unsu- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> portable propositions. First of all, he said that this has denied these landowners, most of whom are wealthy, immunity from legal process, and he has said that no landowner will be able - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It gives the statutory boards immunity. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> It will give the statutory boards immunity? That, too, is a complete distortion of this Bill. He interprets the two clauses as conferring statutory boards immunity from legal process in any case of land acquisition. If one reads the Bill carefully, one can see that clause 3 says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No compulsory acquisition of any immovable property ... shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the acquisition was not in compliance with any of the specified provisions ...'. and the specified provisions are set out in the Schedule. Therefore, where is the immunity that he refers to? Persons are still free to bring whatever legal action they are entitled to under the law in respect of all other aspects of land acquisition. So it is not true. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point he has raised is that this takes away vested rights. The simple question before us and before this House is this. Do we want uncertainty with regard to land acquisition? Do we want public development schemes to be impeded, held up and delayed while various legal actions - pending, not pending, still in the minds of litigants - take their natural course? Anyone who has read the judgment of the High Court will come to the answer, \"Obviously not.\" The judg ment of the High Court has pointed out that if the contrary interpretation prevails, the result will be that there will be two groups of statutory boards: one group of statutory boards which will be under an obligation to enter into negotiations, and another group of statutory boards which are not under an obligation. The High Court has also pointed out that another effect of a contrary interpretation would be that there would be two legal regimes of land acquisition: one legal regime where statutory boards will have to pay compensation at present day values, and another regime of land acquisition where statutory boards will have to pay at the 1973 values. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> question therefore is, could this Legislature and its predecessors have envisioned such an absurd result? The answer is no, and precisely to confirm that intention this Bill has been tabled. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I be allowed to answer? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You are allowed only to speak once to any Question, Mr Jeyaretnam, under our Standing Orders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof Jayakumar]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> The citation year will be altered from \"1982\" to \"1983\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 3 - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That clauses 2 and 3 stand part of the Bill.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I claim for a division, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> Would you accept a voice vote, Mr Jeyaretnam? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> If it will save time, yes.

Certain areas, largely in Lincuogang, have been accordingly set aside for this purpose. They have been proclaimed by the President in exercise of his powers under section 8 of the Military Manoeuvres Act as manoeuvring or firing grounds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military exercises by the Army are conducted in the manoeuvring grounds. In firing grounds, artillery and rifle practices, air firing and bomb dropping are carried out from weapons on the ground or from aircraft in flight. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent members of the public from entering into these grounds at grave risk to themselves, my Ministry has demarcated and gazetted the boundaries of these grounds. Warning signboards in the four languages are also posted along these boundaries. Public announcements are made to remind members of the public of the dangers of entering into these areas. Sentries are also posted at various strategic points along the boundaries. Boats also patrol the coastal boundaries before live firing commences. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the public, however, surreptitiously evade the sentries and deliberately trespass into these areas. Most of them are scrap metal and fruit dealers. They are prepared to risk their lives to pick a few fruits and to collect the scrap metal even when military and live firing exercises are in progress. Others enter into these areas to fish. In November 1978, a junkyard operator, his wife and an employee, died in their junkyard when they tried to dismantle a blind ammunition. The State Coroner inquiring into their deaths, besides being satisfied that the SAF had taken all reasonable steps to warn the public and trespassers of the dangers \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of entering live firing areas, found that the junkyard operators must have obtained the blind from the nearby live firing area. On 3rd August, 1980, another junkyard operator died under similar circumstances. Recently, on 23rd June, 1982, a civilian trespassed into the live firing area to pick durians and was injured, fortunately not fatally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is very concerned about the unnecessary loss of lives and the injuries to trespassers into these areas. Police action against these trespassers have not been effective, largely because of the inadequate penalties that can be imposed on them. For unlawfully interfering with the execution of manoeuvres, under section 6 of the Military Manoeuvres Act, the fine is only $20. Where such trespassers without due authority remove any distinguishing flag or other mark or maliciously cut or damage any telecommunication facilities used for the manoeuvres, the fine is only $50. Furthermore, for unauthorized entry and remaining within firing grounds when it is closed, an offence under Rule 7 of the Pasir Laba Firing Ground Rules, 1966, read with section 11 of the Military Manoeuvres Act, the fine is only a maximum of $100. These fines are obviously ineffective. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence this Bill. The main features of this Bill are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The penalties are enhanced to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and imprisonment. This will make it unprofitable for trespassers to risk conviction and hence reduce the temptation to trespass. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) The offences under the Act are made seizable offences by empowering the police or any commissioned officer engaged in the manoeuvres, or warrant officer, non-commissioned officer or military policeman of the Singapore Armed Forces to arrest the trespasser without warrant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) All persons not engaged in military or air force activities during exercises are excluded at all times from the whole or any part of any firing ground. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consequence of the amendment to section 11 of the Military Manoeuvres Act, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Pasir Laba Firing Ground Rules, 1966, will be revoked, and new Rules made thereunder.

Members</b> are aware from the Report which was presented to this House as Paper Misc. 8 of 1982 that a Commission consisting of you, Mr Speaker, the Minister for Finance, the Minister of Defence and Second Minister for Health, the Minister for Trade and Industry, and a member of the Public Service Commission was appointed to study the revision of salary scales of posts in the Parliament service consequent on the revision of salary scales of posts in other services in the Civil Service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has met and made its recommendations. The Report is brief and speaks for itself. I have no comments to make thereon but have no hesitation in saying, Mr Speaker, that your staff have always set a high standard of performance and lent a willing and able helping hand to Members of this House, some of whom, sometimes, grope, as if in the dark, with our Standing Orders. Members, I am sure, will agree with me that an increase in the salaries of the staff of this House is long overdue and the Commission has recommended that the increases be as set out in paragraph 10 of the Report and take effect from the 1st June, 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move that this House resolves accordingly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, noting the Report of the Commission on Parliament Staff as contained in Paper Misc. 8 of 1982, accepts the recommendations of the Commission as contained in paragraph 10 thereof and resolves in accordance with such recommendations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CIVIL LIST</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the Motion* standing in my name under item No. 9 in the Order Paper. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> *The Motion reads as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil List and Pension Act (Chapter 52), resolves that the Schedule to the said Act be varied by deleting the figures \"$385,000\", \"$15,000\", \"$1,495,500\", \"$346,600\" and \"$87,900\" in the second column and substituting the figures \"$409,000\", \"$16,000\", \"$1,960,700\", \"$380,900\" and \"$40,000\" respepctively. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to increase the provisions for the Privy Purse and Salaries of personal staff by $24,000 and $465,200 respectively, because of the recent salary revision, annual increments, the 1983 NWC wage supplement as well as higher contributions to the Central Provident Fund and Skills Development Fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increase of $34,300 for Expenses of the Istana household is required mainly to meet rising costs of stores and maintenance. Higher costs also make it necessary to increase the entertainment vote by $1,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $40,000 has been provided under Special Services mainly for the replacement of three refrigerators, three lawn mowers, a knapsack grass cutter and a power sprayer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary to vary the provisions in the Schedule to the Civil List as follows:- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for \"The Privy Purse\" from $385,000 to $409,000; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for \"Entertainment\" from $15,000 to $16,000; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for \"Salaries of personal staff\" from $1,495,500 to $1,960,700; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for \"Expenses of household\" from $346,600 to $380,900; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for \"Special services\" from $87,900 to $40,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil List and Pension Act (Chapter 52), resolves that the Schedule to the said Act be varied by deleting the figures \"$385,000\", \"$15,000\", \"$1,495,500\", \"$346,600\" and \"$87,900\" in the second column and substituting the figures \"$409,000\", \"$16,000\", \"$1,960,700\", \"$380,900\" and \"$40,000\" respectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.59 p.m. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1983 to 31st March, 1984.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been delegated the authority by the Minister for Finance to prepare and deliver the Budget Statement under Articles 144 and 145 of the Constitution of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of my Statement comprises a review of the progress of the Singapore economy in 1982 and our economic policy. The second will elaborate on the Main and Development Estimates for the financial year 1983 and the third on the Revenue Estimates and tax changes to meet our social and economic objectives. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Section I</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>The Economy in 1982</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A detailed review of the performance of our economy in 1982 can be found in the Economic Survey of Singapore, 1982 (Cols. 447 - 728), copies of which have been given to hon. Members of the House earlier. Today I shall highlight our performance briefly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my Budget Statement last year, I told the House that I expected 1982 to be a grim year with mounting problems of unemployment and protectionism in the industrialized countries. To my regret, my fears have turned out to be well-founded. The world economy is today in a most perilous state. The hopes of many finance ministers, bankers and economists were dashed when the US economy did not recover and consequently failed to pull the world out of the recession. Instead, the US economy contracted by 1.8%. Growth in the other industrialized countries, where it did occur, was muted. As a result, more workers in the industrialized countries lost their jobs, causing the already high unemployment to scale to new peaks. In the United States, the number of people who \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> were jobless totalled 12 million (10.8% of the workforce) while in the European Economic Community it was 12.3 million or 11.1% of the workforce. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the adverse economic conditions, world trade shrank by 1.5%, the first decline since 1975. Protectionism became more widespread. In November last year Trade Ministers from 88 countries attended a meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in an attempt to halt and to roll back protectionism. The meeting, however, ended in disarray, spelling more trouble ahead for free trade. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fragile state of the international banking system added to these problems. Following the first oil crisis in 1973, many developing countries borrowed massively to finance their balance-of-payment deficits. Their international debts now exceed US$600 billion. Because of the world recession and the fall in commodity prices they are unable to meet their loan repayments. Major banks had not only to reschedule the existing loan repayments but also provide additional loans to prevent a collapse of the financial system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982 the Singapore economy began to feel the force of these international economic storms. After four years of rapid growth in the region of 9-10% per annum, our economy slowed down considerably last year to grow by 6.3%. However, compared with the dismal economic conditions in most parts of the world, it was nevertheless a respectable performance. We were able to obtain this relatively high rate of growth mainly because of domestic factors. Our construction industry was kept busy with the building of HDB flats. The pace of construction of hotels, factories, commercial complexes and high-rise apartments also continued unabated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than construction, however, all major sectors of the economy were affected by the recession. Manufacturing was particularly hard-hit. Its output fell by 6%, the first decline since the last recession in 1975. Our external trade which used to enjoy high annual growth rates, increased by only 2% mainly because of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> larger imports for infrastructural development and for the setting up of new factories. In line with the fall in world trade, the exports of our domestic producers suffered a decline. Although both the transport and communication, and the financial and business services sectors continued to expand, it was at a slower pace than the year before. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the general economic slowdown, we were fortunate that we still had full employment. In fact, more new jobs were created in 1982 than in 1981, especially in the expanding construction sector and in the hotel industry. However, our productivity performance was poor. Productivity grew by only 2.0%, considerably lower than the 5.3% achieved in 1981. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only real cheer for our economy in 1982 was the sharp decline in our inflation rate. The Consumer Price Index rose by 3.9%, less than half the rate of 8.2% in 1981. This increase was among the lowest in the world. As world commodity prices will probably remain depressed while oil prices are likely to decline, the outlook for inflation in 1983 offers some encouragement. We must, however, ensure that domestic factors do not push up our inflation rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans enjoyed a smaller increase in real income in 1982. As measured by GDP per capita, real income rose by 5.1% compared to 8.6% in 1981. This is a further indication of the difficult times that we are going through. Although income has not failed to go up year after year, such increases can no longer be taken for granted. We must, in fact, be prepared for no growth in real income at all if the world economy slides into deeper misery in 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Industrial Development</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now elaborate on specific areas of our economic policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our manufacturing industry is most exposed to the international business environment, it was severely affected by the prolonged worldwide economic recession in 1982. Production in all major industries either declined or grew at sharply \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> reduced rates. Only those producing building materials for the booming construction sector were able to enjoy a faster rate of growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the difficult economic climate, we were able to maintain international confidence in our economic policies and management. New foreign investments in manufacturing continued to flow in at a high rate. We attracted a total of $1.7 billion of new investment commitments in 1982, only slightly lower than the record $1.9 billion achieved in 1981. The quality of new investments remained good. Outside the capital intensive petroleum sector, the major portion of investments were committed for the manufacture of computers and related equipment, electronic components and machinery. Our building programmes induced new investment in the manufacture of construction materials. In the technical services sector, investment commitments for computer software and engineering services increased from $34 million in 1981 to $132 million in 1982. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local companies continued to invest at a satisfactory rate. Their investments of $540 million accounted for more than 30% of total investment commitments in 1982. The Small Industries Finance Scheme (SIFS) played an important role in stimulating the growth and development of local companies. In 1982, $83 million in concessionary loans were granted to 234 cases under the SIFS. A new scheme, the Small Industries Technical Assistance Scheme, has been introduced to assist local companies to obtain the services of suitable experts from multinational companies or consultancy agencies. These experts can help to identify and solve technical and managerial problems of small local companies. The Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (SISIR) has also implemented a government-funded programme to develop a Materials Technology Applications Centre to assist Singapore companies in the area of materials applications. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our industrial development in the years ahead will depend on the pace of automation and research and development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are achieving good progress in these two areas. Several manufacturing and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> technical services companies have installed highly sophisticated computer aided design and computer-aided manufacturing systems, or CAD/CAM for short. More use is being made of robots in manufacturing operations. Over 60 companies have invested in automatic manipulators or programmable robot systems for spray painting, welding, material handling and assembly work. We will continue to encourage automation through the provision of tax incentives and financial assistance. In 1982, 18 companies were given incentives in the form of investment allowances for the purchase of automated equipment. The Skills Development Fund (SDF) also approved over $10 million worth of interest grants in respect of 245 applications under its Interest Grant for Mechanisation Scheme. These grants will generate investment of about $78 million in new automated equipment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support industrial automation, the EDB is expanding its training programmes in the skills required for the operation and maintenance of automated equipment. A CAD/CAM training unit has been established in conjunction with a leading US company in this field while an industrial robotics training unit will soon be established in cooperation with a European robot manufacturer. The EDB's industrial training centres are also being upgraded to include training in the programming of CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines which are increasingly being used in manufacturing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our efforts to encourage R &amp; D have met with encouraging success. According to a survey conducted by the Science Council, 174 establishments in the private and public sectors are currently undertaking some form of R &amp; D. Grants totalling $14 million from the R &amp; D block vote introduced in 1981 have been approved to fund 17 research projects. The 17 projects, undertaken mainly by the National University of Singapore in conjunction with various public-sector agencies and private-sector companies, include work in robotics, micro-processor technology, civil engineering and medical research. Local companies are also being encouraged to venture into new product design and development. In 1982, seven of them have been \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> given grants totalling $680,000 under the Product Development Assistance Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Science Park, which has been designed to serve as a focal point for R &amp; D activities in Singapore and to foster closer interaction between the University and industry, will be ready for occupation this year. The first tenants of the Park will include a Marine Technology Centre and a Software Technology Centre. The National Computer Board and SISIR will also be moving to new premises within the Park. Other candidates under consideration for the Science Park include R &amp; D-oriented companies in biotechnology, robotics and polymer applications. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Prospects Ahead</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate prospects for new investments in manufacturing will continue to be plagued by the recession in our major investor countries. We will have to work even harder this year to attract investments to Singapore. As in the past two years, the EDB will identify and promote selected companies in industries which are least affected by the recession and in areas of new technology which are enjoying growing markets. Existing manufacturing firms will be encouraged to make use of the lull in business to consolidate their operations, diversify into growth areas and upgrade the skills of their workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking further ahead, we will have to prepare ourselves for the very different economic environment that will arise from the structural changes going on in the developed countries. In particular, the push into automation and the rapid rate of technological innovation will have significant implications for our future industrial development. Companies that are presently engaged in automating their existing plants in the US, Europe and Japan will have insufficient resources to undertake new investments overseas. Moreover, with increased productivity from automation there will be less economic advantage in establishing new offshore facilities simply to take advantage of lower wage costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the effects of automation in the industrialized countries, our hope is that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> there will still be the more dynamic multinational companies who will continue to take a global viewpoint in their operations. The EDB will concentrate on identifying such companies with a view to getting them to establish part of their operations in Singapore. To successfully attract highly-automated projects, our non-labour costs namely, the cost of land, factory buildings, utilities and supporting services - must be kept competitive. We will therefore work towards moderating the increases in these costs. Generous tax incentives and concessionary loans will continue to be granted to desirable projects. We will ensure that the new technical skills and services required for automated operations will be readily available. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain our growth and competitiveness in the 1980s, locally-owned and managed companies must also adapt to the changing realities. They must not only automate and upgrade their operations, but also diversify into new, high-technology industries that are replacing the traditional industries as growth leaders. It is encouraging that several of our local companies have already taken steps in this direction. They have linked up with foreign companies to manufacture sophisticated industrial products such as computer peripherals, industrial robots and photovoltaic solar cells. We will encourage more local companies to diversify in this manner. The Economic Development Board (EDB), through its international network, will assist them in making contacts with the right foreign companies. Appropriate incentives will be given for such joint venture projects involving the manufacture and development of new products. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EDB will also intensify its promotion of export-oriented brain services especially those that can make full use of the investments we have made in our technical education facilities. The Board sees potential for Singapore in areas such as computer software, engineering design and technical services, medical testing and laboratory services. The Economic Expansion Incentives Act was originally designed in the 1960s to promote manufacturing industries. The Act will be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> suitably amended to encourage the development of knowledge-based services and activities involving biotechnology, microbiological production and other new technologies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Trade Development Board</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the trade front, the spectre of protectionism continues to loom large. The prolonged world recession has caused many countries to turn desperately to short-term and politically popular measures to safeguard employment. Not only have existing trade restrictions been enforced more strictly but new ones have been introduced. Singapore was again not spared. Our exports of textiles, black and white television receivers, and umbrellas continued to be subject to restrictive measures which have various names like \"orderly marketing arrangements\" or \"voluntary export restraints.\" Other measures include, for example, the ludicrous new ruling by France making it mandatory that the French language be used in the documentation for commercial transactions. The United States, the European Community, Japan and Carlada have tightened up the rules of their Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) to selectively restrict the more competitive countries, including Singapore. Our exports of refrigerator compressors for instance have been removed from the US GSP Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the worldwide trade problems, our domestic exports fell by 1% in 1982, the first decline since 1975. We can expect to face even greater difficulties in the years ahead. The protectionist mood in international trade will prevail for as long as the developed countries are unable to solve their problem of structural unemployment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said last year, and it bears repeating, our best defence against trade protectionism is to increase our productivity so that our goods will still be competitive in price and quality despite protectionistic barriers. We will need to expand our domestic exports by pursuing more aggressive strategies in existing markets and by penetrating new markets. In the longer term, we can become less vulnerable to protectionism only by restructuring \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> our economy and producing products and services of increased value-added content. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it is the drive and acumen of our manufacturers and traders that will help us to overcome trade barriers. The Government will assist whenever possible. In response to the suggestion of the private sector, we have reorganised the Department of Trade into the Trade Development Board (TDB). The TDB will be able to adopt a more flexible and professional approach to the promotion and development of trade. The TDB has been tasked to plan new trade development programmes that will assist our manufacturers, particularly the local ones, in a more effective way to establish themselves in overseas markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our network of overseas trade offices will be expanded to help exporters seek out new market opportunities. In 1982, trade offices were opened in Jeddah and Bonn. More offices will be set up as and when needed. Apart from coordinating promotional activities in trade fairs and missions in potential markets, these trade offices will search out foreign buyers for our Singapore-made intermediate products such as electronic, electrical and engineering components and parts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982, 254 Singapore companies participated in 24 overseas trade fairs, missions and in store promotions. For 1983, the TDB will be organizing 36 trade fairs and missions to West Asia, the European Community and the United States. These fairs and missions will concentrate on specialized areas including electronic products and components, furniture, printing and publishing services, engineering subcontracting services and high fashion wear. Survey missions are also being planned to hitherto untapped markets in Africa, the Pacific islands and Latin America. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To disseminate information on markets and products, eleven marketing seminars and workshops for manufacturers and exporters were held in 1982. More of these sessions will be organized. The TDB is proceeding with plans to introduce a fully computerized trade information system by 1985. When ready, this will provide speedy access to market information for our exporters and their customers. The TDB \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will also review our present export incentives in order to see how their effectiveness can be increased. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>ASEAN</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the difficulties in world trade, I am happy to report that our regional trade under the ASEAN Preferential Trading Arrangements (PTA) has continued to grow. A total of 8,560 items enjoyed preferential treatment as at the end of 1982. In addition, an across-the-board tariff preference of 20-25% was made available for 1,149 items whose 1978 import values were between US$0.5 million and US$l million. Effective from January 1983, this ceiling was raised to US$2.5 million, resulting in another 1,000 items being eligible for the tariff concessions. To further boost intra-ASEAN trade, ASEAN Economic Ministers at their 14th Meeting in November 1982 agreed that the across-the-board tariff ceiling be raised yet again to US$10 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Financial Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for financial services in this region will continue to expand, considering that the Asia Pacific Basin has been identified as a high growth area in the coming decades. New financial centres such as Tokyo are likely to grow to meet the demand. We must therefore constantly upgrade the quality of our international and regional financial services to maintain our leading role. In addition to upgrading domestic banking services, the Monetary Authority intends to focus on three major areas in the coming year for the further development of Singapore as a financial centre. These are the consolidation of the gold market, the promotion of international loan syndication activities and the development of offshore fund management. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further promote the orderly development of the gold market, companies trading in gold will in future have to be members of the Gold Exchange of Singapore. The Gold Exchange, in consultation with the Monetary Authority, will tighten its rules and by-laws with a view to facilitating self-regulation by members of the Exchange, This will eliminate malpractices and enhance the reputation of Singapore's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> gold market. Trading in financial futures is also being studied. In particular, the possibility of merging the proposed financial futures exchange with the Gold Exchange is being explored. The study will also look into the possibility of establishing links with similar, more established exchanges in the financial capitals of the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much effort has been made to encourage loan syndication activities in Singapore. For example, measures have been taken to improve the supporting infrastructure such as tele-communications, legal and printing services. A special tax holiday scheme will be introduced in this Budget to spur loan syndication activities. I will elaborate on the details of this scheme in Part III of my Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our development as a financial centre and the success of our economic strategies have attracted a considerable inflow of funds. This has put upward pressure on the value of the Singapore dollar. The strengthening of the dollar in 1982 helped to dampen inflation imported from abroad and assisted in our economic restructuring. But our exporters had to work doubly hard to maintain their competitive edge at a time when markets were not expanding. In view of the more difficult prevailing economic conditions, we must continue to ensure that our traders and export-oriented manufacturing firms are not handicapped by an overvalued Singapore dollar or unduly high domestic interest rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tourism</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world recession has also affected our tourism industry. In 1982, we received a total of 2.96 million visitors. This represented a sharply reduced growth of 4.5% compared to the average of 11.4% growth in the preceding three years. If not for the steady flow of visitors from the more buoyant Asian markets, our tourist sector would have suffered even more. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total of 250 conventions and 42 trade fairs were held in Singapore in 1982, slightly more than in the previous year. Substantial growth in this area is not expected until the mid-80s when more \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> large-scale convention facilities come onstream. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the slowdown in the growth of tourist arrivals, hotel developments by the private sector continued at a brisk pace, stimulated no doubt by the high hotel occupancy rates over the past 5 years. At the end of 1982, Singapore had a total of 14,120 hotel rooms. A further 1,300 rooms are expected to be completed in 1983. After three years of rapidly increasing hotel room rates, there are signs that the room rates charged by our hotels are beginning to come down. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board will continue its intensive overseas promotions. It is encouraging to see that our hotels and other members of the travel industry have also stepped up their own marketing and promotion efforts. Despite the economic recession, world tourism is expected to continue growing. We must therefore make every effort to compete for a larger share of the international and regional tourist traffic. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoteliers are well aware of the labour shortage which the industry will have to contend with in the next few years. They must re-double their efforts to trim their manpower levels through well-planned job enlargement and productivity programmes. I am heartened by the hotel industry's decision to take over from the VITB, the running of the Hotel and Catering School. The new Hotel Association Training Centre will be the second training centre run by industry. Full support will be given by the Skills Development Fund for its activities and I would urge other industries to emulate this excellent example. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Computerization</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the setting up of the National Computer Board (NCB), computerization of the Civil Service has been accelerated. In the past year, new computer systems were installed in the Ministries of Labour, Environment and Finance (inland Revenue Department) bringing the number of Ministries and Government Departments with in-house computer systems to seven. Tenders for nine more computer systems have been called. By the end of 1983, 16 Ministries and Government Departments \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will have their computer systems installed. The Civil Service now employs over 350 computer professionals who are designing and implementing the various Government computerization projects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector has responded enthusiastically to the government's encouragement of computerization. The National Computer Board has estimated that almost 2,000 firms in Singapore use computers in their operations. Another 1,800 firms have plans to computerize over the next three years. Computer clubs have proliferated in schools, community centres, workers' centres and even the SAF Reservist Association. They will be instrumental in preparing Singaporeans for the computer age. A focal point this year will be \"Informatics '83\", a week-long series of activities to highlight the importance of computer information technology and how it will affect Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made good progress in manpower development for the information industry. We now have three computer training institutes as well as the Computer Science Department of the National University of Singapore. In addition to the Institute of Systems Science and the Japan Singapore Institute of Software Technology, a Centre for Computer Studies was recently set up at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The establishment of these three institutes in partnership with expertise from the United States, Japan and England will facilitate technology transfer from leading international companies to local professionals. These institutes will, in two or three years' time, be able to produce 600 to 700 new computer professionals annually. To ensure that the training of our computer professionals will meet international standards, the NCB has introduced a certification system to set national standards through public professional examinations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key target in our plan is to make Singapore a software export centre by the end of the decade. To spur the development of the software industry, the NCB will be setting up the Software Technology Centre in the Kent Ridge Science Park to attract software development companies to establish operations in Singapore. The NCB is also looking into tax incentives and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> a financial assistance scheme to encourage companies to develop software packages for export. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Manpower Development</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years now in the Budget Statement the Government had unfailingly emphasized the pivotal role that our manpower and training policies play in the restructuring of our economy. We are not alone in recognising the fundamental truth that our people are our greatest resource. Many countries are also investing heavily in the skills training of their citizens. The development strategy of many newly industrializing countries has shifted from the past cheap labour policy to one of cheap but high quality skills. We must therefore prepare ourselves to meet the competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the inevitable realities that we will have to live with is that future industries in the developed world will be highly automated and have most of their operations computerized. To attract such industries to set up operations in Singapore, we must upgrade the numeracy and literacy skills of our workforce. Knowledge in basic mathematics and the English language is of paramount importance. More than half a million of our workers have less than a primary six education. Upgrading their basic numerate and literate ability will not be an easy undertaking. It will have to be done gradually without straining our teaching resources. Early this year a pilot scheme was launched under the Basic Education for Skills Training (BEST) programme. It involved 5,000 workers from 60 firms. The scheme is being run by the Continuing Education and Training (CET) Department of the VITB. A parallel pilot scheme will also be organized by the Ministry of Defence for 1,000 National Servicemen. Workers who complete the BEST programme can qualify for VITB courses to further upgrade their skills. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, our tertiary and technical institutions are pressing ahead to train more professionals and highly skilled workers. In July 1982, the Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) received the first intake of 580 students into its practiceoriented engineering courses. In February 1982 the German-Singapore Institute \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> began its training of technicians and vocational instructors in production engineering with an initial intake of 103 students. The Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (or CadCam) Training Unit has just started operations. It will provide training in the integration of computers in the design and production processes. The French-Singapore Institute will become operational later this year. It will train highly skilled technicians in the fields of electro-technology and electronics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower training has to be carried out not only by the Government but more importantly by employers. In the current prolonged recession, companies may be tempted to reduce their commitment on training in order to trim down their costs. Not only will such action be a grave setback for Singapore but, in my view, it will also damage the ability of companies to survive beyond the present recession. Manpower training is like the old man in the Chinese fable who laid a stone each day in the river. The actions of the old man may appear foolish to the onlookers. But if the right stones are used and if there is perseverance, there will one day be a bridge which will span the river. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should therefore take advantage of the current slack in activity to improve the skills of the workforce. The Skills Development Fund will, I assure them, be more generous in providing financial assistance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Wages</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many developed countries, it is becoming increasingly true that wages have lost one of its principal macro-economic functions, namely, to register the varying productivity levels in different industries, and in this way, to channel labour and training resources into the more dynamic sectors. This explains the remarkable fact that in these developed countries, the few sectors that have succeeded in registering good growth are experiencing difficulty in finding enough workers with the required competence, in spite of exceptionally high national unemployment. For Singapore, while our \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> National Wages Council has served us admirably in the last 10 years, the continued use of the old-style NWC wage determination could in time lead to a similar erosion of the vital economic function of wages. In the middle of last year, the Government announced its intention to promote more direct bargaining between employers and unions. It is our hope that the switch to a new-style NWC will restore to wages its true role of reflecting the productivity performance of individual industries. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Productivity</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Productivity performance last year was disappointing in comparison with recent years. The lower increase in productivity of 2.0% is, however, not surprising. Utilization of plant and machinery and hotel occupancy rates have fallen because of the recession. Part of the labour force is also working on short time. As our production capacity was not put to its maximum use, productivity must suffer. The set-back in productivity improvement is, however, only temporary and does not indicate a lack of progress in our economic restructuring. It should instead spur us on to improve our productivity in order that our exports can be more competitive in world markets in these recessionary times. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years, automation and mechanization have proceeded at a rapid pace in manufacturing. However, non-industrial enterprises have not kept up with the pace set by manufacturing. Productivity improvement in the commercial sector has been slow. In fact, productivity in this sector, which includes retail trade, restaurants and hotels, fell by ,Q% and 2% in 1981 and 1982 respectively. As a result, while employment in manufacturing shrank in 1982, it increased substantially in the commerce sector. Although this has helped to maintain full employment, it portends trouble for us when the economy picks up and demand for labour increases. We may once again face a tight labour market which could undermine our economic restructuring. The problem could be worsened with the repatriation of foreign workers from non-traditional sources over the next few years. We must therefore encourage by appropriate tax incentives and other measures non-industrial enter- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> prises to automate and mechanize as rapidly as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some economists have voiced the view that productivity improvement comes principally from the use of more capital equipment and from technological changes. According to this theory, human efforts can make only a small contribution. I do not intend to debate the correctness or otherwise of such views but it is pertinent to remember that machines have to be operated, monitored and controlled by human beings. It is the accretion of small contributions in human efforts that determines the competitive edge of nations. We therefore have to continue with the drive to inculcate better work attitudes and understanding of productivity among our workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform the House that we have made good progress last year in building up a productivity movement, through the efforts of the National Productivity Council. In November 1982, the first nation-wide Productivity Month was launched to create widespread awareness of the concept of productivity and to mobilize the support of managers, supervisors, union leaders and workers. To-date, a total of 341 Quality Control Circles (QCCs), comprising 2,582 workers in 44 organizations have registered with the National Productivity Board. This is a valuable beginning from which to build up an expanding network of QCCs in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Energy and Water</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several years of oil price increases, 1982 was a year of relief for oil-consuming nations. The glut situation in the oil market which started in 1981 continued into the year and brought about stable prices. The oil market in 1983 is likely to be favourable for consumers. Lower oil prices will be of enormous help in the efforts to achieve world economic recovery and to keep inflation down. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must, however, not forget the oil crises of the Seventies. Singapore must continue to be efficient in the use of energy and eliminate wastage. In this regard, our performance in 1982 was not very encouraging. Although the growth in electricity demand dropped from 7 1/2% to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> 5.1%, the ratio of electricity demand growth to GDP growth increased from 0.75 in 1981 to 0.81 in 1982, reversing the trend of the last four years. While this reversal can be explained as the result of high consumption by the energy-intensive industries producing materials for the booming construction sector, we will have to continue paying close attention to our energy usage. Energy conservation will therefore have to be pursued with vigour. Henceforth, the Energy Conservation Centre in the PUB will become the focal point of all energy conservation promotional activities in Singapore. Our industries and other large energy consumers must be made more conscious of the need to conserve and to use energy efficiently. As we are not an energy producing country, we need to be highly efficient in our energy usage if we are to maintain our competitive edge in overseas markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts to look for alternatives to oil to meet our energy requirements are continuing. Last year I told the House that a possible alternative was natural gas which is found in substantial quantities in our neighbouring countries. Since then, we have agreed in principle with the Governments of Malaysia and Indonesia to pur- chase natural gas from their gas fields if the gas can be brought to Singapore economically and at a suitable time in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oil crisis in 1979 forced us to devote considerable attention to the energy question in the last few years. However, a subject that deserves equal importance is our water supply. With economic growth and rising standards of living, our water consumption has been rising relentlessly. We have limited land in Singapore to set aside for water catchment areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of energy, Singaporeans must learn to use water wisely and it is crucial that this be taken with the utmost seriousness. The PUB launched a Water Conservation Campaign in October 1981. The Board has since helped 2,850 large consumers to adopt conservation measures which have enabled them to reduce their consumption by 13%. It has also installed thimbles in many high-rise buildings, schools, hospitals, public toilets and other premises. Water consumption in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> these places has dropped by 12%. The reduction in water usage can be attributed partly to recession but the message that \"water is precious\" is undoubtedly starting to take root. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give renewed momentum to our water conservation drive, the PUB will launch another campaign this year in September. EDB and PUB are currently conducting a joint study on water usage in various establishments. It is hoped that we will soon be able to formulate a package of incentives and disincentives to promote water conservation in commercial and industrial enterprises. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Construction</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry is responding well to our economic needs and to the call to improve its productivity. Last year, the industry was the fastest growing sector, expanding at a rate of 36% which was more than double that in 1981. Our public housing construction programme is now in full swing. 87,000 units are under construction, 66% more than the figure a year ago. Construction costs have stabilized as the supply of building materials improved. Singaporeans aspiring to own their own homes at a price within their means can look forward to have their hopes fulfilled. Private sector construction of hotels, offices, shopping complexes and factories is proceeding with confidence at a rapid pace. This will put us in a better position to take advantage of the upswing in the world economy when it comes. It will also ensure that future economic growth will be obtained without the inflationary pressures caused by an over-heated property market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapid increase in output, the construction industry has improved its productivity. Last year, output per worker rose by 11.2%, a commendable result compared with the stagnation in 1981. There is room, however, for the industry to put in more effort to mechanize and upgrade its operations. The Government has provided various forms of assistance such as a loan scheme at concessionary \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> rates of interest, accelerated depreciation and investment allowance. As contractors can take advantage of the schemes to build up their capital equipment, I hope to see further advances in productivity in the coming years. For the construction of the MRT, a 5% margin of preference has been given to local contractors or to joint ventures with at least 50% of local ownership. It is hoped that this incentive will enable Singapore firms to benefit from and absorb the technical and other skills of their foreign counterparts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development has made progress in its plans to build up a pool of permanent construction workers. Eighteen contractors are participating in the Core Contracting Scheme of HDB. These contractors are given a preferential margin of 5% in HDB tenders but are required to employ on a permanent basis highly skilled workers and professionals, promote skill training and adopt mechanized methods of construction. Plans for the Construction Industry Training Centre have been finalized and enrolment will begin in the latter part of 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Concluding Remarks on Economic Policy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, our economic performance in 1982 was due mainly to domestic factors. In fact, without the contribution from the construction industry economic growth would have been below 4 1/2%. We can rely on these domestic factors to sustain economic growth only in the short-term and only for so long as our financial resources and business confidence last. Ultimately, our small and open economy will go under if trade, manufacturing and our exports of services do not recover. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To predict how the Singapore economy will fare this year is, in many respects, a much more difficult task than 1982. 1983 is a watershed year for the world economy and for Singapore. Will the Singapore economy be able to recover quickly from the 1982 slowdown as was the case in 1975? Or will we be heading for prolonged agony? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last eight years, the Singapore economy has become more open as industries, financial institutions and hotels have increasingly plugged themselves onto the international grid. The health of the industrialized world is therefore even more crucial now for our economic well-being. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospects of a world economic recovery in 1983 are, however, uncertain. There are increasing signs that the current recession in the industrialized world is not a typical cyclical downswing from which recovery follows as a matter of course. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, many industries in the West have not taken advantage of fast changes in technology and structural rigidities have contributed to the loss of competitiveness. Western Europe appears to be in an entrenched state of recession and its economic health has been poor for the past three years. The United States remains the beacon of hope for the world as the will to compete in new areas of technology still appears to be strong in that country. Many forecasters see the US leading the world out of the economic recession by the middle of the year. However, at the end of last year, factories in the US were operating at a post-war low of 66% capacity. Every survey of investment decisions has revealed management plans to cut down on expenditure on plant and equipment. Such uncertainty does not augur well for a sustained recovery even if there are spurts of increased consumer spending. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood of uncertainty in the international economic environment has never been more crippling. Major banks and international monetary institutions are grappling with the problem of rescheduling the vast debt payments of some developing countries. If economic recovery occurs on time, debtor countries will be better able to meet their rescheduled payments and banks which had over-lent can repair their balance sheets. However, protectionism can stall recovery or frustrate the export efforts of debtor countries. A price war among oil-producing countries, while good for consuming nations and for economic \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> recovery, could send some of the oil-producers, which have over-stretched themselves, into default. And a default by any major borrowing country could send the world into a tailspin. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world's economy can be saved from disaster by determined, co-ordinated and sustained international co-operative effort. Whether such co-operation will be forth-coming remains to be seen. But the portents are ominous. The GATT Ministerial Meeting in November 1982 failed to arrest the rising tide of protectionism. Its disappointing outcome adds to the concern that the international cooperation necessary to avert the world's drift towards an economic disaster may be a forlorn hope. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these difficult times economic policy making is particularly difficult for small countries who have no influence on external conditions. We can only hope for the best and in the meantime prepare ourselves for the worst. Through our expenditure programme and the tax changes, which I will cover in Parts 11 and Ill of my Statement, we will try to maintain the momentum of economic growth and more importantly, ensure that our firms which are producing for export, or providing services to customers overseas, stand a fighting chance of winning new markets and maintaining their existing markets in the face of increasing competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As individuals, our best contribution to Singapore's economic defence is to improve productivity at our workplaces. We have to tighten our belts and lower our expectations for wage increases in 1983. We should not fear the storm because we are well prepared. But we must expect rough going and, if we are unlucky, a drenching before the good times return. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, I propose to take the Suspension now.

Expenditure on education and manpower training; infrastructural, industrial and commercial development as well as public housing will take up $8,263 million or nearly 57% of the total allocation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $6,882 million is required to meet the recurrent expenditure of Government programmes in FY 83. This is 24% higher than the FY 82 figure. It is the minimum required to maintain the existing level of Government services and cater for expansion of essential functions such as education and manpower training as well as medical and health services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on manpower will grow by $253 million or 19%. The rate of increase is held down by a net total reduction of 1,803 posts on the permanent establishment. A total of 4,152 posts is no longer required because of the merger of the Postal Services Department with the Telecommunications Authority of Singapore, conversion of the Department of Trade into a statutory body and the new method of paying trainee medical ancillary staff from block votes instead of from the provisions \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for established posts. The reduction in manpower is partly offset by a total of 2,349 posts provided for new or expanded areas of work. Of these, 2,027 are for the Ministry of Education to meet staffing shortfalls in the schools and Ministry and to regularise the position of Government teachers posted to aided schools and junior colleges. Most of the remaining 322 new posts are taken up by the Medical, Engineering and Prison Welfare Services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding the Armed Forces expenditure, Other Operating Expenditure will go up by $60 million or 10%. Of the increase, payment of agency fees to the Urban Redevelopment Authority for managing the sale of state lands will account for $20 million. The balance is largely to meet higher costs of maintenance, rental, supplies and materials. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a jump of $351 million or 49% in Grants, Subsidies and Other Transfers. This is attributed mainly to :- \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n  * the 1982 salary revision, annual salary\r\n\r\n      increments, increase in CPF/MPF con-\r\n\r\n      tributions and a contingency provision\r\n\r\n      for the NWC wage supplement in FY\r\n\r\n      83 for the staff of statutory boards,\r\n\r\n      tertiary education institutions and\r\n\r\n      aided schools;\r\n\r\n  * a sum of $153 million to top up the\r\n\r\n      Advance Accounts; and\r\n\r\n  * an allocation of $40 million to\r\n\r\n      augment the Contingencies Fund for\r\n\r\n      recurrent expenditure.\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the increase of $395 million or 29% in the provision for Public Debt is to meet interest payments on domestic loans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recurrent expenditure will be fully met by the anticipated revenue of $8,871 million, leaving a surplus of $1,989 million for transfer to the Development Fund to help finance development projects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total development expenditure for FY 83 is estimated to be $7,789 million or 53% of the net total budget. The provision is 14% more than that for FY 82. Outlays on public housing, infrastructural, industrial and commercial development as well as education and manpower training account for $6,645 million or 85% of the development bud et. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some $3,102 million or nearly 40% of the development budget is set aside for the public housing construction programme. HDB expects to complete about 40,200 units in FY 83. This is 74% higher than the target set for FY 82. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infrastructural, industrial and commercial development account for $2,966 million or 38% of the development outlay. This includes $1,240 million for lines of credit to the Development Bank of Singapore, the Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore and the Ship Financing Scheme; $1,060 million for the development of the Kent Ridge Science and Technology Park, industrial estates, reservoirs, mass rapid transit system, roads and Changi Airport, Phase II, as well as $143 million for the Capital Assistance Scheme for the Construction Industry, and the Economic Development Board's Capital Assistance Scheme and Product Development Assistance Scheme. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure on education and manpower training will take up $577 million. This is for the School and Junior College Building Programme, construction of a new complex for the Nanyang Technological Institute and expansion of the Kent Ridge Campus of the National University of Singapore, Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic as well as vocational and industrial training institutes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Service computerization programme is allocated $69 million for the purchase of hardware and software development. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Section III</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Revenue</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the third part of my Statement which deals with revenue and tax changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY 83 recurrent revenue is estimated at $8,871 million, which represents a decrease of $452 million or 4.8% compared with the revised estimates of $9,323 million for FY 82. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax is still the largest single source of revenue accounting for nearly 35% of total revenue. Income tax collec \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tions for FY 83 are expected to reach $3,100 million, a fall of $200 million or 6.1% from FY 82 collections. The main reason for this decline is because the corporate sector is expected to have smaller profits. Corporate taxes account for 74% of the total income tax for FY 83. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total budgetted expenditure for FY 83 is $14,671 million comprising recurrent expenditure of $6,882 million and development expenditure of $7,789 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after taking into account the Development Fund income of $2,058 million, the total revenue of $10,929 million is insufficient to finance total recurrent and development expenditures. The deficit of $3,742 million has to be financed by public borrowings and a drawing-down from the Development Fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Changes</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members will no doubt be interested to know what will be the tax changes proposed in this Budget. I hasten to assure them that, for FY 83, there will be no increases in the rates of Income Tax. Instead I intend to give three concessions to encourage the older workers and speially qualified married women to remain in the workforce and thereby contribute to our economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Earned Income Relief for Taxpayers Beyond the Age of 55 Years</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1976 the earned income relief for individuals aged over 55 years old was increased from $1,000 to $2,000 and that for individuals aged over 60 years old from $1,000 to $3,000 as they need more money to stay healthy and continue working beyond their normal retirement age. To further encourage them to remain in the workforce and to take account of the cost and pressures of the elderly in working life, I have decided to increase the earned income relief from $2,000 to $3,000 for those over 55 years old, and from $3,000 to $4,000 for those over 60 years old. The increase in earned income relief will take effect from the Year of Assessment 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue loss is estimated at $2.4 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Earned Income Relief for Handicapped Persons of 55 Years Old and Above</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1982 the earned income relief for handicapped persons was increased from $1,000 to $2,000. However, when a handicapped person continues to work beyond the age of 55 years, he can only claim the increased earned income relief either as a handicapped person or as an elderly person. It is appropriate to give recognition and encouragement to a handicapped person who continues to work beyond retirement age. I have therefore decided that such a person should be given earned income relief of $2,000 as a handicapped person as well as the earned income relief of either $3,000 or $4,000 for continuing to work beyond the age of 55 years or 60 years, as the case may be. This tax concession will also take effect from the Year of Assessment 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Enhanced Child Relief for Specially Qualified Married Women</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, all specially qualified married women can claim enhanced child relief for up to three eligible children. For the first and second child, the relief is $2,000 or 5% of the woman's earned income and for the third child, it is $2,000 or 3% of her earned income, whichever is the lesser. This enhanced relief was given with effect from the Year of Assessment 1974 to encourage the more highly qualified married women to continue to work even after they have children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the cost of domestic help has gone up, I am improving the existing enhanced child reliefs by removing the limit placed on such reliefs but the reliefs will still be confined to the first three eligible children. With effect from Year of Assessment 1983 the enhanced child relief will be the normal child relief plus 5% of the woman's annual earned income for each of the first three eligible children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost to revenue is estimated at $1.4 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Changes for Companies</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have gathered from Part I of my Statement that I expect 1983 to be a grim year with only minimal economic \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> growth. Indeed we shall be doing well if we can limit the number of retrenchments and create enough jobs to continue to provide full employment for our citizens. This will depend on our corporate sector remaining strong and vigorous. To give a stimulus to companies in these difficult times, I have decided to give the following concessions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Loan Syndication</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asia Pacific region has been identified as a high growth area in this decade. There will consequently be greater demand for financial services in this region. In addition to providing continuing encouragement for the upgrading of domestic banking services, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is promoting international loan syndication activities as part of the further development of Singapore as an international financial centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efforts made to develop loan syndication activities in Singapore include measures taken to improve the supporting infrastructure such as telecommunications, legal and printing services. A special tax holiday scheme will now be introduced to further promote loan syndication activities. Under the scheme, all income derived by the Asian Currency Units (ACUs) of banks and financial institutions in Singapore from loans syndicated in Singapore within the next five years beginning from 1st April, 1983 and for such further period as the Minister for Finance may approve, shall be exempt from tax if the loans meet the following requirements: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The lead manager is an ACU of a financial institution in Singapore. If there are two or more lead managers, at least half of that number should be financial institutions in Singapore; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Ministry of Finance is satisfied that the larger part of the whole syndication process is done in Singapore; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) There are at least three lenders; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The loan is an offshore loan [as defined under Section 3(a) of the Income Tax (Concessionary Rate of Tax for Asian Currency Unit Income) Regulations, 19791. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax exemption on income from syndicated loans will be granted on a case-by-case basis. However, there will be flexibi- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> lity in the implementation of the scheme and the tax exemption will be applied to all income earned during the entire period, or tenure, of the loan. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Stamp Duty on Cheques and Traveller's Cheques</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with our development as a financial centre, stamp duty on all cheques, including traveller's cheques, will be abolished with effect from 1st April, 1983. Travellers will now find it easier to encash their cheques and banks will be relieved of the administrative burden of accounting for all cheques issued to their account holders. The imposition of stamp duty is anachronistic and inequitable, particularly when there are in existence other similar banking facilities such as credit cards, cash dispensers and automated tellers, and the Giro system which do not attract stamp duty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss in revenue is estimated at $6.2 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax on Royalties</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an encouragement to creative talents such as authors and composers, a tax concession will be given on royalties received. With effect from Year of Assessment 1984, the chargeable income will be deemed to be only 10% of the royalties. However, where an author or composer is entitled to claim as deductible expenses under existing tax provisions more than 90% of the royalties, (ie his chargeable income is less than 10%) this will continue to apply as it provides the author or composer with greater benefits. This concession will enable local publishers to offer better terms to authors and composers living in Singapore and abroad. Foreign talents will find it worthwhile to get their works published here. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>First Year Depreciation for Computers and Office Automation Equipment</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remain competitive, we must pursue efficiency relentlessly, not only in the fac- tory but also in the office. Manufacturing enterprises are presently allowed to write-off their plant and equipment over three years. I propose to give some encouragement to non-manufacturing enter- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> prises to modernize their operations. With effect from Year of Assessment 1984 all expenditure on computers and office automation equipment can enjoy 100% depreciation in the first year. This means that expenditure on such equipment can be written-off completely against taxable profits in the year following the year of purchase. If the enterprise does not have sufficient profits to take full advantage of the 100% depreciation allowance, the balance will be available for deduction in subsequent years. Residual allowance from Year of Assessment 1983 in respect of such equipment will also be available for full set-off in 1984. 1 hope that all enterprises in Singapore, both manufacturing as well as non-manufacturing, will take advantage of this concession to automate and mechanize their operations as rapidly as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I come to the tax increases. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on Cigarettes and Tobacco</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties on cigarettes and tobacco were last revised in March 1980 by harmonizing excise duty with import duty. The increased duties, however, did not have any effect in discouraging smoking. In fact, consumption of cigarettes increased from 3.9 million kilograms in 1979 to 4.0 million kilograms in 1980. It went up further to 4.2 million kilograms in 1981. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with our policy to discourage smoking, the duties on cigarettes and tobacco will be raised again. The import duty on cigarettes, cigars, cheroots and cigarillos will be increased from $45 per kilogram to $50 per kilogram; while the excise duty on cigarettes will be raised from $9 per kilogram to $14 per kilogram. As part of the move towards the harmonization of duties, excise duties will be introduced on beedies, snuff and other tobacco products at the existing import duty rates. Details of the revision are set out in Appendix I (Cols. 441 - 442). I will ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute Appendix I to Members. (Copies distributed to hon. Members.) \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1983/19830304/19830304-HA-0420441.htm\">Appendix I - DUTIES ON CIGARETTES AND TOBACCO (Cols. 441 - 442)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision in duties on cigarettes and tobacco, which is expected to yield about $15 million, will come into effect today. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duty on Liquors</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from today the import and excise duties on intoxicating liquors excluding beer and stout, will be revised. The import and excise duties on brandy, gin, rum, whisky, liqueurs and bitters in bottle form will be increased to $210 per decalitre (dal), while the import and excise duties on brandy, gin, rum, whisky, liqueurs and bitters in bulk form, vodka, ethyl alcohol and other spirituous liquors will be increased to $280 per proof dal. The import and excise duties for arrack and pineapple spirit will be increased to $130 per proof dal, shandy exceeding 2% but not exceeding 5% proof strength and shandy not exceeding 2% proof strength will be harmonized at $11 per dal and $10 per dal respectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New excise duties will be introduced for grape must, still wines and vermouths, sparkling wines, cider and perry, sake and mead and other fermented fruit juices. Details of the revision in import and excise duties on intoxicating liquors are listed out in Appendix II (Cols. 443 - 446). (Copies distributed to hon. Members.) \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1983/19830304/19830304-HA-0420443.htm\">Appendix II - DUTIES ON LIQUORS (Cols. 443 - 446)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional revenue yield is estimated at $4 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Duties on Petroleum Products</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the policy on harmonization of duties, excise duties will be introduced on two petroleum products - benzole and benzene - at the existing import duty rate of $2.86 per dal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new excise duty takes effect immediately. There is no revenue gain because here is as yet no local manufacture of benzole and benzene. (Appendix III, Cols. 445 - 446). (Copies distributed to hon. Members.) \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1983/19830304/19830304-HA-0420445.htm\">Appendix III - DUTIES ON PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (Cols. 445 - 446)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Deduction for Expenses on Private Hire Cars</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a marked increase in the number of private hire cars, commonly known as 'SZ' cars, in recent years, Cars are hired by companies not only for short term use by their executives but also to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> replace their company registered cars or 'Q' cars. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company which hires the 'SZ' cars can claim full tax deduction for rentals and expenses while the car rental companies can claim full capital allowances on the car. If the company had purchased its own company registered car, the capital allowances would be limited to $35,000 and the tax deduction for expenses would be restricted to the proportion of the total expenses that the $35,000 bear to the capital expenditure of the car. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although full tax deduction on expenses and capital allowances is granted only if the 'SZ' car is not rented to the same person for more than six months in a year, companies have circumvented this restriction by changing cars every six months. This arrangement confers unintended tax benefits to both the rentee company and the car rental company at the expense of revenue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1st April, 1983 no tax deduction will be given for the whole amount of rentals and expenses incurred in the hire if the company or business enterprise hires 'SZ' cars for periods which, in aggregate, exceed 183 days in the accounting year. If the rental periods of the 'SZ' cars overlap, the overlapping periods will be counted only once for the purpose of determining the 183 days limit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Concluding Remarks</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the tone of my Budget Statement this year is sombre, reflecting the gravity of the economic malaise that has been afflicting the world since 1980. And more grave problems lie ahead. World trade is shrinking. Protectionism is rising. Commodity prices are depressed. Many countries are being forced to pursue deflationary policies all at the same time. Output has declined, throwing many workers out of their jobs. The international banking system is threatened with a breakdown as a result of the massive debt problems of a number of developing countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of these troubles we can take comfort that, through prudent management and stringent avoidance of waste, we have accumulated sufficient \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> resources to enable us to avoid having to cut back on our development programme. We can take advantage of these recessionary times to build up our infrastructure, both human and physical. We will build more public housing, more schools, more roads, more offices, more factories, more harbours and the MRT. We will continue to improve our education system, both in the schools as well as in our institutions of higher learning. We must not falter in our drive to train our workers, sharpening their skills and enhancing their expertise. And it is when the going gets rough that the importance of cooperation, of working as a team, of discipline and cohesiveness can be brought home to Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot promise Members that Singapore will remain unscathed if there should be a global economic crisis triggered off by the default of a major debtor country or the failure of a large international bank. But I can say confidently that we have the resources and the determination to ensure that our physical and social fabric will not suffer permanent damage. When the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> storm ends, and all storms no matter how severe must end, we will emerge a fitter, stronger and better nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1983 to 31st March, 1984.\" Inaccordance with paragraph (1) of Standing Order No. 84, the debate now stands adjourned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate to be resumed on what day, Dr Tan? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> On Monday, 14th March, 1983, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> So be it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to Monday, 14th March, 1983.\" - [Mr E.W.

'O' or 'A' level qualifications as well as trained persons as relief teachers on a temporary arrangement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In 1982, there were an average of 1032 relief teachers employed each month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) A relief teacher is employed on a daily basis and is paid according to his qualifications as follows: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n   Trained graduate               --     $55.54 per day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Trained non-graduate           --     $41.16 per day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Untrained graduate             --     $34.97 per day\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Untrained non-graduate         --     $20.72 per day\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A relief teacher is paid for the days that he works. He is not paid during public and school holidays. The appointment can be terminated at any time by the relief teacher or the school on one day's notice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Except for 25 schools and junior colleges, the other 422 employed relief teachers at one time or another during 1982 to meet their staffing needs. No list of schools will be provided as the number of relief teachers in a school is not static but changes during the year. This depends on exigencies such as maternity and sick leave and study leave. The duration of service of relief teachers is likewise variable. The majority serve for less than 1 year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONSTRUCTION BRIGADE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Rohan bin Kamis -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Rohan bin Kamis</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if he will report on the progress of the Construction Brigade. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Since October 1981, when the Construction Brigade had its first intake of 94 National Servicemen, the strength of the Brigade has to date grown to 1,657. There is an intake every quarter. So far, there have been 6 intakes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction Brigade trainees spend the first 3 months of National Service on basic training at the Civil Defence School and VITB Centres. They are paid a basic allowance of $90 during this period, similar to what other National Servicemen in the SAF and Police are getting. Civil Defence School gives them training in basic discipline to work as a member of an organised force. VITB training provides the vocational qualifications for on-the-job (OJT) training at HDB worksites during the next 9 months. Those with the necessary qualifications and aptitude are taught specialised trades such as electrical wiring, lift mechanics and prefabrication. The others take up building trades such as bar-bending, brick laying, painting, tiling, pipe fining, carpentry and plastering. Altogether, 10 trades are available for the trainees to specialise in, although only 8 trades were available when the training scheme was first implemented. While on on-the-job training, the trainees are paid a monthly National Service allowance of $110 plus a food and transport allowance of $10 per working day. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st December, 1982, 342 out of 418 trainees from the first and second intakes had completed on-the-job training and had been disrupted from full-time National Service and are employed by HDB contractors to work in construction sites. They are paid market rates of wages and CPF benefits like any other construction worker. Their take home pay averages $25 (between $23 to $28) daily, comparable to what other construction workers of equivalent skill are earning. The other 76 are still on OJT and will enter the open market for construction jobs by March 1983. 916 trainees from the third, fourth and fifth intakes are presently at HDB worksites receiving their 9 months' on-the-job training. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of 18 months employment with HDB contractors, the Construction Brigade trainees will be liable for reserve service in the Civil Defence Emergency Response Units. The skills and experience they have acquired on HDB worksites will stand them in good stead in civil employment as well as in their role as Civil Defence reservists. The first batch of Construction Brigade trainees will go into the Civil Defence as reservists in mid-1984. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give value to the trade training at VITB and the work experience, Construction Brigade trainees are eligible to take a trade test - the Certificate of Competency Test - one year after commencement of VITB training. So far, the first, second and third batches are eligible to register and sit for the test. 50 out of 94 trainees of the first intake were tested, of whom 43 passed. 257 out of 636 from the second and third intakes have registered for the trade test. They will sit for their examinations in the next few months. These certificates of competency will enhance employment prospects of the trainees after their release from the free market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under discussion with HDB is a proposal to introduce cash awards for the best Construction Brigade Trainee On-the-Job for each intake and the most Safety Conscious Trainee for the month.

The question of national service allowance has been debated in this House on numerous occasions. MINDEF has studied the problem carefully, weighing the pros and cons. Members may wish to note that an increase of $10 per month in the allowance would result in an additional cost of over $7 million a year for MINDEF. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we have now decided to make some adjustments to the initial allowance of $90 for National Service recruits. Details are being worked out. We expect to finalize them before the middle of the year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding our decision to revise the allowance, two important points must be stressed. Firstly, national servicemen's allowance must not be confused with wages or salary. The allowance is meant only as contribution towards personal upkeep and expenses over and above those borne by the SAF, like food and lodging for those staying in camp. It is not for services rendered. The element of sacrifice on the part of national servicemen must be stressed. Their reward is peace and security for their country and family. We must continue to remind our national servicemen that it is their duty and honour to serve the nation. At the age of 18, they have enjoyed 18 years of peace and progress made possible only by the sacrifices of their elder brothers, cousins, friends and neighbours who served the nation before them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as in the past, every national serviceman who experiences genuine financial difficulties in his family will be assisted through loans for those who are single, and outright grants for those who are married. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NATION-WIDE POWER FAILURE ON 5TH FEBRUARY, 1983</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. \n  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what cause or causes led to the major nation-wide power failure on Saturday, 5th February, 1983; and (b) what steps will be taken to prevent a similar occurrence in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> I would like to take advantage of this question to explain not only what caused the island-wide power failure on Saturday, 5th February, 1983, but also why it took many hours to restore full supply, and finally what we can do to minimize disruption and danger to life in the event of a power failure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power failure on 5th February, 1983, occurred as a result of a severe short circuit at a new section of the 230 kilovolt switchboard being installed and tested at Senoko Power Station Stage III which is under construction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short circuit was so severe that it created a surge of power equivalent to five times the power being generated to supply the entire Republic at that time. The extreme overload severely disturbed the electricity supply system and led to the tripping (automatic disconnection from the system) in rapid succession of the generators at Jurong, Senoko and Pasir Panjang Power Stations. All the power stations were affected because they are interlinked through the Republic's electricity supply network. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power failure did not occur because of insufficient generating capacity. At present, the daily peak demand for electricity is about 1,350 MW but the total generating capacity of all the power stations is about 2,100 MW. There is therefore more than sufficient generating capacity to cater for Singapore's demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now explain our electricity supply system and why it took several hours to restore full supply to the island. In a power station fuel is burned in the boilers which produce high pressure steam. This steam is used to drive the turbine-generators to generate electricity. Electricity generated at power stations is fed to four major 230 kilovolt substations through the 230 kilovolt cable transmission system. From there, electricity is distributed to consumers via some 3,600 substations and more than 33,000 km of their associated cable systems. This system of inter-linking power stations and substations through cables constitutes our electricity supply network. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all major electricity supply systems, Singapore's power stations are linked through the network. This has been found by practice to be the most efficient and economical mode of operation and affords flexibility and reliability. During a planned shutdown for overhaul and maintenance of equipment at one power station, electricity can be supplied from the other power stations. More important, if there is a fault in one power station causing a generator to trip, the other power stations with reserve capacity (or, in technical jargon, spinning reserve) will automatically take over the load thereby preventing power failure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, an attendant disadvantage in such a system in that an extraordinary fault at one power station may affect the other power stations by virtue of the fact that they are linked. On 5th February, 1983, such an extraordinary fault occurred, causing such a severe overload that it tripped out all the generators in operation within seconds, nullifying the back-up system of spinning reserve. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is a total collapse of the electricity supply system, restoration of supply takes time because established safety procedures have to be followed. When the generators trip, the boilers go out and the fuel pipes to the boiler have to be shut down. The furnaces then have to be cleared of remnant oil vapour otherwise the boilers may explode on ignition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the boilers have been started, it takes time to build up high pressure steam. The turbine-generators have to be run-up slowly and it takes about an hour before the generator can transmit any electricity into the system. There are technical and practical limitations to the speed at which the boilers and the turbine-generators can be loaded. This is a slow process because fast loading will damage the turbine-generators. The speed at which supplies are restored has also to be balanced with the rate of generation, otherwise the system might collapse again. That is why restoration of supply could only be started three hours after the system collapsed on 5th February, 1983. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This procedure of restarting the electricity supply system is universally followed by all utility authorities irrespective of the type of generator or boiler in use. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we prevent a recurrence of the particular fault that led to the island-wide power failure on 5th February, 1983? The answer is obviously yes. We can tighten up the precautions to be taken prior to carrying out testing of new high voltage equipment in the electricity supply system. This is being done by the PUB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we ensure that we will never ever have an island-wide power failure? The answer, both theoretically and practically, is No - so long as our power stations are interlinked with automatic transfer of load from one station to another as the need arises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, then, do we not change our system and instead have each power station service a separate, self-contained sub-network? The reason is because such a system has its own grave disadvantages. If a fault develops at one of the power stations, electricity would not be supplied automatically from another power station and the net result is that area blackouts would be more frequent and more prolonged. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981 and 1982, there were 77 occasions when one or more generators in our three power stations tripped. However, because our power stations are linked in a network, the other generators were able to pick up the load and only on seven occasions were there power failures covering large parts of the Republic. In other words, the interlinking of the three power stations prevented 7O major power failures. This would not have been possible if the three power stations were not interlinked. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if the stations were not linked the generating capacity of each power station would have to be increased to even out the load if a particular generator in the power station was malfunctioning. This means higher costs and therefore higher electricity tariffs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a linked network system the generating capacity of the power stations are, in effect, pooled thus allowing economical operation since the more efficient generators can be used to supply a large percentage of the total load. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking all things into consideration the PUB, in common with all major electricity supply systems in the world, has decided that the linked network system is superior and, considering that the last island-wide power failure occurred 17 years ago in 1965, I think that the decision is correct. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, what can we do to minimize disruption and danger to life in the event of power failures? First, we can and we have installed standby generators in essential service installations such as waterworks, gasworks, hospitals and the airports. These standby generators can be started up during power failures. Secondly, high-rise public and commercial buildings, shopping complexes and hotels are required, under the Building Control Regulations, to instal standby generators, which, during a power failure, will automatically be started up to bring all the lifts down to the first storey and open the doors. The standby generators also operate the fireman's lift, fire-fighting facilities and emergency lighting in the building. Thirdly, industries, commercial and other organizations which, because of the nature of their business, cannot tolerate power failures, should likewise instal standby generators. However, all standby systems must be properly maintained and serviced regularly so that they will work during emergencies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With over 70% of our population living in HDB estates, we must clearly pay special attention to making sure that people are not trapped in lifts in HDB flats during power failures. I am happy to note that HDB has taken the lead to instal automatic rescue devices to bring lifts down to the nearest floor and open automatically in the event of a power failure. HDB has 5,559 lifts in their estates and they have installed these automatic rescue devices in about 5,400. The remaining 159 lifts are old and HDB intends to replace them. The management corporations of high-rise apartment buildings should follow HDB's example and install these devices for the safety of residents in the apartment buildings. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font
