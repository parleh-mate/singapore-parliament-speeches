The Government is giving a  generous  offset\r\n\r\npackage  to restore each household's buying power.  There  is\r\n\r\nno  need  for  Singaporeans to resort to travelling  overseas\r\n\r\njust to shop for daily necessities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When GST was introduced in 1994, inflation was hardly\r\n\r\nnoticeable.   And the 2% increase in GST this  time  is  less\r\n\r\nthan the 3% in 1994.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GST is chargeable on imports. The GST exemption limit\r\n\r\nper  person re-entering Singapore is only $50 if he  is  away\r\n\r\nless than 24 hours.  This means that he only saves $1 for the\r\n\r\n2%  increase  in  GST.   These small  little  savings  should\r\n\r\ngenerate  little incentive for Singaporeans to shop overseas,\r\n\r\nsimply to avoid the increase in GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, if against our expectations leakage does\r\n\r\nbecome  a problem, the Government will consider lowering  the\r\n\r\nexemption limits.  GST is an important source of revenue.  We\r\n\r\nshould  not allow it to be undermined by large-scale overseas\r\n\r\nshopping.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, could the DPM\r\n\r\nconsider  imposing a cap on the quantity to  be  brought  in,\r\n\r\nsay, similar to the three-quarter tank rule for petrol?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it will be\r\n\r\ndifficult to decide on the appropriate amount of toilet paper\r\n\r\nrolls  to  bring  back from Johor Baru - three-quarter  roll.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not so much the $50 limit as the difficulty of\r\n\r\nenforcing the requirement.  Because, sometimes, you may  come\r\n\r\nback  with  somewhat  more than $50, and  you  may  not  have\r\n\r\ndeclared  it  and  the Customs does not  check  every  single\r\n\r\nvehicle going through.  So we will monitor the situation.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand Mr Ong Ah Heng's problem because the shops and the\r\n\r\nshopping  centres  in  the northern  part  of  Singapore,  in\r\n\r\nYishun, also in Woodlands, are affected when the residents go\r\n\r\noverseas to shop.  And if this becomes a problem, we will see\r\n\r\nwhat we need to do to tighten up, either reduce the limits or\r\n\r\nto tighten up on enforcement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VEGETABLES IMPORTED FROM MALAYSIA</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment (a) whether the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvegetables  imported from Malaysia are safe for  consumption;\r\n\r\n(b)  how many cases of vegetables imported from Malaysia have\r\n\r\nbeen detected by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA)\r\n\r\nto  contain  pesticide levels which are  below  international\r\n\r\nstandards since January this year;  and (c) whether there are\r\n\r\nother sources of supplies of vegetables.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Agri-food and Veterinary\r\n\r\nAuthority  (AVA)  inspects and tests all imported  vegetables\r\n\r\nfor  pesticide residues and other harmful chemicals to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they are safe to eat.

The intensity of these  sampling\r\n\r\ntests  would depend upon the past history of these  types  of\r\n\r\nvegetables and of the importer who has brought them in.  With\r\n\r\nall  these  measures in place, we are sure that by  the  time\r\n\r\nthese  vegetables  reach  your  plate,  they  are  safe   for\r\n\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his point about diversifying our sources, we\r\n\r\nalready  import  from  32 different countries  and,  although\r\n\r\nMalaysia is still our largest source of vegetables, as I said\r\n\r\nearlier, other sources include China, Indonesia and Australia\r\n\r\nand  these  sources have been increasing over the passage  of\r\n\r\ntime.  So I want to reassure Singaporeans that the vegetables\r\n\r\nare  safe.  In fact, vegetables are good for their health  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  what our children may say, and we have  more  than\r\n\r\nadequate sources for obtaining vegetables.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I\r\n\r\nknow  how  the sample tests are conducted?

The food provided in factories\r\n\r\nin the industrial area used to be cheap and good, much to the\r\n\r\ndelight of the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for all these canteens, the benefit of low\r\n\r\nrental is normally granted for nine years only. Once the nine-year  period is up, the operators will have to re-tender  for\r\n\r\nthe right to operate, and the tender is inevitably awarded to\r\n\r\nthe  highest  bidder.  At present, more than 10 canteens  are\r\n\r\naffected.   The new rental is  more than double that  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious one. I understand that in Jurong, the rental  ranges\r\n\r\nfrom  $13,000 to $70,000, whereas in Chai Chee, it is between\r\n\r\n$23,000 and $63,000.  With high rental, the operation cost is\r\n\r\nnaturally high. Consequently, the food prices must go up, and\r\n\r\nthe  customers  stay  away. Most of  the  operators  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  sustain their business  after  six  months  of\r\n\r\noperation.  Soon, the canteens close down,  and  the  workers\r\n\r\nhave  no food to eat.  Something must be done to prevent this\r\n\r\nunhappy situation from happening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the bulk of customers of the canteens in the\r\n\r\nfactories  are  the workers themselves, cheap and  good  food\r\n\r\nmust  be provided for the workers.  I would suggest that  JTC\r\n\r\nlearn  from the Nanyang Technological University or the  Ngee\r\n\r\nAnn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolytechnic.   They  have  a fixed  rental  system  and  only\r\n\r\nexperienced operators are invited to operate their  canteens.\r\n\r\nThe rental is clearly stated in the contract, so are the menu\r\n\r\nprices of the food served therein. This is to ensure that the\r\n\r\nfood  provided  there is good and cheap. With  this  kind  of\r\n\r\noperation,  the  stallholders, the workers as  well  as   the\r\n\r\ncanteen operators will benefit.  This is an ideal system.   I\r\n\r\nwill  encourage our people to have an entrepreneurial spirit.\r\n\r\nThe  nine-year   tenancy  period is too short.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will review the nine-year period.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Sir, many MPs, both during the Budget debate and under\r\n\r\nMTI's cuts yesterday, have expressed concerns for SMEs.   The\r\n\r\n2%  increase in GST will make an already difficult  situation\r\n\r\nfor them more difficult.  It is right that their problems are\r\n\r\nfully  aired  in this House.  Under the cuts on  SMEs  later,\r\n\r\nSenior Minister of State Tharman will cover the many specific\r\n\r\nprogrammes  we  have in place to help our  SMEs  during  this\r\n\r\nperiod  of economic downturn.  Minister of State Raymond  Lim\r\n\r\nwill address later the issue of entrepreneurship raised by Dr\r\n\r\nJohn  Chen and the progress of energy deregulation raised  by\r\n\r\nMr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, this year will be a better year than last\r\n\r\nyear.  The improved economic situation will provide relief to\r\n\r\nmany  SMEs.   The key is the overall health of  our  economy.\r\n\r\nOur economy bottomed in the third quarter of last year with a\r\n\r\nquarter-on-quarter annualised contraction of 10.5%.   In  the\r\n\r\nlast quarter of last year, we turned sharply upwards, growing\r\n\r\nby  5.6%.   The first quarter of this year saw even  stronger\r\n\r\ngrowth, 7.7%.  This is the arrow tip, the indicator of growth\r\n\r\nmomentum.  If the trend of economic recovery continues in the\r\n\r\nUS  and  in the world's semiconductor industry, and  provided\r\n\r\nnothing  untoward  happens in the region around  us,  we  are\r\n\r\nlikely to achieve growth in the upper half of our revised  2-4% projection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to the first half of next year, we can be reasonably\r\n\r\nhopeful of good, though\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  spectacular growth.  Beyond that, it is anyone's  guess.\r\n\r\nEconomists are divided over the robustness of the present  US\r\n\r\nrecovery.   The  latest  data show that  consumption  remains\r\n\r\nstrong  in  the  US,  despite  the  depressed  stock  market.\r\n\r\nCorporate  profits  are  still  down.   US  Federal   Reserve\r\n\r\nChairman, Alan Greenspan, said recently that this  is  to  be\r\n\r\nexpected.   The  sequence is inventory rebuilding,  increased\r\n\r\nsales,   then  profits  go  up,  finally,  leading   to   new\r\n\r\ninvestments.    For   a  cautious  man,  he   is   cautiously\r\n\r\noptimistic.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can, therefore, expect the overall economic situation\r\n\r\nin  Singapore to improve in the coming months.  When I bumped\r\n\r\ninto  the Chairman of UMC, Robert Tsao, a few weeks  ago,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that  there  was  a  strong uptick  in  the  wafer  fab\r\n\r\nbusiness.   Both  UMC  and TSMC are now  recruiting  workers.\r\n\r\nThere  will be a lag before growth in orders spreads  to  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the economy.  But many SMEs who supply to MNCs  are\r\n\r\nalready feeling the change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because employment lags growth by two to three quarters,\r\n\r\nthe  employment  situation may get a little worse  before  it\r\n\r\ngets better towards the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong, Miss Low, Dr Chen, Dr Chong and Mr Wee\r\n\r\nexpressed  concern  about our international  competitiveness.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  Singapore remains highly competitive.   Throughout\r\n\r\nthe  Asian financial crisis and the last global downturn, our\r\n\r\ninvestment   pipeline   remained  full.    Despite   the   2%\r\n\r\ncontraction  last year, EDB was able to achieve FDI  of  $9.2\r\n\r\nbillion  and,  throughout the Asian crisis, we maintained  $8\r\n\r\nbillion to $9 billion every year.  This year, we are on track\r\n\r\nto  reach  $9.2  billion.   The figures  for  Total  Business\r\n\r\nSpending has been correspondingly strong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong and Miss Low enquired about the fall in\r\n\r\nSingapore's competitiveness rankings.  In the latest IMD  and\r\n\r\nEIU  rankings,  we have been overtaken by European  countries\r\n\r\nlike  Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands.  This was largely\r\n\r\ndue to the recession last year which followed an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunexpected 10% growth the year before.  However, our  ranking\r\n\r\nin  Asia  remains high.  The EIU report now ranks us  as  the\r\n\r\nmost  attractive  business location in Asia,  ahead  of  Hong\r\n\r\nKong.   BERI continues to put the quality of our labour force\r\n\r\nat  the  top  of  the  chart.  Our  political  stability  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  efficiency  set us  apart.   Two  days  ago,  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times reported Transparency International pushing  us\r\n\r\nup  two notches in the world ranking on absence of corruption\r\n\r\nto   9th   place.   This  year,  PERC  rated  us  the   least\r\n\r\nbureaucratic country in the world.  I know many MPs may  find\r\n\r\nthis  difficult  to  believe  but,  really,  when  we  travel\r\n\r\noverseas,  we  realise  how much worse the  bureaucracies  in\r\n\r\nother countries can be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we are in a relatively good position for the\r\n\r\nnext  few  years, and our economy will pick up as the  global\r\n\r\neconomy picks up, we must be prepared for major challenges in\r\n\r\nthe  medium term.  This is the reason why the work of the ERC\r\n\r\nis  so important.  The tax restructuring, which is debated so\r\n\r\nintensely in this House, is of crucial importance to our long-term  competitiveness.   No  one  will  want  to  invest   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  unless  he  can make good profits,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhether he is a Singaporean or a foreigner.  Lowering  direct\r\n\r\ntaxes  puts  us  in a much better position.  Lowering  direct\r\n\r\ntaxes  makes EDB's work much easier and, if EDB  is  able  to\r\n\r\nbring in the big investments into Singapore, there will be  a\r\n\r\nlot of feeding for the SMEs.  But, if the big investments  do\r\n\r\nnot  come in, then whatever we do for SMEs will have  limited\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making fundamental adjustments to stay ahead in a\r\n\r\nglobal  game  that  has  become  more  challenging,  and  our\r\n\r\nwillingness to do this is noticed by others.  Just the  other\r\n\r\nday, the principal adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl for many\r\n\r\nyears,  Dr  Horst Telschik, was in Singapore  for  an  Asian-German  Forum.  I was invited as a Guest Speaker.   He  said,\r\n\r\n\"You  have  the  will to change.  We have lost  our  will  to\r\n\r\nchange.\"   So, over dinner, I asked, \"Why did you say  that?\"\r\n\r\nHe  said,  \"You know, in Germany, we have had  so  many  good\r\n\r\nyears, it is very difficult to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake any change now in Germany.  You are different.  You  see\r\n\r\na problem, you analyse it, you make the adjustment.\"  So, our\r\n\r\nGST  increase,  in  order  to lower taxes,  is  something  of\r\n\r\nfundamental importance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years ago, when we were toying with the idea of a\r\n\r\nGST, I was the MOS to Dr Richard Hu.  He knew I was going  to\r\n\r\nHong Kong and calling on Finance Secretary Piers Jacobs.  So,\r\n\r\nhe  said, \"You ask Piers when Hong Kong is going to introduce\r\n\r\nthe  GST.\"   When I asked Piers, he said, \"After  Singapore\",\r\n\r\nwith  a  smile.  After we introduced the GST, I went back  to\r\n\r\nHong Kong and I called on him again.  I asked, \"When are  you\r\n\r\nstarting?\"   This  time, he shook his  head  and  said,  \"No.\r\n\r\nPolitically,  it is very difficult to do so.\"  I  know,  even\r\n\r\nthough he did not say it, that the British Government did not\r\n\r\nsee  why it should incur the political cost of introducing  a\r\n\r\nGST  when  it is a Hong Kong that is returned to China  which\r\n\r\nwill  benefit from it in the long term.  So, today,  when  we\r\n\r\nanalyse  Hong Kong's long-term fiscal position,  it  is  much\r\n\r\nless  comfortable than ours, precisely because  they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave a GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Mr Leong, Mr Singh, Mr Wee and Dr Chong\r\n\r\nthat we track very closely Singapore's relative cost position\r\n\r\nin  the  world.   The  entire tax restructuring  exercise  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  intended to lower cost for companies.  And  we  do\r\n\r\nwatch  carefully the level of Government fees and  levies  to\r\n\r\nensure  that we stay competitive.  This is how we  have  been\r\n\r\nable   to  attract  more  than  our  fair  share  of  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments.   But we cannot be complacent, because  relative\r\n\r\npositions change all the time.  There are many inter-ministry\r\n\r\ncommittees, and most include members from the private sector.\r\n\r\nThis is to answer Mr Wee Siew Kim's point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have briefed Members of this House before, we are\r\n\r\nvery much seized by the challenge of China.  Mr Leong, Mr Gan\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Wee spoke of the need for a comprehensive  response,\r\n\r\nand  this is precisely what we have been doing.  IE Singapore\r\n\r\nworks  with  Singapore business associations  and  individual\r\n\r\ncompanies and businessmen to pool information,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate  networks and facilitate the creation of  consortiums.\r\n\r\nNetwork  China,  launched by Deputy Prime  Minister  Lee  and\r\n\r\nChinese  leader Li Ruihuan earlier this year, was established\r\n\r\nfor this purpose.  We also work with our Chinese counterparts\r\n\r\nin a variety of ways.  For example, we have business councils\r\n\r\nwhich help Singapore companies operate in Shandong, Hubei and\r\n\r\nSichuan.   Our political relations with China are  excellent.\r\n\r\nMr  Gan  Kim Yong suggested that our GLCs team up with  other\r\n\r\nSingapore  companies in China.  In fact, this  is  often  the\r\n\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is a huge opportunity and its domestic market will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to grow for many years to come.  Since 1997,  China\r\n\r\nbecame  the  Number One investment destination  for  overseas\r\n\r\nSingapore FDI, overtaking, for the first time, Malaysia.  But\r\n\r\nChina  is  not  an  easy place to do business,  and  not  all\r\n\r\ninvestments  there  have done well.   There  is,  really,  no\r\n\r\nsubstitute  for  deep knowledge.  At the end  of  last  year,\r\n\r\nChinese Vice Minister Long Yongtu came to Singapore to give a\r\n\r\nspeech  and,  at the end of it, one question from  the  floor\r\n\r\nasked  for  his advice on doing business in China. He  smiled\r\n\r\nand  said,  \"Do not take at face value what you are  told  by\r\n\r\nprovincial governors, party secretaries and city mayors.  You\r\n\r\nshould check for yourself and make sure you have a good local\r\n\r\npartner.\"  Conditions vary from province to province and from\r\n\r\ncounty to county, and we must know the ground in which we are\r\n\r\nhoping to plant for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To build up a pool of younger Singaporeans who know\r\n\r\nChina  and other Asian countries well, MTI launched the Asian\r\n\r\nBusiness Fellowship last October.  Some study for their  MBAs\r\n\r\nin  universities like Tsinghua; others are being attached  to\r\n\r\nSingaporean, Chinese and international companies operating in\r\n\r\nChina for maybe one to two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next five years, we do not expect China to be a\r\n\r\nmajor competitive challenge to Singapore, because our economy\r\n\r\nis  at  a much higher level.  But, beyond that, we will  face\r\n\r\nthe pressure.  Every year,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChina  produces some 400,000 engineers.  It already has  more\r\n\r\nmobile handphones than the US.  China is overtaking Japan  as\r\n\r\nthe  world's  second biggest market for PCs.   Still  only  a\r\n\r\nthird  of the US, but growing very rapidly.  Within 10 years,\r\n\r\nprobably  less, China will have more Internet users than  the\r\n\r\nwhole   of   the  United  States.   Recently,  the  Economist\r\n\r\npredicted, when it was analysing the Chinese space programme,\r\n\r\nthat  the  next man to land on the moon would be from  China.\r\n\r\nSo,  all  our  moves are in anticipation of a very  different\r\n\r\nAsia and a very different China in the next 10 to 20 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But China is already a big challenge and a big headache\r\n\r\nfor  countries  like Malaysia.  Recently, I  led  a  business\r\n\r\ndelegation  to Malaysia, and some MPs accompanied  me.   Both\r\n\r\nMinister  Rafidah  and  I agreed that  at  the  coming  ASEAN\r\n\r\nEconomic Ministers Meeting in July, we will concentrate on  a\r\n\r\ncommon  strategy  to  extract the maximum  benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nproposed  China-ASEAN FTA.  Before I went  to  Penang,  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister Koh Tsu Koon called me up to apologise that he could\r\n\r\nnot  be  there  personally  to  welcome  me  because  he  was\r\n\r\naccompanying  Prime Minister Mahathir on his  overseas  trip.\r\n\r\nThen  he said, \"Can you please talk about China and our being\r\n\r\nhollowed out by China?\"  When I was in Penang, I met a  group\r\n\r\nof Singaporean businessmen over tea and they told me that the\r\n\r\nproblem  there  is quite serious.  In the last  three  years,\r\n\r\nPenang  received  very little manufacturing  investments  and\r\n\r\nmany factories have been relocated to China.  Before that,  I\r\n\r\nwas in Perak.  The Chief Minister hosted me to dinner and  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"This morning, I just told Malay businessmen in Perak,\r\n\r\nbetter  learn Chinese.\"  So, I asked, \"Isn't that politically\r\n\r\nsensitive?\"  He said, \"No, not at all.  We have got  to  face\r\n\r\nup to the challenge of China.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, when I was in JB for a conference on bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations, Chief Minister Abdul Ghani told me that he noticed\r\n\r\nmany   furniture  factories  in  Johore  closing  down,   and\r\n\r\nTaiwanese businessmen were all rushing to relocate in China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our neighbours are hollowed out, we in Singapore will\r\n\r\nlose out too, because we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed  complementary  industries based  on  cheaper  land  and\r\n\r\ncheaper  labour to sustain the higher value-added  activities\r\n\r\nthat we have here in Singapore.  It is, therefore, completely\r\n\r\nin  our  interest to help the region integrate and  become  a\r\n\r\ngood  alternative manufacturing base to China  for  American,\r\n\r\nJapanese and European investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, assure Mr Leong, Miss Low and Mr Wee that\r\n\r\nall our FTAs are negotiated with ASEAN in mind.  And, because\r\n\r\nwe  are more open and without an agricultural sector, we  can\r\n\r\ntake  the lead, it being much easier for us to negotiate FTAs\r\n\r\nwith  countries like Japan, the US, Europe and others.  Under\r\n\r\nthe US-Singapore FTA, for example, both sides have agreed  to\r\n\r\nan  Integrated Sourcing Initiative which will benefit, in the\r\n\r\nfirst phase, Bintan and Batam for a category of ICT products.\r\n\r\nUS  Trade Representative Robert Zoellick and I visited  those\r\n\r\nislands  with  our Indonesian counterpart, Ibu Rini  Soewandi\r\n\r\njust  last month.  Ibu Rini has just written to me to express\r\n\r\nher  deep appreciation for our efforts.  And, as Dr John Chen\r\n\r\nsuggested, our SMEs which manufacture ICT components in Batam\r\n\r\nor  Bintan,  or  sourced from there,  can  benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nInitiative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the final stages of our FTA negotiations with\r\n\r\nthe  US.  This morning's Straits Times reported that  the  US\r\n\r\nSenate  has  just  passed an amendment which  makes  it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  the  Bush Administration  to  get  the  Trade\r\n\r\nPromotion  Authority (TPA) which it is seeking in the  coming\r\n\r\ndays.   TPA  will  facilitate  the  passage  of  our  FTA  in\r\n\r\nCongress, but it is not absolutely essential.  The big  issue\r\n\r\nin  the Senate, this time round, is anti-dumping, which  does\r\n\r\nnot really involve us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, we completed our FTA with Japan, and\r\n\r\nboth  Houses  of the Japanese Diet have recently  passed  the\r\n\r\nrequired legislation, and the FTA will come into effect later\r\n\r\nthis  year.   We have also concluded negotiations with  EFTA,\r\n\r\nthe   European   Free  Trade  Area  consisting   of   Norway,\r\n\r\nSwitzerland,  Iceland  and Liechtenstein.   Our  negotiations\r\n\r\nwith Mexico, Canada and Australia are on-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngoing,  and  we  are, presently, lobbying support  among  the\r\n\r\nmember  countries of the EU for the launch of an EU-Singapore\r\n\r\nFTA  which  is  positively regarded by EU Trade  Commissioner\r\n\r\nPascal Lamy.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these FTAs give businesses here better access to\r\n\r\nvarious   markets  and  strengthen  Singapore  as  a  premier\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and services hub in Asia. They also help us  to\r\n\r\nhelp  our  neighbours.   I  know that  there  has  been  some\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding about how FTAs work, but I am glad that  our\r\n\r\nneighbours  are  now much clearer how they can  benefit  from\r\n\r\nthem.  You  would have read in the newspapers about  Thailand\r\n\r\nand the Philippines also being interested in having bilateral\r\n\r\nFTAs with Japan and the US.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN's greatest advantage is that, unlike China, we do\r\n\r\nnot pose a strategic challenge to the big powers. We threaten\r\n\r\nnobody  and  therefore,  we can be  friends  with  everybody.\r\n\r\nChina, too, wants ASEAN as a friend.  When Vice President  Hu\r\n\r\nJintao  was in Singapore recently, he said that China felt  a\r\n\r\ndeep  responsibility for ASEAN.  China's offer of an FTA with\r\n\r\nASEAN, which will make us the world's biggest FTA of close to\r\n\r\ntwo  billion  people in 10 years, is of very great  political\r\n\r\nsignificance.   ASEAN's best response is  to  accept  China's\r\n\r\noffer  but,  at the same time, make sure that we  have  close\r\n\r\neconomic  links  with  the  US,  Japan,  Europe,  India   and\r\n\r\nAustralia.   Then, we minimise our dependence,  we  diversify\r\n\r\nour markets and we maximise our own space.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong, Dr Chen, Dr Chong, Mr Wee and others have\r\n\r\nexpressed  their concern about competition from Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nthis  seems to be a recurring theme during the last few days.\r\n\r\nMany  Singaporeans naturally worry about the loss  of  Maersk\r\n\r\nand  Evergreen  to Tanjong Pelapas.  Malaysian  leaders  have\r\n\r\nalso announced quite openly their intention to take away from\r\n\r\nus  logistics,  petrochemical and other  businesses.   Johore\r\n\r\nChief  Minister, Abdul Ghani was reported to have  said  that\r\n\r\nJohore's cooperative relationship with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  ended  and the new  relationship  is  one  of\r\n\r\ncompetition.    I  think  he  must  have  been   misreported.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is our second most important investment destination\r\n\r\nand  half of our investments go to Johore.  More than 60%  of\r\n\r\nforeign  tourists  who visit Malaysia go  through  Singapore,\r\n\r\nvery  many  of  them Singaporeans.  If the dominant  economic\r\n\r\nrelationship   between   Johore  is   not   cooperative   but\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  the consequences for both sides would  be  very\r\n\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in some areas, we will compete like in the\r\n\r\nport business.  We were not pleased that Maersk and Evergreen\r\n\r\nhad been lost but no one believes that PSA is taking all this\r\n\r\nlying  down.   We did not become one of the world's  greatest\r\n\r\nports  by  being unresponsive to changing market  conditions.\r\n\r\nDitto   for   Changi   Airport.    In   the   logistics   and\r\n\r\ntransportation business, we intend to keep the position  that\r\n\r\nwe  have had since Sir Stamford Raffles established Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  trading post for the East India Company, and  we  have\r\n\r\ndeep  strengths.  The key is the efficiency and  fairness  of\r\n\r\nour  public  administration  -  no  corruption  or  cronyism,\r\n\r\ncomplete  rationality in the systems we operate,  competitive\r\n\r\npricing  and keeping our doors open to the best operators  in\r\n\r\nthe  world.  For  petrochemicals, yes, other hydrocarbon-rich\r\n\r\ncountries  have cheaper feedstocks but we are very  efficient\r\n\r\nand  we  intend to stay that way.  If we have not  been  more\r\n\r\nefficient,  we  could never have kept the  refinery  business\r\n\r\nwhen our neighbours built their own refineries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most economic sectors, our relationship with\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is a complementary one, with electronics  the  most\r\n\r\nobvious  example.  In fact, to be very frank, our worry  here\r\n\r\nis  that  Malaysia is not producing enough technical manpower\r\n\r\nfor  the  industry. Take wafer fab as an example. In Shanghai\r\n\r\nat  Jia Ding, they are building a wafer fab park that will be\r\n\r\ndrawing  in billions of dollars of investment. We  are  still\r\n\r\nsome years ahead of China.  We are going into 12\" wafer fabs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhile  China  is still trying to get equipment for  8\"  wafer\r\n\r\nfabs.   They will compete against Malaysia's two 8\"  fabs  in\r\n\r\nSarawak and Kedah.  If Malaysia does not keep up with  China,\r\n\r\nthey will be affected and we will be disadvantaged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Rafidah understands the importance of the\r\n\r\nbilateral  economic  relationship. She wants  more  Singapore\r\n\r\nbusinessmen to invest in Malaysia.  She told me that  she  is\r\n\r\ncoming  down  in  early August as a guest of SCI  to  promote\r\n\r\nMalaysia  to  Singapore investors.   When  I  told  her  that\r\n\r\ndespite  occasional bilateral problems, we were like  Siamese\r\n\r\ntwins, she agreed heartily and referred to Eng and Chang.   I\r\n\r\nthought it was Chang and Eng.  I suppose Malaysia must be Eng\r\n\r\nand  we  must  be  Chang.  She told members  of  my  business\r\n\r\ndelegation  in  KL  recently to ignore reports  of  bilateral\r\n\r\nproblems  and  that the economic relationship will  continue.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, we need each other.  Bilateral trade between  us\r\n\r\nmakes  up  half of total intra-ASEAN trade.  Without Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  Singapore, there is very little left in  AFTA.   We  are\r\n\r\nmajor  investors  in each other's economy.  Thus,  the  major\r\n\r\nchallenge  for Singapore is not Malaysia, but China  and  our\r\n\r\nresponse  to  China requires us to strengthen  our  links  in\r\n\r\nASEAN, especially our links to Malaysia and Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong and Mr Wee asked about our relations with\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  With devolution of power to the provinces and  to\r\n\r\nthe  regencies, the local authorities near Singapore are very\r\n\r\nkeen  to work directly with us.  We are prepared to work with\r\n\r\nthem to help them build up their administrative capabilities.\r\n\r\nBut  we are very mindful that everything we do must have  the\r\n\r\nblessings of Jakarta.  The Indonesian economy will take  some\r\n\r\nyears to recover from the disruptions of the last four years.\r\n\r\nWe  can  play a modest role in helping Indonesia to  recover.\r\n\r\nOnce  there  is political stability, Indonesia  can  be  very\r\n\r\ncompetitive  because of the favourable exchange  rate.   Many\r\n\r\nMNCs  have  told us that if the environment for manufacturing\r\n\r\nin   Indonesia  improves,  Indonesia  and  Singapore,  as   a\r\n\r\ncombination, can be more than a match for China on many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanufacturing activities.  Unfortunately, it is not so simple\r\n\r\nbut  Minister Rini and I have been working very hard  in  the\r\n\r\nlast few months to break new ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee asked how we can benefit from our position in\r\n\r\nbetween India and China.  Indeed, India is an important  part\r\n\r\nof  our  strategy to place Singapore as a hub  for  a  region\r\n\r\nmarked out by a seven-hour flying radius around us.  We  have\r\n\r\ngood  political  and  economic links with  India.   Recently,\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  Vajpayee proposed to Prime  Minister  Goh  a\r\n\r\nComprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement between the  two\r\n\r\ncountries. The Joint Study Group has already been formed  and\r\n\r\nexpects  to  complete its recommendations at the end  of  one\r\n\r\nyear.  Like China, India is a huge country and conditions can\r\n\r\nvary  quite  a  lot  from state to state.   In  sectors  like\r\n\r\nlogistics,  IT  and telcommunciations, there are  interesting\r\n\r\nopportunities.  Since PM Narasimha Rao's policy of opening up\r\n\r\nIndia more than 10 years ago, Singapore has positioned itself\r\n\r\nas  India's  long-term strategic partner, as a Hong  Kong  to\r\n\r\nIndia.   With  India's  bilateral trade  with  China  growing\r\n\r\nrapidly, there are many opportunities for our businessmen  to\r\n\r\nwork with both sides.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh worries about the competitiveness of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  in  Singapore.  I am glad to  report  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse that we have not done badly at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year, after September 11, when the picture\r\n\r\nlooked rather bleak, AMD and UMC announced their intention to\r\n\r\nbuild  jointly  a 12\" wafer fab in Singapore based  on  0.065\r\n\r\nmicron  technology.   Such  technology  does  not  yet  exist\r\n\r\nanywhere  in  the  world today.  But the  two  companies  are\r\n\r\nconfident  that,  with  the commitment  we  give  to  R&D  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, that technology will be available by the time  the\r\n\r\nplant is open for operation in 2005.  This is a multi-billion\r\n\r\ndollar investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The protection of intellectual property, a point made by\r\n\r\nMr  Wee  Siew  Kim,  is very important for such  investments.\r\n\r\nThis  is  one  major advantage we enjoy over  countries  like\r\n\r\nChina.  Two months ago, I opened\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo new facilities built by the pharmaceutical giant Wyeth in\r\n\r\nTuas,  costing $550 million.  As I took leave,  the  Chairman\r\n\r\npulled  me  aside and said, \"Your protection of  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty  is crucial to our decision to build those  plants.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  this  is  why we are doing a lot to build up  an  entire\r\n\r\nregime  for  the  protection  of  intellectual  property   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another good example is the Toshiba-Matsushita Joint\r\n\r\nVenture to build Thin Film Transistor Liquid Crystal Displays\r\n\r\n(TFT-LCD) for television and other electronic products.  This\r\n\r\nis  state-of-the-art technology.  The panels will be used  in\r\n\r\nall kinds of electronic products and will replace the cathode\r\n\r\nray tube in television sets and computer displays.  The plant\r\n\r\nin  Pasir Ris, which should be one of the largest LCD  plants\r\n\r\nin the world, will start operation in the second half of this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Philips decided to set up its global\r\n\r\ndevelopment  centre  also  for  LCD  TV  in  Singapore.   Its\r\n\r\nfacility  here  will cover a full range of  activities,  from\r\n\r\nproduct  creation  to  testing and  marketing.   The  CEO  of\r\n\r\nPhilips in Singapore, Johan van Splunter said, \"Singapore was\r\n\r\nchosen  for its conducive environment and ready talent  pool.\r\n\r\nThe   pro-business   infrastructure  and  strong   government\r\n\r\npartnerships  further  facilitate  the  growth  of   Philips'\r\n\r\nbusinesses  here.\"  Many of us would have  read  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  and  Business Times reporting that we  are  losing  12\r\n\r\nsenior executives to Hong Kong, but that is small compared to\r\n\r\nwhat  we  have  here.   Philips  has  a  staff  of  3,000  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  including 800 engineers at the Philips Innovation\r\n\r\nCampus and has every intention to build on what it has  here.\r\n\r\nThere are other examples in manufacturing which I do not have\r\n\r\ntime to go into today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the biomedical sciences, we are making good progress.\r\n\r\nLast  year,  the  pharmaceutical sector was  a  bright  spot,\r\n\r\ngrowing at over 10% despite the recession.  We have announced\r\n\r\ntwo   one-billion  dollar  funds,  one  to  promote   private\r\n\r\nbiomedical  R&D in Singapore, the other to invest in  cluster\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   Yesterday, Mr Leong  Horn  Kee  asked  why  Mr\r\n\r\nPhilip Yeo was reluctant to provide more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  reason  is  obvious.  There is no need to  provide  such\r\n\r\ninformation to our potential competitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the Biopolis is proceeding on schedule. Last\r\n\r\nyear, both Eli Lilly and Novartis have announced plans to set\r\n\r\nup  important  research facilities in Singapore.   You  would\r\n\r\nhave  read  in  the newspapers that the Genome  Institute  of\r\n\r\nSingapore was opened recently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr Alan Colman, the scientist who cloned Dolly the\r\n\r\nsheep, decided to relocate to Singapore to work for ESI which\r\n\r\nis  a  company  producing stem cells, it caused  considerable\r\n\r\ndiscomfort  in  England because we are all  in  the  game  of\r\n\r\nattracting  talent.   This  is an interesting  company,  ESI,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been formed to exploit the commercial benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe  stem  cell  lines  which  Dr  Arif  Bongso  of  NUS  has\r\n\r\ndeveloped.  You will remember that last year, President  Bush\r\n\r\napproved  for federal funding, work on 60 existing stem  cell\r\n\r\nlines  in  the  world.  We have six of them which  Dr  Bongso\r\n\r\ndeveloped  in collaboration with scientists in Australia  and\r\n\r\nIsrael.   Dr  Bongso himself, a Sri Lankan, was recruited  by\r\n\r\nthe  late Prof. S Ratnam many years ago.  All these have  put\r\n\r\nus  in  the scientific literature and on the world biomedical\r\n\r\nmap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, a team of 10 scientists specialising in\r\n\r\ncancer  research from Kyoto University, headed  by  Professor\r\n\r\nYoshiaki Ito, has relocated to IMCB because of our commitment\r\n\r\nto  the  development  of biomedical sciences  and  our  ready\r\n\r\nacceptance  of foreign talent in our midst.  They  know  they\r\n\r\nare welcome here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cite these few examples to make the point that our\r\n\r\nwillingness to make adjustments in order to stay ahead of the\r\n\r\ncompetition, that is in itself a major competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nOur  reputation precedes us.  Companies know that  when  they\r\n\r\nhave  problems  in Singapore, we will help them  solve  those\r\n\r\nproblems.  Remaking Singapore is not easy, especially when we\r\n\r\nare not doing badly.  But it must be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone.  And others are watching us, watching what we do.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon, during the Budget Debate and Mr Leong\r\n\r\nHorn Kee yesterday, asked why we have to rename NSTB, TDB and\r\n\r\nPSB  to  A*STAR,  IE  Singapore and SPRING.   The  reason  is\r\n\r\nbecause  we have reorganized these statutory boards  and  set\r\n\r\nthem new missions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSTB has transferred $2 billion out of its 5-year $7\r\n\r\nbillion  budget  to  EDB,  the  portion  which  is  used   to\r\n\r\nincentivise  private  R&D  activities,  which  we  call  RISC\r\n\r\nfunding.   NSTB  has  reorganised  the  Research  Institutes,\r\n\r\nconsolidating 13 existing ones to nine, and establishing four\r\n\r\nnew ones.  There will be further consolidation in the future.\r\n\r\nOur   objective   is   to  build  strong  multi-disciplinary,\r\n\r\napplications-oriented research entities  for  industry.   Our\r\n\r\nemphasis  is not on research for research sake, but  research\r\n\r\nto help build up long term economic capabilities here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Penang, they do not have what we have.\r\n\r\nAnd  so  they  recognised they are in a  difficult  position.\r\n\r\nMuch  more  emphasis  is  now placed on  the  development  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean  scientific manpower for which $500  million  has\r\n\r\nbeen  set aside.  The key to success will be the quality  and\r\n\r\nquantity  of  top  talent that we are able to  root  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   If we can do it we will thrive.  If  we  cannot,\r\n\r\nthen  we  will  move  down the league table,  that  is  that.\r\n\r\nBecause of the redefinition of NSTB's function, we decided to\r\n\r\nadd  \"Research\"  into its name and rename  it  an  Agency  to\r\n\r\nsignal its greater closeness to industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old TDB was principally concerned with trade\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  With the growth of our external wing,  we  need\r\n\r\nto  support  not  only our traders but also increasingly  our\r\n\r\noverseas investors.  Mrs Lim Hwee Hua correctly spoke of  the\r\n\r\nneed to distinguish between GNP and GDP.  This is because our\r\n\r\noverseas  portfolio,  both direct and indirect,  will  become\r\n\r\nmore and more important in the future.  Because we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  a  high  savings  rate and receive  substantial  inward\r\n\r\ninvestments, we have become a major capital exporter to other\r\n\r\ncountries.   We have become a significant investor  in  every\r\n\r\nASEAN  country  and  beyond,  in  China,  Hong  Kong,  India,\r\n\r\nAustralia  and  other  countries.   Where  we  can  help  our\r\n\r\ninvestors  overseas,  we should.  Our concern  is  no  longer\r\n\r\ntrade alone, although trade remains very important and has  a\r\n\r\nsub-group working on it under the ERC.  For this reason,  TDB\r\n\r\nhas  been reorganised to help Singapore companies regionalise\r\n\r\nand   globalise,  and  hence  the  change  of  the  name   to\r\n\r\nInternational   Enterprise  Singapore.   IE  Singapore   will\r\n\r\nsupport  the Singapore Business Federation if it  decides  on\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of  industry associations which Mr Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nproposed yesterday.  I apologise to Mrs Lim Hwee Hua for  not\r\n\r\nproviding  the GNP data she asked for in the  past.   I  will\r\n\r\nchase  the  Statistics Department, but it  is  not  a  simple\r\n\r\nmatter, collecting this new information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSB has handed over its international functions to IE\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  will  no longer organise overseas  missions.\r\n\r\nBut  it will remain the principal economic agency to help our\r\n\r\n100,000  SMEs,  only  a  few  of which  can  think  of  going\r\n\r\noverseas.    For   many   years,  PSB  has   been   promoting\r\n\r\nproductivity  and standardisation with considerable  success.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this is no longer enough in a fast-changing  world.\r\n\r\nInnovation has become very important for the improvement of a\r\n\r\ncountry's  Total Factor Productivity.  Productivity  improves\r\n\r\nwhat  is  inside  the box.  Standardisation  turns  boxes  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  shapes  and  sizes into  standardised  containers.\r\n\r\nInnovation  encourages us to look outside the box.   This  is\r\n\r\ntherefore a major addition to PSB's mission.  The name SPRING\r\n\r\nincludes  Innovation after Standardisation and  Productivity,\r\n\r\nall  of which are meant to enhance Singapore's total economic\r\n\r\nperformance, which in the end translates into higher  profits\r\n\r\nand  wages.   I  was  delighted to hear  Mr  Zainul  Abidin's\r\n\r\ncompliments about the name SPRING yesterday.  The  new  names\r\n\r\nhave been chosen precisely to signal change and to express  a\r\n\r\ncertain  freshness.  But I fully understand why  some  people\r\n\r\nmay not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntake  to  them.  We could have continued using the old  names\r\n\r\nand  carried  on.   But  putting new wine  into  old  bottles\r\n\r\ndevalues the new wine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One place we must remake is Sentosa. This was raised by\r\n\r\nMr  Leong  Horn  Kee  yesterday.  It has  been  a  symbol  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's success for many years and well-known  throughout\r\n\r\nthe  world.   But in recent years we were not  able  to  make\r\n\r\nfresh  breakthroughs.   Facilities like  Fantasy  Island  and\r\n\r\nAsian  Village, have failed.  The land has since  been  taken\r\n\r\nback  by  Sentosa.  When Mr Alan Choe retired, I  invited  Mr\r\n\r\nPhilip  Ng to take over as the new Chairman.  He was a little\r\n\r\nreluctant  at  first  because  his  company,  Far  East,  was\r\n\r\nthinking  of  making  bids for land in Sentosa  Cove.   So  I\r\n\r\nassured  him that we could ring-fence the Cove from  him  and\r\n\r\nhis company can continue to tender for the land when it is up\r\n\r\nfor  tender.  Then after that, the CEO, a civil servant,  was\r\n\r\nretiring.   Mr  Philip Ng looked around for a Singaporean  to\r\n\r\ntake  over,  because so many MPs have raised questions  about\r\n\r\nSentosa, he wanted to show sensitivity.  So I had lunch  with\r\n\r\nhim  and  I  told him, \"Philip, my job is to  defend  you  in\r\n\r\nParliament.  You choose the best man for the job.  Please  do\r\n\r\na  global  search.\"   So he has selected Darrel  Metzger,  an\r\n\r\nAmerican who had worked before in Tokyo's Disneyland, in Hong\r\n\r\nKong's Ocean Park and in Hawaii's Atlantis Adventure.  In the\r\n\r\ncoming  months,  Sentosa will be making major  announcements,\r\n\r\nincluding  a major reduction in entrance fees to the  island.\r\n\r\nNow,  I  do  not wish to steal Mr Philip Ng's  or  Mr  Darell\r\n\r\nMetzger's  thunder.   Also we should give  the  Chairman  and\r\n\r\nMembers of the Board maximum flexibility to do their work and\r\n\r\nnot  make  them  feel  that every project  is  somehow  under\r\n\r\nparliamentary oversight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh asked whether and when we are going to\r\n\r\nintroduce a Competition Law.  This is not a simple  piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation   because  such  a  law,  instead  of   promoting\r\n\r\ncompetition,  may  raise cost and act  to  the  detriment  of\r\n\r\nconsumers.  This note of caution was raised very thoughtfully\r\n\r\nby Mrs Lim Hwee Hua yesterday when she asked: are we sure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  competition is better in every case?  We  have  studied\r\n\r\ncarefully  the experiences of other countries and  circulated\r\n\r\nvarious  draft  legislation for comment in  the  private  and\r\n\r\npublic sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have more or less settled on a few key ideas. In\r\n\r\ngeneral,  the  law  will prohibit anti-competitive  behaviour\r\n\r\nsuch  as  price fixing and abuse of dominance.  Dominance  by\r\n\r\nitself  will not be disallowed.  But abuse of dominance  will\r\n\r\nbe actionable.  A Competition Commission will be set up as  a\r\n\r\nhorizontal  agency  covering  all  industry  sectors.    Some\r\n\r\nactivities may have to be carved out in the public  interest.\r\n\r\nWhere  there  is conflict between the Competition  Commission\r\n\r\nand domain regulators, like IDA, a defined process would have\r\n\r\nto  be  followed.  We will bear in mind Mrs  Lim  Hwee  Hua's\r\n\r\npoint   that  we  must  not  make  mergers  and  acquisitions\r\n\r\nunnecessarily  difficult.  Our aim is  to  have  such  a  law\r\n\r\nwithin  two  to  three  years,  but  because  of  its  sweep,\r\n\r\nextensive consultations with industry will have to be carried\r\n\r\nout.   As  a  matter  of  principle, we will  allow  parallel\r\n\r\nimports  to prevent price discrimination against Singaporeans\r\n\r\nby  big  suppliers, which was a point raised by  Mr  Tan  Soo\r\n\r\nKhoon  yesterday in connection with \"white pumps\" and  by  Mr\r\n\r\nOng Kian Min in connection with distribution channels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, at the Committee of Supply, I announced the\r\n\r\nformation of a CASE-MTI Task Force to look into the enactment\r\n\r\nof  a Consumer Protection Law.  The Task Force has since  put\r\n\r\nup  its report and I am pleased to inform Mr Yeo, Dr Teo  and\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin  Tet  Yung  that we will table  a  Bill  for  the\r\n\r\nenactment of such a law this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Task Force proposed a simple piece of legislation\r\n\r\nwhich  will  help  consumers seek  civil  remedies.   As  the\r\n\r\namounts  are small, most of these cases can go to  the  Small\r\n\r\nClaims  Tribunal.   Where  there are reasonable  grounds  for\r\n\r\ncomplaint,  CASE will assist them.  The law will provide  for\r\n\r\ncivil  but not criminal remedies because there already  exist\r\n\r\nlaws for criminal cases like the Consumer Protection Act, the\r\n\r\nPenal   Code,   the  Miscellaneous  Offences  Act   and   the\r\n\r\nCommodities Futures Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, his predecessor\r\n\r\nDr  Teo Ho Pin, and their colleagues in CASE for helping  MTI\r\n\r\ncome to such a position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin proposed the establishment of a statutory\r\n\r\nboard  specifically to protect consumers.  We might  do  that\r\n\r\none day, but for the time being, I think let us regulate with\r\n\r\na  light  touch rather than with a heavy hand.  Whatever  the\r\n\r\nlaws  in place, buyers should always beware.  If a deal looks\r\n\r\ntoo good to be true, it probably is not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Mr Yeo that MTI will continue to support\r\n\r\nCASE in its efforts to educate and protect consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Tan Soo Khoon, having read Business Times'\r\n\r\nreport  of  a recent representation to MTI by the  major  oil\r\n\r\ncompanies, asked whether the Government was going ahead  with\r\n\r\n\"white  pumps\".  Let me confirm that we have every  intention\r\n\r\nto.   We  have earlier identified some sites to try  out  the\r\n\r\nconcept, but they were dropped due to security considerations\r\n\r\nafter  September 11, except for a new site in Punggol.   This\r\n\r\nis  a  site  in  HDB's  reserve list of  sale  sites  for  an\r\n\r\nintegrated development of residential, commercial and  petrol\r\n\r\npumping facilities.  The oil majors have raised valid  points\r\n\r\nabout  the importance of a level playing field so that petrol\r\n\r\nstations  will not compete at a disadvantage.  We will  study\r\n\r\nthem  and  take them into account.  For the Punggol site,  we\r\n\r\nwill open it to public tender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the mini-marts operated by petrol stations, which\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  Soo Khoon is opposed to, they are a convenience  for\r\n\r\nall  of us and I think they should not be disallowed.  In any\r\n\r\ncase,  since  we  are allowing supermarkets to  go  into  the\r\n\r\npetrol pump business, we should not prevent petrol pumps from\r\n\r\ngoing into the mini-mart business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Sir, many Members have expressed\r\n\r\nconcerns  about  the problems and challenges  that  our  SMEs\r\n\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government places great importance on\r\n\r\ndeveloping   a   vibrant  SME  sector.   It  recognizes   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  faced  by  small firms  in  getting  access  to\r\n\r\nfinancing,  or in investing in technologies and  capabilities\r\n\r\nbefore they have acquired economies of scale.  I will address\r\n\r\nMembers'  queries  on how Government is assisting  the  SMEs.\r\n\r\nBut first let me elaborate on the issue of business costs  as\r\n\r\nwas  raised by several Members, including Mr Inderjit  Singh,\r\n\r\nMr Ong Kian Min, Miss Penny Low, Mr Arthur Fong, Dr John Chen\r\n\r\nand  Mrs  Lim  Hwee  Hua.   As the  Minister  has  said,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment takes very seriously the issue of cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three main components in business cost: land,\r\n\r\nwages,  and  what  Mr Inderjit Singh referred  to  as  hidden\r\n\r\ncosts,  or charges and levies imposed by Government, such  as\r\n\r\nutility  fees.   Land costs are of concern to  the  Ministry,\r\n\r\nparticularly  industrial land.  We  agree  with  Mr  Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh that land has to be priced to ensure that manufacturing\r\n\r\nremains  viable  in Singapore.  Land is zoned for  industrial\r\n\r\nuse  in Singapore for this reason.  The State has provided  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial amount of industrial land which will  secure  the\r\n\r\nlong term requirements of our manufacturing sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land is scarce in Singapore and we cannot match land\r\n\r\nprices  in  much  larger countries or those with  much  lower\r\n\r\nstandards  of  living.  Our approach in  industrial  land  is\r\n\r\ntherefore not to match the lowest prices internationally, but\r\n\r\nto  make the most competitive use of the little land we have.\r\n\r\nHence,  we ask industrialists to make more intensive  use  of\r\n\r\ntheir  land  and cluster together to share common facilities.\r\n\r\nJTC  now  builds factories, which used to be  on  the  ground\r\n\r\nlevel, on multiple storeys with vehicular access.  These  are\r\n\r\npopular   with   companies.    Our  petrochemical   companies\r\n\r\noccupying  huge tracts of reclaimed land are also competitive\r\n\r\nbecause of the advantage of large scale integration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, current land prices in Singapore are competitive.\r\n\r\nJTC's  posted  industrial land rentals in urban and  suburban\r\n\r\nareas have declined by about 40% since the peak in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1996, while those in outlying areas have fallen by about 19%.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  prime CBD office occupation costs are  now  much\r\n\r\nlower than in Hong Kong, Taipei, and even Beijing.  They also\r\n\r\nremain  lower,  of course, than Tokyo, London and  New  York.\r\n\r\nNot   every   business  will  find  Singapore's  land   costs\r\n\r\ncompetitive with other locations for the particular  activity\r\n\r\nthey  are  engaged in.  But at current prices, we  are  fully\r\n\r\nable  to  attract  a range of industries that  add  value  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the current economic conditions, the Government\r\n\r\nhas reduced rentals so as to help companies, especially SMEs,\r\n\r\ncushion  the downturn in their revenues and cash  flow.   The\r\n\r\nJTC rental rebates are due to expire in June.  The Government\r\n\r\nhas decided to extend the rebates to the end of the year.   A\r\n\r\ntotal of 9,000 companies, including 5,000 SMEs, will continue\r\n\r\nto benefit from JTC rental rebates, which are currently about\r\n\r\n20% on average and, in some cases, up to 30%.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides giving direct rebates, JTC has liberalised\r\n\r\nseveral  of  its  policies  to  give  its  customers  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility in managing their costs.  I will cite several  of\r\n\r\nthese  measures because the specifics are important.  Members\r\n\r\nmay not be aware of them, and they do add up to a significant\r\n\r\nimprovement in business costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, JTC now allows firms to sublet up to 50% of their\r\n\r\nspace.   For  lessees,  as distinct from  tenants,  they  are\r\n\r\nallowed to sublet as much space as they want after the  first\r\n\r\nfive  years.  This liberal subletting policy allows the firms\r\n\r\nto  better  manage operating costs.  It also makes it  easier\r\n\r\nfor  small  firms to obtain space by subletting from  someone\r\n\r\nelse, instead of paying for an entire factory unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, companies affected by the downturn are now allowed\r\n\r\nto defer their committed investments for a year or more on  a\r\n\r\ncase-by-case  basis by the JTC, so that they  can  use  their\r\n\r\navailable  funds to meet immediate operational  requirements.\r\n\r\nIn addition, industrialists whose leases are expiring but who\r\n\r\nare unable to decide on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  investment  plans  due to business  uncertainties  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  defer the renewal decision for two  years  while\r\n\r\nremaining in their sites as tenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC also has a scheme to help small companies that are\r\n\r\nstarting  out new businesses or new product lines to overcome\r\n\r\ncash  flow difficulties during the initial years.   It  gives\r\n\r\nthem  rental discounts of 70% in the first year, reducing  to\r\n\r\n30%  in  the  third year.  This is the New Business  Creation\r\n\r\nIncentive  Scheme.  JTC is, in addition, designing  no-frills\r\n\r\nfacilities  to help SMEs who need fairly standard  functional\r\n\r\nspaces to minimise their costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under a further relaxation of JTC rules, exiting tenants\r\n\r\nno  longer  have to restore their premises to their  original\r\n\r\nuse  if  the incoming tenants are prepared to take  over  the\r\n\r\npremises  in their current state.  This saves cost  for  both\r\n\r\nthe exiting and incoming tenants.  JTC has also increased the\r\n\r\nsupply  of land with shorter tenures of 20 years or less,  in\r\n\r\nresponse to requests from SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the application process for JTC space has\r\n\r\nitself  been vastly simplified.  Application forms have  been\r\n\r\nshortened from 11 pages to 3.  SMEs no longer find themselves\r\n\r\nhaving  to  engage  consultants to produce in-depth  business\r\n\r\nplans as part of their applications.  All this reduces cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested that owners of factories\r\n\r\nshould  be  allowed to sell back their factories to  JTC  and\r\n\r\nthen lease the premises from JTC.  JTC is not keen to take on\r\n\r\nthis  role.   Buying  back  and  leasing  is  essentially   a\r\n\r\nfinancial  arrangement that the private  sector  is  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide  and,  indeed, has begun to provide in  a  number  of\r\n\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other major component of costs is wages. To\r\n\r\nstay  competitive,  wages cannot run ahead  of  productivity.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  objective of economic policy is not  to  force\r\n\r\nwages  down  but to raise productivity, so that  workers  can\r\n\r\nenjoy  higher standards of living.  We may have to cut  wages\r\n\r\nduring a bad economic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndownturn to save jobs, as the Government has done by reducing\r\n\r\nemployer's CPF contribution rates across the board.  But  the\r\n\r\nlonger-term  solution for competitiveness lies  in  upgrading\r\n\r\nskills  and  capabilities  in Singapore  so  as  to  increase\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we agree with Mr Inderjit Singh that other cost\r\n\r\ncomponents,   in  particular  Government  fees  and   utility\r\n\r\ncharges, should be kept as low as possible, so as not to load\r\n\r\nup  business  costs, except where there are  specific  policy\r\n\r\nobjectives,  such  as  energy  and  water  conservation.   Mr\r\n\r\nRaymond  Lim  will  be  elaborating  on  keeping  such  costs\r\n\r\ncompetitive, including the business of electricity tariffs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a wide array of assistance schemes to help\r\n\r\nSMEs.   Mr  Inderjit  Singh feels that  there  are  too  many\r\n\r\nschemes  administered  by too many Government  agencies,  and\r\n\r\nsuggested  that we should form a one-stop agency  overall  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  nurturing and growing local  companies.   As  the\r\n\r\nMinister has just mentioned, SPRING Singapore is the  primary\r\n\r\nagency  serving domestic SMEs.  It also provides SMEs with  a\r\n\r\none-stop  service to advise them on which assistance schemes,\r\n\r\nanywhere  in Government, are best suited to their needs,  and\r\n\r\nrefers  them  to  other  agencies  where  necessary.   SPRING\r\n\r\nSingapore  has advised several thousand SMEs in this  process\r\n\r\nof seeking out the best assistance in Government, given their\r\n\r\nneeds.   We still find cases where SMEs are sent from  pillar\r\n\r\nto  post  when  they  seek  Government  assistance,  but  the\r\n\r\ninstances  are  now  few.   The multi-agency  approach,  with\r\n\r\nSPRING  Singapore  serving  as a central  point  of  contact,\r\n\r\nallows for solutions to be customised to a very diverse range\r\n\r\nof  companies   -   some domestic, some going  international,\r\n\r\nsome  very  small, some past the mezzanine stage,  some  with\r\n\r\nfinancing needs and others with various specific capabilities\r\n\r\nthat need jacking up, and across a whole range of industries.\r\n\r\nHowever,   MTI   agrees  that  we  need  to  streamline   and\r\n\r\nrationalise our incentive and assistance schemes, and intends\r\n\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also felt that we are imposing MNC-type rules\r\n\r\nand criteria when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassessing  applications  by SMEs  for  grants  and  incentive\r\n\r\nschemes.   Sir, the schemes operated by EDB and IE  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  help  companies  grow do not give special  preference  to\r\n\r\nsmall  companies.  However, Members may be surprised to  know\r\n\r\nthat where EDB schemes are concerned, 50% of the total number\r\n\r\nof  projects  assisted last year were for local  enterprises,\r\n\r\nand  10%  were  for  local SMEs.  Under IE Singapore's  grant\r\n\r\nscheme to help companies develop overseas markets, 73% of the\r\n\r\nprojects  assisted  were for SMEs.  Further,  all  of  SPRING\r\n\r\nSingapore's assistance schemes are focused on SMEs.  There is\r\n\r\nno lack of support for SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also suggested that we categorise SMEs into\r\n\r\nthose with and without growth potential.  This is indeed what\r\n\r\nEDB  and IE Singapore have been seeking to do, so as to focus\r\n\r\nresources  and  assistance on companies with the  acumen  and\r\n\r\nwillingness  to upgrade, and which have had some  measure  of\r\n\r\nsuccess.   However,  the  definition of  what  constitutes  a\r\n\r\ngrowth   company  will have to remain soft,  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\npromising  companies are not denied support on the  basis  of\r\n\r\ninflexible  criteria.  If every company had to smell  like  a\r\n\r\nrose,  look like a rose and feel like a rose before it  stood\r\n\r\nthe  chance of being accepted as a rose, we would end up with\r\n\r\na very small rose garden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim has asked that Government be more pro-active in identifying global and regional champions.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Mr  Inderjit  Singh  felt  that  Government  should\r\n\r\noutsource the selection of promising local enterprises (PLEs)\r\n\r\nto  the  private  sector, as Government officials  cannot  be\r\n\r\nrelied  upon  to choose winners correctly.  The  Government's\r\n\r\napproach is to recognise winners that have been chosen by the\r\n\r\nmarket.   We  welcome feedback and nominations  of  PLEs  and\r\n\r\npotential regional champions from the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, access to financing. Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Ong\r\n\r\nKian  Min,  Mr  Arthur  Fong, Dr John Chen  and  others  have\r\n\r\npointed  out  the  difficulties that SMEs have  in  obtaining\r\n\r\nfinancing.   Their  concern  is  valid.   In  fact,  in  most\r\n\r\ncountries, start-ups and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMEs  at  an  early stage find it difficult  to  obtain  bank\r\n\r\nloans.   In  the  US, for instance, few start-ups  and  early\r\n\r\nstage ventures obtain their financing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members have pointed out, the tradition among\r\n\r\nSingapore-based  banks  has been to  lend  on  the  basis  of\r\n\r\nbalance  sheets  rather than cash flows.   This  has  led  to\r\n\r\nparticular   difficulties   during  the  economic   downturn,\r\n\r\nbecause  of falling asset values.  The Ministry is encouraged\r\n\r\nby  the interest of some banks to develop cash flow financing\r\n\r\nfacilities.  The banks will have to build up the expertise to\r\n\r\nmake  cash  flow projections and monitor companies' positions\r\n\r\non  an  ongoing basis.  But the SMEs themselves will have  to\r\n\r\nopen  up their books to the banks, much more than is the case\r\n\r\nfor  traditional  financing, and develop  better  methods  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  management.  SPRING Singapore  has  implemented  a\r\n\r\nFinancial Advisor grant scheme to help SMEs in doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen and Mr Arthur Fong were concerned that\r\n\r\npresent Government financing schemes for SMEs were also asset\r\n\r\nbased  and  do not provide working capital or business  cycle\r\n\r\nfinancing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has been paying special attention to\r\n\r\nworking  capital  financing, including cash  flow  financing.\r\n\r\nUnder  the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS), Government\r\n\r\nhas  made working capital loans to over 400 firms last  year,\r\n\r\ncompared to 35 a year earlier.  SPRING Singapore's new  Micro\r\n\r\nLoans Programme, which provides loans of up to $50,000,  very\r\n\r\nsmall  amounts but to very small companies, without requiring\r\n\r\nevidence of orders in hand, has been very popular.  More than\r\n\r\n<br><br>500&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micro loans have been granted since November last  year,\r\n\r\nwhen the scheme was first started.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has also increased its share of the\r\n\r\nloan  risk under LEFS, from 50% to 80%, in the two off-Budget\r\n\r\npackages  last year to encourage the participating  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  not  to cut back on lending  under  the  scheme\r\n\r\nduring  the economic downturn.  Similarly, Government funding\r\n\r\nfor certain schemes under the Local Enterprise Technical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssistance Scheme (LETAS) was raised from 50% to 70%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LEFS and LETAS enhancements are due to expire at the\r\n\r\nend of next month.  Government has decided to extend them  to\r\n\r\nthe  end of the year to help tide SMEs over while the economy\r\n\r\nis recovering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING Singapore is also exploring a Loan Insurance\r\n\r\nScheme for SMEs, whereby participating financial institutions\r\n\r\nbuy insurance on the market to cover part of the risk of loan\r\n\r\ndefault.   SPRING  Singapore will help defray  the  insurance\r\n\r\npremium  costs.  It hopes to introduce the scheme later  this\r\n\r\nyear, which should widen the financing options open to SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has also suggested that the LEFS\r\n\r\nscheme   be  expanded  to  allow  for  hybrid  financing   by\r\n\r\nparticipating financial institutions, for example, where  VCs\r\n\r\nand  investors  provide convertible loans  or  subscribe  for\r\n\r\npreferred shares.  We agree with Mr Singh that this is  worth\r\n\r\nlooking into.  However, we will need to adjust the terms  for\r\n\r\nLEFS,  including the question of whether it  would  still  be\r\n\r\nappropriate for Government to share 80% of the risk when  the\r\n\r\ninvestors are using equity-type instruments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen asked for the Government to take more\r\n\r\ndirect  stakes  in SMEs and start-ups.  This is  indeed  what\r\n\r\nEDB's  Start-Up Enterprises Development Scheme (SEEDS)  seeks\r\n\r\nto do.  SEEDS was set up in October last year.  So far, about\r\n\r\n40  applications have been approved, amounting to  an  equity\r\n\r\ninjection  of  $10  million  from  SEEDS,  with  a   matching\r\n\r\ninjection of $10 million from the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, capability development. Sir, the Government has\r\n\r\nsought  where  it  can to improve SMEs' access  to  financial\r\n\r\nmarkets.   That  is  the first prong.  The  second  prong  of\r\n\r\nGovernment assistance to SMEs is to help them build up  their\r\n\r\ncapabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cost environment will never match that of countries\r\n\r\nwith a lower standard of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliving  than us.  But SMEs can grow and succeed by developing\r\n\r\nthe  capacity  to innovate.  Many other high  cost  countries\r\n\r\nhave  a vibrant SME sector.  Denmark is one example.  It  has\r\n\r\nthriving  SMEs, and their level of productivity averages  86%\r\n\r\nof   that   of   large  enterprises.   In  Singapore,   SMEs'\r\n\r\nproductivity  is  about  60% of  the  national  average.   In\r\n\r\nGermany,  most of the companies in the precision  engineering\r\n\r\nindustry,  where  Germany is widely acknowledged  to  be  the\r\n\r\nworld  leader,  are  SMEs.   In the  state  of  Bavaria,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,   SMEs  account  for  over  half   of   the   total\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   sector's  employment   and   about   40%   of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing turnover.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua said that we should not neglect\r\n\r\nOld  Economy  firms.  We agree with her.   Innovation  is  as\r\n\r\nimportant in the Old Economy as in the New Economy,  and  the\r\n\r\nlabels   themselves  are  wearing  thin  as   knowledge-based\r\n\r\nenterprises spring up in what used to be thought  of  as  Old\r\n\r\nEconomy industries.  We have had several home grown successes\r\n\r\nin  some of these industries.  The food industry is   a  good\r\n\r\nexample.  Apart from well-known examples like Tee Yih Jia and\r\n\r\nothers  who  have  made  it  big internationally,  there  are\r\n\r\nseveral  other  local companies with great promise.   Let  me\r\n\r\nmention two companies which I visited earlier this year,  and\r\n\r\nwhose  founders I met.  They are examples of companies  which\r\n\r\nhave,  even  in  the  downturn,  continued  to  innovate  and\r\n\r\nexperiment  with  new products, processes and  concepts,  and\r\n\r\nhave succeeded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first example is Tac's Pte Ltd. Tac's turns\r\n\r\nindustrial  waste  in  the form of raw soybean  residue  into\r\n\r\nnutritional  bakery food products which are high  in  dietary\r\n\r\nfibre.   The  residue  is called OKARA.   It  is  a  Japanese\r\n\r\nconcept.   The  idea came from founder Bill  Lee's  encounter\r\n\r\nwith  a Japanese scientist who introduced him to the concept.\r\n\r\nFrom  a small family business running a traditional cafeteria\r\n\r\nat  the  Singapore General Hospital, Tac's now  has  a  7,000\r\n\r\nsquare  feet  factory  with its own R&D department,  creating\r\n\r\noriginal  soybean  based  bakery  products,  including  OKARA\r\n\r\nburgers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second example is BreadTalk, a boutique in what must\r\n\r\nbe one of the oldest food industries.  They have been able to\r\n\r\ndifferentiate  themselves  from other  bakeries  by  creating\r\n\r\noriginal pastries that appeal to Asian tastes, such as  their\r\n\r\nsignature pork floss bun.  George Quek, BreadTalk's  founder,\r\n\r\nstarted  his entrepreneurial career in Taiwan, where  from  a\r\n\r\nvery  humble start, he built up a successful food stall.   He\r\n\r\nreturned in the early 90s and started his first food court at\r\n\r\nJunction 8, where he introduced the concept of profit sharing\r\n\r\nwith  his  stall operators, and brought in foreign fare  like\r\n\r\nThai  and Japanese food in addition to the regular food court\r\n\r\nstaples.   From  his experience in running a multi-fare  food\r\n\r\ncourt, George struck on the idea of putting traditional Asian\r\n\r\nfavourites like \"bak hu\" and \"tom yam\" into bread  and  buns.\r\n\r\nHe  started  BreadTalk, which has now grown to 13 outlets  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and is now planning his expansion into  China  and\r\n\r\nthe rest of the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, neither Bill Lee nor George Quek started off in\r\n\r\nhigh-tech  or  knowledge-based  businesses.   But  they  have\r\n\r\nsucceeded  by  experimenting and investing in  new  concepts,\r\n\r\ntaking   calculated  risks  and  executing  their  strategies\r\n\r\ncarefully.   Both  firms  received  grants  and  loans   from\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  help  them in their  innovations.   Both  are\r\n\r\nlocated  at JTC's Kampong Ampat Foodlink, which is a facility\r\n\r\ndesigned   to   allow   for   cost   synergies   among   food\r\n\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the LETAS scheme, which I mentioned earlier, helps\r\n\r\nSMEs  improve their business capabilities in a range of areas\r\n\r\n-   product,   business   and   market   development,   brand\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   as   well   as   technical   and    operations\r\n\r\nimprovements.  Even in the economic downturn, the  number  of\r\n\r\ngrants  approved under LETAS increased by 11% last year.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  SPRING Singapore's Jumpstart E-commerce  Programme\r\n\r\nhas  helped one in three SMEs make e-commerce part  of  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  operations,  by getting them  to  adopt  affordable\r\n\r\nready-made shared solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed expressed concern that\r\n\r\nimproving  the  productivity of companies may  lead  to  less\r\n\r\nemployment.  Sir, if our enterprises are more productive  and\r\n\r\nefficient, they will be more competitive.  Most, even if  not\r\n\r\nall, will hire more workers as their business volume goes up.\r\n\r\nA  productive economy and vibrant enterprise scene will  also\r\n\r\nattract  new  investments  and  new  businesses,  leading  to\r\n\r\ngreater employment overall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Miss Penny Low asked that Government help SMEs who\r\n\r\ncannot  upgrade  and  cannot  compete  effectively  to   exit\r\n\r\ngracefully.  As a general principle, entry and exit  have  to\r\n\r\nbe left to the market.  However, the SME retail sector in HDB\r\n\r\nestates  faces a special, structural problem.   There  is  an\r\n\r\nexcess  supply  of  shops  in some  estates  and  not  enough\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Some rationalisation is unavoidable and will  help\r\n\r\nthose  shopkeepers whose business remains viable.  As Members\r\n\r\nknow,  the  Government  has piloted  a  Voluntary  Retirement\r\n\r\nScheme  in  seven  selected estates.   Last  year,  about  95\r\n\r\nshopkeepers, or 35% of those affected, decided to take up the\r\n\r\noffer  of ex-gratia payment and exit from the business.   The\r\n\r\nERC  Subcommittee  on Domestic Enterprises is  considering  a\r\n\r\nproposal to allow merchants or neighbourhood associations  to\r\n\r\ninitiate  the  Voluntary Retirement Scheme  (VRS)  for  their\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods, rather than leaving the selection to HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be mistaken to assume that the entire SME\r\n\r\nsector  is  mired  in  problems.  I have  highlighted  a  few\r\n\r\nexamples  of  enterprising SMEs that  have  thrived  in  this\r\n\r\ndifficult business environment.  SMEs, as a whole,  are  also\r\n\r\nexpressing more confidence now that the economic downturn  is\r\n\r\nbottoming out.  SPRING Singapore's survey of SMEs in December\r\n\r\nlast  year  showed  that 82% of SMEs  felt  that  they  could\r\n\r\nsurvive at least seven months or longer, up sharply from  46%\r\n\r\nof  SMEs in July.  In March this year, another survey  showed\r\n\r\nthat  the  proportion of SMEs reporting worsening  cash  flow\r\n\r\ndropped to 56% from 86% in December.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will do what it can to improve and refine\r\n\r\nthe assistance it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrenders  to SMEs.  But Government can only act as a catalyst,\r\n\r\nand  not  a  continuing  source  of  support.   We  can  give\r\n\r\npromising firms a leg up, not a crutch.  The best way for the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  help SMEs grow is to provide a pro-enterprise\r\n\r\nenvironment  that  facilitates the growth of  enterprises  by\r\n\r\nkeeping  taxes low, removing barriers to entry and exit,  and\r\n\r\nmaintaining  a level playing field for all competitors.   The\r\n\r\nSMEs  are  responsible for their own survival and  growth  in\r\n\r\nthis   competition.   If  they  continuously  upgrade   their\r\n\r\ncapabilities,  develop  their human capital,  and  invest  in\r\n\r\ninnovations,  they  can  get ahead  of  the  competition  and\r\n\r\nwithstand the vicissitudes of the economic environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon asked that Government upgrade and\r\n\r\nrevitalise  Jurong Industrial Estate.  Jurong  is  a  vibrant\r\n\r\nindustrial  district.  It has seen several new  state-of-the-art  specialised parks, such as Tuas Biomedical Park,  Jurong\r\n\r\nIsland  Petrochemical  Hub and the  Chemical  Logistics  Hub.\r\n\r\nHowever,  although there have been new housing  developments,\r\n\r\nshopping centres and leisure facilities in the Jurong region,\r\n\r\nJurong  was planned as a predominantly industrial-use estate.\r\n\r\nThis  has given rise to the perception of a lack of  buzz  in\r\n\r\nJurong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC and URA are therefore looking at how Jurong can be\r\n\r\nreinvigorated,  including introducing  more  mixed  uses  and\r\n\r\ncreating a work-live-learn-play environment in the long term.\r\n\r\nThe  transport infrastructure in Jurong will also be improved\r\n\r\n- last October, the Ministry of Transport announced plans for\r\n\r\na  new  light  rapid transit line in the Jurong  region.   In\r\n\r\naddition, JTC is undertaking en bloc development of selective\r\n\r\nsites  to rejuvenate the estate.  And the experience of those\r\n\r\nen  bloc exercises so far has been very successful.  We  will\r\n\r\nget more feedback from Mrs Yu-Foo and other MPs in Jurong  as\r\n\r\nour plans progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min has highlighted that industrialists in\r\n\r\nTuas   find  it  difficult  to  attract  employees,  due   to\r\n\r\ninadequate public transportation infrastructure there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  have  had similar feedback from industrialists.  As  Tuas\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Estate is new, public transportation  is  not  as\r\n\r\nextensive or as frequent as desired because of the high costs\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  providing a service to cater  for  the  peakish\r\n\r\nridership over a widely dispersed area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JTC is currently working with the Ministry of Transport\r\n\r\nand  the  public transport operator (SBS Transit) to  improve\r\n\r\npublic  transport  service levels. As an immediate  solution,\r\n\r\nSBS Transit will be refining some of the existing services to\r\n\r\nprovide   a  direct  connection  to  Tuas  and  shorten   the\r\n\r\ntravelling time from Boon Lay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng and Mr Ong Kian Min had commented that\r\n\r\ntenants in JTC's amenity centres should be allowed extensions\r\n\r\nin  their leases beyond the current nine years.  Mr Ang  also\r\n\r\nsuggested  fixed rental rates to help keep costs  down.   JTC\r\n\r\namenities  are leased out on 3-year terms, with an option  to\r\n\r\nextend  the lease for a further 3-year term, up to a  maximum\r\n\r\nof nine years.  The amenities are put for re-tender after the\r\n\r\nnine years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-tendering is part and parcel of market competition.\r\n\r\nIt  provides  opportunities for new entrants, and establishes\r\n\r\nfair  market  value.  Existing operators should  be  able  to\r\n\r\nrecover  their  investments over a nine-year  period  as  the\r\n\r\nupfront investment in canteens is not high.  Re-tendering  to\r\n\r\nestablish  fair  market value is better than  JTC  having  to\r\n\r\ndecide  on an appropriate fixed rental.  JTC recognises  that\r\n\r\nits  earlier tender mechanism may have contributed to  overly\r\n\r\nhigh  bidding  by new entrants.  It has improved  its  tender\r\n\r\nmechanism  to ensure that the process is fair and transparent\r\n\r\nto  all  parties.   It  has introduced premature  termination\r\n\r\nclauses to discourage bidders from submitting unrealistically\r\n\r\nhigh bids just to try out.  Other recent improvements include\r\n\r\nan  open  e-bidding system, somewhat similar to the open  COE\r\n\r\nbidding system, where bids are transparent for all to see.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ntouch on the issue of promoting entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the new tax measures are welcome, the basic issue\r\n\r\nfor entrepreneurs is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncost first and foremost, and whether they get taxed at 24% or\r\n\r\n20%  rate is just a small issue.  I can personally vouch  for\r\n\r\nthis, given my many experiences of starting up companies  and\r\n\r\nworking with start-ups.  Entrepreneurs aim to create so  much\r\n\r\nof  wealth that the tax rate is a small issue because of  the\r\n\r\ngreat  wealth they are going to create.  It becomes an  issue\r\n\r\nafter they have become rich.  Their real worry in their early\r\n\r\ndays  is  whether they survive or not, and for sure the  cost\r\n\r\nfactor is the biggest issue for them.  They will be extremely\r\n\r\ngrateful  and  will  remain very loyal  to  Singapore  if  we\r\n\r\naddress their survival concerns, and this involves costs  and\r\n\r\naccess to funds.  The immediate impact of the tax issue is to\r\n\r\nattract the already rich and the already successful.  I think\r\n\r\nwe  should also try to focus on entrepreneurs who are  trying\r\n\r\nand who are basically \"PhDs\" - poor, hungry and driven.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the financial cost of creating new\r\n\r\ncompanies,  one  big factor is the cost of failure.   And  by\r\n\r\ncost of failure, I do not just mean the social cost (that one\r\n\r\nis  one  of  intolerance to failure, which we have a  problem\r\n\r\nhere  in Singapore), but also the high price one has  to  pay\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  high cost of living in  Singapore.   Having\r\n\r\nfailed in a business may mean one never being able to  own  a\r\n\r\nhouse  or  a car for a long time. Such fears deter many  from\r\n\r\ntaking risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I can spend a lot of time talking about\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship as I have spent a lot of time on it, I would\r\n\r\nlike  just  to go to some specific issues which I  feel  need\r\n\r\naddressing.  I am very encouraged, listening to the  Minister\r\n\r\nand  the  Senior Minister of State, that there are  many  new\r\n\r\ninitiatives, and I think these will really help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of EDB's SEED financial scheme, I think\r\n\r\nthat  has  helped a lot.  Can I suggest that we  include  the\r\n\r\namounts  that an entrepreneur may have already spent  on  his\r\n\r\nown,  including  in  kind  or in  cash,  and  also  what  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneur  may  be  spending from his  own  pocket  moving\r\n\r\nforward, when they consider matching the grant, and not  just\r\n\r\nmatching  what the new investors are going to put  in?   This\r\n\r\nwill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngreatly help them.  Matching something that he is going to\r\n\r\nput in over time can mean that he may draw down on the SEED\r\n\r\nfunds over a period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is one of streamlining rules and\r\n\r\nregulations  to  cut  down on red tape, especially  licensing\r\n\r\nrequirements.   We  talked about the 12  licences  needed  to\r\n\r\noperate  a  pub.   In this respect, we have a  pro-enterprise\r\n\r\npanel  that  the Government has set up.  This has  been  very\r\n\r\neffective  in trying to resolve issues that businesses  face.\r\n\r\nThis  is  headed  by  Mr Lim Siong Guan, who  has  tremendous\r\n\r\ninfluence  over  many  Ministries.   I  hope  that  the  pro-enterprise panel will be a permanent feature so that  we  can\r\n\r\ncontinue to address the issue of red tape and bureaucracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also make it easier to register as well as to\r\n\r\nshut  down companies.  The nature of entrepreneurship is that\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  have limited resources and have  to  face  the\r\n\r\nrisk  of  failure.   While there have  been  improvements  in\r\n\r\nsetting up companies, we should make it even easier to  start\r\n\r\nup  companies.   Shutting down companies can be  a  nightmare\r\n\r\ntoo,  and it is a very onerous task and takes a long time  to\r\n\r\nhappen and costs a lot of money. We need to change the  rules\r\n\r\nto  allow  easier shutting down of companies, in addition  to\r\n\r\neasier  setting up of companies.  The cost of  maintaining  a\r\n\r\ncompany  is  also  an issue, where there are many  regulatory\r\n\r\nrequirements  from the Registry of Companies  and  Businesses\r\n\r\nand also from IRAS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I suggest that, in addition to the many financing\r\n\r\nschemes and funds that were given to VCs, we set up a special\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship fund that can be farmed out to  a  group  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean  businessmen or entrepreneurs  who  already  have\r\n\r\nexperience.   They could manage this fund on  behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   I think this will complement the VCs  that  are\r\n\r\nalready here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the issue of HDB shophouses, the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State mentioned this.  Can I suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nvacant HDB shophouses that come about be converted to offices\r\n\r\nfor technology\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntype  of  start-ups that are basically light  industries  and\r\n\r\nthose  which are non-polluting?  This, in addition to helping\r\n\r\nto  lower cost, will help make the neighbourhood more vibrant\r\n\r\nand  also increase availability of space, thus allowing  cost\r\n\r\nof commercial spaces to come down further.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, we all know, is today's buzzword.  In fact,\r\n\r\nSenior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, speaking on entrepreneurship in\r\n\r\nSingapore  earlier  this year at the Ho Rih  Hwa  Lecture  on\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurial Culture, gave his prognosis.  I  suppose  the\r\n\r\ndebate  will continue whether we can nurture entrepreneurship\r\n\r\nor  whether it is born with such people.  MTI should look  at\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship from a wider perspective as to  how  we  can\r\n\r\ninculcate  a spirit of enterprise in our people.   This  seed\r\n\r\nfor  the spirit of enterprise can be sowed only if people are\r\n\r\nwilling to take risks, meaning less kiasuism, and willing  to\r\n\r\ngo  out  and  be more adventurous.  For example, we,  at  the\r\n\r\nNorth-East  CDC, have been looking at this issue and  try  to\r\n\r\nsee how we can help to bring about this spirit of enterprise.\r\n\r\nWe   are  encouraging,  for  example,  students  to  go  into\r\n\r\nbusiness.   Hai  Sing Catholic School, for example,  will  be\r\n\r\nmarketing  second-hand pots and pans as well as flowers  from\r\n\r\nthe  school  garden through their own Entrepreneurship  Club.\r\n\r\nSo  we are also encouraging more schools to look into setting\r\n\r\nup entrepreneurship clubs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the Innovation and Creative Fund to develop\r\n\r\nthe spirit of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship among the\r\n\r\nresidents  of  North-East CDC.  We are working with  ITE  and\r\n\r\nShell  to also look at how we can bring about this objective.\r\n\r\nWe  also have a Dare-To-Dream Fund where we want to encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to go out of their way to look at new ideas and  even\r\n\r\nventure into something where they take risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question I would like to ask is whether, in fact,\r\n\r\nMTI  and  its agencies, for example, the A*STAR,  could  also\r\n\r\nlook   into   areas   where  we  can  work  with   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations, even CDCs, and see how we can bring about this\r\n\r\nspirit of enterprise amongst our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\npromoting entrepreneurship has been a hot topic in  the  last\r\n\r\nfew  years.

I am very happy  to  hear  the\r\n\r\nMinister's response to the many concerns that were addressed.\r\n\r\nI have three, of which the Minister has addressed.  I will go\r\n\r\nto the last concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society needs an attitude and cultural change to promote\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  We must go beyond the mere  acceptance  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  failures.  We must welcome them,  like  we  welcome\r\n\r\nKhoo Swee Chiow when he failed to cross the North Pole - with\r\n\r\nwide open and accepting arms.  It is a fact that nine out  of\r\n\r\n10  businesses  will  fail.   But a  true  entrepreneur  will\r\n\r\npersevere  and press on.   They would have learnt  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nvaluable  experience  by their first failure.   The  Ministry\r\n\r\nwould like to look into how society can actually support them\r\n\r\nto  restart again.  After gaining these valuable lessons,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  most shameful if they cannot restart their business\r\n\r\ndue to prejudice, lack of funding or support.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must educate our society to adopt this change.\r\n\r\nGetting  good  and  high paying jobs  in  private  or  public\r\n\r\nservices  should  be seen as second or third  career  choice.\r\n\r\nThe  first career choice should be to venture out on our  own\r\n\r\nas  an  entrepreneur.  This we need to educate the  shift  in\r\n\r\nmindset, especially on the parents.  The Ministry would  also\r\n\r\nlike  to consider working with the Education Ministry to send\r\n\r\nsome of the tertiary students, who are studying business,  to\r\n\r\ngo  into  the  smaller  businesses and SMEs  for  internship,\r\n\r\nunderstudy and learn from these entrepreneurs.  This will cut\r\n\r\nshort the learning process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to conclude by asking the Minister\r\n\r\nif  he believes in promoting entrepreneurship as a core value\r\n\r\nof  our new society.  If so, how would the Ministry intend to\r\n\r\npromote it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua mentioned\r\n\r\nyesterday that unglamorous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nold   economy  industries  might  feel  left   out   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's attention, an issue that the Senior Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  has  answered.   I have a similar  concern  about  new\r\n\r\neconomy  sectors in that when Government policies, investment\r\n\r\npromotion efforts and resources are directed towards  certain\r\n\r\nnew  growth areas, such as R&D, life sciences, chemicals  and\r\n\r\ninfocomm, could we inadvertently let other promising  sectors\r\n\r\nslip  by  as they are not on our radar screen?  For  example,\r\n\r\nwhere were we when the first wave of Internet companies  took\r\n\r\noff  in the US?  Innovators and entrepreneurs who are in  the\r\n\r\nignored sectors feel discouraged because what they do is  not\r\n\r\nfashionable.  I do not think our Government agencies actually\r\n\r\nbrush them away.  But they do feel that insufficient interest\r\n\r\nand encouragement are given to their endeavours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we must remain focused, I would like to ask how\r\n\r\nour  new growth areas are determined and arrived at.  And how\r\n\r\ncan  we  be  sure that these darlings of today  will  achieve\r\n\r\ntheir  potential in the years ahead?  What if we  are  wrong?\r\n\r\nCan we have some ways to catch all and nurture creativity and\r\n\r\ntap  bright innovative ideas in as many sectors as  possible?\r\n\r\nWill  we  be  able  to catch the next big wave  as  early  as\r\n\r\npossible?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should develop more creative talents. To start the\r\n\r\ncreativity revolution among Singaporeans, we should set aside\r\n\r\nmore  money and put in place an ongoing programme  to  create\r\n\r\njust for the sake of creating, and not to be driven initially\r\n\r\nby  business  and  commercial considerations.   The  business\r\n\r\npeople  can  come  in later to see how to  make  use  of  the\r\n\r\ninnovations  and inventions that have been created  and  make\r\n\r\ncommercial applications out of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after we have come up with an innovative idea, the\r\n\r\nnext  step is to explore the full commercial benefits of  the\r\n\r\ninnovation.   We  have  quite  a  number  of  internationally\r\n\r\nrenowned   research  institutes.   Let   us   say   our   R&D\r\n\r\nlaboratories  come  out  with a new invention  and  they  are\r\n\r\nlooking  to  sell  this  invention to someone  who  sees  the\r\n\r\npotential and who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan realise the full commercial value of the product.  If  an\r\n\r\ninnovator  approaches a Singapore company, even  a  GLC,  how\r\n\r\nmuch  can  a  local company, with its limited  market  reach,\r\n\r\noffer  for  it compared to an American or international  MNC,\r\n\r\nwho  has the marketing clout and international brand to  push\r\n\r\nthe  sales?   If  it  comes  to a  bidding  war  to  buy  the\r\n\r\ninvention, of course, the MNC, with its access to hundreds of\r\n\r\nmillions,  if not billions of consumers worldwide,  would  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  pay  a  higher price and it  would  be  in  the\r\n\r\ncommercial interest of the local innovators to get  the  best\r\n\r\ndeal  for  themselves.  Where does that leave our  innovation\r\n\r\neffort?   Is  it to do research and come out with good  ideas\r\n\r\nonly  to  be  taken  over  by large  foreign  companies?   To\r\n\r\ncomplement  and  support our efforts in innovation,  we  must\r\n\r\nalso  build  up  or acquire strong marketing  companies  with\r\n\r\nstrong  brand presence in the international marketplace.   We\r\n\r\nshould pay more attention to this aspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Sir, I thank Members for their useful\r\n\r\ncomments on encouraging entrepreneurship in Singapore.  These\r\n\r\nare  very  relevant as a vibrant enterprise system will  help\r\n\r\ndrive  our future economic growth.  Let me touch on  some  of\r\n\r\nthe issues that they have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Dr John Chen suggested that we should\r\n\r\nencourage bright business ideas from anywhere in the world to\r\n\r\ntake  root here.  We agree.  This was why in 1999,  DPM  Tony\r\n\r\nTan launched and led the Technopreneurship 21 programme.  Its\r\n\r\naim  was to foster the growth of start-ups, especially  those\r\n\r\nwhich  build on high technology, innovation and the  creation\r\n\r\nof intellectual property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min made a good point when he said that we\r\n\r\nshould  not confine ourselves just to this area.  Recognising\r\n\r\nthat  start-ups  are not just in high technology  areas,  T21\r\n\r\nwill  be  broadened  into Enterprise  21,  to  develop  in  a\r\n\r\nholistic  manner  an  enterprise ecosystem  that  would  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  a compelling base for all enterprises -  local  or\r\n\r\nforeign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Members - that access to capital,\r\n\r\navailability of capital is a key factor to develop enterprise\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   What  we  need is a deep  and  sophisticated\r\n\r\ncapital market that caters to a spectrum of risk appetite for\r\n\r\nenterprises at all stages of their growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, in the last few days, many Members\r\n\r\nhave cautioned against too much direct Government involvement\r\n\r\nin business.  Along the same line, our approach to enterprise\r\n\r\nfinancing  should  be to let the market allocate  capital  to\r\n\r\ncompanies  with the best ideas, business plans and  execution\r\n\r\nskills.  Government should step in to help catalyse this only\r\n\r\nwhen there is a market gap, a market failure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr John Chen had highlighted that there may be just such\r\n\r\na  gap  for  companies at the early start-up stage.   As  SMS\r\n\r\nTharman  said, recognising this, EDB has launched the Startup\r\n\r\nEnterprise  Development Scheme (SEEDS) last year.   Mr  Singh\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  SEEDS  also matches the  investment  of  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneur.  However, the Government, as Members have said,\r\n\r\nmay not be the best judge of private sector initiatives.   So\r\n\r\nit  is  essential  that it remains driven by  private  sector\r\n\r\nevaluation with the Government matching the investment of the\r\n\r\nthird party investor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many businessmen have told me that our financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions tend to give loans only if these are  backed  by\r\n\r\ntangible assets.  Other forms of credit assessment,  such  as\r\n\r\nthose  based on cash flow projections, have yet to take  off.\r\n\r\nSome  have suggested why do we not have something similar  to\r\n\r\nwhat the US have, which is the Small Business Association.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the approach which SPRING Singapore has taken is\r\n\r\nthat  instead  of  concentrating SME financing  in  a  single\r\n\r\ninstitution, such as a Small Business Association, it spreads\r\n\r\nit  to  more  than  20  participating financial  institutions\r\n\r\n(PFIs)  under LEFS.  These PFIs are a good mix of both  local\r\n\r\nand  foreign financial institutions with some focusing on SME\r\n\r\nlending,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Heller  Financial, Sing Investment and  Hong  Leong\r\n\r\nFinance.   SMEs can thus choose from a range of PFIs  in  the\r\n\r\npool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further ensure that access to financing for small\r\n\r\nbusinesses  is  not  hampered by lack of industry  knowledge,\r\n\r\nSPRING Singapore would welcome private sector initiative - be\r\n\r\nit  from the Singapore Business Federation, TiE, or any other\r\n\r\nchamber  or  industry association, who  is  willing  to  come\r\n\r\nforward  and  provide more of such financing.  If  they  meet\r\n\r\nwith MAS' regulations, SPRING can then accord them PFI status\r\n\r\nto allow them to offer loans to their SME partners or members\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government bearing a portion of the risk which  is\r\n\r\ncurrently 80:20.  This will give SMEs a wider choice of  loan\r\n\r\nproviders with varying thresholds of risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min made an important observation on\r\n\r\ninnovation.   He said that good business ideas need  at  some\r\n\r\nstage  to  be commercialised and how do we capture this.   As\r\n\r\nTharman   mentioned  earlier  there  are  various  assistance\r\n\r\nschemes  to  help  not  just  technology  but  non-technology\r\n\r\ncompanies to actually expand their businesses.  He  gave  the\r\n\r\nexample of BreadTalk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, A*STAR created \"Exploit Technologies\" to\r\n\r\ncentrally   manage  the  intellectual  property  created   by\r\n\r\nresearch  institutes and to facilitate the efficient transfer\r\n\r\nof technology to industry.  Through this mechanism, we foster\r\n\r\nhealthy   collaboration  between  Research   Institutes   and\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   To  illustrate,  the  Singapore  Institute   of\r\n\r\nManufacturing Technology collaborated with a local SME, Prime\r\n\r\nElectrical  Products,  to develop a  lifestyle  water  heater\r\n\r\nwhich  is  now  selling  regionally.   Another  example,  the\r\n\r\nInstitute  for  Communications  Research  has  licensed   two\r\n\r\npatents  to  a company called iDetect Technology to  help  it\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  Microwave-Guard.  This is  a  credit-card  size\r\n\r\ndevice  that measures radiation leakage from microwave  ovens\r\n\r\nand warns the user if the leakage exceeds safety levels.  The\r\n\r\ncompany has plans to sell the product into Australia, Europe,\r\n\r\nJapan and the US.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support these efforts, it is critical, as Minister\r\n\r\nGeorge Yeo said, that we protect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintellectual  property.  It takes years of  painstaking  hard\r\n\r\nwork   to  come  up  with  an  invention  and  to  apply   it\r\n\r\ncommercially.   Futuristic as Star Wars is,  even  Yoda,  the\r\n\r\nsage  in the series, could not foresee that an illegal  clone\r\n\r\nof  Episode  II  of Star Wars could be circulating  over  the\r\n\r\nInternet  a  week  before  its grand  premiere.   So  at  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  we  say,  may the force be with  the  creators  of\r\n\r\nintellectual property.  To bring that about, my  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nworking  with  the Ministry of Law to review our intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty   protection   laws   comprehensively   to   further\r\n\r\nstrengthen our regime and encourage innovation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have spoken on rules. Rules provide\r\n\r\nbusiness    certainty   and   a   transparent,   corrupt-free\r\n\r\nenvironment.  But we must be careful not to stifle creativity\r\n\r\nand  innovation  with unnecessary rules.  Mr  Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\nsuggested   that   the   Government  streamline   rules   and\r\n\r\nregulations and to incorporate sunset clauses so  that  rules\r\n\r\nhave  expiry  dates.  The Entrepreneurship and  International\r\n\r\nSub-committee  of  the  ERC, which Mr  Inderjit  Singh  is  a\r\n\r\nmember,  has  proposed  that there be  a  mandatory  periodic\r\n\r\nreview  of  rules  by  a  high-powered  Rules  Review   Panel\r\n\r\ncomprising   senior   civil  servants  and   private   sector\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.   The matter is under consideration  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members, however, would be pleased to know that we\r\n\r\nalready  have a headstart in rules.  As Mr Singh said,  since\r\n\r\nSeptember  2000,  the  Head of the  civil  service  has  been\r\n\r\nchairing  a  Pro-Enterprise  Panel.   Mr  Singh  has  been  a\r\n\r\ndedicated  member  of the Panel, bringing fresh  perspectives\r\n\r\nand  ideas  for the review.  Since its set-up, the Panel  has\r\n\r\nreceived 344 suggestions, of which 145 have been accepted and\r\n\r\n59  pending review.  The Panel will continue to be  proactive\r\n\r\nin cutting red tape.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the OASIS project under MTI and MOF, which\r\n\r\nstands for Online Application System for Integrated Services.\r\n\r\nBy  putting  licence  applications for  starting  a  business\r\n\r\nonline, we aim to reduce the number of such licences  by  10%\r\n\r\nand average processing time from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree weeks to 10 days by the middle of next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh suggested also that we allow HDB\r\n\r\nshophouses  to be used for technology start-ups.   We  agree.\r\n\r\nSince 1999, HDB has revised its rules to allow shopkeepers to\r\n\r\nuse  their  shophouses for non-retail purposes, including  as\r\n\r\noffices,  showrooms and food shops.  HDB went a step  further\r\n\r\nto  liberalise the use of the living quarters above the shops\r\n\r\nin March 2001.  Now, shopkeepers can use or sublet the living\r\n\r\nquarters above shophouses for all commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh has also suggested that we make it easier to\r\n\r\nregister as well as to shut down companies and streamline the\r\n\r\nprocedures  for  maintaining  a  company.   The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance   set  up  the  Company  Legislation  and  Regulatory\r\n\r\nFramework  Committee (CLRFC) in December 1999 to undertake  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  review  of  our  company  law  and  regulatory\r\n\r\nframework.   The Committee recognised the need to  streamline\r\n\r\nand  simplify  incorporation and compliance requirements  for\r\n\r\nsmall   companies.    It   has  just   released   its   draft\r\n\r\nrecommendations on 9th May 2002 for public comment.   I  urge\r\n\r\nMr Singh and interested parties to give their feedback to the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  its  recommendations.   The  draft  report  is\r\n\r\navailable at the MOF website at www.mof.gov.sg.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond rules and regulations, we should study ways to\r\n\r\nliberalise  our markets to enlarge the private sector  space.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, it will ensure that our business costs are\r\n\r\nmarket-driven and competitive, which is a point  made  by  Mr\r\n\r\nLeong Horn Kee and Mr Inderjit Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked for an update on energy\r\n\r\nderegulation.  Much of this has been done.  We have separated\r\n\r\nthe   competitive  parts  of  the  business,  namely,   power\r\n\r\ngeneration  and retail, from the natural monopoly,  which  is\r\n\r\nthe  operation of the power grid.  This was effected when the\r\n\r\nnew  Electricity Act was passed in this House in  March  last\r\n\r\nyear.  Since then, we have seven new players in retailing and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  new  firms in generation.  The market rules  to  further\r\n\r\nimprove the energy market are going into its final tests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the retail sector, we will liberalise that in\r\n\r\nstages.  Since July 2001, we extended contestability from 100\r\n\r\nlarge  customers  to  200.  This means  that  for  these  200\r\n\r\nconsumers,  they  can  choose which  retailer  they  want  to\r\n\r\npurchase their energy from.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Energy Market Authority survey of some of these\r\n\r\nconsumers revealed that 86% of them enjoyed lower electricity\r\n\r\ncosts  after  the  restructuring exercise.  For  example,  in\r\n\r\nSeptember   last  year,  the  Civil  Aviation  Authority   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (CAAS)  managed to cut electricity  cost  by  30%.\r\n\r\nCAAS  will  pass these savings on to its tenants and  private\r\n\r\ndevelopers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the middle of next year, we plan to extend\r\n\r\ncontestability to another 10,500 large consumers.   The  rest\r\n\r\nof   the  consumers,  totalling  about  a  million  household\r\n\r\naccounts, will be opened in phases, starting towards the  end\r\n\r\nof 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong suggested yesterday that the Government\r\n\r\nshould  defray  part of the costs of companies going  abroad.\r\n\r\nIE  Singapore  has  certain schemes that  help  companies  in\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading  and  marketing  for  internationalisation.\r\n\r\nThese  schemes  are  rightly  to help  in  capacity-building,\r\n\r\nrather  than  pure cost subsidies.  In the larger  scheme  of\r\n\r\nthings,  however, the basic enabling business structure  must\r\n\r\nbe the general fiscal regime that has been enunciated in this\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members have spoken about building an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial culture.  I do not know whether entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nare  made  or  born.   But  I do know  that  many  attributes\r\n\r\nassociated  with  entrepreneurs: the  \"dare  to  experiment\",\r\n\r\n\"dare to fail\" spirit, can possibly be cultivated from young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I agree with Mr Zainul Abidin, Mr Inderjit Singh and\r\n\r\nMr  Steve  Chia's  call for education in entrepreneurship  in\r\n\r\nschools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  at  the community level.  MOE has cut curriculum content\r\n\r\nby up to 30% in some subjects, to allow the schools and their\r\n\r\nstudents  more  time  to  question, explore  and  experiment.\r\n\r\nSeveral  of  our schools already have specific programmes  to\r\n\r\nnurture in our pupils an enterprising spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperative societies, which are recognised CCAs, have\r\n\r\nbeen  formed  in  some schools.  Some of our junior  colleges\r\n\r\nhave  started Young Enterprise Clubs to develop  and  nurture\r\n\r\nfuture entrepreneurs.  Schools on their own have collaborated\r\n\r\nwith CDCs and business corporations to solicit grants to fund\r\n\r\ntheir various business projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March this year, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan\r\n\r\nlaunched  Bizworld,  a not-for-profit programme  that  brings\r\n\r\nreal-world business experiences to children between Primary 5\r\n\r\nand  Secondary  2.   It  is a business  simulation  programme\r\n\r\ncreated  by  Tim Draper, the Managing Director and Co-Founder\r\n\r\nof  Draper  Fisher, to help students in the  US  learn  about\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.  Its success has prompted DFJ to  replicate\r\n\r\nthe  programme in Singapore.  With the help of EDB,  Bizworld\r\n\r\nwas  successfully  introduced to Anglo-Chinese  (Independent)\r\n\r\nSchool.  Another 39 schools have signed up their teachers  to\r\n\r\nbe trained to teach this programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do more to widen the access for the young and\r\n\r\nadults to entrepreneurship education.  What I think, however,\r\n\r\nis  hard to teach is the passion that Mr Inderjit Singh spoke\r\n\r\nabout.  I think passionate entrepreneurs will not be deterred\r\n\r\nby  the  cost of failure.  The worst downside to  failure  is\r\n\r\ngenerally  the same in any country - bankruptcy.  Whether  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or  any other country, a bankrupt is  unlikely  to\r\n\r\nafford  a  car or house.  To make it easier for entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nto  start  afresh,  this House has passed amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nBankruptcy Act in 1999 to address some of these issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How our society views risk-taking and failures, as both\r\n\r\nDr  John Chen and Mr Inderjit Singh said, will affect to some\r\n\r\ndegree the quality of entrepreneurship but, ultimately, it is\r\n\r\npassion and conviction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof entrepreneurs that will make the difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, may I make some remarks on remaking\r\n\r\nSingapore?   Much has been made of the Remaking of  Singapore\r\n\r\nCommittees.  Let me give my perspectives on this.  There  are\r\n\r\nno  quick fixes here.  I sense that some feel that we  should\r\n\r\nwrap  up quickly, have less discussions and debate, and  come\r\n\r\nout  with  the magic formula, so that we can get on with  it.\r\n\r\nAladdin's  lamps  are  as  rare in Singapore  as  in  Arabia.\r\n\r\nRemaking  Singapore  is  a  process.   The  Economic   Review\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  the  Government  are  setting  the  strategic\r\n\r\narchitecture to achieve our vision of an entrepreneurship and\r\n\r\nknowledge-driven    economy   with    globally    competitive\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and service sectors.  Debate and discussion are\r\n\r\ncritical, so that our strategic intent is understood  by  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, without which we will fail.  To intercept  this\r\n\r\nfuture,   I   believe  requires  a  process   of   successive\r\n\r\napproximations of what needs to be done, rather  than  a  new\r\n\r\ndetailed blueprint that is cast in stone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the famous Spanish poet, Antonio Machado said:\r\n\r\n\"Pilgrims,  ask not where the road is.

First, in relation\r\n\r\nto  Sentosa,  perhaps we should also not forget the  offshore\r\n\r\nislands.   Many Singaporeans in fact go all the way to  Batam\r\n\r\nor even Bintan for resorts.  So, please do not forget that we\r\n\r\ncan  also  develop  our offshore islands  as  another  resort\r\n\r\ndestination for Singaporeans, besides Sentosa.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to address my second remark to Mr\r\n\r\nRaymond  Lim.   I have heard of this new committee  reviewing\r\n\r\nthe  formation  of companies.  I would like to  give  him  an\r\n\r\nimmediate  feedback:  one  of the rules  that  I  find  quite\r\n\r\ncumbersome  is  that,  for  the  registration  of   Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies,  domestic addresses, ie, HDB addresses or  private\r\n\r\nhome addresses,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot be used as the registered address of a company.

It\r\n\r\nwas  a  trying year; it was a watershed year.  We watched  in\r\n\r\nhorror  and  shock  as  the World Trade  Centre  Twin  Towers\r\n\r\ncollapsed  into  a heap of rubble right before  our  eyes  on\r\n\r\ntelevision.   Thousands perished.  September 11  changed  our\r\n\r\nlives.   The world is not the same anymore.  Terrorism  looms\r\n\r\nlarge.  Terrorism can strike anywhere, anytime at anyone.  We\r\n\r\nhave to be prepared.  We have to be alert.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nations have to sink their differences and unite in\r\n\r\ncountering   terrorism  and  preserve  lives.    Individuals,\r\n\r\ncorporations  and nations have, one and all,  to  redo  their\r\n\r\nsums,   reassess   their  positions  and  re-engineer   their\r\n\r\nstrategies and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntactics.   Being  the prime victim as well as the  superpower\r\n\r\nand  leader  of the free world, the United States  takes  the\r\n\r\nlead  in combating and countering terrorism.  Nations  around\r\n\r\nthe   world  have  come  together  to  share  resources   and\r\n\r\nintelligence   in   implementing   counter-measures   against\r\n\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism is global, so must be the fight against\r\n\r\nterrorism.  Likewise, Singapore has come out strongly against\r\n\r\nterrorism.  We have worked with the United States  and  other\r\n\r\nnations to counter terrorism.  It is the right thing  to  do.\r\n\r\nWe  have to stand up and be counted.  It is also, Sir, in our\r\n\r\ninterest,  as  a small nation, to do so.  We are  vulnerable.\r\n\r\nWe  need to work with other nations.  If not, when we are  in\r\n\r\ntrouble  and we ask for help, they will ask, \"Where were  you\r\n\r\nwhen you were needed most?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within Southeast Asia, September 11 has opened up\r\n\r\npotential  fault lines of race and religion across the  whole\r\n\r\nregion.   Religious fundamentalism and terrorism could  be  a\r\n\r\nvolatile  mix  threatening the peace  and  stability  of  the\r\n\r\nregion as well as the economic well-being of our people.  The\r\n\r\ncase  of JI clearly confirmed the international dimension  of\r\n\r\nterrorism.    Singapore,  KL,  Manila   and   Jakarta   need,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  to  liaise  closely on  preventive  measures  and\r\n\r\ncounter-terrorism.  The Minister may wish to comment  on  the\r\n\r\nstate of cooperation amongst the ASEAN partners on this issue\r\n\r\nand how we can further strengthen our security network in the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the strategic landscape has indeed changed.\r\n\r\nSeptember 11 has altered the triangular relationship  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  US, China and Japan, and changed and altered the balance\r\n\r\nof  power  in  this  region.  China's relationship  with  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States has turned for the better after September  11.\r\n\r\nBoth are now combating the common enemy in terrorism.  China,\r\n\r\nas  we  know,  has  its  own  Muslim  separatist  problem  in\r\n\r\nXinjiang.    Therefore,  in  this  climate,  the  spy   plane\r\n\r\nincident,  the Taiwan issue and human rights are now  put  on\r\n\r\nthe  backburner and are not so contentious.  And China  glows\r\n\r\nin the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlimelight  of  WTO, the APEC Summit and the coming  Olympics.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a good turn of events for China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After September 11, Malaysia also has a new beginning in\r\n\r\nits relationship with the US.  All past frictions are happily\r\n\r\nforgotten, and Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir has found\r\n\r\na  new  role  as the moderate voice of Islamic nations.   And\r\n\r\nthis  is much welcomed and appreciated by Washington, as some\r\n\r\nof us have seen last night on CNN.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan, still struggling to recover from the long\r\n\r\nrecession, is taking a new look at defence, seeking  to  pass\r\n\r\nnew  legislation for its defence forces and to play a  larger\r\n\r\nrole,  and  the Japanese Prime Minister even made a  personal\r\n\r\nvisit to the Yasukuni Shrine, despite international outcry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US, for the first time, has committed a significant\r\n\r\nnumber   of   what  is  called  \"ground  trainers\"   in   the\r\n\r\nPhilippines.   This is the first time in years that  American\r\n\r\nground troops are back in the region.\r\n\r\nSir, what do we make of all these?  How do we manoeuvre as  a\r\n\r\nsmall  country?  How do we navigate in the new uncharted  and\r\n\r\ntreacherous  waters?  How do we create space and advance  our\r\n\r\nnational  interests when circumstances are clearly less  than\r\n\r\nfavourable?\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I continue with my next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, over the years, ASEAN had\r\n\r\nearned  its  spurs and won recognition as a  grouping  to  be\r\n\r\nreckoned  with.   ASEAN  gave  individual  ASEAN  nations   a\r\n\r\ncollective  voice  and  a  higher standing  in  international\r\n\r\nforums and meetings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nations and agencies do factor in ASEAN in their\r\n\r\nassessment  of  geopolitics, as well as  investments  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.  With President Surharto then at the helm of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  and  playing a positive leadership  role  in  the\r\n\r\nregion, ASEAN surged ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But times have changed. The Asian financial crisis and\r\n\r\nrecession  hover over the region. Surharto is  no  longer  in\r\n\r\ncharge and Indonesia is beset with internal problems.  In the\r\n\r\nmeantime, ASEAN has grown to ten.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is: is ASEAN becoming too large and too\r\n\r\ndisparate,  with nations as diverse as Myanmar, Cambodia  and\r\n\r\nLaos, with varying degrees of economic development, and  wide\r\n\r\nvarieties of political cultures and systems?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myanmar, for example, attracts a great deal of attention\r\n\r\nfrom  the international community and media over human rights\r\n\r\nissue.   Myanmar recently released Ms Aung San Suu  Kyi  from\r\n\r\nhouse  arrest.  This is a right step and a good  development.\r\n\r\nWould  the  Minister  please give us his  assessment  of  the\r\n\r\nlatest  development in Myanmar and whether it would  lead  to\r\n\r\nliberalisation  and opening of the country for  democracy  as\r\n\r\nwell as for foreign investment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall question is this: is ASEAN becoming\r\n\r\nunwieldy?   It  will be even more unwieldy  if  somehow  East\r\n\r\nTimor is admitted to ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the East Asian nations of China,\r\n\r\nTaiwan,  Korea  and  Japan  are pulling  ahead  of  ASEAN  in\r\n\r\neconomic   development  and,  in  particular,  in  attracting\r\n\r\nforeign investments.  ASEAN therefore faces the risk of being\r\n\r\nmarginalised  in  the  intense  competition  for  investment,\r\n\r\ntalent and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot do without ASEAN. It is there. But\r\n\r\nASEAN seems to have lost steam, lost its vigour - we can just\r\n\r\ncarry  on  with a limping ASEAN - but for what purpose?   But\r\n\r\ncan  we  find  a  new sense of purpose, a new  direction  for\r\n\r\nASEAN, a new lease of life for ASEAN?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister what role Singapore can play in\r\n\r\nre-engineering ASEAN, and making ASEAN relevant in the new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscenario  and  the  new  strategic  landscape.   How  can  we\r\n\r\nstrengthen ASEAN and create linkages with others outside  the\r\n\r\nregion, eg, the FTA with Japan and the USA?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are in the region, and would do our utmost to\r\n\r\nsupport ASEAN but, at the same time, we must not be boxed in,\r\n\r\nand should explore linkages globally.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, ASEAN faces\r\n\r\ngrave   challenges  today.   It  is  seen  by  outsiders   as\r\n\r\nfractured,  weak  and leaderless.  Some  of  its  states  are\r\n\r\nconstantly  quarrelling with each other and let us  not  name\r\n\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an urgent need to revive the spirit of ASEAN,\r\n\r\nthe spirit that once made it strong as a regional voice.   In\r\n\r\nits  early  years, ASEAN states considered internal communist\r\n\r\ninsurgencies  to be the most immediate threat. This  was  the\r\n\r\nthreat  that bound the states together and made ASEAN  united\r\n\r\nand  a  strong voice to be reckoned with.  Today,  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nstates  face another internal threat, and that is, terrorism.\r\n\r\nTerrorism   provides  ASEAN  with  the  new  opportunity   to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  its  relevance  to  regional  and  international\r\n\r\nsecurity.  It should be seized.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN's greatest potential as an international actor\r\n\r\nlies  in  its  abilities  to  coordinate  responses  to   the\r\n\r\nchallenge  of  terrorism.   I am  glad  to  note  that  ASEAN\r\n\r\nMinisters  will  meet  soon  to discuss  signing  a  pact  on\r\n\r\nterrorism, although it is a little late, but better late than\r\n\r\nnever.  The pact should not involve only grand pronouncements\r\n\r\nof  cooperation, as it is so often associated with ASEAN, but\r\n\r\nshould  also  come accompanied with some clear  and  decisive\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Indonesia has played a key role as a stabilising\r\n\r\nforce in ASEAN in the grouping's first 30 years and was  seen\r\n\r\nas  playing  a leadership role in its grouping's development.\r\n\r\nBut   today,  Indonesia's  preoccupation  with  its  domestic\r\n\r\npolitics  and economy has unfortunately diluted its  role  in\r\n\r\nASEAN.  Indonesia's revival is necessary to revitalise ASEAN.\r\n\r\nSingapore needs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto engage Indonesia more during this period.  What happens in\r\n\r\nIndonesia is beyond Singapore's control but ASEAN can  launch\r\n\r\ninitiatives  designed to help Indonesia  to  become  involved\r\n\r\nmore  effectively in regional affairs and to assist  them  in\r\n\r\ntheir economic recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One laudable move on Singapore's part was the proposed\r\n\r\nFree  Trade  Agreement  with the  US.   It  will  extend  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of the FTA to Batam and Bintan and ASEAN, in sectors\r\n\r\nsuch as information technology.  With that, ASEAN will become\r\n\r\na  more  attractive  place  for investment  by  American  and\r\n\r\nSingaporean companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are signs that Malaysia does not see the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  such  FTAs.  Malaysia's Prime Minister  Mahathir\r\n\r\nMohamad  was  reported  as  saying earlier  this  month  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  not  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  its\r\n\r\nmembership  in ASEAN if it continued to sign bilateral  trade\r\n\r\npacts with nations outside the region.  Sir, this is the time\r\n\r\nto  be  strengthening the investment climate in ASEAN.   Such\r\n\r\ncomments would not be helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN has played a useful role in engaging major powers,\r\n\r\nsuch as through the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN+3 and the\r\n\r\nASEAN+10 processes.  But it lacks strong effective leadership\r\n\r\nand  solidarity as a grouping to take full advantage of that.\r\n\r\nI  am not sure how long it can determine the agenda for these\r\n\r\nmulti-lateral  forums  involving  these  big  powers  if   it\r\n\r\ncontinues to appear weak and disunited.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister how Singapore proposes\r\n\r\nto  play its part in strengthening ASEAN in the face of these\r\n\r\nchallenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I agree largely with\r\n\r\nthe  sentiments  of my colleague before me on the  challenges\r\n\r\nthat ASEAN faces today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, ASEAN has seen many challenges that could have\r\n\r\nan   impact  on  its  status  and  standing  as  a   regional\r\n\r\norganisation.  You will recall at the height of the Cold War,\r\n\r\nASEAN was seen as a regional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbloc  that  was  capable of dealing with the  advancement  of\r\n\r\ncommunism  in Southeast Asia.  It had assumed a profile  that\r\n\r\nquickly  earned  the respect of members of the  international\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in recent years, the economic crisis and\r\n\r\nthe  resultant  political unrest and instability  within  the\r\n\r\nregion  have quite substantially affected the image of ASEAN.\r\n\r\nThese  events,  coupled with the inability of ASEAN  to  pull\r\n\r\nitself  together quickly on major trade and economic  issues,\r\n\r\nhave  raised  concerns about the continuing effectiveness  of\r\n\r\nASEAN's existence.  Indeed, these negative perceptions  have,\r\n\r\nto  a  large extent, been compounded by the emergence of such\r\n\r\nother  issues  such as the rampant burning  of  forest  which\r\n\r\ncontributes  to  the haze, the emergence of terrorists  cells\r\n\r\nand  the  inability  of some countries  to  deal  with  these\r\n\r\nproblems without requiring assistance from outsiders and  the\r\n\r\ninternal  political  instability that still  exists  in  many\r\n\r\ncountries  within  ASEAN.  To be sure, the  strength  of  the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  ASEAN which seeks to arrive at decisions  through\r\n\r\nconsensus is presently also its weakness, now that ASEAN  has\r\n\r\nbecome a 10-member organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with this negative perception, the economic\r\n\r\nchallenges  facing  ASEAN in the coming  years  do  not  look\r\n\r\npositive  either.  We have just heard the eloquent exposition\r\n\r\nof  Minister George Yeo on the challenges coming  from  North\r\n\r\nAsia,  especially from China and Korea, and these  challenges\r\n\r\nare  real.   For many ASEAN economies, the hollowing  out  of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and service industries to cheaper cost  centres\r\n\r\nin  China  is a serious problem and threatens to  derail  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  economic recovery within ASEAN.  The  fact  that\r\n\r\nChina  has  joined  the  WTO does not  give  Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries  much  comfort  and  in  fact  would  increase  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive  pressure for us.  Unless the growth  engines  of\r\n\r\nASEAN economies, such as the US, Japan and the EU continue to\r\n\r\npower  its  way  to recovery, it does not look  as  if  ASEAN\r\n\r\neconomies  are  likely to emerge from the doldrums  and  this\r\n\r\nwill continue to be a drag factor for us here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know from a recent publication that ASEAN, with\r\n\r\nits teeming population of 500 million people, is not punching\r\n\r\nat its strategic weight in relation to other regions and also\r\n\r\nregional organisations.  For example, APEC accounts  for  56%\r\n\r\nof  the world's GDP; the EU is almost 30% of the world's GDP;\r\n\r\nNAFTA  is  33% and the South Asian Organisation for  Regional\r\n\r\nCooperation  alone is 19%.  In the case of  ASEAN,  it  is  a\r\n\r\ndismal  1.5% of the world's GDP and if it gives us any cheer,\r\n\r\nwe  are only about marginally better than the Organisation of\r\n\r\nAfrican Unity, which contributes 1.4% of the world's GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these statistics are stark by comparison and\r\n\r\nobviously,  there is much that we have to do if  we  want  to\r\n\r\nbring  ASEAN, and together with it, the people, to  a  higher\r\n\r\nstandard and quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Singapore's position towards ASEAN is that\r\n\r\nit  plays  a significant role as a regional organisation.  We\r\n\r\nhave  sought  to  impress  on our ASEAN  colleagues  to  pull\r\n\r\ntogether  and  to  deal with the perception  that  ASEAN  now\r\n\r\nsuffers  from. Unless we begin to deal with this  perception,\r\n\r\nSir,  our  dialogue partners and international investors  may\r\n\r\nperceive  ASEAN as ineffective and may, in the  longer  term,\r\n\r\nmarginalise  us. We have to move towards greater integration,\r\n\r\nespecially with our newer members and to work more closely on\r\n\r\nthe  projects that we have started in order to help all ASEAN\r\n\r\nmembers to engage in the economy. It is important if we  want\r\n\r\nto  raise  the  status, the credibility and the  standing  of\r\n\r\nASEAN  as  a regional organisation. In that light,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nfriendly  dialogues that we have among members of  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nstates must continue to prevail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether we are making active progress on the projects that we\r\n\r\nstarted  out  with and active progress in further integrating\r\n\r\nthe various economies within ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

In joining hands with  the  other\r\n\r\nfounding  nations to form ASEAN, Singapore  must  have  hoped\r\n\r\nthat this economic grouping of Southeast Asian countries will\r\n\r\nhelp  provide  the  critical mass  to  attract  and  generate\r\n\r\ninvestment  and  trade both into and within the  region,  and\r\n\r\nwith  more investment in trade that life will get better  for\r\n\r\nall people living within this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a small open economy that is so reliant on free\r\n\r\ntrade and investment flows, Singapore knows that our fortunes\r\n\r\nwill  always be, to a given extent, influenced by, for better\r\n\r\nor  for worse, the standing and actions of ASEAN.  Hence, our\r\n\r\nparticipation in ASEAN is not something that is philosophical\r\n\r\nor  abstract.   It has direct bearing on our  well-being  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in more recent years, and especially after the\r\n\r\ndream  of the Pacific Rim Century evaporated after the  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial crisis, the different members of ASEAN have had  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with their own combination of social, economic as  well\r\n\r\nas  political  challenges.  The strength and cohesiveness  of\r\n\r\nASEAN now seem greatly weakened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, with the opening up of China, we know\r\n\r\nthat a growing proportion of investment inflows into Asia  is\r\n\r\nheading to the North East instead of to the South East.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthese  trends  are not insignificant.  If they  persist,  the\r\n\r\nregion  may  lose  its relevance to international  investors.\r\n\r\nWhen  that  happens,  the  risk  of  countries  resorting  to\r\n\r\nenlarging  their  share  of a shrinking  economic  pie  would\r\n\r\nincrease,   thereby   compounding   regional   problems   and\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore will be a beneficiary of a strong ASEAN, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask the Minister, what specific  steps  could\r\n\r\nSingapore  take  to  help strengthen  ASEAN  as  an  economic\r\n\r\nalliance  so  that  it  will  not  lose  its  relevance   and\r\n\r\nattractiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> ASEAN-10 is now\r\n\r\na  thousand pound gorilla.  It was half the size when it  was\r\n\r\nfirst  born.  With its 30 years of growth, somewhat unevenly,\r\n\r\nhave  come new problems.  Its vision now appears to be a  bit\r\n\r\ndiffused.   Its organs are not exactly working well together.\r\n\r\nIts  left paw sometimes does not like what its right  paw  is\r\n\r\ndoing.   And  it  is  currently fed  mainly  by  the  various\r\n\r\ngovernments.   In  other  words, its  environment  is  mainly\r\n\r\ngovernment-based.   It does not engage very  much  the  other\r\n\r\nsectors  of  ASEAN,  meaning the business sector,  and,  most\r\n\r\nimportantly, the people sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that the main problem with ASEAN now is that we\r\n\r\nare facing a problem of internal unity, of internal cohesion,\r\n\r\nin ASEAN, which did not exist when it was originally started.\r\n\r\nThen  the  vision  was  clear - it was  to  provide  for  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of the region, and perhaps the programmes were  not\r\n\r\nas  extensive as they are now.  So to this end, I  think,  at\r\n\r\nthis time, we must ask, whether as a founding member of ASEAN\r\n\r\nhow should we see ASEAN, given the problems that it is facing\r\n\r\nnow,  and in that respect, I have three issues which  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister will pay some attention to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, has the growth of ASEAN to ten provided\r\n\r\nmore problems for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisation and resulted in it being much weaker rather than\r\n\r\nstronger as a regional force?  Can we really expect ASEAN  to\r\n\r\nattain its original unity, to retain its original force as an\r\n\r\ninternational organisation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, would Singapore be better off in terms of geo-political strategy in charting its own course, eg,\r\n\r\nnegotiating our bilateral FTAs rather than waiting for  ASEAN\r\n\r\ninitiative  to take place, which as we have seen do  take  an\r\n\r\ninordinate  amount  of  time  for  such  agreements   to   be\r\n\r\ninitiated,  although I am very pleased to hear, I  must  say,\r\n\r\nthat  there is every possibility that there will be an ASEAN-China FTA by the end of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, if we are committed to ASEAN, how can we\r\n\r\nimprove internal strength, the internal unity of ASEAN?  Now,\r\n\r\nI   understand  that  among  the  officials  and  among   the\r\n\r\ngovernments, there is actually a very great sense  of  common\r\n\r\npurpose.   However, this does not translate to very  much  in\r\n\r\nterms of the other sectors, particularly the business and the\r\n\r\npeople sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at ASEAN, actually one of the greatest\r\n\r\nstrengths  in  ASEAN  is the diversity  of  its  people,  the\r\n\r\ndiversity of cultures.  And I think it is very important that\r\n\r\nif  we  have any long term interest in ASEAN we should expand\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of our engagement with ASEAN nations and  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  various Ministries, with the Ministry  of  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs  taking the primary role, encourage the expansion  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  especially in relation to  cultural  activities,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  think  that is one of the greatest  strengths  of\r\n\r\nASEAN.  It has been ignored, but it is a strength and  if  we\r\n\r\ncan    pull   the   500   million   people   together,   then\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding what my colleague, Mr Sin Boon Ann, has  said\r\n\r\nabout us not having a great GDP significance in the world, we\r\n\r\nnevertheless can still remain a powerful regional force.  500\r\n\r\nmillion people cannot always be wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, judging by what other Members\r\n\r\nhave  said,  ASEAN appears to have lost much of  its  lustre.\r\n\r\nSome 35 years after its founding, several\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmember  countries  are beset with political  and/or  economic\r\n\r\nproblems.   And quite a few are still dealing with the  fall-out  from  the  Asian financial crisis of 1997, reluctant  as\r\n\r\nthey  are even to deal with obvious root causes such as inept\r\n\r\npolitical   leadership,   corruption   and   poor   corporate\r\n\r\ngovernance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the admission of the CLMV countries, Cambodia,\r\n\r\nLaos,  Myanmar  and Vietnam, in recent years  threw  up  even\r\n\r\ngreater  disparities  in  the level of  social  and  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in  the  membership.   And  with   that,   vast\r\n\r\ndifferences  in  the  approaches  to  different  issues  that\r\n\r\nconfront  the  grouping  became  even  more  obvious.    Sir,\r\n\r\napproach to trade is one such example.  On the one end of the\r\n\r\nscale  you have Singapore, advocate of free markets and  free\r\n\r\ntrade,  and,  on the other end, you have the CLMV  countries,\r\n\r\nstill   far   from  comfortable  with  trade  liberalisation.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in between, you get Malaysia, committed to an ASEAN\r\n\r\nFree  Trade  Area  but still asking for  protection  for  its\r\n\r\nmotorcar industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with such disparity, I think it is difficult to\r\n\r\neven  pretend  that we can find strength in  diversity.   The\r\n\r\ndanger  is  that  ASEAN risks being marginalised  by  others.\r\n\r\nASEAN countries offer a combined market of about half that of\r\n\r\nChina's  1.2  billion  people and yet we  get  so  much  less\r\n\r\nattention  from others.  Large chunks of foreign  investments\r\n\r\nare bypassing the region, heading towards China and the North\r\n\r\nEast.   This is discomforting.  Sir, I have experienced  this\r\n\r\nuneasy  feeling myself when I visited the European Parliament\r\n\r\nlast  year.   The EU is very occupied with its own  problems,\r\n\r\nsuch  as enlarged membership.  And it has its priorities  and\r\n\r\nmust  be  selective  in its dealings with other  regions  and\r\n\r\ndecide  who  or what comes first on its radar  screen.   Sir,\r\n\r\nalthough  polite  noises are made that they  remain  occupied\r\n\r\nwith  an interest in South East Asia, there is no doubt  that\r\n\r\nChina  was  the focus of their dealings with Asia.   And  any\r\n\r\ninterest  in ASEAN was probably dominated by a pre-occupation\r\n\r\nwith what was happening in Myanmar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no less than the EU's Commissioner for External\r\n\r\nRelations,  Chris Patten, underscored this  when  he  visited\r\n\r\nSingapore  recently.  He said that Europe remained interested\r\n\r\nin  the  region.  Again it was a polite noise because in  the\r\n\r\nsame breath he said that EU-China ties were better and closer\r\n\r\nthan they had ever been before.  And he also pointed out that\r\n\r\nthe  level  of  European investments in this region  has  not\r\n\r\nrecovered  in  the  aftermath of the financial  crisis,  even\r\n\r\nafter five years.  And he reminded us that the attractiveness\r\n\r\nof  South  East  Asia to Europeans and other investors  would\r\n\r\ndiminish with the rise of opportunities in China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he also made the point about ASEAN's disparity and\r\n\r\npointing  to  the  different levels of wealth  in  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries, he said that, \"setting a clear and coherent policy\r\n\r\nfor  dealing  with that variety, is in itself  a  bit  of  an\r\n\r\nintellectual  Himalaya\".  Sir, these are ominous  words  from\r\n\r\nsomeone  who was the last British Governor of Hong  Kong  and\r\n\r\nwho  knows Asia well.  Or you can read between the  lines  to\r\n\r\ntake  that to mean that ASEAN had better get its act together\r\n\r\nor it is going to miss out altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how can ASEAN move forward? Sir, getting FTAs with\r\n\r\nother countries is an approach that we have taken and I think\r\n\r\nit  is  a good way.  The way Singapore has done in trying  to\r\n\r\nget  FTA  terms  with other countries has  put  paid  to  the\r\n\r\nargument  that we only think of our own interest  because  in\r\n\r\nthe  negotiations with the US we have roped in products  from\r\n\r\nBatam.   But my concern here is that this too appears  to  be\r\n\r\nstalling, now that the US President has failed to secure fast\r\n\r\ntrack authority from Congress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point that was raised was also the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement. I think my colleague made a\r\n\r\nmistake.   I do not think it is going to be signed  within  a\r\n\r\nyear.   From what I read, it is going to take some  10  years\r\n\r\nfor  such  an  FTA  to be in place and I think  10  years  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  a  long  time.  A lot of water would  have  passed\r\n\r\nunder the bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other point I want to make is that ASEAN\r\n\r\nappears  to  lack  leadership.  Significant  changes  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical   leadership   of  several   member   states   have\r\n\r\ncontributed to this vacuum.  Indonesia and Thailand  are  too\r\n\r\nbusy  trying  to  clean  up their own  backyards.   Sometimes\r\n\r\npeople ask me why Singapore cannot play a leading role.   But\r\n\r\nI  think, Sir, we have always said that we are small, we  are\r\n\r\npretty modest about this, and without naming names, I am sure\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  at least one or two others  who  would  not\r\n\r\naccept  us as the leader of ASEAN.  So we are modest  and  we\r\n\r\nsay  no.   We say that we rather get things going by  pushing\r\n\r\nfrom  behind.   Sir, I think that PM therefore got  it  right\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said that Singapore can play the role  of  a  path-finder.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan, start winding up your speech,\r\n\r\nplease.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Yes, Sir, just one minute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a path-finder is one who negotiates a route and\r\n\r\nkeeps  everyone on track.  I believe that unless  someone  is\r\n\r\nwilling  to clear the way, I am afraid that ASEAN  will  just\r\n\r\nhobble along like a lame old man and will have missed  a  lot\r\n\r\nof opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point I want to make is the question of\r\n\r\nterrorism which has been raised.  It is now a problem.  Where\r\n\r\nthe question that used to be asked was, \"Is this a good place\r\n\r\nto  invest?\", the question now being asked more often is, \"Is\r\n\r\nthis a safe place?\"  Sir, Prime Minister Mahathir himself has\r\n\r\nadmitted  as much that he has a problem dealing with  Islamic\r\n\r\nmilitants and the terrorist organisation Al Qaeda is known to\r\n\r\nhave  links with Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia and other groups\r\n\r\nsuch  as Laskar Jihad in Indonesia and the Abu-Sayaff in  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is: now that Indonesia, Malaysia and\r\n\r\nthe  Philippines have last week signed an anti-terrorism pact\r\n\r\nand  Thailand is reported to have been invited  to  join  the\r\n\r\npact,  I  would like to know why Singapore has been left  out\r\n\r\nand  whether we intend to sign on as a demonstration  of  our\r\n\r\ncommitment against the war on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterrorism.

That was the statement in the press.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Members who have spoken. Let\r\n\r\nme  respond  to, first, Dr Ong Chit Chung, on  the  strategic\r\n\r\noverview, and then the various comments on ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I agree, almost completely, with what Dr Ong Chit\r\n\r\nChung has said in his overview of the strategic situation.  I\r\n\r\nthink  he  has  put  it  as comprehensively  as  any  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister could.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I had noted that South East Asia was going\r\n\r\nthrough  very uncertain times and the situation not only  has\r\n\r\nnot   changed  materially,  but  the  terrorist  attacks   of\r\n\r\nSeptember   11   have  really  added  considerably   to   the\r\n\r\ncomplexities.   He  is  right  when  he  describes  it  as  a\r\n\r\nwatershed  year.  In my view, the September  11  events  have\r\n\r\naffected  the  geo-political  and  strategic  environment  in\r\n\r\nseveral ways.  I would mention at least three ways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the attacks and the United States' response to\r\n\r\nthem have underscored the United States' pre-eminence, and in\r\n\r\na  sense,  has  provided a focus for it.  The  anti-terrorism\r\n\r\ncampaign will now clearly be the main focus of United States'\r\n\r\npriority for the foreseeable future.  Washington, as  we  all\r\n\r\nknow,  is quietly determining who its friends and allies  are\r\n\r\nin this new situation.  The results of its determination will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  a  critical  influence  on East  Asia's  development  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about our relations with the\r\n\r\nUnited States and also about an assessment of our position on\r\n\r\ncounter-terrorism.  I think Members will know  that  we  have\r\n\r\ntaken  a  very  strong  stand on terrorism,  like  all  other\r\n\r\ncountries in East Asia.  Singapore has stood with the  United\r\n\r\nStates  in its global fight against terrorism.  Why?  Because\r\n\r\nit  is the right and correct thing to do.  As the arrests  of\r\n\r\nthe  Jemaah  Islamiyah and the uncovering of the  network  in\r\n\r\nSingapore have shown, we are clearly not immune.  And it is a\r\n\r\nfight  that all states in the world have to take a  stand  to\r\n\r\ncombat this new menace.\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way in which the global situation has changed\r\n\r\nis  that the events of September 11 have, in fact, stabilised\r\n\r\nUnited  States-China relations, a point  which  Dr  Ong  also\r\n\r\nreferred to, and that is a very important factor in the  East\r\n\r\nAsian  strategic  equation.  The terrorist  attacks  and  the\r\n\r\nfight against terrorism have affected big power relationships\r\n\r\nsignificantly.  As Dr Ong mentioned, the United States  needs\r\n\r\nChina's   support  for  its  global  anti-terrorism  efforts.\r\n\r\nAlthough  China  may  not agree fully with  every  aspect  of\r\n\r\nUnited States' policies, it also wants stable relations  with\r\n\r\nthe  United States.   When United States-China relations  are\r\n\r\nstable,  it  has  a calming effect on the region  across  the\r\n\r\nboard.  But when United States-China relations are disturbed,\r\n\r\nas  the  collision of the planes incident last April  showed,\r\n\r\nthe entire region is considerably unsettled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can expect the geo-political positioning to\r\n\r\ncontinue  in  many  different  forms.   There  may   be   the\r\n\r\noccasional   differences,  but  it  is  inevitable   in   the\r\n\r\nrelationship between big powers.  For now, the US-China-Japan\r\n\r\nstrategic triangular relationship which underpins East  Asian\r\n\r\ngrowth and prosperity can be described as stable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fortunate, in Singapore, to have very good\r\n\r\nrelations  with  China and Japan as well as with  the  United\r\n\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore and other countries in the region will benefit from\r\n\r\nthe strategic stability of US-China-Japan relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked specifically about our relationship with\r\n\r\nthe  United  States.   I would describe the  relationship  as\r\n\r\nexcellent.  It is multi-faceted.  It is a relationship  which\r\n\r\nis  a  strong one that pre-dates the events of September  11.\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Goh made a very successful visit to Washington\r\n\r\nlast  June and, more recently, Senior Minister did  so.   The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  and Senior Minister met President  Bush  and\r\n\r\nother  United  States  leaders, and they  had  very  fruitful\r\n\r\nexchange of views on both regional and bilateral matters.   I\r\n\r\nthink many other Ministers have also had visits to the United\r\n\r\nStates, or are planning to do so.  This close relationship is\r\n\r\nin  our  interest and, as several colleagues have  mentioned,\r\n\r\nboth on this Ministry and other cuts, the negotiations on FTA\r\n\r\nwith  the  United  States  will benefit,  not  just  our  two\r\n\r\ncountries,  but also the entire region.  When completed,  the\r\n\r\nFTA will strengthen the bilateral relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third way in which September 11 has affected the\r\n\r\nstrategic  landscape is that, as I had mentioned  last  year,\r\n\r\nthe political and economic changes that have catalysed across\r\n\r\nthe  region  by the crises of 1997 and 1998 are  still  being\r\n\r\nplayed out, and many countries are adjusting to those events.\r\n\r\nMatters are compounded  by the events of September 11.  A key\r\n\r\nfactor  will be how countries deal with political  Islam  and\r\n\r\nreligious  extremism, again a point which Dr  Ong  mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere  are  more than 230 million Muslims in Southeast  Asia.\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asian Islam has traditionally been  syncretic  and\r\n\r\ntolerant.   Mainstream Muslims in Southeast  Asia  have  been\r\n\r\nmoderate in their beliefs.  We all know that most Muslims  in\r\n\r\nour  region  want nothing to do with terrorism or  extremism.\r\n\r\nBut  it  is a fact that in Southeast Asia, Islam is  changing\r\n\r\nunder  pressure.  Why?  Pressure of external influences.   As\r\n\r\nDr Ong said, there are extremists with political agendas, and\r\n\r\nsome  of  the most dangerous terrorist organisations  try  to\r\n\r\ninvoke Islam as their motivating ideology. Muslim anger in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  quarters against the United States is another  fact  of\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, America's pre-eminence means that there is no\r\n\r\nreal  alternative for any Southeast Asian government than  to\r\n\r\ntry  to  forge  good relations with the United  States.  Good\r\n\r\nrelations  with  the  United States are not  possible  unless\r\n\r\ngovernments  cooperate in the anti-terrorism  campaign.   But\r\n\r\nmany  Southeast Asian governments will also have to find ways\r\n\r\nto  assuage the anxieties of their Muslim ground which may be\r\n\r\nuneasy or unhappy with the United States' policies, while  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time  taking  firm action to neutralise  extremist\r\n\r\nIslamic elements in their societies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How governments are going to deal with this matter is a\r\n\r\nreal  political conundrum.  How they are going to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthis will have a profound influence on Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked how is Singapore going to\r\n\r\nposition  itself on many of these fast-changing developments.\r\n\r\nAs  a  small  state, we do not have that many  options.   But\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as  we  all know, cannot exist without  effective\r\n\r\nlinks  to all parts of the world.  At the same time, we  must\r\n\r\nrealise  that Singapore's future is inextricably linked  with\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia.  That is why I have always stressed  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse that we will have to have a multi-track approach to our\r\n\r\nengagement  with  the  rest  of the  world.   We  are  firmly\r\n\r\ncommitted  and  must remain committed to  ASEAN  and  to  the\r\n\r\nregion.   And,  as I will show, when answering  questions  on\r\n\r\nASEAN,  we have, in fact, played our part in trying to assist\r\n\r\nASEAN  to deal with some of the enormous challenges  that  it\r\n\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have to engage with regions beyond\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia, with the major powers, with Europe, with  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States, and with North East Asia.  In doing  so,  not\r\n\r\nonly  do we advance our own interests but, I believe, it also\r\n\r\nhelps  focus  these  external players on  the  importance  of\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia.  Of course, specific policies will have to be\r\n\r\nadapted to changing circumstances.  I may add\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  total effect of  September 11 events is that  they\r\n\r\nhave     really    underscored   the   unpredictability    of\r\n\r\ninternational developments, and have underscored the need for\r\n\r\na small country like Singapore to be agile and nimble, and to\r\n\r\nadjust  both its economic, strategic and other facets of  its\r\n\r\npolicies to rapidly changing external environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those general remarks, let me turn to the specific\r\n\r\ncomments  my colleagues have made about ASEAN.  I  discern  a\r\n\r\ncommon  theme  or  concern in many  of  the  points  made  by\r\n\r\nMembers, which is a concern as to where ASEAN is heading.  Is\r\n\r\nit  in decline?  Does ASEAN have a future?  Can it have a new\r\n\r\nlease  of life?  What has Singapore done?  What can Singapore\r\n\r\ndo in this re-engineering or remaking of ASEAN?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we answer these questions? I would start, first,\r\n\r\nby  recalling  what I said last year, and that  is  ASEAN  is\r\n\r\ngoing  through  a very difficult period, largely  because  of\r\n\r\nboth internal and external challenges.  When I outlined those\r\n\r\nchallenges  last year, I was being frank and realistic.   But\r\n\r\nmuch  of  what  I have said still continues,  but  made  more\r\n\r\ncomplex  by  the events of September 11 and by the uncovering\r\n\r\nof terrorist networks in several places in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commentators continue to write articles about ASEAN\r\n\r\nwhich give a dismal picture and rather pessimistic prognosis.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be  misleading of me to paint an  overly  rosy  and\r\n\r\nupbeat  picture of ASEAN.  But at the same time, let  us  not\r\n\r\nhave  these  commentaries on ASEAN cause  us  to  prematurely\r\n\r\nwrite the orbituary of ASEAN, because I think one must take a\r\n\r\nrealistic  position.   If you ask me what  is  the  realistic\r\n\r\nposition,   it  is  that  while  ASEAN  faces  many   serious\r\n\r\nchallenges,  I think there are some grounds for optimism.   I\r\n\r\nwould  not  lose all hope and I think ASEAN can overcome  its\r\n\r\nchallenges,  provided, firstly, it gets its acts together  on\r\n\r\nthe internal challenges; secondly, provided it stays on track\r\n\r\non  some  of  the initiatives which have been launched;  and,\r\n\r\nthirdly, if it continues to be outward looking and not inward\r\n\r\nlooking.  I will elaborate on this shortly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that there are internal and external challenges.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the  Members  have alluded to  them.   On  internal\r\n\r\nchallenges, it covers points Mr Tan Soo Khoon and others have\r\n\r\nmentioned.   Many countries in ASEAN underwent or  are  still\r\n\r\nundergoing internal political transitional challenges.   Some\r\n\r\nare   undergoing  economic  challenges.   And   until   these\r\n\r\ncountries  are able to effectively overcome these challenges,\r\n\r\nit  is very difficult for them to pay attention to the bigger\r\n\r\npicture  of  regional solidarity and big picture  imperatives\r\n\r\nfor ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, every country in ASEAN must get its own act\r\n\r\ntogether -  economic, political.  Then the group, as a group,\r\n\r\nhas   to  overcome  some  of  the  challenges  mentioned   by\r\n\r\ncolleagues, namely, that of integration, how not to allow the\r\n\r\nrecent  expansion from 7 to 10  to become an unwieldy gorilla\r\n\r\nor  elephant,  and  not to let decision making  processes  be\r\n\r\nseverely circumscribed.  These are internal challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the political side, reference was made to Myanmar. I\r\n\r\nwas asked for an assessment.  I think it is too early to make\r\n\r\na  full assessment.  Singapore has welcomed the recent events\r\n\r\nin  Myanmar concerning the release of Aung San Suu  Kyi  from\r\n\r\nhouse  arrest  as  a  positive step in the  overall  national\r\n\r\nreconciliation process.  How it will proceed, I think we will\r\n\r\nhave  to  wait  and  see.  I think much will  depend  on  the\r\n\r\ndiscussions  between the SPDC and Aung San Suu  Kyi  herself.\r\n\r\nWe  do  not  know what exactly transpired in the confidential\r\n\r\ntalks, but there have been signs that a certain comfort level\r\n\r\nhas been reached.  Indeed, it is a positive step because,  as\r\n\r\nMr  Tan  Soo  Khoon  and others have said, the  situation  in\r\n\r\nMyanmar  previously has, in a sense, been a factor which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  responsible for some slowdown in our relationship  with\r\n\r\ndialogue  partners, particularly with the EU.   So  it  is  a\r\n\r\npositive  step  and  let us hope that it will  lead  to  more\r\n\r\npositive developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members talked about the expansion of ASEAN to\r\n\r\n10.   We  cannot  turn  the  clock  back.   There  were  good\r\n\r\nstrategic reasons why ASEAN took the decision to embrace  the\r\n\r\nnew members,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  expanding the organisation from 7 to 10.   As  with  all\r\n\r\norganisations, when membership increases, it must  inevitably\r\n\r\nbring  problems for consensus making, decision making and  so\r\n\r\non.   But the challenge in that regard is how to address  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  a  two-tier ASEAN.  This is a real problem,  and\r\n\r\nASEAN  has  to  address it, and Singapore, in  a  sense,  has\r\n\r\ncontributed  to  efforts towards integration  of  ASEAN.   An\r\n\r\nexample  is  Prime Minister Goh's proposal for the Initiative\r\n\r\nfor  ASEAN  Integration,  which was  endorsed  by  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nSummit.  To give concrete support to this, Singapore had,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  pledged  and given contributions to  the  Indo-Chinese\r\n\r\ncountries, including setting up of training centres there.\r\n\r\n<br>3.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;East Timor - it has not made a formal application for\r\n\r\nmembership.  I think the sense in ASEAN, as I discern it,  is\r\n\r\nto concentrate on consolidation of the existing ASEAN 10.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  we will proceed cautiously and take matters step  by\r\n\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure Prof. Chin Tet Yung is being completely\r\n\r\nfair  to  ASEAN when he said that ASEAN is focused purely  at\r\n\r\nthe  government  level.  Yes, much of ASEAN's  activities  is\r\n\r\ndriven by Foreign Affairs Ministries, Economic Ministers  and\r\n\r\na  whole host of other Ministries.  But he will be aware that\r\n\r\nthere  is  also  a  track two process in ASEAN.   The  former\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Mr Tan Soo Khoon, has been a very important  driver\r\n\r\nof  ASEAN  parliamentary meetings, for example, although  you\r\n\r\nmay  describe  that as non-governmental.  But Prof.  Chin  is\r\n\r\nright  that for ASEAN, we have to work not only at  the  pure\r\n\r\ngovernment instrument but at all other levels.  And there  is\r\n\r\na   host   of  organisations  -  professional  organisations,\r\n\r\nbusiness  organisations, which are ASEAN oriented,  including\r\n\r\nASEAN  business councils, and so on.   So, I agree with  him,\r\n\r\nbut these activities are being conducted.  His point that  we\r\n\r\nshould   also   have   people-to-people  linkages,   cultural\r\n\r\norganisations, is something that I would agree with,  and  we\r\n\r\nshould pursue that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards external challenges of ASEAN, Members have\r\n\r\nalluded  to it.  Principally, it is coping with the challenge\r\n\r\nof  China and North Asia.  Minister George Yeo, my colleague,\r\n\r\nI believe, has spoken about these challenges.  These are real\r\n\r\nchallenges.   And ASEAN, if it does not get its internal  and\r\n\r\nexternal acts together, may see a hollowing out as more  FDIs\r\n\r\nwill gravitate towards North Asia and China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asked about terrorism by several Members. Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  what transpired at the ASEAN Summit last year,  and  it\r\n\r\nwas  an  important development, before the uncovering of  the\r\n\r\nterrorist  networks in our region, the ASEAN leaders  took  a\r\n\r\nstand  when they adopted the Declaration on Terrorism,  which\r\n\r\nwas  not  just repeating the mantra, or motherhood statements\r\n\r\nabout  combating  terrorism, they asked for  law  enforcement\r\n\r\nagencies  in ASEAN to cooperate, particularly front-line  law\r\n\r\nenforcement  agencies.   In  a sense,  the  meeting  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  or Interior Ministers, which is going to take  place\r\n\r\nsoon  in Kuala Lumpur, I think, within the next two weeks  or\r\n\r\nso,  is  a very good follow-up of that.  Ms Irene Ng referred\r\n\r\nto  that meeting.  Exactly what is going to emerge from  that\r\n\r\nmeeting remains to be seen, but I am sure there is an earnest\r\n\r\ndesire  on the part of the law enforcement agencies  and  the\r\n\r\nMinisters who were charged with security to map out areas  in\r\n\r\nwhich  they  can cooperate.  This is absolutely essential  in\r\n\r\nview of the events which have arisen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tan Soo Khoon asked about this Trilateral Agreement.\r\n\r\nLet me just explain that the evolution or the genesis of this\r\n\r\nAgreement  was originally started when Philippines,  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  Indonesia drafted the agreement, and the text that I saw\r\n\r\nhad   a   specific   geographically   demarcated   area   for\r\n\r\ncooperation,  by  reference  to  coordinates.   Because,   as\r\n\r\nForeign  Minister Syed Hamid told the press  recently,  there\r\n\r\nwas  urgency felt among those three countries for cooperating\r\n\r\nin  the seas, Sulu Sea and seas off Celebes, and other areas,\r\n\r\nwhich  were  immediately adjacent to the country,  to  tackle\r\n\r\nspecific  problems.  That was my understanding  of  how  this\r\n\r\nAgreement came about.  The latest Agreement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been signed by the three countries.  It is not the  case\r\n\r\nof Singapore or other ASEAN countries being deliberately left\r\n\r\nout because the Malaysian Foreign Minister explained that  it\r\n\r\nwas  a  sense of urgency of these three countries which  felt\r\n\r\nthey  should proceed immediately on the areas of cooperation.\r\n\r\nNow,  we  have had to study the Agreement to see what aspects\r\n\r\nare contained there, and whether it has relevance for us and,\r\n\r\nif so, whether we should sign on, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the important point is this - for combating\r\n\r\nterrorism,  it has to be tackled by a variety of  ways,  both\r\n\r\nnationally, where countries have to take the necessary steps.\r\n\r\nOn  bilateral  cooperation, as we  know,  after  the  JI  was\r\n\r\nexposed,  we  have  excellent cooperation with  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nother  countries.  Whether it is trilateral  or  multilateral\r\n\r\nlike  the  UN, many fronts have to converge in tackling  this\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the external side, the key element is for ASEAN to be\r\n\r\noutward  looking.   Because, as  I  said,  if  it  is  inward\r\n\r\nlooking,  I  think the rest of the world will pass  ASEAN  by\r\n\r\nnow.   To be outward looking, it must continuously find  ways\r\n\r\nof  engaging with the external players, the dialogue partners\r\n\r\nand major powers, a point which Mr Ravindran also alluded to.\r\n\r\nASEAN  has  to, in a sense, rebuild its strategic  relevance.\r\n\r\nIf  you look back, countries were interested in ASEAN because\r\n\r\nASEAN  started  the ASEAN Regional Forum, the  only  security\r\n\r\nforum  of  its  type  in the region, and  ASEAN  was  in  the\r\n\r\ndriver's seat.  ASEAN is still in the driver's seat.  But  to\r\n\r\nbe in the driver's seat and to attract confidence and inspire\r\n\r\na  sense  of  support for ASEAN being in the  driver's  seat,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  driver's seat for ARF or  ASEAN  Plus-3,  ASEAN\r\n\r\nitself must be a credible organisation.  ASEAN has taken some\r\n\r\nsteps   which  show  that  it  realises  the  importance   of\r\n\r\nmaintaining its strategic relevance, for example, the  ASEAN-China  FTA.  Minister George Yeo may have spoken - I was  not\r\n\r\nin  the  Chamber - about the significance of this.   But  the\r\n\r\nsignificance  of  this is not just in the  economic  benefits\r\n\r\nthat  may  accrue to ASEAN or China, but it has  a  strategic\r\n\r\nrelevance, in a sense, that it will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunderscore to other countries the importance of ASEAN.  In  a\r\n\r\nsense,  this  has  been  borne out  because  soon  after  the\r\n\r\nannouncement  of ASEAN-China FTA, you would note  that  Japan\r\n\r\ntook   an  interest  and  has  offered  Japan-ASEAN  enhanced\r\n\r\neconomic cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a good sign. In this regard, Singapore's role\r\n\r\nis   quite  evident  because  the  Japanese  have,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nsuggested to the ASEAN countries to have a look at the Japan-Singapore  FTA as a model and to examine what provisions  may\r\n\r\nbe  applicable,  as  they discussed the ASEAN-Japan  economic\r\n\r\npartnership.  When we have this bilateral FTA, a  point  made\r\n\r\nby  Ms Irene Ng, it has spin-off effects for the rest of  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another sign that ASEAN realised its importance of being\r\n\r\noutward  looking is that it has now decided to have a  summit\r\n\r\nmeeting  with India, which is a proposal that Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nGoh  had floated some one or two years ago, and this has  now\r\n\r\nborne  fruits.   It is important to bring India  into  closer\r\n\r\ninteraction with ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are steps - Members may think that they are too\r\n\r\ntentative  and not enough - to show that ASEAN,  despite  all\r\n\r\nits problems, is aware of the importance of staying on track,\r\n\r\nthe  importance of continuing to be relevant to the  external\r\n\r\nplayers.  I should add that in July, there will be a  further\r\n\r\nengagement with the external players when the ASEAN  Regional\r\n\r\nForum  meets.   And I think when they meet in  Brunei,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  another opportunity for ASEAN to show that  working\r\n\r\nwith the dialogue partners, it can take several steps towards\r\n\r\ndiscussion in a concrete manner of the matters like combating\r\n\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked what can Singapore do, what\r\n\r\ncan  Singapore assist in showing leadership of ASEAN.  Mr Tan\r\n\r\nSoo Khoon referred to the pathfinder role.  Whatever term you\r\n\r\ndescribe - whether it is pathfinder or leading from behind  - Singapore's  commitment to ASEAN is there.  It  is  important\r\n\r\nfor us.  It is in our interest that ASEAN succeeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have referred to some of the roles we have played. It\r\n\r\nwas  Prime Minister Goh who proposed that ASEAN invite  India\r\n\r\nfor  a  summit.   This has now borne fruits.  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nGoh,   in   Singapore,  proposed  an  Initiative  for   ASEAN\r\n\r\nIntegration.   And  we  have, in  fact,  set  an  example  by\r\n\r\nproviding some $50 million over a 5-year period, and training\r\n\r\ncentres  have actually been set up in Indo-Chinese countries.\r\n\r\nWe  have  also  come out with ideas as to how  ASEAN  can  be\r\n\r\nmarketed  abroad, and the idea of roadshows - ASEAN Roadshows\r\n\r\n- in fact was proposed by Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the political and security side, it was\r\n\r\nSingapore  which  suggested that ASEAN also  has  closed-door\r\n\r\nretreats.   Why?   Because  there is  a  tendency  in  ASEAN,\r\n\r\nbecause  of the ASEAN way of doing things, to tread  gingerly\r\n\r\non  sensitive and delicate topics.  So what we have  decided,\r\n\r\nand  also  it  was  Singapore's proposal,  was  in  order  to\r\n\r\novercome  this, let us have retreats where only  the  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters,  unaccompanied  by  officials,  meet.   This   has\r\n\r\nenabled, over a few years, ASEAN Foreign Ministers to discuss\r\n\r\nmatters in a very frank and candid way.  I would say, on some\r\n\r\noccasions,  topics which in previous years  would  have  been\r\n\r\nconsidered sensitive and too delicate to be brought up  among\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers, Singapore has also suggested the proposal for\r\n\r\ne-ASEAN, which has been taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, how ASEAN will move, whether it moves\r\n\r\nsuccessfully   or   whether  it  will   be   a   marginalised\r\n\r\norganisation, depends on these twin challenges -  whether  we\r\n\r\ncan  overcome  the  internal challenges and  whether  we  can\r\n\r\novercome  the  external challenges of being outward  looking,\r\n\r\nand  continue to be regarded by major powers and the dialogue\r\n\r\npartners as a body with whom they find it useful and relevant\r\n\r\nto stay engaged with.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

It  zooms\r\n\r\nup  and  down,  up and down, full of excitement and  thrills.\r\n\r\nNever  a  dull moment, I must say.  But, Sir, it is not  good\r\n\r\nfor  the  heart, not good for the heart of economic interests\r\n\r\nand not good for the heartlanders of both countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should all forget the past historical baggage of\r\n\r\nmerger and separation and focus on the present business of  a\r\n\r\nborderless  new economy.  In this regard, Singapore  believes\r\n\r\nfirmly  in the \"prosper thy neighbour\" policy.  But recently,\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, was  reported  to\r\n\r\nhave  said  that \"there are many ways to skin a cat,  and  to\r\n\r\nskin  Singapore, there are also many ways\".  This is  a  most\r\n\r\nunfriendly  comment from the Prime Minister of a neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remind the Malaysians that Singapore is no pussy\r\n\r\ncat.   We are no pushover.  They should jolly well know  that\r\n\r\nit  is not easy to skin a lion.  And those who dare try  will\r\n\r\nbe badly mauled.  So better do not try.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this we can promise. The lions of Singapore will\r\n\r\nstand  up  and roar and defend Singapore, our homeland.   Are\r\n\r\nall  these Singapore bashings a preparation or prelude to the\r\n\r\ncoming  Malaysian election?  I wonder.  But we  welcome  fair\r\n\r\ncompetition, whether from Port Tanjung\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPelepas, or KL International Airport, as long as it  is  done\r\n\r\non  a commercial basis.  In this regard, there is no need for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  moan  and groan.  No  need  to  generate  a\r\n\r\nclimate  of  gloom and doom.  Such competition  helps  us  to\r\n\r\nsharpen  our  competitiveness and enhance  our  productivity.\r\n\r\nThis  is  part and parcel of life.  We need not be  angry  or\r\n\r\nresent   such   competition  but  welcome  such   competition\r\n\r\npositively.    It  makes  us  better.   It  makes   us   more\r\n\r\ncompetitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, earlier on in this House, BG George Yeo\r\n\r\npointed  out that our economic competitors are not only  from\r\n\r\nthe region, but from further afield, from China, for example.\r\n\r\nAnd  its cost-efficient manufacturing capacities in China  is\r\n\r\none  important  area for us to look at.   So  we  must  thank\r\n\r\nMalaysia for giving us, indeed, a practice run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, water has been a bone of contention between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaysia.  Singapore is indeed  deemed  to  be\r\n\r\ndependent on Malaysia for water and could be held to  ransom.\r\n\r\nOn  the day of Separation, Tungku Abdul Rahman said that, \"If\r\n\r\nSingapore's  foreign  policy  is  prejudicial  to  Malaysia's\r\n\r\ninterests, we could always bring pressure to bear on them  by\r\n\r\nthreatening  to  turn  off the water  in  Johor.\"   And  this\r\n\r\nMalaysian position has not changed over the years.   Now  and\r\n\r\nthen, Malaysians have threatened to use water as a trump card\r\n\r\nagainst Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Analysts and commentators have pointed out that this\r\n\r\ncould  lead to tension and open conflict.  Even Mr Chiam  See\r\n\r\nTong, speaking in this House on 5th June 1997, declared  that\r\n\r\n\"cutting off the water supply is a very serious issue.  It is\r\n\r\nlike  declaring  war  on Singapore.\"  Lt General  Zaini  Mohd\r\n\r\nSaid,  a  retired Malaysian General, wrote that water  was  a\r\n\r\nsecurity issue that could lead to war.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the situation has changed. The first to pick this\r\n\r\nup  amongst  analysts is Mr Joey Long, a young researcher  at\r\n\r\nthe  NTU Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies.  Mr Long\r\n\r\nwrote  a  ground-breaking article on the water issue  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia in the December\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2001  issue of \"Contemporary Southeast Asia\", a journal.   Mr\r\n\r\nLong  concludes that with the desalination and  NEWater  from\r\n\r\nrecycling  plants, Singapore has the means to  achieve  water\r\n\r\nself-sufficiency  and  is  no  longer  held  to   ransom   by\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  use of water as a leverage.  In other words,  the\r\n\r\nwater  issue  has  been  desecuritised.  There  is  no   need\r\n\r\ntherefore   for   rhetoric  and   threats.    No   need   for\r\n\r\nconfrontation  and conflict.  There is no more the  Damocles'\r\n\r\nsword  hanging  over  our  heads.  Mr  Long  is  indeed  most\r\n\r\nperceptive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we remember that in this House on 5th April 2002,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister confirmed that Singapore  had  called  a\r\n\r\ntender  for  a  desalination plant and has been  operating  a\r\n\r\nplant to produce NEWater using membrane technology with  more\r\n\r\nNEWater  plants to be built in the future.  And the  cost  is\r\n\r\nindeed  not  prohibitive.  The Prime Minister concluded  that\r\n\r\n\"it may be better for bilateral relations if we start to move\r\n\r\na  little away from our reliance on Malaysia for water.\"  May\r\n\r\nI  ask  the Minister what is the reaction of Malaysia to  our\r\n\r\nnew  found self-sufficiency in water?  I also wish to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  to update us on the negotiations of the package  of\r\n\r\nissues  and  whether  the  talks  have  resumed  and  whether\r\n\r\nMalaysia has sent a comprehensive note on their claims on the\r\n\r\nissue of land reclamation and the basis of such claims.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  may also care to draw some lessons on this  roller-coaster   up-and-down  relationship  between  Singapore   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  put it in the context of history and  politics\r\n\r\nfor us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, relations with\r\n\r\nMalaysia  will  always  have its  ups  and  downs.   However,\r\n\r\nrecently,  there  are more downs than ups.   The  reasons,  I\r\n\r\nthink,   are,   one,  historical;  two,  increasing   intense\r\n\r\ncompetition as a result of Malaysia's strong economic  growth\r\n\r\nand  progress.   I  have no problems with  increased  intense\r\n\r\ncompetition because, to me, it is good for both countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has to sit up and accept such challenges to\r\n\r\nour  port  and  airport services with more vigour  than  ever\r\n\r\nbefore, and to compete with Malaysia for new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  talent  with our recent  tax  restructuring.\r\n\r\nThis  healthy competition will bring about better changes  to\r\n\r\nboth  economies.   In  fact, intense  competitive  activities\r\n\r\nattract  international players to come and take advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe  good deals that come out of these competitions.   So  we\r\n\r\nhave  Maersk  Lines  and  we  have  Evergreen  going  to  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  port,  Pelapas.  However,  if  historical  reasons\r\n\r\ncontinue to bear down on relations, then I think it is  going\r\n\r\nto be tough to resolve because of the strong emotive elements\r\n\r\nattached  to  this.   This should, however, be addressed  and\r\n\r\nleft  to rest once and for all in a pragmatic and non-emotive\r\n\r\nmanner.   Talks based on perception of issues will  create  a\r\n\r\nwidening gap between the two countries.  It must be based  on\r\n\r\nfacts  or it will not withstand the test of law, locally  and\r\n\r\ninternationally.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best signal came from Malaysian Foreign Minister\r\n\r\nSyed  Hamid Albar, when he played moderator and told some  of\r\n\r\nthe  country's brightest brains to discard historical baggage\r\n\r\nwhen   dealing   with  Singapore.   He  was  addressing   the\r\n\r\nAssociation of Young Malaysian Professionals recently in  KL.\r\n\r\nIn  his  address,  one of the questions  he  posed  was:  can\r\n\r\nemotions make way for pragmatism?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach to issues has always been pragmatic and, at\r\n\r\ntimes,  clinical, and this has probably irked many.  However,\r\n\r\nwe  were brought up in circumstances that gave us not much of\r\n\r\nan  option  but to work hard and survive.  Our EQ  is  poorly\r\n\r\nranked.   But  that does not mean we cannot  learn  from  the\r\n\r\nMalaysians  or  from the Thais on this art of making  friends\r\n\r\nand  winning people.  We want to be friends with  all.   Some\r\n\r\nhave  accused that Singapore is an Israel.  But Singapore  is\r\n\r\nnot the Israel of the East, and we do not want to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and Malaysia have many similarities than\r\n\r\ndifferences.   We  should avoid highlighting our  differences\r\n\r\nand  emphasise  on our similarities.  Both countries'  racial\r\n\r\nmix is the same, though in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferent proportions.  Both use Malay, Mandarin and English;\r\n\r\nboth  have relatives on each side of the Causeway;  and  both\r\n\r\nhave  investments on either side.  In fact, Singapore is  the\r\n\r\nbiggest  investor in Malaysia.  In fact, I remember,  when  I\r\n\r\nattended  many  of  these  parliamentary  meetings  with   my\r\n\r\nMalaysian  counterparts, I find Malaysians  and  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ngravitating towards each other during such meetings, and  the\r\n\r\njokes  we share, the songs we sing, and the stand we took  on\r\n\r\nmany  issues usually strike similar chords.  Many of the  two\r\n\r\ncountries' agencies work very closely together, such  as  the\r\n\r\npolice,   the  anti-narcotics  agencies,  tourism  and   even\r\n\r\nsecurity  matters, eg, the latest terrorist crackdown.   Yet,\r\n\r\nit  is  sad  when  I hear of harsh calls to  stop  our  water\r\n\r\nsupply, for example.  Perhaps, these were said in the heat of\r\n\r\nanger and not meant seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we can, for once, set aside all our\r\n\r\nhistorical  baggage, as proposed by their  Foreign  Minister,\r\n\r\nand negotiate all our outstanding issues purely on the merits\r\n\r\nof  the case, with a little give and take on both sides, then\r\n\r\nI  hope we can start a new chapter in our relations.  It will\r\n\r\nbe good for both countries, it will be good for our children.\r\n\r\nAnd  for  both  countries because the region will  be  viewed\r\n\r\ndifferently than today, with investors more assured of  their\r\n\r\nchoice to put their money in these two countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia is a beautiful country, notwithstanding\r\n\r\nwhat my colleague said that we do not visit Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Tan, could you pose your question\r\n\r\nquickly, because we are rather short of time now?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> I am saying that we should not just\r\n\r\ntake  these differences and these ups and downs that we  have\r\n\r\nwith  Malaysia  by  not going to visit Malaysia.   We  should\r\n\r\nvisit Malaysia, have more exchanges with each other, and then\r\n\r\nwe will have better trust between the two countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Sir, the negotiations on our\r\n\r\nbilateral package with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaysia  show  no sign of real progress.  On  the  contrary,\r\n\r\nthey  seem to have regressed.  In September 2000, when Senior\r\n\r\nMinister Lee Kuan Yew visited KL, there was hope of  a  deal.\r\n\r\nAn  in-principle agreement was reached in skeletal form, with\r\n\r\ndifferences narrowed significantly between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThis was despite the fact that Malaysia introduced new issues\r\n\r\nto the package, such as the building of an underground tunnel\r\n\r\nand a bridge, and the demolition of the Causeway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore had made concessions to reach the skeletal\r\n\r\nagreement,  such  as offering 12 parcels  of  land  in  Bukit\r\n\r\nTimah.   Many Singaporeans had then queried whether Singapore\r\n\r\nhad  given too much.  Then, instead of seizing the moment  to\r\n\r\nnarrow differences further, Malaysia suddenly upped the price\r\n\r\nof  water being negotiated many times, and everything is  now\r\n\r\nback  on  the  drawing  board.  Sir, in  most  parts  of  the\r\n\r\ncivilised  world, this would be considered a breach  of  good\r\n\r\nfaith.  Since then, heat was generated in the Malaysian media\r\n\r\nover  issues such as land reclamation, Pulau Pisang and Pedra\r\n\r\nBranca.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this does not help to improve the climate for\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  My concern is that Malaysia might use  any  of\r\n\r\nthese new issues to pressure us during our negotiations  over\r\n\r\nthe  bilateral package.  Indeed, can the Minister  assure  us\r\n\r\nthat no more new issues will be added to the already unwieldy\r\n\r\npackage?  And, since everything is so fluid now, it  is  also\r\n\r\nworth asking if it is wise for us to be even negotiating  the\r\n\r\nissues at all as a package.  It has so many issues tangled up\r\n\r\ntogether.  It is so unwieldy, and it seems to be so dependent\r\n\r\non the temperament of Malaysian leaders that I feel it cannot\r\n\r\nhold  together  as  a stable agreement,  even  after  it  was\r\n\r\nsigned.  After all, the Points of Agreement on railway  land,\r\n\r\nsigned  in  1990  between Senior Minister Lee  and  the  then\r\n\r\nMalaysian Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin, was supposed to be\r\n\r\nbinding.  Yet it had to be varied now to accommodate requests\r\n\r\nfrom Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, before any deal can be reached, confidence must\r\n\r\nbe built on both sides,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbased  on  mutual  respect and reciprocity.   But,  from  the\r\n\r\nbarrage of one-sided criticisms from across the Causeway,  my\r\n\r\nguess  is that it will take a long time - or, at least,  some\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Mahathir was reported as saying that the 1963\r\n\r\nwater  agreement with us was unfair to Malaysia  because  \"it\r\n\r\nstates  that  there can be no changes unless  both  countries\r\n\r\nagree.\"   This  statement worries me,  because  it  seems  to\r\n\r\nindicate  that  he prefers an agreement which can  be  broken\r\n\r\nunilaterally, then only it is fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important that our package deal with\r\n\r\nMalaysia, if it is at last made, be sealed so tightly that it\r\n\r\nwould  not  unravel just because someone wants to pick  fault\r\n\r\nwith  any one of the issues down the road, like a cat playing\r\n\r\nwith a ball of thread.  The future generations should not  be\r\n\r\nbequeathed with such extra historical baggage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a younger MP, my hope is that, when the\r\n\r\nagreement  is done, the younger generations of both countries\r\n\r\nare  able to view the agreement as a positive symbol  of  our\r\n\r\ninterlocking  destinies.  Then, we can move on and  build  on\r\n\r\nthis legacy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I agree with my colleague before\r\n\r\nme in his choice of the metaphor to describe our relationship\r\n\r\nwith the Malaysians, ie, it is like a roller-coaster, it  has\r\n\r\nits ups and it has its downs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last year, in this House, it was reported that our\r\n\r\nbilateral  ties  with  the Malaysians were  improving.   This\r\n\r\narises from Senior Minister Lee's visit to Malaysia, when  we\r\n\r\nthought  we  had  an  agreement in principle  to  settle  all\r\n\r\noutstanding  issues  with  a  certain  measure  of   urgency.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, after more than a year, it does not seem as if\r\n\r\nwe are anywhere closer to resolving these outstanding issues.\r\n\r\nNot only that, we have new issues emerging, such as the issue\r\n\r\non  our land reclamation works at the Singapore straits which\r\n\r\nis  now  a  bone  of  contention between the  two  countries.\r\n\r\nHonestly,  Sir,  I cannot see how the conduct  of  legitimate\r\n\r\nactivities  within our territorial waters can be seen  as  an\r\n\r\ninterference with the rights\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Malaysians.   My  understanding  is  that  the  land\r\n\r\nreclamation  is  well within the bounds of international  law\r\n\r\nand is within our legitimate right so to undertake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems that in recent months, it is not uncommon\r\n\r\nfor the Malaysian media to allow itself to be used as a forum\r\n\r\nto  conduct international relations.  The exploitation of the\r\n\r\nmedia  has caught the attention of a Straits Times cartoonist\r\n\r\nin  a  recent  publication, where there was a  cartoon  which\r\n\r\ndepicted the removal of the Merlion from one side of the road\r\n\r\nto  the other with a caption which said: \"Let's better  check\r\n\r\nwith  the Malaysian media before we move the Merlion  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether  they  approve of it.\"   We can  all  laugh  at  this\r\n\r\nlittle joke.  Unfortunately, it is a sad reflection of how we\r\n\r\nhave allowed our foreign relations with the Malaysians to  be\r\n\r\nplayed  out.   And,  as I was preparing  to  come  into  this\r\n\r\nChamber,  my  GPC Chairman, Dr Ong, remarked that  I  have  a\r\n\r\nsombre-looking tie and asked whether this reflected the  tone\r\n\r\nof  our relations with Malaysia.  Well, I thought perhaps  it\r\n\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have lost much ground in our ties with the\r\n\r\nMalaysians,  and this is evident by the Freudian  slip  which\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian Prime Minister made recently when he alluded to\r\n\r\nthe  fact that there are many ways to skin the Singapore cat.\r\n\r\nThe   Malaysians   have  called  for   sensitivity   in   our\r\n\r\nrelationship  with  them.  If, as in the case  of  our  ties,\r\n\r\nsensitivity   is  to  be  applied,  I  wonder  whether   this\r\n\r\nsensitivity should also be mutually applied.  Where, if I may\r\n\r\nask,  is  the  sensitivity when the Malaysian Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nalludes  to  the fact that there are many ways  to  skin  us?\r\n\r\nSuch words, unfortunately, and sadly, are not words that will\r\n\r\nhelp  strengthen  our bilateral ties.  On  the  contrary,  it\r\n\r\nweakens  and undermines the goodwill that we have put  in  so\r\n\r\nmuch effort to build up in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let it be known that Singaporeans expect the\r\n\r\nconduct  of our bilateral ties with the Malaysians to  be  on\r\n\r\nequal footing and between two sovereign states enjoying equal\r\n\r\nstatus and standing in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  international community.  If the Malaysians  think  that\r\n\r\nours is an \"abang-adek\" relationship, then I am sorry to  say\r\n\r\nthey  are sadly mistaken.  Again, I should have guessed  that\r\n\r\nperhaps the Malaysian general election is coming, and this is\r\n\r\nthe  usual  time of the year or the season to  take  out  the\r\n\r\nbogeyman from the cupboard to win popular support.   If  such\r\n\r\nwas the intention of the leaders, then one wonders how it  is\r\n\r\npossible  for  the outside world to have much admiration  for\r\n\r\ntheir system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, appreciate it if the Minister can\r\n\r\ngive  us  an update on the existing relationship between  the\r\n\r\ntwo countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, my parliamentary colleague, Dr Tan\r\n\r\nCheng Bock, is a very nice man, and he means very nice things\r\n\r\nfor  everybody.  Sir, I, like him, was very optimistic, being\r\n\r\na   young  generation  of  Singaporeans,  that  with  a   new\r\n\r\ngeneration on both sides of the Causeway, we will have a good\r\n\r\nrelationship in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, unfortunately, as a person who visits Malaysia\r\n\r\nregularly, the contrary is happening in Malaysia.  I remember\r\n\r\nSenior Minister Lee Kuan Yew made a call a few years ago that\r\n\r\nwe   do  not  pass  this  historical  baggage  to  the   next\r\n\r\ngeneration.   But,  if  one goes and  talks  to  the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration  in  Malaysia,  on  the  contrary,  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nleaders  keep  on  passing historical  baggage  and  keep  on\r\n\r\nraising  issues which predate historical matters.   I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether they sincerely want the new generation to start their\r\n\r\nrelationship  on  a  new  basis or  do  they  want  all  this\r\n\r\nhistorical baggage to be at the back of their mind when  they\r\n\r\ndeal with Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would add that let us be cautious but, at the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  try  to  keep an even keel  with  our  Malaysian\r\n\r\nfriends.   The cat was let out of the bag recently  when  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Prime  Minister told UMNO to get ready  for  early\r\n\r\nelections next year.  It explains the issues that were raised\r\n\r\nby  the  Malaysians  in the last few  months.   I  think  the\r\n\r\nstandard operating procedure for the next few months will see\r\n\r\nthe usual barrage of issues across the Causeway,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom  Pulau Pisang to reclamation, to water, so much so  that\r\n\r\nsomebody  even  remarked that they may  raise  goreng  pisang\r\n\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the latest salvo, which was fired just last week,\r\n\r\nwas  that  our  Malay  brothers  are  being  left  behind  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as compared to those up north.  I sincerely  hope\r\n\r\nthat  our  High  Commission in Malaysia  can  put  all  these\r\n\r\nbilateral  issues  on its website with detailed  answers,  so\r\n\r\nthat whenever these issues are raised by the Malaysian media,\r\n\r\nMalaysian  leaders  or  even ordinary  Malaysians,  our  High\r\n\r\nCommission  can  just send them a simple note  telling  them,\r\n\r\n\"Please refer to this particular page on our website on  this\r\n\r\nissue which has been raised many times in the past.\"  And,  I\r\n\r\nthink, by reminding them and telling them to keep on going to\r\n\r\nthe  website with those particular pages, we show  them  that\r\n\r\nthey  are,  basically, playing the same old broken gramophone\r\n\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what really perturbed me was the recent comment by\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian Prime Minister where he stated that just  like\r\n\r\nthere  are  many ways to skin a cat, there are many  ways  to\r\n\r\nskin  Singapore.   That  it was not a Freudian  slip,  but  a\r\n\r\ncareful   statement,  bothers  me  a  lot  and   many   other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, some of whom wrote to the press about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am heartened to see that there are many lions in\r\n\r\nthis  House, just like there are many other lions  out  there\r\n\r\nwho  will  stand  and show that there are many  varieties  of\r\n\r\ncats.  Do not always think that this is a kucing kurap.  This\r\n\r\nis  Singapura and, if you try to skin the wrong cat, you  may\r\n\r\nend up getting into a lot of trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while it is directed to the domestic audience, the\r\n\r\nimplications  of  the  statement  are  very  grave.   Do  the\r\n\r\nMalaysians have a grand plan to fix Singapore, which directly\r\n\r\nfixes  every Singaporean?  Is the grand plan to fix Singapore\r\n\r\nsupported  by all Malaysians?  If so, in what ways  are  they\r\n\r\nplanning to fix us?  I am sure that if a Singapore leader had\r\n\r\nmade a similar statement about Malaysia, they would have made\r\n\r\na ruckus about the statement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  even  gone to protest before our High Commission.

Singapore's  investments\r\n\r\nin Malaysia are only superseded by those of America.  America\r\n\r\nis  Malaysia's  largest  investor.  Malaysia  is  Singapore's\r\n\r\nlargest  trading partner.  Singapore is physically  connected\r\n\r\nto Malaysia by a Causeway.  Singapore depends on Malaysia for\r\n\r\nits water supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This water supply seems to be a troublesome issue. As\r\n\r\nreported by Dr Ong, an article published that if Singapore is\r\n\r\nself-sufficient in water, I suppose that much of the  quarrel\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore  and Malaysia will be taken  away,  but  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  even  if there were no water issue, because  of  our\r\n\r\nproximity  with  each  other, there shall  be  some  form  of\r\n\r\nquarrel from time to time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good relationship between Malaysia and Singapore is\r\n\r\nof paramount\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportance.  What is worrying is that these angry  words  can\r\n\r\nescalate.  This kind of situation has been going on  for  the\r\n\r\nlast  10  years.  It is not a recent event.   I  believe  the\r\n\r\nquarrels  between Singapore and Malaysia are there  for  more\r\n\r\nthan  10 years in fact.  Malaysia has complained of Singapore\r\n\r\nbeing  \"unneighbourliness'' and arrogant.  Some  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave  called  their fellow countrymen to boycott shopping  at\r\n\r\nJohor  Bahru  and to stop travelling to Malaysia.   It  would\r\n\r\nappear  that,  with  the  passage of time,  the  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and Malaysia has not improved.  In fact, it\r\n\r\nhas worsened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words of war have escalated and become quite intense\r\n\r\nrecently.   Last  month,  the  Malaysians  paper  the  Minggu\r\n\r\nMalaysia reported, \"Following the uproar over the reclamation\r\n\r\nof  land off Pulau Tekong, noises are being made about  going\r\n\r\nto  war  with Singapore.  This time, it is a small  group  of\r\n\r\nMalaysians who are beating the drums of war.\"  Then  I  quote\r\n\r\nagain, \"These people who do not have a complete understanding\r\n\r\nof  the  problems  at hand want the Government  to  stop  the\r\n\r\nsupply  of  water and take confrontational action.\"   It  was\r\n\r\nfurther  reported in that newspaper that,  \"It  was  an  open\r\n\r\nsecret  that  if  Malaysia cut off the water  supply  to  the\r\n\r\nRepublic,  Singapore would use its airforce to attack  Johor,\r\n\r\ntry  and  wrest  control of the water  treatment  plants  and\r\n\r\noccupy  that state.\"  These are very dangerous words -  going\r\n\r\nto war between the two countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What must we do? I would suggest that if Singapore is\r\n\r\nable  to  take  the  initiative  to  form  a  committee  with\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  both countries and  all  questions  of\r\n\r\nrelations between Singapore and Malaysia be brought  to  this\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  not dealt with by the press.  In  any  event,\r\n\r\nSir,  such words or talk between Singapore and Malaysia going\r\n\r\nto war must be stopped.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zainul Abidin. We are running behind\r\n\r\ntime now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, last week, there was a\r\n\r\ngroup from Malacca,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccompanied  by  the  members of the Malaysian  Institute  of\r\n\r\nHistorical  and Patriotism Studies, who came to visit  Malay-Muslim organisations and members of the community.  I  had  a\r\n\r\ndialogue with them too.  They came out saying that, in  fact,\r\n\r\nfrom  what they observed, they were very clear in their  mind\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore Malays are very much an integral part of  the\r\n\r\nsociety,  that  they have not been left  out  and  have  been\r\n\r\nlooked after, and there is no marginalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week earlier, Datuk Megat Najmuddim Khas, the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Corporate Governance Institute also said  on\r\n\r\nCNA  `Between  the Lines' to the effect that we  should  just\r\n\r\nforget  about  the  rhetorics  and  the  private  sectors  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and  Singapore should move on to improve  relations\r\n\r\nbetween the two countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should encourage more people-to-people\r\n\r\nrelations  to grow.  We should encourage more of the  Melaka-type  of  groups of people to come and similarly,  we  should\r\n\r\nreciprocate by sending our grassroots organisations groups to\r\n\r\nvisit Malaysia to promote better understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that the last time our Senior Minister\r\n\r\nvisited  Malaysia, he chose to travel by road just to impress\r\n\r\non  the  Malaysians that he is willing to come to  understand\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysians closer and better.  I think maybe it is about\r\n\r\ntime that Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, also\r\n\r\nmade  a  visit here and stayed close to the ground to have  a\r\n\r\nbetter understanding of Singapore.  I say this because of two\r\n\r\nremarks  which  Dr  Mahathir made:  one,  is  of  course  the\r\n\r\ninfamous  skinning of the cat, and the other is  his  remarks\r\n\r\nabout Singapore Malays.  I do not want to belabour the point,\r\n\r\nSir,  but I think I remember that sometime back, one  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  journalist once described Dr Mahathir as a \"top  dog\".\r\n\r\nThat  could  have evoked him to refer to us as a cat.   Never\r\n\r\nhad  we  in fact seen ourselves as a top cat.  So  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  there  is a need for them to skin us.  I  must  remind\r\n\r\nthem  that neither are we stray cats.  We are a very integral\r\n\r\npart  of  the  region  and we value good relations  with  our\r\n\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a cat of our own called Kuchinta, meaning\r\n\r\nwe  love  you.   This  is  just  to  remind  Malaysians  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  love  Singapore and we  will  defend  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhenever there are unfriendly and uncalled for remarks  made.\r\n\r\nDr Mahathir should realise that Singapore Malays do not agree\r\n\r\nwith his description of their position in Singapore.  Yes, we\r\n\r\nare  a minority. Yes, we still have problems to overcome  but\r\n\r\nwe  are  not  marginalised.  Neither do  we  despair  in  our\r\n\r\nefforts  to  uplift.   We  are  happy  that  our  efforts  at\r\n\r\nupliftment  not  only get the support of the  Government  but\r\n\r\nalso   support  from  the  private  sector.   By  all  means,\r\n\r\nMalaysian  leaders can motivate the Malaysian Malays  but  do\r\n\r\nnot  look  down on Singapore Malays.  They hurt the Singapore\r\n\r\nMalays'  feelings by those unfair remarks.  Let us move  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  `dogs and cats' relationship to one that  is  more\r\n\r\nproductive and more friendly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, compared with previous years, I\r\n\r\ncannot  recall the Committee of Supply where so many  Members\r\n\r\nhave  moved cuts on Malaysia. I think, this is, in fact,  the\r\n\r\nlargest number.  Perhaps it is understandable in view of what\r\n\r\nDr  Ong  Chit Chung had said about the ups and downs  in  our\r\n\r\nbilateral  relationship and the way in  which  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nbeen criticised in the Malaysian media on several issues over\r\n\r\nthe past few months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh recently, on 5th May 2002, spoke\r\n\r\nabout  the  negative  reports in the Malaysian  media.   They\r\n\r\nstarted with the water issue in January. We were portrayed as\r\n\r\nhaving  profiteered  from  the  purchase  of  water   at   an\r\n\r\n\"unreasonably\"  low  price all these years  as  a  result  of\r\n\r\n\"unfair\" Agreements, as mentioned by Ms Irene Ng.    Then  in\r\n\r\nFebruary,  their media turned to the tudung issue, with  some\r\n\r\nalleging  that  our policy was part of an overall  scheme  to\r\n\r\nmarginalise   the   Malay-Muslim  community   following   the\r\n\r\nSeptember 11 events and the arrest of the JI in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in late February, the focus moved on to Singapore's\r\n\r\nland  reclamation works.  In March, remarks which  have  been\r\n\r\nmade in jest by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan almost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthreatened  to become a self-contained bilateral  issue.   In\r\n\r\nApril,  criticism  turned  to  the  lighthouse  that  we  are\r\n\r\nentitled  to  operate on Pulau Pisang, with wild  allegations\r\n\r\nthat  armed  Singapore  personnel  were  going  there.   More\r\n\r\nrecently, Members would have read reports that Singapore  was\r\n\r\nbuying fewer tomatoes from Cameron Highlands, and accusations\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore was turning away Malaysian vegetables because\r\n\r\nthey  did  not satisfy certain health standards that  we  had\r\n\r\nsomehow kept secret all these years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In levelling these accusations against us, Singapore was\r\n\r\nasked to \"compromise\" and exhibit neighbourly behaviour.  The\r\n\r\ncomments  suggest that Singapore should accede to  Malaysia's\r\n\r\nexpressed concerns, regardless of whether they were  formally\r\n\r\nraised  or  substantiated  to be facts.   Anything  short  of\r\n\r\naccepting and abiding by the Malaysian concerns was deemed to\r\n\r\nbe  insensitivity  on our part towards  our  neighbours.   In\r\n\r\nessence,  we  were  being  asked to accept  a  zero-sum  fait\r\n\r\naccompli.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should we respond to all these unsubstantiated\r\n\r\nclaims  and allegations?  Sir, I suggest that the best course\r\n\r\nof  action  for  us  is not to be unduly perturbed  by  these\r\n\r\nstrident diatribes but proceed with our daily affairs  as  we\r\n\r\nhave many pressing issues in our national agenda.  Of course,\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  have good relations with Malaysia but,  as  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  said  recently, we  cannot  be  chasing  and\r\n\r\nanswering  each and every wild allegation that is made.   But\r\n\r\nif  a serious point has been made, backed by proper facts, we\r\n\r\nshould be ready to look at it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore would not want this afternoon to reply point-by-point to every one of the Malaysian allegations that\r\n\r\nMembers raised. Instead, I will briefly update Members on the\r\n\r\nstatus  of  our package negotiations and some Members  talked\r\n\r\nabout reclamation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the package, on 3rd May, when I replied to Mr Leong\r\n\r\nHorn  Kee  here  who requested for an update on  our  package\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  Members would recall that I said  that  I  had\r\n\r\nproposed a set of dates to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy counterpart, the Foreign Minister, Syed Hamid Albar for  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  between  both  sides  following  the  correspondence\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Prime  Ministers.  He had  offered  alternative\r\n\r\ndates  and  now officials on both sides are working  out  the\r\n\r\ndates  convenient to both of us.  I believe  that  they  will\r\n\r\nsoon  settle  the date for the first meeting.   Dr  Ong  Chit\r\n\r\nChung  asked  what has been the reaction to  what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  spoke about self-sufficiency in water.   But  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid  before,  Members would have read  the  statements  that\r\n\r\ndifferent leaders in Malaysia have said.  There has  been  no\r\n\r\nofficial government reaction and I do not think it was really\r\n\r\ncalled for.  When Prime Minister spoke on this, Members would\r\n\r\nhave  read  that Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah  Badawi  said\r\n\r\nthat if we wanted to look at other sources of water supply it\r\n\r\nis  up  to  us  and  he said that it is not going  to  affect\r\n\r\nnegatively or jeopardise bilateral ties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On reclamation, Members would recall that I spoke on\r\n\r\nthis  on  3rd May also in response to Mr Leong Horn  Kee.   I\r\n\r\ninformed  the  House that Malaysia had sent a  Note  on  30th\r\n\r\nApril on our reclamation works around Tekong and Ubin.   That\r\n\r\nwas the third Note after two previous Notes which had focused\r\n\r\non reclamation works in the Tuas area where they alleged that\r\n\r\nwe  had  violated their territorial sovereignty.  This  third\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Note  only contains general allegations  that  our\r\n\r\nTekong  reclamation  works  have  had  an  impact  on   their\r\n\r\nterritorial  waters, but there were no specific  facts,  none\r\n\r\nwhatever, details to substantiate their allegations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had replied and rebutted their two previous Notes. I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to inform Members that we have replied  to  this\r\n\r\nthird Note on 15th May 2002.  The Malaysian High Commissioner\r\n\r\nwas  called in to receive a copy of our official reply  where\r\n\r\nwe  stated that their allegations that our reclamation  works\r\n\r\nhad   caused  a  \"transboundary  environmental  impact\"  upon\r\n\r\nMalaysian  territorial waters and the claim that it  narrowed\r\n\r\n\"the waterway\" in Kuala Johor were unsubstantiated and lacked\r\n\r\nparticulars.  We therefore reminded the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh  Commissioner to ask his government to send  us  a  Note\r\n\r\nitemising their concerns in detail for us to study carefully.\r\n\r\nSo  in reply to Dr Ong Chit Chung, the answer is no.  We  are\r\n\r\nstill awaiting that comprehensive Note.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have said thus far about the package and\r\n\r\nreclamation  works  is factual.  But it  is  true  that  both\r\n\r\nmatters have become bell-wethers, in a sense, for the  course\r\n\r\nof  our bilateral relations.  It would be natural for many in\r\n\r\nthis  House,  and  many Singaporeans, to  conclude  that  our\r\n\r\nrelations with Malaysia are at a low point based on  the  way\r\n\r\nthese  and  other issues have hogged the headlines in  recent\r\n\r\nmonths.    There   is   no  denying  that  Singapore-Malaysia\r\n\r\nrelations  have encountered choppy waters, but  I  would  say\r\n\r\nthat  like  the tide which ebbs and flows, the current  rough\r\n\r\npatch  is  to  be  considered  as  normal  in  state-to-state\r\n\r\nrelations   between  immediate  neighbours.   Both   of   us,\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Malaysia,  share a  complex  and  interlinked\r\n\r\nrelationship and keeping it on an even keel is never an  easy\r\n\r\ntask.  Therefore, I agree with colleagues who have said  that\r\n\r\nboth  sides should view Singapore-Malaysia relations, not  in\r\n\r\nan  emotional  sense, bogged down by historical baggage,  but\r\n\r\nfrom a pragmatic and longer-term perspective, rather than try\r\n\r\nto seek short-term gains through one-upmanship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also noted what Ms Irene Ng has said just now.\r\n\r\nYes,  negotiating with the Malaysians is not easy.  But  does\r\n\r\nit  mean  we should not negotiate with them?  I do not  think\r\n\r\nthat  this is what she meant.  Our experience has been  that,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding all the difficulties, it is still possible to\r\n\r\nreach  agreements with the Malaysians, but this  is  provided\r\n\r\nthere is the political will and goodwill to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with her that if new issues are thrown into\r\n\r\nthe  package that is currently on the table, it will make the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  even  more  complicated  and  the  chances   of\r\n\r\nreaching  agreement even more slim.  But that is not  to  say\r\n\r\nthat in our bilateral relations new issues will not crop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup.  Events have shown that they do crop up, and we will have\r\n\r\nto deal with them as and when they emerge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this matter of \"skinning the cat\", many Members have\r\n\r\nalluded  to  Dr Mahathir's \"skinning the cat\" remarks.   They\r\n\r\nhave quoted from the Beritan Harian (Malaysia) report of  3rd\r\n\r\nMay, where he was quoted as saying \"We can skin a cat in many\r\n\r\nways.  To  skin Singapore, there is not just one method.\"   I\r\n\r\nwas  curious and looked up the various newspaper articles and\r\n\r\nmagazines and it would seem that Dr Mahathir seems to have  a\r\n\r\nfondness for skinning cats.  He has used this phrase \"we  can\r\n\r\nskin  a  cat  in many ways\" on several other occasions.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  in an interview with Asia Incorporated on 4th  May,\r\n\r\nin  answer to a question: \"If you have to describe Malaysia's\r\n\r\napproach to globalisation in one sentence, how would  you  do\r\n\r\nit?\",  and he replied, \"Firstly, listen to everyone.   Number\r\n\r\ntwo,  always accept that there are many ways to skin  a  cat,\r\n\r\nmany  ways  to  do things in order to achieve results.\"   and\r\n\r\nsimilarly, at the PEBC conference in Kuala Lumpur, when asked\r\n\r\nto explain Malaysia's approach in dealing with the 1997 Asian\r\n\r\nFinancial Crisis, he said:  \"People know that there are  many\r\n\r\nways  to  skin a cat.  We have chosen the unorthodox way  and\r\n\r\nthe cat has been neatly skinned.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge Members that we should take such\r\n\r\nremarks  in  our stride.  This is not the first time  and  it\r\n\r\nwill  not be the last time that we are called names.  We have\r\n\r\nbeen  called  all  kinds of names:  a `little  red  dot',  `a\r\n\r\npimple that won't burst', and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have also often been accused of being thick-skinned. So trying to skin us can be quite a daunting task.\r\n\r\nDespite all the name-calling that we have endured over  these\r\n\r\nyears, Singapore continues with our business, we continue  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  and we continue to prosper.  Cats, after  all,  have\r\n\r\nnine  lives, they say.  And no cat is ever going to lie  down\r\n\r\nmeekly to be skinned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would say to Members of the House that we should\r\n\r\nnot allow such name-calling to deter us from what we must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo to defend and promote our national interests.  Instead,  I\r\n\r\nthink  all  of us should look and take note of the underlying\r\n\r\nmessage  behind the metaphor, the underlying message  of  how\r\n\r\nseriously  they  intend to compete with us and  we  therefore\r\n\r\nhave to gird ourselves to meet this challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore-Malaysia relations are extremely\r\n\r\ncomplicated,  as  must be any relationship  of  close  inter-dependence.  There are different strands in the relationship,\r\n\r\nand  not  all  the  strands are neatly  compartmentalised  or\r\n\r\ncompatible. There will always be ups and downs.  And it is  a\r\n\r\nfact  that some Malaysians delight in putting Singapore down.\r\n\r\nBut  that strand of thinking revealed is not the only one  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   There  is also an understanding  that  given  the\r\n\r\nclose  inter-dependence  between our  countries,  what  hurts\r\n\r\nSingapore  will also hurt Malaysia.  And the  games  of  one-upmanship should not be allowed to go too far.   In fact,  Dr\r\n\r\nMahathir  himself  said so recently when  commenting  on  our\r\n\r\nreclamation  works,  on 14th April in Bernama:  \"We  must  be\r\n\r\ncareful  in handling a problem such as this because we  don't\r\n\r\nwant  to be at war with Singapore\" and he said, \"That's  why,\r\n\r\nwhen  handling  national affairs, we  have  to  be  extremely\r\n\r\ncareful and wise . .\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would repeat, let us not get too worked up over\r\n\r\nthese   remarks.   It  should  not  deter  us  from   seeking\r\n\r\ncooperation  with  Malaysia when  cooperation  is  to  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit.  But we must cooperate without illusions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say, let us take the Malaysian criticisms\r\n\r\nagainst  us in our stride.  There is no need to get  excited.\r\n\r\nThey  constitute a form of psy-war to weaken our  morale  and\r\n\r\nsoften   our   position  on  matters  under  negotiation   or\r\n\r\ndiscussion.  Let us quietly and politely state the facts  and\r\n\r\nstand on them.  Mr Ravindran said, put it on the website.   I\r\n\r\nwill ask my High Commissioner in KL, I know they are doing  a\r\n\r\ngood  job in disseminating all the speeches and positions  to\r\n\r\nvarious  quarters in Malaysia.  They have a website.   If  it\r\n\r\ncan  be  improved, Mr Ravindran said, let us do so.  But  the\r\n\r\nimportant point is that notwithstanding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  present cloudy atmospherics, we are committed to forging\r\n\r\na  long-term  relationship  with  Malaysia  based  on  mutual\r\n\r\nrespect  and sovereign equality.  We are neighbours  who  can\r\n\r\nand  should cooperate and realise the full potential  in  our\r\n\r\nbilateral relationship and find win-win solutions.  As PM Goh\r\n\r\nhimself  said,  both  countries should  in  fact  be  working\r\n\r\nclosely in order to consolidate and lead ASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung asked me:</b> Would I reflect on what are\r\n\r\nthe  lessons that we can learn from this?  I think there  are\r\n\r\nseveral useful lessons, if I may enumerate them.  I think the\r\n\r\npoints  are alluded to by Mr Chiam See Tong about  the  media\r\n\r\nand Mr Sin Boon Ann, too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we should not negotiate or try to raise\r\n\r\nbilateral  issues  in the mass media.   If  the  goal  is  to\r\n\r\nresolve  the  problem,  then conducting  bilateral  relations\r\n\r\nthrough  the media actually complicates finding a  resolution\r\n\r\nto  the issue.  Playing up bilateral issues through the media\r\n\r\nrestricts  the  manoeuvrability of both sides.   It  is  much\r\n\r\neasier to find a solution which would benefit both parties if\r\n\r\nsuch  issues  are quietly handled.  In fact, in an  interview\r\n\r\nwith  Straits  Times which my counterpart,  Foreign  Minister\r\n\r\nSyed  Hamid  Albar,  gave in 1999,  he  said:  \"But  what  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  sensitive and can be  misunderstood  and  can\r\n\r\ncreate  tension  should be kept outside the  public  domain.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he noted that quiet diplomacy would enable the points  of\r\n\r\ncontention to be resolved speedily by both sides.  That is  a\r\n\r\npoint  I  wholeheartedly  agree.  Unfortunately,  the  recent\r\n\r\npublic  comments  made  by  some politicians  and  the  media\r\n\r\nbarrage  there show that they have not heeded  his  words  of\r\n\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second lesson is that while disagreements are bound to\r\n\r\noccur  from time to time, it is very important to  keep  open\r\n\r\nour  channels of communication.  And I think this point  made\r\n\r\nby  Mr  Zainul  Abidin is relevant, by still maintaining  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  visits and so on.  So, I am glad that despite  the\r\n\r\nintense  barrage and roller-coaster rides that  Dr  Ong  Chit\r\n\r\nChung mentioned,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere   has   been  a  steady  exchange  of  visits   between\r\n\r\nSingaporean  and  Malaysian leaders since the  start  of  the\r\n\r\nyear.   Singapore  has  hosted visits by  Malaysian  leaders.\r\n\r\nMinisters  have come here and our Ministers have gone  there.\r\n\r\nBarisan  Nasional  Youth delegation came to  Singapore.   Our\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister visited Kuala Lumpur.  Our  President\r\n\r\nled the NUS team for the Games, and other Ministers like RAdm\r\n\r\nTeo  Chee Hean and BG George Yeo have made visits.   Mr  Wong\r\n\r\nKan  Seng  also led the MHA team up there and he  met  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  Abdullah  Badawi.   These  exchanges  should\r\n\r\ncontinue.    Perhaps  they  are  even  more  important   when\r\n\r\nrelations go through a rough patch.  It gives the opportunity\r\n\r\nfor  both  sides to share views and discuss key issues.   The\r\n\r\nagreement  by  the  youth wings of the PAP  and  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nNasional  to  formalise their relationship by establishing  a\r\n\r\nsecretariat is also a move in the right direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, and this touches on the point that Mr Sin Boon\r\n\r\nAnn  made  about  reciprocity, I think there  should  not  be\r\n\r\ndouble  standards  applied  to  the  cardinal  principles  of\r\n\r\nrelationships, such as the principle of non-intervention,  or\r\n\r\nnon-interference with the internal affairs  of  one  another.\r\n\r\nMore so, when the issue involved is sensitive, and which  can\r\n\r\nhave a possible impact on racial and religious harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tudung issue is a case in point. The point that Mr\r\n\r\nZainul  Abidin  mentioned is also relevant.   Some  Malaysian\r\n\r\npoliticians  continue to hold the position that they  have  a\r\n\r\nright  to  comment  on Singapore issues  involving  race  and\r\n\r\nreligion.  These comments do not help in any way in advancing\r\n\r\nour  bilateral  relations.  On the contrary, they  will  only\r\n\r\ncomplicate and confuse matters further.  For example, on  the\r\n\r\ntudung issue, it is not about the religious rights of Muslims\r\n\r\nin Singapore, and I fail to understand how Singapore's school\r\n\r\nuniform  policy  is  anything  but  a  domestic  issue  which\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, and this touches on the point which Miss Irene\r\n\r\nNg talked about agreement.  I think the relationship between\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia must be based on international law and\r\n\r\nthe  observance  of  agreements.   It  cannot  be  based   on\r\n\r\nsubjective   criteria,   or   based   on   emotionalism    or\r\n\r\nsentimentality.  Otherwise, there would be no basis to  judge\r\n\r\nwhether one's action was right or one's action was wrong.  As\r\n\r\na small country, Singapore adheres closely to this principle.\r\n\r\nThat  was  why we have stressed several times the  legal  and\r\n\r\nbinding nature of the Water Agreements or the POA.  And  that\r\n\r\nis  why we also repeatedly stated that our reclamation  works\r\n\r\nare  being carried out within Singapore's territorial waters,\r\n\r\nand  in accordance with international law.  Recently, Sir,  a\r\n\r\nNew  Straits Times editorial of 15th April, referring  to  my\r\n\r\nMinistry's   Addendum,   said  that  Singapore   was   \"over-legalistic\"  and  added,  and I  quote,  \"what  follows  from\r\n\r\nSingapore's overweening legalism is a fixation with  'facts',\r\n\r\n[fixation  with facts], the sort that would stand  up  in  an\r\n\r\nadversarial  court of law, and a foreclosing of the  flexible\r\n\r\npositions that would conduce to a friendly tete-a-tete.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, \"fixation with facts\"? \"Legalistic\"? Sticking to\r\n\r\nfacts  and  to  the  law surely is the  only  basis  for  any\r\n\r\nrelationship which is not based on the arbitrary wishes of  a\r\n\r\nsingle  party.   How  else can it be?   How  else  can  sound\r\n\r\ninternational relations be possible if we do not have  regard\r\n\r\nto  principles  of international law and agreements  lawfully\r\n\r\nentered  into  by governments?  Also, how can we  have  sound\r\n\r\nbasis for bilateral relations if we were to ignore facts  and\r\n\r\ninstead  rely on unsubstantiated allegations, distortions  or\r\n\r\nrumours?  Yes, we can have friendly tete-a-tetes.  And indeed\r\n\r\nwe are having them, as I mentioned all these to-ings and fro-ings.   But,  Sir, this cannot be at the expense of  ignoring\r\n\r\nfacts   or   at  the  expense  of  abandoning  solemn   legal\r\n\r\ncommitments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to conclude, let me stress again that it is not the\r\n\r\nintention of Singapore or interest to have strained relations\r\n\r\nwith  Malaysia.  We seek a cooperative relationship based  on\r\n\r\nmutual benefit and mutual respect.  Not one based on emotions\r\n\r\nor  historical  baggage, as some Members have  rightly  said.\r\n\r\nInevitably,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  will  be ups and downs in these relations.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  believe  that  both  sides should  address  the  problems\r\n\r\npragmatically,   on   equal  terms,  taking   a   longer-term\r\n\r\nperspective  without resorting to unsubstantiated allegations\r\n\r\nor  threats.  On this basis, Singapore and Malaysia can enjoy\r\n\r\na calm and balanced bilateral relationship.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members that we\r\n\r\nhave  about  5  items  and 4 replies to be  completed  in  20\r\n\r\nminutes' time.

I recall that, in the\r\n\r\nend,   both  sides  agreed  to  refer  the  dispute  to   the\r\n\r\nInternational  Court  for arbitration.  In  our  relationship\r\n\r\nwith  Malaysia,  we  have often lamented that  there  is  not\r\n\r\nenough  progress  because details cannot be  pinned  down  or\r\n\r\nagreed  to by both sides.  But in the case of this particular\r\n\r\ndispute over Pedra Branca, this agreement to refer the matter\r\n\r\nto  third  party arbitration seems to have placed us  further\r\n\r\nalong this road towards the determination of outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I read reports that some politicians in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  have  said  that they are pushing  for  the  matter\r\n\r\nbefore  the International Court to be expedited.  Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\ncertain  that Singapore's claim to Pedra Branca has full  and\r\n\r\nfirm  basis and we are surely just as keen to see a  decision\r\n\r\non this matter.  I would just like to ask the Minister for an\r\n\r\nupdate  on the status of the matter and what steps are  being\r\n\r\ntaken to have this arbitrated upon as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, it has been some time since this\r\n\r\nsubject was last brought up.

Even Malaysia  had\r\n\r\ncontinuously   and   consistently   recognised    Singapore's\r\n\r\nsovereignty  over Pedra Branca for more than 130 years  until\r\n\r\nit contested Singapore's ownership of the island in 1979.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I have noted that some Malaysian politicians have\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  case on Pedra Branca is already  before  the\r\n\r\nInternational Court of Justice, that they want to expedite or\r\n\r\naccelerate the hearing of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual or current position is that both Malaysia and\r\n\r\nSingapore  have agreed in 1998 on referring the case  to  the\r\n\r\nInternational  Court of Justice.  But the case  has  not  yet\r\n\r\nbeen  submitted  to  the Court, because there  is  a  certain\r\n\r\nprocedure that Malaysia and Singapore must follow in order to\r\n\r\ndo so.  The procedure was spelled out in 1998, when Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Malaysian senior officials reached agreement on the text\r\n\r\nof a draft Special Agreement to refer Malaysia's claim to the\r\n\r\nICJ.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that Agreement is subject to procedural requirements\r\n\r\nsuch  as a formal ratification of the Special Agreement,  and\r\n\r\nonly when that is done we can submit the case to the ICJ.

These efforts are well\r\n\r\nappreciated  both  in Jakarta and at the  provincial  levels.\r\n\r\nOur\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecent  suggestion to provide an export corridor for  exports\r\n\r\nfrom  Batam and Bintan to the US, under the proposed FTA,  is\r\n\r\nan  excellent effort to help Indonesia increase its  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth and create more employment for Indonesians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister as to what are his\r\n\r\nMinistry's   plans   to   further  promote   this   excellent\r\n\r\nrelationship between the two countries, particularly in three\r\n\r\nareas:  (i) in promoting greater trade and investment between\r\n\r\nthe   two   countries;  (ii)  whether  we  can  see   greater\r\n\r\ncooperation in the area of counter-terrorism; and (iii)  what\r\n\r\nmeasures  can  be  put in place to increase contacts  between\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament, bureaucrats, businessmen and people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> As both Dr Ong and Mr Ravindran said,\r\n\r\nwe   attach   great  importance  to  our  relationship   with\r\n\r\nIndonesia, and our relations are excellent.  Indonesia is one\r\n\r\nof   Singapore's  closest  neighbours  and  a  major  trading\r\n\r\npartner.   Actually  we have a deep and abiding  interest  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  stability  as a unitary state,  its  growth  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.  Indonesia is also strategically important to the\r\n\r\nregion.   Events  in Indonesia, such as political  strife  or\r\n\r\nIslamic militancy therefore can have severe repercussions  on\r\n\r\nSingapore as well as other ASEAN countries.  Therefore,  this\r\n\r\nunderscores  the importance of Indonesia, the  importance  of\r\n\r\nour  bilateral relations, and the impact of Indonesia in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Ravindran and Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about\r\n\r\ncooperation  on terrorism.  Let me say that at  the  official\r\n\r\nlevel,  our  agencies are cooperating closely with Indonesian\r\n\r\nauthorities  and  providing  them  with  the  information  to\r\n\r\nconduct their own investigations after we had assured them of\r\n\r\ngiving them access to the people we had arrested.  But I hope\r\n\r\nMembers will understand when I talk about cooperation in such\r\n\r\nareas on counter-terrorism and intelligence cooperation,  the\r\n\r\ndetails have to be kept confidential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked what we can do to nurture this\r\n\r\nrelationship.   It is a relationship that has been  based  on\r\n\r\nvery strong fundamentals, especially the close\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersonal  and institutional ties we have built over  some  30\r\n\r\nyears  with  Presidents, Ministers, officials,  and  recently\r\n\r\nwith  President  Megawati.   We have  also  established  good\r\n\r\nrelations  between her and our leaders.   As  you  know,  she\r\n\r\nvisited  Singapore soon after she was inaugurated as head  of\r\n\r\nstate.  We had good discussions with her and her delegation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Ministers have visited Indonesia and vice versa, and\r\n\r\nhave had good discussions with their counterparts.  They meet\r\n\r\nbilaterally.   They  also meet at the  sidelines  of  various\r\n\r\nmeetings.  There are also good contacts between officials.  I\r\n\r\nagree with Mr Ravindran that these are matters which we  must\r\n\r\nconstantly  nurture because there are new actors,  there  are\r\n\r\nnew  personalities, and it is not static.  You have  to  keep\r\n\r\nworking  at  it.  I can assure Members that my  Ministry,  as\r\n\r\nwell   as  other  Ministries,  is  very  cognisant  of  this,\r\n\r\nparticularly  with  Indonesia when  they  have  so  many  new\r\n\r\npersonalities  at  the centre as well as in  other  parts  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On economic cooperation, I believe Minister George Yeo\r\n\r\ndid touch on this when the Ministry of Trade and Industry was\r\n\r\ndiscussed.  We do want Indonesia to recover economically,  to\r\n\r\nplay  a  leading role in enhancing stability in  the  region.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  remain  ready to help  Indonesia  within  our\r\n\r\nlimited capabilities as a small country.  That is why we have\r\n\r\nsaid that we can play a catalytic role and find creative ways\r\n\r\nof  assisting Indonesia's economic recovery.  A good  example\r\n\r\nis  what Mr Ravindran mentioned, such as the extension of the\r\n\r\nUS-Singapore FTA to cover Indonesian IT products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is in these ways that Singapore, although we are\r\n\r\nsmall,  can  demonstrate  that we have  a  deep  and  abiding\r\n\r\ninterest if we want to work with Indonesia, and that we  will\r\n\r\ntry to be helpful when we talk to other countries to generate\r\n\r\nin  them  an  interest also in Indonesia, and in  Indonesia's\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong. \"Guillotine\" time is 5.05 pm.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore was privileged to be\r\n\r\nelected a non-permanent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmember  of the United Nations Security Council.

For example, how do we give input and\r\n\r\nideas in dealing with complex and difficult issues?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, continuing\r\n\r\nalong  this  line,  I would like to ask the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nthere seems to be a low level of perception of the importance\r\n\r\nof  this  multi-lateral diplomacy that we are doing, and  the\r\n\r\ninternational  organisations as fora that  we  embark  on  to\r\n\r\nprotect  our  own interest and to further our interest  as  a\r\n\r\nsmall  nation state, in pursuit of this international  public\r\n\r\nroute  of an open economy, of international commons  such  as\r\n\r\nfreedom  of the sea, anti-piracy, anti-terrorism.   I  wonder\r\n\r\nthis  low  level of perception is due to a lack of our  media\r\n\r\ncoverage  of our action.  What kind of initiatives  does  the\r\n\r\nMinister think we could do to improve on these?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Second Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Sir, our experience as an elected member of the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations  Security Council has  been  educational  and\r\n\r\ninstructive.   We  now have a better sense  of  the  internal\r\n\r\nworkings  and procedures of the Council.  We have  tried,  as\r\n\r\npart  of  our work on the Council, to try to make the Council\r\n\r\nmore transparent and accountable to the larger UN membership.\r\n\r\nIt  remains  clear that the influence of P5 countries  weighs\r\n\r\nheavily  in  the consideration of the issues in the  Council.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not only due to their power to veto resolutions,  but\r\n\r\ntheir  global  reach  and  access to information  around  the\r\n\r\nworld,  particularly in conflict areas.  On difficult  issues\r\n\r\nof  the  Council, where there are differences of opinion  and\r\n\r\npositions  among  the P5 countries, the elected  members  can\r\n\r\nplay a bridging role to help bring about a compromise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another lesson is the importance of Council's unity for\r\n\r\nit  to be effective.  For example, on the difficult issue  of\r\n\r\nthe   Middle  East,  the  Council  was  able  to  adopt  four\r\n\r\nresolutions  in  two months - March and  April  this  year  - unanimously.  However, recently, the lack of consensus in the\r\n\r\nCouncil resulted in its inability to respond to situation  on\r\n\r\nthe  ground.  Our approach at the Council has been guided  by\r\n\r\nour  consistent support for principles of international  law,\r\n\r\nobservance  of  the  UN  Charter  and  compliance  with   the\r\n\r\nresolutions of the Security Council.  Because we have  always\r\n\r\ntaken a consistent and principled approach, our friends  have\r\n\r\nbeen able to understand and appreciate our position, even  if\r\n\r\nit  means that we are unable to fully support them.  We  have\r\n\r\nalways  endeavoured to conduct ourselves in  a  credible  and\r\n\r\nresponsible manner in the Council.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In responding to Mr Chay, I agree with him that more can\r\n\r\nbe   done   to   publicise  what  we  do   in   international\r\n\r\norganisations.   We will see what more can  be  done.   As  a\r\n\r\nsmall  country, Singapore has been selective in applying  for\r\n\r\nmembership in international organisations.  Besides being  an\r\n\r\nelected  member  of  the UN Security  Council,  we  are  also\r\n\r\nelected  members of the UN Commission on International  Trade\r\n\r\nLaw  and  the Governing Council of the International Maritime\r\n\r\nOrganisation.   Being a small country,  it  is  also  in  our\r\n\r\ninterest  to work with other small states.  In 1992,  in  New\r\n\r\nYork,  Singapore  established an informal grouping  of  small\r\n\r\nstates  known as Forum of Small States.  It now comprises  85\r\n\r\ncountries  and  meets  a few times a year  under  Singapore's\r\n\r\nchairmanship to discuss issues of concern to small states.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various Singaporeans have contributed to the work of the\r\n\r\nUN.   For example, Ambassador Tommy Koh comes to mind for his\r\n\r\noutstanding work concerning the Law of the Sea.  We prefer to\r\n\r\ngo  about our work without fanfare.  It is our style to  work\r\n\r\nthrough quiet diplomacy and focus on results.

I wonder  if  the  Minister  could\r\n\r\nencourage more of these exchanges and training programmes  to\r\n\r\nbe  carried out, not only by Government agencies, but through\r\n\r\nNGOs  and  institutions,  like  the  Singapore  International\r\n\r\nFoundation, so that we can move for more understanding  among\r\n\r\nour neighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Lim, you have two minutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Sir, short answer to Dr Warren Lee is, yes,\r\n\r\nwe  will try to do more.

Some\r\n\r\ncountries  claim  that their arms spending is  to  modernise,\r\n\r\ncatch  up and complete projects that were put on hold  during\r\n\r\nthe  Asian financial crisis.  However, given the historically\r\n\r\ncompetitive  nature  of  the relationships  within  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia,  like between Thailand and Burma, Cambodia and Vietnam,\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Singapore, an apparent arms race is on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, it is now becoming clear that following\r\n\r\nthe  ouster  of the Taliban and the destruction  of  Al-Qaeda\r\n\r\ninfrastructure   in  Afghanistan,  Al-Qaeda  operatives   are\r\n\r\nseeking to set up new bases of operations in Southeast  Asia.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  an  American military chief  recently  voiced  his\r\n\r\nconcern  over such developments in Manila, and this  explains\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Americans are expanding their military presence  on\r\n\r\nthe ground, the Philippines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to what I think is the most dramatic\r\n\r\nchange  in the strategic environment after September 11:  the\r\n\r\nfrontline is no longer just something out there; it is  right\r\n\r\nhere  within  our  shores.  The frontline  lies  not  in  our\r\n\r\nmilitary   hardware  or  in  our  technical  software.    The\r\n\r\nfrontline lies within our collective hardware.  Do  we  feel,\r\n\r\nfirst and foremost, as Singaporeans committed heart and  soul\r\n\r\nto  the idea of Singapore, or are we being pulled apart  from\r\n\r\none another by a hundred different ideas?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the potential for a mass exodus of people from a\r\n\r\ncrisis-stricken  Indonesia is another area of  concern.   Are\r\n\r\nthere contingency plans in place if Indonesians were to  fall\r\n\r\nagain  into  a  period  of  protracted  economic  crisis   or\r\n\r\nprotracted  sectarian violence, thereby  resulting  in  large\r\n\r\nuncontrolled population movements?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after September 11, the nature of threats has\r\n\r\nchanged.

One cannot deny  that,  if\r\n\r\nnot  for  a strong and capable SAF, Singapore's standing  and\r\n\r\nprofile in the region would have been very different, and  it\r\n\r\nis  because of our strong and capable SAF that we are able to\r\n\r\nconduct  our  diplomatic relations with much  confidence  and\r\n\r\nassurance.  We have not only relied on deterrence as a  means\r\n\r\nof  securing peace and stability for Singapore, but  we  have\r\n\r\nalso  invested  heavily in maintaining strong ties  with  our\r\n\r\nneighbours  and friendly big powers.

We are coming to  realise\r\n\r\nthat  apart  from dealing with conventional threats,  we  now\r\n\r\nhave to deal with terrorism that, in itself, is a more subtle\r\n\r\nand  insidious  form  of  challenge.   Terrorism  is  a  non-conventional  threat, ie, low in intensity  in  nature.   The\r\n\r\nassault not only\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  come  in  the  form of flying jetliners  into  high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings,  but can also take the form, as we  all  know,  of\r\n\r\nbiochemical and cyberspace attacks.  In this regard, security\r\n\r\nrequirements  call  not  only for  SAF  to  deal  with  these\r\n\r\nchallenges alone but on a comprehensive basis involving other\r\n\r\nagencies  like  the  Police Force and SCDF  to  counter  such\r\n\r\nthreats.   Indeed,  the recent arrest of  \"Jemaah  Islamiyah\"\r\n\r\nterrorists  and the neutralisation of these cells only  serve\r\n\r\nto  remind us that such threats are real and are not confined\r\n\r\nto distant lands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Tony Tan said recently that the demand for security\r\n\r\nagencies  and  the terrorists are not equally  balanced.   We\r\n\r\nrequire  our  security  agencies to succeed  in  looking  and\r\n\r\nneutralising  these terrorist groups all the time.   However,\r\n\r\nall  it takes is for these groups to succeed only once for  a\r\n\r\nhigh profile statement of their intent to create chaos and to\r\n\r\ninstill  fear  and anxiety in our population.  Against  these\r\n\r\nchallenges,  I would like to ask whether the SAF  is  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of broadening its spectrum of capability to  respond\r\n\r\nto  such low intensity threats and challenges, and whether or\r\n\r\nnot  we  will  be  working closely with  the  other  security\r\n\r\nagencies,  such  as  the Malaysians, the  Filipinos  and  the\r\n\r\nIndonesians  have  done  recently to share  intelligence  and\r\n\r\ninformation in order that we can more effectively  deal  with\r\n\r\nsuch threats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, Foreign Minister\r\n\r\nJayakumar,  GPC  Chairman Ong Chit Chung  and  my  colleagues\r\n\r\nbefore  me  have  provided a good overview of  the  strategic\r\n\r\nsituation  in the region.

This\r\n\r\nwill  have  implications on the regional situation  here.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the Defence Minister can give his sense of how regional\r\n\r\nsecurity will shape up given these uncertainties and MINDEF's\r\n\r\nresponse to this new situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I join my GPC colleagues in asking\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence in sharing\r\n\r\nwith   us  what  are  the  changing  security  and  strategic\r\n\r\nsituation  in the Asia-Pacific, in particular, the  state  of\r\n\r\nthe  tripolar relationship between China, Japan and  the  US.\r\n\r\nWhat  are the existing relationship between Taiwan and China,\r\n\r\nespecially in regard to the Straits of China?

More  importantly, what  are  the  external  and\r\n\r\ninternal  challenges  facing  many  of  the  Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  how Singapore can respond to  this  external\r\n\r\nenvironment,   particularly   the   security   and   military\r\n\r\nenvironment that is fast changing in Southeast Asia?\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> The dispute over bilateral\r\n\r\nissues  between Malaysia and Singapore has led  to  the  word\r\n\r\n\"war\"  being bandied about recently from across the Causeway.\r\n\r\nSuch  talk of war should not be taken lightly, even if it  is\r\n\r\njust  talk.  It could heighten tension and suspicion  between\r\n\r\nthe  two countries.  It could also give foreign investors the\r\n\r\nwrong  signal  about  the stability of this  region,  already\r\n\r\ntroubled by terrorist threats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in February, when the Malaysians were unhappy\r\n\r\nover  our water supply agreement and the unhappiness  was  at\r\n\r\nits  peak,  the retired General Zaini Mohamed Said  wrote  in\r\n\r\nMingguan Malaysia that the dispute over water supply was  the\r\n\r\n\"most serious\" among potential regional threats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  Malaysia,  as  it could lead to war with  Singapore.   He\r\n\r\nadvised  that  the issue be handled carefully by  leaders  on\r\n\r\nboth  sides.  He also reminded Malaysians that the  Singapore\r\n\r\nmilitary  was  stronger  and more sophisticated.   Later,  in\r\n\r\nanother  column,  he  warned about a  \"small  nation  with  a\r\n\r\npowerful army\" and said that Malaysia must prepare itself  to\r\n\r\ngive  any attacker \"a bloody nose\".  This phrase was repeated\r\n\r\nby  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad last month when he  spoke\r\n\r\nabout  Malaysia's recent arms purchases.  He  said,  \"We  are\r\n\r\nbuying  weapons  only for our defence.   Those  who  want  to\r\n\r\nattack us, we promise we will give them a bloody nose.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia recently sealed its largest defence deal in a\r\n\r\ndecade  for  Russian and European missiles worth about  S$674\r\n\r\nmillion.   It  signed several multi-million dollar  contracts\r\n\r\nfor  weapons, including a rocket-launching system, submarines\r\n\r\nand tanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans were not rattled by the war rhetoric or by\r\n\r\nthese  arms purchases by Malaysia because they were confident\r\n\r\nof the capabilities of the Singapore Armed Forces.  Outsiders\r\n\r\nhave  also acknowledged that it is the leading military force\r\n\r\nin  Southeast Asia and is a significant deterrent force.   We\r\n\r\nshould  continue upgrading our SAF and to give  the  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  of  our Armed Forces the support and recognition  that\r\n\r\nthey  deserve.  The people who make up our Armed Forces  make\r\n\r\nan  enormous contribution to Singapore's place on  the  world\r\n\r\nstage.  The budget allocated to the Defence Ministry is money\r\n\r\nwell spent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own view is that Malaysia and Singapore are unlikely\r\n\r\nto  go to war, as long as strong and rational leaders prevail\r\n\r\nfrom  both  sides.  However, a geopolitical setting  that  is\r\n\r\nfluid  and  uncertain  in  itself  also  poses  a  threat  to\r\n\r\nstability.   This is because countries will then  want  their\r\n\r\narmed  forces  to be primed in such a way that prepares  them\r\n\r\nfor  worst-case scenarios.  While this psychological  priming\r\n\r\nis almost inevitable, it is important\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore continues to widen and deepen  its  bilateral\r\n\r\nand  multilateral  defence relations  to  promote  peace  and\r\n\r\nstability  in  the  Asia-Pacific region.  Confidence-building\r\n\r\nexercises are also important for managing the undercurrent of\r\n\r\ntension and suspicion between regional states.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nMinister  for Defence what is the state of defence  relations\r\n\r\nwith  Malaysia, and for an update of Singapore's  efforts  to\r\n\r\npromote  regional  peace and stability  in  the  Asia-Pacific\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, September 11 has changed the\r\n\r\nstrategic landscape in Southeast Asia.  Terrorism is  global,\r\n\r\nterrorism  is  elusive.   Southeast  Asian  nations  are  now\r\n\r\nchallenged  and  targeted  by  amorphous  terrorist   groups.\r\n\r\nUnlike the open campaign previously against communist Vietnam\r\n\r\nat  the height of the Cold War, it is difficult to ferret out\r\n\r\nand combat elusive terrorists.  They seem to be everywhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister whether the SAF is ready and\r\n\r\nhas  contingency  plans for dealing with  outright  terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks, hijacks, attacks on our computer information system,\r\n\r\nchemical warfare and biological warfare.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Madam, post-September 11, the threat\r\n\r\nof  global  terrorism  has been keenly  felt  throughout  the\r\n\r\nworld.  The JI arrests in Singapore showed very clearly  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is very vulnerable to such threats and we  came  so\r\n\r\nclose  to  being a real victim of attack.  We know  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has set up various coordinating structures between\r\n\r\nrelevant Ministries and has also enhanced protection for  key\r\n\r\ninstallations.  I am sure that necessary policies  and  steps\r\n\r\nare also being put in place to anticipate and neutralise,  or\r\n\r\notherwise deal with, such threats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, what I am more concerned about is the preparation\r\n\r\nof  our  population in the light of this changed setting.   I\r\n\r\nfirmly believe that, more and more, the effectiveness of  our\r\n\r\ntotal defence strategy will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlie in how well we strengthen the non-military defence areas,\r\n\r\neven as we continue to strengthen our military defences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. The greatest harm that terrorism can\r\n\r\ninflict on the people is not the immediate deaths and  damage\r\n\r\nthat  those terrorist acts exact.  It is the loss of  morale,\r\n\r\nthe  lingering uncertainty and fear associated with  tackling\r\n\r\nan  enemy  that  is  in the shadows.  For  this  reason,  the\r\n\r\npsychological resilience of the people is key to  a  nation's\r\n\r\nresponse  to terrorism, and psychological resilience  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  that can be left to the armed forces  or  security\r\n\r\nforces  alone.  It must involve different ways of  informing,\r\n\r\nsensitising  and preparing the people for certain  scenarios,\r\n\r\nwithout  frightening  them  and causing  undue  anxiety  that\r\n\r\nbackfires on public morale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that after the Prime Minister told us that some\r\n\r\nof the escaped JI terrorists had wanted to hijack an aircraft\r\n\r\nand  crash it into Changi Airport, a television station  went\r\n\r\nto   interview  some  people  at  the  airport,   and   those\r\n\r\ninterviewed were Singaporeans who work at the airport or were\r\n\r\ngoing  to  travel through the airport.  The general  response\r\n\r\nwas that they did not think that such a thing would happen to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  because Singapore is such a safe place.   Another\r\n\r\nperson said that perhaps people would be more careful for the\r\n\r\nfirst few weeks but, after that, it would be forgotten.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am not advocating paranoia. But this shows\r\n\r\nthat  much  more  needs to be done on a  sustained  basis  to\r\n\r\nprepare our population to understand the new setting that  we\r\n\r\nare in and to know what we can do as individuals, communities\r\n\r\nand nation, to strengthen our resilience towards this threat.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask the Minister if his Ministry  would  be\r\n\r\ntaking additional steps in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Madam, this year, the defence budget is,\r\n\r\nonce  again,  way below the cap set at 6% of  the  GDP.   The\r\n\r\nactual  amount is $7.69 billion.  In 2001, the actual defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure  was  $7.09 billion and, in 2000,  it  was  $6.56\r\n\r\nbillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some may comment that we are overspending on\r\n\r\ndefence  and  see there is money spent without hard  tangible\r\n\r\nbenefits,  I beg to disagree with them.  Defence expenditures\r\n\r\nplay  a  key  role  in having a Keynesian multiplier  effect.\r\n\r\nThere are also externalities experience from the state-of-art\r\n\r\ntechnologies developed and adopted in the defence  sector  by\r\n\r\norganisations like the Defence Science and Technology Agency.\r\n\r\nThese  can have civilian applications and they can help boost\r\n\r\ngrowth.   In  addition,  the  expenditure  also  creates  and\r\n\r\nprovides  jobs,  training and education to a  large  pool  of\r\n\r\npeople.   It  creates  jobs  in  the  marine,  aerospace  and\r\n\r\nengineering  industries.  Finally and, most  importantly,  it\r\n\r\nindirectly  supports the growth of the economy by creating  a\r\n\r\nsecure environment for trade and investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we are situated in a unique geopolitical\r\n\r\nsituation.   The  strategic  and  political  environment  can\r\n\r\nchange  rapidly and catch everyone off guard.   In  addition,\r\n\r\nthe  challenge  of international and domestic  terrorism  has\r\n\r\nbrought  a  new sense of realism that a threat can come  from\r\n\r\nboth  within and outside.  In the light of these developments\r\n\r\nand   the  recent  resumption  of  arms  acquisition  by  our\r\n\r\nneighbours, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Defence whether we are spending adequately  on\r\n\r\ndefence.   I  would  also like to ask him whether,  at  these\r\n\r\nlevels   of   expenditure,  we  are  able  to  maintain   our\r\n\r\nqualitative and quantitative advantage against our  potential\r\n\r\naggressors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Madam, as a former member of\r\n\r\nACCORD, I benefitted tremendously in understanding SAF from a\r\n\r\nclose  range.  Last Saturday, I visited the Combat  Engineers\r\n\r\nat Seletar, and I left the base even more reassured about our\r\n\r\nSAF  and  our  defence capabilities.  Whether in  technology,\r\n\r\nhuman   resource   development,  training   and   operational\r\n\r\nconsiderations, I could see SAF's seriousness, efficiency and\r\n\r\ndetermination in the security and defence of our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see some of our 18-20-year-old NSmen managing our\r\n\r\ngigantic Bionics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLaunched  Bridge evoked a powerful emotion in  me  about  the\r\n\r\ninner strength of our SAF.  It convinced me that the increase\r\n\r\nin  defence budget to ensure that Singapore is well  prepared\r\n\r\nfor the uncertainties of the future is well deserved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One challenge, however, is for the SAF to continue to\r\n\r\nwin  the  hearts of its soldiers and Singaporeans in  general\r\n\r\nfor  what  it  is  doing.   I  am glad  that  the  Government\r\n\r\ncontinues to include NSmen in its offer of rebates for income\r\n\r\ntax  and Singapore Shares and, now, the ERS.  Perhaps, it  is\r\n\r\nalso  time to review the modest allowances for our NSmen,  to\r\n\r\nhelp instill a greater sense of belonging and service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I would like to urge the Ministry to review\r\n\r\nits total defence programmes to ensure a better understanding\r\n\r\nand rapport with the people.  It would be worthwhile also  to\r\n\r\nsee  how ACCORD could do more to bond the public and the SAF.\r\n\r\nI  gather that Mindef is doing a lot of work in reaching  out\r\n\r\nto  the people through the Discovery Centre and the Air Force\r\n\r\nMuseum,  and  I also look forward to the Ministry  having  an\r\n\r\nArmy  Museum.  That will help us to bond the people with  the\r\n\r\nSAF further.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Madam, in recent years, the Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces  have  participated in  a  number  of  overseas\r\n\r\noperations  that  are not necessarily of a  training  nature.\r\n\r\nMembers will recall that we had a team in the early 1990s  to\r\n\r\nhelp  with  the  peacekeeping efforts in  Namibia  and,  more\r\n\r\nrecently,   in  East  Timor,  where  we  not  only   provided\r\n\r\npeacekeeping troops there but also logistics support that the\r\n\r\ninternational troops require.

One of the most concrete\r\n\r\nways  for the Government to indicate its recognition  of  the\r\n\r\nwork and contribution of National Servicemen is to review the\r\n\r\nallowances   paid  to  them.  Such  review  has   been   done\r\n\r\nperiodically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence, I believe, told the\r\n\r\nmedia  very  recently, which I read in the  papers  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  might  be  reviewing  the  allowance  for  National\r\n\r\nServicemen.   I  would like to ask the Minister  for  Defence\r\n\r\nwhether  such a review has been completed and,  if  so,  when\r\n\r\nwill the revised rates of allowances take effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Currently, our\r\n\r\nyoung  men  are called up to serve national service  for  two\r\n\r\ndifferent  lengths of time.  Majority of our youths  serve  a\r\n\r\ntwo-year  stint  in  national service, whilst  the  commander\r\n\r\ngrade  serve  another  six  months.   The  NS  system,  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand, had since then undergone some changes.  In  order\r\n\r\nto  encourage our youths to be fit for NS upon enlistment and\r\n\r\nthereby  cutting  time  that  otherwise  would  be  spent  on\r\n\r\nbuilding their fitness, the fitter of the lot is cut  by  two\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that Mr Chiam has raised the issue of shortening\r\n\r\nthe  length of NS before in 1991.  Let me state that I am not\r\n\r\nspeaking in support of him. Rather, things then and now  have\r\n\r\nchanged so much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the September 11 incident, I appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  heightened concern over security.  It might be  untimely\r\n\r\nto  bring this up now but I feel the length of NS, especially\r\n\r\nthat  for  a better-educated youth, might be reviewed  for  a\r\n\r\nshorter period.  I have two reasons for my proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the advent of modern technology in warfare has\r\n\r\nrendered conventional warfare almost obsolete.  Wars  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger fought and won based on territorial occupation and the\r\n\r\nuse of numerical forces.  The recent Afghan War is a case  in\r\n\r\npoint.  My point here is this.  The development and advent of\r\n\r\ninformation  technology is very significant in  the  way  our\r\n\r\nsecurity forces can be and is organised.  Wars are fought and\r\n\r\nwon   sometimes  even  without  seeing  your  enemies.    The\r\n\r\nefficiency and battle-readiness of a defence force  need  not\r\n\r\nbe compromised with the reduction of troops.  There is lesser\r\n\r\nand lesser need for a large standing army.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second and, more importantly, allow me to argue for the\r\n\r\nenhancement  of our youths' competitiveness in the  light  of\r\n\r\nglobal competition for talent.  Our young talents suffer from\r\n\r\nan   uneven   competition  compared  to  their   counterparts\r\n\r\nelsewhere who do not have to serve NS.  Our youths  join  the\r\n\r\nworkforce  mostly in their mid-twenties.  I  have  seen  many\r\n\r\ntimes  where  our young graduates are much older  than  their\r\n\r\nforeign counterparts in university.  Not only that, they  are\r\n\r\nalso  saddled  with  debts which they have  to  service  upon\r\n\r\ngraduation.   I wonder what is the opportunity cost  to  them\r\n\r\nand  to  the Singapore economy as a whole.  I also wonder  if\r\n\r\nperhaps  that  is  the reason why we are so scarce  of  local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.  I also feel that we owe our NS youths,  after\r\n\r\nthe  contribution of their prime time of their lives  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry, the duty to enhance their economic value as much  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can allow those fitter NSF men to serve a shorter\r\n\r\nstint,  can we not then have an overall review of the  length\r\n\r\nof our NS?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Madam Chairman, I thank the Members of\r\n\r\nParliament for their relevant comments on defence  policy  on\r\n\r\nthe  SAF.  I will deal with some of the points that have been\r\n\r\nraised  so  far.   My  colleagues, the  Second  Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence,   the   Minister  of  State  for   Defence,   Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary for Defence will then deal with  some\r\n\r\nof the other points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has embarked on a process of self-examination.\r\n\r\nSince  our independence in 1965, we had a business plan which\r\n\r\nenabled us to achieve significant progress and success in our\r\n\r\neconomy.   But  times  change, and the fundamentally  changed\r\n\r\ncircumstances now require us to re-examine our business  plan\r\n\r\nand  the  way  we  do things.  In short, we  have  to  remake\r\n\r\nSingapore.   We have to restructure our economy  and  address\r\n\r\npressing  social issues ranging from social cohesion  to  the\r\n\r\nimplications of a low birth rate and an aging population.  As\r\n\r\npart  of  the process of change, we must expect that some  of\r\n\r\nour long-held policies will have to be updated or revised  to\r\n\r\nmeet the new challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we rethink and debate the economic and social\r\n\r\npolicies  that  will make Singapore the  best  home  for  our\r\n\r\npeople,  one thing remains constant, and that is the absolute\r\n\r\nimportance  of a strong defence for Singapore.  A  prosperous\r\n\r\neconomy  and a vibrant society must be supported by a  strong\r\n\r\nsecurity foundation if it is to continue thriving.    Without\r\n\r\nsecurity,  without a strong defence, there  is  no  guarantee\r\n\r\nthat Singapore will continue to survive, let alone thrive, as\r\n\r\nan  independent, sovereign nation.  I am therefore  heartened\r\n\r\nto  note  the  resounding support which all the Members  have\r\n\r\nexpressed  this  afternoon for maintaining a  strong  defence\r\n\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now comment on the point which Dr Ong Chit Chung\r\n\r\nhas brought up as to whether Singaporeans will pull\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntogether  when  there is crisis.  During the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nPresident's   Address  last  month,  Dr  Vivian  Balakrishnan\r\n\r\nstirred  up a minor controversy, both within and outside  the\r\n\r\nHouse,  when he related in Parliament the question which  his\r\n\r\n11-year old son asked him:  \"If there is a war, why should we\r\n\r\nfight  for  Singapore?\"  This  is  not  a  trivial  question.\r\n\r\nNeither  is  it a question that should not be  asked.   Every\r\n\r\ngeneration  must  confront this question.   Every  generation\r\n\r\nmust  decide  for themselves why they should be  prepared  to\r\n\r\nfight and, possibly, to die for their country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patriotism is an emotionally charged subject. It stirs\r\n\r\nup   the   most   fundamental  emotions  and   reactions   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, and this is rightly so.  One does not  talk  of\r\n\r\nwar  lightly.  Neither is war a subject simply to be  debated\r\n\r\nin   Parliament  or  in  the  correspondence  pages  of   our\r\n\r\nnewspapers.  Given the terrible consequences of war, going to\r\n\r\nwar  is  the  most serious and fundamental decision  which  a\r\n\r\ncountry  has to make.  When to go to war, how to go  to  war,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  circumstances dictate a need for a  country  to\r\n\r\nresort  to war, these are fundamental issues which no  leader\r\n\r\nand  no  Singaporean can treat lightly with glib  remarks  or\r\n\r\nclever rhetoric.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patriotism has different meanings for different\r\n\r\nindividuals.   Patriotism is something that  must  come  deep\r\n\r\nfrom  within each individual.  Patriotism cannot be  mandated\r\n\r\nor  forced.   In  deciding why one should  be  patriotic  and\r\n\r\nwilling to fight for one's country, different people will  be\r\n\r\nmotivated  by  different  reasons.  For  example,  Dr  Vivian\r\n\r\nBalakrishnan's son concluded his conversation with his father\r\n\r\nby  telling  Vivian  that  he,  ie,  the  son,  would  defend\r\n\r\nSingapore  because this is his home and his  family  and  his\r\n\r\nfriends are here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the House, a Singaporean who lives in Canada\r\n\r\nposted a note to the Straits Times Interactive to say that if\r\n\r\nwar  were  to  break  out, he would fly  back  to  fight  for\r\n\r\nSingapore simply because he wanted \"to fight for my home,  my\r\n\r\nfamily  and friends\".  Another writer, Mr Teh Peijing,  wrote\r\n\r\nto  the Straits Times and this is what he said, \"In my  case,\r\n\r\nmy main motivation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  fighting in the event of a war would be my friend Norman\r\n\r\nas well as other colleagues of mine.  And I believe that this\r\n\r\nis  the case for most Singaporeans serving in the SAF:   that\r\n\r\nthey  would  fight mainly to be there for their  friends  and\r\n\r\ncomrades  in  arms with whom they have shared  sweat  on  the\r\n\r\ntraining  grounds of the SAF.\"  The reasons I have cited  are\r\n\r\ngood  and  powerful motivations for people to be prepared  to\r\n\r\nfight for Singapore should the need arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering this subject, I think that it is also\r\n\r\nhelpful  to  ponder the reasons why people  are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nleave their country of birth to settle in another country  to\r\n\r\nmake a life for themselves and their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Khaw Boon Wan and Ms Irene Ng are two such\r\n\r\nindividuals.  Both born in Penang, highly educated,  able  to\r\n\r\nsettle anywhere in the world, both of them decided that their\r\n\r\ndestinies would lie with Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Khaw Boon Wan and Irene Ng are persons of ability\r\n\r\nand  drive.  They could have had successful careers in Penang\r\n\r\nor,  if they wanted to leave their home town, they could have\r\n\r\nsettled  in  the  countries in which they  had  their  higher\r\n\r\neducation  -  Khaw Boon Wan in Australia,  and  Irene  Ng  in\r\n\r\nEngland, for a higher degree.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Australia and England are bigger countries than\r\n\r\nSingapore.    Both  of  them  have  larger   economies   than\r\n\r\nSingapore's.  Both have more land, certainly in the  case  of\r\n\r\nAustralia.   For  talented  and determined  individuals,  the\r\n\r\nprospects of a successful career could be better in Australia\r\n\r\nor England than here, in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we ask ourselves: why then should Khaw Boon Wan and\r\n\r\nIrene  Ng decide to throw in their lots with Singapore?   The\r\n\r\nanswer,  in  my view, lies in the values which both  of  them\r\n\r\nidentified as the core strengths of Singapore:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Meritocracy and Fair Play;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Equal Opportunities;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Clean Government; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Racial and Religious Tolerance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Khaw Boon Wan said, and I quote, \"these core values\r\n\r\nhave  been fundamental tenets of our nation for the  last  40\r\n\r\nyears.\"   The core values constitute the Singapore Cause  for\r\n\r\nwhich  Khaw  Boon Wan was prepared to leave his  hometown  to\r\n\r\nsettle  and  build  a future for himself and  his  family  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Of all the core values, meritocracy is central to\r\n\r\nthe realisation of a Singapore nation as we know it.  As Khaw\r\n\r\nBoon Wan said, \"Meritocracy is a powerful idea.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irene Ng expressed the same sentiment in her words:\r\n\r\n\"Meritocracy  is one of our founding principles,  so  is  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  equality of treatment and  non-discrimination.\r\n\r\nWe  must  make  it clear that discrimination based  on  race,\r\n\r\nreligion, gender, age or national origin is not tolerated  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We must give each individual and each  group  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  and  hope that they have equal  opportunities  to\r\n\r\nrealise  their aspirations, even if unequal outcomes are  the\r\n\r\nresult.   We cannot guarantee success, but we must  guarantee\r\n\r\nequality of opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she valued these principles, Irene Ng said:\r\n\r\n\"This  is  why I left Malaysia for Singapore when  I  was  16\r\n\r\nbecause  this country offered me the opportunity to  live  my\r\n\r\nlife  based  on  these  principles.  I became  a  Singaporean\r\n\r\nbecause I wanted to be a part of a country that upholds these\r\n\r\nprinciples.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chairman, the principles on which our nation is\r\n\r\nfounded  -  Meritocracy and fair play;  Equal  Opportunities;\r\n\r\nClean  Government; and Racial and religious tolerance  -  are\r\n\r\nembodied in this small island of 680 square kilometres, which\r\n\r\nall  of  us call home, because Singaporeans believe in  these\r\n\r\nprinciples and are prepared to defend them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building on the principles and core strengths, we have\r\n\r\ncreated  a  prosperous and thriving country that is  able  to\r\n\r\ngive  a  decent standard of living to all its  citizens.   We\r\n\r\nhave gained international respect as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na nation, that may be small by physical standards, but we are\r\n\r\na   nation   that  stands  by  our  principles  and  beliefs.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is a nation that has often been cited as  a  model\r\n\r\nfor other countries to emulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not small achievements. The Singapore in\r\n\r\nwhich  we  live  today  is a large  achievement.   It  is  an\r\n\r\nachievement which all Singaporeans can justifiably  be  proud\r\n\r\nof.   And  not  only  be proud of, but also  be  prepared  to\r\n\r\ndefend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that so many Singaporeans have sacrificed their\r\n\r\ntime  and  disrupted their careers to serve  our  country  in\r\n\r\nNational Service; the fact that Singaporeans of all races and\r\n\r\nages  strongly support the building of a strong SAF; the fact\r\n\r\nthat  Total Defence is not an empty slogan in Singapore,  but\r\n\r\nan important concept taken seriously by all Singaporeans; all\r\n\r\nthese are evidence that Singaporeans value Singapore and  all\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore stands for.  So, when the question is  asked:\r\n\r\n\"If there is a war, why should we fight for Singapore?\", I am\r\n\r\nconfident  that,  whether  or not  they  can  articulate  the\r\n\r\nreasons,  Singaporeans will rally to defend our country  and,\r\n\r\nif  necessary,  make the ultimate sacrifice to  preserve  and\r\n\r\nuphold  the  principles and values which  we  hold  dear  for\r\n\r\nourselves and for our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the security situation in our\r\n\r\nenvironment, a topic which has been commented on  by  Dr  Ong\r\n\r\nChit Chung, Ms Irene Ng and Mr Ravindran.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. Members have noted, the need for security\r\n\r\nhas  in fact taken on even greater importance.  Last year,  I\r\n\r\ntold  the Committee of Supply that there was more uncertainty\r\n\r\nin  the  regional  security environment.  Developments  since\r\n\r\nthen  have  made the security environment even  more  complex\r\n\r\nthan  any  of  us could have imagined just a  year  ago.   In\r\n\r\nparticular, the threat spectrum has greatly expanded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now all too familiar with the threat of a new\r\n\r\ntype  of  terrorism  which is called catastrophic  terrorism.\r\n\r\nThis has injected greater uncertainty when the region has yet\r\n\r\nto fully recover from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn  and  the socio-economic  dislocations  of\r\n\r\npolitical  leadership transitions.  As Members  have  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  unfortunately,  this  new threat  is  not  some  remote\r\n\r\nproblem somewhere in another part of the world.  We have  all\r\n\r\nseen  the  chilling scenes of the surveillance by  the  local\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah terrorist network.  We have heard of  their\r\n\r\nplans to construct 7 truck bombs - 3 tons of ammonium nitrate\r\n\r\neach  -  21  tons altogether.  It requires 1 ton of  ammonium\r\n\r\nnitrate bomb to demolish the building in Oklahoma City in the\r\n\r\nUS.  Imagine how horrific the consequences would have been if\r\n\r\nthese  extremists had managed to pull off their plans to  set\r\n\r\noff these bombs in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides catastrophic global terrorism, there are other\r\n\r\nnon-conventional threats that we have to be vigilant against.\r\n\r\nWe have to continue to be alert to these security challenges,\r\n\r\ncertainly at least over the next few years.  The much greater\r\n\r\npolitical  and  social instability in  our  region,  and  the\r\n\r\neconomic uncertainty, have also raised the potential of  what\r\n\r\nis  called Low Intensity Conflict.  In 1998, for example,  we\r\n\r\nexperienced an upsurge in illegal immigrants trying to  enter\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Fortunately, our firm response quickly put a stop\r\n\r\nto  this flow.  But many security threats are trans-border in\r\n\r\nnature, and international borders are porous.  The impact can\r\n\r\nalso be far-reaching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Singapore is vulnerable, and we must be prepared to\r\n\r\nmeet  such  security  challenges as they arise,  whether  the\r\n\r\nproblem be illegal immigrants, piracy, cyber-attacks or other\r\n\r\nforms  of  terrorism  from  sources  other  than  the  global\r\n\r\nterrorist networks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the House that these newer\r\n\r\nthreats, while dangerous, and we have to tackle them, are not\r\n\r\nin  place  of,  but they are in addition to  our  fundamental\r\n\r\nsecurity  concerns that we have faced since our  independence\r\n\r\nin  1965, and which lie at the heart of our very existence as\r\n\r\na sovereign, independent nation.  The circumstances of how we\r\n\r\nbecame  independent brought us to the quick realisation  that\r\n\r\nour highest priority as a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnation  must  be to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore felt very vulnerable then in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nToday, we no longer feel as vulnerable because we now have  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  defence capability.  But we must remain  acutely\r\n\r\naware  that the external environment is not as benign  as  we\r\n\r\nmay  wish  it to be.  We must remain very conscious  that  we\r\n\r\nmust  have  the wherewithal - the will and the  muscle  -  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  our  security, and to ensure that we  will  always\r\n\r\nhave  the  space to act according to our own best  interests,\r\n\r\nand not succumb to pressure by others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A credible defence capability is absolutely critical for\r\n\r\nthe  prosperity of Singapore.  We learned the  bitter  lesson\r\n\r\nfrom our experience in World War II.  And we continue to  get\r\n\r\nfrequent reminders from the example of other countries  which\r\n\r\nfall  prey  to hostile forces, because they could not  defend\r\n\r\nthemselves,  as well as on many occasions, from  the  hostile\r\n\r\nrhetoric and speeches of politicians in other countries  that\r\n\r\nwe  frequently hear.  Sometimes there is even talk of war, as\r\n\r\nhas been mentioned by some Members today.  We need a credible\r\n\r\ndefence  force to ensure that talk of war remains talk,  just\r\n\r\nmere rhetoric, and no one is tempted to go beyond rhetoric to\r\n\r\ntake  action  which  directly threatens our  sovereignty  and\r\n\r\nterritorial integrity and our vital interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chairman, from the debate on the Estimates of the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, and from the comments of Members\r\n\r\njust now, Singaporeans, all of us, are all too aware that our\r\n\r\nrelations  with  our neighbours go through frequent  ups  and\r\n\r\ndowns.   It  is a roller-coaster ride.  We are likely  to  go\r\n\r\nthrough more of such cycles in the years ahead.  This is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  of  our choosing.  It is more profitable,  and  we\r\n\r\nwould  much  rather focus on cooperation  in  all  sectors  - economic, cultural, education, even security - which  can  be\r\n\r\nof  mutual benefit and help to strengthen relations.  And  we\r\n\r\nare  always  looking  for such opportunities.   But  we  must\r\n\r\nalways  make sure that should the mood turn nasty against  us\r\n\r\nand demands are made of us on a host of issues as has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhappened,  and will happen from time to time -  we  have  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  to ride out the storm, not to react hastily,  but\r\n\r\nnot  to  knuckle  in under any pressure.  And  the  SAF,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Armed Forces, gives us that confidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a few words about our Defence Policy. Members have\r\n\r\nsought  assurance  that  our defence policy  is  adequate  to\r\n\r\nensure  Singapore's security in the face of the  spectrum  of\r\n\r\nthreats that we could potentially have to deal with.  I thank\r\n\r\nMembers  for  pointing  out the need  to  maintain  and  even\r\n\r\nincrease  our defence Budget, as some Members have suggested,\r\n\r\nso  that we will be able to deal effectively with the  threat\r\n\r\nof  terrorism  and  low  intensity conflict  in  addition  to\r\n\r\nconventional military threats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chairman, we have always given, and will continue\r\n\r\nto  give, the highest priority to security and defence.  Over\r\n\r\nthe  years, we have put in consistent effort, investment  and\r\n\r\nsacrifice  to  build  up  the  SAF.   Today,  the  SAF  is  a\r\n\r\ntechnologically-advanced   and  operationally-ready   defence\r\n\r\nforce.   The  SAF's capabilities were not built up overnight,\r\n\r\nneither was it built up by sudden spurts in defence spending.\r\n\r\nEach  of our operational capabilities is the result of  long-term   planning,  a  well-considered  acquisitions  strategy,\r\n\r\nstructured training, and systematic maintenance.  And we have\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  do  so because of our policy  of  maintaining\r\n\r\ndefence spending at a steady rate, up to a maximum of  6%  of\r\n\r\nGDP  each year.  I commend Mr Ravindran and Mr Zainul  Abidin\r\n\r\nRasheed  for  saying that we should ensure that defence  gets\r\n\r\nthe support from Government that it needs.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capability development programmes sometimes require\r\n\r\nspending  commitments  spread over  many  years  -  from  the\r\n\r\nacquisition of new weapons systems and training of operators,\r\n\r\nto  sustaining research and development and periodic  upgrade\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for the enhancement of mature systems.   To  keep\r\n\r\nsuch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  defence  capability  in good, sharp condition  requires  a\r\n\r\nsustained long-term commitment, and I am indeed gratified  by\r\n\r\nthe  commitment which Members have expressed  today  for  our\r\n\r\ndefence effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Mdm Chairman, even as we continue to enhance\r\n\r\ndeterrence,   we  are  fully  aware  of  the  importance   of\r\n\r\nencouraging  friendship and cooperation with other  countries\r\n\r\nand  other  armed  forces - both in the  region  as  well  as\r\n\r\nfurther  afield.  We know that the stability of our  security\r\n\r\nenvironment  can  only  be  preserved  by  countries  working\r\n\r\ntogether  -  a  point  made  by several  Members  today.   So\r\n\r\ndeterrence and diplomacy form the twin pillars of Singapore's\r\n\r\ndefence policy.  We have strong bilateral relationships  with\r\n\r\nmany  countries, from many of which the SAF benefits  greatly\r\n\r\nin  the  form  of professional interactions,  and  access  to\r\n\r\ntraining   facilities  and  defence  technology.    We   also\r\n\r\ncontribute,  as best as we can, to multilateral institutions,\r\n\r\nsuch as the United Nations, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and the\r\n\r\nFive  Power  Defence Arrangement, because these  institutions\r\n\r\nprovide  an  important layer to the security architecture  in\r\n\r\nthe  region.   One  particular area where the  SAF  has  made\r\n\r\ncontributions is in UN peacekeeping missions.  Currently,  we\r\n\r\nare  involved in the peacekeeping missions in East Timor, the\r\n\r\nKuwait-Iraq border, and the Ethiopia-Eritrea border.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure Members that only SAF regulars are  sent  on\r\n\r\nsuch  UN  missions.  National Servicemen are deployed  on  UN\r\n\r\npeacekeeping missions only if they themselves volunteer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word on the point brought up by Mr Sin Boon Ann about\r\n\r\nParliament and our defence policies.  There is no doubt  that\r\n\r\nParliament  is  the highest body in the land.   All  policies\r\n\r\nimplemented by the Ministry of Defence must be in  line  with\r\n\r\nthe laws passed by this Parliament, and with the Constitution\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  The Ministry of Defence reports to the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister   and  the  Cabinet  who  are  in  turn   themselves\r\n\r\naccountable to Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words about the issue of counter-terrorism and\r\n\r\ncounter-low intensity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconflict,  a point brought up by Mr Sin Boon Ann and  Dr  Ong\r\n\r\nChit  Chung.  They have asked about our ability to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe  threat  of  terrorism and low intensity conflict  (LIC).\r\n\r\nLet me assure the House that the SAF has the capabilities  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with what the military terms as OOTW (Operations  Other\r\n\r\nThan War).  These capabilities of the SAF have been developed\r\n\r\nover the years and they are constantly being upgraded as  the\r\n\r\nsituation demands.  For the threats of low intensity conflict\r\n\r\nand  global  catastrophic terrorism, we are fully aware  that\r\n\r\nwhile  the SAF may have the capabilities, the military  alone\r\n\r\ncannot  effectively counter such threats.  The SAF  needs  to\r\n\r\nwork  with other Government agencies in Singapore.   This  is\r\n\r\nnot  new, as we have long had inter-agency efforts to  tackle\r\n\r\nvarious  security issues, especially between the SAF and  the\r\n\r\nHome  Team.   For  example,  MINDEF,  the  Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,  the  Ministry of Health and  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment have been working together for many years on bio-chemical  defence.  The Navy and the Police Coast Guard  have\r\n\r\nalso   worked  together  for  many  years  to  stop   illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants coming to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realised that the inter-agency efforts need to be\r\n\r\ntightened  and  strengthened when the nature of  the  threats\r\n\r\nchanged and the threats become more real, as a consequence of\r\n\r\nthe deteriorating political and socio-economic conditions  in\r\n\r\nthe  region.   Our national security apparatus has  therefore\r\n\r\nbeen  beefed  up  to  deal with possible contingencies.   The\r\n\r\nNational   Security   Secretariat  and  a   ministerial-level\r\n\r\ncommittee,  chaired by me, as the Minister  for  Defence  and\r\n\r\nknown  as the Security Policy Review Committee, were  set  up\r\n\r\nwith  the  objective  of  providing a swift  and  coordinated\r\n\r\nresponse to non-conventional security threats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the need for coordination and integration of our\r\n\r\nefforts  became even more urgent after the event of September\r\n\r\n11  last year.  The threat of terrorism now requires a  level\r\n\r\nof  intelligence,  of monitoring, and of  response  which  is\r\n\r\nquantitatively  and qualitatively different  and  many  times\r\n\r\nmore  demanding than what our system - or any system  in  the\r\n\r\nworld -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  so far been geared to handle.  So we have put into place\r\n\r\na  comprehensive crisis response and management structure  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the new requirements.  This system is constantly  being\r\n\r\nrefined and enhanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorist threat is not unique to Singapore. Other\r\n\r\ncountries in our region have uncovered terrorist cells linked\r\n\r\nto  the  Al  Qaeda terrorist network.  While Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries  deal  in  their  own  ways  with  the  threat   of\r\n\r\nterrorism, to their security, all of us recognise the need to\r\n\r\ncooperate to combat this common enemy.  One area where  there\r\n\r\nhas   been   useful  cooperation  is  in  the   exchange   of\r\n\r\nintelligence.   At  the  beginning of this  year,  the  Joint\r\n\r\nCounter-Terrorism Centre was created to integrate Singapore's\r\n\r\nmulti-agency intelligence efforts as well as to serve as  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  contact  for  counter-terrorism  intelligence  cooperation among friendly countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been able to adapt to the new security\r\n\r\nenvironment  -  swiftly and with confidence - in  large  part\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  Total Defence.  When the Jemaah  Islamiyah\r\n\r\ngroup  was  uncovered in December and the  rest  took  place,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans were neither gripped with fear nor paralysed  by\r\n\r\npanic.   Our  people could withstand the jolt to  our  social\r\n\r\nfabric and take this threat in our stride.  Singaporeans also\r\n\r\nhad  the  confidence that the security authorities, including\r\n\r\nthe  SAF, could deal with the contingencies and safeguard our\r\n\r\nsecurity.   Singapore remained unshaken  as  we  have  strong\r\n\r\nfoundations in Total Defence - Psychological Defence,  Social\r\n\r\nDefence, Economic Defence, Civil Defence and Military Defence\r\n\r\n-  and we must continue to strengthen this, as pointed out by\r\n\r\nMr Heng Chee How and Mr Zainul Abidin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go on to the topic of National Service which has\r\n\r\nbeen  commented  on by Dr Ong Chit Chung, Dr Warren  Lee,  Mr\r\n\r\nZainul  and Mr Heng Chee How.  The Government, as I said,  is\r\n\r\nfully  committed to providing for Singapore's  security,  and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  by  and  large,  support  this  commitment  to\r\n\r\ndefence.   It  is  a commitment which goes beyond  supporting\r\n\r\nspending on defence to serving National\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nService.  Our young men have to commit 2-2 1/2 years of their\r\n\r\nlives,  starting from the age of 18 years old, and thereafter\r\n\r\ncommit a few weeks a year to service in the SAF.  And, should\r\n\r\nSingapore actually come under threat, they may have  to  make\r\n\r\nthe ultimate sacrifice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1967, about 600,000 of Singapore's sons have\r\n\r\npledged  the  Oath of Allegiance to protect  and  defend  our\r\n\r\nnation.   We  are now into the second generation of  National\r\n\r\nServicemen  -  young  men following their  fathers  into  the\r\n\r\nservice of our country.  This year marks 35 years of National\r\n\r\nService.  NS is a national institution.  NS has become a rite\r\n\r\nof  passage  for Singapore men.  Shared NS experience  brings\r\n\r\ntogether  Singaporeans  from  different  social,  racial  and\r\n\r\nreligious backgrounds in the common mission of defending  our\r\n\r\nhomeland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members have noted, the economic progress and\r\n\r\nstability we enjoy today are possible only because we have  a\r\n\r\ndefence  capability and security, and our defence  capability\r\n\r\nis  possible only because of the dedication and sacrifice  of\r\n\r\nour  National Servicemen.  They form the backbone of a strong\r\n\r\nand  capable  SAF.  As citizen soldiers, National  Servicemen\r\n\r\nhave  to balance the demands of their civilian lives  and  NS\r\n\r\nduties.   This  involves commitment and no  small  amount  of\r\n\r\nsacrifice.   It has therefore been a matter of  priority  for\r\n\r\nMINDEF  to  give  recognition and show appreciation  for  the\r\n\r\ncontributions   of  our  National  Servicemen.    MINDEF   is\r\n\r\ncommitted  to implementing the recommendations of  the  Third\r\n\r\nCommittee  to  Recognise  the Contribution  of  Operationally\r\n\r\nReady  NSmen to Total Defence (or RECORD III).  Indeed,  many\r\n\r\nof  the  recommendations have already  been  implemented  and\r\n\r\nMINDEF is actively working on the implementation of the other\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond this, MINDEF has been conducting an in-depth\r\n\r\nreview  of  our  NS system and policies.  This review  covers\r\n\r\nmany issues, affecting both full-time and operationally-ready\r\n\r\nNational  Servicemen.  They include examining ways to  refine\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNS training system, improve NS management and administration,\r\n\r\nand  enhancing  the NS experience overall.   The  review  was\r\n\r\nsupplemented by comprehensive surveys of National  Servicemen\r\n\r\nand  studies  of other foreign conscription systems.   A  key\r\n\r\nconsideration was that any changes, as a consequence  of  the\r\n\r\nreview,  must  not  undermine the operational  readiness  and\r\n\r\neffectiveness of the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One focus of the MINDEF review was on NS allowance.\r\n\r\nBefore I go into the details of the changes, which I will now\r\n\r\nannounce, let me reiterate some of the fundamental principles\r\n\r\nof  the  NS  allowance.  National Service is a  duty  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   National  Service is not a regular  salaried  job.\r\n\r\nFull-time   National  Servicemen  are   therefore   paid   an\r\n\r\nallowance; they are not paid market wages.  The NS  allowance\r\n\r\nis meant for basic personal upkeep, given that most full-time\r\n\r\nNational  Servicemen stay in camp, where accommodation,  food\r\n\r\nand clothing are provided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on these principles, the NS allowance will be\r\n\r\nrestructured   and  streamlined  to  reflect  the   different\r\n\r\nresponsibilities undertaken by our National Servicemen.   The\r\n\r\nrevised NS allowance will comprise two main components - rank\r\n\r\nallowance   and   combat  allowance.   Those  in   leadership\r\n\r\npositions   will   receive  a  higher  rank   allowance,   in\r\n\r\nrecognition  of the responsibilities they have  to  shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe  combat allowance will be paid to National Servicemen  in\r\n\r\ncombat  vocations, to recognise the onerous nature of  combat\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision will result in a significant increase in\r\n\r\nthe  NS allowance across all ranks.  For example, the monthly\r\n\r\nNS  allowance for a Recruit will increase from presently $240\r\n\r\nto  $350.   A  Corporal in a combat job will receive  $520  a\r\n\r\nmonth (up from $330), a Third Sergeant will receive $660  per\r\n\r\nmonth  (up  from $420) and a Second Lieutenant  will  receive\r\n\r\n$970 per month, instead of $650.  MINDEF will also raise  the\r\n\r\nadditional allowances given to operationally-ready NSmen  who\r\n\r\nhold key or command appointments.  This is in recognition  of\r\n\r\nthe vital leadership roles which such servicemen play and the\r\n\r\nadditional responsibilities they are asked to shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised NS allowances will be implemented as from\r\n\r\n1st  July this year, in conjunction with the 35th anniversary\r\n\r\nof   National  Service.   More  details  on  the  revised  NS\r\n\r\nallowance  will be given by MINDEF in a press  release  which\r\n\r\nwill be issued after my speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chairman, the NS review is still in progress. We\r\n\r\nare  now  looking  into the operationally-ready  NS  training\r\n\r\ncycle  and  examining  ways  to  improve  NS  management  and\r\n\r\nadministrative  efficiency.   I  thank  Members   for   their\r\n\r\nsuggestions  and I assure them their views and comments  will\r\n\r\nbe  taken  into account.  I hope to announce the  outcome  of\r\n\r\nthese reviews later this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few words on the length of National Service, a point\r\n\r\ntouched  on  by Dr Chong Weng Chiew.  The length of  National\r\n\r\nService  is determined by the time required to train our  men\r\n\r\nto  a  level of military proficiency where they can not  only\r\n\r\nhandle their personal equipment but also fight effectively as\r\n\r\nan  integral  part  of a large military  formation  -  up  to\r\n\r\nbattalion, brigade and division level.  The aim is to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  SAF  is operationally ready and  effective.    The\r\n\r\nprocess  has to be thorough and robust, so that our men  have\r\n\r\nthe   confidence   to   fight  and   win,   when   necessary.\r\n\r\nTechnologically sophisticated weapons and equipment  increase\r\n\r\nthe  potency  and  firepower  of our  soldiers,  sailors  and\r\n\r\nairmen.  They can reduce the need for manpower in many cases.\r\n\r\nBut  it still takes time to master these weapons and to learn\r\n\r\nhow to employ them effectively, both individually and as part\r\n\r\nof  an  integrated larger fighting force.  This is  something\r\n\r\nthat we cannot compromise on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that MINDEF would not want\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to spend more time than necessary to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  National Service duties, because we are acutely  aware\r\n\r\nof the commitment and the sacrifices they have to make.  This\r\n\r\nis  something  that  we are also carefully  studying  in  our\r\n\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chairman, let me conclude by saying that few, among\r\n\r\nour  older generation, will ever forget the tumultuous  years\r\n\r\nin  the  early  years of our history.  It is a  testament  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's success that our children have known  only  peace\r\n\r\nand  progress.   But we should never forget that this  is  in\r\n\r\nlarge  part  because  we  have put considerable  effort  into\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  our defence capabilities.  We have peace  today\r\n\r\nbecause  generations of Singaporeans have put in considerable\r\n\r\nsweat and sacrifice to make Singapore safe and secure through\r\n\r\nNational  Service.   But  once our defence  capabilities  are\r\n\r\neroded,  it  will not be long before we feel vulnerable  once\r\n\r\nagain and  our security is put at risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we remake Singapore to meet the challenges of the\r\n\r\nfuture,  as  we  must, let us not take defence  for  granted.\r\n\r\nOnly  when  we have guaranteed our security, can we guarantee\r\n\r\nthat Singapore will have a future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, can you take your two cuts\r\n\r\ntogether, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Mdm Chairman, compared with other\r\n\r\narmed  forces,  SAF is small.  But, with technology,  it  can\r\n\r\npack a powerful punch, maximising intelligence, mobility  and\r\n\r\nfirepower.   Technology is the SAF's trump card  in  ensuring\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  its  strategy of deterrence and,  if  deterrence\r\n\r\nfails,  in overwhelming the enemy with superior mobility  and\r\n\r\nfirepower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid technological advances over the last 30 years\r\n\r\nhave  led to what is termed a Revolution in Military  Affairs\r\n\r\n(RMA).  Revolution in Military Affairs is broadly defined  as\r\n\r\na  military  revolution in which the entire  armed  force  is\r\n\r\ntransformed and renewed in terms of technology, organisation,\r\n\r\nstrategy, tactics, training, doctrine and logistics.  The RMA\r\n\r\nevolves   around  three  advances.   First,   in   terms   of\r\n\r\nintelligence gathering, using sensors in satellites, aircraft\r\n\r\nor  unmanned aircraft, which can monitor virtually everything\r\n\r\ngoing  on  in  an  area.  Second, in processing  intelligence\r\n\r\nthrough   advanced   command,  control,  communications   and\r\n\r\ncomputing  systems, known as C4, making  sense  of  the  data\r\n\r\ngathered by the sensors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  displaying  it  on screen for target selection.   Third,\r\n\r\nacting  on  the intelligence, for example, by using precision\r\n\r\nmissiles to destroy enemy targets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new warfare would be multi-dimensional, ie, air, sea\r\n\r\nand   land   operations  would  be  increasingly  integrated.\r\n\r\nInformation and outer space would also be part of the  modern\r\n\r\nwar.   Another  important  element  of  RMA  is  \"information\r\n\r\nwarfare\",   disabling  enemy  by  wrecking   his   computing,\r\n\r\nfinancial,  telecoms  or  air  traffic  control  system  with\r\n\r\nviruses,  or  electromagnetic  pulses.   There  is  indeed  a\r\n\r\nserious  concern  that the \"information strike\"  could  crash\r\n\r\none's computer system in the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most serious problem for those who espouse the RMA\r\n\r\nis  that  enemies  could counter or copy the capabilities  so\r\n\r\ngenerated.    Every  breakthrough  in  offensive   technology\r\n\r\neventually  inspires an advance in defence.  My  question  is\r\n\r\nwhether  SAF  is exploiting technology fully to give  it  the\r\n\r\ncutting   edge   and  updating  its  strategy  and   doctrine\r\n\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, SAF has been involved with UN peacekeeping\r\n\r\noperations for a number of years.  Recently, we have sent SAF\r\n\r\ncombat  teams, as DPM has said, for peacekeeping missions  in\r\n\r\nEast  Timor,  besides  medical and support  group.   In  this\r\n\r\ncontext, I wish to ask the Minister for his assessment of the\r\n\r\nperformance of our SAF contingents and the lessons  we  learn\r\n\r\nfrom such missions overseas.  What are the reactions or state\r\n\r\nof  morale of our troops in such missions? Are there plans to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  send  SAF  teams to  East  Timor  or  to  other\r\n\r\npeacekeeping missions elsewhere?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Second Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Defence (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mdm Chairman, I will deal with Dr Ong's question on\r\n\r\npeacekeeping and the Minister of State, Mr Cedric  Foo,  will\r\n\r\ndeal with the subject of technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 900 SAF personnel have participated in UN\r\n\r\npeacekeeping missions around the world over the past dozen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears.

We\r\n\r\nhave  contributed to the international missions in East Timor\r\n\r\nin  both  INTERFET  and UNTAET.  Peace and stability  in  our\r\n\r\nregion is important for Singapore's security, and we are glad\r\n\r\nthat we are able to make our contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the SAF has a platoon of peacekeepers in\r\n\r\nFohorem in the western sector of East Timor, near the border.\r\n\r\nThe  deployment will soon go into its third rotation  of  six\r\n\r\nmonths.   Our platoon is deployed as part of the New  Zealand\r\n\r\ncomposite  battalion, which includes contingents  from  Fiji,\r\n\r\nIreland  and  Nepal.  I visited our men  in  Fohorem.   Their\r\n\r\nmorale  is  high  and  they are doing their  job  well.   The\r\n\r\ndeployment  is progressing well and we have had good  reports\r\n\r\nfrom   the  UNTAET  Headquarters  in  Dili  on  the   platoon\r\n\r\nprofessionalism and operational readiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has gained useful peacekeeping knowledge and\r\n\r\nexperience from this deployment in East Timor.  Singapore has\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  continue  with our  current  deployment  of  a\r\n\r\nplatoon of peacekeepers until this November.  The UN Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  is  expected shortly to endorse the details  of  the\r\n\r\ncomposition and size of the peacekeeping force which will  be\r\n\r\nestablished in East Timor after its independence day on  20th\r\n\r\nMay.  This will be UNTAET's successor mission, the UN Mission\r\n\r\nof  Support  in East Timor (UNMISET).  When the  details  are\r\n\r\nannounced, Singapore will assess the situation and  determine\r\n\r\nwhat  size force we will contribute.  Our objective, as  with\r\n\r\nall our commitments to UN peacekeeping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperations,  would be to participate in a manner  whereby  we\r\n\r\ncan make a useful contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng (Minister of State for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng):</b> Mdm Chairman, I would like to thank the hon. Member,\r\n\r\nDr  Ong Chit Chung, for raising the question about the use of\r\n\r\ntechnology  in the SAF.  I want to assure him and Members  of\r\n\r\nthe   House  that  the  words  RMA  (Revolution  in  Military\r\n\r\nAffairs),   CA   (Comprehensive  Awareness),  C4I   (Command,\r\n\r\nControl,  Communications and Computers and Intelligence),  PS\r\n\r\n(Precision  Strikes), and so forth, are  words  that  we  use\r\n\r\neveryday in MINDEF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has, from its earliest days, recognised the\r\n\r\ncritical importance of technology in helping us overcome  our\r\n\r\nconstraints in manpower and other resources.  Technology acts\r\n\r\nas  a force multiplier by enhancing the capabilities and  the\r\n\r\nfirepower of the SAF.  We have seen the devastating power  of\r\n\r\ntechnology  in  the war in Afghanistan.  In  modern  warfare,\r\n\r\nindeed,  the  odd favours the side that makes better  use  of\r\n\r\ntechnology;  the side that can integrate platforms and forces\r\n\r\ninto  a unified, flexible and effective fighting system;  the\r\n\r\nside that can see better and further on the battlefield;  the\r\n\r\nside  that makes informed decisions more quickly, strike with\r\n\r\ngreater accuracy and from further afar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A larger number of troops is indeed no longer enough to\r\n\r\nwin  modern  wars.  A strong capability in defence technology\r\n\r\nis  also  critical  for the quality of our training  and  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness of our equipment.  As a national service  armed\r\n\r\nforces,  it  is vital that if ever our men have  to  go  into\r\n\r\ncombat,  they go with the confidence that they have  superior\r\n\r\ntraining and superior equipment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has been making a steady and significant\r\n\r\ninvestment  of  resources over the years to give  the  SAF  a\r\n\r\nstrategic  technological  edge.  First,  we  have  helped  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  local defence industry.  Today,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTechnology   group   undertakes   activities   ranging   from\r\n\r\nmanufacture to full life cycle support of weapon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystems  and equipment for the SAF.  This group of  companies\r\n\r\nalso  upgrade as well as develop advanced weapon systems  for\r\n\r\nthe SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This indigenous capability, which we cannot buy, is very\r\n\r\nimportant  to  the  SAF.  We have also built  up  a  pool  of\r\n\r\nengineering and scientific talent and develop our  capability\r\n\r\nin  defence  R&D.  DSO National Laboratories  is  the  single\r\n\r\nlargest  R&D organisation in Singapore.  We also do extensive\r\n\r\ncollaboration    with    local    and    overseas    research\r\n\r\nestablishments.   Locally, there have  been  many  successful\r\n\r\ncollaborative  projects  with NUS,  NTU  and  other  research\r\n\r\ninstitutes.   Overseas, our partners include the  US,  France\r\n\r\nand  Sweden.  Such collaborative efforts allow us to leverage\r\n\r\non  the capabilities and resources of others, so that the SAF\r\n\r\ncan  be  at  the  leading  edge in meeting  the  increasingly\r\n\r\nsophisticated and complex demands of modern warfare.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We spend roughly 4% of our defence budget on R&D. This\r\n\r\ndoes  not  include money spent on the development of  upgrade\r\n\r\nprogrammes   and  indigenous  systems.   Such  a   commitment\r\n\r\nunderscores the importance we attach in ensuring that the SAF\r\n\r\nhas  the edge over potential adversaries.  This is a critical\r\n\r\nelement of our deterrence policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, would you like to withdraw your\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, I wish to thank the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and the Ministers for their full answers  and,\r\n\r\nin  particular,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  the  very\r\n\r\ngenerous increase in NS allowances.

The medical  corps  of  the  SAF  also\r\n\r\nperforms a crucial function during operations and even during\r\n\r\npeacetime,   to  preserve  life  and  reduce  suffering   and\r\n\r\nmorbidity.  I urge the Ministry of Defence to explore the use\r\n\r\nof   sophisticated  training  mannequins  and  computer-aided\r\n\r\nprogrammes   to   improve  training   realism   for   medical\r\n\r\nvocationalists in our army, especially at the level  of  both\r\n\r\nactive and NS battalions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may not be necessary for sophisticated mannequins to\r\n\r\nbe  used at all times.  A mix of sophisticated and simplified\r\n\r\ntraining aids may be all that is necessary.  To echo Minister\r\n\r\nof  State,  Mr  Cedric Foo, perhaps we could  even  get  some\r\n\r\nindigenous capability in this regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next cut is on NSmen memorial. On the occasion of\r\n\r\nthe  35th  Anniversary of National Service  in  Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nwould urge the Minister for Defence to consider some sort  of\r\n\r\nnational  memorial to celebrate the institution  of  National\r\n\r\nService.   This  memorial  should not  only  commemorate  the\r\n\r\nsacrifices of our NSmen and their family members, but  should\r\n\r\nalso celebrate the role of National Service in Total Defence,\r\n\r\nnation  building and in promoting racial harmony.  It  should\r\n\r\nperhaps  celebrate the citizen-soldiers' dual role in society\r\n\r\nand  also reflect the SAF's role, not in having had to  fight\r\n\r\nfor  freedom, but as a powerful deterrent and guardian of our\r\n\r\nnational security.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Mdm Chairman, I thank\r\n\r\nDr  Lee  for his comments and his questions.  If I may answer\r\n\r\nthe  second question first, because MINDEF and the SAF  place\r\n\r\ngreat  importance  on the topic raised by  Dr  Lee,  and  the\r\n\r\ntopics   of   training  and  the  contribution  of   National\r\n\r\nServicemen are close to our hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a word about training. National Servicemen in\r\n\r\nthe  SAF undergo rigorous and realistic training.  To enhance\r\n\r\nproficiency and operational readiness, the SAF conducts  many\r\n\r\nlocal  and  overseas exercises.  Despite  the  high  training\r\n\r\ntempo,  the SAF has maintained a good, in fact, an  excellent\r\n\r\ntraining  safety record.  This is due to the strong  emphasis\r\n\r\nplaced on safety at all levels within the SAF.  The challenge\r\n\r\nis  not  to  avoid  training but to pro-actively  manage  our\r\n\r\ntraining activities to minimise risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are detailed safety procedures for every training\r\n\r\nactivity   in  the  SAF.   These  procedures  are   carefully\r\n\r\ndisseminated to all soldiers involved.  Before each  training\r\n\r\nactivity,  ground  commanders  systematically  identify   the\r\n\r\npotential risks, using a risk assessment matrix, what we call\r\n\r\nthe RAM.  These risks are then managed through measures, such\r\n\r\nas   safety   briefings,  close  supervision,   precautionary\r\n\r\nactions,  and rehearsals and rehearsals prior to  the  actual\r\n\r\nexercises.    In   addition,  safety  audits  are   routinely\r\n\r\nconducted  to  ensure that the highest safety  standards  are\r\n\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last five years, there have been very few\r\n\r\naccidents  and  deaths involving National Servicemen  in  the\r\n\r\nSAF.   However, we recognise that every death, every accident\r\n\r\nis  just  one too many.  MINDEF's priorities in dealing  with\r\n\r\ntraining-related accidents and deaths are 3-fold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, is to avoid such fatalities wherever\r\n\r\npossible.   We, therefore, emphasise training safety  without\r\n\r\ncompromising training realism and operational standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, MINDEF investigates every incident thoroughly\r\n\r\nto  avoid  similar situations being repeated in future.   For\r\n\r\nevery  case, an inquiry involving third parties is  involved,\r\n\r\nswiftly convened to examine the circumstances leading to  the\r\n\r\naccident  and  recommend  any improvements  to  the  training\r\n\r\nsystem.   The findings are reported to the highest  level  in\r\n\r\nMINDEF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we help the bereaved family deal with the grief\r\n\r\nand come to terms\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the death.  In this respect, MINDEF has a comprehensive\r\n\r\nsystem  in place to provide prompt assistance and support  to\r\n\r\nthe  family.   Unit  commanders and professional  counsellors\r\n\r\nkeep  in close contact with the serviceman's family.   MINDEF\r\n\r\nalso  gives  the family financial assistance and compensation\r\n\r\npayment, where applicable.  The serviceman will also  receive\r\n\r\na military funeral, if requested by the bereaved family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee asked MINDEF and the SAF to also recognise the\r\n\r\ncontribution  of National Servicemen, indeed, the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nNational  Service.   Every year, on 1st July,  SAF  organises\r\n\r\nwhat we call an SAF Day Parade.  This is a very important and\r\n\r\nsolemn  occasion.  The occasion is to mark the importance  of\r\n\r\nthe   contribution  of  National  Service   as   a   national\r\n\r\ninstitution,  and the contribution of National Servicemen  to\r\n\r\nnational security.  In addition, a minute's silence  is  also\r\n\r\nobserved, to pay tribute to the National Servicemen who  have\r\n\r\nlost their lives in the course of duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, with your indulgence, I will repeat the citation\r\n\r\nmade  before  the 1-minute silence.  The MC of  the  occasion\r\n\r\nwill say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr President, Ministers, ladies and gentlemen,\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the SAF has not been called to battle, precious\r\n\r\nsons  of  Singapore have lost their lives in  the  course  of\r\n\r\nservice  in  the SAF.

They are selected\r\n\r\nto  provide  the appropriate pedagogic technique relevant  to\r\n\r\nthe   provision  of  medical  knowledge,  as  well   as   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of individual and team-based medical skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Military Medicine has implemented the use\r\n\r\nof Computer-Based Training (CBT) courseware in the CAI centre\r\n\r\nsince 1996.  Since then, more than 30 hours of computer-based\r\n\r\ntraining courseware were developed in-house and by commercial\r\n\r\nvendors.   Our approach is to source and acquire commercially\r\n\r\navailable  software packages to provide professional  medical\r\n\r\nknowledge  and training, while developing packages  for  SAF-specific  medical operations systems and team-based  training\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF Medical Corps recognises the usefulness of\r\n\r\nsimulators  for  enhancing  the  realism  and  efficiency  of\r\n\r\nmedical  skills  training.  The medical  simulators  used  in\r\n\r\ntraining  for  individual  technical  skills  include  simple\r\n\r\nanatomical models and intravenous infusion trainers  for  use\r\n\r\nby medics, and more complex models for training in in-patient\r\n\r\nintubation.   A  variety  of  full-size  and  weighted  human\r\n\r\nmannequins,  to simulate the weight of the real patient,  are\r\n\r\nalso now extensively used to simulate casualties during field\r\n\r\ntraining of medical units.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The School of Military Medicine has also procured six\r\n\r\nsets of advanced patient simulators, what we call the SMM-MAN\r\n\r\nthis year.  These have just been procured and they are state-of-the-art  simulators (mannequins).  These  full-size  human\r\n\r\nmodels  are  equipped  with  sophisticated  components   that\r\n\r\nsimulate  clinical signs and symptoms, and they are  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide  highly realistic training for a variety  of  medical\r\n\r\nconditions.   The  mannequins allow the trainees,  medics  as\r\n\r\nwell   as   the   doctors,   to  perform   specific   medical\r\n\r\ninterventions,  and  these  mannequins  provide   real   time\r\n\r\nfeedback  for the trainees through a change in the  patients'\r\n\r\nclinical parameters, and these parameters can be observed  on\r\n\r\na  monitor.   These simulators are presently  being  used  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  high degree of realism in our paramedic  level  3\r\n\r\ntraining and advanced trauma life-support courses.  In  time,\r\n\r\nwe  will  provide  these  courses  to  our  NS  medics.   Our\r\n\r\nintention  is to continue extending the employment  of  these\r\n\r\nsimulators  for the medical team training as we gain  further\r\n\r\nexperience in their use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked the Chief Medical Officer to host a visit\r\n\r\nfor  the  GPC  members to take a look at how  the  School  of\r\n\r\nMilitary Medicine incorporates CAI and CBT courseware in  the\r\n\r\ntraining of doctors and medics.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee, would you like to withdraw your\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> I thank Prof. Koo for his comprehensive\r\n\r\nanswer, and I thank him for his invitation to visit the  unit\r\n\r\nconcerned.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> The recent spate of\r\n\r\nterrorist  activities  in  the world  and  the  detention  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans suspected of terrorist activities last  December\r\n\r\nunderscore the critical importance of having strong  homeland\r\n\r\nsecurity measures.  Our home, in such a case, is actually the\r\n\r\nfrontline  when  we  deal with terrorism.   The  dangers  are\r\n\r\nenormous and the damage can be catastrophic, as was the  case\r\n\r\nwe   have  seen  in  the  September  11  incidents.    I   am\r\n\r\nparticularly  relieved, and I am sure  that  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic will also be very reassured, that the Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs and, in particular, the Internal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity  Department,  had  been able  to  identify  would-be\r\n\r\nterrorists,  and to stem the danger before such  an  incident\r\n\r\ncould arise.  I think this is a particularly reassuring thing\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the recent December 2001 detentions of\r\n\r\nterrorists,  it  is quite clear that ISD has been  doing  its\r\n\r\njob.  I believe they were monitoring the potential terrorists\r\n\r\nfor some time before they were forced to take action, due  to\r\n\r\nthe  imminent dangers that they were causing.  So I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry of Home Affairs will be able to assure  the\r\n\r\npublic  that this level of surveillance, in fact, an enhanced\r\n\r\nlevel of surveillance, will continue.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  terrorist  attacks, if they  do  take  place  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, would be felt much more strongly in such  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry  and  with  so  many vulnerable  places  packed  with\r\n\r\npeople.   And, now, since terrorist activities take  so  many\r\n\r\nforms,  we  basically  have  to  take  extra  precautions  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  interest and security of our  people.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure,  today, the public would like to know how the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Home Affairs, together with agencies, intend to protect us\r\n\r\nfrom terrorist attacks.\r\n\r\n<br>6.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at least four areas relating to homeland\r\n\r\nsecurity that I would like to touch on.  First, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister whether the Ministry, together with  the\r\n\r\nother  departments, is prepared for any terrorist  who  might\r\n\r\nwant to use biological agents to attack us.  Do we, first  of\r\n\r\nall,  have  the  expertise  and,  secondly,  have  sufficient\r\n\r\nmedical  supplies  to respond to such an  attack?   Have  any\r\n\r\nstudies  been  done  so far, for example,  of  what  sort  of\r\n\r\nmedical  needs will be required, in a big bomb explosion,  an\r\n\r\nanthrax attack or something of that type?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of security measure in homeland security\r\n\r\nis,  of  course, the border and port security.  Now, with  an\r\n\r\nenormous  number  of people moving in and  out,  particularly\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Causeway  everyday,  how  vigilant  are  we  in\r\n\r\nequipping our border police and port\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecurity   in  determining  whether  or  not  such  terrorist\r\n\r\nsuspects are coming in?  Are we confident that we can keep an\r\n\r\neye on such people?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is environmental and energy security. We\r\n\r\nknow that the Government has, of course, done a good job over\r\n\r\nthe  years  to  safeguard  important installations,  such  as\r\n\r\ntelecommunications networks and so on.  But, naturally, power\r\n\r\nstations,  etc, would also be targets for terrorist  attacks,\r\n\r\nand  I am sure that there are plans in place to protect  such\r\n\r\nvital  installations.  My question is not so much in relation\r\n\r\nto  physical  facilities that I am interested in.   I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether   we   have  measures  in  place  to  safeguard,   in\r\n\r\nparticular, sensitive electronic information, such as in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  sector and other forms of information  of  digital\r\n\r\ncommunications  of MINDEF and MHA, whether these  are  secure\r\n\r\nfrom  terrorist attacks through the Internet or  through  the\r\n\r\nuse of computer viruses and so on.  Are we confident that  we\r\n\r\ncan  be sure that such terrorist attacks would not bring  the\r\n\r\nwhole digital networks of vital installations down?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second cut relates to the role of the community in\r\n\r\nhomeland security.  I think there is no question that without\r\n\r\nthe  participation,  without the  consciousness  of  all  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public in Singapore, we cannot have  a  high\r\n\r\ndegree  of homeland security, no matter how hard the security\r\n\r\nforces  can  try.   The  demands  of  homeland  security  are\r\n\r\nincreasing,  due to the current development  in  this  world.\r\n\r\nThe  primary question I want to ask in this respect is:  will\r\n\r\nthe Minister tell us how the community can play a more active\r\n\r\nrole in combating terrorism and crime?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to mention that in the World War II, we\r\n\r\nhave  heard  of  homeland security groups  in  a  variety  of\r\n\r\ncountries.   In  England,  they  were  partly  satisfied   by\r\n\r\nsomething  called the \"Dad's Army\", that is to say  that  for\r\n\r\nmen  and women who cannot participate at the frontline,  they\r\n\r\nwould   stay   at   home   to  man  security   installations,\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  watch groups and so on.  I think  it  is  high\r\n\r\ntime that, in Singapore, we had a dedicated volunteer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforce,  maybe a citizen corps, to be trained and  to  provide\r\n\r\nimmediate  assistance to major disasters caused by  terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks.   If the majority of men are already engaged  in  NS\r\n\r\nduties,  may  I  respectfully suggest that we  encourage  our\r\n\r\nwomen folk to do their national service in this way and  play\r\n\r\na more active role in the defence of the nation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this type of citizen force can be created, we hope\r\n\r\nthat  they will play supporting roles, like being trained  as\r\n\r\nparamedics,  for  example, to administer  drugs,  to  perform\r\n\r\nfirst  aid  in  times  of  crisis.  Volunteers  may  also  be\r\n\r\nenlisted to help play an important role in instilling  public\r\n\r\nawareness  and  educating the public  on  the  management  of\r\n\r\nemergency situations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, many of them have already joined the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood   watch   groups  to   report   on   suspicious\r\n\r\nactivities, but I think we can do more.  Many of us  live  in\r\n\r\nfear  of terrorism.  However, part of the fear is created  by\r\n\r\nthe  fact that we do not know what sort of dangers or in what\r\n\r\nform  terrorism can come.  It is very important that we  have\r\n\r\nsome  form of public education, so that members of the public\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  taken unawares and will know how to  react  in\r\n\r\ntimes of emergency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to say this. I believe that\r\n\r\nhomeland    security   requires   a   highly    sophisticated\r\n\r\nintelligence  network, not only through  intelligence  agents\r\n\r\ncollecting  information or high-tech intelligence  gathering,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am sure is done by the professional services.   But\r\n\r\nmore  often than not, it is public giving information on what\r\n\r\nthey  regard as suspicious activities.  I think that will  be\r\n\r\nthe  key to helping us combat terrorist activities.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  I also hope that this sort of citizen force will  be\r\n\r\ntrained in basic skills and recognising suspicious characters\r\n\r\nor recognising something out of the ordinary among neighbours\r\n\r\nor  whatever.   I do not mean to encourage a vigilante  force\r\n\r\nwhich would give rise to a lot of complaints about neighbours\r\n\r\nand so on.  I do not mean that.  But I do mean that we need a\r\n\r\nbit  more education for our citizens to understand that there\r\n\r\nmay be situations where they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  feel  that there are some danger involved  in  certain\r\n\r\nactivities, and they would be prepared to report this to  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  authorities.   As  an  example  of  this  type   of\r\n\r\nreporting, I must say that I was very impressed with the fact\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  United States, for example, now  they  have  a\r\n\r\nwebsite where one can actually put in information for the use\r\n\r\nof  intelligence services, so that the intelligence  services\r\n\r\ncan then follow up to see whether there are dangers involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will clarify whether such a force\r\n\r\ncan  be  useful in combating terrorism and also in  enhancing\r\n\r\nhomeland security.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Madam, first of all, I would like to\r\n\r\nstart   off  by  paying  tribute  to  the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nDepartment for its fine work in breaking up the plot  by  the\r\n\r\n13 terrorists last December.  I think it would have certainly\r\n\r\nbeen a terrible disaster for Singapore if the terrorists  had\r\n\r\ngotten  their way.  The unveiling of the plot has brought  to\r\n\r\nthe surface a new kind of threat to our country, and that  is\r\n\r\nwhy  I call it an unconventional threat.  Previously, we have\r\n\r\nbeen  prepared for different kinds of disasters.  I  remember\r\n\r\nthat   we   have  also  run  exercises,  simulated  emergency\r\n\r\nsituations and our community is generally quite well-prepared\r\n\r\nto deal with any incident that may arise.  But terrorism is a\r\n\r\ndifferent thing.  It is a different kind of threat to us  and\r\n\r\nI  would like to know what steps the Ministry of Home Affairs\r\n\r\nhas in place to mobilise the community in case a disaster  of\r\n\r\nthis nature should occur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read that the Ministry has in place a committee called\r\n\r\nthe  National  Emergency System (NEST).   I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to provide us with more details as to what  NEST  is\r\n\r\ndoing,  how  it  intends  to educate the  population  of  the\r\n\r\ndangers of unconventional threats, and to what extent can the\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders and the community be involved  in  dealing\r\n\r\nwith a situation that may arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Chairman, I intended to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister whether our Home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeam  has the capability and is prepared to address chemical,\r\n\r\nbiological  and  other  conventional threats.   However,  the\r\n\r\nSenior Minister of State, in an answer to a Question for Oral\r\n\r\nAnswer earlier this week, had already told the House that the\r\n\r\nHome  Team has the capability and is prepared to address  any\r\n\r\nunconventional threats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would just like to ask what measures have\r\n\r\nbeen taken or are being planned to prepare the population  in\r\n\r\nthe  form of public education or national exercise on how  to\r\n\r\nreact in the event of a chemical or biological incident.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Madam, I had intended to ask the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  how  the  Home  Team  intends  to  involve  the\r\n\r\ncommunity   more   directly  in  exercises   in   connection,\r\n\r\nespecially  with  the preparation to tackle  the  threats  of\r\n\r\nterrorism.  I want to say that the Senior Minister of  State,\r\n\r\nin  reply  to an Oral Question raised in an earlier  session,\r\n\r\nhad  addressed some of those concerns.  I would just like  to\r\n\r\necho  the questions raised by my colleagues earlier  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject, and I look forward to more details being provided.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yatiman, you have three minutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Madam, I would like to join my colleagues in\r\n\r\nexpressing  our gratitude to the Internal Security Department\r\n\r\nin  handling the JI incident in Singapore and the  threat  of\r\n\r\nterrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent arrests of the JI members in Singapore have\r\n\r\nproven  that  Singapore is far from free from the  threat  of\r\n\r\nterrorism.   The  threat is global and  the  network  can  be\r\n\r\nregional or international, thus making the protection of  our\r\n\r\nhome  ground  even  more  complicated  and  difficult.    For\r\n\r\nSingapore,  unlike other countries with no  hinterland,  with\r\n\r\nhigh concentration of population in an urban area, the threat\r\n\r\nof  terrorism  is  real  and can be devastating.   We  cannot\r\n\r\nimagine  if a bomb planted in Yishun MRT station did explode,\r\n\r\nyou can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncalculate  the extent of injuries, fear and devastation,  not\r\n\r\nonly  to  the community in that area, but to the security  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as well as our image as a country  that  is  free\r\n\r\nfrom threat of terrorism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, we have to be more vigilant because the\r\n\r\nnetwork  of  terrorism is well embedded in this  region.   As\r\n\r\nMembers  are  aware, Abu Sayyaf is a growing  threat  in  the\r\n\r\nsouthern  Philippines,  Al Mauna, KMM,  JI  Malaysia,  Laskar\r\n\r\nJihad  in  Indonesia, Jemaah Islamiyah - they all  form  into\r\n\r\nnetworks  that can reach Singapore one day.  My question  is:\r\n\r\nhow  could our security agencies prevent Singapore from being\r\n\r\nthe   target  of  such  threats,  and  how  could  we  ensure\r\n\r\ninvestors,  tourists and, most important, Singaporeans,  that\r\n\r\nsuch threat will not be a reality here?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
