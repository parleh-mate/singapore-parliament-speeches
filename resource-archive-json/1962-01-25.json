Where there are two or more unions  claiming\r\n\r\nrepresentation for the same group of  employees  and\r\n\r\nthe  matter cannot be resolved in any other  way,  a\r\n\r\nsecret ballot can then be taken with the consent  of\r\n\r\nthe  unions concerned. The Singapore Government  has\r\n\r\ncarried on and is carrying on negotiations with  the\r\n\r\nunions  affiliated  to the Singapore  Federation  of\r\n\r\nUnions  of  Government  Employees.  No  question  of\r\n\r\nrecognition  therefore arises. A  secret  ballot  on\r\n\r\nwhich union is to represent which grade of employees\r\n\r\ndoes not, therefore, arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, would the Minister agree that\r\n\r\nrivalry  between these two unions for membership  of\r\n\r\nGovernment   employees   is   unhealthy?   For   the\r\n\r\nunification of the trade union movement in the civil\r\n\r\nservice,  does  he  not consider it  appropriate  to\r\n\r\naccede to the request of the Federation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is\r\n\r\nrivalry  not only between unions affiliated  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  hut also between member unions  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  themselves. For instance, a stenographer\r\n\r\nemployed  in  the  Broadcasting  Division   of   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Culture is eligible for membership  and\r\n\r\ncan  be  represented  by one of  three  unions -   the Singapore  Government  Administrative  and  Clerical Services  Union,  the  Singapore  Secretarial  Staff Union, and the Department of Broadcasting Employees' Union. I think in these matters, Sir, it is best  to leave  questions of representation and  negotiations\r\n\r\nto the employees and their unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, could\r\n\r\nI  have a reply to my question?

One of the  requests  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  is  that if they should win  the  secret\r\n\r\nballot, then they ask the Government to require  the\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E. to amend its rules so that they would  not\r\n\r\nbe  able to recruit Government employees. This  same\r\n\r\nrequest  was made by the Federation of City  Council\r\n\r\nLabour Unions during the last strike, and we pointed\r\n\r\nout  quite clearly to them that it is not within the\r\n\r\npower  of  the  Government to require any  union  to\r\n\r\namend its laws in the way that the Government thinks\r\n\r\nfit.  Therefore, whether or not a secret  ballot  is\r\n\r\ncarried   out,   whether  or  not   the   Government\r\n\r\nrecognises  one  union  or  the  other,  the  unions\r\n\r\nconcerned  will continue to exist, will continue  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  members, and will continue to compete  with\r\n\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The problem only rises when we\r\n\r\nrefuse recognition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The problem arises only, when as\r\n\r\nI  have mentioned before, we refuse recognition to a\r\n\r\nparticular union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONSUMPTION FIGURES OF PETROLEUM FOR 1961 AND 1960</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMPARED WITH 1959, 1958 AND 1957</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following question stood in the name of Mr\r\n\r\nDavid Marshall -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*  To  ask  the Minister for Finance what  are  the\r\n\r\nconsumption figures of petroleum for the years  1961\r\n\r\nand  1960 compared with figures for the years  1959,\r\n\r\n1958 and 1957.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Marshall, Question No. 2*.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I have since ascertained the\r\n\r\ninformation  I  sought  in  Question  No.  2*,  Mr Speaker.

This has  enabled\r\n\r\nthe  Water  Department temporarily to lift rationing\r\n\r\nand  to supply our total consumer needs solely  from\r\n\r\nour   Singapore  Reservoirs.  This  will  also  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the Singapore rains while  conserving\r\n\r\nstocks in our Johore Reservoirs which are still  low\r\n\r\nbecause  there were no correspondingly  heavy  rains\r\n\r\nthere in the last fortnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the general situation of our total stocks\r\n\r\nis  not altogether satisfactory.

Before concluding, I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  Barisan Sosialis had  one  failing,\r\n\r\ni.e., they are unable to distinguish clearly who are\r\n\r\nthe  colonialists and who are the nationalists.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  think that the  nationalists  are\r\n\r\nalso  colonialists.  They are confused  between  the\r\n\r\ntwo. That is why their position is isolated today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have another\r\n\r\nfailing, i.e., they are shortsighted. They  try  all\r\n\r\nways  and  means  to  attack the nationalists   - even\r\n\r\nharder   than   the  attack  they   level   at   the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.  This is a very great  shortcoming  of\r\n\r\ntheirs. They hope that the nationalists will come to\r\n\r\na   united  front  with  them.  But  they  stab  the\r\n\r\nnationalists  behind their backs. For  example,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown  said  yesterday  that   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya is attracted to  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nplan because perhaps of the oil resources in Brunei,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  revenue  is high. In fact,  the  revenue\r\n\r\nthere  exceeds expenditure so much that there  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat surplus of money which will be helpful to the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya. According to  him,  this  is\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  only  true appeal  that  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nconcept has for the Federation of Malaya. This  talk\r\n\r\nis  very bad because he is trying to treat the Tunku\r\n\r\nas  an  exploiter.  He tried to say  that  when  two\r\n\r\ncountries   wish  to  merge,  it  is   a   case   of\r\n\r\nexploitation of one by the other. This kind of  talk\r\n\r\nwill  only  further separate the people of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories. It will not bring peace to the  people:\r\n\r\ninstead  it  will bring disaster. We in  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  a  different concept of Malaysia than that  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis. We take into consideration the\r\n\r\ninterest of the broad masses of the people. But  the\r\n\r\nattitude'  of the Barisan Sosialis towards  Malaysia\r\n\r\nis in the interest of the colonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the Barisan Sosialis are in\r\n\r\nsuch a position that they are surrounded by enemies.\r\n\r\nThey  hope to be able to defeat the P.A.P. in  order\r\n\r\nto  gain power so that they can collaborate with the\r\n\r\nBritish colonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown raised three points\r\n\r\nyesterday  in his speech with regard to the  British\r\n\r\ncolonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  was reported in the Sin Chew Jit Poh. He  said\r\n\r\nthe question confronting us is not merely to get rid\r\n\r\nof  the  British. I think the people will understand\r\n\r\ntheir  hidden  intention behind this  statement.  He\r\n\r\ncontinued to say - as is reported in the Sin Chew  Jit\r\n\r\nPoh - that  the British hoped that the people  of  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories would be divided and fight  among\r\n\r\nthemselves,  with  the  result  that  the   colonial\r\n\r\ninfluence would be forgotten for the time  being  by\r\n\r\nthem.  At  the  beginning the Barisan Sosialis  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  question of the British  colonialists  no\r\n\r\nlonger exists. The second point they raised was that\r\n\r\nit  is  the hope of the British to divide the people\r\n\r\nof the Borneo territories. This kind of talk is very\r\n\r\ninconsistent.  The P.A.P. want to  merge  all  these\r\n\r\nterritories into a very strong Malaysian nation, but\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis say that it is the intention of\r\n\r\nthe   British   to  divide  the  people   in   these\r\n\r\nterritories.  If this is so, how can they  say  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are trying to sell out the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe people in this region? As far as we can see, the\r\n\r\nleaders  of the Barisan Sosialis are suffering  from\r\n\r\nshortsightedness.  They  seem  to  be  standing   on\r\n\r\nClifford Pier from where they can see monkeys coming\r\n\r\nacross the sea from Indonesia. They then run quickly\r\n\r\nto Geylang Serai to say that the enemies are landing\r\n\r\nand  that the Dutch military forces are slaughtering\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian people. They are trying to  describe\r\n\r\nthe present situation in Indonesia as a very serious\r\n\r\nsituation in order to agitate innocent womenfolk  to\r\n\r\ngo  to the battlefield in Indonesia. The leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis are just keeping quiet. Instead\r\n\r\nof doing something, they are shouting slogans on the\r\n\r\nstage.  Such  an attitude is incompatible  with  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I can see today that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are  suffering from a very great  mistake.\r\n\r\nThey  have many theories and many slogans, but these\r\n\r\nare at variance with the dialectical materialism  of\r\n\r\nKarl  Marx. We know that in the view of Marx, resort\r\n\r\nmust  be  made to practical moves. The understanding\r\n\r\nof   the   human   being  is  very  important.

The  leaders  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  only  know  how to shout  slogans  on  the\r\n\r\nstage.

They went to Geylang Serai in order  to\r\n\r\nget the support of the Malays there. They appear  to\r\n\r\nbe friends of the Malays. They wish to appear to the\r\n\r\nMalays  that  they  are  very  courageous  in  their\r\n\r\nstruggle  against colonialism. They try to create  a\r\n\r\nfalse impression in the minds of the Malays. On  the\r\n\r\none  hand, they try to get the support of the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the Federation, but, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nthey  attack him in many ways. They treat the Malays\r\n\r\nin   the  Federation  in  the  same  way  that   the\r\n\r\nManchurians tried to conquer China. This will  widen\r\n\r\nthe  gulf  between the people of Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation with no benefit to them. For example,  in\r\n\r\nthe speeches of the Member for Queenstown, stress is\r\n\r\noften  laid on the fact that Singapore and the other\r\n\r\nterritories should merge with Indonesia.  But  their\r\n\r\nreal  intention  is  not  a reunification  of  these\r\n\r\nterritories  with Indonesia because they  understand\r\n\r\nthat the present ruler of Indonesia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis   President  Soekarno.

This  appears  on  the\r\n\r\nfifth page of the Sin Chew Jit Poh: of yesterday:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As socialists, we are in support of more and more\r\n\r\npeople  in  various countries uniting  together.

These  Communist  front\r\n\r\norganisations went even so far as to  say  that  the\r\n\r\nTunku  had  connived with the British in  presenting\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, Sir, events have proved to the\r\n\r\ncontrary.   The  Malaysia  Solidarity   Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittee   in  their  deliberations  in  Jesselton,\r\n\r\nKuching and Kuala Lumpur, have in no uncertain terms\r\n\r\nbared the falsehoods and lies of the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British colonialism is on its last legs in this\r\n\r\npart of the world. It is on the way out. The British\r\n\r\nknow it, the Communists know it, and we know it.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, we all know that with the departure\r\n\r\nof the British colonial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npower,  there will be left a vacuum in this  region.\r\n\r\nThe  Communists and their allies, with their  tongue\r\n\r\nin  their  cheek,  say that it  will  be  filled  by\r\n\r\nanother form of colonialism - the colonialism  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is hardly necessary for me to say that\r\n\r\nneither the Tunku nor his erstwhile colleagues  have\r\n\r\nany territorial ambitions. However, we who belong to\r\n\r\nthe  democratic forces have no doubts in  our  minds\r\n\r\nthat  unless  something is done - and done  quickly - to\r\n\r\nfill  this  vacuum, the Communists  will  get  there\r\n\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight for Malaysia is a fight against time. It\r\n\r\nis a fight for the survival of democracy against the\r\n\r\nevil   forces   of   Communist   dictatorship.   The\r\n\r\nCommunists are no fools. They are aware of it.  That\r\n\r\nis why they are using every means in their power, by\r\n\r\ninfiltration, intimidation and persuasion, to  wreck\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysia Plan. They are fighting for time  too.\r\n\r\nThey are not ready to take over now but they hope to\r\n\r\ndo   so  as  soon  as  they  have  marshalled  their\r\n\r\nCommunist  front organisations and  dupes  in  these\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not say that the Communists are the only\r\n\r\nforces  which  are against Malaysia, but  I  dc  say\r\n\r\nthis, that they are the biggest force with which the\r\n\r\npeople of Malaysia will have to contend. Even in the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories, the leaders there have  a  fair\r\n\r\nidea  of  what  will  happen  to  them  should   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  succeed.  In  fact,  the  few  who   are\r\n\r\napprehensive about Malaysia are those who fear  that\r\n\r\nwith  the coming of Malaysia the Communist front  in\r\n\r\nSingapore will infiltrate into their territories and\r\n\r\nmake life a misery for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the fears expressed and it is a very\r\n\r\ngenuine   one.  For  this  very  reason,  Sir,   the\r\n\r\nTemanggong Juga of Iban and other leaders from Sabah\r\n\r\nand  Sarawak insisted that they would very much like\r\n\r\nto  control  migration in the respective territories\r\n\r\nafter  Malaysia,  The people of  Sabah,  Brunei  and\r\n\r\nSarawak  are fully aware of the dangers of Communism\r\n\r\nand Communist infiltration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey know that for them to survive there is no\r\n\r\nother alternative but to join hands with their  kith\r\n\r\nand  kin  in  Malaya  and  Singapore  in  a  greater\r\n\r\nfederation  and  together  unfold  a  new   era   of\r\n\r\nprosperity and happiness for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like now to touch on some\r\n\r\nof  the  points raised by the leader of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   in  his  speech  yesterday.  Merger   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia mean an enslavement of the people  and  the\r\n\r\nspread  of  injustice and inequality,  so  said  the\r\n\r\nleader  of the Barisan Sosialis. Sir, [do  not  know\r\n\r\nhow  the Member has arrived, at this conclusion.  If\r\n\r\nhe  had  taken the Federation of Malaya today  as  a\r\n\r\nguide for the things to come in the future Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthen he is completely wrong. And it is a mischievous\r\n\r\nand  a misleading statement to make. Malaya has been\r\n\r\nindependent  for nearly 4\u00bd years. It has  proved  to\r\n\r\nthe world that amongst the new nations in post World\r\n\r\nWar  II it .is a shining example of a country  where\r\n\r\njustice,  equality, and freedom  of  the  individual\r\n\r\nprevail.  Malaya has not reached the stage and  will\r\n\r\nnot   reach  the  stage  of  some  countries   where\r\n\r\npolitical  opponents are just lugged into prison  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy the whims of the ruling Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about enslavement, injustice and\r\n\r\ninequality,  the  Member for  Thomson,  who  was  my\r\n\r\nfellow  traveller  to the Kuching  conference,  will\r\n\r\ncertainly bear me out when I say that in the  Borneo\r\n\r\nStates  the  ra'ayat,  particularly  the  indigenous\r\n\r\npeople, have not had a square deal from the colonial\r\n\r\nregime.  Injustice, inequality, and enslavement  are\r\n\r\nphases  which  could  be applied  to  the  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  in some of the Borneo territories. Colonial\r\n\r\npower  which came to Sarawak in 1941, in  Brunei  in\r\n\r\n1888, and in Sabah in 1878, had done very little  to\r\n\r\nuplift  the  standard of living  of  the  indigenous\r\n\r\npeople.  When  the  British first  went  there,  the\r\n\r\nDayaks,  the  Ibans,  the Malays,  the  Muruts,  the\r\n\r\nBajaus, the Melanaus, the Dusuns, were all living in\r\n\r\nattap  huts.  Today, Sir, after decades of  colonial\r\n\r\nadministration applied to the people,  they  are  no\r\n\r\nbetter.  So, when the leader of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\ntalks of injustice,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninequality, and enslavement in the future  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nhe  should,  first  of all, take  a  peep  into  the\r\n\r\nconditions that prevail in the Borneo States. I know\r\n\r\nhe  has been there, Sir, but perhaps he has not used\r\n\r\nhis eyes wisely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Malaysia, says the Barisan leader, would\r\n\r\nmean  the transfer of power from the British to  the\r\n\r\nFederation  with the British the back-seat  drivers.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  do  not see the logic of this argument.  We\r\n\r\nhave  repeatedly said in this House  - and so has  the\r\n\r\nTunku  elsewhere - that  Malaysia,  like  the  present\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya,  will  be  a  free  and   an\r\n\r\nindependent  country.  There will  be  no  back-seat\r\n\r\ndrivers. All the drivers in the future Malaysia will\r\n\r\ncome  from  the  people of Malaysia, and  they  will\r\n\r\noccupy  front  seats, except perhaps the  Communists\r\n\r\nwho  in an open conflict with the nationalist forces\r\n\r\nwould prefer to remain back-seat drivers and let the\r\n\r\nstooges do the fighting for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point has also been raised, within the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  this argument, of the story of  nuclear\r\n\r\nweapons  in  Singapore and the defence  treaty  with\r\n\r\nBritain,   and   how   these   arrangements    would\r\n\r\nautomatically place the population in the front line\r\n\r\nin  any  nuclear war. I myself do not  know  whether\r\n\r\nthere  are nuclear weapons stored in Singapore.  But\r\n\r\nlet  me tell the Barisan leader and his friends that\r\n\r\nin  the  event  of  a nuclear war erupting  in  this\r\n\r\nregion, the front line would not be confined to  the\r\n\r\npopulation  of Singapore alone, but the whole  world\r\n\r\nwould be involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, mud-slinging and smearing are all effective\r\n\r\nweapons for those who have no argument left. And  so\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis leaders, having come to the end\r\n\r\nof  their  resources,  now  indulge  in  this  dirty\r\n\r\npastime. The Tunku says that their leader, that  is,\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown, has a pathological  fear\r\n\r\nof  the  Chinese  in Singapore,  and  hence  he  has\r\n\r\ncategorically   stated  that  he  would   not   have\r\n\r\nSingapore  without  the Borneo States.  The  reason,\r\n\r\naccording to the Barisan, is the desire of the Tunku\r\n\r\nto  have  a  preponderance of the indigenous  people\r\n\r\nover the Chinese. In fact, Sir, this statement is an\r\n\r\naccusation that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTunku  is anti-Chinese. Now, nothing can be  further\r\n\r\nfrom  the truth. My friend and colleague, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill, has already dealt with this point and\r\n\r\nI will not elaborate on it. But let me say this, and\r\n\r\nlet me explain, if an explanation is needed, why the\r\n\r\nTunku  made  that statement. It is  not  because  he\r\n\r\nfears  the  preponderance of the Chinese. Even  with\r\n\r\nthe Borneo territories thrown in, the proportion  of\r\n\r\nracial  representation in Malaysia would be  42  per\r\n\r\ncent indigenous, which would include the Malays,  38\r\n\r\nper   cent   Chinese,  10  per  cent   Indians   and\r\n\r\nPakistanis, and 10 per cent others. Sir, knowing the\r\n\r\nspeed  of  propagation of our Chinese  brothers  and\r\n\r\nsisters,  I  think it would not be long before  they\r\n\r\ncatch  up with the Malays and even beat them. If  we\r\n\r\nare  to fight Communism in Malaysia, we cannot fight\r\n\r\nthem  in pockets. The problem must be tackled  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.   Just   as  Malaysia  without   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories  cannot work; so also  Malaysia  without\r\n\r\nSingapore cannot be effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, let me once again say to the Barisan boys:\r\n\r\nour Tunku is not anti-Chinese, nor is he communal in\r\n\r\nhis  attitude  towards  the  basic  problems  facing\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  But  it is obvious to all that  the  very\r\n\r\nfact  that  the Barisan has chosen to propound  this\r\n\r\nline of argument only goes to prove the strength  of\r\n\r\nChinese  chauvinism that permeates  and  guides  the\r\n\r\nthoughts and minds of the Barisan leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown, Sir, has also laboured\r\n\r\nat  great length on the apprehensions of the  people\r\n\r\nof  Borneo  towards Malaysia. He  said  the  Sarawak\r\n\r\nUnited  People's  Party and  the  Party  Ra'ayat  of\r\n\r\nBrunei wanted self-determination first before having\r\n\r\nanything  to  do with Malaysia. Perhaps the  Barisan\r\n\r\nboys  can tell me who are the guiding lights of  the\r\n\r\nS.U.P.P. and who are their supporters, and from what\r\n\r\ngroup  do they come. Are the Party Ra'ayat  and  the\r\n\r\nS.U.P.P. the only political Parties in  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nStates? Does the Member for Queenstown know  or  has\r\n\r\nhe  heard  of  the Brunei United Party,  the  Brunei\r\n\r\nNational Organisation -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

So  let  me\r\n\r\nadvise  the  Barisan  Members,  when  they  talk  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in  the context of the Borneo  territories - let   them  not  forget  that  the  Sarawak  United\r\n\r\nPeople's  Party is not the only political  Party  in\r\n\r\nSarawak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on West Irian, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Thomson had occasion to mention the  conception\r\n\r\nof  Greater  Malaysia which would include Indonesia,\r\n\r\nthe  Philippines, the Borneo States,  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaya.

Are they trying to  delude  the\r\n\r\npeople  into believing that they support this  idea?\r\n\r\nPerhaps. Sir, I should mention here that the Greater\r\n\r\nMalaysia  plan was first mooted in the early  1930s.\r\n\r\nThe  idea caught on until it came out in one of  the\r\n\r\nplatforms  of  the Malay National Party,  or  M.N.P.\r\n\r\nafter World War II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Point of clarification.

But do the Barisan really know the  primary\r\n\r\nobjective   of  the  conception  of  this  so-called\r\n\r\nGreater  Malaysia? I will tell you, Sir,It  was  an\r\n\r\nanti-Chinese move. It was a move which emanated from\r\n\r\ncertain  national  leaders in  South-East  Asia  who\r\n\r\nfeared  the  insurgence of Chinese in the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nworld.  Sir,  had  they known about  this  so-called\r\n\r\nGreater Malaysia, I am sure the idea would not be as\r\n\r\nattractive  to them now as it was before.

Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  before  I  come  to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\ngnashing  of  teeth  and  breast-beating  that   the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis have indulged in on the  question\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia,  I  think it is necessary  for  me  to\r\n\r\noutline the case for Malaysia insofar as it concerns\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary  people.  The  Barisan  Sosialis  have\r\n\r\ntalked a great deal about Malaysia, either from  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  view of this or that political  Party  or\r\n\r\nleader.  We  have  talked of Malaysia  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nideologies - freedom    versus    despotism,     anti-colonialism  versus  imperialism,  democracy  versus\r\n\r\nautocracy,  socialism versus communism, and  so  on.\r\n\r\nSir, I am not saying that these different ideologies\r\n\r\nare not relevant to the issue of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in our preoccupation with the\r\n\r\nideological  and political aspects of  Malaysia,  in\r\n\r\nour  preoccupation  with party  interests,  we  have\r\n\r\nperhaps not laid enough stress on why the problem of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  important to the 10  million  ordinary\r\n\r\npeople who will comprise it. They are not interested\r\n\r\nin  these  problems. They want to know.  \"What  does\r\n\r\nMalaysia mean to me?\" Therefore, to the ordinary man\r\n\r\nin  Borneo,  Brunei, Sarawak, Singapore and  Malaya,\r\n\r\nthe  first question that will come to his  mind  and\r\n\r\nthe  first  question that he will ask is, \"Why  have\r\n\r\nMalaysia'? Why cannot we go on as we have  done  for\r\n\r\nmany  decades?\" He will ask, \"What do I get  out  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia?\" Then the next question he will ask - he  is\r\n\r\nthe  man who has to decide whether Malaysia is  good\r\n\r\nor  bad  for  him - is:  \"In what  way  will  Malaysia\r\n\r\nbenefit me?\" The ordinary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nman  who  has  to look for a job and  care  for  his\r\n\r\nfamily, will ask, \"In what way will Malaysia benefit\r\n\r\nme,  my  wife and my children?\" He will ask,  \"Would\r\n\r\nlife be better off or worse off for me and my family\r\n\r\nif  there  were no Malaysia?\" It is important,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  throughout the discussion  - we  will  later  on\r\n\r\ncome  to  the ideological aspect - not to forget  this\r\n\r\naspect  of  the matter  - what Malaysia means  to  the\r\n\r\nordinary man. In what way is it going to affect  his\r\n\r\nlife,  for  better or for worse?  If  we  keep  that\r\n\r\nviewpoint  in mind all the time, then much  of  this\r\n\r\nideological  and other discourses  will  be  put  in\r\n\r\ntheir proper perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can show that Malaysia is inevitable because\r\n\r\nit is desirable, and that the ordinary people - the 10\r\n\r\nmillion in the live territories - have much to gain in\r\n\r\nthe way of economic livelihood, political stability,\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  social progress under Malaysia,  then\r\n\r\nthe   opposition  to  Malaysia  voiced  on  whatever\r\n\r\ngrounds is really being done at the expense  of  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of 10 million people; that is to say, not\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties, not ideologies. The  stakes  are\r\n\r\nthe livelihood of 10 million people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, therefore, begin by attempting to answer\r\n\r\nthe  first question: \"Why have Malaysia'? Why cannot\r\n\r\nwe  go  on as we are?\" Sir, the first point to  note\r\n\r\nabout Malaysia is that it is not something which  we\r\n\r\nare  going to create out of thin air. Lots of us are\r\n\r\ntalking  about Malaysia as if it does not exist:  as\r\n\r\nif  we  are going to start from scratch. But I  say,\r\n\r\nSir, the basis for Malaysia already exists. Malaysia\r\n\r\nis not something which was built out of thin air. It\r\n\r\nexists.  It  has  already been  created  for  us  by\r\n\r\nBritish colonialism. The five States of Malaysia - the\r\n\r\nFederation,  Singapore.  Brunei,  Sabah  (or   North\r\n\r\nBorneo)  and  Sarawak  - have been run by the  British\r\n\r\nmore or less as an integrated trading, financial and\r\n\r\nadministrative  unit.  The  trade  of   these   five\r\n\r\nterritories is interdependent. That is important  to\r\n\r\nremember.  The prosperity of these five  territories\r\n\r\ntoday  is interdependent. For example, Sir, in 1960,\r\n\r\nsome 32 per cent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the total exports of these five territories were\r\n\r\nwith  one  another. That is, more than one-third  of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  of  these  five  territories  was  among\r\n\r\nthemselves. Similarly, Sir, some 32 per cent of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  imports were again from among members of  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  group.  So in so far as one-third  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  imports  and exports are concerned,  they  do\r\n\r\nexport  to  and  import from one  another.  To  that\r\n\r\nextent,  it is an interdependent economic  unit.  To\r\n\r\nthat  extent, Malaysia exists. In fact, Sir,  inter-trading is not only on a substantial scale but it is\r\n\r\nalso  an essential feature of their trading pattern.\r\n\r\nThese  close  trading links were maintained  by  the\r\n\r\nunifying administration of British colonialism. Even\r\n\r\nafter  the  grant of independence to the  Federation\r\n\r\nand  partial internal self-government to  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthese trade links have not been appreciably loosened\r\n\r\nbecause    the   Borneo   territories   are    still\r\n\r\nadministered  by the British. For example,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\n1960,  Singapore exported over $10 million worth  of\r\n\r\ngoods to North Borneo alone. So to that extent, Sir,\r\n\r\nMalaysia is not something we are going to create out\r\n\r\nof  thin  air. It exists. The problem is not whether\r\n\r\nwe  want  to create Malaysia but whether we wish  to\r\n\r\nretain  the interdependence which has been of mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit to all of these territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more important than trade is the unifying\r\n\r\ninfluence  of a common currency. Thanks to  a  sound\r\n\r\nfinancial  structure and monetary stability  in  the\r\n\r\nfive territories, the Straits dollar today enjoys  a\r\n\r\nprestige,   confidence  and  value  as   few   other\r\n\r\ncurrencies do in the whole of South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the iniquities of British colonialism, it\r\n\r\nhas  created  a unified trade and monetary  pattern.\r\n\r\nIntelligent nationalists, who are really  interested\r\n\r\nin  the fate of 10 million people  - 10 million people\r\n\r\nwhose   jobs   and   livelihood  depend   upon   the\r\n\r\ncontinuance of the interdependence both of trade and\r\n\r\na  unified currency  - and not interested in their own\r\n\r\npolitical  future and whether or not they are  going\r\n\r\nto  be the government, such intelligent nationalists\r\n\r\nand socialists should use this interdependence as  a\r\n\r\nbasis for building a more just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  equal society in Malaysia. If any one of us are\r\n\r\nreally  interested in the welfare and livelihood  of\r\n\r\nthese  10  million people, then we  should  maintain\r\n\r\nthis interdependence and use it to build and shape a\r\n\r\nmore just and equitable society that we all want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the liquidation of colonialism does not mean\r\n\r\nthe  liquidation  of  all the creations  of  Western\r\n\r\nimperialism  - all the things that Western imperialism\r\n\r\nbrought  in  its train, whether they  be  scientific\r\n\r\ntechniques,  health  and  social  welfare  measures,\r\n\r\nmodern   methods   of  economic   organisation   and\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   and   the   unification   of   pocket\r\n\r\nprincipalities  into  an  integrated   trading   and\r\n\r\nmonetary  pattern. When we talk of the inevitability\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia,  we  work on the assumption  that  the\r\n\r\nordinary man will not lose something to destroy  his\r\n\r\nown livelihood. That is the basis when we say it  is\r\n\r\ninevitable, because we believe that the  people  are\r\n\r\nnot  so stupid as to destroy something on which they\r\n\r\ndepend  for their livelihood and for their survival.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir,  the urge towards  Malaysia  arises\r\n\r\nfrom  the  realisation that in the  context  of  the\r\n\r\nAsian  revolution the British must pull out  of  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories as well as Singapore as colonial\r\n\r\noverlords.  That again is an inevitable  process  of\r\n\r\nhistory. Sooner or later, the British must pull out.\r\n\r\nIt  is  also inevitable that when the choice  comes,\r\n\r\nthe  10  million people, who are not  interested  in\r\n\r\nstanding for election either in Singapore or in  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  will say, \"How is this unified  trading\r\n\r\nand  monetary  structure to be  preserved  once  the\r\n\r\nBritish pull out the other unifying force? Who is to\r\n\r\nreplace that force?\" Therefore, Sib, the rising tide\r\n\r\nof anti-colonialism in this region makes the retreat\r\n\r\nof  British  colonialism inevitable and the  British\r\n\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Sir, only a few weeks ago the British\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister reminded his people that his country\r\n\r\nwas  no longer a first-class power and that it could\r\n\r\nno  longer  play the dominant role it  once  did  in\r\n\r\nworld  affairs.  Therefore, the indications  plainly\r\n\r\nare that whether she likes it or not Britain will be\r\n\r\nforced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   give  in  to  anti-colonial  pressure  in   the\r\n\r\nMalaysian region, including Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the problem for the 10 million ordinary\r\n\r\npeople  who are not interested in ideologies,  party\r\n\r\nconflicts, colonialism versus democracy, imperialism\r\n\r\nversus autocracy, is this. All they want to know  is\r\n\r\nhow  to  retain  the  unifying  influence  that  the\r\n\r\nBritish exerted in this region'? Who is to fill  the\r\n\r\nunifying  role  that  Britain once  played  in  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia  region? Or are we, as the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nhope  and  fight for, to break Malaysia into  small,\r\n\r\nisolated and contending units'? The consequences  of\r\n\r\nBalkanisation of Malaysia should be obvious to  even\r\n\r\nthe   meanest  of  intelligence,  the   meanest   of\r\n\r\nMarxists, whether they are Groucho Marxists or Harpo\r\n\r\nMarxists.  It  should ha obvious to  them  that  the\r\n\r\nBalkanisation   of   Malaysia  into   self-governing\r\n\r\nindependent units must inevitably mean the  break-up\r\n\r\nof  the  existing financial and trading  pattern  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   That  is  so  obvious  that  we   cannot\r\n\r\ntherefore  understand how the Barisan Sosialis  (not\r\n\r\nso long ago they were for Malaysia in principle, but\r\n\r\nyesterday it was quite clear they were out to  break\r\n\r\nup  Malaysia) propose to ensure to 10 million people\r\n\r\nthat   the  unifying  influence  which  the  British\r\n\r\nexerted  here  to  a common trading  policy,  and  a\r\n\r\ncommon economic pattern, is to be retained to ensure\r\n\r\ntheir economic survival. Balkanisation must mean the\r\n\r\ndislocation of trade between these territories  from\r\n\r\nwhose disastrous consequences none of the 10 million\r\n\r\npeople  can  escape. Once you break up  the  trading\r\n\r\npattern,   the  consequences  will  be   felt   from\r\n\r\nJesselton  to Kuala Lumpur. As independent  economic\r\n\r\nunits, each of these territories will enter a period\r\n\r\nof bitter economic and trade rivalry to ensure their\r\n\r\nsurvival.  Only  there can be no  survival  but  the\r\n\r\ngradual impoverishment and exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, as I shall show later, Sir, we submit\r\n\r\nthat  the Barisan Sosialis want such a situation  in\r\n\r\nthe  whole of the Borneo territories. Their exaction\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- impoverishment. Because that is the soil on which\r\n\r\nCommunism can flourish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  charge that the Barisan Sosialis are deliberately\r\n\r\nbringing about this situation knowing full well that\r\n\r\nthe  consequences  of  it would  mean  the  economic\r\n\r\nimpoverishment  and disruption of  thits  territory.\r\n\r\nThat  is  exactly what they want. I shall  show  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  they  want to break  up  and  balkanise\r\n\r\nMalaysia  to create a vast slum extending  from  the\r\n\r\nFederation  to  the  North Borneo  territories.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  Sir,  if we accept the contention  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis that Malaysia should be  thwarted,\r\n\r\nthat   instead  of  Malaysia  we  should  have  five\r\n\r\nindependent   territories,  self-determination   for\r\n\r\nthese  territories, what answer  have  they  to  the\r\n\r\nsimple day-to-day problems which will arise the  day\r\n\r\nthe five territories break up? What, for example, is\r\n\r\nto  happen  to the single currency system  that  now\r\n\r\nobtains  when independence comes to these countries?\r\n\r\nIf there are going to be independent territories, is\r\n\r\nit suggested that each of these States - North Borneo,\r\n\r\nBrunei, Sarawak, Singapore and the Federation - should\r\n\r\neach  issue their own currency and follow their  own\r\n\r\nmonetary policies? If that is the case, what then is\r\n\r\nto  happen  to  the Straits dollar which  is  highly\r\n\r\nvalued  throughout South-East Asia? It  is  more  or\r\n\r\nless  the common currency throughout South-East Asia\r\n\r\nand   as  highly  valued  as  the  American  dollar,\r\n\r\nprimarily  because  it  happens  to  be  the  common\r\n\r\ncurrency   of  five  of  the  most  prosperous   and\r\n\r\npolitically stable countries in South-East Asia. Any\r\n\r\nmerchant  will  tell you that a  Straits  dollar  is\r\n\r\nvaluable  for  legitimate as  well  as  illegitimate\r\n\r\ntrading  in the whole of South-East Asia. The  break\r\n\r\nup  of  the  Straits  dollar into  five  independent\r\n\r\ncurrencies, which is inevitable if you do  not  have\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  is more likely to hit Singapore  hardest,\r\n\r\nbecause   it  is  the  heart  of  Malaysian   trade.\r\n\r\nAmbitious     political    leaders     and     great\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries might find comfort  in  the  thought\r\n\r\nthat in a balkanised and impoverished Malaysia, they\r\n\r\ncan  still  boast  that there  will  be  five  Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters,  five  Foreign  Ministers,  five  Finance\r\n\r\nMinisters and five of every kind of Ministers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Five Navy, Army and Air Forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, five Navy, Army and Air\r\n\r\nForces,    and    even   five   internal    security\r\n\r\narrangements,  but only at the cost of  turning  out\r\n\r\nfive  different currencies of doubtful value. I need\r\n\r\nnot  point to the consequences of that. The  logical\r\n\r\nconclusion  that  must follow from the  break-up  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia is that if the Straits dollar is broken up,\r\n\r\nthe  consequences  for the trader,  the  worker  and\r\n\r\nother wage-earners are too obvious to mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the States of Malaysia are balkanised in any\r\n\r\ncase, their independence would be both temporary and\r\n\r\nprecarious. They must sooner or later come under the\r\n\r\ninfluence   of   new  and  stronger   overlords.   A\r\n\r\nbalkanised Malaysia will be a derelict empire  ready\r\n\r\nfor   occupation   by  any  freebooting   power   or\r\n\r\nadventurer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia, therefore, is obvious and inevitable.\r\n\r\nThat  is  what  we  mean  when  we  keep  on  saying\r\n\r\ninevitable, a word which exasperated the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown   - because you refuse to believe  that  10\r\n\r\nmillion  people  would commit economic  suicide  and\r\n\r\nensure  their impoverishment by destroying something\r\n\r\nwhich   already  exists  and  which  ensures   their\r\n\r\nprosperity,  such as it is. Malaysia is the  obvious\r\n\r\nand  inevitable answer to the question: \"Who  is  to\r\n\r\nfill the vacuum created by the evacuation of British\r\n\r\ncolonialism?\"  The answer is: \"The five  territories\r\n\r\ncollectively.\"  That is the essence of  Malaysia.  A\r\n\r\nvacuum must be created sooner or later and therefore\r\n\r\nthat  vacuum must be filled collectively by the five\r\n\r\nterritories.  Malaysia  will  provide  the  unifying\r\n\r\ninfluence  once  exerted by the British;  only  this\r\n\r\ntime it will be a unification in the interests of an\r\n\r\nindependent Malaysia instead of British colonialism.\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  by preventing the balkanisation  of  this\r\n\r\narea,  will  ensure  the  political  integrity   and\r\n\r\nindependence of these States as well as  maintaining\r\n\r\ntheir economic prosperity and financial stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall not, at this point, deal with the real\r\n\r\nreasons why the Barisan Sosialis have become fervent\r\n\r\nadvocates\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  balkanisation. All I want to point out  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  are not the socialists that they claim to  be,\r\n\r\nthat  they are really anti-nationalists in resisting\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  As nationalists the obvious  and  logical\r\n\r\nthing   for  them  to  do  is  to  strive  for   the\r\n\r\npreservation of the territorial unity of States that\r\n\r\nonce formed part of an empire, simply because in the\r\n\r\ncontemporary  world of super States  and  contending\r\n\r\ngreat  powers,  larger political and economic  units\r\n\r\nhave  a  greater survival value. It is obviously  in\r\n\r\nthe interest of the 10 million people of Malaysia to\r\n\r\npreserve the territorial integrity and unity of  the\r\n\r\nfive States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, only a few days ago the Barisan Sosialis were\r\n\r\npleading  for the territorial integrity of Indonesia\r\n\r\nby  demanding the return of West Irian to Indonesia.\r\n\r\nWe  think it is a very laudable thing. We, like  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, regard West Irian as an  integral\r\n\r\npart  of Indonesia primarily because it was part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Dutch  Empire. We no more wish to see Indonesia\r\n\r\nbalkanised by the Dutch colonialists than we wish to\r\n\r\nsee Malaysia balkanised by the Barisan Sosialis -  the\r\n\r\nDutchmen of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, Sir, if the British colonialists have been\r\n\r\nable  to  govern Malaysia for decades as  a  unified\r\n\r\nadministration,  we, the nationalists  of  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nshould  be  as capable and as eager to provide  this\r\n\r\narea  with  a  unified administration ourselves.  In\r\n\r\nother words, Sir, what we are saying is: you do  not\r\n\r\nhave  to  create Malaysia. All we ask  is  that  the\r\n\r\nnationalists  in  the interest  of  the  10  million\r\n\r\npeople  should  preserve  an  administration   which\r\n\r\nalready exists. Let us work that administration.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  measure of the kind of Stone Age thinking  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis that they should brand attempts\r\n\r\nto  prevent  the balkanisation of Malaysia  as  neo-colonialism and reactionary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, as socialists, we should not only\r\n\r\nwelcome, but also work hard to preserve the economic\r\n\r\nunity  of  Malaysia  in order to  ensure  the  rapid\r\n\r\neconomic  advance of its peoples and to develop  the\r\n\r\npotentialities  of  the 10 million  people.  As  you\r\n\r\nknow, modern economic planning and development is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlikely to be more rapid and more effective in  large\r\n\r\nand  populous geographical areas. That is the  basis\r\n\r\ntoday  of  modem economic development.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nthink  in  terms  of larger economic  and  political\r\n\r\nunits.  Malaysia embraces an area of 130,000  square\r\n\r\nmiles. This is nearly two and a half times as  large\r\n\r\nas any individual territory in Malaysia. In terms of\r\n\r\npopulation,  we would have the markets,  the  skills\r\n\r\nand the labour power of some 10 million people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an integrated political and economic unit, the\r\n\r\neconomic  potentialities of Malaysia  are  increased\r\n\r\nmanifold.   It   can   undertake   development   and\r\n\r\nenterprises which the States cannot do individually.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  it would not be feasible  to  set  up\r\n\r\nlarge   industrial  plants  in  any   one   of   the\r\n\r\nterritories  because  these  individual  territories\r\n\r\nhave  no worthwhile markets to offer. But where  the\r\n\r\npotential  market for any industry is in the  region\r\n\r\nof 10 million people, industrialisation becomes both\r\n\r\nworthwhile and rapid. For example, where the  output\r\n\r\nof  a steel plant is about 50,000 tons a year, I  am\r\n\r\ntold that the cost per ton is estimated at $630. But\r\n\r\nwhere the output is 250,000 tons a year, the cost is\r\n\r\nreduced to $475 per ton. This is an indication  that\r\n\r\neconomic  planning  and  industrial  development  in\r\n\r\nlarger units is economic, more efficient and rapid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic planning and industrial development on a\r\n\r\nMalaysian  scale brings other advantages  which  are\r\n\r\ndenied  where planning and enterprise is on a  State\r\n\r\nscale.  As  far  as  capital is concerned,  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwould  have  the accumulated savings of  10  million\r\n\r\npeople  and,  because  of the  area  and  population\r\n\r\ninvolved, would also attract foreign capital.  Where\r\n\r\nplanning is on a Malaysian scale, scarce technicians\r\n\r\nand other professional skill can be more efficiently\r\n\r\nand fairly distributed. Conversely, the training  of\r\n\r\nscarce  technicians, administrators and professional\r\n\r\nmen can be undertaken cheaply and efficiently. It is\r\n\r\nobviously   uneconomic  for   each   of   the   five\r\n\r\nterritories  to  duplicate  universities,   training\r\n\r\ninstitutes, technical and agricultural schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this by no means exhausts the list of\r\n\r\nsubstantial advantages that the ordinary people will\r\n\r\nderive from economic development and planning  on  a\r\n\r\npan-Malaysian scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic, political and financial case for\r\n\r\nthe  preservation  of Malaysia under  conditions  of\r\n\r\nindependence is so strong -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt, but\r\n\r\nthere seems to be an earphone which is being used as\r\n\r\na loudspeaker somewhere. I do not know whether it is\r\n\r\non  the  Opposition  Benches or  in  the  Strangers'\r\n\r\nGallery. Could Members have a look and turn off  the\r\n\r\nswitches?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the economic, political and\r\n\r\nfinancial  case for the preservation of Malaysia  is\r\n\r\nso strong that many of us are wondering why the Marx\r\n\r\nBrothers  in  the  Barisan Sosialis  are  trying  to\r\n\r\nsabotage  it.  It  is significant that  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have never at any time attempted to  refute\r\n\r\nthe  economic and financial arguments in  favour  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia - that  is,  in  matters  that  concern   the\r\n\r\nlivelihood,  the material and social advancement  of\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary people. Sir, the Barisan Sosialis  are\r\n\r\nthe   people  who  talk  every  now  and  then  with\r\n\r\nreference to the people and the masses wanting  this\r\n\r\nand  that,  the  people are for us, the  people  are\r\n\r\nbehind us, and so on. They are always talking  about\r\n\r\nthe  people. Therefore, one would have thought that,\r\n\r\nwhatever  policies they might pursue, at least  they\r\n\r\nwould  have  borne in mind the interest  of  the  10\r\n\r\nmillion  masses. How are they going  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\neconomic livelihood and future of 10 million  people\r\n\r\nwho  exist today and whose prosperity is due to  the\r\n\r\nfact that this is an integrated trading and economic\r\n\r\nunit? In fact, Sir, it is necessary not only for the\r\n\r\npurpose  of these logical arguments but for  further\r\n\r\narguments  to define here what the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nmean when they talk of the people and the masses. It\r\n\r\nis   most  important - as  I  propose  to  define - what\r\n\r\nexactly they mean by masses and people. Once we know\r\n\r\nexactly what they mean, many of their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndouble-talk, somersaults and confusion  will  become\r\n\r\nclear.  It is my submission that when they  talk  of\r\n\r\n\"the  masses\"  and \"the people\", they  are  defining\r\n\r\nthem not in the ordinary meaning of the words but in\r\n\r\nthe  Communist  or Leninist sense of the  words.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  Sir, a great deal of the jargon used  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis would be less confusing if we  were\r\n\r\nto  accept  the Barisan Sosialis for what it  really\r\n\r\nis - a   Communist  front  organisation  working   for\r\n\r\nCommunist aims and objectives. It is necessary, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor  us to bear that in mind. The pretence that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  are  a  conglomeration  of   non-Communist,  socialist agrarian reformers  cannot  be \r\n\r\nmaintained any longer. If we simply call the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  \"the  Front\"  and give  their  jargon  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation that trained Communists put on it, we\r\n\r\nshall  get  a clearer understanding of the Barisan's\r\n\r\nstrange  posturings  on many issues,  including  the\r\n\r\nissue  of Malaysia. Since the Barisan Sosialis  talk\r\n\r\nso often about the masses, the people, the people of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, the people of Singapore, the people of the\r\n\r\nFederation,  the people of Sarawak,  the  masses  of\r\n\r\nBorneo,  it  will help us to understand the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  dialectical thinking if we ascertain  what\r\n\r\nthey  mean  when they talk of masses and  people - and\r\n\r\nmost  important when they talk of masses and  people\r\n\r\nin the sense that Lenin has told Communist cadres to\r\n\r\nthink of the masses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me quote from the great master himself - Selected Works, Vol. 10, pages 286 -287. It is most\r\n\r\nimportant  to  understand this quotation  when  they\r\n\r\ntalk  of the masses and the people, because it  will\r\n\r\nmake clear what exactly they mean when they talk  of\r\n\r\nthe people. This is what Lenin said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to say just a few words about the\r\n\r\nmeaning  of  the term \"masses\". The meaning  of  the\r\n\r\nterm \"masses\" changes in accordance with the changes\r\n\r\nin the character of the struggle [the struggle, Sir,\r\n\r\nis the Communist struggle] ... During our revolution\r\n\r\n[he  was  then  talking of the  Russian  Revolution]\r\n\r\nthere  were occasions when several thousand  workers\r\n\r\nrepresented the masses... When the revolution has been\r\n\r\nsufficiently prepared [that is, when you  are  ready\r\n\r\nto   take  over],  the  term  \"masses\"  acquires   a\r\n\r\ndifferent meaning. Then several thousand workers can\r\n\r\nno longer be called masses [that means the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  whom  you  called  the  masses  before   the\r\n\r\nrevolution  cease to be masses when  conditions  are\r\n\r\nripe for the revolution]. The word begins to acquire\r\n\r\na  different meaning. The term \"masses\"  then  means\r\n\r\nthe majority: [that means before that it was not the\r\n\r\nmajority  but when you are ready to take  over  then\r\n\r\nthe word \"masses\" means the majority; before that it\r\n\r\nmight  have been a minority] not merely the majority\r\n\r\nof  workers, hut the majority of all the  exploited.\r\n\r\nNo other meaning can be accepted by a revolutionary;\r\n\r\n[that  is  important - no other meaning  of  the  term\r\n\r\n\"masses\" can be accepted by a revolutionary] if  any\r\n\r\nother meaning were attached to this word it would be\r\n\r\nunintelligible. A very small party is sufficient  to\r\n\r\nlead  the masses ... But in order to achieve victory\r\n\r\nyou must have the sympathy of the masses.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore,  Sir, when the Barisan Sosialis  talk  of\r\n\r\nthe  masses  and the people, it might mean  anything\r\n\r\nfrom  13  Barisan  Sosialis Members  to  25  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis Party members. They do not mean the  people\r\n\r\nas  a whole or even, to quote Lenin, \"a majority  of\r\n\r\nthe people\". That is not what they mean by people or\r\n\r\nmasses. It does not mean the majority. It might even\r\n\r\nmean  two  Barisan Sosialis Members can  become  the\r\n\r\nmasses   at  certain  times.  So  when  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis talk of the masses, it is quite clear, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  they  mean all those who support  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis or the Communists: those are the masses. In\r\n\r\nfact,  Sir, in another of his works, Vol.  6,  pages\r\n\r\n70 - 71,  Lenin has dismissed the will of the majority\r\n\r\nas  irrelevant  when one talks of the  masses.  That\r\n\r\nagain  is important. So the masses may not mean  the\r\n\r\nmajority. It can also mean ignoring the will of  the\r\n\r\nmajority. I will quote the relevant bit:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This is the International of those\r\n\r\n\"internationalists  in  deed\"  whom  I  specifically\r\n\r\nenumerated     above.    They    alone     represent\r\n\r\nrevolutionary, international masses  ...  Let  every\r\n\r\nRussian worker ask himself how many really conscious\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries there were in Russia on the  eve  of\r\n\r\nthe  February-March Revolution of  1917.  [In  fact,\r\n\r\nSir,  it goes on to say that there were very few  of\r\n\r\nthem:]  The question is not one of numbers [that  is\r\n\r\nimportant:  the question is not one of  numbers - when\r\n\r\nyou  are talking of masses, it means something else:\r\n\r\nwhen  you  talk  of  the  majority  of  the  people,\r\n\r\naccording  to  Lenin and everybody who  accepts  the\r\n\r\nprecepts  of Lenin, it is not a question of numbers]\r\n\r\nbut  of  giving correct expression to the ideas  and\r\n\r\npolicy of the truly revolutionary proletariat.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, \"masses\" means again only the people  who\r\n\r\nsupport the Communists:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"majority\"  also  means only those who  support  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  There might be only six  but  it  still\r\n\r\nconstitutes the majority of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Lenin  says  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary   that  a  majority  of  the   people   be\r\n\r\nestablished  after the Communist  Party  has  seized\r\n\r\npower  - you seize power and then you declare who  are\r\n\r\nthe majority of the people. He says here, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The traitors, blockheads and pedants of the Second\r\n\r\nInternational [i.e. people like us, the weak  social\r\n\r\ndemocrats]     could    never    understand     this\r\n\r\ndialectics - that  the  proletariat   cannot   triumph\r\n\r\nunless it wins a majority of the population over  to\r\n\r\nits  side,  but  that to confine the  winning  of  a\r\n\r\nmajority  to, or make it conditional upon, obtaining\r\n\r\na  majority of votes at the polls under the rule  of\r\n\r\nthe bourgeoisie is either the densest stupidity,  or\r\n\r\na sheer attempt to foil the workers. In order to win\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of  the population,  the  proletariat\r\n\r\n[i.e. the Communists]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust,  in the first place, overthrow the bourgeoisie\r\n\r\nand seize the power of the state.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  ties  up, Sir, with a statement  made  by  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the Barisan Sosialis at a rally\r\n\r\nto  support  West  Irian. He  said,  \"Constitutional\r\n\r\nmethods  of  struggle  are useless.\"  So,  Sir,  you\r\n\r\nestablish  a  majority, not in terms  of  winning  a\r\n\r\nmajority of votes - all that is nonsense - but you seize\r\n\r\npower and declare that, \"We are the majority.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is important because if our thesis is that the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  has not only become  a  Communist\r\n\r\nfront  but  has also become a tool of a  Party  more\r\n\r\npowerful  than  the  Barisan  Sosialis  to  sabotage\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  then it is necessary for us to understand\r\n\r\nthe workings and thinking and strategy not of the 13\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Members - who are just frontmen,  and\r\n\r\nas  I said the Barisan, meaning the Front - but of the\r\n\r\npeople  who  really direct the Barisan Sosialis  and\r\n\r\nwho  are  interested in higher stakes than  standing\r\n\r\nfor election to this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have elaborated at length on the definitions of\r\n\r\n\"masses\",  \"people\", and \"majority\",  to  show  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the Barisan talks of the masses being  opposed\r\n\r\nto  Malaysia, they do not mean that the masses would\r\n\r\nlose  out  on merger, that the people are  going  to\r\n\r\nsuffer under merger, that the people are opposed  to\r\n\r\nthe  abolition of the Internal Security Council,  or\r\n\r\nthat the Government is not heeding the voice of  the\r\n\r\nmasses.   What  they  mean  is  that  the  Communist\r\n\r\noverlords  are  unhappy and angry that  we  are  not\r\n\r\nlistening  to  the  voice of the  masses,  i.e. the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  And when they say that the  masses  are\r\n\r\ndemanding  this or that, or that we are not  heeding\r\n\r\nthe  wishes of the masses, what they really mean  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  not conceding to the  wishes  pf  the\r\n\r\ncommunists.  When  they  talk  of  the  welfare  and\r\n\r\ninterest  of the masses of Malaysia., what they  are\r\n\r\nconcerned about is not the welfare of the 10 million\r\n\r\npeople   but   of  the  Communist  conspirators   in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, it is important for us to get that\r\n\r\npoint  across.  When they talk of  the  masses,  the\r\n\r\nmasses fight it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout  with the Communists; and the whole argument and\r\n\r\nthe whole stand become clear and logical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia, Sir, as I have shown, is necessary for\r\n\r\nthe  economic  advancement and  welfare  of  the  10\r\n\r\nmillion   people  scattered  throughout   the   five\r\n\r\nterritories. Though it is good for the  people,  the\r\n\r\neconomic  and political arguments show  that  it  is\r\n\r\ngood.  Even  the  Barisan  Sosialis  say  that,   in\r\n\r\nprinciple, it is a good thing, but in practice it is\r\n\r\nbad  for  the Communists and therefore  it  must  be\r\n\r\nresisted.  The  Balkanisation of Malaysia  may  mean\r\n\r\neconomic  dislocation  and suffering  for  the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority  of the 10 million people. But the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  are  not  thinking of the  people  or  the\r\n\r\nmasses  in  the sense that you and I mean.  That  is\r\n\r\nsmall  consideration - the sacrifice of the masses  in\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary  sense of the word - compared  with  the\r\n\r\npossible  sacrifice  of  the masses  that  Leninists\r\n\r\nhave, i.e. the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question may be asked: why is it in the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the Communists to balkanise  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand  shatter the economy on which the prosperity  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  founded? The Barisan  Sosialis  oppose\r\n\r\nmerger  for the same reason that led them to  oppose\r\n\r\nMalaysia. In both cases what the non-Communists  are\r\n\r\nseeking  is  the creation of a strong and prosperous\r\n\r\nnational  state through integration of  the  economy\r\n\r\nand administration of this area. The Communists know\r\n\r\nthat  this strong, unified and relatively prosperous\r\n\r\nstate  cannot, in the immediate future,  come  under\r\n\r\ntheir  control.  They know that  if  an  independent\r\n\r\nMalaysia  comes about today, it would pass into  the\r\n\r\nhands of a non-Communist regime, the nationalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever theories the Communists might have\r\n\r\nabout  the anti-colonial struggle, arid so on - before\r\n\r\nthe  war  the  anti-colonial struggle was  still  in\r\n\r\ntheory,  hut  after  the war the  people  have  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful    in   their   anti-colonial    struggle\r\n\r\nthroughout  Asia and Africa and the Communists  have\r\n\r\nnot  failed to note the exasperating fact  that  the\r\n\r\ncollapse of imperialism in colonial Asia and Africa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas   almost  invariably  been  succeeded   not   by\r\n\r\nCommunist  regimes but by non-Communist  nationalist\r\n\r\nregimes:  India,  Ceylon,  Burma,  Pakistan,  Egypt,\r\n\r\nSyria,  Ghana, and so on. In every case, Sir, though\r\n\r\nthe  Communists are at the forefront  of  the  anti-colonial  struggle  (and we are not  denying  that),\r\n\r\nafter  its  success  in the anti-colonial  struggle,\r\n\r\nwhat  was established was not a Communist government\r\n\r\nbut a nationalist government. That is relevant, Sir,\r\n\r\nto  Mr Aidit's piece on Malaysia. Some of the anti-colonialists, as I said, play a foremost part in the\r\n\r\nanti-colonial  struggle.  Yet  in  every  case  when\r\n\r\ncolonialism is smashed, it is not the Communists but\r\n\r\nthe nationalists who succeed in taking over power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the countries that have gained\r\n\r\nindependence, the Communists attempted revolutionary\r\n\r\nseizure   of  power.  Not  only  did  they   provoke\r\n\r\nnationalism  into  open  enmity  with  them  but  it\r\n\r\nresulted in the crushing of the Communists. In India\r\n\r\nand  in  Burma,  Communist attempts to  seize  power\r\n\r\nended  in  disaster  for them. In  Egypt,  President\r\n\r\nNasser,  though he is on the best of terms with  the\r\n\r\nRussians  and  the Communists, deals pretty  roughly\r\n\r\nwith  his  own Communists. Again, Sir, in 1948  when\r\n\r\nthe  Indonesian  Communists staged  a  revolutionary\r\n\r\nuprising  in  Madium,  they  took  more  than   they\r\n\r\nbargained for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the allegations made by the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis that supporters of merger and Malaysia  are\r\n\r\npro-colonial stooges, it may be well to remind  them\r\n\r\nwhat the P.K.I. leaders called President Soekarno in\r\n\r\n1948 when the Communists decided to seize power, and\r\n\r\nin  fact attempted to seize power in Madium. This is\r\n\r\nhow Musso -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

And  now  we  get  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Finance  walking   right   through,\r\n\r\ncompletely preoccupied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Oh.

For example, in Madium  when  the\r\n\r\nCommunists staged an uprising, Musso, one of the top\r\n\r\nCommunist leaders, described President Soekarno  as:\r\n\r\n\"Soekarno-Hatta,  the slaves of Japan  and  America!\r\n\r\nTraitors   must  die!\"  And  a  Communist  broadcast\r\n\r\ndescribed the Madium uprising as a popular  uprising\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Government  of  the  Fascist  Japanese\r\n\r\nQuisling,  Soekarno and Hatta. These  are  the  same\r\n\r\npeople,  Sir, who put up posters today for Soekarno.\r\n\r\nTheir  own  leaders, when it suited their  interest,\r\n\r\ncalled  Soekarno  and  Hatta  slaves  of  Japan  and\r\n\r\nAmerica   - Fascist Japanese Quislings,  Soekarno  and\r\n\r\nHatta.  So  whether  a  nationalist  leader   is   a\r\n\r\n\"progressive\"  or  a  \"colonial stooge\"  depends  on\r\n\r\nwhether  the leader happens to be pursuing a  policy\r\n\r\nwhich   is   favourable  or  unfavourable   to   the\r\n\r\nCommunists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to round off the story. May I say, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthe Madium uprising failed and Musso and a few other\r\n\r\ngentlemen  were  executed by the  nationalists.  But\r\n\r\nthat is in passing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every time the Communists try their strength\r\n\r\nwith  the nationalists they meet with disaster. That\r\n\r\nis  a  historical law. To use another  phrase  which\r\n\r\nthey  can  understand - the law of social development.\r\n\r\nEven in Syria, Sir, some of those in the United Arab\r\n\r\nRepublic  who tried to break up the two  territories\r\n\r\nended  by having in Syria a government which is  far\r\n\r\nmore Right-wing than they expected. Similarly, Sir,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Hitler's Germany, the Communists again tried  to\r\n\r\ndouble-cross the socialists and they ended  up  with\r\n\r\nHitler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder how the Minister can\r\n\r\nrelate all those remarks to the motion. Shall we try\r\n\r\nand come to the motion as quickly as possible?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is quite pertinent, Sir. My\r\n\r\nthesis  is  that they are anti-nationalists  and  if\r\n\r\nthey are fighting the nationalists they are going to\r\n\r\nconic  a cropper, as many Communists did in Germany,\r\n\r\nItaly, Spain and even the United Arab Republic. That\r\n\r\nis  just  an indication that whoever play  with  the\r\n\r\nforces  of  history, and if the  forces  of  history\r\n\r\nhappen  to  be going one way and they happen  to  be\r\n\r\ngoing  the  other way, then they are going  to  face\r\n\r\ndisaster.  And  this fact - that is, every  time  they\r\n\r\ntake  on  the  nationalists, they lose  out  to  the\r\n\r\nnationalists - the Communists find extremely baffling.\r\n\r\nSo  rather than admit that the people, the masses of\r\n\r\nthese  territories,  after  independence,  are   not\r\n\r\nenamoured of what is called the dictatorship of  the\r\n\r\nproletariat,  therefore,  the  Communists   try   to\r\n\r\nexplain  the  whole thing away by  saying  that  any\r\n\r\nnationalist regime that does not play the  Communist\r\n\r\ngame  cannot be really independent. That is  another\r\n\r\ntalk,  Sir.  When  the Barisan Sosialis  talk  about\r\n\r\nphoney  independence  or  that  the  Tunku  is   not\r\n\r\nindependent,  what they mean is this.  Their  theory\r\n\r\nsays that once the anti-colonial revolution is over,\r\n\r\nthe masses, the people, should automatically support\r\n\r\nCommunism.  But  in fact just the opposite  happens.\r\n\r\nThe  nationalists will take over and the  Communists\r\n\r\nare pushed around. So they have to explain how is it\r\n\r\nthat  during elections it is not the Communists  who\r\n\r\nwin,  but it is the nationalists who win. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  say, well, if that happens, that must  be  not\r\n\r\nbecause  of  anything else but that the  country  is\r\n\r\nreally not independent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, yesterday's Straits Times\r\n\r\npublished an interview Mr Alex Josey - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I am sorry, Sir, the adviser of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  and  it is better advice  that  Mr  Alex\r\n\r\nJosey  gives  me than Mr Aidit is giving  them,  as\r\n\r\nthey  will soon discover, Sir, we in Singapore  have\r\n\r\nnever  commented on the activities  of  the  P.K.I.,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the  Indonesian Communist Party,  because\r\n\r\nwhat  the P.K.I. says or does is solely the business\r\n\r\nof  the Indonesian people. But when the P.K.I. takes\r\n\r\nit  upon  itself to join in the campaign to sabotage\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia, then the people  of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nhave  the  right  to  counter  P.K.I. mischief   in\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I  shall  deal later  with  the  P.K.I.'s\r\n\r\nattempts  to incite their local stooges to break  up\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Just  now I would like to  show  why  Mr\r\n\r\nAidit  in his article and other Communists  keep  on\r\n\r\ndescribing as not fully independent countries  which\r\n\r\neveryone else accepts as independent, including  the\r\n\r\nFederation. We put forward a merger. They say it  is\r\n\r\na  phoney  merger  because it  does  not  give  full\r\n\r\nindependence.  Malaysia - well,  that  is   a   phoney\r\n\r\nMalaysia because it does not give full independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for us, therefore, again to\r\n\r\nunderstand  exactly what they mean by  independence.\r\n\r\nAs  I  said,  Mr  Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  they  give\r\n\r\nmeanings  to  words like \"majority\",  \"people\",  and\r\n\r\n\"masses\" which are quite different from the ordinary\r\n\r\ndictionary  meanings,  that  is  the  meanings  that\r\n\r\nordinary  people  give  to these  words.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nagain, we must understand what exactly they mean  by\r\n\r\nindependence.  The  countries which  everybody  else\r\n\r\naccepts  as  independent  they  say  are  not  fully\r\n\r\nindependent. It is their way of getting out  of  the\r\n\r\ntheoretical  dilemma why the anti-colonial  struggle\r\n\r\ninvariably  ends  in a victory for the  nationalists\r\n\r\nrather than for the Communists.

This   is\r\n\r\nessential  because on this definition he builds  his\r\n\r\ncase against Malaysia:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Neo-colonialism is a new form of colonialism...'.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>That,  Sir,  as logic is not profound.  It  is  like\r\n\r\nsaying, `Dog is equal to dog.' `Neo-colonialism is a\r\n\r\nnew  form  of colonialism.' But that certainly  must\r\n\r\nhave  impressed  and puzzled the  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis because it comes from Aidit -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, on a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Is the Minister suggesting that there is\r\n\r\nno such thing as neo-colonialism?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am not suggesting that there is\r\n\r\nno such thing as neo-colonialism, but I was going to\r\n\r\nindicate  that the term \"neo-colonialism\"  is  being\r\n\r\nused  to  bamboozle  people into believing  that  an\r\n\r\nindependent country is not independent, as  I  shall\r\n\r\nuse  quotations to show this not only from Aidit but\r\n\r\nfrom  the adviser of the Barisan Sosialis and a  few\r\n\r\nother gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

For\r\n\r\nexample, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`More and more coloured peoples are joining the\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations, for example, but many of them  have\r\n\r\naccepted less than full and complete independence.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So   obviously,  Sir,  there  are  many   Afro-Asian\r\n\r\ncountries in the United Nations, not just a few  but\r\n\r\nmany,   all  of  whom,  according  to  Mr   Aidit's\r\n\r\ndefinition   of  neo-colonialism,  are  not   really\r\n\r\nindependent. They have accepted less than  full  and\r\n\r\ncomplete independence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we all know that no country can be\r\n\r\nadmitted  to the United Nations unless its  members,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  Communist  countries  as  well,  are\r\n\r\nsatisfied that it is a fully independent country. No\r\n\r\ncountry  which  is  not fully independent  can  gain\r\n\r\nadmission to the United Nations. There is a vigorous\r\n\r\ntest, and among the testers are the Russians and the\r\n\r\nCommunist  countries.  So  the  Communist  test   of\r\n\r\nindependence obviously is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  the kind of test that is applied in the  United\r\n\r\nNations. That is the point I am trying to arrive at.\r\n\r\nThat  when  Nkruma  talks  of  neo-colonialism   and\r\n\r\ncolonialism  he  means  that certain  countries  are\r\n\r\ndirectly subject to colonial rule. But when Aidit or\r\n\r\nthe Communist talk of neo-colonialism, they mean  it\r\n\r\nin  a  completely different sense.  They  define  it\r\n\r\ndifferently from the way it is defined in the United\r\n\r\nNations  by  the  non-Communist  countries  and  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  countries.  Therefore,  I  am  trying  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  the Communists have again  their  own\r\n\r\ndefinition of independence; just as they have  their\r\n\r\npeculiar  definition of what is  \"people\",  what  is\r\n\r\n\"the majority\" and what are \"the masses\" -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And what is merger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I notice that the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  constantly  need  the  assistance  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson. I do not know whether he is a back-seat driver, but he is the remotest from all the  13\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  from across this side of  the  Chamber.\r\n\r\nSir, if we define neo-colonialism as the refusal  of\r\n\r\nindependent countries to accept the Communist regime\r\n\r\nin  preference  to a nationalist regime,  then,  Mr\r\n\r\nAidit's  meaning as well as analysis becomes  clear.\r\n\r\nWhen   he   says  that  a  country  has  not   \"full\r\n\r\nindependence\",  what he means is  that  it  has  not\r\n\r\nbecome Communist. The implication is that the masses\r\n\r\nreally   want  Communism.  That  is,  the   colonial\r\n\r\ncountries which have become independent  - the  masses\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- really want Communism but cannot realise their\r\n\r\nhopes  because of the mysterious power  called  neo-colonialism  which frustrates their  desire.  So  in\r\n\r\nthat   way  he  pleases  the  Communists.  He   says\r\n\r\nhistorically if there is real independence, then the\r\n\r\nwhole  world would go Communist. But at the  moment,\r\n\r\neven   an   independent  country  is   really   neo-colonialist, and therefore the masses are still with\r\n\r\nthe Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Indonesia is not Communist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is what Mr Aidit said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I am just coming to that point. The\r\n\r\nneo-colonialists  are  therefore  people   who   are\r\n\r\nnationalists  but not Communists.  Mr  Aidit  makes\r\n\r\nthis  clear when he says that Indonesia is not fully\r\n\r\nindependent  either.  It  is  quite  clear  in  this\r\n\r\narticle.  This can only mean that President Soekarno\r\n\r\nis  himself - according to Aidit's definition - the head\r\n\r\nof  a  neo-colonial country, a country which is  not\r\n\r\nfully independent. Sir, I will quote Aidit, who is a\r\n\r\nbetter  authority.  This is  what  he  says  in  the\r\n\r\ninterview:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Basically the economy is not in the hands of the\r\n\r\nnative  people  but foreigners. We  still  have  the\r\n\r\nproblem of neo-colonialism in Indonesia.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>All  this talk, Sir, of independent countries.  Here\r\n\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We still have the problem of neo-colonialism in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>As  I have pointed out earlier, Sir, the P.K.I. once\r\n\r\ncalled Soekarno a Quisling and a traitor. Now to get\r\n\r\nacross  their point, they even imply that  President\r\n\r\nSoekarno   is   the  President  of  a   neo-colonial\r\n\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Much of our industry, for example, belongs to the\r\n\r\nforeigners. Culturally our determination to  develop\r\n\r\nalong  our  own  lines  is  very  strong,  but   the\r\n\r\nimperialists  still penetrate with  worthless  films\r\n\r\nand words and so forth.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, intelligent people will find it hard to\r\n\r\nswallow  that Indonesia is not fully independent  or\r\n\r\nthat  it is, after all, a neo-colonial country.  But\r\n\r\nif we bear in mind that when a Communist says that a\r\n\r\ncountry is not independent, what he means is that it\r\n\r\nis  not  Communist, or that it frustrates  Communist\r\n\r\ndesigns   to  turn  the  country  into  a  Communist\r\n\r\noutpost, then we are not likely to be confused. Sir,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  say  there is no political independence,\r\n\r\nthis is not independence, or that we are not working\r\n\r\ntowards  independence, what they really mean  is  to\r\n\r\ncross  out the word \"independence\" and put the  word\r\n\r\n\"Communist\"; the whole thing becomes clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly. Sir, when the pocket Aidits of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis claim that the Federation  is  not\r\n\r\nindependent  and imply that the Tunku is  a  Western\r\n\r\ncolonial stooge, what their double-talk really means\r\n\r\nis that the Federation is not independent because it\r\n\r\nis not giving Communists \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand pro-Communists a free hand to pave  the\r\n\r\nway for a Communist takeover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the test of the United Nations, the Federation\r\n\r\nis independent.

Byrne):</b>\r\n\r\nNeo-Chin Peng!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, therefore, today you find\r\n\r\nafter  all  these  authorities,  starting  from  the\r\n\r\nadviser to the Barisan Sosialis (I presume, Sir,  he\r\n\r\nis still the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadviser  to the Barisan Sosialis) to Mr  Fong  Swee\r\n\r\nSuan  and  so  on, and culminating  in  Chin  Peng's\r\n\r\nstatement -  his judgment on whether the Tunku  was  a\r\n\r\nstooge  and  whether the Federation was independent.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is difficult to find that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and the Communist godfathers in  Indonesia\r\n\r\ncontend that the Tunku is a cat's-paw of the British\r\n\r\nand  that,  to  quote  Mr Aidit,  the  Federation's\r\n\r\nindependence is an illusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the Barisan Sosialis imply that the Tunku\r\n\r\nis  a British stooge and that the Federation is  not\r\n\r\nfully  independent, they are defining \"independence\"\r\n\r\nin  the  way  a Communist defines it  -  a  colonial\r\n\r\ncountry  is  not independent if it is not Communist.\r\n\r\nIf you bear that definition in mind, every lime they\r\n\r\ntalk of \"independent\" or \"not fully independent\", we\r\n\r\nknow  what  they  really mean.  When  they  talk  of\r\n\r\nindependence  they mean a colonial  country  is  not\r\n\r\nindependent  if  it is not Communist.  So  when  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  talk  about  fighting  for   full\r\n\r\nindependence and carrying on the colonial  struggle,\r\n\r\nwhat  they  really mean is that the  fight  must  be\r\n\r\ncarried  on until a Communist Singapore, a Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya and a Communist Malaysia is achieved. That is\r\n\r\nwhat  they  mean by an anti-colonial struggle.  They\r\n\r\nkeep on talking about the anti-colonial struggle  is\r\n\r\nnot  finished  in  the Federation. To  the  ordinary\r\n\r\npeople, it does not make sense. But if you cross out\r\n\r\n\"anti-colonial\"  and put \"Communist  struggle\",  the\r\n\r\nfight  for  independence  means  to  strive  for   a\r\n\r\nCommunist  Federation, then the whole thing  becomes\r\n\r\nquite clear. So if you constantly bear in mind  that\r\n\r\nif the Barisan Sosialis talk of carrying on the anti-colonial struggle, what they really mean is carrying\r\n\r\non  the  struggle for Communism; and that when  they\r\n\r\ntalk of an independent Malaya or Malaysia, what they\r\n\r\nreally mean is a Communist Malaya or Malaysia,  then\r\n\r\nall  their confusing antics, somersaults and double-talk become clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there is their inexplicable attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  merger. The nationalists say that the  best\r\n\r\nway to liquidate British colonialism and gain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindependence  for Singapore is by merging  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  But  the  Barisan  say  it  is  a  pro-colonialist and reactionary merger. The  true  anti-colonialist solution, the Barisan Sosialis claim, is\r\n\r\nto  fight  for  full internal self-government  while\r\n\r\nleaving  defence  and  foreign  affairs  in  British\r\n\r\nhands. Now, that is extremely puzzling. Here on  one\r\n\r\nside  we say, \"Merge to get independence.\" They say,\r\n\r\n\"No,    that   is   pro-colonial.   That   is    not\r\n\r\nindependence.\"  But  fight for full  internal  self-government, hand over foreign affairs and defence to\r\n\r\nthe  British,  and that becomes a real anti-colonial\r\n\r\nstruggle. That would not make any sense unless, as J\r\n\r\nhave  said earlier, we define the word \"independent\"\r\n\r\nin  the  sense that the Communists mean. To struggle\r\n\r\nfor  independence means to struggle for a  Communist\r\n\r\nMalaya.   So,  therefore,  internal  self-government\r\n\r\nwithout  the  Internal Security Council  becomes  an\r\n\r\nanti-colonial struggle because it advances the cause\r\n\r\nof  Communism. In other words, Sir, to fight  for  a\r\n\r\nsemi-colonial  Singapore  is  more  progressive  and\r\n\r\ntestifies to a more fervent anti-colonialism than to\r\n\r\nfight  for  a merger where foreign affairs,  defence\r\n\r\nand  internal  security would be  in  the  hands  of\r\n\r\nMalayans, and not the British.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how are we to reconcile this absurd\r\n\r\ncontradiction?  By  simply  asking  ourselves  which\r\n\r\ncourse  would be more advantageous to the  Communist\r\n\r\ncause  - independence through merger or internal self-government; a Malaya or Malaysia controlled  by  the\r\n\r\nnationalists  or a Malaya or Malaysia controlled  by\r\n\r\nthe British?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is that after their bitter experience\r\n\r\nwith  colonial nationalisms in Asia and Africa,  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  have  today come to the conclusion  that\r\n\r\ntheir chances of survival and victory are better  in\r\n\r\na  colonial  or semi-colonial territory than  in  an\r\n\r\nindependent territory. That is the real  truth  when\r\n\r\nthey  have analysed the position. They have decided,\r\n\r\nin  view  of  their experiences with nationalism  in\r\n\r\nAsia  and  Africa, where they always come a cropper,\r\n\r\nthat in the present context the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanti-colonial struggle - in the Communist sense,  that\r\n\r\nis, to further the cause of Communism  - is better  in\r\n\r\na  colonial or semi-colonial Malaya or Malaysia than\r\n\r\nin  an independent Malaya or Malaysia, because  they\r\n\r\nknow  that colonialism is a weak force as  it  is  a\r\n\r\ndying  force. Nationalism, on the other hand,  is  a\r\n\r\nvirile,  dynamic and irresistible force  which  time\r\n\r\nafter   time  has  given  Communism  a  had  mauling\r\n\r\nwherever  it  tries  to  tame  nationalism  to   its\r\n\r\npurpose.  So  while  shouting fierce  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nslogans,  the  Communists of Malaysia manoeuvre  and\r\n\r\nconspire  even with the British to halt  the  growth\r\n\r\nand  unity  of nationalism. Therefore,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, on behalf of their Communist mentors,  are\r\n\r\nresisting  merger, not because it  is  bad  for  the\r\n\r\npeople but because it means a consolidation of  non-Communist  nationalist forces in Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  They  must break up merger  because  it\r\n\r\nmeans  the  unification of non-Communist nationalist\r\n\r\nforces.  That is why the Barisan Sosialis  in  their\r\n\r\ndesperation even went to the extent of going to  the\r\n\r\nU.K.  Commissioner  with secret  proposals  that  in\r\n\r\nreturn   for   full  internal  self-government   and\r\n\r\nabolition of the Internal Security Council they were\r\n\r\nready  to let the British have their bases  and  run\r\n\r\nthe   foreign  policy  of  Singapore.  That  is   an\r\n\r\nadmission that today the Communists in Singapore and\r\n\r\nMalaya have analysed themselves to a position  where\r\n\r\nthey  say, \"Boy, we have better chances of  survival\r\n\r\nunder the British than under the nationalists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is simple. Under the proposed\r\n\r\narrangement  with the British, the I.S.C. would  be\r\n\r\nabolished and so the Communists hope they could have\r\n\r\na  free run in a semi-colonial Singapore. The forces\r\n\r\nof   Malayan   nationalism  could  be  isolated   by\r\n\r\nperpetuating  the  division of the two  territories.\r\n\r\nWhen the Communists have consolidated their position\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and strengthened their position in the\r\n\r\nFederation and the Borneo territories at the expense\r\n\r\nof  non-Communist nationalist forces, only then  can\r\n\r\nthey launch an anti-colonial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmovement against the British. Under such conditions,\r\n\r\na victory against colonialism could result in a take-over  by the Communists and not by the nationalists.\r\n\r\nThat  is  what they want. Today they are  not  ready\r\n\r\norganisationally or psychologically to take over  if\r\n\r\nindependence  should  be granted  to  this  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore, just like the reactionaries of old,  they\r\n\r\nwant  to  postpone independence because  they  would\r\n\r\nrather  the British continue and give them  time  to\r\n\r\nbuild up their forces sp that in a competition  with\r\n\r\nthe  nationalists they hope that they can take  over\r\n\r\nthe  country.  But at the moment they know  that  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  independence in any of these territories,\r\n\r\nthey  must  in  the  competition  lose  out  to  the\r\n\r\nnationalists  as they have done in  every  place  in\r\n\r\nAsia and Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists know that merger and Malaysia will\r\n\r\nresult  in  the  transfer of  sovereignty  from  the\r\n\r\nBritish  to  the Malayan nationalists  and  not  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  The Communists are not  in  a  position\r\n\r\ntoday  to  take  over  control  of  the  nationalist\r\n\r\nmovement. Therefore, they cannot, for all their anti-colonial posturings, really afford to fight for  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  liquidation of British rule in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the Borneo territories. They know that the real\r\n\r\nand  most  effective barrier to Communism  today  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  not the British but the  non-Communist\r\n\r\nnationalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if the Barisan Sosialis and their pro-Communist\r\n\r\nfriends  were to succeed in breaking up  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia, they know what the immediate consequences\r\n\r\nare.  They know that Singapore will remain a  colony\r\n\r\nunder  the  British. If you stop  merger,  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill still remain a colony. If you bust up Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe Borneo territories will remain British colonies.\r\n\r\nIt  is  my  thesis.  Sir,  that  today  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and the Communists have put themselves in a\r\n\r\nhumiliating position  - as I said during the debate on\r\n\r\nmerger   - of  having to prop up the British  colonial\r\n\r\nregime  to ensure their survival. They cannot,  dare\r\n\r\nnot  and will not fight the local nationalists. That\r\n\r\nis  precisely  what the Barisan Sosialis  and  their\r\n\r\nCommunist puppet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmasters really want - the maintenance of British  rule\r\n\r\nin  these territories until the Communists are ready\r\n\r\nto take over and not the nationalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I indicated at the beginning of my speech,\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary people in all the territories  have  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  to  gain economically, politically  and\r\n\r\nculturally   under   Malaysia.  The   economic   and\r\n\r\npolitical  arguments for Malaysia  are  irrefutable.\r\n\r\nBut however good Malaysia may be for the people - that\r\n\r\nis,  the  ordinary men in the sense  that  the  non-Communist use it - it is bad for the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nand their Communist mentors and therefore it must be\r\n\r\nresisted  at  all  costs. When the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ntalk  of  Malaysia being bad for the  \"people\" - as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  they  define it in the Leninist  sense -   they\r\n\r\nmean  Communists and Communist stooges.  As  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The question is not one of numbers but of giving\r\n\r\ncorrect  expression to the ideas and policy  of  the\r\n\r\ntrue revolutionary proletariat.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  how  do the Barisan Sosialis today propose  to\r\n\r\nhalt merger and Malaysia?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, they, the great anti-colonialists,\r\n\r\ntried   to  stop  merger  by  trying  to  sell   the\r\n\r\nindependence of Singapore to the British  in  return\r\n\r\nfor  internal  self-government  minus  the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council.  They tried  to  convince  the\r\n\r\nBritish that they were non-Communist socialists  who\r\n\r\ncould  be  trusted to ensure the safety of  British\r\n\r\nbases  in  Singapore. That is  the  line  they  were\r\n\r\ntrying to put over to the British. Sir, what we must\r\n\r\nunderstand  is  that this duplicity is  an  integral\r\n\r\npart of Communist strategy. Here again is an example\r\n\r\nof Lenin's advice to Communist cadres. He said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is necessary [for a good Communist] to agree to\r\n\r\nany  and  every sacrifice and even, if need  be,  to\r\n\r\nresort  to all sorts of strategems, manoeuvres,  and\r\n\r\nillegal  methods,  to evasions  and  subterfuges  in\r\n\r\norder  to  penetrate the trade unions, to remain  in\r\n\r\nthem, and to carry on Communist work in them at  all\r\n\r\ncosts.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  relates to trade unions. But to penetrate  any\r\n\r\norganisation,  the  Communist must  have  no  qualms\r\n\r\nabout resorting to evasions, subterfuges and deceit.\r\n\r\nThat  is  part of the Communist training.  To  those\r\n\r\nCommunists who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmight  have  qualms  about  resorting  to  evasions,\r\n\r\nsubterfuges, and illegal methods. Lenin himself  had\r\n\r\nthis advice to offer:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We say that our morality is entirely subordinated\r\n\r\nto  the  interests  of the c1ass  struggle  ...  Our\r\n\r\nmorality is deduced from the class struggle.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>So,  Sir,  the  term  \"class  struggle\"  is  another\r\n\r\nmisleading   Communist  term   for   the   Communist\r\n\r\nstruggle.  So  what  Lenin's advice  means  is  that\r\n\r\nsubterfuges,  evasions, betrayals,  plots  with  the\r\n\r\nBritish  are  justifiable so long  as  they  promote\r\n\r\nCommunism.   For  a  Communist  the  definition   of\r\n\r\nmorality  is  anything which promotes the  Communist\r\n\r\nstruggle    Subterfuges,    evasions,    manoeuvres,\r\n\r\neverything is justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this secret plotting to sell out the\r\n\r\nindependence of Singapore to the British,  from  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  point of view, from the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\npoint of view, is justified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That little secret deal with the British not only\r\n\r\nfailed  but  the exposure of this deal revealed  the\r\n\r\nanti-nationalist intrigues of the Barisan  Sosialis.\r\n\r\nSo having been exposed there, they then attempted to\r\n\r\nconfuse the people and sabotage merger by asking for\r\n\r\n-full  merger. This subterfuge, too,  has  now  been\r\n\r\nexposed. They have lost the battle for merger.  They\r\n\r\nare losing the battle for Malaysia, and Malaysia  is\r\n\r\nan even greater threat to Communism than merger. The\r\n\r\nMalayan Communists are not in a position to halt  it\r\n\r\nand   so  the  Barisan  Sosialis  have  turned   for\r\n\r\nassistance  to a new ally - the P.K.I. (the Indonesian\r\n\r\nCommunist Party).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first public indication of a sell-out of\r\n\r\nMalaysia by local Communists to the P.K.I. came in a\r\n\r\nreport of an interview that Mr Lim Ching Siong, the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis,   was\r\n\r\nsupposed   to   have  given  to  the   pro-Communist\r\n\r\nIndonesian paper.

It seemed odd. Sir,  that  an\r\n\r\nimportant  change  of policy -  such  as  advocating\r\n\r\nmerger  of Singapore with Indonesia when,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nevery  socialist and the Barisan Sosialis  in  their\r\n\r\nmanifesto have declared that they believe in  merger\r\n\r\nof  Singapore with the Federation - should  have  been\r\n\r\nannounced  in  an  interview  with  a  pro-Communist\r\n\r\npaper, not in Singapore but in Indonesia. To be fair\r\n\r\nto  Mr  Lim,  Sir, may I say that  he  subsequently\r\n\r\ndenied having given such an interview. I am prepared\r\n\r\nto  take  his  denial in good faith;  that  what  he\r\n\r\ndenied  was  that he had not given an  interview  to\r\n\r\nthis  particular paper. However, he has  not  denied\r\n\r\nthe  thesis  that  was attributed  to  him  in  this\r\n\r\nnewspaper.  So it is still a Secret. No announcement\r\n\r\nhad been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmade   that   the  Barisan  Sosialis  now   favoured\r\n\r\nSingapore  merging with Indonesia which, if  it  was\r\n\r\nreally true, certainly accounts for their resistance\r\n\r\nto merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, I think it was last Monday or Tuesday, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson  went  even  further  when   he\r\n\r\ndescribed  the Malaysia plan as anti-Indonesian.  In\r\n\r\nhis  view,  to  quote the Member's  own  words,  Sir\r\n\r\n-\"Malaysia should have Indonesia as its heart-land.\"\r\n\r\nSir,  not  even  as  a member, and  not  even  as  a\r\n\r\npartner, but as the heart-land of Malaysia. The term\r\n\r\n\"heart-land\"  has a specific geo-political  meaning.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  I think it was the prophecy of  Mackinder\r\n\r\nwho  proposed  the idea of heart-land of  Euro-Asia,\r\n\r\nwhich was Russia. So \"heart-land\" has a specific geo-political meaning. In the geo-political sense of the\r\n\r\nterm,   it  is  the  strategic  centre  from   which\r\n\r\npolitical, economic and social power radiates to the\r\n\r\nperiphery  of the heart-land. That in itself  is  an\r\n\r\ninteresting theory, Sir. That means that what we are\r\n\r\nnow   told  is  not  Malaysia,  but  Malaysia   with\r\n\r\nIndonesia as the heart-land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of us may have thought that the Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson was merely expressing a foolish personal\r\n\r\nview  or even a madder view of the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir, the report of the interview by  Aidit,\r\n\r\nthe  P.K.I. leader, which appeared in  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes of yesterday, now makes it all too clear  that\r\n\r\nMr  Tim Ching Siong and the Member for Thomson  are\r\n\r\nnot  echoing personal views or accidental views, but\r\n\r\nthey  are  echoing decisions that had  already  been\r\n\r\narrived at by top Indonesian Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the battle for Malaysia takes on a different\r\n\r\nmeaning  with  each passing week. When Malaysia  was\r\n\r\nfirst  proposed,  Sir, if you  will  recollect,  the\r\n\r\nreaction  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis  was   neutral\r\n\r\nsupport  and no agitation, i.e. no public  agitation\r\n\r\nfrom  one  section of the Barisan Sosialis.  By  and\r\n\r\nlarge,  the  tendency  was  to  accept  Malaysia  in\r\n\r\nprinciple,  presumably  because  at  that  time  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis were engaged in a  more  immediate\r\n\r\nbattle against\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger.  And  they believed that the  Malaysia  plan\r\n\r\nwhich  had  been  propounded by the Tunku  was  just\r\n\r\nsomething  airy-fairy and would die out.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey paid no great attention to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is clear now that the Barisan Sosialis are\r\n\r\nno longer a non-Communist, socialist, Malayan Party.\r\n\r\nThey  are  but  helpless  creatures,  the  miserable\r\n\r\nstooges  of the P.K.I. What is happening, Sir,  with\r\n\r\nthe  political strip-tease that the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nare  indulging in, is that under pressure of  events\r\n\r\nthey  are  being forced to shed their veils  one  by\r\n\r\none -   the  democratic veil, the non-Communist  veil,\r\n\r\nthe socialist veil, and now the Malayan veil. And we\r\n\r\nsee  before us, Sir, not the Barisan Sosialis  which\r\n\r\nsay   that  they  believe  in  a  democratic,   non-Communist, socialist Malaya, but a Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nwhich have become the branch or the messenger boy of\r\n\r\nthe  P.K.I.  Therefore,  in fighting  Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  leaders,  whether  Communists  or\r\n\r\nadventurists, have been driven willy-nilly to embark\r\n\r\nupon  the greatest betrayal of all  - the sell-out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the Federation of Malaya, and  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nto the P.K.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Sir, they are merely following instructions\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Leninist text -  a good Communist  must  be\r\n\r\nready  to betray his own, country. That again,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  an essential part of the Leninist teaching.  For\r\n\r\nexample, Lenin says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Class struggle is impossible without dealing blows\r\n\r\nto  one's own bourgeoisie, one's own government, and\r\n\r\ndealing  a  blow to one's own government in  wartime\r\n\r\nmeans ... [and this is important] ... high treason.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>A  Communist  must  be  prepared  to  practise  high\r\n\r\ntreason. I am quoting from Lenin:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.... it means facilitating the defeat of one's own\r\n\r\ncountry.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That   again  is  a  good  Leninist  text.  A   good\r\n\r\ndisciplined  Communist must accept that proposition,\r\n\r\ni.e. a good Communist must be prepared to betray his\r\n\r\nown  country. That is what he called \"high treason\",\r\n\r\nwhich  means \"facilitating the defeat of  one's  own\r\n\r\ncountry\".  Is  it  any wonder, Sir, that  everywhere\r\n\r\nCommunists should come into conflict\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  nationalists, because once a  Communist  front\r\n\r\norganisation    comes    under    the    disciplined\r\n\r\ninstructions of a Communist Party, then  to  further\r\n\r\nCommunism  they  must be prepared to  practise  high\r\n\r\ntreason  and  facilitate the  defeat  of  their  own\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, in working as stool pigeons of the\r\n\r\nP.K.I.,  the Barisan Sosialis are out to  facilitate\r\n\r\nthe eventual domination of Malaysian territories  by\r\n\r\nthe  P.K.I.  That is why the P.K.I. has  now  openly\r\n\r\ncome  to  the aid of the Barisan Sosialis and  their\r\n\r\nunhappy  adventurers who must now  embark  upon  the\r\n\r\nmost   humiliating   and  most  dangerous   of   all\r\n\r\nadventures    - the   sell-out   of   Singapore,   the\r\n\r\nFederation,   and   Malaysia   to   the   Indonesian\r\n\r\nCommunists   - the betrayal of their  own  country,  a\r\n\r\npractice of high treason. Let us, therefore, not  be\r\n\r\ndeluded  any  longer by the facade that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is  a  non-Communist,  socialist,  Malayan\r\n\r\nParty. It is a Communist front ready to sell out the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore to the Indonesian  Communists,\r\n\r\ni.e. if  the  Indonesian Communists  ever  come  to\r\n\r\npower.  Therefore, Sir, let us no  longer  carry  on\r\n\r\nthis  pretence  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis  is   a\r\n\r\nsocialist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest I be accused of being unfair when I say that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis is not a  socialist,  Malayan\r\n\r\nParty,  let me quote a document from Tue Battle  for\r\n\r\nMerger. This is a document written by Mr Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong,   the   Secretary-General  of   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  a Party which says that it stands  for  a\r\n\r\nnon-Communist,  socialist, democratic  Malaya.  This\r\n\r\ndocument  was  written to commemorate the  death  of\r\n\r\nStalin  who,  as  we  know,  had  been  removed   by\r\n\r\nKhruschev.  I  am  not quite sure whether  Khruschev\r\n\r\nconies under the definition of a social democrat  or\r\n\r\na  running dog of the Imperialists. But this is what Mr Lim Ching Siong said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We must forever remember: We have already sworn\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Red  flag  and  old  Stalin.  We   must\r\n\r\nresolutely  uphold the interests of the Organisation\r\n\r\nat all times and under all circumstances.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  organisation, Sir, refers to  the  Anti-British\r\n\r\nLeague,   which  is  another  Communist   controlled\r\n\r\norganisation.  So  here is the Secretary-General  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis who says, \"We are sworn before\r\n\r\nthe  Red  flag and old Stalin.\" Later on he  enjoins\r\n\r\nupon  his followers to read some interesting  books,\r\n\r\nagain  from two non-socialist democratic members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis. The books he recommends  are\r\n\r\nvery  interesting:  \"Malenkov's  Political  Report\",\r\n\r\n\"Stalin's   Talks\",  \"Liu  Shao-Chi's  Training   in\r\n\r\nDiscipline  of the Organisation\", and editorials  of\r\n\r\nthe  \"Freedom  News\". To acquire basic knowledge  of\r\n\r\nMarxism and Leninism, he recommends \"The History  of\r\n\r\nthe   Russian  Communist  Party\",  \"The   Basis   of\r\n\r\nLeninism\" and so on. In fact, I would enjoin members\r\n\r\nof  other  political Parties to read some  of  these\r\n\r\nbooks  except \"Freedom News\", because I think it  is\r\n\r\nproscribed,  unless you happen to be  a  subscriber.\r\n\r\nBut  I would suggest that those who cannot get these\r\n\r\nbooks  could probably approach the Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\nBut it is not so much that as there are no other non-Communist socialist books recommended in the list of\r\n\r\nmass reading for members of the organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So first we have the Barisan Sosialis which start\r\n\r\noff  by  trying  to betray their  own  Party  in  an\r\n\r\nelection.  Now  in  six months'  time,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have graduated to even higher things.  They\r\n\r\nare  prepared to trade Singapore in the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.KJ. They are getting better and better,  Sir,\r\n\r\nin  accepting the Leninist precept:-  that  is,  high\r\n\r\ntreason and betrayal of one's own country is a  good\r\n\r\ntest  of  a good Communist. So yesterday,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown kept on saying, \"What is  all\r\n\r\nthis talk about Communism - the Communist bogey?  The\r\n\r\nGovernment always brings this in\" and so on. Sir,I\r\n\r\nhave  quoted  what  the  Secretary-General  of   the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis had sworn, before the Red flag  and\r\n\r\nold  Stalin. Then let me quote another document.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  very interesting book. I have a feeling  that\r\n\r\nthis book is going to be a very oft-quoted book.  We\r\n\r\nhave  kept  a few copies in the Library. Here  again\r\n\r\nlet me quote another document by the adviser to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarisan, Mr James Puthucheary. This was a statement\r\n\r\nof  political beliefs which was written again in the\r\n\r\nsolitude of a prison. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When I broke with my political friends in 1951,\r\n\r\nthe  full implications were not clear to me, and  so\r\n\r\nto a large extent hung in mid-air as it were. Though\r\n\r\nI  had  rejected some of what were considered  basic\r\n\r\ntenets  and was critical of Communist regimentation,\r\n\r\nI was unable to reject Weltenschauung.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>`My  return  from Communism was not  in  a  straight\r\n\r\nline.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  suggest, Sir, that the return to Communism is not\r\n\r\nas  straight either. But it does show that when  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis says, \"What is all this talk  about\r\n\r\nCommunism?  All this smear is an attempt to  confuse\r\n\r\nthe  people.\" Mr James Puthucheary is  not  one  of\r\n\r\nthose people who wrote letters to say that all  this\r\n\r\ntalk  about Communist machinations is nonsense.  But\r\n\r\nhere in this document he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`My return from Communism was not in a straight\r\n\r\nline.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>Let me state here, Sir, that we are not fighting the\r\n\r\nCommunists  because  they  are  Communists.  We  are\r\n\r\nfighting   them  because  they  are   actively   and\r\n\r\nconspiratorally  resisting what  Malayan  socialists\r\n\r\nhave  always  believed in - merger between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Federation. The day the Communists, the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  decided to sabotage merger we  took  them\r\n\r\non. The day they betrayed our candidate in Anson  we\r\n\r\ntook  them  on.  Now that the Barisan Sosialis  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to betray Singapore to the P.K.I., we  will\r\n\r\ntake  them on definitely, because we have no  doubts\r\n\r\nnow  that the Barisan Sosialis and their friends are\r\n\r\nseeking no less than the betrayal of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let there be no doubt about our non-Communist\r\n\r\nstand.  So long as the Communists fought for  things\r\n\r\nwhich  we all publicly believe in, so long  as  they\r\n\r\nfought  the colonialists, we were with them. We  had\r\n\r\nno quarrel with them. So long as they fought even as\r\n\r\ntrade  unions for the betterment of the workers,  we\r\n\r\nhad no grudge with them. But the day they decided to\r\n\r\nbetray  their  country, to betray the  ideals  which\r\n\r\nthey said they believe in, that is, Socialism,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen  we  took  them on. So we are not fighting  the\r\n\r\nCommunists because they are Communists, but  because\r\n\r\nthey  are  actively fighting us and our  efforts  to\r\n\r\ncreate   a   democratic,  non-Communist,   socialist\r\n\r\nMalaya. The reason why we are fighting them Js  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  fighting us. They tried  to  stop  things\r\n\r\nwhich  they  had believed in, and to realise  things\r\n\r\nwhich  we have fought for. Once they stand  in  our\r\n\r\nway, then we must fight them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the story, Sir, of the conflict that has\r\n\r\nalways  occurred  between  the  Communists  and  the\r\n\r\nnationalists in every country in Asia which had been\r\n\r\ncolonial and later became independent. There comes a\r\n\r\ntime  when  they will do this - though the  Communists\r\n\r\nmight have joined in the struggle as excellent anti-colonial  fighters, under cover that  they  are  not\r\n\r\nCommunists.  But  once  they  try  to  pervert   the\r\n\r\nnationalist  aims and bend the nationalists  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunist aims, then they come a cropper. Therefore,\r\n\r\nSir,  even in the few short months that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  started off - they started  with  what  they\r\n\r\ncalled  the Barisan Sosialis - they started  with  the\r\n\r\nwrong  name,  a  deceptive name. They  are  not  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis. It is quite clear not  only  from\r\n\r\nwhat  is  said  in the past, but what  is  happening\r\n\r\ntoday - the  worst  thing of all - that  they  have  now\r\n\r\nbecome stool-pigeons of the P.K.I. It is inevitable,\r\n\r\nSir,  when  once you start a political  Party  under\r\n\r\nconditions of betrayal, that is, you betray your own\r\n\r\ncomrades.  That is the genesis of the  Barisan.  And\r\n\r\nthen  they  try to deceive the people by saying  \"We\r\n\r\nare  socialists, non-Communists\", when in fact  they\r\n\r\nare   not.  They  have  proved  it  today  by  tying\r\n\r\nthemselves up, getting instructions, and subject  to\r\n\r\ndiscipline from the P.K.I. As I have said,  we  have\r\n\r\nno  quarrel as to what the P.K.I. does in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThat  is its business. But when the P.K.I. tries  to\r\n\r\ninterfere and intervene in our affairs, then we must\r\n\r\nhit  out  at it, and most of all against  those  who\r\n\r\nlend  themselves  to  be used  as  stool-pigeons  by\r\n\r\nforeign Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, may I say again that we\r\n\r\nare fighting not the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndonesian  people. We are not concerned  with  them\r\n\r\nbecause so far as we know, the Indonesian people  as\r\n\r\nsuch  have  made  it  quite clear  that  as  far  as\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is concerned, they have no objection.  The\r\n\r\nmoment  Malaysia was announced, Dr  Subandrio,  the\r\n\r\nForeign Minister, said, \"Yes, as far as Indonesia is\r\n\r\nconcerned, we have no objection to Malaysia. It is a\r\n\r\nmatter  for the peoples of the Malaysian territories\r\n\r\nto decide.\" So far their stand has been intractable.\r\n\r\nTo  save the Barisan Sosialis or merely because  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis are in great difficulty  - they  have\r\n\r\nlooked  to  the P.K.I., whatever their reasons  are.\r\n\r\nOnce they embark upon what is, to quote Lenin again,\r\n\r\nhigh  treason,  then  the people  of  Malaysia,  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, the people of the Federation,\r\n\r\nwill  have  no doubt of their attitude  towards  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, therefore, Sir, make one final quotation\r\n\r\nbefore I end my speech, I will quote again from  the\r\n\r\nadviser   of   the  Barisan  Sosialis,   Mr   James\r\n\r\nPuthucheary. He had this to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists by infiltrating into open\r\n\r\norganisations have helped in weakening  them.  Their\r\n\r\nactivities  justified the creation of these  powers,\r\n\r\n[that  is,  the  Emergency powers] their  policy  of\r\n\r\ninfiltration  justified  the  use  of  these  powers\r\n\r\nagainst open organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>* * *</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I think is the greatest damage the Communists\r\n\r\narc  doing  to  the  country. They  have  failed  to\r\n\r\nprovide answers [This is most important. This  is  a\r\n\r\nman  who  has returned from Communism. He is  giving\r\n\r\nhis  views.]  They  [that is, the  Communists]  have\r\n\r\nfailed  to provide answers to the country's problems\r\n\r\nand  they  continue to prevent others from providing\r\n\r\nalternative answers.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  is an indictment against the Communists.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  provide the answers. But that is all  right.\r\n\r\nBut   when   they  prevent  others  from   providing\r\n\r\nalternative  answers, \"They have unwittingly\"   - this\r\n\r\nis  very important; this was written in 1957 and  it\r\n\r\nis  true  today of the Barisan Sosialis  - \"They  have\r\n\r\nunwittingly become allies of the long-term  aims  of\r\n\r\nthe Colonial government and Right-wing politicians.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  notice,  Sir,  that since  its  early  days  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis had to run to Eden Hall  to  do  a\r\n\r\ndeal. Though they talk about anti-colonialism and so\r\n\r\non, they are prepared, in such a situation, to do  a\r\n\r\ndeed  with  anybody else. First, the  colonialist - to\r\n\r\nstamp out nationalism. Now the foreign Communists - to\r\n\r\nstamp   out  nationalism.  On  the  basis  of   that\r\n\r\nanalysis,  Sir, Mr James Puthucheary, presently  an\r\n\r\nadviser  to  the Barisan Sosialis, gave this  advice - and very good advice too:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The task of the social democrat seems insuperable.\r\n\r\nBut for any solution it is necessary that Communists\r\n\r\ninside and outside the open organisations have to be \r\n\r\nfought  and  at the same time an even greater  fight\r\n\r\nhas   to  be  waged  against  colonialism  and   its\r\n\r\nsupporters.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Today,  Sir,  the Barisan Sosialis, the  Communists,\r\n\r\nare  the  biggest  supporters of  the  retention  of\r\n\r\nBritish  rule in the Borneo territories, because  by\r\n\r\nbreaking up Malaysia, you leave no alternative  for\r\n\r\nthe  people but to carry on under British rule, both\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and  in  the Borneo  territories.  So\r\n\r\ntherefore he says, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Not to fight the Communists would be to abdicate\r\n\r\nthe   right  to  help  the  country  to,  solve  her\r\n\r\npolitical and economic problems, to watch helplessly\r\n\r\nas the country moves to a civil war.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That   is   the   considered  view  of   Mr   James\r\n\r\nPuthucheary, a man who has returned from  Communism.\r\n\r\nAnd  writing  about  the  Communists  he  knew,  his\r\n\r\ninjunction  was, \"Not to fight the Communists  would\r\n\r\nbe  to  abdicate  the right to help the  country  to\r\n\r\nsolve  her political and economic problems, to watch\r\n\r\nhelplessly as the country moves to a civil war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thesis is that we are fighting for a Malaysia\r\n\r\nto  help  solve  the problems of 10 million  people,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  see no way out to ensure  that  the  10\r\n\r\nmillion   people   become  free,  because   Malaysia\r\n\r\nautomatically ensures the departure of British  rule\r\n\r\nfrom    this    territory,   because   automatically\r\n\r\nsovereignty is transferred to the Malaysian  States;\r\n\r\nthe  British pull out, the new Malaysia States  come\r\n\r\nin. That is the only practical solution that we know\r\n\r\nof  to  ensure the livelihood of 10 million ordinary\r\n\r\npeople.

I  say  the\r\n\r\ntime  has  come  when the Barisan Sosialis  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared, as other Communists in Africa and Asia are\r\n\r\nprepared, to fight the nationalists, and in the long\r\n\r\nrun the nationalists must win.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, after hearing the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture  speak  for  2\u00bd hours, I  feel  that  I  was\r\n\r\nhearing the Voice of America for 2\u00bd hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Aidit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): But I must\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Minister for Culture on being  able\r\n\r\nto  make  such  a  lengthy speech of  such  a  frank\r\n\r\nnature.  The  lengthy  speech of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture, compared with the Four-Year Souvenir of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  all the more reflects the P.A.P. political\r\n\r\nphilosophy  and  policy thoroughly.  It  shows  more\r\n\r\nclearly  here than the Four-Year Souvenir  issue  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. His speech enables everyone to see  more\r\n\r\nclearly  the true nature and colour of the so-called\r\n\r\ntrue  spirit  of  the  so-called  nationalists   and\r\n\r\nsocialists.  It  will enable us to know  their  true\r\n\r\nintention.  The  whole speech of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture can be said to be a nonsensical piece  which\r\n\r\nis  devoid  of any meaning. Afterwards, I will  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the  arguments  he advanced.  They  were  very\r\n\r\nnonsensical indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now reply to the two most important\r\n\r\nallegations  made  against  us  by  the  P.A.P.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, for the past two days, when  debating\r\n\r\nthe  question  of Malaysia, we have  seen  that  the\r\n\r\nMinisters of the P.A.P. and the Assemblymen  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. seem to be very elated. They think that  they\r\n\r\nhave  found two strong points to be used as  weapons\r\n\r\nto deal with us. They think they can crash the heads\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis. The two arguments  which\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncherish as very strong weapons against us are simply\r\n\r\nthis:  First, they say the Barisan Sosialis  support\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  move to liberate West  Irian  from  the\r\n\r\nDutch  colonialists. Therefore, they argue that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis have no reason to oppose the  Tunku\r\n\r\nin  liberating  the  three Bornean  territories  and\r\n\r\nSingapore from British rule. Secondly, they say that\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Executive Committee of the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party  last year approved  a  resolution\r\n\r\ncondemning  and opposing the Greater Malaysia  Plan.\r\n\r\nThe  Barisan Sosialis today are also opposed to  the\r\n\r\nGreater  Malaysia Plan. Therefore,  the  P.A.P. say\r\n\r\nthat the Barisan Sosialis' opposition to the Greater\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan  is complying with the directives  of\r\n\r\nthe Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us examine the first\r\n\r\nallegation  levelled at us by the P.A.P. The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nsay that the Barisan Sosialis are -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Dutchmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): - Dutchmen. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. say that the Dutch propose to let the Papuans\r\n\r\nin  West Irian have self-determination and,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame time, they say the Barisan Sosialis also stress\r\n\r\nthe  point that the three Bornean territories should\r\n\r\nbe given the right of self-determination. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthey  argue  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis'  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  the three Bornean territories is just  like\r\n\r\nthe  attitude  of the Dutch towards West  Irian.  In\r\n\r\nfact, the kind of self-determination right which  is\r\n\r\nbeing discussed now is actually very different  from\r\n\r\nthat. There is some fundamental difference. Here are\r\n\r\ntwo  aspects  of  the  difference.  Firstly,  it  is\r\n\r\nimposed  from  the top, as though it is  a  kind  of\r\n\r\ncharity executed from top to bottom. Another type is\r\n\r\nfrom  the bottom to the top. It is a kind of request\r\n\r\nexpressed  from  below to the  top.  It  has  to  be\r\n\r\nattained through some kind of struggle. It has to be\r\n\r\nfought  for. The Dutch want to give the Papuans  the\r\n\r\nso-called right of self-determination. The intention\r\n\r\nis really to give the right of self-determination to\r\n\r\nthe   puppets  of  the  Dutch,  namely,   the   pro-colonialists.  But the peoples of the three  Bornean\r\n\r\nterritories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemand  constitutional  advance.  They  are  against\r\n\r\nBritish colonial rule. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  right\r\n\r\nof  self-determination is just  like  a  knife.  The\r\n\r\nDutch  want  to hand over this knife to the  Papuans\r\n\r\nwho  are  their  puppets in order to cut  off  their\r\n\r\nrelationship with Indonesia. They intend to give  it\r\n\r\nto  their  puppets  in West Irian.  But  we  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis demand that the  knife  should  be\r\n\r\nhanded  over  to  the people of  the  three  Bornean\r\n\r\nterritories in order to cut off any control that  is\r\n\r\nimposed   on   them  by  the  British  colonialists.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  on  the  question of self-determination,\r\n\r\nthe  stand  of the Barisan Sosialis has  never  been\r\n\r\ncontradictory. It has always been consistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand by the Indonesians to liberate West\r\n\r\nIrian and the question of Malaysia are different  in\r\n\r\nnature  too. Indonesia wants to liberate West  Irian\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Dutch  colonialists. The  purpose  is  to\r\n\r\nensure  that West Irian will not become  a  military\r\n\r\nbase of the Western colonialists in Asia. It is also\r\n\r\nto ensure that the Papuans and the indigenous people\r\n\r\nthere  will  become equal citizens of the Indonesian\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about the Malaysia Plan? According to the\r\n\r\npresent Malaysia Plan, the result of it will be that\r\n\r\nit  will  not  at  all affect the British  interests\r\n\r\nmilitarily and economically. According to  what  has\r\n\r\nbeen disclosed by the Tunku, the realisation of this\r\n\r\nMalaysia Plan will mean the extension of the present\r\n\r\ndefence  agreement  between Malaya  and  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom.  Therefore, under these circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, as a member of S.E.A.T.O., will have\r\n\r\nthe  right  to use the base here. At the same  time,\r\n\r\nanother  result of this Malaysia Plan will  be  that\r\n\r\nthat  the  people in this area will be  affected  in\r\n\r\nthat  they will not become members of an independent\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these are the two fundamental differences\r\n\r\nbetween  Indonesia's liberation of  West  Irian  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  We have all seen how, on the question  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia's claim for West Irian, Western  countries\r\n\r\nlike the United\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKingdom, Australia, and America have taken the  same\r\n\r\nunfriendly attitude towards Indonesia. These Western\r\n\r\npowers  unanimously support the Malaysia Plan.  From\r\n\r\nthis  we  can see that this so-called Malaysia  Plan\r\n\r\nmust  be  a new kind of camouflage to cover  up  the\r\n\r\nreal  intention of the colonialists,  which  is  the\r\n\r\ncontinuance  of their colonial rule.  These  Western\r\n\r\ncolonial  powers will have to adopt some new  facade\r\n\r\nbecause,  at  the  present time,  the  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nvoices  have been so very loud and strong  and  they\r\n\r\nhave  no other alternative. The General Assembly  of\r\n\r\nthe  United  Nations has also approved a  resolution\r\n\r\nappealing for the discontinuation of colonial  rule.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result of such a resolution, the position  of\r\n\r\nthe  Western  powers will become untenable  if  they\r\n\r\ncontinue with their old rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another weapon used by the P.A.P. They say\r\n\r\nthat our stand is the same as that of the Indonesian\r\n\r\nCommunists. Mr Speaker, the question is not one  as\r\n\r\nto  what opinion the Communists have. Everyone  has\r\n\r\neyes  to  see for himself. The Communists have  also\r\n\r\neyes to see for themselves. What the Communists  can\r\n\r\nsee,  can  the others not see too? Must we deny  the\r\n\r\nfact  if  the Communists tell people what they  have\r\n\r\nseen? Does it mean that by doing so it is democracy?\r\n\r\nAre  the P.A.P. advancing such an argument? Everyone\r\n\r\nneeds to know the truth. We must not reject as false\r\n\r\nwhat the Communists say of certain things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has said in this House that what is in the interest of the people may also be advantageous to the Communists. Therefore, the approach to the question of Malaysia cannot be based on the argument that if the Communists oppose this Plan, others must not oppose it too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the factors which have helped us\r\n\r\ncome  to  a decision oil Malaysia are not Communist-inspired.  But  the  interests of  the  millions  of\r\n\r\npeople  in  this  area have led us  to  the  present\r\n\r\nposition  on  this Malaysia Plan. We of the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis have spent a lot of time pointing  out  to\r\n\r\nthis House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   we  cannot  accept  the  White  Paper  merger\r\n\r\nproposals.  We have said that they are  not  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the people of Singapore. In the view  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore, the arrangement of this so-called Malaysia is just the same kind of arrangement\r\n\r\nas  set out in the White Paper merger proposals. The\r\n\r\nMalaysia Plan also does not provide for equal rights\r\n\r\nto  the citizens of Singapore. It also restricts the\r\n\r\nfreedom of the people in travelling. Furthermore, it\r\n\r\nis  detrimental to the development of the  socialist\r\n\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I firmly believe that the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and the three Bornean territories fear\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysia Plan not because they have  heard  the\r\n\r\narguments of the Communists. There are many  reasons\r\n\r\nwhich  have led them to harbour fears and suspicions\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  this Malaysia Plan.  One  of  their\r\n\r\nworries  is  this:  that after the establishment  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  there is the fear that a large number  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore will migrate to  the  other\r\n\r\nterritories. They fear that after the realisation of\r\n\r\nMalaysia  their present economic interest will  meet\r\n\r\nwith    more   intense   competition   from    other\r\n\r\nterritories. They are also worried that the  freedom\r\n\r\nof  religious beliefs will be restricted.  There  is\r\n\r\nthe  further fear that they may be at a disadvantage\r\n\r\non  the question of employment in the civil service.\r\n\r\nThere  is  also  the  fear that they  may  not  have\r\n\r\nadequate  representation in the Central  Parliament.\r\n\r\nThese  fears  exist  because of the  present  living\r\n\r\nconditions  of  the  people  of  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and the prevailing unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation in these two territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are further reasons why they are worried\r\n\r\nabout  this  Malaysia Plan. For instance,  When  the\r\n\r\nTunku  went to London to discuss this Plan with  Mr\r\n\r\nMacmillan,  he disclosed to the reporters  that  the\r\n\r\nfirst  purpose  of this Plan was to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  So  it is not in the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  this area to shake off the rule  of  the\r\n\r\ncolonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku also said in London that if in future the\r\n\r\nBritish  wanted Labuan, in North Borneo, they  could\r\n\r\nuse it as a military base. From this you can see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  even before the Tunku had the right to control\r\n\r\nthe   three  Borneo  territories,  he  had   already\r\n\r\npromised  that Labuan would be handed  over  to  the\r\n\r\nBritish for use as a military base. When the  people\r\n\r\nheard this, they could not help but have suspicions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that today no one is\r\n\r\nopposed to the concept of Malaysia. The question is:\r\n\r\nwhat are the contents of the Malaysia plan? What  is\r\n\r\nits  form?  What steps should be taken  to  approach\r\n\r\nthis  plan  and what kind of arrangement  should  be\r\n\r\ntaken  in  respect  of  time? According  to  present\r\n\r\nindications,  the Governments of Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya want to rush through this plan,\r\n\r\nand this will give cause for the people to have some\r\n\r\ndoubts as to the interests of this plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that the strongest\r\n\r\nParty  in  Sarawak  is the Sarawak  United  People's\r\n\r\nParty.  On  8th  July,  1961, they  issued  a  brief\r\n\r\nannouncement saying that any question which proposes\r\n\r\nunification with Malaya should be decided upon  only\r\n\r\nafter  Sarawak  has decided on its  own  future  and\r\n\r\nafter it has attained independence. We have heard of\r\n\r\na   political  Party  called  the  White  Kalimantan\r\n\r\nPeople's  Party. On 30th November, 1961, this  Party\r\n\r\ncabled  to  London  to protest against  the  Tunku's\r\n\r\ndiscussion  with  Mr Macmillan on the  question  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  I have to stress here that the leader  of\r\n\r\nthis Party which issued this protest is one who  has\r\n\r\nbeen  described  by  our Prime Minister  as  a  non-Communist nationalist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, during these two days of debate we have heard many things about the duties of a socialist. We have also heard the arguments propounded on the keen desire of the socialists and certain other kind-hearted people to rescue the peoples of these territories from British colonial\r\n\r\nrule. Let me ask these so-called socialists: why  do\r\n\r\nthey not want to let the three Borneo territories be\r\n\r\nunited  together,  and  be an independent  political\r\n\r\nunit? Why do they not accept such a concept? Why  do\r\n\r\nthey not agree to the request to let the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree Borneo territories first get independence? Why\r\n\r\ncannot  they  let  the three territories  be  united\r\n\r\ntogether as one independent unit and so come out  of\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule  before talking about  Malaysia  with\r\n\r\nthem? I am surprised, and I feel strange, that these\r\n\r\nso-called   socialists  should  behave  like   elder\r\n\r\nbrothers  rushing forward to protect the peoples  of\r\n\r\nthe three Borneo territories, scrambling to liberate\r\n\r\nthem and force them to adopt the same way of life as\r\n\r\nwe have now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To talk blindly about the safeguards of the rights\r\n\r\nof  the  people  of the three Borneo territories  is\r\n\r\nuseless.  Socialists  must use  concrete  facts  and\r\n\r\nexamples  to  attract  people  to  their  side.   If\r\n\r\nsocialists in Singapore and the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\ncan  raise the standard of living of the peoples  of\r\n\r\nthese  two  territories to  such  a  level  as  that\r\n\r\nexisting  in Elysium, then I believe the peoples  in\r\n\r\nthe  three Borneo territories would be very glad  to\r\n\r\njoin in the Malaysia plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, today the present important task\r\n\r\nof  a  true nationalist and a true socialist is  not\r\n\r\njust to see the expansion of his own territory,  but\r\n\r\nto  concentrate his strength to ensure that  in  his\r\n\r\nown country the workers and farmers can be liberated\r\n\r\nfrom  exploitation  by foreign  capitalists  and  to\r\n\r\nenable  his  own  country  to  stand  firm   as   an\r\n\r\nindependent self-governing country, in the spirit of\r\n\r\nthe Afro-Asian countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister has said that\r\n\r\nmany  Assemblymen  of the Barisan  Sosialis  do  not\r\n\r\nquite understand what is Communism. But on the topic\r\n\r\nof  socialism,  we  have  never  heard  of  such   a\r\n\r\nsocialist  argument as that small nations can  never\r\n\r\nexist by themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before I reply to certain\r\n\r\narguments put forward by the Minister for Culture, I\r\n\r\nwill  say something about the amendment proposed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Anson. We in the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ncannot support this amendment to the motion. We  are\r\n\r\nnot  opposed  to  the concept of  Greater  Malaysia;\r\n\r\nneither are we opposed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  a  plan. But we oppose because the  Tunku,  in\r\n\r\nmoving  his  motion in the Federal Parliament,  said\r\n\r\nclearly that he could not accept Singapore into  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya - if it  meant  giving  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights to the people of  Singapore.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  clearly  that he could only  accept  Singapore\r\n\r\ninto  the Federation as a partner. If the Tunku,  in\r\n\r\nmoving   his   motion,  did  not  make  such   clear\r\n\r\nstatement,  then we would be very much  prepared  to\r\n\r\nsupport  what he said, a Malaysian concept.  I  said\r\n\r\njust now that we are of the opinion that the Greater\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan is after all the same as  the  merger\r\n\r\nproposals contained in the White Paper. So  we  feel\r\n\r\nthat  if,  on  the one hand, we refused  this  White\r\n\r\nPaper  and, on the other hand, accepted the  Greater\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Plan, it would create a lot of  confusion.\r\n\r\nOtherwise  it would mean that we are not sincere  in\r\n\r\nsafeguarding   the  interest  of   the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The P.A.P. like to talk very much about a\r\n\r\nmandate.  But  they  have  forgotten  that  on   the\r\n\r\nquestion of Greater Malaysia, we have no such  thing\r\n\r\nas  a  mandate from the people of Singapore. If they\r\n\r\nare so very much concerned and pay so much attention\r\n\r\nto  the question of a mandate from the people,  then\r\n\r\nthey  should not act in an arbitrary manner and make\r\n\r\ndecisions for the people of Singapore on their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the Minister for Culture\r\n\r\nmentioned two good points in his speech. First,  he\r\n\r\nasked the people of Singapore why there should be  a\r\n\r\nMalaysia  plan; and if there were no Malaysia,  what\r\n\r\nwould  happen to them? Well, we appeal to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  to  think very carefully  about  this\r\n\r\nquestion.  They  must not forget that  it  has  been\r\n\r\nposed  by  the  P.A.P. itself.  If  the  people  can\r\n\r\nvisualise the position in which the P.A.P. will  be\r\n\r\nplaced  in  the absence of Malaysia, then they  will\r\n\r\nunderstand  why the P.A.P. is today very interested,\r\n\r\nenthusiastic  but  worried about  Malaysia.  If  the\r\n\r\npeople can think about this question, then they will\r\n\r\nbe able to find a correct answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture in his speech just now and the Minister for Home Affairs in his speech yesterday stressed the recent talk given by the Prime Minister of England, Mr Macmillan, to the people of England. The U.K. Prime Minister said to his own people that Britain had become a third-class power. Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a fact. Mr\r\n\r\nMacmillan  himself admitted it.  But  when  he  said\r\n\r\nthis,  it did not mean that Britain was prepared  to\r\n\r\ngive up its interest in colonial countries. He said\r\n\r\nsuch things in order to encourage and to arouse  the\r\n\r\nvigilance of the British people and instil  in  them\r\n\r\ngreater  efforts  and that they  should  adopt  more\r\n\r\ncunning  means  to  deal with  the  world  situation\r\n\r\ntoday. Mr Macmillan said this not only with a  view\r\n\r\nto encouraging his own people to accept and face the\r\n\r\nchallenge  of  Communism, but also with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nreminding  his  own people of the  economic  rivalry\r\n\r\ncoming  from America, Japan and other North European\r\n\r\ncountries.  And  so  to explain  the  words  of  Mr\r\n\r\nMacmillan  as an automatic and voluntary  withdrawal\r\n\r\nof the colonial influence is tantamount to deceiving\r\n\r\nthe  people  and the world on behalf of the  British\r\n\r\ncolonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture just now also touched upon certain strange theories. According to his theory, small countries will not be able to survive. They will not be able to have a stable currency. If his theory is accepted, then I think countries such as Switzerland and Belgium, should not have existed at all. They should better have been merged with\r\n\r\nGermany  or America. This kind of argument does  not\r\n\r\nhold water. I think this kind of argument is similar\r\n\r\nto  the  argument used by Hitler and the Fascist.  I\r\n\r\nhope very sincerely that I will be able to hear from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance later on. I hope  he  will\r\n\r\nreply  from  the  economic  point  of  view  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical  analysis as to how and why a big  country\r\n\r\nwith  large  tracts  of land  should  not  have  any\r\n\r\neconomic  problems. His colleague, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture,  seems to be telling us that if  the  three\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories can be merged  and  united  with\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaya, then there will be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery  chance of prosperity and everything  will  be\r\n\r\nall  right.  But the fact remains that even  if  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia   plan   materialises,   what   about   the\r\n\r\nresources,  the  area  of land and  the  population?\r\n\r\nWell,  all  this taken together will not  be  bigger\r\n\r\nthan  America,  India or Australia. So  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance will be able to enlighten us as\r\n\r\nto  why  in  these big countries which are  full  of\r\n\r\nnatural  resources, there is still  in  existence  a\r\n\r\nvery great unemployment problem. There are still  in\r\n\r\nexistence economic problems. Why? Why is that people\r\n\r\nin these countries are not able to live in paradise?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It is not a Communist country!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture said a great deal with only one\r\n\r\naim.

Not everyone\r\n\r\nwill  accept this dictum of Gibbon as true  of  all\r\n\r\nhistory of all mankind. But in certain countries and\r\n\r\nat certain times, the conduct of certain men is such\r\n\r\nas   to  lend  support  to  Gibbon's  definition  of\r\n\r\nhistory. I believe it applies to our own country  at\r\n\r\nthe  present  time and in regard to the  conduct  of\r\n\r\ncertain  people. The people I have in mind are  none\r\n\r\nother  than the Communists and their stooges in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis;  and the episodes  which  I  will\r\n\r\nrelate  concern their sayings and actions in  regard\r\n\r\nto the Greater Malaysia Plan. I propose to show what\r\n\r\ncrimes  the  Communists and  their  stooges  in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis were prepared to commit  to  fight\r\n\r\nMalaysia,   their  folly  in  so   doing   and   the\r\n\r\nmisfortunes that await them now that they  had  done\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This house has been treated, in this debate on\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  to  the  usual Barisan Sosialis  fare  of\r\n\r\nwilful  misrepresentation of truths, large  servings\r\n\r\nof  half-truths  generously  spiced  with  downright\r\n\r\nuntruths.  But I am not concerned with the  tracking\r\n\r\ndown    of    each    and    everyone    of    these\r\n\r\nmisrepresentations. To do so would be  a  monumental\r\n\r\ntask. Nor shall I dwell at length on the general  or\r\n\r\nspecific  arguments Which they have put forward.  My\r\n\r\ncolleagues will deal with them in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to go behind the facade of the arguments\r\n\r\nwhich  they have put forward, hut which they do  not\r\n\r\nreally   believe  in, and  probe  into   the   real\r\n\r\nmotivations  which  have led  them  to  oppose  both\r\n\r\nmerger and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My narrative begins on Saturday, 27th of May, when\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  of the  Federation  of  Malaya\r\n\r\naddressed the Foreign Correspondents Association  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. He delivered a lengthy speech in which he\r\n\r\ndescribed  some of the problems and achievements  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government since Merdeka. But  there\r\n\r\nwere  two significant passages in his speech.  These\r\n\r\npassages  were both brief. The first was a  friendly\r\n\r\nreference to Singapore made in such a way as to give\r\n\r\nhopes   for  the  first  time  that  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  was prepared to take in Singapore  in  a\r\n\r\nmerger.  Prophetically, the  Tunku  seemed  to  have\r\n\r\nforeseen  trouble  with the Communists  over  merger\r\n\r\nbecause it demanded a loyalty to the Malayan way  of\r\n\r\nlife.  May I quote the first significant passage  of\r\n\r\nthe Tunku's statement (Sunday Times, 28th May):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`For us in Malaya, and I include Singapore in my\r\n\r\nremarks, loyalty to the Malayan ideal of the way  of\r\n\r\nlife  is fundamental. There can be no half-way house\r\n\r\nin  loyalty. No one ever becomes happy by trying  to\r\n\r\nmake  the best of two worlds. People who think  they\r\n\r\nare  trying  to ensure the future by  trying  to  be \r\n\r\nfriendly  with the communists on the  one  hand  and\r\n\r\nwith the Governments of Federation and Singapore  on\r\n\r\nthe  other, are sure to end up losing one way or the\r\n\r\nother.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second passage consists of two sentences. But\r\n\r\nit  is  these  two  sentences which  gave  birth  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia not merely as a theoretical concept but  as\r\n\r\na  practical  proposition. May  I  read  the  second\r\n\r\npassage. The Tunku said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sooner or later she (the Federation of Malaya)\r\n\r\nshould  have an understanding with Britain  and  the\r\n\r\npeoples  of  the  territories of Singapore,  Borneo,\r\n\r\nBrunei  and Sarawak. It is premature for me  to  say\r\n\r\nnow  how  this closer understanding can  be  brought\r\n\r\nabout,  but  it is inevitable that they should  look\r\n\r\nahead  to this objective and think of a plan whereby\r\n\r\nthese territories can be brought closer together  in\r\n\r\npolitical and economic cooperation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That was all the Tunku said on Malaysia, but it  set\r\n\r\nin  train  a  series of events which  were  to  have\r\n\r\nprofound and far-reaching consequences. The  Tunku's\r\n\r\nproposal  on Malaysia, tentative though  it  was  at\r\n\r\nthat time, was one of the principal factors that led\r\n\r\nto the open break between the Communists and the non-Communists in the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tunku spoke on the 27th May, some 2\u00bd weeks\r\n\r\nbefore nomination day for the Anson by-election. The\r\n\r\nnext development was a statement signed by six trade\r\n\r\nunion   leaders   in  the  Communist   open   front\r\n\r\norganisation  headed  by Mr Lim  Ching  Siong.  The\r\n\r\nstatement  was  published on the 3rd June.  By  that\r\n\r\ntime,  general interest in Malaysia had been aroused\r\n\r\nnot only in Singapore but in all five territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement of these six trade union leaders, if\r\n\r\ntaken  at  its  face value, was unexceptionable.  It\r\n\r\npledged the support of the unions in the by-election\r\n\r\nfor  the  P.A.P. on the grounds of its anti-colonial\r\n\r\nrecord.  It then went on to say that the six leaders\r\n\r\nwere  convinced that the most practical solution  to\r\n\r\nthe  present  political setbacks  lies  in  the  new\r\n\r\nconstitution.  They  further  said  and  here  I  am\r\n\r\nquoting  the actual words as recorded in the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes, 3rd of June: \"What we are clamouring for this\r\n\r\ntime  is  a  genuinely full internal self-government\r\n\r\nnot  only  in  name  but also in fact.  A  popularly\r\n\r\nelected  Government must exercise  all  rights  over\r\n\r\nmatters  of internal security. The Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil must be abolished.\" There was absolutely  no\r\n\r\nreference  to Malaysia, although Malaysia  was  then\r\n\r\nthe burning political topic of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming as it did on the eve of a critical by-election, the statement was of grave importance. We\r\n\r\ncan  discount its face value but we must probe  into\r\n\r\nits  inner meaning. When Malaysia was the main issue\r\n\r\nof   the  day  the  silence  on  this  subject   was\r\n\r\nsignificant.  It  was obvious that the  message  was\r\n\r\nintended  to be conveyed to the P.A.P. non-Communist\r\n\r\ngroup  that the condition of the support  which  Mr\r\n\r\nLim  Ching Siong and his trade unions were  prepared\r\n\r\nto  give  to  the  P.A.P. was that  we  must  ignore\r\n\r\nMalaysia as an issue in the by-election, instead  we\r\n\r\nshould aim for internal self-government as the  next\r\n\r\nstage  of  our constitutional development  with  the\r\n\r\nlocal   Government  having  powers   over   internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.  In  plain words, what the Communists  had\r\n\r\ntold us was simply this: \"Do not support Malaysia or\r\n\r\nelse we shall kick your teeth down your throat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. took some time to ponder over the real\r\n\r\nmeaning of the statement. It became clear to us that\r\n\r\non   this  issue,  if  both  sides  maintain   their\r\n\r\nrespective  stands,  there  must  eventually  be   a\r\n\r\nparting  of  ways. The Communists were  clearly  not\r\n\r\ninterested in merger or Malaysia because they feared\r\n\r\nthat  a  strong central government would take action\r\n\r\nto  curb  them. They wanted Singapore to be isolated\r\n\r\nunder  conditions which would permit them to develop\r\n\r\nit into a Communist stronghold in South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th June the Deputy Prime Minister declared\r\n\r\nthe  stand of the P.A.P. on this issue. He said that\r\n\r\nin  the  1963  constitutional talks, we intended  to\r\n\r\nseek  independence through merger  under  conditions\r\n\r\nwhich would give Singapore autonomy in education and\r\n\r\nlabour.  He further indicated that if Malaysia  were\r\n\r\nto speed up merger, then the P.A.P. would support it\r\n\r\nin  principle. In plain language, the reply we  gave\r\n\r\nto  the  Communists was, in effect, \"you  chaps  can\r\n\r\ntake a running jump off Clifford Pier.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So nomination day, the 10th June, came around with\r\n\r\nthe two sides having taken positions - the P.A.P. for\r\n\r\nindependence through merger within Malaysia if need\r\n\r\nbe; the Communists for the continuation of\r\n\r\ncolonialism in Singapore provided the British were\r\n\r\nprepared to relinquish control over internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 24th June, Mr Lim Ching Siong wrote a\r\n\r\nletter to the Straits Times and underlined his\r\n\r\noriginal point. He said and I quote from the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes, 24th June, page 10;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Colonialism makes itself felt in Singapore via\r\n\r\nthe Internal Security Council. We have found it\r\n\r\nnecessary to point the way ahead more concretely by\r\n\r\nour claim for the abolition of the Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil and the achievement of full Internal self-government.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there are no two ways about it, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, The P.A.P. won the elections in 1959, and the\r\n\r\nmain political platform was that we shall attempt to\r\n\r\nachieve independence through merger as the next\r\n\r\nconstitutional step for Singapore. In the by-election the Communists tried to pressure us into\r\n\r\ngoing back on the word that we had given, to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelectorate and instead have a more limited target as\r\n\r\nthe next constitutional step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the by-election progressed (the two sides having\r\n\r\ntaken  their  respective  positions)  a  series   of\r\n\r\nstrange  events occurred in Singapore. On  the  26th\r\n\r\nJune three British Governors flew in from the Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories. The ostensible purpose of  their  visit\r\n\r\nwas  stated  to  be a discussion over  the  Malaysia\r\n\r\nproposals.  After three or four days, the  Governors\r\n\r\ndeparted as ostentatiously as they had arrived. By a\r\n\r\ncoincidence, Tunku Abdul Rahman paid a visit to  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories at about this time. A  few  days\r\n\r\nlater the Earl of Selkirk left Singapore, ostensibly\r\n\r\nfor  London  to discuss the Malaysia proposals  with\r\n\r\nCabinet Ministers in London. But I have heard since,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, that the Earl of  Selkirk  never\r\n\r\nwent  much further than Rangoon. Be that as it  may,\r\n\r\nthese  ostentatious movements of  the  British  pro-consuls  had  the effect that the British  intended.\r\n\r\nThe  Communists became convinced that agreement  had\r\n\r\nbeen  reached between the Governments of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe Federation and Great Britain over Malaysia. They\r\n\r\nbecame  visibly more and more agitated as  the  days\r\n\r\npassed   by.   This  agitation  spread   to   former\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries of the Government who have\r\n\r\nnow  defected to the Barisan Sosialis and  who  were\r\n\r\nthen   under  very  heavy  pressure  from  Communist\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Parliamentary Secretaries implored their\r\n\r\nMinisters  to  let them into the secret.  They  were\r\n\r\nconvinced that the Malaysia Plan had been worked out\r\n\r\nin  detail  and that the agreement had been  signed,\r\n\r\nsealed  and  delivered. Each time they  entered  the\r\n\r\noffice  of  a  Minister, they  would  look  somewhat\r\n\r\nsuspiciously at his safe obviously wondering whether\r\n\r\nthe secret document was locked up there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, events hotted up outside. On the\r\n\r\n8th of July, the General Employees Union - the largest\r\n\r\nof  the Communist open front trade unions -  announced\r\n\r\nits  full agreement and support for the stand of the\r\n\r\nsix trade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunionists led by Mr Lim Ching Siong in their demand\r\n\r\nfor  a  genuinely  complete internal self-government\r\n\r\nand  the abolition of the Internal Security Council.\r\n\r\nThere  was  to  be  no  nonsense  about  merger   or\r\n\r\nMalaysia. The statement also said that this  minimum\r\n\r\ndemand should be obtained at the 1963 constitutional\r\n\r\ntalks in London between Great Britain and Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  when  the  time  is  ripe  and  the  conditions\r\n\r\nconducive,  then we should advance another  step  to\r\n\r\nachieve  merger. No definition of what is  meant  by\r\n\r\n\"when the time is ripe and the conditions conducive\"\r\n\r\nwas attempted in the statement, but having heard the\r\n\r\nexposition   of  my  colleague,  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCulture,  on Communist double-talk, I think  we  can\r\n\r\nattempt a shrewd guess as to exactly what they  mean\r\n\r\nby these words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, until then, the Communists and the non-Communists in the P.A.P. had avoided a frontal\r\n\r\nclash.  The  Communist had hitherto  only  withdrawn\r\n\r\nsupport  from  the P.A.P. in the Anson  by-election.\r\n\r\nBut  on  the 11th of July, the long-delayed  head-on\r\n\r\ncollision  took  place  and this  occurred,  of  all\r\n\r\nplaces,  at  the University of Malaya.  The  Student\r\n\r\nSocialist  Club  held a forum on  merger  which  was\r\n\r\ndistinguished  by  bitter recrimination  between  S.\r\n\r\nWoodhull on the side of the Communists and Mr Devan\r\n\r\nNair speaking for the non-Communists of the P.A.P. I\r\n\r\ndo  not wish to go into the details of that forum as\r\n\r\nthe  subject  of  the  debate  was  merger  and  not\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this open clash, the Communists decided to\r\n\r\nintervene in a big way to fight the P.A.P. at Anson.\r\n\r\nThey  had  been  alarmed that  their  withdrawal  of\r\n\r\nsupport from the P.A.P. and their indirect attack on\r\n\r\nthe  policies  of the Government did  not  have  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  they  wanted. They decided  then  that\r\n\r\nwhatever the cost they must ensure the defeat of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. candidate who was one of their colleagues  in\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union movement and a former Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  T.U.C. Central Council of which the six leaders\r\n\r\nwere  members.  So on the 14th of  July,  six  trade\r\n\r\nunionists enlarged the issue and laid great emphasis\r\n\r\non four points which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  had  earlier mentioned in the  course  of  the\r\n\r\nAnson  by-election.  These  four  points  were:  (1)\r\n\r\nrelease  all  political detainees  immediately;  (2)\r\n\r\nscrap  the  Internal Security Council and  institute\r\n\r\nfull  internal  self-government;  (3)  assist  in  a\r\n\r\nspeedy reunification of the trade union movement and\r\n\r\ngrant  citizenship and franchise to those  loyal  to\r\n\r\nthe anti-colonial struggle; and (4) allow freedom of\r\n\r\nPress,  speech,  assembly, etc. At  the  same  time,\r\n\r\neight  P.A.P. Assemblymen were induced to commit  an\r\n\r\nact  of  gross treachery and betrayal. They  sent  a\r\n\r\nletter   to  the  Party  Chairman  asking   that   a\r\n\r\nconference  of  Party branches be  held  to  discuss\r\n\r\ncertain matters. There was nothing wrong in this  if\r\n\r\nthey  really  believed what they  stated,  that  is,\r\n\r\nthere   was  inadequate  consultation  between   the\r\n\r\nleadership  and the rank and file in the Party.  But\r\n\r\nthese  eight Assemblymen, beaded by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, arranged to get the widest publicity for\r\n\r\nthis  letter  two  days  before  polling  day.  They\r\n\r\nreleased it to the Press. Their intention was clear.\r\n\r\nJust  two days before polling day, they deliberately\r\n\r\nlaunched  this  treacherous  assault  on  the  Party\r\n\r\nclearly  in the hope and expectation that  it  would\r\n\r\nhave  an adverse effect on our chances in the  Anson\r\n\r\nby-election. There is a significant passage in  this\r\n\r\nletter which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We agree with the six trade union members in\r\n\r\ntheir  advocacy  of  the four minimum  anti-colonial\r\n\r\nmeasures  and the minimum constitutional demand  for\r\n\r\ngenuinely full internal self-government by 1963.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  final act of betrayal had the effect that  was\r\n\r\nintended. The candidate met with defeat though by  a\r\n\r\npoor  margin. The number of voters who were confused\r\n\r\nby  this  treachery and abstained  from  voting  was\r\n\r\nthree times the margin of defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists had in the meantime launched an all-out assault on the organisation of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  were  approached  and  pressured   into\r\n\r\ndenouncing  the  Party and in particular  the  Party\r\n\r\nleadership.  Organising Secretaries  became  special\r\n\r\ntargets   of   pressure  and  intimidation.   Branch\r\n\r\nCommittee  members were similarly worked  on.  Large\r\n\r\nnumbers of them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuccumbed  to  pressure, persuation or intimidation.\r\n\r\nThe  fortunes of the Party were then at  the  lowest\r\n\r\nebb  in its history. It had suffered in two critical\r\n\r\nby-elections. The Party organisation was in a  state\r\n\r\nof  shambles  due to the defection of  most  of  its\r\n\r\nOrganising  Secretaries and substantial  numbers  of\r\n\r\nits   Branch   Committees.  The  loyalty   of   many\r\n\r\nAssemblymen and Parliamentary Secretaries could  not\r\n\r\nbe  counted upon. The Communists had made good their\r\n\r\nthreat to deliver a kick in the teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, by all accounts, the Government should\r\n\r\nhave fallen and general elections taken place, which\r\n\r\nwas   the  object  of  this  whole  operation.   And\r\n\r\naccordingly, three days after polling day,  we  find\r\n\r\nthe  great  anti-colonial heroes -  Messrs. Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong,  S.  Woodhull,  Fong  Swee  Suan  and  J.  J.\r\n\r\nPuthucheary  - going to Eden Hall to seek an interview\r\n\r\nwith  the  Earl of Selkirk. Doubtless they were  now\r\n\r\nfully convinced that the P.A.P. Government had  been\r\n\r\ndealt a mortal blow and they were ready to take over\r\n\r\nthe  reins of Government. The famous Eden Hall  tea-party  was  not  the first occasion on  which  these\r\n\r\ngreat  anti-colonialists exchanged views  and  drank\r\n\r\ntea  with  representatives of the British  Raj.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has already given an account of  how\r\n\r\nover  a  period of time the officials  of  the  U.K.\r\n\r\nCommission  had  been cultivating these  people.  He\r\n\r\nalso explained that the British on their part wanted\r\n\r\nthe  Communists to believe that they can  take  over\r\n\r\npower  in  Singapore  provided they  play  the  game\r\n\r\nconstitutionally  and  provided   they   leave   the\r\n\r\nmilitary  bases  alone. In the British  calculation,\r\n\r\nonce the Communists believed it, they would then  be\r\n\r\nbold  enough  to leave the protecting  wing  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and launch out on their own, if necessary, in\r\n\r\nconflict  with the P.A.P., which they were confident\r\n\r\nof  scrubbing  out. Now the British had  sensed  the\r\n\r\nconflict of policy and views of these two groups - the\r\n\r\nnon-Communists and the Communists in the P.A.P. over\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  They decided to exploit this conflict  to\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  and in so doing they depended  on  the\r\n\r\nsuspicious  nature of the Communists and their  fear\r\n\r\nof  Greater Malaysia. Viewing matters in retrospect,\r\n\r\nI am led to the conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  ostentatious arrivals and  departures  of\r\n\r\nGovernors  and High Commissioners staged during  the\r\n\r\nAnson by-election was merely a British ruse to  draw\r\n\r\nout the Communists. Certainly in my discussions with\r\n\r\nMinisters  of  the Government of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  I  am unable to see any reference  to  what\r\n\r\nthese  Governors had discussed, the policy they  had\r\n\r\ndefined,  or even any clarification of what happened\r\n\r\nduring that period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Communists had foolishly allowed themselves\r\n\r\nto  be  deceived  into believing that  Malaysia  was\r\n\r\nalready  at hand and that all arrangements had  been\r\n\r\nfixed.  And they were going to be fixed. As a result\r\n\r\nof  this  belief, they went berserk. And so on  18th\r\n\r\nJuly  they  saw  the British Supremo at  Eden  Hall,\r\n\r\ndoubtless to find out what the next step should  be,\r\n\r\nnow  that  they  thought that the  P.A.P. had  been\r\n\r\ndelivered  a knockout punch. Sir, unfortunately  for\r\n\r\nthem the non-Communist P.A.P., whom they had derided\r\n\r\nas  soft  and  petty  bourgeois,  possessed  greater\r\n\r\nstaying  powers  than they had suspected.  Far  from\r\n\r\ncollapsing, we decided to stand up and slug  it  out\r\n\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we pondered over the statements of the Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  Six  of 3rd June, we had decided that  should\r\n\r\nthere  be  a  parting of ways between the Communists\r\n\r\nand  the non-Communists in the Party, then the issue\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia and merger was from our point  of  view\r\n\r\nthe  best possible one on which to part company. All\r\n\r\ngenuine  nationalists want to see the  growth  of  a\r\n\r\ngreat   united  prosperous  nation  with   a   large\r\n\r\npopulation   and   extensive   national   resources.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  lends  itself naturally as an  independent\r\n\r\nsucessor State to the former British Empire in  this\r\n\r\npart  of the world. For the Communists to break with\r\n\r\nus on this issue was to force them eventually into a\r\n\r\nposition  of  isolation from the Malayan nationalist\r\n\r\nmovement.   Their   pretensions   to   be   national\r\n\r\nrevolutionary leaders would then be exposed. I shall\r\n\r\ndiscuss  later the absurd and contradictory position\r\n\r\nto which the Communists and their stooges in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  have  been  reduced  in  opposing\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  Now, when the Communists found that  they\r\n\r\nhad  failed  to capture and destroy the  Party,  and\r\n\r\nfailed  to  topple  the  Government,  they  had   no\r\n\r\nalternative  but  to  group  themselves  and   their\r\n\r\nsympathisers together in a separate Party named  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  or  Socialist  Front.   A   more\r\n\r\nappropriate name, of course, is Barisan Komunis,  or\r\n\r\nCommunist Front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists then realised that in opposing\r\n\r\nmerger   and  Malaysia,  they  had  made  a  serious\r\n\r\npolitical blunder. So they tried to wriggle  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  position by pretending that they wanted merger.\r\n\r\nBut  the conditions which they laid down for  merger\r\n\r\nwere  carefully calculated to be such that they were\r\n\r\nunacceptable to the Federation Government, and known\r\n\r\nto  be unacceptable to the Federation Government  by\r\n\r\nthe Communists who proposed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Malaysia, it was during Anson that they\r\n\r\nstated  that  Malaysia was not part  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nelection programme, and we therefore had no business\r\n\r\nto  give  it support. Subsequently even on  Malaysia\r\n\r\nthey changed their stand. On 30th August the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis issued a statement clarifying the position.\r\n\r\nThe  statement was signed by the Chairman. It  is  a\r\n\r\ndocument  of  considerable importance. I  intend  to\r\n\r\nread  a  fairly lengthy quotation from the statement\r\n\r\nas published in the Straits Times of 30th August. On\r\n\r\npage 18, the Barisan Sosialis stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The way ahead for real reunification was in one\r\n\r\nof two directions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. An immediate full and complete merger with\r\n\r\nSingapore  joining the Federation as  a  constituent\r\n\r\nState, like Penang or Malacca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. As an autonomous unit within a confederation\r\n\r\nwith Borneo territories coming in when possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>* * *</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with Malaysia, the statement said that as\r\n\r\na  stage to eventual merger, Barisan Sosialis  would\r\n\r\naccept   a   constitutional   arrangement   for    a\r\n\r\nconfederation  within which Singapore  would  be  an\r\n\r\nautonomous  unit,  with full  autonomy  in  internal\r\n\r\nmatters,  including internal security, and conceding\r\n\r\nby treaty the fields of external affairs and defence\r\n\r\nto the Federation Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative and constitutional difficulties\r\n\r\nin  the way of achieving merger or confederation may\r\n\r\ncause  some  delay, but while this was  going  on  a\r\n\r\ngreat  anti-colonial struggle must  be  launched  to\r\n\r\nabolish the Internal Security Council and wrest  the\r\n\r\nright  of self-determination from the colonial power\r\n\r\nby 1963.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, a great anti-colonial struggle must\r\n\r\nbe  launched  in  order  to  ensure  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nremains a colony by 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us ponder on the implications\r\n\r\nof  this statement. I will not deal with the section\r\n\r\non  merger with the Federation, as this has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  debated at length in this Chamber. On Malaysia\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis accepted the idea of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nprovided: the Constitution of Malaysia was  a  loose\r\n\r\none,  namely, a confederation. As an aside,  I  must\r\n\r\nsay and I must confess with some surprise, that none\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  Sosialis  speakers  seem  to  have\r\n\r\nremembered  this  important policy  statement  which\r\n\r\nthey  issued  last August. Within this confederation\r\n\r\nSingapore  would be an autonomous unit.  Here  again\r\n\r\nthe familiar refrain occurs  - an autonomous unit with\r\n\r\nfull autonomy in internal matters including internal\r\n\r\nsecurity.  But more important, the Barisan  did  not\r\n\r\nregard    this   confederation   with   the   Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories as a matter of any urgency. There was no\r\n\r\nneed  to hurry. \"What we must do,\" according to this\r\n\r\nstatement,  \"was  to have internal  self-government\r\n\r\nwith   the   abolition  of  the  Internal   Security\r\n\r\nCouncil.\"  So once again they turned to their  first\r\n\r\nlove.  In fact, the only love, when we come to that,\r\n\r\nis a semi-colonial Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal security has clearly become an obsession\r\n\r\nwith the Communists and their stooges in the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.  They seem to be entranced and  hypnotized\r\n\r\nby this subject. Of course, everybody knows that for\r\n\r\nthem this is the real heart of the matter. They  are\r\n\r\nnot   worried   about  citizenship  or   labour   or\r\n\r\neducation,  though they pretend to be so.  They  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  drop labour and education,  ditch  the\r\n\r\nworkers and the Chinese schools any time in exchange\r\n\r\nfor  internal  security in the hope that  this  will\r\n\r\nsave their own skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Communist  socialists  who  do  not  depend   on\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  Communists and  their  open  front\r\n\r\norganisations  for  political  power  have  a  clear\r\n\r\nconscience  in these matters. They are not  troubled\r\n\r\nby  special powers which the Government must have in\r\n\r\nsecurity  matters,  for they  know  that  these  are\r\n\r\nintended to deal with Communist subversion, not with\r\n\r\ndemocratic socialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is the net result that the Communists\r\n\r\nhave  achieved as a result of their policy and stand\r\n\r\non  Malaysia? As I have demostrated conclusively, it\r\n\r\nwas  motivated purely by fear over internal security\r\n\r\nmatters. The first result is their breakway from the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  When they thought that Malaysia was  already\r\n\r\nin  the  bag, they came to the conclusion  that  the\r\n\r\nonly  way  to  stop it was to break the  Government.\r\n\r\nThen  they  would take over the reins of  Government\r\n\r\nand undo the whole arrangement on Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first result of this policy was the open break\r\n\r\nwith the non-Communist Left. We of the non-Communist\r\n\r\nLeft felt, even in our moments of dire anxiety after\r\n\r\nAnson,  profoundly relieved at their departure  from\r\n\r\nour  ranks  over a dispute on a plainly  nationalist\r\n\r\nissue.  While  they are attempting  to  portray  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government as reactionary, pro-colonial,  and\r\n\r\nsingularly  hostile  towards them,  they  must  have\r\n\r\nrealised  that during the period that they  were  in\r\n\r\npartnership  with us, they were able to  consolidate\r\n\r\ntheir position in the trade union field and in rural\r\n\r\nand  cultural  organisations. We as a  non-Communist\r\n\r\ngovernment  naturally had to take certain safeguards\r\n\r\nto ensure that their consolidation was not too solid\r\n\r\nand  their expansion not too rapid. But I would  say\r\n\r\nthat under the P.A.P. they had it so good. They  had\r\n\r\nno  fear of being repressed. Now that they have left\r\n\r\nus,  they  must  fend for themselves  and  face  the\r\n\r\nfuture themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second result is their political isolation in\r\n\r\nall  national issues, of which the issue of Malaysia\r\n\r\nis  an outstanding example. In their desperation  to\r\n\r\nseek  cover,  the Communists have even attempted  to\r\n\r\nmake use of non-political\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight-wing   organisations,  such  as  the   Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber  of Commerce, the Chinese guilds and  clans'\r\n\r\nassociations.  En  this  effort  they  have   failed\r\n\r\ndismally.  I  think  I have briefly  dwelt  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject in this House on a previous occasion when  I\r\n\r\ndescribed Round 5 between the Communists and the non-Communists in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third result is that the Communists are placed\r\n\r\nin  a  completely  false position on  the  important\r\n\r\npolitical  issues  of the day.  Sir,  I  referred  a\r\n\r\nmoment  ago to the absurd and contradictory position\r\n\r\nto  which  they  have  been reduced  on  nationalist\r\n\r\nissues, such as Malaysia. My colleague, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Culture, has rightly called them the Dutchmen of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The Dutch wanted the principle  of  self-determination  to be observed in  West  Irian  as  a\r\n\r\nmeans of delaying independence for West Irian by the\r\n\r\ntransfer to an independent Indonesian government. In\r\n\r\nexactly  the  same way, the Barisan Sosialis  wanted\r\n\r\nthe principle of self-determination to be applied in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  in  respect of the Borneo territories.  We\r\n\r\nhave  had that said in so many plain words by  their\r\n\r\nChairman,  the  Member for Queenstown.  Whereas  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore and the P.A.P. want independence\r\n\r\nand  merger, the Communists and their stooges in the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  have  consistently  pressed   for\r\n\r\ninternal self-government provided that they can save\r\n\r\ntheir own skins under a semi-colonial Singapore, and\r\n\r\nthey want to frustrate Malaysia by appealing to  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of self-determination which they  roundly\r\n\r\ndenounced when proposed by the Dutch for West Irian.\r\n\r\nDo  they  not  understand  the  absurdity  of  their\r\n\r\nposition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that the Communists have allowed\r\n\r\nthemselves  to be reduced to such a pathetic  state?\r\n\r\nStudents  of  the  history of the  Asian  revolution\r\n\r\nwould not be surprised at this. This is nothing  new\r\n\r\nand  there are parallels in other countries in Asia.\r\n\r\nMay  I  refer  to  just one of them?  This  occurred\r\n\r\nduring World War II in India. When the war broke out\r\n\r\nin October 1939, the Indian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNationalist  leaders headed by  Mahatma  Gandhi  and\r\n\r\nPandit  Nehru  opposed India's entry into  the  war.\r\n\r\nThey stated that this war did not concern them.  The\r\n\r\nCommunist  Party of India too at that time  declared\r\n\r\nthat the war was an imperialist war, that is to say,\r\n\r\na war between capitalist countries in a dispute over\r\n\r\nimperial possessions. Both the nationalists and  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  in India were locked up as a  result  of\r\n\r\ntheir opposition to the British war effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the Soviet Union entered the war in 1941,\r\n\r\nthe  Indian  Communist Party performed an  immediate\r\n\r\npolitical somersault. The imperialist war became  an\r\n\r\nanti-Fascist  war  because the Soviet  Union,  their\r\n\r\nideological   fatherland,  was  attacked   by   Nazi\r\n\r\nGermany.  The  Indian Communists were then  released\r\n\r\nfrom  gaol to collaborate with the British  Imperial\r\n\r\nGovernment in India to support the war effort, while\r\n\r\nthe  nationalist leaders remained in gaol. And I  am\r\n\r\ntold,  Mr Speaker, Sir, by Indian students  whom  I\r\n\r\nmet  in  England, that at that time the  nationalist\r\n\r\nleaders in Congress were trying to mount strikes  to\r\n\r\nstop  production and injure the British War  effort.\r\n\r\nBut the Communist organised strike breakers in a big\r\n\r\nway  to  help  the Imperial masters and  defeat  the\r\n\r\nworkers   led   by  the  nationalist  leaders.   The\r\n\r\nsubservience  of the National Communist  Parties  to\r\n\r\nforeign  causes  and  foreign  governments  is  well\r\n\r\nknown. On Malaysia, it is becoming more apparent now\r\n\r\nthat  the stand of the Communist and the stooges  in\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis is dictated not only  by  the\r\n\r\ndesire  for  self-preservation,  but  also  by   the\r\n\r\nstrategy of Communist Parties abroad. The opposition\r\n\r\nto  Malaysia by our local Communists runs so closely\r\n\r\nto the policy of the Indonesian Communist Party. The\r\n\r\ndeclaration  of  the  P.K.I.  (Indonesian   Communist\r\n\r\nParty)   on  the  subject  has  only  been  recently\r\n\r\npublished and it deserves the closest study.  It  is\r\n\r\nnow becoming clear to everyone how close the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   position   on   Malaysia   follows    the\r\n\r\ndeclaration  of the P.K.I. Is this a coincidence  or\r\n\r\nis  it  the  result  of contacts and  organisational\r\n\r\narrangements between the Communists in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Communists in Indonesia? This is a\r\n\r\nsubject that deserves the closest attention. We know\r\n\r\nfor a fact that last month, important members of the\r\n\r\nCommunist    front   organisations   in   Singapore,\r\n\r\nincluding   the  Vice  Chairman  of  Party   Rakyat,\r\n\r\nattended   an  important  political  conference   in\r\n\r\nDjakarta,  at  which leading members of  the  P.K.I.\r\n\r\nwere present. Doubtless the Singapore Communists had\r\n\r\ntaken  advantage  of  this visit  to  effect  secret\r\n\r\nconnections  with the P.K.I. We cannot,  of  course,\r\n\r\nexpect  them to admit this and disclose the details.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  we  should be  on  the  look-out  for\r\n\r\ninfluences from abroad on the political line of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   and  their  stooges  in   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me sum up my arguments. What I am saying\r\n\r\namounts to this. The Communists and their stooges in\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis and other Communists open front\r\n\r\norganisations have only one political  objective  in\r\n\r\nthe  recent past and at the present moment, and that\r\n\r\nis  to  avoid  security action which they  fear  and\r\n\r\nexpect  would be taken against them after merger  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  To  secure  this  objective,   they   are\r\n\r\nprepared to see the continuation of colonial rule in\r\n\r\nSingapore, provided the Internal Security Council is\r\n\r\nabolished.  To this end they sought the  counsel  of\r\n\r\nthe  U.K. Commission, who egged them on in their mad\r\n\r\nadventure. During the Anson by-election,  they  were\r\n\r\npanicked into the belief that Malaysia had all  been\r\n\r\nbuttoned up. This belief, which in the event  turned\r\n\r\nout to be a false alarm, caused them to run amok and\r\n\r\nbreak  away  from  the P.A.P. This has  resulted  in\r\n\r\ntheir fully exposed and isolated position today  and\r\n\r\nthe  very  dangers which they sought to escape  from\r\n\r\nnow  looms  larger and more immediate  than  before.\r\n\r\nTruly we can agree with Gibbon that in this instance\r\n\r\nthe  crimes  which  they have perpetuated - crimes  of\r\n\r\ntreachery and betrayal of their comrades as a result\r\n\r\nof    their   folly - will   bring   upon   themselves\r\n\r\nmisfortunes of their own making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today\r\n\r\nwe  see  that the P.A.P. Government is adopting  the\r\n\r\nsame tactics and same propaganda tactics of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A.  In 1959, before the general  elections,\r\n\r\nthe  Lim Yew Hock Government tried to boost  up  its\r\n\r\nprestige  by holding a grand exposition  at  Kallang\r\n\r\nPark.  It  was  quite obvious that the former  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  then  hoped that with all the  lights  and\r\n\r\nsplendour  of  the exposition the  people  would  be\r\n\r\nmisled into believing that everything was fine under\r\n\r\nthe  S.P.A.  Government. Today  we  see  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nputting up grand concerts on Chinese New Year Eve in\r\n\r\norder  to  celebrate the P.A.P.'s  Malaysia  scheme.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  see the same amount of light and splendour\r\n\r\nnow  as during the S.P.A. exposition. Evidently  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. hopes that by having this exposition, the so-called  Malaysia scheme, the people will be  misled.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P.  Government think that they can  mislead\r\n\r\nthe people into believing that their future will  be\r\n\r\nas bright as the decorations being put up for the so-called  Malaysia concert. It will enable the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda  to misrepresent anyone who goes  to  see\r\n\r\nthe  lights  as  showing support for their  Malaysia\r\n\r\nscheme.  Sir, the P.A.P. Government think that  they\r\n\r\ncan  mislead  the people into believing  that  their\r\n\r\nfuture  will be as bright as the decorations put  up\r\n\r\nfor  the so-called Malaysia concert. But just as the\r\n\r\nartificial lights did not save the S.P.A. Government\r\n\r\nfrom  their doom, the latest P.A.P. propaganda  will\r\n\r\nnot  save  the P.A.P. Government from being drowned.\r\n\r\nOur  people know well what the sell-out plan  means.\r\n\r\nThis sell-out plan is merger or Malaysia. The people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  know  that  their  future  under  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  so-called merger or Malaysia  will  be  as\r\n\r\ndark  as  the padang itself when the concert  lights\r\n\r\nare  switched  off.  The people see  in  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMalaysia plan as something good to look at  but  not\r\n\r\ngood to eat. Sir, this Malaysia plan turns out to be\r\n\r\nnothing  but  a piece of white paper  on  which  the\r\n\r\ndesperate P.A.P. politicians wish to sign  away  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the people in order to save  their  own\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as my Party Chairman, the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  said yesterday, we must not  fall  into\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. propaganda trap of crying high  and  low\r\n\r\nabout   the   principle  of  Malaysia.

It is regrettable that  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party and the U.P.P. have fallen into  the\r\n\r\npropaganda trap of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You are all lonely!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan:</b> They are now helping the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nto mislead the people into supporting their Malaysia\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscheme.
