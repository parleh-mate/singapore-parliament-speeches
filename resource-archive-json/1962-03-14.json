He is not there to  try  and\r\n\r\ncreate  a  constitution. He is there  to  implement\r\n\r\none.

If\r\n\r\never  there is a leakage of oil coming  up  to  the\r\n\r\nsurface  and  should there be a fire,  and  if  the\r\n\r\ncentralisation of this station is at Pasir Panjang,\r\n\r\nthen  the whole of Singapore, including industries,\r\n\r\nwill  not  have electricity. Has the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ngiven  consideration to that fact, and having given\r\n\r\nconsideration to that fact, does he not think  that\r\n\r\nit  would  be cheaper in the long run  to  have  an\r\n\r\nentirely  new  station  at  Jurong - as  other   more\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries are doing decentralising  their\r\n\r\npower stations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> With respect to the hon.\r\n\r\nLady,   that   is  an  entirely  different   factor\r\n\r\naltogether.

Now an additional argument  is\r\n\r\nput  forward,  that  perhaps,  to  site  one  power\r\n\r\nstation next to another is bad, and in any case the\r\n\r\nposition  is  further  made worse  because  an  oil\r\n\r\ncompany is nearby.

So roughly rather less than  half  the\r\n\r\ntotal  assessable income took the form of salaries\r\n\r\nand wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Has the Minister\r\n\r\nany intention of reducing or increasing the\r\n\r\npersonal allowance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Minister wish to answer\r\n\r\nthat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, I do not think I will\r\n\r\nanswer that question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VACANT GOVERNMENT QUARTERS FOR SENIOR CIVIL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SERVANTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance (i) how many Government Quarters for Senior\r\n\r\nCivil  Servants are vacant, and (ii) how long  they\r\n\r\nhave been vacant and why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> There are 482 senior officers'\r\n\r\nquarters. Of these, 171 are institutional  quarters\r\n\r\nand   311  are  what  are  sometimes  called   pool\r\n\r\nquarters. Institutional quarters are quarters under\r\n\r\nthe   control   of   departments  and   Ministries.\r\n\r\nOccupation of institutional quarters is required by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of the work performed by the officers,  for\r\n\r\nexample, hospitals, prisons and other places. There\r\n\r\nis no problem of vacant quarters here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pool quarters are quarters formerly occupied by\r\n\r\nexpatriate civil servants and a limited  number  of\r\n\r\nlocal  civil  servants.  In  1955,  the  Government\r\n\r\ndecided that local officers should be encouraged to\r\n\r\nown  houses and that no further quarters should  be\r\n\r\nallocated to local senior officers. Those who  were\r\n\r\nalready  in  occupation  of  such  quarters   would\r\n\r\ncontinue to do so while they remained in Government\r\n\r\nservice.  With  Malayanisation, a large  number  of\r\n\r\npool  quarters fell vacant and it became  necessary\r\n\r\nto lease a number of them to members of the public.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four such quarters were leased out in  1960.\r\n\r\nSome  of these quarters have been vacant for  three\r\n\r\nyears or more. At present, as a result of departure\r\n\r\nof further expatriate officers, there are 51 vacant\r\n\r\nquarters of which 16 are being reserved for experts\r\n\r\nand  overseas officers who will be arriving in  the\r\n\r\nnear future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  others  will  be let out  to  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.

There  has\r\n\r\nbeen  an increase of nuisance mosquitoes which  was\r\n\r\nworse  than  during the latter  part  of  the  year\r\n\r\nfollowing  the strike of the City Council employees\r\n\r\nand  consequent  chokage of  outlets  and  roadside\r\n\r\ndrains.  This  was aggravated by the unsatisfactory\r\n\r\narrangements  for  cleansing of  outlet  drains  to\r\n\r\nwhich  reference was made at an earlier sitting  of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no appreciable increase in the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of  flies.  About  seven  to  ten  such\r\n\r\ncomplaints  were received per month and were  dealt\r\n\r\nwith.  There has been no increase in mosquito-borne\r\n\r\ndisease  or  fly-borne  disease  according  to  our\r\n\r\nhospital  records. The Ministry  is  aware  of  the\r\n\r\ndeficiencies  in  the  previous  system   for   the\r\n\r\ncleansing   of  outlet  drains.  These  have   been\r\n\r\nimproved, the contract system has been tightened up\r\n\r\nwith  new  specifications for the  quality  of  the\r\n\r\nwork,  and the 1962 contracts stipulate the minimum\r\n\r\nnumber  of  workmen to be employed on the  job  for\r\n\r\neach  specified area daily. Where about 40 men were\r\n\r\nformerly  employed in cleansing outlet drains,  the\r\n\r\npresent  contract requires a total of 276  for  the\r\n\r\njob.  In fact, the condition of most outlet  drains\r\n\r\nin the city now has greatly improved and this state\r\n\r\nof affairs will continue to be maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of maintaining an adequate refuse\r\n\r\ndisposal  system, orders have been  placed  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  nine  months  for  14 new  vehicles  for  the\r\n\r\ntransport  of  refuse. Of these,  4  vehicles  have\r\n\r\nalready  been delivered. The Ministry has  recently\r\n\r\ndecided  to  call for tenders for  the  removal  by\r\n\r\ncontract of refuse in specified\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nareas,  in  specified  bin  centres  and  from  bin\r\n\r\ncentres  of  the  Housing and  Development  Board's\r\n\r\nestates  with  a  view to relieving the  increasing\r\n\r\npressure on the maintenance and extension  of  this\r\n\r\nservice.

The  prevention  of\r\n\r\nmosquito-breeding  and fly-breeding  will  require,\r\n\r\nbesides  positive  measures by  the  Ministry,  the\r\n\r\nactive  co-operation of hawkers,  householders  and\r\n\r\nother  members of the public.

These  members  consist  of  two\r\n\r\ncategories  of personnel. They are (a) regulars  on\r\n\r\n\"army   service\"  and  volunteers   doing   \"colour\r\n\r\ntraining\"  service on the one hand, and  (b)  those\r\n\r\nregulars  and  volunteers who have completed  their\r\n\r\nservice  of  active  service and  are  not  on  the\r\n\r\nreserve  on  the  other.  Whereas  the  Commandant,\r\n\r\nSingapore Military Forces, is the correct authority\r\n\r\nto  exercise command over all serving regulars  and\r\n\r\nvolunteers,  the authority responsible for  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  all  matters pertaining to reservists  should\r\n\r\nproperly be the Officer in Charge of Records as  in\r\n\r\nthe  British Army. In the case of the local forces,\r\n\r\nthe officers holding the appointment of Officer  in\r\n\r\nCharge  of  Records  is called the  Defence  Forces\r\n\r\nRecord Officer. This officer's duties in connection\r\n\r\nwith  reservists  include,  amongst  other  things,\r\n\r\nlooking  after  their past records of  service  and\r\n\r\nrecording  their  up-to-date  addresses;  the   re-engagement  of  a  soldier  (about  to  go  on  the\r\n\r\nreserve) for further \"army service\" if regulars, or\r\n\r\nfor   further   \"colour   training\"   service    if\r\n\r\nvolunteers;  transferring  a  reservist  from   the\r\n\r\nreserve  to  the active list; granting a  reservist\r\n\r\npermission  to leave the State up to  a  period  of\r\n\r\ntwo'  years; permitting a reservist to wear uniform\r\n\r\non  special  occasions,  etc.  The  Defence  Forces\r\n\r\nRecord  Officer  is  also  responsible  for  paying\r\n\r\npensions  to retired service personnel and  is  the\r\n\r\n\"Pensions  Authority\"  under  the  Personal  Injury\r\n\r\n(Civilians)  Scheme, 1941, for paying  pensions  to\r\n\r\nwar widows and dependants and for paying disability\r\n\r\npensions to disabled service personnel. In order to\r\n\r\nplace reservists under his control, an amendment is\r\n\r\nrequired  to section 12 of the Ordinance.  This  is\r\n\r\nwhat clause 4 seeks to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 12 of the Ordinance will\r\n\r\nentail  consequential  amendments  to  section   2,\r\n\r\nsubsection  (1)  of  section 11,  section  42,  and\r\n\r\nsubsection (1) of section 43 of the Ordinance so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  to make provision for the Defence Forces Record\r\n\r\nOfficer  to take over the duties formerly performed\r\n\r\nby  the  Commandant, Singapore Military Forces,  in\r\n\r\nconnection   with  reservists  These  consequential\r\n\r\namendments are covered by clauses 2, 6, 7 and 8  of\r\n\r\nthe   Bill.  These  amendments  will  also   entail\r\n\r\nconsequential amendments to the Singapore  Military\r\n\r\nForces   (Reserve)  Rules,  1957.  These  will   be\r\n\r\neffected later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Defence Forces Record Officer has since\r\n\r\n1st  September, 1960, been carrying out the  duties\r\n\r\nalready referred to in connection with reservists,\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary to give retrospective  effect  to\r\n\r\nthis  by  ante-dating the Bill  to  1st  September,\r\n\r\n1960. This is what clause I seeks to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 40 of the Ordinance to\r\n\r\nallow  for the change of designation of the Officer\r\n\r\nin  Charge  Records from his former designation  of\r\n\r\n\"Officer  in  Charge Forces Record\" to his  present\r\n\r\ndesignation  of  \"Defence Forces  Record  Officer\".\r\n\r\nThis amendment has already been incorporated in the\r\n\r\nSchedule  to  the Departmental Titles  (Alteration)\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and the opportunity is therefore  being\r\n\r\ntaken  in  this  amending Bill to  make  a  similar\r\n\r\namendment   to   the  Singapore   Military   Forces\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 10 of the Ordinance to\r\n\r\nallow  for the enlistment of drummer boys and  band\r\n\r\nboys between the ages of 14 and 17 years since  the\r\n\r\npresent  provisions of the Ordinance  provide  only\r\n\r\nfor  the enlistment of those who have attained  the\r\n\r\nage  of 18 years. The intention in recruiting  such\r\n\r\nboys  is  to  ensure  that the  Singapore  Military\r\n\r\nForces  Staff  Band  will have a  regular  flow  of\r\n\r\ntrained  musicians available to take the places  of\r\n\r\nthose  bandsmen who will leave the  band  when  the\r\n\r\nlatter's  seven  years'  active  service  is  over.\r\n\r\nNearly  all  the present 60 bandsmen  and  drummers\r\n\r\nwere  recruited in 1958 within six months  of  each\r\n\r\nother, which means that all of them will be due  to\r\n\r\ngo  on the reserve about the same time. It is hoped\r\n\r\nthat  at  least some of them will want to re-engage\r\n\r\nfor  a  further  period of active  service  but  we\r\n\r\ncannot be sure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   that   in   advance.  A  similar  system   for\r\n\r\nmaintaining  a steady flow of trained musicians  is\r\n\r\nadopted  in the British Army. In 1954, it was  also\r\n\r\nthe  scheme in force in the Singapore Police  Force\r\n\r\nBand.  Band boys and drummer boys of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nMilitary Forces will be .governed by special  terms\r\n\r\nof  service and be paid special rates of pay, which\r\n\r\nwill  be incorporated in consequential rules  based\r\n\r\non this Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 provides for a new section with the\r\n\r\nobject  of  establishing  a  benevolent  fund   for\r\n\r\nregular  members of the Singapore Military  Forces.\r\n\r\nBy  virtue of the rules of the Singapore Government\r\n\r\ncooperative  Thrift and Loan Society, which  limits\r\n\r\nits  membership  to  permanent  civil  servants  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  only,  regular members  of  the  forces\r\n\r\ncannot  join that Society. Nor can members  of  the\r\n\r\nforces benefit from the Ex-Servicemen's Association\r\n\r\nin  Singapore unless they have taken part in either\r\n\r\nWorld  War I or World War II. Very few, if any,  of\r\n\r\nthe  present regular members of the forces have  so\r\n\r\nserved. There is therefore no association or thrift\r\n\r\nsociety to which members of the forces can turn for\r\n\r\nfinancial assistance in a domestic crisis,  or  for\r\n\r\nother deserving purposes, unless a special fund  is\r\n\r\ncreated  for that purpose. The creation of  such  a\r\n\r\nfund  is  what  clause 9 seeks to do.

But\r\n\r\nI  would say this, Sir, he asks us in a great  deal\r\n\r\nof  technical  jargon to approve something  because\r\n\r\nthe  British  Army does it. Well, I  have  a  great\r\n\r\nregard  for  the British Army and I have  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  what it does it has good reasons for. But  to\r\n\r\nme  it  is not adequate that we should do something\r\n\r\njust  because the British Army does it.  Surely  we\r\n\r\nhave  our own problems.

Instead we have to  create  a  special\r\n\r\npost, a gentleman to be known as the Defence Forces\r\n\r\nRecord  Officer, and we would like to know  whether\r\n\r\nthis officer is being paid more for being in charge\r\n\r\nof  reservists  than himself as Officer  in  Charge\r\n\r\nForces Record, which was his previous title; and if\r\n\r\nso,  since  when has this additional  payment  been\r\n\r\nmade?

The\r\n\r\namendments  now  proposed  are  for  the  following\r\n\r\nreasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to provide for the extension of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  enable medical officers  and  nurses\r\n\r\nserving with the United Kingdom Forces in Singapore\r\n\r\nto  carry  out  intra dermal tests and inoculations\r\n\r\nrequired   under  the  Ordinance.

This objective is  achieved\r\n\r\nby    amending   the   definitions   of    \"medical\r\n\r\npractitioner\"  and  \"nurse\" in  section  2  of  the\r\n\r\nprincipal Ordinance to include in its ambit service\r\n\r\nmedical officers and nursing personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it was found that the principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance had no provision for exemption of a child\r\n\r\nfrom  inoculation.  The `principal  Ordinance  made\r\n\r\nprovision for postponement with a maximum of  three\r\n\r\nmonths  at a time. This might in practice be  found\r\n\r\nto  be inadequate especially in the case of certain\r\n\r\ndebilitating conditions of a permanent nature, such\r\n\r\nas  uncompensated heart disease, chronic nephritis,\r\n\r\nserious  allergies.  Clause  4  provides  for  such\r\n\r\nexemption to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the definition of \"medical certificate\"\r\n\r\nhas   been   extended   to   include   such   other\r\n\r\ncertificates  as  may `be accepted  by  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nDirector  of Medical Services (Health) as  evidence\r\n\r\nof  inoculation. The purpose of this  amendment  is\r\n\r\nprincipally  to  enable suitable  documents  issued\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore to be accepted as valid evidence\r\n\r\nof  previous inoculation. The definition of medica1\r\n\r\ncertificate  in  the principal  Ordinance  was  too\r\n\r\nrestricted and covered only certificates issued  by\r\n\r\nregistered medical practitioners in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, opportunity is taken to effect the\r\n\r\nconsequential    amendment   arising    from    the\r\n\r\nreorganisation of the Ministry of Health last year,\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  reference  to Assistant  Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical   Services   (Health)  in   the   principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance is changed to Deputy Director of  Medical\r\n\r\nServices  (Health)  who  will  be  the  appropriate\r\n\r\nofficer  discharging the duties required under  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Diphtheria Immunisation Regulations are ready\r\n\r\nfor  publication and will be published as  soon  as\r\n\r\nthis  amendment Bill has been enacted and  assented\r\n\r\nto.

This\r\n\r\nlegislation  was  passed  as  The  Minor   Offences\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Act, 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, in the course of negotiations over the\r\n\r\nterms   and   conditions  of  service  of   certain\r\n\r\ncategories of Government officers conducted between\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the Amalgamated Union of Public\r\n\r\nEmployees, the Union requested, among other things,\r\n\r\nthat   the  Government  should  introduce   similar\r\n\r\nlegislation in Singapore for the protection of  the\r\n\r\nState's  postmen.  This  was  considered  to  be  a\r\n\r\nreasonable request, and the Government agreed  that\r\n\r\nit would introduce a Bill accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, which is based on the Federation of\r\n\r\nMalaya Minor Offences (Amendment) Act, 1961,  seeks\r\n\r\nto  amend  the Minor Offences Ordinance  so  as  to\r\n\r\nprovide  that  any person (such as a  postman)  who\r\n\r\nenters any house or premises\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  ordinary course of his duties or with  the\r\n\r\nexpress  or implied permission of the occupier  and\r\n\r\nsuffers  any  injury  caused by  a  dog,  shall  be\r\n\r\nawarded  compensation,  not exceeding  one  hundred\r\n\r\ndollars,  to  be  assessed `by a  magistrate.

However,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I welcome this amendment to  the\r\n\r\nMinor  Offences  Ordinance.  Although  the  persons\r\n\r\nprimarily  intended  to benefit  by  this  are  the\r\n\r\npostmen,  the  Bill, I think, takes it  beyond  the\r\n\r\npostmen to any person who suffers a bite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary provision which enables a Magistrate\r\n\r\nto  assess damages to a sum not exceeding  $100  is\r\n\r\nwelcome.

But  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nexpress  my regret at certain stipulations  in  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that about ten\r\n\r\nmonths  ago, the Government intended to  pass  this\r\n\r\nBill  through its three stages at one  sitting.  At\r\n\r\nthat time, all of us in the Opposition on this side\r\n\r\nof  the  House expressed our opposition to  such  a\r\n\r\nmove because the provisions in this Bill would have\r\n\r\naffected  us  very  much as they  would  limit  our\r\n\r\nfreedom  to a great extent. Later on, we asked  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  refer the Bill to Select  Committee\r\n\r\nfor  consideration. We are glad to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  accepted  the constructive  suggestions\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Opposition  side.  Although  the  Report\r\n\r\nbefore  us shows that the Government have  accepted\r\n\r\nsome  ten amendments, there is one clause on  which\r\n\r\nwe have to express our opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 20 provides penalties\r\n\r\nfor  dishonourable conduct. If  my  memory  is  not\r\n\r\nwrong,  on 17th November, 1961, Opposition  Members\r\n\r\ncondemned the definition of the term \"dishonourable\r\n\r\nconduct\"  because the Government  did  not  give  a\r\n\r\nclear  definition of this term. As Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  we  are  rather  worried  because   our\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  expression in  this  Assembly  can  be\r\n\r\nrestricted  by  this  term \"dishonourable  conduct\"\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not  clearly  defined.  Our  freedom  of\r\n\r\nexpression  would  therefore  be  limited  by  law.\r\n\r\nAlthough the so-called dishonourable conduct of any\r\n\r\nMember is to be decided\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the Assembly as a whole, we are rather worried,\r\n\r\nfrom  experience  in the past. If  criticisms  came\r\n\r\nfrom the Opposition side, the Government would very\r\n\r\nlikely   term  such  criticisms  as  \"dishonourable\r\n\r\nconduct\".  Therefore, we are of  the  opinion  that\r\n\r\nwithout   a   clear   definition   of   the    term\r\n\r\n\"dishonourable conduct\", the freedom of  expression\r\n\r\nof  Opposition Members would be greatly restricted.\r\n\r\nThe  Report  of the Select Committee on  this  Bill\r\n\r\ndiscloses   that   the   most  important   question\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in  Select  Committee  was  the   proper\r\n\r\n`definition  of  the term \"dishonourable  conduct\".\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the fine from $5,000 to $1,000  in\r\n\r\nthe  event of an Assemblyman being found guilty  of\r\n\r\ndishonourable  conduct is not very important.  What\r\n\r\nis  more important is that there should be  a  very\r\n\r\nclear    definition   as   to   what    constitutes\r\n\r\ndishonourable conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we hope that the Government can\r\n\r\ntruly  carry  out  its  duties  in  the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. From now on, it should not\r\n\r\ntry  to make use of any loophole in the law to deal\r\n\r\nwith  Opposition Members. We sincerely  hope  that,\r\n\r\nwhen  faced  with  possible  criticisms  from   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  side, the Government  will  not  light-heartedly  resort to the provisions in  this  Bill,\r\n\r\nespecially the provisions in clause 20, to restrict\r\n\r\nthe freedom of expression in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we also hope that the Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned will assure us that the use of  the  term\r\n\r\n\"dishonourable  conduct\" will  not  be  applied  to\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members because we will exercise  self-discipline.  As representatives of the  people,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be responsible for what we say to the people.\r\n\r\nI believe that the speeches of Assemblymen are made\r\n\r\nwith  a sense of responsibility. They are made from\r\n\r\na national point of view with a sense of good will\r\n\r\nand good intention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was glad to hear what the\r\n\r\nMinister said just now, that this Bill would not be\r\n\r\napplied  to Members of the Assembly and members  of\r\n\r\nthe  public and that there would be no occasion  to\r\n\r\napply  the  provisions  of the  Bill.  If  anything\r\n\r\nshould go amiss by misusing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Bill, then I say I would  be\r\n\r\npessimistic  as  to  the  future  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  That is why I hope the Government  will\r\n\r\nnot  lightly  make use of this term  \"dishonourable\r\n\r\nconduct\" to deal with Opposition Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, it gives me great\r\n\r\npleasure  to  recall the alarm on the part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Front Benches when we suggested that the\r\n\r\nBill  should be sent to Select Committee. What they\r\n\r\nenquired  was, \"What is the Assembly to do  in  the\r\n\r\nface  of  the  wild  men on the Opposition  Benches\r\n\r\nwithout  a Privileges Ordinance in order to protect\r\n\r\nthem?\". I trust they will digest the lesson of  the\r\n\r\nvaluable cooperation in Select Committee in seeking\r\n\r\nto  bring about a provision which was acceptable to\r\n\r\nall Parties and also a recognition of the sense  of\r\n\r\nresponsibility displayed by Members on this side of\r\n\r\nthe   House  and  the  complete  absence   of   any\r\n\r\nfoundation for the hysterical alarm they  displayed\r\n\r\nduring the Second Reading. I do not know if  it  is\r\n\r\nappropriate,  but  I  would  like  to   take   this\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  expressing  appreciation  for  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Select Committee who helped a great\r\n\r\ndeal  in  bringing  about fruitful  cooperation  in\r\n\r\nrespect of a Bill which now receives the support of\r\n\r\nall Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A certain amount of anxiety has been indicated by\r\n\r\nthe  previous speaker with reference to the  phrase\r\n\r\n\"dishonourable  conduct\". As  you  are  aware,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  except in respect of mathematical  terms,\r\n\r\nit  is  almost  humanly impossible  to  define  any\r\n\r\nphrase   with   absolute   accuracy.   The   phrase\r\n\r\n\"dishonourable  conduct\" has, in  fact,  been  left\r\n\r\nundefined  by the Select Committee because  it  was\r\n\r\nconsidered best that the matter should be  left  to\r\n\r\nthe   good   sense  of  successive  Committees   of\r\n\r\nPrivileges  representing the ideas and feelings  of\r\n\r\ntheir  time  and who, in the context of  their  own\r\n\r\ndecency  and  their own integrity,  will  judge  of\r\n\r\ntheir   fellow  Members  or  of  strangers  alleged\r\n\r\ntransgressions.  It is true that  the  majority  on\r\n\r\nevery  Select  Committee  is  quite  properly   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  majority,  and  in  this  context,   in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the immediate future, it is  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmajority.

So  I would suggest to the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChoa   Chu   Kang  that  possibly  his  fears   are\r\n\r\nmisplaced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to stress here\r\n\r\nis  that  this Bill, when it becomes  law,  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing   to   be   entrusted  to  the  Minister   to\r\n\r\nadminister, but it will be entirely administered by\r\n\r\nthe   House  itself  and  not  by  the  Ministerial\r\n\r\nBenches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\npoint  out  to  the Member for Choa Chu  Kang  that\r\n\r\npublished with the record of the proceedings of the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee is a paper which you prepared  on\r\n\r\nbreaches of privilege and contempts in the House of\r\n\r\nCommons  as Paper B in Appendix IV. In this  paper,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, you have referred to one case  of\r\n\r\ndishonourable conduct which appears in May at  page\r\n\r\n116. The precedent that you cited as an instance of\r\n\r\ndishonourable  conduct  was  a  case   of   corrupt\r\n\r\nacceptance  of payment for disclosure of  a  secret\r\n\r\nmatter.  Now, if the Member for Choa  Chu  Kang  is\r\n\r\ninterested  in  going further into this  matter,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest that he look up May at that page and he can\r\n\r\nget  all  the  information that he wants,  all  the\r\n\r\nprecedents of cases of dishonourable conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE NATIONAL REFERENDUM BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's\r\n\r\nconsent  to proceed with this Bill.

This method of\r\n\r\nascertaining  the  popular will of  the  electorate\r\n\r\nintroduces   another  aspect  of   the   democratic\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are aware, Sir, this Bill stimulated\r\n\r\nconsiderable interest as evidenced by the number of\r\n\r\namendments which had been proposed, so much so that\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Reading of the Bill  was  referred  in\r\n\r\norder  to enable the Government to study them  very\r\n\r\ncarefully   in  all  its  implications.   We   have\r\n\r\nconsidered them in full and in detail, and later in\r\n\r\nmy  speech I will let the House know which  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  amendments the Government  accepts  and\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Government rejects. The Government  has\r\n\r\nalso,  after  considering some  of  the  amendments\r\n\r\nproposed, decided to put in some amendments of  its\r\n\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose, therefore, to deal with this Bill by\r\n\r\nfirst  explaining it as it stands at  present,  and\r\n\r\nthen touching in general on the amendments proposed\r\n\r\nby   the  Opposition  and  those  proposed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as it is drafted at present, the Bill can be\r\n\r\nconveniently explained in three parts, namely:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the general principles of the referendum;\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the procedure for the holding of a\r\n\r\nreferendum and the manner of voting; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) provisions of the Bill dealing with corrupt\r\n\r\nand  illegal practices in connection with  the\r\n\r\ntaking of a referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the first part, clause 5 empowers\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  by  Order,  when  he\r\n\r\nconsiders that it is in the public interest  to  do\r\n\r\nso,  to direct that any matter be submitted to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate for a referendum. When such an Order has\r\n\r\nbeen  issued,  the  Minister is  then  required  by\r\n\r\nclause  6 of the Bill to notify in the Gazette  the\r\n\r\ndate of the referendum at least seven days before\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  date  fixed for such referendum. The Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara is also empowered by  clause  7  to\r\n\r\nissue  a  further Order for a referendum if,  after\r\n\r\nthe  issue of the first Order, he is satisfied that\r\n\r\nowing  to  any  cause whatsoever no referendum  has\r\n\r\ntaken place in pursuance of such first Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of holding a referendum in\r\n\r\nSingapore, only Singapore citizens on the electoral\r\n\r\nregisters  can  vote  at the referendum,  and  they\r\n\r\nshall  be  entitled  to  vote  only  once  at  such\r\n\r\nreferendum.  Those  provisions  are  laid  down  in\r\n\r\nclauses  8  and 9 pf the Bill. Clause  11  provides\r\n\r\nthat  for  purposes of a referendum,  the  existing\r\n\r\nelectoral divisions and polling districts under the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance\r\n\r\nare to be adopted. The Superintendent appointed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  purposes  of  a  referendum  is\r\n\r\nrequired  under  the provisions  of  clause  13  to\r\n\r\npublish in the Gazette a notice not later than five\r\n\r\ndays  before the date of the referendum, specifying\r\n\r\nall the polling stations provided by him for use in\r\n\r\nthe  polling districts and electoral divisions  for\r\n\r\nthe referendum, as well as specifying the questions\r\n\r\nto  be  submitted to the electors and  the  symbols\r\n\r\nwhich he has adopted for use in connection therein.\r\n\r\nUnder clause 14, polling day has been made a public\r\n\r\nholiday   within  the  meaning  of   the   Holidays\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the procedure for the holding of a\r\n\r\nreferendum,  the procedure has been  largely  based\r\n\r\nand  modelled  on the provisions of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly Elections Ordinance, and those\r\n\r\nprocedural provisions are set out in Part II of the\r\n\r\nBill.  Bearing in mind, however, that no individual\r\n\r\ncandidates or political Parties are involved in the\r\n\r\nsame  sense as they are involved in elections, some\r\n\r\nmodifications have been made in the procedure.  The\r\n\r\nposition  of  political Parties in the Assembly  in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  a referendum is  recognised,  and\r\n\r\npolitical  Parties represented in  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  may be allowed to appoint polling  agents\r\n\r\nand  counting  agents  at  the  discretion  of  the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent under the provisions of  clauses  17\r\n\r\nand 27\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrespectively.  Under the provisions  of  clause  27\r\n\r\nalso,  when the counting of the votes cast  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  has  been completed, the Superintendent\r\n\r\nshall  declare the result of the referendum and  in\r\n\r\naccordance with clause 29 he shall forthwith, after\r\n\r\nthe  result  has been, declared by him,  compile  a\r\n\r\nstatement  of  the referendum and shall  cause  the\r\n\r\nsaid statement to be published in the Gazette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manner of voting in the referendum is exactly\r\n\r\nsimilar   to  that  at  any  election   under   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Singapore Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance. Since everyone in this  House\r\n\r\nis  familiar with the manner of voting, there is no\r\n\r\nneed  for me to proceed with explaining how  voting\r\n\r\nis  to  be  carried  out. The  same  penalties  for\r\n\r\noffences  in  respect of ballot papers  and  ballot\r\n\r\nboxes  as  in  the  Singapore Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance are provided for in clause  31\r\n\r\nof the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III of the Bill deals with corrupt and\r\n\r\nillegal  practices arising out of the taking  of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  and, in the main, adopts with  suitable\r\n\r\namendments   the   provisions  of   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly Elections Ordinance. The  same\r\n\r\npenalties  for  offences  in  respect  of   corrupt\r\n\r\npractices   and  illegal  practices,  as   in   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance,\r\n\r\nare incorporated in clauses 37 and 41 of this Bill.\r\n\r\nThe  same provisions for prohibition on polling day\r\n\r\nof  undue  influence at or near  polling  stations,\r\n\r\nunlawful    assemblies,    offence    to    operate\r\n\r\nloudspeakers,  and the restrictions  on  referendum\r\n\r\nactivity are included in clauses 43, 44, 45 and  46\r\n\r\nof   the  Bill.  Clause  46  restricts  any  person\r\n\r\nattending  a  primary or secondary  school  or  any\r\n\r\nperson,  against  whom an Order of Supervision  has\r\n\r\nbeen made under the provisions of the Criminal  Law\r\n\r\n(Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1955, from taking\r\n\r\npart in any activity connected with a referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill makes miscellaneous\r\n\r\nprovisions. Just as for elections, the holding of a\r\n\r\nreferendum involves the Government in expenditure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof public money, and based on previous knowledge of\r\n\r\nfunds  spent  in  connection with  the  holding  of\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections, it is estimated that a  sum  of\r\n\r\n$400,000  would be required for the  holding  of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the amendments as proposed by\r\n\r\nthe Opposition. The Opposition amendments could  be\r\n\r\nconveniently   divided   into   three   categories.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  those amendments which intend  ostensibly\r\n\r\nto   ensure  propriety  in  the  conduct   of   the\r\n\r\nreferendum, the Government is prepared to accept. I\r\n\r\nwould  first of all, however, like to say that  the\r\n\r\nmodifications which the Government has made in  the\r\n\r\nBill  with regard to the procedural provisions  for\r\n\r\nthe holding of a referendum vis-a-vis the Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance were made because no individual candidate\r\n\r\nor  political  Parties were involved  in  the  same\r\n\r\nsense  as  they were in the case of elections,  and\r\n\r\nalso  in  order  to simplify the procedure  at  the\r\n\r\npolling   stations   and  to   save   time.   These\r\n\r\nmodifications   were   to   suit   the    different\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  a referendum. However,  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  there can be no doubt about the propriety  of\r\n\r\nthe  conduct  of  the  referendum,  the  Government\r\n\r\naccepts the amendments of the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  (1) the appointments  of  polling\r\n\r\nagents  and  counting agents by  political  Parties\r\n\r\nrepresented in the Assembly themselves, and not  as\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill empowering the Superintendent to  use\r\n\r\nhis discretion in allowing such appointments to  be\r\n\r\nmade by political Parties; (2) in including in this\r\n\r\nBill   similar  provisions  as  in  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative   Assembly  Elections  Ordinance   with\r\n\r\nregard  to  allowing polling agents to affix  their\r\n\r\nseals  to ballot boxes and other sealed packets  if\r\n\r\nthey so desire, and for the opening of ballot boxes\r\n\r\nin  the  presence of such counting agents as attend\r\n\r\nand for the recounting of votes upon application by\r\n\r\npolitical Parties in the Assembly or their counting\r\n\r\nagents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Bill was drafted, it was intended\r\n\r\nthat  in a referendum on merger since no individual\r\n\r\ncandidates were involved, the Superintendent should\r\n\r\nuse his power of discretion allowed to him\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  propose  to political Parties having  the  same\r\n\r\nviews  on merger that they may jointly appoint  one\r\n\r\npolling  agent to each polling place and  also  one\r\n\r\ncounting  agent to each counting centre.  This  was\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of the modification of the  Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  The provisions with regard to  affixing\r\n\r\nof  seals  to  ballot boxes and sealed  packets  by\r\n\r\npolling agents was to make the procedure at polling\r\n\r\nstations  as simple as possible and to  save  time,\r\n\r\nbearing  in  mind that at no time after the  ballot\r\n\r\nboxes  and sealed packets leave the polling station\r\n\r\nuntil  they arrive at the counting centre are  they\r\n\r\nin  the  hands  of  one person,  hut  are  in  fact\r\n\r\naccompanied  by the presiding officer and  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  polling  staff, escorted by  the  police.  The\r\n\r\nprovision  of  opening  ballot  boxes  at  counting\r\n\r\ncentres  in  the  presence of counting  agents  was\r\n\r\nomitted,  because it was considered from a drafting\r\n\r\npoint  of  view  that  this was unnecessary,  since\r\n\r\nclause   27   (2)   already   provided   that   the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent  shall  make  arrangements  for  the\r\n\r\ncounting  of  the  votes in the  presence  of  such\r\n\r\ncounting  agents  as attend and these  arrangements\r\n\r\nfor  counting would include the taking out  of  the\r\n\r\nballot papers from the ballot boxes. However, as  I\r\n\r\nhave said earlier, the Government has accepted  the\r\n\r\namendment of the Member for Queenstown so  that  no\r\n\r\none  can  Question the propriety of the referendum.\r\n\r\nAgain,  the reason why the provision for a  recount\r\n\r\nof  votes on application was omitted was to make it\r\n\r\nan administrative function of the Superintendent in\r\n\r\norder  to  prevent requests for recounts on  flimsy\r\n\r\nand trivial grounds or for obstructive purposes and\r\n\r\nalthough  there  was  no express  provision  for  a\r\n\r\nrecount to be made, no Assistant Superintendent  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  a  counting  centre  would  refuse  any\r\n\r\nreasonable application for a recount if made at the\r\n\r\nappropriate time. In omitting from the  Bill  these\r\n\r\nprovisions  which the Member for Queens-town  wants\r\n\r\nincluded,  the  Government wanted to  simplify  the\r\n\r\nadministrative arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category were those Opposition\r\n\r\namendments   which,   after  careful   study,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment considers to have some sense  and  could\r\n\r\nwithin  reason  be, accepted with modifications  or\r\n\r\nimprovements.  To  give two  examples, instead  of\r\n\r\ntotal   prohibition  of  flags, banners,  symbols,\r\n\r\nadvertisements,  etc.,  and  total  prohibition  of\r\n\r\ncanvassing  either  before,  during  or  after  any\r\n\r\nreferendum,   the   Government  has   accepted   an\r\n\r\nOpposition   amendment  to  limit  prohibition   of\r\n\r\ncanvassing  only to polling day and  to  limit  the\r\n\r\nprohibition on flags, banners, symbols,  etc, only\r\n\r\nto  the  period  from  the date  of  issue  of  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Order of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  up\r\n\r\nto and including the day fixed for the taking of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum.  As  you  are  aware,  Sir,   we   have\r\n\r\nsubmitted  an amendment to this effect.  There  are\r\n\r\nother  instances  also where Opposition  amendments\r\n\r\nrequest  that longer periods of time  be  given  in\r\n\r\nrespect of certain statutory notifications and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment considers that within reason the  period\r\n\r\nof  time  could be extended further. These will  be\r\n\r\ngone into more fully at the Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category of Opposition amendments were\r\n\r\napparently  designed for and would have the  effect\r\n\r\nof  creating delay and obstruction and mischief and\r\n\r\ntrouble   at  polling  stations,  or  inviting   of\r\n\r\nintimidation  or  generally  creating   chaos   and\r\n\r\nconfusion  to  the  voters.  These  amendments  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  obviously must reject if the  views  of\r\n\r\nthe  people were to be properly ascertained without\r\n\r\nany  fear or confusion. At the Committee stage, the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  give  detailed   reasons   which\r\n\r\nOpposition  amendment  it  is  unable  to   accept.\r\n\r\nSuffice  it  for me to say at this stage  that  the\r\n\r\nreasons for non-acceptance are based on grounds  of\r\n\r\nnon-justification, causing    delay,    inviting\r\n\r\nobstruction and trouble at polling stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Sir, at the Committee stage. I shall be\r\n\r\nmoving a number of amendments of which I have given\r\n\r\nnotice  and  I will explain the reasons  for  these\r\n\r\namendments  when  they are moved in  committee.  As\r\n\r\nmentioned earlier, these amendments were made after\r\n\r\nconsidering\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  amendments  proposed  by   the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  Most  of  these  amendments   are   in\r\n\r\nconnection with provisions for referendum petitions\r\n\r\nwhere  the  Government has put  into  comprehensive\r\n\r\nform the Member for Anson's proposal for referendum\r\n\r\npetition provisions to be included in the Bill, but\r\n\r\nin  keeping with the detailed drafting of this Bill\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has spelt out the  provisions  for\r\n\r\nreferendum petitions in greater detail under a  new\r\n\r\nPart  V  of  the  Bill. In agreeing to  incorporate\r\n\r\nreferendum petition provisions, the Government will\r\n\r\nalso accept with a further amendment the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson's amendment to clause 27 with regard  to  the\r\n\r\ninclusion of Orders of a High Court Judge  relating\r\n\r\nto  the  inspection.,  copying  and  production  of\r\n\r\nballot  papers or other documents required for  the\r\n\r\npurpose of instituting or maintaining a prosecution\r\n\r\nor referendum petition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the provisions of this\r\n\r\nBill,  the  first  matter to be  submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nelectors  for  a referendum will be the  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions   of  merger  of  Singapore   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation.   Mach  has  already  been   said   and\r\n\r\nexplained about this merger during the past  months\r\n\r\nthrough  the  radio, forums, meetings,  discussions\r\n\r\nand  Press interviews.

For example, both the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  and  the Prime Minister  twisted  our\r\n\r\npreference for general elections to mean that we in\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis fear that the people may  not\r\n\r\nhave  the intelligence to know how to choose  in  a\r\n\r\nreferendum -  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is what you have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - whereas the P.A.P. believes\r\n\r\nin the wisdom and intelligence of the people in the\r\n\r\nreferendum.

The Prime Minister - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder how the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  can  relate what he is  saying  to  the\r\n\r\nBill.  The Bill deals with the proposal to  have  a\r\n\r\nNational  Referendum  Ordinance  and  the  argument\r\n\r\nseems  to be that the Member for Queenstown is  not\r\n\r\nin favour of the Bill, if he alleges that a general\r\n\r\nelection  would  be  a better way  of  doing  these\r\n\r\nthings.  I  might remind the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\nand incidentally all other Members, that we are  on\r\n\r\nthe  Second Reading of the Bill and under  standing\r\n\r\nOrder  67  (2), \"a debate may arise  covering  the\r\n\r\ngeneral   merits  and  principle  of   the   Bill.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  cannot see how the  failure  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to call a general election has anything  to\r\n\r\ndo with this Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I understand that. I merely\r\n\r\nwanted  to  point  out the illogical  argument  all\r\n\r\nalong put forward by the P.A.P. I have no intention\r\n\r\nwhatsoever of dwelling on the subject of a  general\r\n\r\nelection  or the argument for it. All I  wanted  to\r\n\r\npoint out was that when they talk of the wisdom  of\r\n\r\nthe  people they do not really mean what they  say.\r\n\r\nWhen  they  say they believe in the wisdom  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  they also say the people will be confused.\r\n\r\nTherefore they really mean otherwise. However,  now\r\n\r\nthat  a  referendum is preferred by the  P.A.P. to\r\n\r\ndecide  on  the constitutional future of Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe  in  the Barisan Sosialis, and I believe all  on\r\n\r\nthis side of the House, are fully prepared for  the\r\n\r\neventuality  of  a  referendum  carried  out  on  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic basis, on democratic lines. But first we\r\n\r\nwant   to  know  what - of  course,  it  has  to   be\r\n\r\nexplained - is the issue to be decided upon, and then\r\n\r\nwe  must also strive to ensure that all the minimum\r\n\r\ndemocratic essentials are not deliberately omitted.\r\n\r\nSir,  we  have  so  far  neither  information   nor\r\n\r\nconsultation as to how and in what form  the  vital\r\n\r\nissue   is  to  be  decided  upon  in  the   coming\r\n\r\nreferendum.

What does he mean  by  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions?  Why  cannot he be straightforward  and\r\n\r\ntell us all what this is all about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  had  enlarged on that  phrase  \"terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions\", he would have been completely  Out  of\r\n\r\norder  with  reference to this Bill. We  cannot  go\r\n\r\ninto  details  of that nature. The  Bill  does  not\r\n\r\nspecifically say that there will be a referendum in\r\n\r\nregard  to  merger.  But in  passing.  Members  can\r\n\r\nmention this Issue which will be perhaps the  first\r\n\r\nissue under this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister did say that it\r\n\r\nis  for the constitutional future of Singapore, and\r\n\r\nwe  can assume that the referendum is about the so-called White Paper of the P.A.P. Sir, these are all\r\n\r\nvital  questions  and  we are  glad  to  note  that\r\n\r\namendments have been tabled by the Member for Anson\r\n\r\non, this particular point, because we know only too\r\n\r\nwell  P.A.P. thinking on controversial  issues.  We\r\n\r\nknow  how the P.A.P. will try to do things only  to\r\n\r\nthe  advantage  of the P.A.P. and to  nobody  else.\r\n\r\nThey have done too - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> For the Barisan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - many things arbitrarily in\r\n\r\nthe  last 2\ufffd years and have twisted and turned once\r\n\r\ntoo  often. In fact, Sir, if it is a case of posing\r\n\r\nthe  questions as regards the constitutional future\r\n\r\nof  Singapore,  we would support the  amendment  of\r\n\r\nhaving  only one question, as this would  give  the\r\n\r\npeople  an  opportunity to give a  categorical  and\r\n\r\nclear-cut  answer  whether or  not  they  want  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  White  Paper merger  proposals.  That  is\r\n\r\nassuming  that we are talking of their  merger.  We\r\n\r\nare  glad  to  note that the United People's  Party\r\n\r\nalso has come out with a statement that they are in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  only one question to be  posed  to  the\r\n\r\npeople for their decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am told that in any social or economic\r\n\r\nsurvey,  there  exists  a very  close  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween the questions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput and the results that follow. The wording of the\r\n\r\nquestion can also have a very serious influence  on\r\n\r\nthe  result that follows. Often improper  questions\r\n\r\nasked -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The answer is no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and improper words used may lead to answers that may not correspond with the actual situation. I say, Sir, this is more so in the event of a referendum. Let us assume that the issue is whether the voter is for or against merger as our next constitutional advance - a simple one.\r\n\r\nThere  can  be so many ways of posing the question.\r\n\r\nIf  a  voter is asked whether he is for or  against\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. type of merger as outlined in the White\r\n\r\nPaper, he may well say no -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On the other hand, he may not say\r\n\r\nyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - even though he is not against\r\n\r\nmerger.  So  you  can  see the  difficulty  of  the\r\n\r\nframing and the wording of the question. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthink  they have this trump card up their  sleeves.\r\n\r\nBut  anyway we will have to watch and find out. But\r\n\r\nlet me add, Sir, that if the posing of the question\r\n\r\nis  going to be fair - since they talk so much  about\r\n\r\nfairness - it   must   he  clear,   unequivocal   and\r\n\r\nstraightforward so that the electorate can have the\r\n\r\nchance to answer it in a straightforward and clear-cut manner. We in the Barisan Sosialis believe that\r\n\r\nin  view of all this, the Government should  table,\r\n\r\nin  the  first  instance  in  the  Assembly,  their\r\n\r\nproposal regarding the issue, the question and  its\r\n\r\nwording  for examination, discussion and debate  by\r\n\r\nMembers.  That  is absolutely important.  Then  and\r\n\r\nthen  only will all Parties be satisfied that there\r\n\r\nis  no  juggling or underhand tricks on this  vital\r\n\r\nissue of the specification of question or questions\r\n\r\nto be submitted to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important thing, as far as we are\r\n\r\nconcerned, is that the provisions of the Bill  will\r\n\r\nprevent corruption, rigging of votes and any unfair\r\n\r\nadvantage   that  would  make  the  result   of   a\r\n\r\nreferendum    meaningless,   and   a    meaningless\r\n\r\nreferendum - a  phoney  referendum - will  give  phoney\r\n\r\nlegality to discredited politicians\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  further  discredit parliamentary  democracy  in\r\n\r\nthis  part  of the world.

Let me just finish\r\n\r\noff by telling the P.A.P. leaders this: do not help\r\n\r\nill the creation of an undemocratic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in clause 5, it is the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  who considers when a referendum  is  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out.  In  actual practice,  the  Yang  di-Pertuan means the Minister. Now, a referendum as we\r\n\r\nall  know, is a national matter affecting the lives\r\n\r\nand  future  of every voter as well as  every  non-voter  in Singapore and, indeed, all Malaya. It  is\r\n\r\nimperative,  therefore, that all other  Parties  be\r\n\r\nconsulted  and given a say in the matter.  Let  the\r\n\r\nwhole   question  be  aired  and  debated  in   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing applies in clause 7. Surely, it\r\n\r\nwould  be  more  democratic to let the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  be the final authority in this  instance.\r\n\r\nNowadays  the P.A.P. Government have the  habit  of\r\n\r\nbringing into the Assembly all sorts of motions and\r\n\r\nresolutions on matters which should rightly  belong\r\n\r\nto  the  authority of the Government. We have  seen\r\n\r\nthis  happen during the merger debate three  months\r\n\r\nback.  Yet on matters of truly national importance.\r\n\r\non a matter that may possibly occur only once in  a\r\n\r\nlifetime, when a matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  rightly  be  debated in the  Assembly,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government want to arrogate all  power  and\r\n\r\ndecisions  to  itself.  Under those  circumstances,\r\n\r\nwhere is the practice of parliamentary democracy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of symbols, Sir, it should be\r\n\r\nborne  in  mind  that  the purpose  is  to  prevent\r\n\r\nconfusion, for if symbols are to be used, then  all\r\n\r\nthe symbols must be such as not to give the idea of\r\n\r\nunequal  values  to  the  voter.  Symbols  must  be\r\n\r\nneutral.   There   are   symbols   which    signify\r\n\r\nprosperity,  and symbols which signify  strife  and\r\n\r\nhard-snip in the minds of certain people. Let  this\r\n\r\nnot be instrumental in influencing the voter in his\r\n\r\nreal choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me elaborate a little on the principles\r\n\r\nof  canvassing.  The Bill prohibits  canvassing.  A\r\n\r\nlittle while ago the Minister for Home Affairs gave\r\n\r\nme  the  impression that canvassing will  still  be\r\n\r\npermitted in many ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Only on polling day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Only on polling day? Anyway,\r\n\r\nthey  have all this in the clause on canvassing.  I\r\n\r\nthink  they are afraid that the truth will be told.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  know;  they may be  afraid  that  their\r\n\r\ndeception  might  be exposed. All the  Parties,  we\r\n\r\nfeel,  should be allowed to express their views  on\r\n\r\nthe  questions submitted for the referendum.  Truth\r\n\r\nfears  no  exposure. Anyway, it is in keeping  with\r\n\r\nthe  spirit of democracy. The Government, with  the\r\n\r\nmonopoly of the radio and Rediffusion, and the help\r\n\r\nof  what  has  now  become a very friendly  English\r\n\r\nPress,  need not be afraid of canvassing.  Whatever\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  Parties can  do,  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Party can also do. We have no  monopoly\r\n\r\non  rallies. The P.A.P. can also hold their rallies\r\n\r\nand  perhaps there are still a number of people who\r\n\r\nwill  go along to listen to them and chalk up  more\r\n\r\nof their broken promises. We stress very much. Sir,\r\n\r\nthat there must he freedom of speech and canvassing\r\n\r\nin  connection  with  such  an  important  national\r\n\r\nissue.  The  question  of merger  affects  all  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. And\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  the  people of Singapore should be allowed  to\r\n\r\nhear  the  views of all the Parties. Then and  then\r\n\r\nonly  can  it be said that the electors  have  been\r\n\r\ngiven a fair chance to decide for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government say that this Bill has been based\r\n\r\nand  modelled  on the provisions of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly Elections Ordinance.  But  we\r\n\r\nfind  that  many important aspects of the Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance   have  been  omitted,  deliberately   or\r\n\r\notherwise,   in   the  present   Referendum   Bill.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  if the assurance given by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs that canvassing will be  allowed\r\n\r\nexcepting on polling day, then we say it is a  good\r\n\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.

Will canvassing be  allowed\r\n\r\nduring  the  so-called period of  referendum?  What\r\n\r\ndoes it mean?

Sir,I have said in my speech earlier that\r\n\r\ncanvassing is allowed except on polling  day,  just\r\n\r\nas in the general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am very glad to have that\r\n\r\nassurance.  Then  I need not elaborate  on  certain\r\n\r\npoints  in  order to impress on the P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nthe  importance of a campaign to present the  views\r\n\r\nproperly and in all perspective to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another principle we wish to emphasise, Sir, is\r\n\r\nthat  all  political  Parties  represented  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly must he allowed to provide polling  agents\r\n\r\nand counting agents. I am glad also that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment has accepted our amendment, but I  might\r\n\r\npoint out that at the present moment the Bill  only\r\n\r\nprovides  that  the  Superintendent  may   at   his\r\n\r\ndiscretion allow. We feel that we cannot allow  the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent  such  discretionary  powers  in   a\r\n\r\nreferendum that concerns all Parties. We feel  that\r\n\r\nthere  must  be no discrimination and  all  Parties\r\n\r\nmust be allowed to check and see that everything is\r\n\r\ncarried out smoothly and satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, in the spirit of the Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  we  feel strict precautions  should  be\r\n\r\ntaken to prevent possible malpractice in the voting\r\n\r\nin the referendum. I see also that the Minister has\r\n\r\nagreed  to  certain provisions,  but  I  am  in  no\r\n\r\nposition  to  know right now, Sir,  what  the  full\r\n\r\nimplications are. They have to be studied. I  think\r\n\r\nprecautions are necessary. Now that the  Government\r\n\r\nhave   given  the  undertaking  that  a  referendum\r\n\r\npetition will `be provided for, I will not touch on\r\n\r\nthat  particular  point. But the Government's  last\r\n\r\nminute amendments leave very much to be desired. We\r\n\r\nhope  the P.A.P. Government will heed our criticism\r\n\r\nof the Bill. We understand the anxiety of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and his colleagues to rush things through.\r\n\r\nBut  more  important for the good name of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  for the success of parliamentary democracy  in\r\n\r\nthis  part of the world, let there be no suspicion,\r\n\r\nnot  even a whisper of dishonesty or foul play. The\r\n\r\namendments  that have been moved in  the  Bill  are\r\n\r\nonly  for  the  purpose  of ensuring  that  when  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  is  held,  it  will  be  as  clean  and\r\n\r\npraiseworthy  as  the  elections  we  have  had  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  amendments  are  to  ensure   that\r\n\r\nSingapore's politicians when in power will  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed to imitate the election techniques  of  Ngo\r\n\r\nDinh Diem and Syngman Rhee. Let it not be said that\r\n\r\nthere  is referendum rigging in Singapore. Let  the\r\n\r\nreferendum be so conducted that it can be  seen  to\r\n\r\nbe  truly  fair, honest and completely above-board.\r\n\r\nLet  there also be no cause for dissatisfaction  or\r\n\r\ncomplaint.  Once there is distrust  in  the  proper\r\n\r\nrunning  of  any part of the State machinery,  then\r\n\r\nthe rot sets in. Despite what the Minister\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Home Affairs has said, we hope the P.A.P. will\r\n\r\nstill  consider and accept our amendments, and  the\r\n\r\namendments  of  other Opposition  Members,  in  the\r\n\r\nproper spirit of service in the cause of the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add, Sir, that the Government might even\r\n\r\ngive us a categorical assurance that the referendum\r\n\r\nwill  be binding on the Government. I will not  say\r\n\r\nmore  on  this subject, Sir, as there is already  a\r\n\r\nmotion  which  will  deal  specifically  with   the\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me say how unreasonable the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have been in the manner in  which  they\r\n\r\nhave  notified Members of the Opposition about  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's amendments. The Government may try  to\r\n\r\njustify   their  action  on  the  basis  that   the\r\n\r\namendments  have  been sent in within  the  legally\r\n\r\nallowable time period. The National Referendum Bill\r\n\r\nis  important, because on it will be based the  law\r\n\r\nwhich  will decide the future of all the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But their amendments to the  Bill  have\r\n\r\nbeen  sent  in at the last moment only just  before\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  comes  up for Second Reading.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have long ago prepared  the  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill.  The  explanation of the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  given a little while ago does not  deceive\r\n\r\nanybody.  The Second Reading was supposed  to  have\r\n\r\ntaken  place two months ago. Now `many months after\r\n\r\nthe preparation of the Bill, amendments are sent in\r\n\r\nat  the  last minute. What is the real  reason  for\r\n\r\nthis  sudden  pouncing on the Opposition  with  all\r\n\r\nthese amendments? Is it a deliberate attempt on the\r\n\r\npart  of the Government to prevent sufficient  time\r\n\r\nfor   proper  study  of  the  amendments   by   the\r\n\r\nOpposition?   Or  is  it  the  intention   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to steamroller through this  Bill  with\r\n\r\nthe  amendments?  Why  is it  that  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers   have  hardly  24  hours  to   study   the\r\n\r\nGovernment amendments to a Government Bill that had\r\n\r\nits  First  Reading four months ago? Is this  not,\r\n\r\nSir,  a  travesty  of the spirit  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some really terrible amendments\r\n\r\nproposed by the Government. They are some  of  the\r\n\r\nmost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nundemocratic  proposals that we have ever  seen  in\r\n\r\nthe whole of Singapore. But we shall deal with them\r\n\r\nwhen  we come to the Committee stage, Sir.  All  in\r\n\r\nall,  this is a most unhealthy state of affairs.  I\r\n\r\nhe  indecent manner in which the Government try  to\r\n\r\nkeep Opposition Members in the dark about important\r\n\r\nnational  matters  until the very  last  minute  is\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the normal practice of  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  I  may say, Sir, that it is  a  perfect\r\n\r\nexample of parliamentary dictatorship in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> P.A.P. democracy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,I\r\n\r\nrise  to support the principle of the Bill. I  have\r\n\r\nlistened with glee to the not so lengthy speech  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown when he tried to explain\r\n\r\nthat  a  national  referendum  is  not  a  national\r\n\r\nreferendum. But I can understand, Sir, why he is so\r\n\r\nbitter against his ox-comrades in the P.A.P. I  can\r\n\r\nalso  feel with him when he described the  remnants\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. as being people capable  of  doing\r\n\r\ntwists and turns, and doing all sorts of things  in\r\n\r\na manner that has a basis of party politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very glad to hear from the Minister in\r\n\r\nhis  speech  just  now  that  the  prohibition   of\r\n\r\ncanvassing  in  clause  42  will  be  amended.   He\r\n\r\nreferred to the amendment sent in by the Government\r\n\r\nto  apply  only on polling day. Sir, I  read  these\r\n\r\namendments  yesterday, and since the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nmade his speech, I have read it again. I would like\r\n\r\nto  point  out  to  him, Sir,  that  the  amendment\r\n\r\nproposed by him does not carry out what he  intends\r\n\r\nto  do.  The prohibition on canvassing is  still  a\r\n\r\ntotal  prohibition, hut in so far as  a  man  going\r\n\r\ninto a house more than once is concerned, he can go\r\n\r\nin more than once so long as it is not polling day.\r\n\r\nBut  if it is polling day, then that is canvassing.\r\n\r\nI  would ask the Minister to consult his colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Health and Law, on  whether  the\r\n\r\namendment put in by him bears out his statement  of\r\n\r\nprohibiting canvassing only on polling day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reference has been made in the Bill, to\r\n\r\nreferendum meetings. It first appears in clause  34\r\n\r\nand   it   comes   in  again  in  clause   45.   No\r\n\r\ninterpretation   has  been  given   of   referendum\r\n\r\nmeetings to be held by political Parties. Moreover,\r\n\r\nclause 42 - prohibition on canvassing - even with  the\r\n\r\namendments  proposed  by  the  Minister  for   Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,  will  prohibit the holding of  referendum\r\n\r\nmeetings, because a referendum meeting, after  all,\r\n\r\nis a sort of mass canvassing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point, Sir,In regard to the\r\n\r\nappointing  of polling agents and counting  agents,\r\n\r\nthis  right is being confined to political  Parties\r\n\r\nrepresented in the Legislative Assembly. Is it  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Government that in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nreferendum  meetings, after suitable amendments  to\r\n\r\nclause  42,  that  the  right  to  hold  referendum\r\n\r\nmeetings  should  also  be  confined  to  political\r\n\r\nParties in the Legislative Assembly? If it  is  so,\r\n\r\nit should be made clear in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown is very fond of\r\n\r\nchallenging  the P.A.P. to a general election,  but\r\n\r\nhe   has   supported  this  Bill  subject  to   the\r\n\r\namendments which he has put in. Surely,  Sir,  with\r\n\r\nthe  National  Referendum Bill, a general  election\r\n\r\ncould  be avoided. I think one of the first  things\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. could and should put  forward  to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate to decide is whether or not the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nwhen  they came in with 43 Members, and now reduced\r\n\r\nto 26, still have the confidence of the electorate.\r\n\r\nDo the electorate want them to remain in cilice for\r\n\r\nthe  next  two  years? That is a simple  thing.  A\r\n\r\nreferendum  on  that  matter  would,  I  am   sure,\r\n\r\ndisclose that to us. There is no need for a genera1\r\n\r\nelection.  The  referendum  will  disclose  to   us\r\n\r\nwhether  or not the P.A.P. is as good as  it  makes\r\n\r\nitself out to be. And if the P.A.P. is knocked  out\r\n\r\nin  a referendum of that kind, there is no need for\r\n\r\na  merger referendum. The answer is the same. If it\r\n\r\nis  knocked out, then the answer is there. Go ahead\r\n\r\nwith  your merger proposals. I would ask the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  to get away from  that  particular\r\n\r\nhobby  of  his  that every time  there  must  be  a\r\n\r\ngeneral election. General elections would mean\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis coming out too, and I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  all the 13 Barisan Sosialis Members  sitting\r\n\r\nbehind  me will be returned. I doubt it very  much.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the P.A.P. after having bluffed  the\r\n\r\nelectorate  in returning them with 43 Members,  now\r\n\r\nreduced  to  a shambles of 26, should  continue  in\r\n\r\noffice for the next two years would be a very  good\r\n\r\nquestion to pose in a national referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many amendments proposed by\r\n\r\nMembers   of  the  Opposition  and  also   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.

It is right  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  symbols.

Sir, in\r\n\r\nmost democratic countries vital issues such as  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional future of the State are decided in a\r\n\r\nreferendum.  In  this country, the Government  will\r\n\r\nsumbit such an issue to the people for a vote based\r\n\r\non that practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the exchange of letters between political\r\n\r\nParties  of  this Assembly and the  Leader  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse, we demanded on the 18th of September,  1961,\r\n\r\nthat   the  Government  should  submit  its  merger\r\n\r\nproposals to the people for a vote in a referendum.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  we have  today  this  National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, matters have gone very fast\r\n\r\nsince  then,  and even though the Government  might\r\n\r\nhave  second  thoughts  about  the  result  of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum, it is very difficult for them  to  pull\r\n\r\nout  from  their position, and we believe they  are\r\n\r\nfully  committed to a referendum. What is important\r\n\r\nnow is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  whether a referendum will or will not be held,\r\n\r\nbut  the  most vital issue now posed to the  people\r\n\r\nis,  what will be the question posed to them for  a\r\n\r\ndecision?  Mr  Speaker, Sir,  it  is  no  use  our\r\n\r\ndebating in this House whether time will be allowed\r\n\r\nfor   canvassing,   or  whether   there   will   be\r\n\r\nelectioneering  facilities  allowed  to  political\r\n\r\nParties in this Assembly during the referendum,  if\r\n\r\nthe  people  are asked to choose in the referendum,\r\n\r\nfor  instance, between the devil and the deep  blue\r\n\r\nsea; or between a tiger and, alternatively, to jump\r\n\r\ninto  a  deep  ravine; or either to choose  eating,\r\n\r\nlike  during the Japanese occupation, ubi  kayu  or\r\n\r\nsago   powder.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we  feel  that\r\n\r\nprovisions should be added to the Bill whereby  the\r\n\r\npolitical Parties in, this Assembly should come  to\r\n\r\nan agreement on the question to be posed before the\r\n\r\npeople.   If  the  people,  for  instance,   in   a\r\n\r\nreferendum  on  merger are asked to choose  whether\r\n\r\nthey  prefer the P.A.P. type of merger as contained\r\n\r\nin  the  White  Paper, or whether they  prefer  the\r\n\r\nMalacca and Penang type of merger whereby all  non-Singapore  born citizens would be deprived  of  all\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  including Singapore citizenship,  and\r\n\r\nthus  becoming stateless; if the people in  such  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  are asked to choose between  these  two\r\n\r\nalternatives,  then  what  is  the   use   of   our\r\n\r\ncanvassing  or asking time to canvass,  because  we\r\n\r\nwould then canvass for the people to choose whether\r\n\r\nthey  like the devil or whether they like  to  jump\r\n\r\ninto  the  deep blue sea? Therefore,  Mr  Speaker.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is our contention that the most  pressing\r\n\r\nissue  is  to request the Government that  an  All-Party meeting be called to discuss the question  to\r\n\r\nbe posed to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all other technicalities of the\r\n\r\nelectioneering campaign or the referendum  campaign\r\n\r\nare  of  less  importance. These can  be  discussed\r\n\r\namong the Parties after this vital issue of what is\r\n\r\nthe  question and what are the alternatives  to  be\r\n\r\nposed before the people has been settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The P.A.P. has  the  most\r\n\r\nunhappy  propensity  of  successfully  transmutting\r\n\r\ngold into mud. Sir, the concept of a referendum  is\r\n\r\npure gold. It is a concept of direct democracy, and\r\n\r\ndirect  democracy is of course, the  ultimate  just\r\n\r\nmethod   of  government.  It  is  in  large   areas\r\n\r\ncumbersome  in  practice and  impractical  for  the\r\n\r\nnormal work of government, and, unfortunately,  far\r\n\r\ntoo   little  used  in  the  British  Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it has been indicated by the previous\r\n\r\nspeaker  that it has an honourable history both  in\r\n\r\nSwitzerland and in Australia, and we have  recently\r\n\r\nseen  it working in France. The power of referendum\r\n\r\nto  the people is a sign of political maturity.  If\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. had it worked as one would have like  it\r\n\r\nto  work  in  this  matter, it  could  have  earned\r\n\r\nlegitimate credit for a valuable measure.

This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant issue and the Government's acceptance  of\r\n\r\nthe  principle of equal pay for equal work  is  one\r\n\r\nwhich we welcome and support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We accuse the Government,\r\n\r\nhowever,  of insincerity, of playing party politics\r\n\r\nand  of  using this apparent acceptance as a  vote-catching  device.

Unfortunately for the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthis  political stunt resulted in the disgrace  and\r\n\r\nexposure   of  the  A.U.P.E., because   what   the\r\n\r\nA.U.P.E.,  through the Parliamentary  Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Culture, was prepared  to  accept\r\n\r\nwas  thrown  out  by  the  gathering  momentum   of\r\n\r\nresentment  of  the large number of civil  servants\r\n\r\nwho  belong to other trade unions which  look  upon\r\n\r\nthe  A.U.P.E. as the biggest yellow union.  Why  is\r\n\r\nthe Women Affairs Bureau of the P.A.P, used in this\r\n\r\nparticular instance?

I\r\n\r\nremember  in  the  heydays  when  the  P.A.P. was\r\n\r\npopular,  the  present Minister  for  Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nhimself  led  a  delegation to see the  then  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister about Women's Day.

And in their helping the women\r\n\r\nin  the  civil service at the present moment,  they\r\n\r\nare  only  helping a small section of the women  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The really deserving cases, the poor who\r\n\r\nreally need all the help from the P.A.P., have  yet\r\n\r\nto  get any support and help from the P.A.P.

The Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nwas  foolish enough to say that we had made no such\r\n\r\ncalculations. In fact, we did. If it might interest\r\n\r\nhim,  the cost of this exercise for the next  three\r\n\r\nyears,  after which the female salary scales  would\r\n\r\nbe  abolished - it  has  been  worked  out  in  close\r\n\r\ndetail - amounts to this. This year we will spend  an\r\n\r\nadditional  $395,000. Next year we  will  spend  an\r\n\r\nadditional  $92,000, and the year  after  $404,000.\r\n\r\nAfter that, further additional increments the  full\r\n\r\neffect  of which will span the whole salary  scales\r\n\r\nin  the occupations affected. So it is quite untrue\r\n\r\nto  say that this decision came about by way  of  a\r\n\r\nsudden  impulse. We clearly stated in our  election\r\n\r\ncampaign that the Party, if elected to power, would\r\n\r\ncarry  out the policy of equal pay for equal  work.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  if I may be permitted to quote the  actual\r\n\r\ntext of the speech made by Madam Chan Choy Siong on\r\n\r\n8th  March, 1959, when she spoke on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nParty at a pre-election rally at Bukit Panjang:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`There is no place in a socialist society for\r\n\r\nexploitation  of  women. The PAP, believes  in  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of equal pay for equal work. This may not\r\n\r\nbe  possible immediately. It must he achieved  step\r\n\r\nby step without dislocating our economy.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And the present policy that we are now implementing\r\n\r\nis  just  the fulfilment of a pledge that  we  made\r\n\r\nbefore the electorate in March 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, although we announced this policy\r\n\r\nof  equal  pay  for  equal  work  in  reply  to   a\r\n\r\nmemorandum received from the P.A.P. Women's League,\r\n\r\nwe do not intend to disregard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   efforts   and  campaigns  of  other   women's\r\n\r\norganisations.

But I am sure  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Mountbatten, for instance, could hardly\r\n\r\nexpect  us  to  announce this new  policy  to  such\r\n\r\nassociations as have never made representations  to\r\n\r\nus on this point at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, one surprising thing about this issue is\r\n\r\nthat, strange to behold, the Barisan Sosialis,  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party and the U.P.P. have joined together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.
