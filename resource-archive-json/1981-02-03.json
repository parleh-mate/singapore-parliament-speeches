Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, on behalf of all Members of this House, extend to you our congratulations on your re-election as Speaker. This is the fourth time that you have been elected to this high office and your twelfth year in the Chair. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, Sir, have served longer than any of your predecessors, all of whom had the advantage of training in the law. Many of the functions and a great deal of the ritual associated with your office have a judicial flavour. But you have shown that the lack of legal training has been of no disadvantage and that impartiality, even if it has to be judicial, is not a monopoly of the legal profession. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In paying tribute to you, Sir, I must not forget your staff. The Clerk, Mr Lopez, has done yeoman's service ever since 1954. He is our last word on the Standing Orders. Your Translators are good. They have to be good in order to translate some of the speeches in this House simultaneously. Your Reporters are accurate. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Fifth Parliament begins today. A voice louder and stronger than mine has warned that the years, if not months, ahead may be grim. Should dark clouds gather in our sky, I would prefer to look for a silver lining. We have survived more than one crisis before and after we gained independence. During our trials and tribulations the Singaporean has proved to be resolute, resilient and resourceful. It will take more than an earthquake to bring this town to rack and ruin. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seek your indulgence if I appear to be too confident. But like many other Honourable Members in this House, I do not relish the thought of spending my old age on my bended knees. Hence our relentless but not desperate search for fresh talent. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is on that note that I have now great pleasure in welcoming our 18 new Members to this enlarged Chamber of 75. Allow me, \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Sir, to remind them that the country and the Party are looking forward to their contributions within and will be closely watching, if not monitoring, their performances outside this House. A bit of advice from an old hand should not hurt. No Member will stray from the straight and narrow path if he always lets his conscience be his guide. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Sir. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I thank the Minister for Law and Science and Technology for his very kind words about me. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am most grateful to the House for the great honour it has bestowed on me by relecting me to the Chair and I hope that I shall prove worthy of the confidence it has in me. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was first called to the Chair a little over eleven years ago, I was overcome with awe, being deeply conscious then, as I still am now, of the responsibilities of this High Office. Happily, through the years, my task in the Chair was made easier by the warm friendship, understanding and tolerance of honourable Members and I am most grateful to the honourable Members who were in the House during those years for their cooperation. I am sure that I shall continue to receive the support of honourable Members and together we will maintain the high tradiions of this House. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, I was conscious of the enthusiasm of honourable Members to participate in debates in the House and I assure them that Members who wish to speak will not fail to catch my eye. Honourable Members will, however, appreciate that precise and relevant speeches, with touches of humour, make for effective and stimulating debates, and I took forward to presiding over many such debates. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to welcome the honourable Members who have just joined us. They would be aware that the proceedings of this House are governed by the Standing Orders so that a knowledge of the Standing Orders, no matter how superficial, would help towards a better understanding of the procedure of this House. The Clerk and his Assistants are always available for advice. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I thank the House for the high honour it has bestowed on me and for the trust it has placed in me. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 10</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>SITTING OF PARLIAMENT</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>(Exemption from Standing Orders)</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n  <b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under Standing Order No. 4, I beg to move, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the proceedings at this day's sitting be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 and that this sitting be suspended until 8.30 p.m.\" \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Standing Order No. 1 provides that every sitting of this House shall begin at 2.30 p.m. and end at 8.00 p.m., \"the moment of interruption.\" His Excellency the President will be making his Address in this House at 8.30 p.m. Hence the necessity for my motion which is made under Standing Order No. 4. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the proceedings at this day's sitting be exempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 and that this sitting be suspended until 8.30 p.m.\" - [Mr E.W.

First, we need to build a modern industrial society \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 11</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> founded on sophisticated economic activities and a new relationship between management and labour. Second, we must get every citizen to recognise and support the pivotal role that defence and national service plays in underpinning our continued independence and prosperity. Third, we must complete the most crucial phase in the process of self-renewal, getting my younger Ministers to take the big decisions which my older Ministers have hitherto shouldered. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seldom have events and circumstances been more unfavourable for our economic development. Economists no longer argue whether there will be a recession in 1981. Their attention is focused on guessing how deep the recession is going to be. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be prepared for slower growth and even some unemployment in the coming years. Poor economic growth will subject management-labour relationships to severe strains. Under these more difficult circumstances, management and labour will have to evolve a new relationship, one where both management and labour pull, and are seen to be pulling, together. They must never work against each other. Old habits of confrontation between management and labour must cease. Instead, there must be identity of interest among employers, management and labour so that workers as well as employers are left in no doubt that industrial disruption brings only losses for all. We must strive to cut out waste and inefficiency. Our workers must be trained, and retrained, to higher levels of skills and professionalism to prepare them for the jobs that will see us through the 1980s. To survive, we have to upgrade our economic activities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1965, we have devoted a large part of our national resources towards building up our Armed Forces. And for good reason. They are our guarantee that Singapore will be left in peace to pursue her own ends for the good of her people. Unfortunately, we have yet to get across the message that the defence of Singapore is the responsibility of every citizen. Many people still think that, in war, the fighting will be done by the regulars and full-time national servicemen in the Singapore Armed Forces. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 12</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot afford a large standing army. The strength of our Armed Forces is, therefore, in our reserves. We must totally restructure our scheme of rewards and incentives. When service in the Armed Forces is accorded the respect and prestige that it deserves, then the Singapore Armed Forces will attract and retain talent in the regular service, and training and rank in the reserve service will be taken seriously. Everyone will soon realise that a citizen's rank and status as a Singapore Armed Forces reservist will affect his civilian career. We shall create a direct nexus between the advancement of a citizen as a soldier and his advancement as a civilian, and vice-versa. Our citizens must not regard the defence of Singapore as a two- or three-year affair, after which the national serviceman can put aside his uniform and leave it to others to carry on. No one will defend Singapore except Singaporeans. No one will fight for us except ourselves. This is the stark truth. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year marks a turning point in our process of self-renewal. The younger Ministers are taking a leading role in the political leadership and in Government. Their participation in Government decisions will become more dominant. They will evolve their own political style to keep in step with a rapidly changing electorate and the social and economic transformation that has taken place in Singapore over the last 21 years. The conduct of Government business has become more complex because our economy and our society have developed in range and in sophistication. My young Ministers bring fresh minds, bursting with enthusiasm and energy, to bear upon the problems of government. They have been trained in the new disciplines, and come up with more ambitious approaches to problem solving. My older Ministers provide that safety net of long experience and proven judgement over which the young Ministers can test out their new ideas and enthusiasm. Eventually, and not before too long, they also must acquire that touch and judgement. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to identify and induct talent into the political leadership. There is no better way to secure our future than by \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 13</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> making sure that Singapore is served at the highest levels by her best and her brightest. We shall systematically seek out young men and women of integrity and ability who are perceptive and sensitive to the needs of the people and have the dedication and drive to work for the community. They must be men of tenacity and resolve. These are the indispensable qualities of leadership which have mobilised Singaporeans into overcoming seemingly insurmountable problems in the past. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have once more shown their confidence in my Government by returning the People's Action Party in all 75 constituencies. This makes it all the more necessary to ensure that the Government does not abuse the trust built up over the last 21 years. Members of this Parliament, especially those who are not constrained by ministerial office, have a duty to voice the view of their constituents, in committees, in questions and in debates. All Bills, all legislation should be subject to the strictest scrutiny. Nothing should be passed without thorough, critical, and open debate. Parliament must mirror the views, the hopes, the doubts and the fears of Singaporeans. The more thoroughly Government policies are understood, the better the chances of successful implementation. Acceptance by and co-operation with a knowledgeable people of the policies of Government, is the way to success. This is the objective of my Government. Members will best help in achieving this objective by speaking out their views, and criticising Government policies to make them more responsive to the needs of the people. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are maturing as a nation with our own lifestyles and our own aspira- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 14</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> tions. We can learn from the West and Japan. We want their technology and knowledge, but our basic values, the essentials of our.philosophy of life, must be preserved. We cannot imitate the lifestyles or the ephemeral fancies of other peoples without doing damage to ourselves. However, we can benefit by importing from America, Europe and Japan the latest advances in medical science, computer software, the manufacturing processes for high-technology products to upgrade our economy. We can learn from Japan how to organise our society so that we become a more cohesive and a more united nation, with each Singaporean keenly aware of his responsibility to his family, to his fellow-workers, to his employer and to his country. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has grown from a fishing village into a modern metropolis because Singaporeans believe in hard work, thrift, honesty and self-reliance. So long as we continue to practise these virtues, the future holds no fear for us. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the President's Address, Mr Speaker, preceded by the Serjeant at Arms, the Clerk, the Principal Assistant Clerk and the First Assistant Clerk, escorted the President (accompanied by two A.D.Cs) out of the Chamber, and the House adjourned without question put, pursuant to the Standing Order. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    Adjourned accordingly at \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    Thirteen minutes to Nine \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    o'clock p.m. \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>ADDENDA TO PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT THE OPENING OF</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>THE FIRST SESSION OF THE FIFTH PARLIAMENT ON</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <h4>TUESDAY, 3RD FEBRUARY, 1981</h4> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Streaming</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This review of the Ministry of Education covers the period beginning February 1979 when the new education system was introduced. Last year, streaming commenced in primary schools and this year, in secondary schools. The exercise aroused widespread public controversy, as is inevitable when a major change takes place affecting many parents and their children. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of streaming pupils according to ability is to enable them to be taught at the most suitable pace. Previously, the pace of learning was set by the top 12% who made it to 'A' level in 12 years. Less able children fell by the wayside and many left school virtually illiterate. While it is easy to enunciate the objectives of streaming, it is less easy to set. up a system of implementation that will appear fair to everyone. Hence the policy of the Ministry has been to introduce streaming with caution and flexibility. Parents will accept the new policy more readily if large changes are avoided and if the reasons for the policy are clearly explained. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Secondary 1 streaming this year, streaming proportions were based on the percentage of Secondary 1 pupils who would later get three 'O' level passes. Past records showed that 50% of the Secondary 1 pupils were successful. This figure was hence used to separate those who would take the 'O' level examination in four years (in the Express and Special Streams) from those who would take five years (in the Normal Stream). Parents of 3,635 children in the 40% to 49% group were given the choice of the Express or Normal Streams. 88% chose the Express stream. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a more stringent criterion had been used, say, five 'O' level passes, only a third would have gone to the faster streams, instead of 59%. But there could well have \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> been a public uproar. However, the purpose of streaming would have been better served and more of the lower two-thirds would have been able to get five good 'O' level passes, This would have enabled them to proceed to the Polytechnic or Ngee Ann or to the 'A' level and eventually to the University. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Curriculum Development</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of curriculum development comprises two main components: syllabus definition and development of materials. The Division looking after curriculum development should be the main source of innovation. The former Education Development Division in the Ministry was not suitably organised for this purpose. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June 1980, the Division was disbanded. The job of syllabus definition was transferred to the School Inspectorate. The production of teaching materials of all kinds was taken over by a new institute, the Curriculum Development Institute of Singapore (CDIS). The former Singapore Education Media Service (SEMS), which produced educational television (ETV) programmes and audio-visual aids, was incorporated as the Division of Educational Technology in CDIS. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDIS tries to attract talented, innovative and creative teachers. The Institute is sited in the Kent Ridge campus of the National University to keep it out of reach of Ministry bureaucrats. Bureaucratic procedures are reduced to the minimum. Each team of writers is led by a Project Director who is given full responsibility for his or her project. Members of CDIS who write textbooks and produce other teaching materials will receive a share of the royalties on sales. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute is concentrating on the English and Chinese Languages, Mathematics and Science, mainly for the primary level. An example is the CLIPS project which produces Chinese Language Instructional Materials for Primary Schools. This year, CLIPS materials are used in Primary 1 \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> classes in 300 schools. Experts in English, Mathematics and Science from Britain and elsewhere are being engaged as consultants to the project teams. CDIS is also developing supplementary materials. Examples of these are materials for supplementary English and Chinese lessons for the Special Assistance Plan Schools and materials to correct common Singapore errors in written English. Materials for the monolingual courses and for the lower secondary science classes are also being developed. Altogether, there are 17 project teams at the moment. Teams will be formed for new projects when talented teachers have been identified. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDIS also conducts courses for teachers on how to use the materials it has developed. It acts as a resource centre to serve the instructional needs of teachers in schools. Its resource library containing audio-visual materials will be expanded to about five times its present size. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Moral Education</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1979, the Ong Teng Cheong Report reviewed the status of moral education in schools and made many recommendations for improvement. The report forms the basis of a new approach. However, little progress has been made. Implementation has proved more difficult and complex than expected. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Education for Living\", comprising moral education and social studies, will be replaced by Moral Education as a separate subject in primary schools. A series of books entitled \"Good Citizen\" is being produced to inculcate in our pupils desirable moral values. Pupils will be made aware of their existence, their relationship to others, their family and ultimately the nation and the world. The values imparted at each stage will be directly related to the pupils' development and experience. Instead of the traditional didactic approach, pupils will acquire the values through discussions, story-telling and other activities. Social Studies will be introduced as an additional subject only from Primary 4. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the lower secondary levels, Moral Education will replace Civics. An experimental Moral Education Programme \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> developed by Dr R. Balhatchet is being tried out in Bukit Merah Secondary School and will be extended to more schools if found successful. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religious Education, in the form of the study of an individual religion or the comparative study of religions, is being encouraged as an 'O' level examination subject. Papers on Christianity and Islam are already available for the Cambridge General Certificate of Education 'O' Level Examination. Comparative religion will be introduced shortly by the Cambridge Examination Syndicate and the Ministry is assessing its suitability. The Ministry is also considering Hinduism and Buddhism as other options. The syllabi for these two papers have been prepared and textbooks are being prepared. However, it will take several years to produce good textbooks and teaching materials and to train teachers in their effective use. Quick results cannot be expected in this area. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Computer Training of School Pupils</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop a computer software industry successfully in Singapore, a projected shortfall of up to 7,800 trained computer personnel has to be met by 1990. The Ministry has started a programme of computer training for school pupils. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980, Computer Science, as an 'A' level subject, was introduced to the first batch of 50 pupils. The second batch in 1981 will have at least 400 pupils. Each junior college teaching the subject will be equipped with a mini-computer system and will have at least two teachers trained in Computer Science. Each year, 25 teachers will undergo a diploma course in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A computer appreciation course will be conducted for pupils in 17 secondary schools from January 1981. The course will arouse pupils' interest in computers and teach them to write simple computer programmes. Another 30 secondary schools will have this course from July 1981. By 1983, all secondary schools should have computer appreciation clubs as an extra-curricular activity. For this purpose, each secondary school will have a micro-computer system. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>The Special Assistance Plan Schools</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Assistance Plan (SAP) was introduced in 1979 in nine established secondary schools. These schools admit pupils who are within the top 10% of those who passed the Primary School Leaving Examination. Students in SAP schools sit for their GCE 'O' level examination in English. The brightest among them do English and Chinese at the first language level. Their schools provide them with a suitable environment to achieve this. Thus, the Ministry has provided SAP schools with better facilities like air-conditioned language laboratories and libraries and better staffing quota (about 12% more for SAP schools with double sessions and 30% more for those on full day). Pupils from the Chinese medium schools are given additional support in the form of an immersion programme in good English schools or a supplementary English Language programme in their own schools. A supplementary Chinese Language programme is offered to pupils from English medium primary schools. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pupils in the SAP schools will enjoy certain privileges. If they pass both first languages and qualify for admission to junior colleges, they will be given priority in their choice of colleges. Pupils with a grade of at least E8 in one of the two first languages and a grade of C6 in the other will be considered as having satisfied the language requirement for pre-university admission. If they obtain a grade of C6 for Chinese as First Language (CL1) at 'O' level, they will be considered to have satisfied the second language requirement for admission to the university and will be exempted from doing Chinese as Second Language (CL2) at pre-university. Pupils will also be allowed to revert to CL2 if they are unable to cope with two first languages. Pupils at the end of Secondary 3 will be allowed to sit the 'O' level CL2 paper, If they obtain a minimum CL2 grade for pre-university admission, they need not do further Chinese Language papers at 'O' level. This is to allow them to concentrate on English in Secondary 4. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 20</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>School Administration and Appraisal</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the education system in the last two years have been complemented by changes in the management of schools. Principals are encouraged to take on more responsibility and authority. For example, the guidance, supervision and assessment of teachers in schools are no longer the responsibilities of inspectors of schools; they are now entirely the responsibilities of principals. Principals are now also responsible for the development of school work plans and the implementation and evaluation of the instructional programmes of their schools. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A set of school work plans consists of a brief three-year rolling plan and a detailed annual work plan for the current year. The plans identify the school's policy and goals; examine pupil inputs, teacher resources, school facilities, and other resources; establish priorities; and set targets. The detailed annual work plan provides clear guidance and direction to the teaching staff in planning instructional strategies, developing instructional programmes and preparing schemes of work for the year. A good part of 1979 was devoted to orientating principals in this new task of planning. A set of guidelines, including suggested formats for the plans, was developed by the Ministry and given to the principals. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School appraisal comprises two components; the self-appraisal and the external appraisal. The orientation of principals and key teachers for the self-appraisal exercise commenced in 1980. By the end of the year, over 140 primary and 130 secondary schools have been prepared for this exercise. By April 1981, the remaining schools will have been covered. Guidelines have been issued to schools. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External appraisal of each school is carried out by a team of three inspectors of schools. The team is augmented by relevant subject specialist inspectors. It spends a week to 10 days in a school gathering information; observing teachers at work to evaluate the teaching and learning programmes: checking documents and pupils' written assignments: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> and interacting with teachers and pupils. The findings and recommendations of the external appraisal team are conveyed to the school in the form of an external appraisal report. The school develops follow-up activities, including the drawing-up of action plans for the areas identified as needing improvement. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980, 16 primary and four secondary schools were externally appraised. In 1981, 40 primary and 28 secondary schools will be externally appraised. Thereafter, the annual rate will be 56 primary and 28 secondary schools. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the system was first introduced, there was widespread apprehension among principals and teachers. There was also complaint about additional work load. These mis-givings are slowly dissipating as teachers and principals see the value of the new approach. This method of school inspection was adapted from the one used in some states in Australia. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Institute of Education</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute of Education (IE) was set up in 1973. Because attention was directed at more pressing problems in schools, little consideration was given to the physical expansion and manpower requirements of the Institute. Considering the difficult conditions and adverse environment under which the Institute's staff had to work in past years, the results they achieved were remarkable. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute trains those who carry out education policies and programmes - the teachers. Because of this, the Ministry will accord its top priority to raising the professional standards of the Institute. Two independent reviews on the Institute were carried out, one in 1979 on the administrative aspects by a team led by Miss Lim Hsiu Mei, a senior administrator; and one in 1980 on the professional aspects by Dr William Taylor, Director of the University of London Institute of Education. The recommendations of the review teams have been accepted and are being implemented. Dr Taylor has accepted appointment as expert consultant to the Ministry on the Institute's \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> development. In the years to come, the development of IE's professional staff will be given top priority. Scholarships for higher degrees will be available for talented lecturers as well as talented teachers who will join the Institute. Sabbatical leave overseas for its staff will be resumed. More good lecturers will be recruited, locally and overseas, to strengthen the quality of the Institute. The salary scales for lecturers have been revised and new facilities have been, or will be, provided. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Development of Computer Services in the Ministry</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1979, the Ministry purchased a mini-computer system. A Computer Services Branch was set up to develop a comprehensive computer-based management information system for the Ministry. In 1980, the Ministry conducted a massive data-capturing exercise for the 500,000 pupils in schools. This input forms the basis of the new Pupil Data Bank comprising information on the pupils' personal and schooling particulars, family background and home environment. A data verification exercise was also conducted for 20,000 teachers to re-vamp the Teacher Data Bank. The new Teacher Data Bank contains teachers' personal particulars, their academic and professional qualifications, their appointments and other achievements. The Ministry is also developing a School Data Bank to capture information on pupil enrolments, staffing, physical facilities and equipment, ind academic performances of schools. An occurrence slip reporting system was also implemented to keep track of information changes. The three data banks are partially operational and will be fully operational by mid-1981. The Ministry received substantial assistance from MINDEF's systems analysts, without whose contribution the targets set could not have been met in time. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computerised management information system provides accurate information promptly. The system also reduces administrative work. For example, previously, clerks had to update and prepare the curriculum vitae of individual teachers when- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> ever they are needed. Now, the computer can print an accurate curriculum vitae of a teacher in a minute, saving many man-hours of file searching and typing. The system also provides services to schools, for example, providing analyses of pupils to help schools prepare their school plans. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will be taking over the computerised examination and posting systems from the Ministry of Finance's Computer Services Department. The financial control systems of the Ministry, IE and CDIS will be computerised. Student and staff data at IE will also be computerised. A curriculum data base will be set up to monitor textbooks and instructional materials available for each subject. Cataloguing of books and retrieval of information in the libraries of the Ministry, IE and CDIS will also be fully computerised by the mid-1980's. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The management information system is still in its infancy. Users, for example, school principals, will need to be made more aware of the benefits of immediate access to information stored in the computer. Orientation courses will be conducted for them but because of the large numbers involved, it may take up to two years or more to complete these courses. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Proposed Innovations</i> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>(a) Senior Education Service</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major problem faced by the Ministry is how to attract good officers to take up positions of responsibility in the Education Service. At present, most teachers are unwilling to work at Ministry Headquarters (HQ). This is unlike in the United Kingdom where there is strong competition to join Her Majesty's Inspectorate, an elite professional corps. Members of the Inspectorate are experienced professional officers and are highly paid. This is also the case in France, where the general inspectors are distinguished officers of proven merit and high intellect. In contrast, there is no incentive for our good teachers to work in HQ. Officers at HQ lose their school holidays, work longer hours and in unfamiliar conditions but draw the same or even less pay than their counter- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> parts in the schools. Principals and vice-principals, for example, lose their allowances (up to $300 pm) when they join HQ. Teachers are also fearful of losing face should they be posted back to schools as teachers when their services at HQ are no longer required. The dismantling of the Education Development Division caused much anguish in the profession. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recognise talent in the Education Service and to attract good officers to take up positions of responsibility, the Ministry proposes to introduce a Senior Education Service (SES). Key posts in HQ and schools will be designated as Upper Timescale posts, with the most important of them graded Superscale posts. These posts will eventually be held by officers in the SES. All serving officers can apply to be in the SES if they meet minimum requirements laid down by the Ministry. Those who choose not to apply for the SES will remain in the Education Service. Their promotion prospects will end at the Upper Timescale. There are many good teachers, especially among women, who enjoy teaching and do not wish to hold staff appointments in schools or the Ministry. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promising young officers will be identified and tested for the SES. If found suitable, they will be sent for higher degrees or specialist training, either overseas or locally. In 1980, six officers were sent overseas for postgraduate studies. The Ministry hopes to send 10-15 officers for postgraduate and specialist courses each year. The National University of Singapore (NUS) has agreed to set up a Graduate Centre for Education. Many talented married women teachers, unwilling to take overseas courses, will be able to get their Masters and Doctorates in Singapore when the Centre is established. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>(b) Schools Council</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more intractable problems of our education system lies in the area of communication between Ministry Headquarters, where decisions on policy are made, and the schools where they are implemented. The flow tends to be downwards from Ministry to schools in the form of circulars and direc- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> tives. The reverse flow does take place but is inadequate. Sometimes it takes the shape of formal enquiries through questionnaires. At other times, contacts are informal through discussions with a few principals or teachers. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schools Division, whose inspectors are in constant contact with schools, maintains good and continuous liaison with schools. Discussions centre on particular problems of each school but basic Ministry policies are seldom examined. Professionals developing and testing new teaching materials also maintain contact with schools but only a few schools are involved in each project. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lateral flow of information between schools is very restricted. Except for sports meetings and some extra-curricular projects, schools mind their own business as they have no reason to do otherwise. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One consequence of all this is that policy-thinking in the Ministry is not thoroughly understood by principals and teachers in schools. As a result, the Ministry has established a reputation for being, to quote a Systems Engineer in the Ministry, \"at best a mystery, at worst a place of confusion\". Such a state is not conducive to efficient management and needs to be changed. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools must be made aware of policy-thinking in the Ministry before decisions are reached and embodied in directives or circulars. That is to say, they must be involved in the decision-making process so that when decisions are made, they have thoroughly understood the reasons for the decisions and have a clear perception of objectives to be attained. Implementation will then be effective and accurate. The Japanese system of management, now accepted by many experts as having great merit, emphasises the importance of adequate flows of information throughout the system. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this objective, the Ministry proposes to establish a Schools Council. In the first stage, this will be confined to secondary \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> schools and junior colleges. The Ministry will be represented by the political leadership and the administrative and professional heads. Schools will be represented by 20 principals selected by the Ministry. However, all principals of secondary schools and junior colleges will be invited to witness the proceedings of the Schools Council through closed circuit television at the Division of Educational Technology premises next to the Ministry. They will also be provided in advance with reports and study papers to be discussed by the Schools Council. They will be free to express their opinion on any subject by memorandum. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A catalogue of reports and study papers discussed in the Ministry during 1980 is being prepared and will soon be circulated to the schools. The catalogue contains 550 titles. Principals and teachers may obtain copies of any paper for a modest fee. These documents will also be made available to the media for background information only and not for publication without the approval of the Ministry. The media have the important role of informing the public of education policies. To discharge this function properly, they themselves must be adequately informed. The same access to Ministry documents will be made available to Members of Parliament. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>(c) Full-day Schools</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pilot project has been introduced this year for two primary and three secondary schools to function as full-day schools. A full-day school starts at 7.30 am and ends at about 3.00 pm. The additional curriculum time is used mainly for the teaching of the various subjects. However, the curriculum remains unchanged. The extended school day allows pupils to remain in school for self-study, homework, or extra-curricular activities, thus leaving Saturdays free of school activities. To maintain the same workload as before for teachers in full-day schools, the staffing ratio has been increased by about 30%. Shortages of teaching staff and building construction capacity are the main constraints on rapid expansion of full-day schools. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Major Areas of Concern</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the new education system requires professional expertise in various fields of education. One area is testing. With our emphasis on streaming, it is necessary to build up a strong core of trained experts in testing. Talented officers will be sent on scholarships for higher degrees in testing or attached to major testing projects for specialist training. Last year, two officers were attached to the Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) in Australia. To date, eight officers have been sent abroad for training and six have returned with post-graduate qualifications in testing. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major area is the teaching of English Language in our schools. The Morris and Thomson Report on Curriculum Development in Singapore (September 1979) has recommended a review of English Language teaching. The Ministry has engaged an eminent linguistic expert, Professor H.G. Widdowson from the University of London, to undertake a preliminary study. Professor Widdowson will take a broad look at English Language teaching and identify the problem areas which will then be studied by a team of experts. As a short term measure, the Ministry is recruiting expatriate teachers in English to fill part of the vacancies for English Language teachers in our schools. As a long term measure, the Ministry has introduced a SALUTE Scholarship Scheme to train more graduate teachers of English by offering scholarships to pre-university students. After their General Cambridge Examination 'A' level, these students do an undergraduate degree in English and later join the education service. The Public Service Commission (PSC) has also taken significant steps to train more graduate teachers. All along, PSC has awarded teaching scholarships and bursaries. However, recognising the urgent need to have more graduate teachers, PSC has increased greatly the number of such awards since 1976. Between 1976 and 1980, a total of 727 teaching awards were granted. Starting from 1979, PSC also requires students awarded teaching scholarships tenable in the Science and Arts \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Faculties of the NUS to do English Language as one of their subjects. The aim is to enable them later to teach English Language as well as their subjects of specialisation. Since the implementation of the scheme, 155 students on teaching awards have been admitted to the English Language course. The measures taken by PSC have contributed towards improving the quality of teaching in our schools. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the high demand for places in schools, much of the space in our schools has to be used for classrooms. As a result, other facilities cannot be adequately provided. Staff rooms and school libraries are smaller than desirable. There is also a lack of special rooms such as audio-visual rooms. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next three years, a total of 48 primary and 22 secondary schools will be built. Seven junior colleges will also be built in the next five years. New schools will have bigger staff rooms, bigger libraries and special rooms. Overcrowding in existing schools will be alleviated. Some of the classrooms in existing schools can be converted for special purposes. We will improve the physical facilities in existing schools to the latest building standards, where possible. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes in the composition of our teachers is another area of concern. Among our younger teachers, i.e. those 30 years or younger, there are 3,026 females (81%) and 724 males (19%). Extra-curricular activities such as rugby and soccer which traditionally require the charge of a male teacher will be affected by the decreasing number of male teachers. Furthermore, our male pupils may be increasingly deprived of a male image to look up to and emulate. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our female teachers will eventually raise families of their own. At present, most of our schools function on a half-day and married female teachers have time to take care of their own children for the other half of the day. With full-day school, these teachers will have less time to take care of their children. Some may consider leaving the teaching service to look after their children. It may be an advantage to introduce a system of part-time teachers. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue the development of computer services for the Ministry and schools, the Ministry needs to expand its data processing staff. This will be difficult. Because the salaries for systems analysts and programmers in the Computer Service are less than those offered in the private sector, the Computer Service has found it difficult to retain trained staff. There is a dearth of systems analysts and programmers in the Ministry and half of the posts are vacant. We also have a high staff turnover rate of 33% in 1979 and 22% in 1980. This means that we are continuously losing those systems analysts and programmers who have experience, and we have to continuously train new staff, a costly affair. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    GOH KENG SWEE \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\"> \n   <i>First Deputy Prime Minister</i> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</b> \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n    BUDGET DIVISION \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget system will be improved. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Programme and Performance Budgeting, introduced in 1978, we shall add a financial management system to check on the carrying out of the 10-Year Economic and Social Development Plan. The Ministry of Finance will help each Ministry to set up its own Financial Management Information System (FMIS). The total system will (a) control and direct programmes and projects, (b) see if the policy and the operational and financial objectives and targets are being followed, (c) make any changes and modifications necessary to achieve this, and (d) in the large Ministries, computerise the large amounts of data in the FMIS for quick evaluation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance will effect greater computerisation in the Civil Service. For this the Management Services Department of the Ministry will be strengthened so that it can better advise and assist other Ministries on the introduction and operation of computers. The Management Services Department will also provide more consultancy services on \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> computerisation and management, data processing and information management. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n    REVENUE DIVISION \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Monetary Policy</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our monetary policy will continue to be designed to help sustain economic growth. We shall permit such expansion of the money supply as to achieve a real growth of 8 - 10% per year for our economy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are reviewing the Insurance Act, which was introduced in January 1967. The insurance industry has grown in scale and depth in the last decade. The new law will recognise the changed needs and help meet the objective of developing Singapore into an important insurance centre. The Banking Act and the Finance Companies Act will likewise be reviewed. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Gold Trading Act is being considered. It will provide for the licensing of companies trading in gold and gold futures to protect the public and to promote the orderly development of the market. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Taxation Policy</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall continue to rely mainly on economic expansion for increased revenue to meet public expenditure. Our taxation policies will support economic and social policies. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal income tax rates will be reduced periodically in the next two to three years. There will be sufficient incentive for effort, enterprise and talent. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    HON SUI SEN \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\"> \n   <i>Minister for Finance</i> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MINISTRY OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world economy will continue to suffer from slow growth and high inflation in the next few years. Singapore will have to restructure its economy in a forbidding international economic environment. We aim to \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> build a modern industrial economy based on science, technology, skills and knowledge. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving away from low-skilled labour-intensive industries. Without natural resources, we have to raise the skills and productivity of our human resources. Rigorous scientific education and practical industrial training will be given to our students and labour force. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will offer through the Economic Development Board, fixed interest long-term financing to encourage the private sector, local and foreign, to establish industries to produce high value-added products such as computer equipment, photo-copying machines, optical instruments, fine chemicals, basic pharmaceuticals, automotive parts, scientific instruments, precision machine tools, oil field equipment and aircraft components. More dollar-for-dollar grants will be given to help companies in their research and development efforts. Our young professionals will be helped through loans to establish and expand key supporting industries to supply the needs of multi-national corporations. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security of supplies, particularly oil and other energy resources, will also be a major concern of the Ministry. The Department of Trade will search out dependable sources of raw - materials, food supplies and energy resources. Its other equally important task is to find new export markets for our manufactured products. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is taking steps to diversify and secure oil supply. As oil will become more expensive, we must be efficient in the use of energy. We must diligently practise energy conservation. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will curb attempts at profiteering by unscrupulous traders. Singaporeans, however, must pay the prevailing market price for oil, grains and other necessities. \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>PUBLIC UTILITIES BOARD</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Utilities Board will expand its facilities to meet the demand for electricity \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> and water. It will spend about $2,200 million on development projects over the next five years. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Electricity</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore relies totally on imported oil to meet its energy requirements. Electricity demand is expected to increase by 10% annually. $596 million were spent on fuel oil to generate electricity in 1980. The expenditure will go up to over $900 million in 1981, partly because of increased electricity consumption, but mainly because of higher cost of fuel oil. The Board plans to remove the promotional block rates of non-domestic electricity tariffs to discourage wastage and inefficient use of electricity. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uncertainty of oil supply is a serious problem. Power Stations will be modified so that they can use different types and grades of fuel oil. The feasibility of a coal power station will be studied. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will construct two new power projects - a 80 MW gas turbine at Pasir Panjang Power Station to augment power supply during peak hours and emergencies and a new power station on Pulau Seraya. The gas turbine will operate from 1982 and the first stage of 700 MW for the Pulau Seraya Power Station from 1987. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Water</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water consumption is increasing at too fast a rate. If not checked, there will be a shortage of water in the future. Water tariffs may have to be revised to discourage excessive use of this scarce resource. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two reservoirs at Sungei Seletar and Bedok will be built. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Gas</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gas Department will not be building new gas works in the next few years because of difficulty in getting a suitable site. In HDB estates with gas supply, only a third of households use it; the majority use bottled gas. Naphtha is the main feedstock for gas production. It will become more expensive as it is derived from crude oil and is also the feedstock for petrochemical plants. These \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> factors, including the high cost of laying new pipeline reticulations, will make the production and distribution of gas less economic in the future. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board, however, is replacing five obsolete units of gas-making plants at Kallang Gasworks with a pollution-free naphtha reformer. This new gas-making plant will increase the capacity of Kallang Gasworks to meet modest increase in demand for piped gas over the next few years. It will be completed by end 1981. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    GOH CHOK TONG \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\"> \n   <i>Minister for Trade and Industry</i> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MINISTRY OF DEFENCE</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political uncertainties and security threats continue in this region. Vietnamese aggressiveness and the Kampuchean question are not likely to be resolved for some time. Defence is thus of vital importance to Singapore. Without security and stability we shall not survive. The defence of Singapore is in the hands of its people. To live in peace and harmony, every citizen must be prepared to defend his home and country. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our resources and manpower are limited. Our defence must be built on national service. The emphasis in the next five years will be to upgrade the quality of our manpower, to improve our defence management systems, and to acquire better equipment and weaponry. Special attention will be given to the physical fitness of every member of the SAF, career development of the officer corps, reservist training, and upgrading of the Air Force and the Navy. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Physical Fitness</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physical fitness is of utmost importance to every SAF member. The Ministry will have better professional instructors, install new physical training equipment, and provide a wider range of sports amenities in all SAF camps. Every SAF unit will conduct more rigorous training programmes to get SAF \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> members to make keeping physically fit a life-long habit. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will help the schools in their physical training programmes to build up the physical fitness of school boys before they are enlisted into the SAF. The Ministry will encourage reservists to maintain a high standard of physical fitness. Physical training instructors and equipment will be made available for training to be conducted at more community centres. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Career Development of SAF Officers</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF will offer more overseas training awards and local university scholarships to newly-commissioned officers to improve the quality of manpower in its officer cadre. Promising SAF officers with some experience will be sent overseas for advanced military training to improve their professional skills. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New schemes of service will be introduced to encourage good national service NCOs to become regulars. These NCOs will be trained in a wide range of skills, assets when they eventually enter the private sector. Certain appointments in the civil service and the statutory boards will be reserved for them after they have served a number of years in the SAF. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Improving Reservist Training</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main fighting strength of the SAF is in the Reserves. Hence, reservists will be given more intensive in-camp training. Reservist officers will be trained to shoulder greater responsibilities. Selected reservist officers, especially those who have distinguished themselves in their civilian careers, will attend special higher staff and command courses to equip them for senior staff and command appointments. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry seeks the understanding and co-operation of employers to release employees who are reservist officers to attend upgrading courses. The Ministry will convince private sector employers to follow public sector practice, in taking into account the rank and performance of these employees when considering their career development. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Improvements to the RSAF and RSN</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Air Force and the Navy will develop higher skills in their personnel. Selected officers will be sent for advanced courses and specialised training, either locally or overseas. The Pilot Training School will strive for higher standards. The Schools of Midshipman and Naval Training will upgrade the quality of their graduates. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Better Management Systems</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will introduce more advanced computer systems and systems engineering techniques to increase productivity and efficiency in defence management. SAF officers will be trained increasingly in the use of computers in order to deal with advanced military operations and weapons systems. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Control of Drug Abuse</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has met with some success in controlling the drug problem among national servicemen. It will intensify its efforts to detect, monitor, and rehabilitate drug-takers among national servicemen to minimise, if not eliminate, the drug problem. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Conclusion</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few years the SAF will be a more efficient and professional organization, with every SAF member having better training, higher morale, and a greater sense of belonging and contributing his best for the defence of Singapore. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    HOWE YOON CHONG \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\"> \n   <i>Minister of Defence</i> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s the Ministry will continue to devote its energies to the maintenance of internal security, suppression of crime, combat of drug abuse and enforcement of road discipline. However, manpower will be increasingly scarce and the Ministry will have to make up for this by recruiting better quality officers, reducing the enforcement \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> workload through the prevention of offences, and extensively computerising the work. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A System Study Team has studied the Ministry's computerisation needs and recommended the installation of four inter-linked systems. These systems deal with personal records of Singapore residents, immigration records, police operations and police administrative records. One sub-system which will come into operation this year will speed up screening at the Woodlands and Railways Checkpoints. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Internal Security</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term threat to Singapore's internal security is the underground Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) and its satellite organisations. In the 1970s the Internal Security Department (ISD) arrested many of their members and sympathisers. As a result it is lying low. In the 1980s the ISD will continue to watch the communists and prevent them from rebuilding their underground networks and penetrating trade unions, institutions of learning, cultural and other organisations. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another threat to Singapore's internal security will be Muslim fundamentalism. ISD will keep surveillance on foreigners who try to instigate Singaporean Muslims and on Singaporean Muslims who flirt with foreign extremists. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign students and workers will be coming to Singapore in increasing numbers. ISD will keep a lookout for communists and religious extremists amongst them. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Crime</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Police Force (SPF) cadre will be considerably strengthened in the next few years when SPF and other Scholars return from their studies. They will help to modernise and manage a Force that will use the computer to screen persons, vehicles and properties, record and track the development of incidents and control the fleet of patrol cars. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public with the help of the Police will have to play an increasing role in crime pre- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> vention. In the last five years thefts and housebreakings accounted for more than 60% of all seizable offences. Most of the thefts and housebreakings could have been prevented if the victims had been more careful. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A National Crime Prevention Council will be set up consisting of influential representatives from the commercial, manufacturing, construction and insurance sectors, the Security Industry, Police and the Ministry of Home Affairs. Under this Council smaller groups will deal with security in specific areas such as commercial buildings, private housing, public housing etc. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police will enlarge and upgrade its Crime Prevention Branch to give the crime prevention programme impetus and support. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Drug Abuse</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drug abuse situation in Singapore is under control. The Ministry will use this opportunity to rehabilitate more drug addicts. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, drugs of abuse are easily available across the Causeway and it is difficult to stop the 'ant traffic' of drugs into Singapore so long as there is a demand for it. In the long run the solution is to immunise our youths against drug abuse. This must be done in the early years of schooling so that as many as possible of the premature school-leavers are immunised before they leave school. The Central Narcotics Bureau will collaborate with the Ministry of Education to educate pupils on the dangers of drug abuse. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Road Safety</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police is finalising a Master Plan to make roads safer. The first pan of the Plan is aimed at helping all road users avoid accidents. It includes road safety education for the public and the school-going population and the training and licensing of motorists. The other part deals with enforcement against errant road users, deterrence for those who are faulted and re-training of motorists who are a source of danger on the road. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master Plan will also set out ways of better co-ordination among all the authorities which are involved with road safety. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    CHUA SIAN CHIN \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\"> \n   <i>Minister for Home Affairs</i> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Water Pollution Control</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large areas of land are used as water catchments. We must not allow any development to pollute our water resources. Over the next five years, we will extend sewerage and drainage systems at a cost of $820 million to serve new developments in water catchments and other areas. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme to clean up Singapore River, Kallang Basin and all water catchments has been approved and is being implemented. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximately 250,000 pigs will be phased out in all water catchments and other areas by December 1983. All remaining pig farms will be provided with proper pig waste treatment facilities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few years, we will resite the remaining 3,500 street hawkers into markets and food centres where pollution can be controlled. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 10,000 rundown premises without proper sanitation in the Singapore River/Kallang Basin will be redeveloped. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighters and other boats operating in the Singapore River, Kallang Basin and Telok Ayer Basin will be relocated to Pasir Panjang by 1984. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Air Pollution Control</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 10 years, we have brought under control the emissions from factories. However, motor vehicles are still a major source of air pollution especially in the urban areas. The Registry of Vehicles will soon periodically check petrol-driven vehicles for their emissions and roadworthiness, as is \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> currently being done with diesel vehicles. It will set emission standards for new vehicles. It will also study the feasibility of using liquified petroleum gas (LPG) in taxis and buses to reduce smoke pollution. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the construction of the petro-chemical complex, more chemical and petro-chemical industries will be set up. We may amend our existing legislation to control environmental pollution problems posed by such industries. We will send more engineers abroad for practical training to cope with these new problems. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Productivity and Energy Conservation</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use a lot of fuel and manpower to collect refuse, sweep roads and operate our sewage treatment plants. It will become more difficult to recruit workers. Over the next few years, the Ministry will direct its attention to energy conservation and improving productivity as it expands the services. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A computer has been installed to assist management in the better maintenance of refuse collection and road sweeping vehicles. We will further improve the productivity of our refuse collection operations by using computers to optimise route and load distribution of our refuse vehicles. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may introduce refuse collection and street cleaning in the central business areas at night to improve refuse collection efficiency and avoid traffic congestion. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will further automate sewage pumping stations and sewage treatment works to reduce operating costs and manpower. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The digestion of sludge at sewage treatment works produces methane gas which partly supplies the energy requirements of the works. We will maximise the production of methane gas through better control of the sludge digestion plants. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to educate the public against mosquito breeding. Priority will be given to repair damaged or sunken drains \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> which are a common source of mosquito breeding. This will reduce the need to oil drains and save costs on anti-mosquito oil. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    ONG PANG BOON \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\"> \n   <i>Minister for the Environment</i> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Objectives</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality and scope of the public medical service will be improved but Singaporeans must carry a fair share of the costs.

Concurrently, greater attention will be given to major prevailing illnesses such as lung cancer, coronary heart diseases, hypertension, mental illness and industrial diseases. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The medical service is a high value-added industry with economic potential. Demand in Singapore and the region for specialised medical services will increase. Singapore can become a regional medical centre. This objective will be achieved without sacrificing progress in the national health care system. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Medical Facilities</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better and more sophisticated facilities will be available when the new Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and the new Kent Ridge Hospital are completed by 1982 and 1985 respectively. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More Class B2 beds will be created in the new SGH and in existing hospitals. They were first introduced in Toa Payoh Hospital and Kandang Kerbau Hospital last year. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Progress in Clinical Work</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recently established Department of Nuclear Medicine in the new SGH will offer a wider range of diagnostic and therapeutic facilities, including scanning systems. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coronary by-pass surgery is being undertaken by the Department of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery at Tan Tock Seng \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> Hospital (TTSH). This service was developed with assistance from a team of specialists in coronary by-pass surgery from Cleveland, United States, in March last year. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doctors are being trained in microsurgery in the fields of Orthopaedic Surgery, Ophthalmology, ENT and Neurosurgery in SGH and TTSH. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treatment for the mentally ill will be improved. Woodbridge Hospital will have more beds for acute cases to undergo longer inpatient treatment to minimise relapses. The opening of the Mandalay Day Centre in January this year will facilitate the rehabilitation of mental patients. This is a pilot scheme to provide discharged psychiatric patients with useful employment while recuperating from mental illness. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Primary Health Care and Health Education</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four new-type polyclinics were opened during the last two years. The Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic will become operational in mid-1981. More will be built in the HDB new towns. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Family Planning</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Family Planning and Population Board will discourage early marriages of people before 21 years and encourage the spacing of children. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Health Manpower</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of health service depends on the availability of good doctors and supporting personnel, especially nurses. More young doctors will be encouraged to specialise, particularly in fields which are most needed. Renowned foreign consultants will be invited for short teaching stints in Singapore. More qualified foreign nurses will be recruited when necessary. The intake of trainee nurses will be stepped up to meet national requirements. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    GOH CHOK TONG \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\"> \n   <i>Minister for Health</i> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s it will become more obvious that -our domestic political and economic developments cannot be divorced from international politics. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the invasion of Kampuchea, Singapore's foreign policy has been one of concerted action with our ASEAN partners. In 1979, ASEAN countries, at the United Nations, proved their ability to mobilise a majority of world opinion to support them on this question. In 1980, we enhanced this support. In the economic field, ASEAN dialogues with our major trading partners have continued. This framework of cooperation and goodwill has been invaluable in persuading our major trading partners to liberalise their trade policies and to encourage a freer flow of investment. This regional approach has made for a more effective foreign policy than if we had acted on our own. This applies to each of the ASEAN five. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN is taken seriously by friends and adversaries. The world is aware that ASEAN does make an impact. Even countries which had attacked ASEAN or been critical of it, like the Soviet Union and, formerly, the People's Republic of China, are varying their attitudes towards ASEAN. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s, Singapore and ASEAN will face problems in two areas. The global economy will suffer from the legacies of the 1970s. There will be growing unemployment in the industrialised countries where our markets lie. We must expect even more stringent measures by some of them as they act to put their and the global economy right. We, together with ASEAN, will have to ensure that our legitimate economic interests are not ignored. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the political field, the declared objective of communist powers remains that of inciting communist revolutions everywhere. We must expect them to persist in stirring up trouble. In Southeast Asia, the revolution will be projected through proxies. Vietnam, despite an ailing economy, still pursues its policy of militarisation, through Soviet mili- \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> tary aid. Today Vietnam has some 2.3 million men under arms. We should be under no illusion that this is purely for defensive purposes. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can meet these challenges through collective action with others who, like us, are convinced that this communist challenge can be frustrated. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coming decade holds many unpredictable crises. So long as we concentrate on fundamental principles to meet realities, however unpleasant, Singapore will ride through what looks like the most turbulent post-war decade. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    S.

The most up-to-date equipment and navigational aids have been incorporated to ensure safe and fast operations. We will launch a programme to familiarise the public with the new airport well before it opens. In keeping with the better services provided at Changi, the Meteorological Department will purchase new aids and equipment costing more than $5 million. This will improve the accuracy and timeliness of weather forecasts required for the efficient handling of aircraft. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our telephone network will be expanded. The target for 1981 is 33 telephones for every 100 persons in Singapore. The programme will replace rotary-dial telephones with push-button ones. This should increase the reliability of telephone services. Telex services will be upgraded. A computerised electronic teleprinter will soon be offered to telex subscribers to speed up the sending of messages. Insurance companies, travel agents and the computer software industry will benefit from more sophisticated telecommunication services. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The container port will be expanded at a cost of $220 million to meet increasing demand. To complement the port, four new warehouses will be constructed at a cost of $150 million. Advanced cargo handling equipment and computers will be used so that more cargo can be handled with less manpower. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Postal services will be upgraded through the use of sophisticated sorting machines.

The Board will promote continuing education and training programmes, especially those approved by the Skills Development Council. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    AHMAD MATTAR \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\"> \n   <i>Minister-in-Charge of Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Technical College and Vocational and Industrial Training Board</i> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\"> \n   <b>MINISTRY OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS</b> \n  </div> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Social Affairs has traditionally concentrated on the alleviation of hardship and the rehabilitation of the disadvantaged. It will now shift its emphasis from the purely remedial to the developmental and preventive aspects of social welfare. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980 the Ministry commenced a reappraisal of its services. Services which are found not to be relevant to today's needs will be discontinued. Staff who are thus released will be enlisted to work on new services, especially in Social Research and Community Development. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>The Family and the Community</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry now has a Community Development Section which is responsible for introducing new programmes designed to strengthen the family unit and to foster the evolution of a cohesive and tightly-knit society. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A family day-care scheme was launched in October last year. This scheme enables working mothers to leave their young children in the care of carefully chosen childminders. The response to the scheme from both care-users and care-givers has been encouraging so far. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Development Section will work closely with the NTUC and voluntary organisations in the running of creches and kindergartens. Creches and kindergartens are not merely a convenience for working mothers. They will be run by trained staff who are conscious of the importance of child development. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents' Committees (RCs) have a crucial role to play in the evolution of cohesive communities in HDB estates. The Community Development Section will run training courses on the principles and techniques of community work for members of RCs and for the staff of the RC Secretariat. The Section will also assist RCs in the design and execution of neighbourhood projects. In the years ahead, an increasing share of the Ministry's resources will be devoted to assisting RCs. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Social Services</i> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Children and Youth</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty was once the main underlying cause of behavioural problems among children and youth. It no longer is. Today's delinquents are increasingly the product of a stressful home environment. Rehabilitative programmes will be modified to suit the changing character of delinquency. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voluntary organisations have always played a valuable role in caring for ill-treated, neglected and abandoned children. Every encouragement will be given to these organisations to raise funds and recruit staff to enable them to expand their services. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>The Disabled</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations has proclaimed 1981 as the International Year of Disabled Persons. During this year, the Ministry will step up its programme of public education to instil in the minds of the public the vast potential in re-integrating disabled persons into the mainstream of life. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not enough has been done to train the disabled to take up gainful employment. Vocational training for the disabled, numbering about 12,000, has assumed even greater importance in the context of the shortage of unskilled and semi-skilled workers in the Republic. The Ministry will co-operate with training institutions and employers' organisations to facilitate job placement for the disabled, especially those between 15 and 45 years of age. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of National Development have jointly commenced a study of how building regulations could be amended to create a barrier-free environment within public buildings so that disabled persons could move about with greater ease. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Rehabilitation of Offenders</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehabilitative work has so far been confined to juvenile offenders. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from 1981, the Ministry of Social Affairs will undertake the rehabilitation of adult prisoners. A Prison Welfare Service will be set up under the Ministry consisting of trained rehabilitation officers. The Ministry will strive to bring the current rate of recidivism down to an acceptable level. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Care of the Aged</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The age structure of the population of Singapore will change drastically during the next 20 to 30 years. The number of persons aged 60 years or more will increase from 169,000 now to 319,000 by the close of the century. The welfare of the elderly will become a major concern of the Ministry in future. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has commenced a wide-ranging study of government policies which \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> have a bearing on the welfare of the Aged. Special attention will be given to the importance of superannuation schemes which would enable workers to retire with the assurance of financial security; fiscal, social and housing policies which would arrest the trend towards nuclear families; and measures to instil filial piety and respect for elders in the minds of our young. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Muslim Affairs</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslim community, under the leadership of the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS). has continued to make commendable economic and social progress. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS will assist more Muslim youths to pursue higher education in the Universities and in technical institutions. They must be equipped to play a role in a fast growing and technologically advanced economy. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spiritual and religious needs of Muslims have been catered for. Through selfhelp, the Muslim community has constructed five modern mosques during the period 1975 to 1980. Phase I of the Mosque Building Programme will be completed this year with the opening of a sixth new mosque in Chai Chee/Bedok. MUIS has now embarked on Phase II of the Programme, under which another eight mosques will be constructed during the period 1982 to 1986. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Fire Service</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two developments which have posed a serious challenge to the Singapore Fire Service are: \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the increase in the number of high-rise buildings; and \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the growth of large manufacturing industries which use hazardous materials. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Building Control Division of the Ministry of National Development has laid down stringent fire prevention features for high-rise buildings. Once a building is certified fit for use, the Fire Service will conduct periodic inspections to ensure that its fire exits remain unobstructed and its fire-fighting equipment is in good working order; and hold regular fire drills to familiarise its occupants with evacuation procedure. Severe penalties will be imposed on the owners of high-rise buildings if they fail to abide by fire regulations. The frequency of fire drills will be stepped up, if necessary. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fire Service will pay special attention to the storage facilities and manufacturing processes of large industries which use hazardous materials. It will allow more of these industries to maintain their own fire services. Legislation will be introduced to regulate the setting up of such private fire services. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <i>Sports</i> \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the next four years, the Singapore Sports Council will build seven sports and swimming complexes, two multi-purpose indoor stadia, three squash and tennis complexes and one athletic centre under its Master Plan for Sports Facilities. \n  <br> \n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master Plan for Sports Facilities, which covers the period 1976 to 1992, will be reviewed this year to assess the progress made so far and to revise the programme for the remainder of the Plan period. \n  <div align=\"right\">\n    AHMAD MATTAR \n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\"> \n   <i>Acting Minister for Social Affairs</i> \n  </div>  \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
