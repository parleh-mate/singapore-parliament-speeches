This is to help ease the  credit\r\n\r\nsqueeze on our SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LEFS enhancements have benefited our local companies.\r\n\r\nIn the second quarter of this year, the amount of loan committed\r\n\r\nincreased by 28% to $157 million compared to the second  quarter\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers  may  wish to refer to Tables (Cols. 739-742)  1  and  2\r\n\r\nwhich  have already been distributed.  The enhancements made  to\r\n\r\nshort-term loans, through an increase in risk sharing  and  loan\r\n\r\nquantum,  were  well received, especially for  factoring  loans.\r\n\r\nFor  April to June 1998, factoring loans approved increased from\r\n\r\n$6  million to $41 million, an increase of 650% (See  Table  1),\r\n\r\ncompared to the corresponding period last year.

As at June 1998, total loan commitments stood at $1.49\r\n\r\nbillion,  of  which $630 million have been disbursed.   Table  2\r\n\r\nshows   the  number  of  loan  applications  approved   by   the\r\n\r\nProductivity and Standards Board.  The number has increased from\r\n\r\n1,698 in 1996 to 1,981 in 1997.  It was 889 in the first half of\r\n\r\nthis  year.   I  do  not  have data  on  the  approval  rate  by\r\n\r\nparticipating banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to industry feedback, my Ministry is currently\r\n\r\nstudying further enhancements to the LEFS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen asked if restructuring of loan repayments\r\n\r\nis  allowed  under LEFS.  Such a practice is already  in  place.\r\n\r\nPSB  and  EDB  do  allow companies with healthy order  books  to\r\n\r\nrestructure  their loans based, in the first  instance,  on  the\r\n\r\nparticipating banks' assessment of the credit worthiness of  the\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Could the Minister\r\n\r\nkindly  give the corresponding figures for the total  number  of\r\n\r\nthose who applied for the loans?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, the figures given in Table 2 refer\r\n\r\nto   loan  applications  approved  by  PSB.   PSB  receives  the\r\n\r\napplications after they have been processed by the  banks.   The\r\n\r\ndata that we have at present pertain only to those collected  by\r\n\r\nPSB,  ie, when the loan applications have been processed by  the\r\n\r\nbanks for their credit-worthiness they are then submitted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  PSB  for  final  approval.   The  figures  for  applications\r\n\r\nreceived   and  approved  by  PSB are almost  identical  because\r\n\r\nalmost  every  loan application that finally  comes  to  PSB  is\r\n\r\napproved.  But what we are interested in is the approval rate by\r\n\r\nthe  banks and for that we have to collect the data.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nhave the data at present.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> I notice from the figures in Table 1\r\n\r\nthat  there was actually a drop in the number of approvals  even\r\n\r\nthough  there was an increase in terms of the dollar  amount  of\r\n\r\nloans  approved.   It  seems to me a  bit  odd  that  there  was\r\n\r\nactually  a  drop  in the number of approvals because  the  LEFS\r\n\r\nscheme is meant to help the SMEs and one would expect that there\r\n\r\nwould be an increase in the number of approvals unless of course\r\n\r\nthere  was  a  drop  in  the number of  applicants.   Could  the\r\n\r\nMinister kindly explain the drop in the number of approvals?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> If Members will refer to Table 1, it is\r\n\r\ntrue  that  the  total  number of loan applicants  approved  has\r\n\r\ndropped from 455 for the second quarter of last year to 423  for\r\n\r\nthe  second  quarter  of  this year.   Although  the  number  of\r\n\r\napprovals has decreased the total quantum has increased by  28%,\r\n\r\nas I mentioned just now, from $123 million to $157 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members were to look at the details, the increases are\r\n\r\nmainly in the short-term loans.  For example, factoring loans,\r\n\r\nthe number of applications approved has gone up from 10 to 59\r\n\r\nand the quantum has gone up from $5.5 million to $41.3 million.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for working capital loans, the number of applications\r\n\r\napproved has gone up from 2 to 11 and the quantum has also\r\n\r\nincreased.  On the other hand, the loan applications approved\r\n\r\nfor factory loans have gone down because there were fewer\r\n\r\napplications.  As I explained in my answer, companies are now\r\n\r\ncautious about expanding.  Despite the more generous terms we\r\n\r\nare giving now, such as larger quantums of loans and larger\r\n\r\nfixed assets qualifications for applying under the scheme, the\r\n\r\nactual approval rate has gone down for factory loans.  In other\r\n\r\nwords, for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmachinery  loans,  it has actually gone down for  that  quarter.\r\n\r\nPeople  are  still finding out about the scheme and we  have  to\r\n\r\npublicise it further.  We are hoping that eventually there  will\r\n\r\nbe  some  adjustments.  But in the short-term area,  I think  we\r\n\r\nhave made some significant improvements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B.

The Board has accelerated its efforts  this\r\n\r\nyear.  For  FY98, TDB plans to mount 22 trade missions  to  non-traditional  markets.  Some of the missions  already  undertaken\r\n\r\nthis  year  were  to  Mexico, Finland, the Baltics,  Kazakhstan,\r\n\r\nAzerbaijan   and  East  Africa.  To  date,  45  companies   have\r\n\r\nparticipated in these missions.  In the coming months, TDB plans\r\n\r\nto  organise  missions to Eastern European,  African  and  Latin\r\n\r\nAmerican  countries.  Some 120 to 150 companies are expected  to\r\n\r\nbe involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Productivity and Standards Board (PSB) has\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  help  SMEs seek out business  opportunities  and\r\n\r\nestablish   strategic  partnerships  with  companies   in   non-traditional markets.  Under its Business Connect Programme,  PSB\r\n\r\nhas  facilitated business matching between our  local  SMEs  and\r\n\r\ncompanies in Chile and Australia, for example.  Currently,  2600\r\n\r\ncompanies  have registered under the programme.   650  companies\r\n\r\nhave  benefited  from such business matching activities.   There\r\n\r\nare  plans  to  work  with  TDB  to organise  business  matching\r\n\r\nmissions to newer markets in Latin America and South Africa.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TDB has allocated additional funds to support companies in\r\n\r\ntheir promotional activities this year.  It is estimated that an\r\n\r\nadditional  $10 million will go towards assisting and supporting\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  their  overseas market and  business  development\r\n\r\nactivities.   Activities that are eligible for  support  include\r\n\r\nparticipation   in   missions  and  fairs,  brand   development,\r\n\r\nestablishment of overseas marketing offices, overseas  franchise\r\n\r\ndevelopment and direct marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MALAYSIA'S PROTECTIONIST MEASURES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Impact on Singapore's economy)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Inderjit Singh</b> asked the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry (a) whether there\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  be any significant impact on Singapore's economy when  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  government  block  Malaysian  businesses  from  using\r\n\r\nSingapore's  ports; and (b) whether such protectionist  measures\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Malaysian government is planning breach any  of  the\r\n\r\nWorld Trade Organisation agreements.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from The media reports,\r\n\r\nit  is unclear has reported intentions by some quarters in  what\r\n\r\nmeasures (if any) Malaysia will take to pass legislation to curb\r\n\r\nMalaysian businesses from using Singapore ports.  The details of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  legislation are not available.  If  the  measures\r\n\r\nwhich  run  counter to international rules and  agreements,  are\r\n\r\nimposed, Singapore will not hesitate to bring up the matter with\r\n\r\nthe relevant Malaysian authorities and with international bodies\r\n\r\nsuch as the World Trade Organisation.  This is in line with  the\r\n\r\nfree trading philosophy we subscribe to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any measure taken will impact both Malaysia and Singapore.\r\n\r\nBusinesses  operate most efficiently in an open and fair  market\r\n\r\nplace where they are free to make procurement decisions based on\r\n\r\nthe competitiveness of services and supplies.  Businesses should\r\n\r\nbe  free  to  decide  which port to use on the  basis  of  their\r\n\r\ncommercial needs and considerations.\r\n\r\n.        Singapore and Malaysia's economies are closely linked and\r\n\r\ncomplementary  in  many ways.  Malaysia has  traditionally  been\r\n\r\namongst  Singapore's largest trading partners and top investment\r\n\r\ndestination.   Together,  Singapore  and  Malaysia   provide   a\r\n\r\nplatform   for  a  number  of  MNCs  to  undertake   distributed\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   to  capitalise  on  the  different   comparative\r\n\r\nadvantages of our two countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any move to discourage Malaysian businesses from using\r\n\r\nSingapore  ports  will  hinder bilateral trade  and  investment.\r\n\r\nManufacturers  who  have  invested  in  Malaysia  and  MNCs  who\r\n\r\nundertake distributed manufacturing in both countries will  face\r\n\r\nhigher operating costs and constraints on their operations. This\r\n\r\nmust affect the flow of new investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Our ports serve s diversified markets extending to as\r\n\r\nfar  as  countries like India and Australia.

Of these, 34 are full licensed banks,  including\r\n\r\n22  foreign-owned banks.  They provide a full range  of  banking\r\n\r\nservices  for  domestic consumers.  Another 13 restricted  banks\r\n\r\nfocus on wholesale banking services for corporate customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customers are free to use any bank. If they are\r\n\r\ndissatisfied  with  the services of one,  they  can  take  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  to  another bank.  There are enough  banks  to  choose\r\n\r\nfrom.  It is therefore in the interest of banks to service their\r\n\r\ncustomers well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS requires all banks to uphold high standards of\r\n\r\nprofessional  conduct, so as to preserve the  integrity  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial system as a whole.  The Association of Banks has  also\r\n\r\nissued  a  Code  of  Conduct  for banks.   This  Code  sets  out\r\n\r\nstandards of good banking practice and aims to maintain  a  fair\r\n\r\nrelationship between banks and their customers and confidence in\r\n\r\nthe professionalism of banks.  Consumers who feel that they have\r\n\r\nbeen improperly treated by a bank can bring their complaints  to\r\n\r\nthe  ABS.  The ABS helps consumers resolve their grievances with\r\n\r\nbanks.  The system has worked well.  Besides the ABS,  consumers\r\n\r\ncan also take their complaints to the Consumers' Association  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I wish to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Deputy  Prime Minister whether it is true, as mentioned  in\r\n\r\nrecent press reports, that the banks\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave   been  deliberately  curtailing  their  loans  unduly   to\r\n\r\ncustomers  or  unfairly forcing them to top-up on the  value  of\r\n\r\ntheir collaterals pledged.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, banking is a\r\n\r\nbusiness,  not  a social service.  Banks have to  act  on  sound\r\n\r\ncommercial  considerations.  They cannot afford to extend  loans\r\n\r\nwhich  are  imprudent, or fail to recover loans  which  are  not\r\n\r\nperforming.  Otherwise they will undermine their own  viability,\r\n\r\nlose  money  and run into serious trouble, as recent  events  in\r\n\r\nseveral Asian countries have vividly shown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government and MAS cannot persuade banks to extend\r\n\r\nloans  which  in  the  banks'  judgement  are  not  viable.   If\r\n\r\nGovernment  were to intervene, it would be obliged to compensate\r\n\r\nthe banks should the loans eventually prove irrecoverable.  Then\r\n\r\nwe  would be no different from any of the other countries, whose\r\n\r\ngovernments have sought to influence lending decisions of banks,\r\n\r\nand brought their banking systems to the brink of collapse, with\r\n\r\nbanks  carrying a very high burden of non-performing loans,  and\r\n\r\nrequiring  government  resources,  in  other  words,  taxpayers'\r\n\r\nmoney, to bail them out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, neither has the MAS required banks to\r\n\r\ncurtail  lending  or call on their customers to  top-up  on  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of collateral pledged on their loans.  These are  matters\r\n\r\nfor the banks to decide on, based on the merits of each loan and\r\n\r\ngood  banking practice.  However, banks should take a long  view\r\n\r\nof  their  customers'  prospects and needs,  rather  than  over-reacting  to  the immediate mood of the economy.   A  bank  that\r\n\r\nexpands  loans  recklessly in good times  and  contracts  credit\r\n\r\nunthinkingly in bad will soon acquire a bad reputation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association of Banks has recently advised its members\r\n\r\nnot  to  take  a  short-term  view of  the  viability  of  their\r\n\r\ncustomers'  businesses, or to pull back  loans  that  are  being\r\n\r\nregularly serviced.  Banks can be expected to be cautious in the\r\n\r\ncurrent  slowdown in the Singapore economy.  But  if  all  banks\r\n\r\nwere to pull\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nback loans precipitately, even to good borrowers, the quality of\r\n\r\ntheir loans as a whole will suffer.  It is not in their interest\r\n\r\nto see this happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence to date does not show that the banks are\r\n\r\ncontracting  credit  excessively.  The  total  volume  of  loans\r\n\r\noutstanding has shrunk slightly since the start of the year, but\r\n\r\nthis is mostly because the demand for new loans by companies and\r\n\r\nindividuals has fallen.  Loans outstanding in June 1998 were  2%\r\n\r\nbelow  the level in December 1997, although they were 5%  higher\r\n\r\nthan  the  level a year ago, in June 1997.  Banks have continued\r\n\r\nto  accept  new loans.  Among the major banks, both foreign  and\r\n\r\nlocal,  the value of new loans accepted as a percentage of  loan\r\n\r\napplications was about 87% over the last three months.  In  June\r\n\r\n1998  it  was  actually 105% but that is a  statistical  anomaly\r\n\r\nbecause of the lag between applications and acceptances, and 87%\r\n\r\nis higher than the level of 1997 when only 60% of new loans were\r\n\r\nbeing  accepted,  or in the middle of last year  when  64%  were\r\n\r\nbeing accepted before the economic slowdown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall volume of bank loans also remains high. The\r\n\r\nratio  of loans to deposits in the banking system averaged  108%\r\n\r\nover the last three months.  In June 1998, it was 107%.  This is\r\n\r\nbelow  the peak which was 115% at the end of last year,  but  it\r\n\r\nremains above the levels seen at any time in the last 10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister,\r\n\r\nwhen  he  says customers can complain to the ABS, is  he  saying\r\n\r\nthat  the  ABS  has  the power to adjudicate  on  the  complaint\r\n\r\nbetween the bank and the customer, and the bank has to abide  by\r\n\r\nwhatever decision the ABS makes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The ABS may not have legal powers but\r\n\r\nit has considerable persuasive powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is the Minister aware that the Committee\r\n\r\nappointed to inquire into banking practices has complained about\r\n\r\nthe  relatively  low  ranking of Singapore banks  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nopenness  and  competitiveness as compared with  foreign  banks?\r\n\r\nAnd is the Minister aware\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  in  many  of  these other countries, there  is  a  banking\r\n\r\nombudsman  who has power to adjudicate on complaints  which  the\r\n\r\nbank  has  to  accept whenever he makes a decision  against  the\r\n\r\nbank?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure of the\r\n\r\nrelevance  of  the first half of the Member's statement  to  the\r\n\r\nsecond  half.  Some countries have banking ombudsmen.  There  is\r\n\r\none  in the United Kingdom.  There is one in Australia which  is\r\n\r\nsimilar.   There  is  one  in Canada which  is  different.   The\r\n\r\nBritish  one has powers to award compensation of up to \u0153100,000.\r\n\r\nThe  Australian one has powers to award compensation  of  up  to\r\n\r\n$150,000  but it is binding on the bank only when the  applicant\r\n\r\naccepts  the decision of the ombudsman.  In Canada, neither  the\r\n\r\ncustomers   nor   the  banks  are  bound  by   the   ombudsman's\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  So there are various arrangements in different\r\n\r\ncountries and we have to find a form which suits Singapore.

What is the great objection  to\r\n\r\nappointing  an ombudsman who would look into the  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nsmall  account  holder if he has a complaint?

We  are  ourselves,  we  have  to   find\r\n\r\nmechanisms  which work and not encumber ourselves with  formulas\r\n\r\nwhich  look  good on paper but may or may not work in  practice.\r\n\r\nEven in England, the ombudsman does not have full powers on  all\r\n\r\nmatters.  For example, he cannot deal with the issues which have\r\n\r\nto  do  with the bank's commercial judgement, whether or not  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  loan,  unless  there has been  maladministration  or\r\n\r\nunfair  treatment.  I have not heard complaints that banks  have\r\n\r\ntreated  customers unfairly in Singapore on a very large  scale.\r\n\r\nIf the Member is aware of such cases, perhaps he can bring it up\r\n\r\nto our attention and we will certainly look into the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, in good times the\r\n\r\nbanks  are flushed with money and they encourage their customers\r\n\r\nto  borrow.   In Singapore's case, they do borrow  to  buy  real\r\n\r\nestate property.  It was reported in yesterday's papers that  in\r\n\r\n1985\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, can you ask your question?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes, I am coming to it. The loans made\r\n\r\nby  banks to property purchasers were about $10 billion and this\r\n\r\namount  has  in  fact  grown to about  $64  billion.   With  the\r\n\r\ndownturn  of  the  economy, it would look  like  many  of  these\r\n\r\nproperty purchasers would have to either top-up or, if they  are\r\n\r\nunable  to top-up, pay higher monthly interest.  They will  have\r\n\r\nto fork out ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, are you making a speech? Can you\r\n\r\nget  to the point?  If you are not asking a question, I will ask\r\n\r\nyou to resume your seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> All right. It would appear that many\r\n\r\nof these property purchasers would have to sell their properties\r\n\r\nunder  forced  sale.  Is the Government, in the  absence  of  an\r\n\r\nombudsman, just going to stand by and see this happen?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whether a person\r\n\r\ntakes a loan or does not take a loan is a personal decision.  If\r\n\r\nhe  had  gone to the bank to take a loan, that means he did  not\r\n\r\nbuy  an  HDB  flat.   He had bought a private  property,  and  I\r\n\r\npresume  that he had made his own calculations, and  he  has  to\r\n\r\nlook  after himself.  I would not be surprised if the volume  of\r\n\r\nhousing loans has increased dramatically since 1985.  The number\r\n\r\nof  private  properties  has  gone  up,  the  value  of  private\r\n\r\nproperties  has gone up even now compared to 1985, and  if  bank\r\n\r\nloans  had  not  increased, I think our system would  have  been\r\n\r\nmalfunctioning.  So these matters are private decisions  between\r\n\r\nthe  banks and the borrowers.  As I explained, even in countries\r\n\r\nwhere  you  have an ombudsman, lending decisions are really  the\r\n\r\nbank's  prerogative,  not the ombudsman's prerogative.   If  the\r\n\r\nombudsman has to decide that you may call back this loan or  you\r\n\r\nmay  not  call back that loan, and the ombudsman says  that  you\r\n\r\ncannot  call  back the loan and the loan turns sour,  who  pays?\r\n\r\nThe  bank or the ombudsman?  Is the ombudsman a rich man or does\r\n\r\nhe have the government standing behind him?  So it is not such a\r\n\r\nsimple matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson I draw from the data which Mr Chiam cited is\r\n\r\nthat we have to be very careful not to over expand credit during\r\n\r\ntimes  when  the property market is hot and there is  a  certain\r\n\r\neuphoria and heady whiff in the air, and everybody feels this is\r\n\r\nthe chance, the bankers feel these are safe loans, the borrowers\r\n\r\nfeel  this  is a sure chance to make money, let's go.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhy,  in  1996, we set a limit of 80% of the value of a property\r\n\r\non  mortgage loans, and which is why even now, despite many very\r\n\r\nstrong  appeals  to  the  contrary,  we  have  not  lifted  this\r\n\r\nrequirement,  and  I  hope  Mr Chiam will  support  us  in  that\r\n\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, my issue is that this is the real\r\n\r\nsituation. It has already happened and a big amount of loan  has\r\n\r\nbeen given out by the banks and, also, very likely many of these\r\n\r\nloans  would be recalled because there are house purchasers  who\r\n\r\nare  unable  to pay.  So my question is: is the Government  just\r\n\r\nstanding by and watching these many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npoor  purchasers having to go bankrupt?

I am sure the Association would not mind me  telling\r\n\r\nthe  Member  that,  in terms of housing loans,  what  they  have\r\n\r\nsuggested  to  the  banks is to consider not requiring  top  ups\r\n\r\nwhere  the term loan repayments are current, and to look  at  it\r\n\r\ncase  by  case and support customers who have viable businesses,\r\n\r\nand  help them to weather the current difficult environment.   I\r\n\r\nthink these are for banks to decide.  If the bank wants to  pull\r\n\r\nback  a loan because the customer is not servicing, and we  tell\r\n\r\nthe  bank, \"No\", do you take on the responsibility?   I  am  not\r\n\r\nprepared to take on the responsibility because I would  have  to\r\n\r\ncome  here  and ask Members to vote money which may  be  in  the\r\n\r\nbillions  of dollars, in the case of Japan, US$600 billion.   We\r\n\r\nshould  go  to the banks not to rescue a bank, but to make  sure\r\n\r\nthe  whole  banking  system does not  collapse,  and  the  whole\r\n\r\neconomy does not collapse.

Even if we need to stimulate\r\n\r\nthe  economy  by  $2 billion a year, the money would  be  better\r\n\r\nspent  in  helping  specific groups and  areas  rather  than  by\r\n\r\nlifting the GST across-the-board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PROPERTY TAX REBATE FOR COMMERCIAL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Extension to residential properties)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nwhether   (i)  the  property  tax  rebate  for  commercial   and\r\n\r\nindustrial  properties  announced  as  part  of  the  off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures  can  be extended to residential properties  since  the\r\n\r\nproperty tax of 12% applies to all properties with the exception\r\n\r\nof   owner-occupied  property;  and  (ii)  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nconsider  expediting  its  re-assessment  of  annual  values  of\r\n\r\nproperty in order to reflect significantly lower market prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the property tax\r\n\r\nrebate  is  intended  to ease the cost of  doing  businesses  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

In my Ministerial Statement on off-Budget  measures, I have given some details of the  key  sectors\r\n\r\nand  specific development projects for which the Government will\r\n\r\nrelease  an additional $670 million in FY98. This sum  comprises\r\n\r\n$460 million to speed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nup  existing  development projects or to start  new  ones,  $125\r\n\r\nmillion for assistance schemes for companies, and $83 million to\r\n\r\nincrease  civil service recruitment.  I will now  highlight  the\r\n\r\nmain  projects  which will receive substantial  disbursement  of\r\n\r\nfunds under the off-Budget package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional spending on education accounts for the largest\r\n\r\nshare of $282 million, or about 42% of total disbursement.  This\r\n\r\nincludes,  in  the  area  of  IT development,  $22  million  for\r\n\r\nenhancing  CAD-CAM facilities in the polytechnics,  $22  million\r\n\r\nfor  upgrading  computer facilities in NTU, and $30  million  to\r\n\r\nincorporate   IT   in  primary  and  secondary   schools   under\r\n\r\nconstruction.

The\r\n\r\nrecruitment of more teachers will cost $70 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional spending on economic infrastructure this year\r\n\r\nincludes  $50  million  to  assist  the  commercial  rollout  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  One,  $22 million to put in basic infrastructure  for\r\n\r\nindustrial land sales, $15 million to develop Chinatown  as  the\r\n\r\nfirst  Thematic Zone under the Tourism 21 Plan, and $13  million\r\n\r\nto further speed up the Jurong Island reclamation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sum of $31 million is set aside to put in place the\r\n\r\nnecessary  basic infrastructure in HDB new towns such  as  roads\r\n\r\nand  drains.  Some $36 million will be spent to speed up  public\r\n\r\nsector   computerisation  efforts  to  upgrade  the  operational\r\n\r\ncapabilities of our uniformed services in the Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.   In  addition,  another $13 million  is  allocated  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  more  officers  for our civil  defence  force,  police,\r\n\r\nprisons and immigration departments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional funds have also been allocated to help our\r\n\r\nworkers  and  companies tide over this difficult  period.   This\r\n\r\nincludes  an additional $80 million for the Economic Development\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme,  $20  million in interest  subsidy  for  the\r\n\r\nenhanced Local Enterprise Financing Scheme, or LEFS, $20 million\r\n\r\nfor the Skills Redevelopment Programme, and $5\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmillion  for TDB trade promotion and facilitation programmes  to\r\n\r\nhelp   our  retailers  and  companies  with  overseas  marketing\r\n\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second part of the question, the request is for\r\n\r\ninformation  on  the  CIDB's programmes.   The  registration  of\r\n\r\ncontractors by the Construction Industry Development Board is an\r\n\r\nintegral   part  of  the  Government's  tendering   process   to\r\n\r\nobjectively  evaluate a contractor's capability and capacity  to\r\n\r\ntake on projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past three years, local construction firms performed\r\n\r\nquite   well   clinching  about  63%  of  total  public   sector\r\n\r\nconstruction contracts in value terms, or 94% in terms of number\r\n\r\nof  projects.   There are more than twice the  number  of  local\r\n\r\ncontractors  compared to foreign contractors in the $50  million\r\n\r\nand  above registration category of G8. In the last year  alone,\r\n\r\nthe  number of local construction firms registered with CIDB had\r\n\r\nrisen  by  9%, from 1,361 to 1,485, with the number  in  the  G8\r\n\r\nclass increasing from 61 to 65.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, foreign contractors' competitive edge in large\r\n\r\nprojects stems not from just doing the construction work, but by\r\n\r\nbeing  able  to  provide  a  total solution  or  package,  which\r\n\r\nincludes  integrating  both design and  technological  know-how.\r\n\r\nThey  offer  alternatives  and win clients  over  with  superior\r\n\r\nsolutions, which save time and costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relaxing the registration criteria is not the solution to\r\n\r\nthe current problem.  It will not shift the competitive edge  of\r\n\r\nforeign contractors over our local contractors in tendering  for\r\n\r\nhigh value projects above $100 million where the local share  of\r\n\r\ncontracts awarded is significantly lower.  Instead, it will lead\r\n\r\nto  keener competition and cause more construction firms to  get\r\n\r\ninto  difficulties, which is not beneficial to the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry  at this time.  Besides this, relaxing the registration\r\n\r\nrequirement  could  compromise the objective  of  ensuring  that\r\n\r\nfirms  tendering for jobs of different sizes have  the  capacity\r\n\r\nand  capability to execute them satisfactorily.   The reputation\r\n\r\nand  credibility of the registration system as a  guide  to  the\r\n\r\nfirms' capacity and capability has been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npainstakingly built up over the years, and we should not  change\r\n\r\nthe criteria just to try and suit economic circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's suggestion to downsize large-scale projects as an alternative way to widen the opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  more  local contractors to tender for the projects,  CIDB's\r\n\r\nrecord shows that most of the above $100 million projects won by\r\n\r\nforeign  contractors were private sector projects.   The  public\r\n\r\nsector  projects  won by foreign contractors were  mainly  those\r\n\r\nwhere the capabilities lie with the foreign contractors, such as\r\n\r\nfor  the MRT line projects.  Downsizing projects would generally\r\n\r\nrequire  large contracts to be broken down into smaller parcels.\r\n\r\nApart from losing the economy of scale and lower prices achieved\r\n\r\nin  large contracts, the public sector agencies would also incur\r\n\r\nhigher  overheads to manage a larger number of smaller projects.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,  my Ministry will encourage public sector  agencies\r\n\r\nto study and consider such project downsizing where feasible and\r\n\r\nwhere  there is likely to be minimal impact on procurement  cost\r\n\r\nand administrative overheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND CONTRIBUTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Reduction and servicing of housing loan instalments)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if he\r\n\r\nwill  give assurance that there will be no reduction in  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund contribution during this financial  year  ending\r\n\r\n31st March 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nwhether  he  will elaborate on the measures that the  Government\r\n\r\nwill  take to ease the financial burden of the workers when  the\r\n\r\nemployer's CPF contribution rate is cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Manpower how\r\n\r\nmany   Central  Provident  Fund  Board  members  are   currently\r\n\r\nwithdrawing  funds to service monthly housing  loan  instalments\r\n\r\nand of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthese,  how  many  are currently withdrawing  funds  up  to  the\r\n\r\nmaximum allowable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr S Iswaran</b> asked the Minister for Manpower how many\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund (CPF) account holders will need to  seek\r\n\r\nother sources of funds to service their home mortgage loans when\r\n\r\nthere is a 5% or 10% reduction in the employer's contribution to\r\n\r\nCPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, Question Nos. 11, 12, 13 and 14 are\r\n\r\non  the  same subject.

Of these, 101,914 CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  (or  19.4%) are withdrawing the full  amount  of  their\r\n\r\nmonthly contributions to service mortgage repayments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have previously stated that the Government has no\r\n\r\nintention to cut the employer's share of CPF contributions  this\r\n\r\nyear.   I would like to reassure hon. Members that this is still\r\n\r\nthe  position.   However, if the situation continues  to  worsen\r\n\r\nnext  year,  we  may  have   to  consider  a  reduction  in  the\r\n\r\nemployer's CPF contribution rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of people who have to seek alternative source of\r\n\r\nfunds  to service their mortgage loans is not just dependent  on\r\n\r\nthe size of the CPF reduction.  It is also related to the amount\r\n\r\nof  savings  that  the CPF member already  has  in  his  or  her\r\n\r\nordinary  account.   Some  of  these  savings  can  be  used  to\r\n\r\nsupplement  the  monthly  contributions  to  meet  the  mortgage\r\n\r\nrepayment.   Furthermore, the distribution of a CPF cut  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinary, Special and Medisave Accounts will also  have  an\r\n\r\nimpact  on mortgage servicing by CPF members.  These are  issues\r\n\r\nwhich  will be carefully studied when it is necessary to make  a\r\n\r\nCPF cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When CPF contributions were cut in 1986, several assistance\r\n\r\nschemes were made available by the Government, in particular, to\r\n\r\nhelp home-owners with their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmortgage  repayments.   For those with HDB  housing  loans,  HDB\r\n\r\nextended the loan repayment period and allowed conversion of the\r\n\r\nloans  to  easy-payment schemes such as the  ballooning  scheme.\r\n\r\nThose  with  no  income or had used up their CPF balances  could\r\n\r\nalso  apply  to defer payments for up to a year.  The Government\r\n\r\nalso  offered bridging loans to those with private housing loans\r\n\r\nto  service.  These were given at a special rate of 0.1%   above\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  interest  rate.  Home-owners who took  bridging  loans\r\n\r\ncould  repay  either  in  cash  or  through  their  future   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  over  10  years.   Similar  assistance  will   be\r\n\r\nconsidered if we need to make a CPF cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister tell\r\n\r\nthe  House how many CPF members have sufficient funds to service\r\n\r\ntheir  mortgage  repayments if there is a CPF cut  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I explained in my\r\n\r\nanswer,  that would depend on how much we have to cut.  It  will\r\n\r\nalso depend on how much savings the individual CPF member has in\r\n\r\nhis  Ordinary Account, and it also depends on how we spread  the\r\n\r\ncut  on  the different accounts.  CPF members would, of  course,\r\n\r\nknow  that  whatever savings they have in their Special  Account\r\n\r\ncould not be used for any other purpose.  If, in fact, it  is  a\r\n\r\ncrisis  situation and we have to make a change,  we  could  even\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing  some of them to use part  of  their  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  savings.  These are all questions that have got  to  be\r\n\r\ncarefully  considered when we come to the point  of  considering\r\n\r\nsuch  a move.

This\r\n\r\nrequirement  will  also affect the cash flow  of  companies  and\r\n\r\nweaken  their  ability to seize new business opportunities.   To\r\n\r\nestablish such a Fund now when the economy is slowing down,  and\r\n\r\nmay  even  go  into recession, could hasten the demise  of  more\r\n\r\ncompanies.  So instead of doing good, it may end up causing more\r\n\r\nworkers to lose their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am therefore not in favour of the proposal to set up a\r\n\r\nCentral  Retrenchment Benefits Fund.  This,  however,  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  workers are not paid retrenchment benefit when  they\r\n\r\nare  laid  off.  In fact, retrenched workers with a  minimum  of\r\n\r\nthree  years'  service  are eligible for a retrenchment  benefit\r\n\r\nalthough the quantum of payment varies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom company to company and depends on the financial position of\r\n\r\neach  company.

Even if we have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  law  to  provide for retrenchment benefit to be paid  or  the\r\n\r\nquantum  is stated in the law, if a company has no assets,  then\r\n\r\nthere is nothing that can be done.  The company is bankrupt.  It\r\n\r\nhas no assets.  So there is no way that we can force the company\r\n\r\nto cough up retrenchment benefit for workers that are now out of\r\n\r\njob.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also said that the situation of some workers who\r\n\r\nare  retrenched  with little or no retrenchment benefit  is  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  Government not doing anything to protect  their\r\n\r\ninterest  in advance.  I think that is quite wrong, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir.   The  law  has provided for the employees with  more  than\r\n\r\nthree years' service to be eligible for retrenchment benefit and\r\n\r\nthe  trade unions have certainly acted on this provision because\r\n\r\nthey   have   ensured  that  in  their  collective   agreements,\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefit is clearly spelt out and the practice today\r\n\r\nin  the  unionised  sector  is for retrenchment  benefit  to  be\r\n\r\ncalculated anywhere from two weeks to a month for each  year  of\r\n\r\nservice.   Companies that are retrenching workers and are  still\r\n\r\nin  a  sound  financial  situation very often  comply  with  the\r\n\r\nprovision  for  retrenchment  benefit  within  their  collective\r\n\r\nagreements.  So it is incorrect to say  that the Government  has\r\n\r\nnot   looked  after  the  needs  of  workers  with   regard   to\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, whilst I appreciate the Minister's\r\n\r\nanswer  that  it  may  be wrong to burden  companies  with  more\r\n\r\npayments  at  this particular time, has the Ministry  considered\r\n\r\nsetting up a retrenchment fund and transferring some of the huge\r\n\r\namount  of  monies that the Government has collected by  way  of\r\n\r\nforeign worker levies, and the Ministers also giving up  a  part\r\n\r\nof their salaries to put into this retrenchment fund?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the foreign worker levy\r\n\r\nis  collected for a totally different purpose.  It is a means of\r\n\r\nmoderating  the  demand for foreign workers, in particular,  the\r\n\r\nlower skilled foreign workers.  As to Government setting up such\r\n\r\na  retrenchment  fund, whether it is from fees and  levies  that\r\n\r\nGovernment has collected from elsewhere\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  even  from  cuts  in  Ministers' salaries,  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nappropriate  for  me  to  point out  to  the  Member  that  such\r\n\r\nretrenchment  funds  set  up  elsewhere  have  very  often   not\r\n\r\ndelivered the results that they have been set up for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read to Members the assessment which was made by the\r\n\r\nJapan Institute of Labour.  This was carried by the Japan Labour\r\n\r\nBulletin  which was published in March this year.   This  is  on\r\n\r\ntheir  assessment  of  the national unemployment  benefits.   In\r\n\r\nJapan, since the early 80s, they have established  an employment\r\n\r\ninsurance scheme with the help of the government.  I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, since 1994, the scheme has been in the red due to\r\n\r\nthe   worsening  employment  situation  in  Japan.   Given  this\r\n\r\nsituation,  the  Central Employment Security  Council  has  been\r\n\r\nstudying ways to reduce the national treasury's contribution and\r\n\r\nto  revise the employment insurance scheme in order to  keep  up\r\n\r\nwith  changes in the industrial structure and the ageing of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo,  what  it says here is that a country, with Japan's economic\r\n\r\nresources  and trillions of dollars of reserves,  is  unable  to\r\n\r\nsustain a national employment insurance scheme in order  to  pay\r\n\r\nunemployment benefits to out-of-job workers.  Do you think  that\r\n\r\na  country  like Singapore, with the limited resources  that  we\r\n\r\nhave, would be in a position to do better?  The real solution is\r\n\r\nto ensure that we continue to achieve steady economic growth and\r\n\r\nthat  new  jobs will be created so that retrenched workers  have\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  to  take on these new  jobs.   And  where  the\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers are unable to fulfil the skill  requirements\r\n\r\nof  the  new  employers, then the Government  will  come  in  to\r\n\r\nprovide the necessary support, including funding, so that  these\r\n\r\nworkers' skills can be upgraded or they can be retrained to take\r\n\r\non these new jobs.  That is the only permanent and real solution\r\n\r\nto the problem of unemployment and retrenchment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PROLONGED AND STRUCTURAL UNEMPLOYMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower, in\r\n\r\nview of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncurrent  worsening economic situation, whether he  foresees  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of prolonged unemployment of up to a year  or  more\r\n\r\nfor older and unskilled workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nwhether Singapore will face structural unemployment in the  next\r\n\r\ntwo  to  three years and, if so, whether the current  policy  on\r\n\r\ntraining of workers is sufficient to cope with the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, Question Nos. 16 and 17 are also\r\n\r\nconnected.

Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, Members are aware that the Malaysian Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  announced  that their Customs, Immigration  and  Quarantine\r\n\r\n(CIQ)  facilities  will  remain at  the  Tanjong  Pagar  Railway\r\n\r\nStation,  even though Singapore had told them on many  occasions\r\n\r\nthat  they could not remain there after Singapore relocates  its\r\n\r\nCIQ  to the Woodlands Train Checkpoint (WTCP) tomorrow.  Members\r\n\r\nwould  have also read the press statement issued by the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Home  Affairs  yesterday evening, and  reported  in  today's\r\n\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at our last meeting on 29th June this year, I informed\r\n\r\nthis  House  that  Singapore's CIQ  at  Tanjong  Pagar  will  be\r\n\r\nrelocated to the new facilities at WTCP on 1st August  1998.   I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we  had first informed Malaysia of our intention  to\r\n\r\nmove  to  Woodlands  in  1989  and had  repeated  this  on  many\r\n\r\nsubsequent  occasions.  We told them that once  Singapore's  CIQ\r\n\r\nmoved to  Woodlands, the administrative arrangements for them to\r\n\r\nexercise CIQ functions at Tanjong Pagar would cease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that sitting on 29th June, I had also stressed that the\r\n\r\nrelocation of Singapore's CIQ to Woodlands and the cessation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  CIQ at Tanjong Pagar did not affect  the  status  of\r\n\r\nMalayan  Railway  Land,  which  is  subject  to  the  Points  of\r\n\r\nAgreement (POA).  Indeed, this issue of relocation of our CIQ is\r\n\r\ncompletely different and separate from the POA and the status of\r\n\r\nthe  Malayan Railway Land or the Tanjong Pagar Railway  Station.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry of Law's press statement of 8th July 1998 repeated\r\n\r\nthis position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Government's insistence to continue\r\n\r\nconducting  immigration clearance at Tanjong Pagar  has  serious\r\n\r\nconsequences.   They will be doing so without  legal  authority.\r\n\r\nIf  they  endorse  passports of rail passengers travelling  from\r\n\r\nSingapore to Malaysia, it would be unauthorised and contrary  to\r\n\r\nthe  proper sequence of immigration clearance.  Under  Singapore\r\n\r\nlaw, this would create irregularities in the passport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will therefore explain the full background of the CIQ\r\n\r\nissue, so that Members\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill   know   that   the  Singapore  Government   has   expended\r\n\r\nconsiderable effort and has made many proposals to  Malaysia  to\r\n\r\nresolve this issue, in a way which would not disrupt the  smooth\r\n\r\noperation   of   train   services   from   1st   August    1998.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Sir, these efforts have not been successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our decision to relocate Singapore's CIQ to the Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint was not a sudden or surprise move.  It goes  all  the\r\n\r\nway  back  to  1989,  when we decided on  our  move  of  CIQ  to\r\n\r\nWoodlands  in order to check the smuggling of drugs, to  prevent\r\n\r\nentry  of  illegal  immigrants as well  as  to  deploy  our  own\r\n\r\nmanpower  more  efficiently.  In November 1989, as  I  was  then\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home  Affairs,  I briefed  the  Malaysian  Deputy\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs, Dato Megat Junid, of our plan to move\r\n\r\nour  CIQ and the rationale for our decision.  Slightly more than\r\n\r\ntwo  years later, I wrote to him again on 1st  February 1992  to\r\n\r\ninform  him  that,  \"The  Development  masterplan  for  the  new\r\n\r\nWoodlands  Checkpoint, which includes clearance  facilities  for\r\n\r\ntrain passengers and cargoes, is now ready.\"  He replied on  3rd\r\n\r\nMarch 1992, and said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I have passed the information to the Hon. Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwho is also the Minister for Home Affairs Malaysia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, our two Prime Ministers touched on this matter in\r\n\r\ntheir correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  a letter of 4th April 1992, Prime Minister Mahathir wrote to\r\n\r\nPM Goh, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We understand why you would want to have Customs and\r\n\r\nImmigration checks at Woodlands.  In fact, we feel that it would\r\n\r\nbe   more  convenient  for  both  countries  to  have  the  same\r\n\r\ncheckpoint in Woodlands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9th April 1992, Prime Minister Goh replied to Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Mahathir, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This can be done. I have asked Jayakumar to include\r\n\r\nfacilities for Malaysia's customs and immigration at Woodlands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this agreement between the two Prime Ministers,\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Home Affairs briefed Malaysian officials in June\r\n\r\n1992 on the details of Singapore's plan to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrelocate its CIQ to the Woodlands Checkpoint.  We informed  them\r\n\r\nwhat  facilities could be made available to them if they  wished\r\n\r\nto co-locate their CIQ at Woodlands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on 20th September 1993, the Malaysian Government\r\n\r\nofficially informed Singapore that they had decided to co-locate\r\n\r\ntheir CIQ with Singapore's at Woodlands Train Checkpoint.  Dato'\r\n\r\nHalim  Ali,  then  Deputy Secretary-General 1 of  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, wrote to the Singapore Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHome Affairs, and he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I wish to inform you that the Malaysian Government has\r\n\r\ndecided to locate the operation of the Malaysian Immigration and\r\n\r\nCustoms  at  Woodlands Checkpoint together with  Singapore's  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  immigration and customs clearance of passengers  and\r\n\r\ngoods  entering and leaving Malaysia by rail through  Woodlands,\r\n\r\nSingapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore therefore proceeded to plan the construction\r\n\r\nof  the  Woodlands Train Checkpoint on the basis that Malaysia's\r\n\r\nCIQ  would  co-locate with Singapore's CIQ  at  Woodlands  Train\r\n\r\nCheckpoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost four years later, on 11th June 1997, the Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment wrote to the Ministry of Home Affairs stating that it\r\n\r\nhad  changed  its  mind and had decided to  retain  its  CIQ  at\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar.  The letter was signed by Dato Ghazzali  Sheikh,\r\n\r\nDeputy Secretary-General 1, of the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs.   It  gave no reasons, although considerable  work  had\r\n\r\nbeen  done  by  Singapore in planning and  construction  of  the\r\n\r\nWoodlands  Train Checkpoint on the basis of co-location.   After\r\n\r\nMalaysia  had  rejected co-location, Singapore then reconfigured\r\n\r\nthe   Woodlands   Train  Checkpoint  building  to   serve   only\r\n\r\nSingapore's needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2nd July 1997, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Singapore,\r\n\r\nreplied  to  the  Malaysian Government that since  Malaysia  had\r\n\r\nrejected  Singapore's offer to co-locate its CIQ  at  Woodlands,\r\n\r\nonce  Singapore's  CIQ moved to Woodlands their  CIQ  could  not\r\n\r\nremain at Tanjong Pagar because of two reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it will create serious operational problems for\r\n\r\nboth countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Malaysian officials would be operating without\r\n\r\nthe  presence of Singapore officials to lend their authority and\r\n\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note from what I have said that Malaysia had\r\n\r\nbeen  given notice more than a year ago that once we  moved  our\r\n\r\nCIQ,  their CIQ could not stay in Tanjong Pagar.  Since Malaysia\r\n\r\nhad  rejected Woodlands and we had told them that they could not\r\n\r\nstay in Tanjong Pagar, this meant they had to relocate their CIQ\r\n\r\nto their own territory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd February 1998, Singapore officials informed\r\n\r\nKeretapi  Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) at a meeting that Singapore\r\n\r\nagencies  would operate at Woodlands  Train Checkpoint from  1st\r\n\r\nAugust  1998.   KTMB was also requested to be ready  to  operate\r\n\r\nfrom  there  on  1st  August 1998.  On  25th  March  1998,  KTMB\r\n\r\nconfirmed,  and I quote, \"as far as KTMB was concerned,  it  was\r\n\r\nworking towards 1st August 1998 to be operationally ready.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 24th April 1998, Ministry of Home Affairs, Singapore,\r\n\r\nofficially  wrote  to  Dato Ghazzali  Sheikh  of  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Foreign Affairs to inform the Malaysian  Government\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore would commence its CIQ operations  in  Woodlands\r\n\r\nfrom 1st August 1998.  In its letter, MHA stated, \"In accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  letter  of  2nd July 1997, (previous  year's  letter)\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  requested  to cease its  Immigration  and  Customs\r\n\r\nclearance of rail passengers and rail cargo at the Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nRailway  Station  by 1st August 1998.  Malaysia should  relocate\r\n\r\nits rail CIQ operations within its own territory.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14th May 1998, Malaysian officials met with their\r\n\r\nSingapore counterparts to discuss the matter.  At this  meeting,\r\n\r\nDato  Ghazzali Sheikh asked Deputy Secretary of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs,  Mr  Tan Boon Huat, whether  the  option  of  co-location at Woodlands Train Checkpoint was still open.   Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nreiterated that since Malaysia had rejected co-location in their\r\n\r\nletter of 2nd July 1997, the offer had lapsed.  Furthermore, the\r\n\r\nWoodlands Checkpoint had since been built without provision  for\r\n\r\nMalaysian CIQ facilities.  Mr\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTan  also  explained that Malaysia would have to  move  its  CIQ\r\n\r\nfacilities  out of Tanjong Pagar Railway Station by  1st  August\r\n\r\n1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10th July 1998, at Malaysia's request, officials from\r\n\r\nboth  sides  met in Singapore.  At this meeting, the  Malaysians\r\n\r\nclaimed  for the first time that Malaysia had a legal  right  to\r\n\r\nretain    their   customs   at   Tanjong   Pagar.    Singapore's\r\n\r\nrepresentative  from the Attorney-General's  Chambers  disagreed\r\n\r\nwith   this   legal  claim.   For  Malaysian  Immigration,   the\r\n\r\nMalaysians  conceded that there was no enabling  legislation  to\r\n\r\nallow them to operate in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore officials stressed that Malaysia's CIQ could not\r\n\r\nremain at  Tanjong Pagar because there was no legal basis for it\r\n\r\nto  do  so.   Moreover, this would pose operational difficulties\r\n\r\nand  result  in  an  illogical sequence of passenger  clearance,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not in accordance with international practice.   This\r\n\r\nimproper  sequence  of clearance would cause problems  in  crime\r\n\r\ninvestigation  and  prosecution and also raise  difficult  legal\r\n\r\nissues  of  proof.  Singapore informed the Malaysians that  they\r\n\r\nhad to move their CIQ to Johor Baru.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian officials did not dispute that the sequence\r\n\r\nof  immigration clearance would be illogical if its  immigration\r\n\r\noperations  remained at Tanjong Pagar when  Singapore  moved  to\r\n\r\nWoodlands.    However,   they  proposed  that   Malaysia   grant\r\n\r\nconditional  immigration clearance in advance at  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nwhich  would not be valid until followed up by a final clearance\r\n\r\nby  Singapore Immigration at Woodlands.  Singapore informed them\r\n\r\nthat this suggestion for advance clearance was not practical, as\r\n\r\nit would not resolve and address the basic issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both sides met again on 17th July 1998. Since Malaysia\r\n\r\nclaimed  a  legal right for their Customs to remain  at  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  but  Singapore  did  not  agree  with  their  claim,  we\r\n\r\nrequested  Malaysia to forward detailed written legal  arguments\r\n\r\nwithin three months for further study by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore's Attorney-General.  Officials from the two  Attorney-Generals' Chambers would then meet to clarify the legal position\r\n\r\non the basis of which Malaysia claimed that it has a legal right\r\n\r\nfor  its  Customs  to continue operating in  Singapore.   As  an\r\n\r\ninterim  arrangement,  Singapore would allow  Malaysian  customs\r\n\r\nofficers  to  operate at Tanjong Pagar Railway Station,  and  we\r\n\r\nwould  station  Singapore  officials at  Tanjong  Pagar  Railway\r\n\r\nStation to lend their authority to Malaysian customs officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards immigration, Malaysia now also argued that\r\n\r\ndespite  the  absence  of  any specific  legislation,  Malaysian\r\n\r\nImmigration  had  a  legal  basis to operate  at  Tanjong  Pagar\r\n\r\nRailway  Station,  on  the  basis  of  acquiescence  and   state\r\n\r\npractice, which was backed by international law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore disagreed. For Malaysia to locate its\r\n\r\nimmigration  control  post  in  Singapore  is  actually  not  in\r\n\r\ncompliance with Malaysia's own law.  Under Malaysian law,  Johor\r\n\r\nBahru  railway  station is gazetted as the  immigration  control\r\n\r\npost for persons travelling from Singapore to Malaysia by train,\r\n\r\nand  not Tanjong Pagar Railway Station.  Indeed, they could  not\r\n\r\ngazette  Tanjong  Pagar Railway Station as it  is  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nterritory.   In  fact, this is confirmed by the  endorsement  or\r\n\r\nchop  on  passports of passengers boarding the train at  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar,  which  clearly  states that  the  Malaysian  Immigration\r\n\r\nControl Point is in Johor Bahru.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, Singapore agreed that Malaysia could make its\r\n\r\ncase  on immigration arrangements in the written arguments  that\r\n\r\nit had agreed to present within three months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after claiming the right under law to have their CIQ\r\n\r\nremain  in Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, Malaysia said  at  the\r\n\r\n10th and 17th July 1998 meetings that they would now like to co-locate  with  Singapore at the Woodlands Checkpoint.   Singapore\r\n\r\ndid  not  agree.  We explained that when Malaysia  rejected  co-location  last year on 11th June 1997, Singapore had decided  on\r\n\r\nphysical arrangements that made no provision for Malaysia's CIQ.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we decided that it was best\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat   the   respective  CIQ  arrangements  be  regularised   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with international practice by each  country  having\r\n\r\nits  own  CIQ in its own territory as is the case for road,  air\r\n\r\nand sea transport and travel between Singapore and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We informed Malaysia at the meeting of 17th July 1998 that\r\n\r\nif it needed more time to relocate its immigration operations to\r\n\r\nJohor  Bahru, Singapore would, as an interim arrangement,  allow\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Immigration  to board outgoing  trains  at  Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint and clear passengers onboard the train after they had\r\n\r\nbeen cleared for exit from Singapore.  Our officials also handed\r\n\r\nover an Aide Memoire explaining this to the Malaysian delegation\r\n\r\nat the meeting.  The Malaysians rejected the option of clearance\r\n\r\non  the  train.  However, Datuk Abdul Kadir Mohamad,  Secretary-General  of the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requested\r\n\r\nfor   some  desks  on  the  Woodlands  Checkpoint  platform  for\r\n\r\nMalaysian  immigration clearance.  Our officials did not  accede\r\n\r\nto his request.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after that meeting on 17th July 1998, Datuk\r\n\r\nKadir  told  my  Permanent Secretary BG  Tan  Chin  Tiong  in  a\r\n\r\ntelephone  conversation that it was not practical for  Malaysian\r\n\r\nImmigration officials to conduct checks onboard the  trains,  as\r\n\r\nit  would mean reducing KTMB's current train schedules by  half.\r\n\r\nBased on our own calculations and experience, this was not true.\r\n\r\nHowever,   I  wanted  to  resolve  this  issue.   Therefore,   I\r\n\r\nauthorised  my  Permanent Secretary to  tell  Datuk  Kadir  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  had agreed to his request for desks at the  Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint   passenger   platform  for   Malaysian   Immigration\r\n\r\nclearance,  as  an  interim  arrangement.   BG  Tan  Chin  Tiong\r\n\r\nconveyed  this  by telephone to Datuk Kadir on 19th  July  1998.\r\n\r\nDatuk  Kadir replied that it was good that Singapore had offered\r\n\r\nto  allow Malaysia a few desks for its immigration clearance  at\r\n\r\nWoodlands as this would make Malaysian Immigration more orderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was clear that we had settled on interim\r\n\r\narrangements  for both customs and immigration.   Singapore  had\r\n\r\ngone to considerable lengths to do so.  On 24th\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nJuly  1998, Singapore's Acting High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur\r\n\r\nhanded over an Aide Memoire and press statement to the Malaysian\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Foreign Affairs, placing on record  these  interim\r\n\r\narrangements which had been discussed and settled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\nissued  a press statement, claiming factual inaccuracies in  the\r\n\r\nMHA press statement, and denying that Malaysia had agreed on the\r\n\r\ninterim  arrangements described by Singapore.  It denied  asking\r\n\r\nfor  desks  on  the Woodlands Checkpoint passenger platform  for\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Immigration.  It claimed that Malaysia had  requested\r\n\r\nfor  space  inside the Woodlands Checkpoint building.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nthe  Undersecretary (Southeast Asia and South  Pacific)  at  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr Arshad  Hussain,  was\r\n\r\nquoted in Bernama as saying:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"All we are asking for is co-location inside the Woodlands\r\n\r\nTrain checkpoint as [in] the original plan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25th July 1998, MHA issued a press statement expressing\r\n\r\npuzzlement and surprise that Malaysia had disputed the MHA press\r\n\r\nstatement  of 24th July 1998.  In the statement, MHA  said  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  had  worked  on  the basis  that  both  Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  wanted smooth train operations when  Singapore  moves\r\n\r\nits  CIQ  to Woodlands Checkpoint on 1st August 1998.  That  was\r\n\r\nwhy  Singapore had responded positively to Datuk Kadir's request\r\n\r\nfor   a  few  desks  on  the  passenger  platform  at  Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint  for  Malaysian  immigration  clearance.    Singapore\r\n\r\ntherefore did not understand why Malaysia now claimed that there\r\n\r\nwas  no agreement on interim arrangements for Malaysia's CIQ  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I subsequently met Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah\r\n\r\nBadawi  during the 31st ASEAN Ministerial Meeting in  Manila  on\r\n\r\n25th July 1998.  Minister Badawi and I had worked closely before\r\n\r\nwhenever  we had bilateral problems.  He requested a meeting  to\r\n\r\nsee if we could resolve the impasse.  Minister Abdullah Badawi's\r\n\r\nmain  concern  was  that  the interim  arrangements  offered  to\r\n\r\nMalaysian Immigration should be \"functional and presentable\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHe agreed with me that Malaysian Immigration could not remain at\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  after 31st July 1998, because  the  sequence  of\r\n\r\nimmigration  clearance  would  be  illogical  and  contrary   to\r\n\r\ninternational practice.  He also agreed that there would  be  no\r\n\r\nco-location  of Malaysian Immigration with Singapore Immigration\r\n\r\ninside the building at Woodlands Checkpoint.  On this basis,  we\r\n\r\nagreed  to instruct our immigration officials to meet  again  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as possible to work out interim arrangements for Malaysian\r\n\r\nImmigration  at Woodlands Checkpoint which would  be  functional\r\n\r\nand  presentable.  Following my meeting with Minister Badawi,  I\r\n\r\nissued a short press statement summarising these agreed points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore immediately followed up by inviting Malaysian\r\n\r\nImmigration  officials to a meeting in Singapore  on  28th  July\r\n\r\n1998.   The  Malaysian officials agreed to come  down  for  this\r\n\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the evening before the scheduled meeting, Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Mahathir  who  was  then in  Namibia,  was  quoted  in\r\n\r\nBernama, saying that Malaysia would not shift its CIQ facilities\r\n\r\nin  Singapore from Tanjong Pagar to Woodlands.  He was  reported\r\n\r\nto have said to accompanying Malaysian journalists, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\"That's our stand and we will stick to it.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malaysian delegation which attended the meeting on\r\n\r\n28th  July 1998 did not do so with an open mind to resolve  this\r\n\r\nissue conclusively.   The talks broke down because the Malaysian\r\n\r\nofficials insisted that Malaysian Immigration should be  located\r\n\r\nwithin  our  Woodlands Checkpoint building, notwithstanding  the\r\n\r\nunderstanding  between Minister Abdullah Badawi  and  myself  in\r\n\r\nManila.    The   officials   said  that   otherwise,   Malaysian\r\n\r\nImmigration would remain at Tanjong Pagar.  Singapore  officials\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  assured  them that functional and  very  presentable\r\n\r\ninterim  arrangements would be set up for Malaysian  Immigration\r\n\r\nat  the  Woodlands  Checkpoint.  But  the  Malaysian  delegation\r\n\r\nrefused to consider them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, Singapore even proposed that the immigration\r\n\r\nbooths  on  the platform could be air-conditioned to  make  them\r\n\r\nmore comfortable.  The facilities would be even more presentable\r\n\r\nand  functional than those at the Tanjong Pagar  platform.   The\r\n\r\nWoodlands  Checkpoint  platform is 10 metres  wide,  wider  than\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  which  is  only 8 metres,  but  which  currently\r\n\r\naccommodates both Malaysian and Singapore Immigration  clearance\r\n\r\nfacilities  without difficulty at Tanjong Pagar.  The  Malaysian\r\n\r\ndelegation, however, insisted that this was unsatisfactory,  but\r\n\r\ngave  no reasons for this even though they are already operating\r\n\r\non the platform at Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore delegation reminded the Malaysians that if\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  Immigration  remained  at  Tanjong  Pagar  after\r\n\r\nSingapore Immigration moves to the Woodlands Checkpoint  on  1st\r\n\r\nAugust  1998,  the  sequence of immigration clearance  for  rail\r\n\r\npassengers  departing Singapore would be illogical and  contrary\r\n\r\nto international practice.  Malaysian Immigration would cease to\r\n\r\nhave  any  authority to clear immigration at Tanjong Pagar  once\r\n\r\nSingapore Immigration is no longer at Tanjong Pagar to lend them\r\n\r\ntheir authority.  The Malaysian delegation, however, refused  to\r\n\r\nconsider our position.  Instead they abruptly ended the  meeting\r\n\r\nand left.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, let me sum up by expressing my regret\r\n\r\nthat  the extended discussions with Malaysia to work out interim\r\n\r\narrangements for the Malaysian CIQ have broken down.  As Members\r\n\r\ncan  see, Singapore had gone to considerable lengths and made  a\r\n\r\nseries  of  proposals  and compromises  to  resolve  the  issue.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Malaysia  has changed its position  again  and  again.\r\n\r\nFirst,  in1993  they said they wanted to co-locate  with  us  in\r\n\r\nWoodlands.   Then  in  1997 they abruptly  changed  their  mind,\r\n\r\nrejected co-location and said they would stay in Tanjong  Pagar.\r\n\r\nThen in talks between officials this year, they claimed they had\r\n\r\na  legal  right  for their CIQ to stay in Tanjong  Pagar.   Then\r\n\r\nafter  claiming  this legal right to be at Tanjong  Pagar,  they\r\n\r\nsaid that they wanted to go back to the \"original plan\" to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nco-locate  at Woodlands.  Then finally, Prime Minister  Mahathir\r\n\r\nsaid they would stay in Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note that we have been consistent and tried to\r\n\r\nbe  reasonable  and helpful at every stage of our dealings  with\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysians  on  this issue and we have made  the  following\r\n\r\nconcessions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, after they rejected co-location, our position was\r\n\r\nthat their CIQ should be located in Malaysian territory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They then claimed legal rights to stay at Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\nWe  were  prepared  to hear their legal arguments,  and  pending\r\n\r\nresolution   of  the  legal  issue  we  agreed  as  an   interim\r\n\r\narrangement to let their Customs operate temporarily at  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  and  we would post our officers there to lend them  legal\r\n\r\nauthority\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clearance by their Immigration, when they\r\n\r\nrefused to relocate to Johor Bahru and claimed a legal right  to\r\n\r\noperate  in  Singapore,  we offered to allow  their  Immigration\r\n\r\nofficers  to  board  trains at Woodlands  Checkpoint  and  clear\r\n\r\npassengers on the trains en route to Johor Bahru, as an  interim\r\n\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Malaysia argued that this did not give Malaysian\r\n\r\nImmigration  enough  time to clear all  passengers,  we  offered\r\n\r\nMalaysian Immigration the option of clearing passengers on board\r\n\r\nstationary  trains at Woodlands Checkpoint but  after  Singapore\r\n\r\nhad cleared passengers for exit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia said this was unorderly, might upset train\r\n\r\nschedules,  and  asked  for  desks on the  Woodlands  Checkpoint\r\n\r\nplatform.  We agreed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They then expressed the concern that the desks were not\r\n\r\npresentable.   So we offered to assist Malaysian Immigration  by\r\n\r\nsetting  up  airconditioned booths at the Woodlands  Checkpoint.\r\n\r\nBut at the final meeting on 28th July, they insisted on location\r\n\r\ninside the main building, otherwise they would remain at Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, our High Commissioner in Malaysia presented\r\n\r\nan Aide Memoire to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian  Foreign Ministry in Kuala Lumpur  stated,  inter\r\n\r\nalia, the following, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Rail passengers will face following difficulties if\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Immigration  insists on  executing  their  duties  at\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar Railway Station after 31st July 1998 without  any\r\n\r\nlegal authority:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Malaysian Immigration officers performing immigration\r\n\r\nfunctions  at  Tanjong Pagar will be acting  without  any  legal\r\n\r\nauthority.  All endorsements made by them on Singapore passports\r\n\r\nwill  be unauthorised and improper.  The sequence of immigration\r\n\r\nclearance  will  also  be  contrary to  international  practice.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,  questions of serious irregularity in the  passport\r\n\r\nwill arise under Singapore law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) As the sequence of immigration clearance is illogical\r\n\r\nand   contrary  to  international  practice,  foreign   national\r\n\r\npassengers  exiting  from Singapore with such  unauthorised  and\r\n\r\nimproper  endorsements on their passports may face  difficulties\r\n\r\nat Singapore Immigration checkpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTravellers who enter Singapore by rail from Johor Bahru will not\r\n\r\nbe   affected  as  they  are  following  the  correct  order  of\r\n\r\nimmigration clearance, exit granted by Malaysian Immigration  in\r\n\r\nJohor and entry granted by Singapore Immigration in Woodlands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysian Immigration's insistence to clear entry into\r\n\r\nMalaysia at Tanjong Pagar railway station after 31st July before\r\n\r\nSingapore  has cleared them for exit from Singapore  will  cause\r\n\r\ninconvenience to rail passengers.  The interim arrangements that\r\n\r\nSingapore  had offered for Malaysian Immigration in  Singapore's\r\n\r\nAide  Memoire  of  24th  July 1998 after discussions  with  both\r\n\r\nForeign   Ministers   in  Manila  would   have   avoided   this.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Malaysian officials have rejected  these  interim\r\n\r\narrangements and abruptly ended the 28th July 1998 meeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Malaysia has not informed Singapore exactly how it\r\n\r\nintends  to  proceed  after  31st  July  1998,  after  rejecting\r\n\r\nSingapore's proposal of airconditioned counters on the Woodlands\r\n\r\nTrain  Checkpoint  and  insisting that  their  Immigration  will\r\n\r\nconduct  clearance at Tanjong Pagar.  Singapore regrets that  it\r\n\r\nhas  to issue a travel advisory to inform rail passengers of the\r\n\r\ninconvenience   and  difficulties  that  they   will   face   if\r\n\r\nImmigration officials persist in granting passengers entry  into\r\n\r\nMalaysia at Tanjong Pagar before Singapore clears them for  exit\r\n\r\nat Woodlands.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems that the\r\n\r\ncontinued positioning of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMalaysian Immigration officials at Tanjong Pagar is going to  be\r\n\r\na legal and sovereign issue.

In other\r\n\r\nwords,  if the Malaysians should vacate Tanjong Pagar, Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  use  that  as an excuse to take over the land  at  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question is, operationally, as from tomorrow, when\r\n\r\npassengers  board  at  Tanjong Pagar  and  reach  our  Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint, what action would the Minister take in view  of  the\r\n\r\nfact that their passports would now not be regularised?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister whether the far-fetched Malaysian legal\r\n\r\nposition  and  claims would in fact mean that it is  undermining\r\n\r\nour  own  sovereignty as a country and that the  Malaysians  are\r\n\r\ntaking for granted our goodwill and patience on this matter.

While  these\r\n\r\ntalks  are  going on and they realise that the talks  may  break\r\n\r\ndown,  have  they made any preparation on their CIQ arrangements\r\n\r\nor  use  their own platform within their own territory  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  cater  for  an  alternative in  case  co-location  in\r\n\r\nSingapore cannot be agreed upon?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, Sir, is whether there has been any\r\n\r\nrequest from the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMalaysians,  since  the  talks have been  reaching  a  difficult\r\n\r\nstage, asking for deferment on our part on the implementation of\r\n\r\nthe movement of CIQ from tomorrow.  And if Singapore were to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  this  request, will it be possible for us to accommodate,\r\n\r\ngiven  that  we  already  have plans to  move  our  own  CIQ  to\r\n\r\nWoodlands?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, in today's Straits\r\n\r\nTimes,  it  is  reported  that,  \"Singapore  should  not  decide\r\n\r\nunilaterally  on the relocation of CIQ facilities  from  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  to  Woodlands.\"  It was mentioned by UMNO Vice-President,\r\n\r\nDato  Sri  Najib Tun Razak.

This  cannot  be right because  if  Ministers  and\r\n\r\nsenior   civil  servants  cannot  bind  their  own  country   to\r\n\r\nagreements signed by them, the question is how, in international\r\n\r\nlaw,  should binding agreements be signed.

Is this correct, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nunderstand why Malaysia claims that they have a right to stay in\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar as the piece of land belongs to them.   If  their\r\n\r\nargument is correct, it means that if Singapore Government  owns\r\n\r\na  piece  of land in Johor Bahru, we can move our CIQ  to  Johor\r\n\r\nBahru too.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether it is necessary for the Government to  gazette\r\n\r\nthe  Woodlands  Train  Checkpoint as  mandatory  for  all  train\r\n\r\npassengers to clear their immigration at that point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, two issues. One is regarding non-Malaysians entering\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore by train.  Basically, what it means is that they  will\r\n\r\nbe  entering  Singapore  illegally  since  they  have  not  left\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   So  the  travel advisory is for Singapore  citizens.\r\n\r\nHow   do   we  advise  foreigners  who  are  entering  Singapore\r\n\r\nillegally?  The second issue is that he mentioned that  the  CIQ\r\n\r\nfacilities in Tanjong Pagar would be illegal from tomorrow.   So\r\n\r\nwill we have any enforcement action to stop them from performing\r\n\r\ntheir  duties?   Are  we going to arrest them  for  doing  their\r\n\r\nduties illegally in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, several questions were asked. Let\r\n\r\nme  answer  them, perhaps not in the order that  was  asked.   I\r\n\r\nthink  Prof.  Chin  Tet Yung and one other MP  asked  about  the\r\n\r\nstatus  of  the land, whether it is their land and  what  rights\r\n\r\nensue from it.  And I believe Mr Jeyaretnam also asked about the\r\n\r\ntitle.   I am advised by the Attorney-General that Malaysia  has\r\n\r\nthe  legal  title  to the railway land.  It operates  a  railway\r\n\r\nservice on the land through KTM.  Under the terms of the leases,\r\n\r\nthe  railway  land is not intended to be used as a CIQ  station.\r\n\r\nMalaysia in fact does not claim and has no sovereignty over  the\r\n\r\nrailway land.  It has legal title to the land in the same way as\r\n\r\nan   individual   has  title  to  a  land.   However,   customs,\r\n\r\nimmigration and quarantine functions are State functions  which,\r\n\r\nunder international practice, have to be carried out only  by  a\r\n\r\nState in the territory where it has sovereignty.  One State  may\r\n\r\nnot  carry out such functions in the territory of another  State\r\n\r\nwithout  the consent of the latter as it infringes the sovereign\r\n\r\nrights of the State, and I believe, two Members, Mr Rai and  Low\r\n\r\nThia Khiang, alluded to that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction between railway operations on the one hand\r\n\r\nand  CIQ  functions  is  that the railway  function  is  not  an\r\n\r\nessential  or  inherent State function.  It  is  a  facilitative\r\n\r\nservice.  It is not an intrusive function.  CIQ functions are by\r\n\r\ntheir very nature State functions which can only be carried  out\r\n\r\nin  the territory in which the State has sovereign rights or  in\r\n\r\nthe  territory of another State if it is done by the consent  of\r\n\r\nthe latter.  To argue that Malaysia may perform CIQ functions at\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar railway station because it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovides  a  railway service is actually like arguing  that  any\r\n\r\ninternational  airline is entitled to perform CIQ operations  at\r\n\r\nany  international airport other than its own home port, because\r\n\r\nit provides an airline service.  Obviously, this cannot be so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Chng Hee Kok asked whether this is\r\n\r\nan  attempt  on Singapore's part to force them to  move  out  of\r\n\r\ntheir Tanjong Pagar station and for the Singapore Government  to\r\n\r\ntake  back the land.  My answer to that is that it is completely\r\n\r\nincorrect.   This  is because, as I have said in  Parliament  on\r\n\r\nseveral occasions, last year as well as again this year on  29th\r\n\r\nJune, the CIQ issue does not in any way affect the status of the\r\n\r\nMalayan  Railway  land or the status of their  railway  station.\r\n\r\nThese  matters  are  subject to the Points of  Agreement  (POA).\r\n\r\nThis  was also reiterated in the Ministry of Law's statement  of\r\n\r\n8th  July  when the Ministry of Law stressed that the relocation\r\n\r\nof  Malaysian CIQ operations from Tanjong Pagar is a  completely\r\n\r\ndifferent and separate issue from the POA, and separate from the\r\n\r\nstatus  of the Malayan Railway land in Singapore or the  railway\r\n\r\nstation  in Tanjong Pagar.  What happens to the railway land  at\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar  is set out in the POA which I went  into  detail\r\n\r\nlast year in this House.  The POA sets out the agreement for the\r\n\r\nredevelopment of Tanjong Pagar land on a 60:40 basis, 60% to the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  government.   The terms of  the  POA  bind  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is a binding agreement.  On the 17th  July  meeting\r\n\r\nbetween  the  officials, in fact, the Malaysian  officials  told\r\n\r\nSingapore that they understood clearly that the CIQ and the  POA\r\n\r\nare  different issues.  Therefore, because the CIQ  issue  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  different matter, there is no question of Singapore taking\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar land back as that matter is covered by the POA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have asked: why do we not take action to\r\n\r\nprevent  the Malaysian immigration from being physically present\r\n\r\nat  Tanjong Pagar?  I think Members will note that we have taken\r\n\r\na  reasonable and consistent approach to this matter.  They have\r\n\r\nclaimed a legal right for both customs and immigration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOn immigration, there is no specific enabling legislation.  They\r\n\r\nclaim  that  they have a right based on acquiescence  backed  by\r\n\r\ninternational  law.  We have said that we will give  them  three\r\n\r\nmonths  to  present  their  legal  arguments,  and  we  have  no\r\n\r\nobjection to them being physically present at Tanjong Pagar, but\r\n\r\nthe important point is this.  Even if they can establish such  a\r\n\r\nlegal right which we dispute, it does not follow that they  have\r\n\r\na right to clear people for entry into Malaysia at Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nbefore  such  people  have been properly  cleared  by  Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration for exit from Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked about the question of locating\r\n\r\noutside  the platform, inside the building, and so on.   Let  me\r\n\r\nanswer  by saying, first, that they had rejected co-location  in\r\n\r\n1997.  After they rejected co-location in 1997, MHA reconfigured\r\n\r\nit  for Singapore's own use.  But while we sort out their  legal\r\n\r\nclaim,  what  we  really want to put in  place  are  interim  or\r\n\r\ntemporary facilities to ensure smooth functioning on 1st August.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, as I said, the facilities we are prepared to cater  on\r\n\r\nthe  platform  will be far more presentable and functional  than\r\n\r\nwhat  they  have  at Tanjong Pagar station.  In  fact,  we  even\r\n\r\nsuggested to them that there could be air-conditioned booths  on\r\n\r\nthe  platform.  But why not inside our building?  Apart from  it\r\n\r\nbeing  configured for our own use only, the fact  is  that  they\r\n\r\nhave  changed their minds so often on the CIQ issue, how can  we\r\n\r\nbe  sure that once they are inside, they would not claim that we\r\n\r\nhave   agreed  to  co-location  and  claim  the  right  to  stay\r\n\r\npermanently.   We,  therefore,  think  that  it  is  best   that\r\n\r\nMalaysian immigration be at the platform at Woodlands Checkpoint\r\n\r\nso   that   there  can  be  no  doubt  that  these  are  interim\r\n\r\narrangements for three months during which they must  show  that\r\n\r\nthey  have a legal right to be at Tanjong Pagar.  Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nis  best  for both sides to avoid such misunderstanding and  any\r\n\r\nfuture  new problems by their moving inside Woodlands Checkpoint\r\n\r\nand  not moving out later, claiming that this has become a legal\r\n\r\nright,  as  they claim that they have a legal right  to  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions were asked: why can they not shift to Johor\r\n\r\nBahru?   What  are the insurmountable obstacles?  I  think  this\r\n\r\nquestion  should actually be asked of the Malaysians.   We  have\r\n\r\nasked  the  Malaysians.  We have not got any answer because  the\r\n\r\nstation  is  there.  They are using the station for checking  of\r\n\r\nincoming passengers.  Yesterday's press statement and as I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  today,  in fact, Johor Bahru railway station  is  gazetted\r\n\r\nunder  their  law  as  the  control  post  for  immigration  for\r\n\r\npassengers going to Johor Bahru.  It is under their law.   So  I\r\n\r\nam afraid I am unable to give an answer to that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has there been any request to defer the implementation from\r\n\r\n1st August?  There has not been such a request.  But how will it\r\n\r\nbe  possible  for us to consider such a deferment when  we  have\r\n\r\ngiven them such ample notice?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has hit the nail on the head when he\r\n\r\nasked  that  as a sovereign nation, why can they not operate  in\r\n\r\nJohor  Bahru.  Somebody else asked whether is it not a violation\r\n\r\nof  sovereignty  to  insist to operate  in  Singapore.   I  have\r\n\r\nanswered the question when I spoke about the nature of the land.\r\n\r\nThe  basic principle is: these are State functions which, if you\r\n\r\ninsist  on  exercising in the territory of another  country,  it\r\n\r\nmust be on the basis of consent.  That is the cardinal principle\r\n\r\nin international practice and in international law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat asked about agreements being ratified and\r\n\r\nso  on.   I  think he is referring to the Points  of  Agreement,\r\n\r\nwhether  the statement that agreements are not agreements  until\r\n\r\nand  unless  they have been ratified by Cabinet and  Parliament.\r\n\r\nOr did I misunderstand him?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Malaysians\r\n\r\nrefer  both  to  the  Points of Agreement and  the  exchange  of\r\n\r\nletters   between  the  Secretary-General  and   the   Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary that they do not count.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> It is not altogether clear to us when the\r\n\r\nstatement  was made that agreements and documents signed,  other\r\n\r\nthan  by Heads of States, are not binding, it is not clear  that\r\n\r\nreference is to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagreements  other than the POA.  But whatever the case  may  be,\r\n\r\nthese  are questions of law and there is a proper way to resolve\r\n\r\nthese  issues.   As  Members know, despite our initial  position\r\n\r\nthat  they  must move, when they claim a legal right,  we  said,\r\n\r\n\"All  right, let us sit down, exchange the legal arguments, sort\r\n\r\nout between the two Attorneys-General\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the POA, I have already said in Parliament on a previous\r\n\r\noccasion that there is a divergence of legal views on this.  The\r\n\r\nMalaysians  have taken the view that the POA is  operative  when\r\n\r\nthey  decide  that they wish to vacate Tanjong Pagar.   We  have\r\n\r\ntaken  the view, and we think we are right in law, that the  POA\r\n\r\nbecame  operational on the day it was signed by the  then  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Lee Kuan Yew on behalf of the Singapore Government  and\r\n\r\nFinance Minister, Mr Daim Zainudin, signing clearly on behalf of\r\n\r\nthe  Government of Malaysia.  But since there is this divergence\r\n\r\nof view, we have proposed that this legal dispute be referred to\r\n\r\narbitration  or the International Court of Justice, and  Members\r\n\r\nwould  have read that the come back to that is that there is  no\r\n\r\nneed to go to the International Court of Justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not\r\n\r\nanswered  my  question  on how the Malaysians  were  allowed  to\r\n\r\noperate at Tanjong Pagar in the first place.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> The short answer to that is that this goes\r\n\r\nback  to some years back.  We allowed them to operate when  they\r\n\r\nmade  a  request, but there is one very significant point  which\r\n\r\nall  of us must know, that when we allowed them to operate,  our\r\n\r\nauthorities were present at Tanjong Pagar.  In other  words,  we\r\n\r\nlent  them legal authority.  We allowed them to be there so long\r\n\r\nas we were co-located with them.  And because we were co-located\r\n\r\nwith  them,  our  Customs officers and our Immigration  officers\r\n\r\nwere  there to lend them legal authority.  Because they have  no\r\n\r\nlegal  authority to exercise functions of arrest and  so  on  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number two. The logical sequence was not a problem.\r\n\r\nPassengers who were to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nboard a train had to clear Singapore Immigration first and  then\r\n\r\nclear  Malaysian Immigration.  So those are the two main reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  we  have  permitted and allowed the state of affairs.   But\r\n\r\nonce  we  move  to  Woodlands, (a) they do not  have  the  legal\r\n\r\nauthority, and (b) the logical sequence will be totally contrary\r\n\r\nto international practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered my\r\n\r\nquestion.  Let me rephrase the question.

They have not told us how they intend to do or whatever\r\n\r\nthey  are going to do at Tanjong Pagar.  And until we know that,\r\n\r\nwe  are  unable to determine what exactly is going to happen  to\r\n\r\nthe  passengers or to the passports of the passengers.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  we  have said yesterday that obviously because the  logical\r\n\r\nsequence  is completely askew, passengers may face difficulties.\r\n\r\nWhat  exactly  are  these difficulties  they  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\ndetermined only after tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, the Minister has\r\n\r\nanswered  my question.

The passengers\r\n\r\nmust seek clearance from the Malaysian authorities.  They cannot\r\n\r\nleave Tanjong Pagar.  So they have got to take the train back to\r\n\r\nWoodlands, get clearance from the Singapore Immigration and then\r\n\r\nthey  can leave.

If we do withdraw the recognition of these rights,\r\n\r\ndoes  it  therefore  mean that they are operating  illegally  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?

But  in answer to one other question,  I  said  that\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have  agreed to consider the legal  arguments,  and\r\n\r\ngiven the period of three months, it is not a question of taking\r\n\r\naction  against  their  presence  in  Tanjong  Pagar  but,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly, a question as to what exactly they are going to do.\r\n\r\nWill  it  result  in  an  insistence on clearing  passengers  at\r\n\r\nWoodlands for entry into Malaysia when they have not got out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore?

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had informed this House on 19th November last year that\r\n\r\nGovernment would be amending the law to make it easier  for  en-bloc sales to take place.  The current position is that a single\r\n\r\nowner,  for  whatever reason, can oppose and  thwart  the  sale.\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  received  many  appeals  and   feedback   from\r\n\r\nfrustrated  owners  whose  desires  to  sell  their   flats   or\r\n\r\ncondominiums  en-bloc have been so thwarted. As a result,  these\r\n\r\nbuildings  cannot  take  advantage of enhanced  plot  ratios  to\r\n\r\nrealise  their  full  development potential,  which  would  have\r\n\r\ncreated  many more housing units in prime 999-year leasehold  or\r\n\r\nfreehold  areas for Singaporeans.  A secondary benefit  is  that\r\n\r\nthese  developments, especially the older ones, could have  been\r\n\r\nrejuvenated through the en-bloc process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that the law would be amended to remove the need for\r\n\r\nunanimous consent.  I highlighted the fact that such a  practice\r\n\r\nwould not be peculiar to Singapore, as it already exists in some\r\n\r\nAmerican  and Canadian states. I emphasised that in  land-scarce\r\n\r\nSingapore, such an approach was even more imperative as it would\r\n\r\nmake  available more prime land for higher-intensity development\r\n\r\nto  build  more  quality housing in Singapore.  In  fact,  since\r\n\r\nthen,  Hong  Kong  has also passed legislation  along  the  same\r\n\r\nlines.   In  February this year, also in this House, I  outlined\r\n\r\nthe  main  features  of  the  new  scheme.   In  particular,   I\r\n\r\nhighlighted  the fact that safeguards would be put in  place  to\r\n\r\nprotect the interests of the minority owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now highlight the key features of the proposed new\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Government will not decide which developments are\r\n\r\nready or ripe for en-bloc redevelopment.  The owners will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndecide that for themselves. There are too many factors at  play,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the age and state of repairs of the development, market\r\n\r\nconditions,  sentiments  of  the  owners  and  the  relationship\r\n\r\namongst them.  As announced previously, what the Bill will do is\r\n\r\npeg the required majority consent to the development's age - the\r\n\r\nmajority  owners  must account for at least  90%  of  the  share\r\n\r\nvalues  for  developments less than 10 years old,  and  80%  for\r\n\r\ndevelopments 10 years or more. This approach will facilitate the\r\n\r\nredevelopment of older buildings.  It is also in line  with  the\r\n\r\napproach  in  other countries - Nova Scotia, New  Brunswick  and\r\n\r\nOntario  in  Canada  (80%);   British  Columbia,  Canada  (75%);\r\n\r\nHawaii (80%) and Hong Kong (90%, but where the law also provides\r\n\r\nthat  the  Chief  Executive  in  Council  may  specify  a  lower\r\n\r\npercentage  not  less  than  80% in certain  circumstances).   A\r\n\r\nhigher  percentage  is  not practical, a  lower  percentage  not\r\n\r\nappropriate given the importance of the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current requirement of unanimous consent is untenable.\r\n\r\nThe case of  Kim Lin Mansions which was recently highlighted  in\r\n\r\nthe  press brings this out clearly.  Community living, which  is\r\n\r\nthe  heart  of living in a condominium, all but disappears  when\r\n\r\nowners  have to drag out their disagreement in court,  incurring\r\n\r\nhuge  financial  outlays in the process.  There is  uncertainty;\r\n\r\nthere  is delay; there is acrimony.   Also, as more developments\r\n\r\nage  and incur large upgrading and repair bills, opting for  en-bloc  sale  will increasingly become a viable option.   But  the\r\n\r\nexisting law which requires unanimous consent makes it extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to realise en-bloc sales.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the principle of majority rule is evident in other\r\n\r\nareas  of  shared  social and corporate life.  Examples  abound.\r\n\r\nThey  include  decisions  relating to managing  and  maintaining\r\n\r\ncommon  areas  in  condominiums  under  the  Land  Titles   Act;\r\n\r\nprivatisation  of  HUDC flats;  upgrading works  under  the  HDB\r\n\r\nUpgrading  Programme;  voluntary liquidation  of  a  company  or\r\n\r\ndissolution of a society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developments with 10 or fewer units will still require\r\n\r\nunanimous consent. With\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  small numbers, it is not possible to designate a clear  80%\r\n\r\nor  90%  majority.   Even if we base it on an approximation,  it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be meaningful, as one owner's disagreement  in  such\r\n\r\nsmall  units may constitute a large percentage.  For such  small\r\n\r\ndevelopments, the owners should be able to negotiate  and  agree\r\n\r\namongst themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there will be adequate safeguards to protect the\r\n\r\ninterests of minority owners. These safeguards are found in  the\r\n\r\nprocedures  as well as in the substantive powers of  the  Strata\r\n\r\nTitles Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first touch on the procedures. The majority owners\r\n\r\nwill  first enter into a conditional sale and purchase agreement\r\n\r\nto sell to a purchaser, subject to their obtaining an order from\r\n\r\nthe  Strata Titles Board.  Thereafter, they must give notice  of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed  en-bloc sale in the newspapers.  They  must  also\r\n\r\nseparately  serve  notice of the proposed en-bloc  sale  on  all\r\n\r\ninterested   parties,  including  the  owners,  mortgagees   and\r\n\r\nchargees  of  the minority owners as well as on  the  management\r\n\r\ncorporation.  This notice must be accompanied by a copy  of  the\r\n\r\nadvertisement published in the newspapers, the conditional  sale\r\n\r\nand  purchase  agreement, the valuation report and  the  buyer's\r\n\r\nstatutory declaration stating his relationship, if any,  to  the\r\n\r\nowners.  The conditional sale and purchase agreement must  state\r\n\r\nthe  price  and  method of distributing the sale  proceeds.  The\r\n\r\nmajority  owners must then apply to the Strata Titles Board  for\r\n\r\nan order of sale, enclosing the documents mentioned earlier. The\r\n\r\nminority owners and their mortgagees or chargee would then  have\r\n\r\n21 days to file their objections, if any, with the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These procedures will ensure that all relevant parties will\r\n\r\nhave  adequate  notice of the sale and its terms,  in  order  to\r\n\r\ndecide whether or not to lodge objections with the Strata Titles\r\n\r\nBoard.  I should add that no application needs to be made to the\r\n\r\nStrata  Titles Board if all the owners agree to  the  sale.   In\r\n\r\nother words, application to the Board is not a pre-requisite  to\r\n\r\nall en-bloc sales but only when there is no unanimous consent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now elaborate on the role of the Board, in\r\n\r\nparticular,  how  it acts as a safeguard. The Board  will  first\r\n\r\nsatisfy  itself that the required consent has been obtained  and\r\n\r\nthat prescribed procedures have been complied with.  It will not\r\n\r\nreview   or   intervene  to  determine  the   terms   of   sale.\r\n\r\nEssentially, its role is to determine that the proposed sale  is\r\n\r\nbona  fide and an arm's length transaction so that the  proposed\r\n\r\nsale can proceed.  It will do this by considering the minority's\r\n\r\nobjections,   the   interests  of  all  the  owners,   all   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances of the case and the scheme and intent of  the  en-bloc  provisions in the Bill.  The Board will look at the   sale\r\n\r\nprice,  method of distributing the sale proceeds to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  minority  owners  are treated no less favourably  than  the\r\n\r\nmajority,  and the relationship of the purchaser to the  owners,\r\n\r\nto ensure that there is no collusion.  If the Board decides that\r\n\r\nthe  transaction  is bona fide and an arm's length  transaction,\r\n\r\nthe  sale will proceed.  Otherwise, the sale cannot proceed  and\r\n\r\nthe  majority owners would have to rework their proposal if they\r\n\r\nstill  wish  to sell en-bloc.   The Board will not  rewrite  the\r\n\r\nagreement for the parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will consider, as I have said, all the objections\r\n\r\nfiled  by  the  minority owners, their mortgagees and  chargees.\r\n\r\nSome minority owners may raise objections which are personal  in\r\n\r\nnature or peculiar to their own circumstances, eg, he has bought\r\n\r\nhis  unit recently at a much higher price than that paid for  by\r\n\r\nthe other owners, or he has spent a large amount on renovations.\r\n\r\nOthers may raise objections based on sentimental reasons, eg, he\r\n\r\nhas  lived in the development for a long time and does not  wish\r\n\r\nto move out.  The Board will mediate in these situations.  It is\r\n\r\nexpected  that  skilful mediation will overcome  many  of  these\r\n\r\nobjections.   If  mediation fails, the  sale  will  nevertheless\r\n\r\nproceed  as  long as the transaction is bona fide and  at  arm's\r\n\r\nlength,  unless there are exceptional circumstances  to  warrant\r\n\r\nthe Board assuming a more pro-active role; for example, the sale\r\n\r\nproceeds are lower than the purchase price he had paid  for  the\r\n\r\nunit  or are insufficient to redeem the outstanding mortgage  or\r\n\r\ncharge on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunit.   This is based on the underlying assumption that none  of\r\n\r\nthe owners in an en-bloc sale should lose out financially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Board's decision will be final. An appeal can be\r\n\r\nmade to the High Court only on a point of law, or where there is\r\n\r\nalleged  irregularity in the process.  Owners will be  precluded\r\n\r\nfrom  applying  to  the court under section 78  of  the  Act  to\r\n\r\nterminate a strata development if they are not granted an  order\r\n\r\nfrom  the Board for an en-bloc sale or are unable to secure  the\r\n\r\nrequired   majority  consent,  unless  there   are   exceptional\r\n\r\nextenuating  circumstances such as the majority owners  refusing\r\n\r\nto  pay for repairs to prevent a building from being unsafe.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, section 78 will remain in the Act but is used  for\r\n\r\nvery specific circumstances.  There will therefore be finality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new scheme will apply to three types of strata\r\n\r\ndevelopments:  those registered under the Land  Titles  (Strata)\r\n\r\nAmendment Act where the owners own their units and share in  the\r\n\r\ncommon   property,  which  is  the  vast  majority;  those   not\r\n\r\nregistered  under the Land Titles (Strata) Act where the  owners\r\n\r\nown  their  units  and a share in the land but  do  not  have  a\r\n\r\nmanagement  corporation framework under the Act; and  those  not\r\n\r\nregistered  under  the  Land  Titles  (Strata)  Act  where   the\r\n\r\ndeveloper still owns the land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now deal quickly with a few other ancillary\r\n\r\nmatters.  The first is strengthening of the Strata Titles Board.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill  provides  for a number of changes to  facilitate  the\r\n\r\nexpeditious  hearing of applications.  These include  increasing\r\n\r\nthe number of panel members from 20 to 24; appointing two Deputy\r\n\r\nPresidents  instead  of one; empowering  the  Secretary  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard,  to  be  called the Registrar, to deal with interlocutory\r\n\r\napplications  and empowering the Board to allow  any  person  to\r\n\r\nrepresent an applicant before the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other noteworthy amendment, which is not related to en-bloc sales, is that the Board's jurisdiction will be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpanded  to  enable  it to have wider powers  relating  to  the\r\n\r\nexercise  or  failure to exercise a power,  authority,  duty  or\r\n\r\nfunction imposed by the Act or by the by-laws.  For example,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  empowered to hear and settle disputes arising  from  a\r\n\r\nbreach  or  failure  to perform any statutory  duty  or  by-laws\r\n\r\nrelating  to  a  strata  development.  Currently,  a  subsidiary\r\n\r\nproprietor  or  Management Corporation must apply  to  court  to\r\n\r\nenforce  the performance or restrain the breach.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, the Board will no longer hear cases on the liability of  a\r\n\r\ndeveloper.   Proceedings  against a developer  for  defects  are\r\n\r\nbased on contract, which is a matter for the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I should add that the new scheme will only\r\n\r\napply  to  strata  developments.  It will not  apply  to  landed\r\n\r\ndevelopments.   Strata developments, unlike landed developments,\r\n\r\nare founded on the concept of community living, shared ownership\r\n\r\nof   common   property  in  designated  values,  and  individual\r\n\r\nownership  of strata title which is essentially air space.   All\r\n\r\nthese distinguishing features of strata developments support the\r\n\r\nnew approach based on majority consent for en-bloc sales.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Bill has attracted considerable public\r\n\r\ninterest,  Government has decided, as suggested by several  MPs,\r\n\r\nboth in and outside the House, including the Chairman of the GPC\r\n\r\nfor  Law  and  Home  Affairs, to refer this  Bill  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.   This  will also enable interested  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic to share their views on the provisions of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the\r\n\r\nBill.  At  the  peak  of the property boom,  this  Bill  or  its\r\n\r\nunderlying  principles  would  have  been  welcomed   by   most.\r\n\r\nMinority  subsidiary proprietors who choose not  to  sell  their\r\n\r\nproperty in en-bloc sales would have been dismayed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is controversial. Some say that it is to aid\r\n\r\nmajority  subsidiary proprietors who stand to  make  substantial\r\n\r\ngains when their apartments are sold en-bloc than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  would otherwise not have.  It can also be said to  oppress\r\n\r\nthe  minority who refuses to sell for whatever reasons,  whether\r\n\r\nit  is  to  demand exorbitant prices for their property  or  for\r\n\r\nsentimental reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, doing nothing will not be the responsible approach in\r\n\r\nland  scarce  Singapore.   Whether it  is  the  tyranny  of  the\r\n\r\nminority  or  the  oppression of the  minority  is  a  secondary\r\n\r\nconcern.   The  most  crucial consideration is  in  achieving  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between the two conflicting needs and  that  there  are\r\n\r\nstatutory  instruments  in  place to ensure  that  ultimately  a\r\n\r\nproposal  for redevelopment fits into and blends well  with  the\r\n\r\nlong term development plans of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without legislation, the redevelopment of old and\r\n\r\ninefficient land use developments is a costly process.  There is\r\n\r\npresently  a case in our courts, and the Minister of  State  has\r\n\r\nmentioned the Kim Lin Mansions case, on this very issue and  the\r\n\r\nlegal wrangling is causing owners on both sides of the divide  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of money.  This is not taking into account the human\r\n\r\ncosts  of  uneasy neighbourhoods and of course sleepless  nights\r\n\r\nfor  some of the owners.  This Bill when passed will go  a  long\r\n\r\nway to address this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For whatever reason one wants to remain in a home, there is\r\n\r\na  need  to  ensure that the overriding interests of society  at\r\n\r\nlarge must be met.  There must be a mechanism in place to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our city-state does not contain pockets of slums and  that\r\n\r\nsufficiently old buildings are safe and well maintained.  Having\r\n\r\nsaid that, however, I am of the view that a 10-year old building\r\n\r\nis still a new building and using 10 years as a yardstick may be\r\n\r\ntoo  short  a  benchmark.   The stringent  requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control Department have resulted in much  money  being\r\n\r\ninvested to ensure that our buildings will withstand the test of\r\n\r\ntime and more.  It will indeed be a waste of money and resources\r\n\r\nif  a  building that is less than 10 years old be allowed to  be\r\n\r\ntorn  down  and  redeveloped.   It may  also  create  uneasiness\r\n\r\namongst  potential  buyers who cannot be  sure  if  an  intended\r\n\r\npurchase will be the target of an en-bloc sale.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, therefore, I urge the Government to reconsider a\r\n\r\nchange in some of the details in the Bill.  Hence, as this  Bill\r\n\r\nwhen  passed  will have a substantial impact on  a  majority  of\r\n\r\nprivate  property  owners, I welcome the  Government's  move  to\r\n\r\ncommit this Bill to a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;En-bloc sale and redevelopment is an excellent way to\r\n\r\nrejuvenate  some  old  estates which are devoid  or  lacking  in\r\n\r\namenities  and facilities.  This complements what is being  done\r\n\r\nin  the public sector.  With the Government spending billions of\r\n\r\ndollars  in  main  and  interim upgrading programmes  in  public\r\n\r\nhousing  estates, private housing estates, especially the  older\r\n\r\nones, should be encouraged to do likewise through en-bloc sales.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak  in  support of the Bill in principle, and appreciate  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  express  a  number  of  concerns  that  I  have\r\n\r\nregarding  its provisions for en-bloc sales, that  is,  the  new\r\n\r\nsections 84A to F.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, property rights in law are traditionally distinguished\r\n\r\nfrom other legal rights because they are of such importance  and\r\n\r\nvalue to those who hold them.  The right to enjoy one's property\r\n\r\nand to choose a time to dispose of it is regarded very much as a\r\n\r\nbasic right of ownership.  People pay higher premiums to acquire\r\n\r\ninterests  in  land  that allow them to enjoy  such  rights  and\r\n\r\neventually  to pass them down to their successors  in  title  in\r\n\r\nperpetuity.  These rights should be overridden only in the  most\r\n\r\ncompelling circumstances, where the public interest requires it,\r\n\r\nand  must  be seen to be manifestly beneficial to the public  in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  for example, building infrastructural facilities  such\r\n\r\nas roads, MRT lines, stations and airports.  In Hong Kong, where\r\n\r\nthey  have  a  similar  law  -  the Land  (Compulsory  Sale  for\r\n\r\nRedevelopment) Ordinance No. 30 of 1998 - the objective  was  to\r\n\r\nredevelop  many of the old estates in Hong Kong through  private\r\n\r\nmeans.   In Singapore, the need to do so may not be so  obvious,\r\n\r\nas  many  estates  are fairly new and, in  any  case,  are  well\r\n\r\nmaintained, as regulated by law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public interest in the proposed law therefore is not so\r\n\r\nevident.  It is altogether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifferent  when  what  is  at stake  is  a  purely  economic  or\r\n\r\npecuniary decision.  That is, when the decision to take away the\r\n\r\nright  of  ownership, albeit with compensation, on pure economic\r\n\r\ngrounds alone - such as the redevelopment of an estate that  may\r\n\r\njust  be  10  years  old  - to make way  for  a  more  lucrative\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  It is essentially a private deal, between majority\r\n\r\nowners and developers.  In such an instance, there is a need  to\r\n\r\nensure that all minority owners' interests are well protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People acquire property for different reasons - I am not\r\n\r\nconcerned for those who are acquiring property as an investment,\r\n\r\nsince  that  essentially  is a matter of economic  compensation,\r\n\r\nwhich  fits  well with the idea of en-bloc sales.   For  someone\r\n\r\nelse  - let us say a retiree - who purchases a property to  stay\r\n\r\nin,  and  who chooses a particular flat in a particular location\r\n\r\nto be, for example, near her children or a medical facility, the\r\n\r\nidea  of  compensation in pure monetary  terms  may  be  a  poor\r\n\r\nsubstitute.  The costs of relocation, the giving up  of  a  home\r\n\r\nthat one has spent many happy years -  these are neither easy to\r\n\r\nquantify nor easily compensated in monetary terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cynical among us may say that there is a price for\r\n\r\neverything - and so there may be, but in reality, I do not  know\r\n\r\nhow these issues are likely to be dealt with in the Act, despite\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of State's assurance.  Or whether such issues  can\r\n\r\nbe  dealt with satisfactorily, no matter what the Act says.   As\r\n\r\nit  stands,  the Act gives no guidance on how such  non-material\r\n\r\nconsiderations are to be taken into account, if at all.   It  is\r\n\r\ninteresting  to  note  in  this  context  that  the  Hong   Kong\r\n\r\nlegislation referred to earlier mentions, for example,  the  age\r\n\r\nor  state of repair of the existing development.  The Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nOrdinance  also  requires subsidiary legislation specifying  the\r\n\r\ngrounds on which an order for sale may be made.  In my view,  it\r\n\r\nis  necessary  to enact similar regulations, especially  if  the\r\n\r\ndecision  is left to the Strata Titles Board.  This is the  next\r\n\r\nissue to which I shall now turn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is stated that these matters may be brought before the\r\n\r\nStrata  Titles  Board, and that the Board will  have  powers  to\r\n\r\nmediate,  to  call  for valuation reports and finally,  to  make\r\n\r\norders.   Such orders are binding on minority owners who  object\r\n\r\nto  the  sale.   These  are  orders  that  significantly  affect\r\n\r\nproperty   rights.   I  wonder  whether  it  is  not  altogether\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  have  an application made  to  the  High  Court\r\n\r\ninstead of the Tribunal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Land Titles Act, sections 77 and 78, actually\r\n\r\nprovides for application to the court in relation to a variation\r\n\r\nof  strata  subdivision  scheme consequent  upon  damage  to  or\r\n\r\ndestruction  of a subdivided building, and to termination  of  a\r\n\r\nstrata subdivision scheme.  Surely, the powers of the court  can\r\n\r\nbe  extended to cover the matter of en-bloc sales.  This may  at\r\n\r\nleast  provide  some  comfort  to minority  owners  who  may  be\r\n\r\ndispossessed by such an order.  The judiciary is used to matters\r\n\r\ninvolving private parties; the judges are used to quantification\r\n\r\nof  damages, including large amounts of damages.  They are  used\r\n\r\nto taking into account non-economic considerations, such as pain\r\n\r\nand  suffering.  The Strata Titles Board, talented though it may\r\n\r\nbe  in  property matters, is not used to this type of work.   In\r\n\r\nany event, it is in my view imperative that if such a Board were\r\n\r\nto decide on this matter, Parliament should ensure that there be\r\n\r\nspecified grounds on which an order of sale can be made, similar\r\n\r\nto that provided in the Hong Kong legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other matters that I should like to draw\r\n\r\nattention  to.   The  first, as has been mentioned  by  the  GPC\r\n\r\nChairman,  relates to the 10-year rule.  That is to  say,  if  a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is  more  than  10  years  old,  only  80%  of  the\r\n\r\nsubsidiary proprietors need to agree (or if it is less  than  10\r\n\r\nyears,  90%).   Sir,  in  the context of estate  development  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  where  estates are generally well  maintained,  this\r\n\r\nseems  too early a period to speak of en-bloc sales.   Would  it\r\n\r\nnot  be a waste of economic resources to tear down a development\r\n\r\nthat  is  only  10  years  old  or less?   Especially,  if  some\r\n\r\nsubsidiary owners would like to continue to live in it.  Would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  sort  of  rule adversely affect the maintenance  level  of\r\n\r\nestates?   Is  there a commitment, for example, to  upgrade  the\r\n\r\nlifts  if  it  were known that a developer has been  eyeing  the\r\n\r\nestate with a view to redevelopment?  Again, it would seem  that\r\n\r\nmore specific regulations are needed to control such a situation\r\n\r\nand a review of the 10-year rule should take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I refer to a technical problem, the issue of\r\n\r\nnotice and objections.  This relates to the safeguards that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  has  just mentioned.   Under  the  proposed\r\n\r\nsection 84A(1), majority subsidiary proprietors who have secured\r\n\r\na  conditional agreement of sale may apply to the Board  for  an\r\n\r\norder  of  sale  to  be  made  out.   Under  section  84A(4),  a\r\n\r\nsubsidiary proprietor who does not agree to the sale has to file\r\n\r\nan  objection within 21 days of the date of notice served in the\r\n\r\nnormal  case.   The  failure to file an  objection  has  serious\r\n\r\nconsequences under subsection (6) - the Board is under a duty if\r\n\r\nit  does not receive any objection to order a sale!  Nowhere  in\r\n\r\nthe  section  is  it  provided as to  who  is  to  inform  those\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  proprietors who have not entered into agreements  of\r\n\r\nsale  about  the  application  to the  Board.   Subsection  (10)\r\n\r\nprovides  for notice by registered post but does not make  clear\r\n\r\nwho  has the obligation to inform the minority.  Would it be the\r\n\r\nBoard  or  the  applicants for the order of sale?  Such  matters\r\n\r\nhave yet to be clarified in the legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that in land scarce Singapore, optimal land\r\n\r\nuse  is  always a priority.  Yet, for the same reason,  property\r\n\r\ninterests are so much more important to those who have purchased\r\n\r\nthem,  especially on the open market.  There is a need therefore\r\n\r\nfor the Minister to reassure this House, and indeed, the people,\r\n\r\nthat  encroachment  into the proprietary interests  of  minority\r\n\r\nowners  should  be  allowed  only  in  the  most  convincing  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I give my qualified support to this Bill and hope that\r\n\r\nthese issues would be taken up in the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this\r\n\r\nBill was introduced to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfacilitate the en-bloc sales of certain property.  I support the\r\n\r\nunderlying principle of the Bill because I believe that  en-bloc\r\n\r\nsales,  if  made  easier,  would  prevent  old  properties  from\r\n\r\ndegenerating  into slums.  In the last few years  when  property\r\n\r\nprices  were  higher  and  plot ratios  in  certain  areas  were\r\n\r\nincreased,  we  saw  many  condominiums  and  apartment   owners\r\n\r\nattempting  to  sell their properties en-bloc.   Some  succeeded\r\n\r\nwhile  others  failed.  Those that failed owed  it  to  the  few\r\n\r\nowners  who  held  out for various reasons.   Some  have  noble,\r\n\r\nsentimental  reasons, while others just wanted more  money  than\r\n\r\ntheir neighbours.  Those that failed to sell en-bloc have missed\r\n\r\nthe  boat  for  the time being and are in danger of degenerating\r\n\r\ninto  slums during the trough of the economic cycle as  many  of\r\n\r\nthese properties are fairly old.  In a case like this, one could\r\n\r\nsay  that  we  had  a  tyranny of the small  minority  over  the\r\n\r\nmajority.   I  sympathise  with  the  majority  of  the   owners\r\n\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In debating this Bill, one cannot do so without going into\r\n\r\nthe  issue of individual rights over that of society.   Although\r\n\r\none  of  our core values is society above self, in this context,\r\n\r\nwe  must  look  at what this larger society is, that  self  must\r\n\r\nsacrifice  too.   In  the case of private land  acquisition  for\r\n\r\npublic   roads,  highways,  drainage  or  MRT  lines,  one   can\r\n\r\nunderstand the need for this as the larger society that benefits\r\n\r\nwould be people one can count in the realm of thousands, if  not\r\n\r\ntens  of thousands or hundreds of thousands, who use the  public\r\n\r\nfacilities.   In  the case of en-bloc sales, the larger  society\r\n\r\nthat benefits is one's neighbours, maybe 10, maybe 100, who just\r\n\r\nwant  more  money for their units if sold en-bloc than  if  sold\r\n\r\nindividually.  The question therefore is: should the  individual\r\n\r\nbe  made to subsume his interest to that of the society so  that\r\n\r\nthe latter can make more money?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could argue that money is not the only issue and that\r\n\r\nthe  main  reason  is  really  to prevent  the  condominiums  or\r\n\r\napartment  blocks  from degenerating into slums.   If  that  was\r\n\r\ntrue, then one could argue that en-bloc sale is not the only way\r\n\r\nto prevent this from happening.  One could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngo  for  upgrading programmes and refurbishment as  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nmajor  upgrading  programmes.  In this case, under  the  current\r\n\r\nlaw, only 75% of share values in the estate need to approve  for\r\n\r\nsuch  upgrading  to  proceed.  Since  the  larger  society  that\r\n\r\nbenefits from self-sacrifice is not as noble in the case of  en-bloc  sales of private properties for redevelopment  as  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  acquisition for public projects,  I  contend  that  we\r\n\r\nshould maintain a balance of individual rights over that of  the\r\n\r\nother  neighbours.  The question then is: what is  that  correct\r\n\r\nbalance?   I  suggest we should then go back to the  fundamental\r\n\r\nreason for which this Bill was meant to achieve and, that is, to\r\n\r\nprevent the degeneration of old private properties into slums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill proposes that, in the case of properties less\r\n\r\nthan 10 years old, 90% of the share values would suffice for  an\r\n\r\napplication to be made to the Board for an order for sale of all\r\n\r\nthe  lots  in  common  property to  proceed.   In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nproperties above 10 years old, 80% of the share values  agreeing\r\n\r\nwould  suffice.  My question is:  are properties  less  than  10\r\n\r\nyears  old  in danger of degenerating into slums?   To  me,  the\r\n\r\nanswer  is  obviously  no.  In my view, the  age  of  properties\r\n\r\nshould  be the key deciding factor here which determines whether\r\n\r\nthe  individual's  right to hold out should be ridden  roughshod\r\n\r\nover.   For  older  properties, the danger of degeneration  into\r\n\r\nslums  becomes more real.  In this case, we should give  greater\r\n\r\nweightage to the needs of the majority of the other owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that some judgement and subjectivity is involved.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  my  own  view and judgement, I  propose  that  for\r\n\r\nproperties  less than 10 years old, 100% of share values  should\r\n\r\nstill   be  maintained  for  en-bloc  sales  to  proceed.    For\r\n\r\nproperties  between  10 and 20 years old, 90%  of  share  values\r\n\r\ncould  suffice, and for properties above 20 years old, then  80%\r\n\r\nof share values could suffice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, tearing down of fairly new buildings is a\r\n\r\nwaste  of  national resources and should not be  encouraged.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmy  suggestion is more equitable and maintains a better  balance\r\n\r\nbetween  individual rights and the good of the  larger  society.\r\n\r\nAnd  with  this, at least the individual has the peace  of  mind\r\n\r\nthat  in the first 10 years of the life of his new property,  he\r\n\r\nwould  not wake up one morning to be rudely told that he has  to\r\n\r\nmove out, because his neighbours have decided to cash out in  an\r\n\r\nen-bloc sale.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as everybody is\r\n\r\naware, the emergence of en-bloc sales in Singapore is mainly due\r\n\r\nto  the present Development Guide Plan (GDP), where the usage of\r\n\r\nland  is  capable  of  being  intensified  from  that  which  is\r\n\r\ncurrently  being  used.  This Land Titles  (Strata)  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  is meant to facilitate the redevelopment of land for  more\r\n\r\nintensified  use,  and I think it covers most  of  the  possible\r\n\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in my opinion, there are two situations which have\r\n\r\nbeen  missed  out and should be considered.  Situation  1.   The\r\n\r\nBill  deals with a case where the subsidiary proprietors of  the\r\n\r\nlots  holding not less than 80% or 90% of the share values  wish\r\n\r\nto  sell to the purchaser.  But it does not, however, appear  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  a situation where one subsidiary proprietor  of  the\r\n\r\nlots  already owns 80% or 90% of the share values and wishes  to\r\n\r\npurchase  the  remaining  10% or 20%.  If  the  said  subsidiary\r\n\r\nproprietor wishes to sell to the purchaser, it would be possible\r\n\r\nunder  the  Bill to apply to the Board for an order.  There  is,\r\n\r\nhowever,  no  provision to allow this subsidiary  proprietor  to\r\n\r\napply to the Board for an order to purchase the remaining 10% or\r\n\r\n20%.   I  feel that the Board, in the spirit of the Bill, should\r\n\r\nassist such a subsidiary proprietor.  Of course, some safeguards\r\n\r\nmust  be  built  in  for  such  a situation,  for  example,  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  two independent valuers or the said  subsidiary\r\n\r\nproprietor  must acquire the remaining 10% or 20% only  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  redevelopment.  If this situation was not  covered,\r\n\r\nthe said subsidiary proprietor who meets with objection from the\r\n\r\nremaining subsidiary proprietors of the building would then  not\r\n\r\nbe able to redevelop the land to its fullest potential.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  situation is similar to an en-bloc sale which has resulted\r\n\r\nin this Amendment Bill in the first place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only recourse for such a subsidiary proprietor would be\r\n\r\nto  sell to a purchaser.   Of course, one can argue that he  can\r\n\r\nalways  set up a company to be the purchaser, but the  procedure\r\n\r\nwould  attract more stamp duties, more legal cost, etc.   And  I\r\n\r\nfeel that the spirit of this Bill should be to facilitate the en-bloc sale and not to collect more revenue for the Government  if\r\n\r\nthe situation does not require it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Situation 2, and this is a more complicated one.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are some land developments on sizable plots  of\r\n\r\nland in Singapore where the DGP allows for more intensified  use\r\n\r\nthan  its  current use.  But the intensification is not  to  the\r\n\r\nextent that it warrants the demolition of the existing buildings\r\n\r\non  the land, particularly if they are still quite new.  And  in\r\n\r\nsome cases, due to the layout of the existing development, there\r\n\r\nis  no  need to demolish any building and an additional building\r\n\r\ncan  actually  be erected on the site.  But it  means  that  the\r\n\r\nconsent of 100% of the subsidiary proprietors of the lots in the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  have  to  be obtained, and  some  objections  would\r\n\r\ndefinitely be raised.  I would like to ask the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nin  such a situation the same approach as taken by the Bill  for\r\n\r\nen-bloc  sale can be adopted, ie, if the subsidiary  proprietors\r\n\r\nof  the lots in the development holding not less than 80% of the\r\n\r\nshare  value consent to such a proposal, an application  can  be\r\n\r\nmade to the Board for an order to allow the proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, so far I have spoken about the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of the subsidiary proprietors of the  lots.   The\r\n\r\ninterests of the minority, of course, cannot be ignored.  I came\r\n\r\nto understand that some subsidiary proprietors object to en-bloc\r\n\r\nsale  because of their desire to send their children to a school\r\n\r\nwithin 1-2 km or their need to look after their elderly or  sick\r\n\r\nparents  nearby  or they have just recently completed  extensive\r\n\r\nrenovations to their premises.  I see a need for the  Board,  as\r\n\r\ndefined  in  the  Bill,  to  be  empowered  to  consider   these\r\n\r\nintangible\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfactors in their mediation or arbitration between the  disputing\r\n\r\nparties  and  possibly make adjustment to the  share  values  to\r\n\r\nachieve an equitable distribution of the values.  It will not be\r\n\r\nwise to pass this Bill to facilitate the development of land and\r\n\r\nignore  its  possible detrimental effects on the  other  ongoing\r\n\r\ngood  policies which are meant to encourage stronger family ties\r\n\r\nand  equitable treatment of our people.

In this regard, the primary  aim\r\n\r\nof this Bill, to allow changes in its Development Guide Plans to\r\n\r\nbe  translated into better utilisation of scarce land  resources\r\n\r\nand infrastructure can be supported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Land Acquisition Act that would allow the\r\n\r\nGovernment to acquire land and properties if it is in the public\r\n\r\ninterest to do so.  Therefore, if it is in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublic good to acquire residential properties even though it may\r\n\r\nbe  a building of, say, less than 10 years old, then it must  be\r\n\r\ndone.   After all, the law provides for compensation  at  market\r\n\r\nprices.   I  would  go  as far as to say  that  we  should  also\r\n\r\nconsider invoking the Land Acquisition Act if property owners or\r\n\r\nmanagement   corporations  fail  to  maintain  their  buildings.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  provisions  to  allow  management  corporations\r\n\r\ngreater powers to compel owners to maintain their properties are\r\n\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is another thing to say that neighbours and\r\n\r\nother  property owners can now decide or influence whether  they\r\n\r\ncan  now remain in their house, especially when en-bloc sale  is\r\n\r\njustified  purely  on  monetary gains  and  considerations,  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily for general public interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the frustration some property owners feel\r\n\r\nwhen  they  cannot  sell their property en-bloc  because,  under\r\n\r\npresent law, even a single owner can frustrate an en-bloc  sale.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I cannot accept or understand the extreme some  owners\r\n\r\nhave  gone to force and intimidate other minority owners to sell\r\n\r\ntheir  properties  en-bloc.   The  opportunity  for  quick   and\r\n\r\nsubstantial capital gains has blinded many of these owners  into\r\n\r\nthinking  that  everyone like themselves should decide  to  sell\r\n\r\ntheir houses simply on monetary considerations.  Many give scant\r\n\r\nattention  to  other  genuine reasons why some  property  owners\r\n\r\nprefer  not to sell their homes despite the potential  for  huge\r\n\r\nwindfall.   The elderly may not want to move out or be  burdened\r\n\r\nby  new  financial obligations.  The unique thing about property\r\n\r\nis  that there is only one of its kind.  Another house is  never\r\n\r\nexactly  the  same.   There  are  also  genuine  concerns  about\r\n\r\nlocation, for example, nearness and proximity to family members,\r\n\r\nschool  amenities  and  the  comfort and  familiarity  with  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  neighbourhood.  Even on purely monetary considerations,\r\n\r\nas different purchasers may have paid different prices for their\r\n\r\nproperty,  the monetary gains to different owners  are  not  the\r\n\r\nsame. Therefore, owners do not necessarily have the same\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincentives  and  motivation to sell, especially in  the  current\r\n\r\nproperty market.  What if the minority owners have to sell at  a\r\n\r\nloss?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that I think the Strata Titles Board\r\n\r\nshould be strengthened not only in numbers, as stated in section\r\n\r\n87,  but  also in terms of its representation so that the  Board\r\n\r\ncan  effectively  perform its function  of  protecting  minority\r\n\r\ninterest.   I  would  urge the Minister to provide  for  clearer\r\n\r\nguidelines to assist the Strata Titles Board so that the genuine\r\n\r\ninterests  of the minority are not sacrificed purely because  of\r\n\r\nthe  monetary interest of the majority.  It must be on the  onus\r\n\r\nof  the  majority  to ensure that every possible  way  has  been\r\n\r\nexplored  to  protect the minority interest through preferential\r\n\r\npurchase  of new apartments on redevelopment sites.   It  should\r\n\r\nalso  be the responsibility of the Strata Titles Board to ensure\r\n\r\nthat non-monetary issues and the interest of the minority owners\r\n\r\nare  given  sufficient weightage before the Strata Titles  Board\r\n\r\ncan make an order under section 84A(6) or (7).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, property ownership has a proprietary value which\r\n\r\nis   permanent  and  cannot  be  removed  except   for   special\r\n\r\ncircumstances, for example, by Government Land Acquisition.   As\r\n\r\nsuch,  the idea of Singapore as our home can be promoted because\r\n\r\nthere  is a sense of permanence to one's neighbourhood and home.\r\n\r\nIt  may  be bricks and mortars that make a house, but a home  is\r\n\r\nabout shared experiences, fond memories and emotional attachment\r\n\r\nthat  can never be equated in monetary terms. These are  matters\r\n\r\nthat  deserve  very  careful consideration.  Given  the  current\r\n\r\nproperty  market, there is a lesser need for  quick  action.   I\r\n\r\ntherefore  welcome the Minister's decision to refer this  matter\r\n\r\nto  a  Select Committee so that views from a wider cross section\r\n\r\nof  the  people can be obtained.  This issue has attracted  much\r\n\r\npublic   debate.   Clearly,  a  consensus  on  this  matter   is\r\n\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe that there should exist in Singapore the\r\n\r\nrecognition that in our homes or friends and our neighbours, our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemotional attachment to our neighbourhood are matters which  are\r\n\r\nfar more important than the windfall gains one can make from  an\r\n\r\nen-bloc sale.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\ndeclare my interest as the owner of a strata title lot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise in support of the Bill. In land-scarce\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we have no choice but to maximise land  use  through\r\n\r\nproper  land  use planning.  The recent revision and development\r\n\r\nof  the  Concept  and  Development Guide Plans  by  URA  clearly\r\n\r\nindicates the need to update land use plans in Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nis necessary so that we can keep up with changing population and\r\n\r\neconomic trends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill indeed will facilitate better utilisation of land\r\n\r\nthrough en-bloc sales of certain property.  At the same time, it\r\n\r\nwill   enable   the  Strata  Titles  Boards  to  function   more\r\n\r\neffectively  and efficiently for the benefit of  all  subsidiary\r\n\r\nproprietors and flat owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise the following points on the\r\n\r\nprinciples and implications of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Collective sale of property</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 inserts a new Part VA (containing new sections 84A\r\n\r\nto  84F) to facilitate en-bloc sales of land within a subdivided\r\n\r\nbuilding.  But it only applies to owners of flats or units in  a\r\n\r\nstrata  or subdivided building or development with more than  10\r\n\r\nunits  or  flats.   The  clause seems  to  discriminate  against\r\n\r\ndevelopments  of 10 units and less.  I hope the  Ministry  could\r\n\r\nclarify the need for this requirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to be consistent in encouraging en-bloc sales, we\r\n\r\nshould  remove this requirement and allow all developments  that\r\n\r\nare  eligible  for  en-bloc  sale to  make  an  application  for\r\n\r\ncollective sale.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Time period requirement for en-bloc sale</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill permits owners of 80% share value in a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  to apply for collective sale if the lots  are  more\r\n\r\nthan 10 years while a 90% share value is required\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  lots which are less than 10 years.  In principle,  I  agree\r\n\r\nthat the 80% and 90% share value requirement will facilitate en-bloc developments.  However, the 10-year time period requirement\r\n\r\nmay result in wastage of resources.  This is particularly so for\r\n\r\ndevelopments which are less than 10 years old.  Technically, the\r\n\r\nlife  span  of  a  building is about 60  years  before  physical\r\n\r\nobsolescence  takes  place.  But in  a  fast-pace  society  like\r\n\r\nSingapore,  buildings  tend to have shorter  life  span  due  to\r\n\r\neconomic obsolescence and changing social trends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this, it is wasteful to facilitate en-bloc sale and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of buildings that are less than 10 years  old.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  with  the  introduction of  new  building  materials  and\r\n\r\ntechnology,  buildings are built to last much longer.   Thus,  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Ministry will reconsider the time period  requirement\r\n\r\nfor en-bloc sale application.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, it would be prudent to specify that\r\n\r\napplications for en-bloc sales for developments below  10  years\r\n\r\nshould  obtain approval from the Minister.  This would curb  any\r\n\r\nspeculative  developments which may have other repercussions  or\r\n\r\neconomic implications.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Distribution of sale proceeds</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the stumbling blocks in en-bloc sale is the\r\n\r\nobtaining  of consensus among subsidiary proprietors  or  owners\r\n\r\nwith regard to the sharing of the sale proceeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsidiary proprietors or flat owners often have differing\r\n\r\nopinions  as to the methods of sharing the proceeds.   This  has\r\n\r\nindeed  hampered a number of potential en-bloc sales.  The  Bill\r\n\r\nhas not addressed this problem.  To facilitate en-bloc sale, the\r\n\r\nBill should state clearly the method or formula for sharing  the\r\n\r\nsale  proceeds.  Based on past en-bloc sales, the use  of  share\r\n\r\nvalue  has  been  commonly adopted as  an  acceptable  means  to\r\n\r\ndistribute the sale proceeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Jurisdiction of Strata Titles Boards</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 has removed the jurisdiction of the Strata Titles\r\n\r\nBoards to adjudicate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndisputes  between  management corporations and  developers.   In\r\n\r\npractice, management corporations often encounter problems  when\r\n\r\ntaking  over  new developments from developers.  These  problems\r\n\r\nmay  range  from  simple  disputes concerning  handing  over  of\r\n\r\nrelevant  documentation to major disputes  such  as  repairs  of\r\n\r\nmajor   building  defects.   Very  often,  these  disputes   are\r\n\r\ntechnical  in nature and could be either mediated or adjudicated\r\n\r\nby  the  Strata Titles Boards.  However, with the new amendment,\r\n\r\nall   these  disputes  would  have  to  go  to  the  courts  for\r\n\r\nsettlement.   As  such, it may create an influx of  cases,  thus\r\n\r\nhampering the efficiency of our courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we should expand the jurisdiction of the Strata\r\n\r\nTitles   Boards   to  adjudicate  disputes  between   management\r\n\r\ncorporations which have become common in recent years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Composition of Strata Titles Boards</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 increases the number of persons on a panel from\r\n\r\nwhich the Strata Titles Boards may be formed to 24. The increase\r\n\r\nof  panel  members from 20 to 24 is probably attributed  to  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the number of strata title developments,  and  the\r\n\r\namendment  in  section 86 which allows parties to a  dispute  to\r\n\r\nhave a say in the choice of members forming a board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the real estate and construction industry is small, it\r\n\r\nmay be better to increase the panel members so that the Minister\r\n\r\nwould  have  more  leeway to appoint one or more  Strata  Titles\r\n\r\nBoards to expedite dispute settlement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would suggest that in line with the principle of\r\n\r\nappointing  management corporation council  members,  we  should\r\n\r\nallow the Minister to appoint a panel of members but subject  it\r\n\r\nto  a  maximum of 30 members.  In this way, the number of  panel\r\n\r\nmembers may vary from time to time depending on the availability\r\n\r\nof expertise and the number of disputes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am obliged to you, Sir, for giving me\r\n\r\nthis opportunity.\r\n\r\nSir,  I rise to support the Bill and I congratulate the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  agreeing to send the Bill to a Select Committee.  This  has\r\n\r\nbeen proposed by Members as well as the public, because it is  a\r\n\r\nvery important question that we are going to deal with, ie,  the\r\n\r\nquestion of property rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, first of all, declare my interest. I am a\r\n\r\npractising  lawyer and I am also a member of the  Strata  Titles\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has limited land supply and it is of utmost\r\n\r\nimportance  that we utilise this to the maximum benefit  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   This  is why the success of Singapore  has  largely\r\n\r\nbeen  attributed  to  the  very  equitable  way  in  which  land\r\n\r\nacquisition has worked.  In this particular case, no acquisition\r\n\r\nis  being made.  All this Bill hopes to do is to facilitate  en-bloc sales.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one question that has bothered me and\r\n\r\nother  Members is this 10-year period.  It is not adequate.   We\r\n\r\nshould  at  least allow a minimum of 15 years.  I am happy  with\r\n\r\nthe requirement of a percentage of at least 80%, because I think\r\n\r\nthat  is  also the practice in other jurisdictions.  Prof.  Chin\r\n\r\nalso  spoke  about  the Strata Titles Board.   Sir,  the  Strata\r\n\r\nTitles  Board is made up of the President, Deputy President  and\r\n\r\ntwo  other members.  In fact, it is better than what you get  in\r\n\r\nthe  High  Court because in the High Court only a  single  judge\r\n\r\nhears  the  matter.   It would also be more expensive  and  time\r\n\r\nconsuming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other advantage which Members may want to know is that\r\n\r\nthe Board always tries to mediate.  In fact, I have been sitting\r\n\r\non the Board for more than a year now.  The matters which I have\r\n\r\ndealt with have always been settled without going through a full\r\n\r\nhearing.  So I would like to tell the Members of this House that\r\n\r\nthe  Strata Titles Board may be a more appropriate panel because\r\n\r\nit  is  made  up  of  people who are not just lawyers  but  also\r\n\r\nengineers and architects who appreciate the dispute better.   So\r\n\r\nI  hope  Prof.  Chin  would change his  view  after  hearing  my\r\n\r\narguments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been some complaints from members of the\r\n\r\npublic,  both in the news media as well as some people who  have\r\n\r\napproached me.  I know of a case of a retired librarian  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore who lives in Holland Road.  Her worry is\r\n\r\nthat  if her property is put up for en-bloc sale, she would miss\r\n\r\nthe  company  of relatives who are nearby and other  facilities.\r\n\r\nBut  I  tell  people who have this problem that  it  is  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of the community at large and especially, in  view  of\r\n\r\nthe MRT development, that we should allow maximum utilisation of\r\n\r\nour  land.   We  have  got  limited land  supply  and  community\r\n\r\ninterest must take precedence over that of the individual right.\r\n\r\nAs  I  said earlier, one of the advantages that we have is  that\r\n\r\nbecause we did not enshrine in the Constitution the right to own\r\n\r\nproperty, as some other countries did, we have this development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move to another area which I am a little concerned.\r\n\r\nProf.  Chin  has  also  mentioned this.   This  is  new  section\r\n\r\n84A(10).  The notice to be given requires only two days' notice.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  think that is sufficient.  If you post a  notice  on\r\n\r\nSaturday,  the next day is Sunday.  I think we should  at  least\r\n\r\nhave a minimum of five days' notice.  Another Member also raised\r\n\r\nthe  question of who is to give notice.  I think that  could  be\r\n\r\neasily addressed.  The Registry of the Strata Titles Board would\r\n\r\ngive the notice where members have not been served.  It could be\r\n\r\na condition that before an application is heard, all the parties\r\n\r\nhave been served properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area that I am concerned is this. If we do\r\n\r\nnot change the law and allow, as I have said earlier, the period\r\n\r\nof  10  years to stand, then a lot of properties that have  been\r\n\r\ndeveloped recently and are in good condition would be torn  down\r\n\r\nand rebuilt, which would be an economic loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which I think we should also consider is that\r\n\r\nprobably the owners of terrace houses in older estates may  wish\r\n\r\nto  have them developed if the plot ratio is increased from  two\r\n\r\nstoreys to three storeys.  Because some of these estates are  in\r\n\r\nfact in worse condition than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  HDB  estates which are better managed.   This  is\r\n\r\nsomething which the Minister may want to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the office of Registrar is being created and I am\r\n\r\ngrateful  to the Minister for this because, with this amendment,\r\n\r\nmany applications could be dealt with by the Registrar.  So  the\r\n\r\nfull  Board  does  not  have to sit.   All  we  require  is  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to deal with applications which are not controversial\r\n\r\nin  nature  and  it  would be helpful when the  law  comes  into\r\n\r\nexistence  to  appoint a Senior Legal Officer as the  Registrar.\r\n\r\nAt  the  moment, the person holding office is actually qualified\r\n\r\nfor District Judge.  I hope the practice will continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, I would like to assure Members once\r\n\r\nagain,  my experience over the years is that both parties always\r\n\r\nwant  to  discuss  the  matter and,  in  fact,  in  most  cases,\r\n\r\nmediation succeeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> I am much obliged, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.   I  rise to welcome the reference by the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState of this Bill to a Select Committee, which some of us  have\r\n\r\nasked.   I think we need to carefully consider the Bill  because\r\n\r\nwe  are  changing  existing rules and private  rights.   We  are\r\n\r\nchanging  the ball game.  And I want to share some comments  and\r\n\r\nthoughts  with  the Minister, hoping that this will  go  to  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee, based on four topics: first, the question  of\r\n\r\npublic  interest;  second, the difference  and  balance  between\r\n\r\nprivate  property  and what the Minister  of  State  has  called\r\n\r\n\"communal living\"; third, the safeguards; and fourth, the use of\r\n\r\nthe Strata Titles Board as opposed to court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is on public interest. As many Members have\r\n\r\nsaid,  land  is  a scarce resource and Singaporeans  accept  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  land  acquisition  for  public  interest  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Some,  however, will feel  that  these  amendments\r\n\r\ndiffer on the public interest but instead serve windfall private\r\n\r\nprofit.  I also agree, as many have pointed out, that there is a\r\n\r\npublic  interest to protect Singapore's landscape against slums.\r\n\r\nHowever, I urge us just to consider that this concern can be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmet  much more simply.  Government authorities may issue  orders\r\n\r\nto  management  councils of such slummy  buildings  to  maintain\r\n\r\nproperly or to face court proceedings.  And if they persistently\r\n\r\nrefuse  or fail to do so, then condemnation orders can be served\r\n\r\nor the management corporation may be dissolved.  So I do not see\r\n\r\nthis  strongly as a matter of public interest.   It  is  more  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  that  majority in the building of  private  owners\r\n\r\nagainst a minority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certainly true that under the present law, many may\r\n\r\nbe  frustrated.   Some  have called  this  the  tyranny  of  the\r\n\r\nminority.  I believe the Minister of State used this term in  an\r\n\r\nearlier parliamentary sitting when he introduced the outline  of\r\n\r\nthe  present Bill.  But others did not see this as a tyranny but\r\n\r\nrather as a minority simply protecting their rights.  They point\r\n\r\nout that the majority is not stopped from selling their units if\r\n\r\nthey  choose  to  do so.  What they cannot  do  is  to  get  the\r\n\r\nwindfall  premium by selling en-bloc.  No one is  trapped  in  a\r\n\r\nbuilding but they are stopped from selling somebody else's house\r\n\r\nunder  them.   And I think in this sense, this is a  debate  not\r\n\r\nsimply  about  efficiency in land use,  about  abstract  rights.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a debate about the idea of Singapore as our home.   We\r\n\r\nhave  encouraged home ownership.  We wish that Singaporeans feel\r\n\r\nthat the nation is their home, their permanent home which no one\r\n\r\ncan  take  from  them.   Of  course,  this  is  best  served  by\r\n\r\nallegiance to the nation as a whole.  At our National Day, I  am\r\n\r\nsure many people will feel that allegiance.  But on normal days,\r\n\r\nin  our  dreams, in our thoughts, in our hearts, that  sense  of\r\n\r\nrootedness  of  home  belongs  to  one's  specific  home,  one's\r\n\r\nspecific  neighbourhood.  And in many ways I think that  is  why\r\n\r\nprivate property in Singapore has demanded a premium not  merely\r\n\r\nfor the facilities or the quality - the HDB quality is going  up\r\n\r\nall  the  time - it is for that idea that this home is a private\r\n\r\nproperty belonging to me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I do not agree that condominiums are about\r\n\r\ncommunal living.  The way I look at it is what is common is very\r\n\r\nsmall.  If we ask ourselves: can somebody\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  vote  at  the management committee invite them to  my  front\r\n\r\ndoor,  I think the answer is no.  If the answer to an invitation\r\n\r\nto  the  front door is no, then how can it be that the  majority\r\n\r\ncan also sell out not just my front door but my whole house from\r\n\r\nunder me?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I want to distinguish between this idea of public\r\n\r\ninterest  and the majority in a private building and,  secondly,\r\n\r\nthe  idea  of  communal  living  against  the  idea  of  private\r\n\r\nproperty.  As I said also, there is an emotional attachment to a\r\n\r\nhome  and this is very difficult to translate purely to monetary\r\n\r\nterms.  As such, I share the concern many Members have expressed\r\n\r\nthat  the  conditions  of  a  bona fide  sale  at  arm's  length\r\n\r\ntransaction  are  simply not enough.  The  attachment  which  an\r\n\r\nolder  member may feel for his or her home of 20 years would  be\r\n\r\nconsidered   irrelevant   in   this   equation.    This   is   a\r\n\r\nmonetarisation of emotional attachment and that idea is contrary\r\n\r\nto the idea of Singapore as home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many personal reasons for preferring not to sell.\r\n\r\nIt  includes circumstances like the owner, such as an elderly or\r\n\r\nill person, who may not be able to stomach the idea of having to\r\n\r\npack  everything  and  move.  There is a convenience  factor  of\r\n\r\nbeing  near  to other family members or the school or amenities,\r\n\r\nor  to  simply  a  neighbourhood with which  you  are  familiar.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,   there  are  hard  economic  reasons   for   some\r\n\r\npreferring  not to sell.  The purchase price paid  by  different\r\n\r\nowners at different times may vary considerably.  For example, a\r\n\r\ncondominium unit that fetched, say, a quarter million dollars in\r\n\r\n1986  or  1987  may cost by 1990 some $400,000, and  then  1994,\r\n\r\nperhaps at the height or later, to fetch $1 million for the same\r\n\r\nunit,  more or less.  As such, if an en-bloc sale results  in  a\r\n\r\nprice  of  $1.1 million, say, to all the buyers, the  profit  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  owners would differ considerably.  And so  they  have\r\n\r\ndifferent incentives to sell.  This is a rational decision,  not\r\n\r\nan  emotional one.  This is a hard dollar and cent reason for us\r\n\r\nto  help  people hang on to their properties and not  have  them\r\n\r\npried out from their hands.  And, of course, I do not think this\r\n\r\nHouse needs to remember that in the present\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarket where prices are lower than the peak, it could result  in\r\n\r\na loss.  I am gratified that the Minister of State now says that\r\n\r\nwe  guarantee that deals do not go through if they result  in  a\r\n\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to my third point that more safeguards are\r\n\r\nneeded.  I share Prof. Chin's concerns that it is the court  who\r\n\r\nis much more appropriate to fathom the mixture of personal loss,\r\n\r\neconomic  loss, rather than the Strata Titles Board.  And  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  echo  the sentiments expressed by my fellow NMP Mr  Rai.  I\r\n\r\nalso  share  the concern that if we are to consider any  factors\r\n\r\nput  forward by anyone, this is not in the Bill as  drafted.   I\r\n\r\nthink  we  have  to  consider this particularly  because,  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  them, en-bloc proposals may differ considerably  not\r\n\r\njust  in  terms  of price but also in additional terms  such  as\r\n\r\npreferential treatment for new apartment once it is built, rent-free  periods - all these differ from deal to deal -  and  there\r\n\r\nmust  be room for the Board or the court to fully consider these\r\n\r\nreasons  as well as the price.  I also noted the Bill,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State has emphasised mediation.  But I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthis  mediation  is  not sufficient because  if  it  fails,  the\r\n\r\nmajority can still rely on the price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the concern about the timeframes regarding the 10-year properties and the voting percentages outlined earlier by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister of State.  I wish to finally close on just  a  few\r\n\r\nbroader points or suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that when this Bill goes to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, I ponder who would speak for the minority owners.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  developers are well taken care of.   They  are  well\r\n\r\norganised and can speak with an equal and loud voice.  There has\r\n\r\nbeen  some  anecdotal evidence about Kim Lin Mansions  or  other\r\n\r\nisolated  cases.  The Minister has not shared with us  how  much\r\n\r\nfeedback, how many complaints.  And I would ask that the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee go beyond just being open to views but rather seek  to\r\n\r\nsurvey, study and genuinely solicit views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second wider suggestion I have is that the Bill be\r\n\r\nbetter served and the minority interest better protected if the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmajority  who wish to sell be placed in a fiduciary relationship\r\n\r\nto  the minority whereby undertaking the sale, they will take on\r\n\r\nduties  to  safeguard the interest of the minority  as  best  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and a more general point I wish the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  to put before the Select Committee is that, might it  not\r\n\r\nbe better not to exchange existing private rights, but rather to\r\n\r\nchange  them prospectively for land and developments  that  will\r\n\r\nnow  arise.   This  of  course has the  disadvantage  of  making\r\n\r\ndifferent  types of land and making choices more  complex.   But\r\n\r\nthis  has  the  advantage  of making sure  the  people  who  are\r\n\r\npresently  situated in one system of rights  do  not  find  that\r\n\r\nsystem changed to their adversity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I voice my unhappiness\r\n\r\nabout  the Bill.  A number of other speakers, particularly Prof.\r\n\r\nChin  and  the speaker following him and now Mr Simon Tay,  have\r\n\r\nvoiced  their concerns which I was going to voice, and so  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  propose to repeat them.  Suffice to say that I  think  they\r\n\r\nare  well-founded  and  these views  must  be  given  sufficient\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let us not make any pretence. This is not\r\n\r\na  case  of a minority or even a single man holding out  against\r\n\r\nthe  society.  It is not a question of society's interests  that\r\n\r\nwill be adversely affected if we give way to the man's wish  and\r\n\r\nfreedom to do what he wishes.  This Bill simply panders  to  the\r\n\r\ngreed of the developers and the other co-lessees who see, as has\r\n\r\nbeen  said, a way to get rich quickly.  That would appear to  be\r\n\r\nthe  only  reason  for this Bill.  There is no question  of  any\r\n\r\nnational  interests coming into this.  There  is,  as  has  been\r\n\r\npointed  out,  the Land Acquisition Act and even there,  let  me\r\n\r\nsay,  it  is  felt by many that that Act itself is being  abused\r\n\r\nfrom its primary, original purpose which was that it should only\r\n\r\nbe  used  for national interests; it is used for lots  of  other\r\n\r\nreasons now.  So let us not pretend that a minority, even if  it\r\n\r\nbe a single man, is holding society to ransom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adds another instance to the list that is already\r\n\r\ngrowing in Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhere  the  citizen is coerced.  He is coerced to  do  something\r\n\r\nagainst  his will, against his freedom to do what he  wishes  to\r\n\r\ndo.   Is  that the kind of society we want in Singapore where  a\r\n\r\ncitizen is coerced at every turn and corner?  Or is it a society\r\n\r\nwhere  the citizen feels that he is free to make his own  choice\r\n\r\nprovided of course it does not harm the society at large?  I  am\r\n\r\nsure the answer to that must be quite plain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to raise, and that has been\r\n\r\nraised by Prof. Chin, is why cannot we allow or ask the majority\r\n\r\nof the owners to take their application to court.  What is wrong\r\n\r\nwith  the  courts  hearing it?  Then at least we  have  an  open\r\n\r\npublic  hearing.  We will have representations on behalf of  the\r\n\r\nminority and we will hear representations from the majority.  In\r\n\r\na  hearing  before the Strata Titles Board, we do not  get  this\r\n\r\nopenness  and we may not even get a reasoned decision  from  the\r\n\r\nBoard  when they do come to make a decision.  But the courts  do\r\n\r\nhave  to give their decision.  So is it not more preferable that\r\n\r\nthis  matter should be left to the courts?  After all, they  are\r\n\r\nvested  with  the judicial power in this country and  we  should\r\n\r\nallow  them  to function in the role that they are  intended  to\r\n\r\nfunction and not keep taking away from the courts their function\r\n\r\nand  giving  it to statutory boards and civil servants  and  the\r\n\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My objection to this Bill is on principle. I think it is\r\n\r\nwrong  to force one man to give up his property.  I do not  want\r\n\r\nto  go  into  the reasons why he may be against the sale.   Some\r\n\r\nreasons  have  been  advanced but whatever  it  is,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nprinciple.  Do we rob a man or woman, as the case may be, of his\r\n\r\nor  her  freedom  to do what he or she wishes  to  do  with  the\r\n\r\nproperty?  Why is that necessary in Singapore?  As I said, in  a\r\n\r\nnumber of things, citizens are now being coerced.  I think there\r\n\r\nshould be a limit to this coercion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to join\r\n\r\nin this debate.  I am surprised, Sir, that the Government should\r\n\r\nsuccumb  to  the  greed of property owners  and  take  away  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunanimity  in  regard to en-bloc sales.  In 1987,  at  the  last\r\n\r\nmajor  amendment to the Land Titles (Strata) Act, the Government\r\n\r\nheld  firm to the principle of unanimity as regards the sale  of\r\n\r\nthe  whole  development comprised in a Strata Title  plan.   Why\r\n\r\nshould the Government now make a complete about turn and go back\r\n\r\non its own belief?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the principle of unanimity is correct and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should hold on to it.  The principle  has  been\r\n\r\nupheld  by  the Government up till now because it believes  that\r\n\r\nthe  minority interests must be protected.  There will  normally\r\n\r\nbe  a few people who live in a large block of private flats  who\r\n\r\ndo  not want to be moved out.  These people are not spoilers  or\r\n\r\npeople  who  want to hold the other flat owners  to  ransom  and\r\n\r\ndemand  high prices for their own units.  They just do not  want\r\n\r\nto move out whatever the going price is paid to them.  I know of\r\n\r\nsuch  instances in a private development where an  en-bloc  sale\r\n\r\nwas  proposed.  Each flat owner was offered about $1 1/2 million\r\n\r\nas  compensation.  Those flats were first purchased in 1969  for\r\n\r\nonly  about $27,000 each.  So the price of $1 1/2 million was  a\r\n\r\nwindfall.  It was like touching a lottery.  But there  were  two\r\n\r\nladies  who refused to sell their units.  Those two flat  owners\r\n\r\ndid  not ask for more money.  The compensation paid to them  was\r\n\r\nnot  an  issue.   They just do not want to  move  out  and  live\r\n\r\nsomewhere else.  Many people of course will call them stupid  or\r\n\r\nunable  to  comprehend  them for refusing  such  large  sums  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  money.   But if we value  freedom  and  value  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  that  one has a right to live where one  chooses  for\r\n\r\nwhatever reasons, then I believe we can start to understand  the\r\n\r\nrefusal  of  those  two  ladies to budge from  their  places  of\r\n\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, one is only forced to move out of one's home in\r\n\r\ntimes  of  war,  or  in  times  of  natural  disaster  like   an\r\n\r\nearthquake, or where there is a widespread contagious disease in\r\n\r\nthe   community,  or  one's  property  is  required  for  public\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Other than those instances, I do not think that in\r\n\r\na  civilised  society, one should be forced to be  evicted  from\r\n\r\none's own private property against one's own\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill.   The governments of other countries may want to do it  to\r\n\r\ntheir  own  citizens.  But I do not think that we should  follow\r\n\r\nthem.   If a property owner wants to make money out of  his  own\r\n\r\nproperty, he is entirely free to do so.  But I do not think that\r\n\r\nhe  has  a  right to drag other residents into his  money-making\r\n\r\nscheme if the other residents do not want to have a hand in it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a society must have some ideals, some principles to\r\n\r\nhang  on to.  If a society has no principles, no ideals at  all,\r\n\r\nthat  society, for the short term, may prosper but in  the  long\r\n\r\nrun, it shall surely collapse.  I cannot accept the belief of  a\r\n\r\nwell-known businessman in Singapore when he said that everything\r\n\r\nis up for sale except his own wife.  I am certain we do treasure\r\n\r\ncertain  things  which  cannot be sold  whatever  is  the  price\r\n\r\noffered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expediency as a philosophy is not a good philosophy for our\r\n\r\nnation.  The American nation, despite its commitment to business\r\n\r\nand  seeming  expedient ways, has endured for  over  200  years,\r\n\r\nbecause  it still holds on to certain sacred beliefs and  ideals\r\n\r\nas enshrined in its constitution.  As for Singapore, it must not\r\n\r\nthrow  all ideals and principles to the wind.  For me, I believe\r\n\r\nin the sacrosanctity of my home.  I should be allowed to stay in\r\n\r\nit  as  long as I like.  I therefore cannot support a law  which\r\n\r\nwill  allow  others to force me out of my home all because  they\r\n\r\nwant is to make more money out of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me thank the\r\n\r\nmany speakers who have spoken.  Since the Bill will be going  to\r\n\r\na   Select  Committee,  I  will  not  address  all  the  points,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  technical ones which can be considered  at  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee.  However, Sir, I should take this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  outline  the  reasons  why the  Government  has  taken  this\r\n\r\napproach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated by many Members, the underlying objective of the\r\n\r\nBill  is  recognising land is scarce in Singapore and  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  the  plot ratios of many developments have been  enhanced,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a need to facilitate the realisation of more  housing\r\n\r\nunits  for Singaporeans.  We are talking in many cases of  prime\r\n\r\nareas, freehold, 999\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyears.   From  the records that are available, some developments\r\n\r\nhave  yielded  two to three times more units for ourselves,  for\r\n\r\nour  children.  So this is a step that we take which  will  have\r\n\r\nlong term impact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as many Members have stated, yes, indeed we are\r\n\r\ndealing with property rights that can be sensitive.  But I think\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  also understand that in land scarce Singapore,  we\r\n\r\nshould not flinch from taking measures that are necessary  which\r\n\r\nwill  benefit both Singapore and Singaporeans, which  indeed  we\r\n\r\ndid  in  the  1960s when we introduced land acquisition.   These\r\n\r\nland  acquisition  policies  have facilitated  and  resulted  in\r\n\r\ndevelopments that have made Singapore one of the best cities  in\r\n\r\nthe world.  Of course, some Members may say that the example may\r\n\r\nnot be quite the same.  But I would argue that there is a public\r\n\r\ninterest element, not just in land acquisition but also  in  en-bloc  sale.   Let  us not forget that, unlike  land  acquisition\r\n\r\nwhere  a  person's  property  is  acquired,  he  may  lose   out\r\n\r\nfinancially, the distinguishing factor here is that  in  an  en-bloc   sale,  the  minority  owner  would  very  often   benefit\r\n\r\nsubstantially financially.  That is the first point  I  want  to\r\n\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which we should also bear in mind is that,\r\n\r\nlike I have said in my speech, the new scheme will not apply  to\r\n\r\nlanded properties, even though one of the Members had urged  for\r\n\r\nit  to be applied to terrace houses.  I think the difference  is\r\n\r\nfundamental  and this is one point that perhaps Singaporeans  do\r\n\r\nnot  fully grasp, the legal significance of buying a condominium\r\n\r\nwhere  what  a person buys into is a strata lot.  He  buys  into\r\n\r\ncommon  property.   He  is  designated share  values  in  common\r\n\r\nproperty.    He  has no specific land lot.  He  has  got  strata\r\n\r\nrights, essentially enjoyment of the air space where his unit is\r\n\r\nlocated.   So  what the majority want to do, in  effect,  is  to\r\n\r\nexercise their rights over the common property.  If there are 99\r\n\r\nowners in a 100-owner development, assuming the share values are\r\n\r\nequal  and equal area also, what the 99 owners say is, \"We  want\r\n\r\nto  exercise  our rights to sell this strata development\"  where\r\n\r\nevery owner\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwho  comes into this development, unlike buying landed property,\r\n\r\nknows what he is going in for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, of course, is besides just the legal\r\n\r\nnature,  one  cannot understate the fact of communal  living  in\r\n\r\nstrata  development.   And this is another point, which is  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  over  time will better understand  what  the  Land\r\n\r\nTitles (Strata) Act is all about.  It is a complex Act with  130\r\n\r\nsections.   Why?  Because living in a condominium  is  not  just\r\n\r\nbuying  your  own property and living away from everybody  else.\r\n\r\nThere  are legal duties; there are legal liabilities.  And  that\r\n\r\nis  why  a  management corporation is formed in all developments\r\n\r\nwith  powers over many areas.  So this is the other point  which\r\n\r\nwe should note.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have talked about the 10-year rule. Our approach,\r\n\r\nas I said in my speech, is not to dictate which developments are\r\n\r\nripe  for en-bloc sale.  We leave it essentially to the  owners.\r\n\r\nSo  there is minimum intervention, unlike Mr Simon Tay  who  had\r\n\r\nasked  why we do not stipulate terms and conditions in the  sale\r\n\r\nand purchase agreement.  We take a non-interventionist approach.\r\n\r\nI  think  the starting point is that we leave it to the majority\r\n\r\nowners.   If  80%-90%,  all  like minded,  all  with  their  own\r\n\r\nfaculties  to decide what is best, say that this is the  way  to\r\n\r\ngo,  provided,  of course, the transaction is at  arm's  length,\r\n\r\nthere is no collusion, then the sale goes ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I just want to clarify that I did not\r\n\r\nmean  that  I  was encouraging the Bill to allow stipulation  of\r\n\r\nterms  and  conditions.  I was only pointing out that terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions in different en-bloc offers do differ, which may then\r\n\r\nhave to be considered by the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Thank you for the clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, going on this basic objective of creating more space\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans, we have decided on the 10-year rule.  Going on\r\n\r\npresent records, it will not lead to national wastage.   One  or\r\n\r\ntwo speakers had asked whether the 10-year rule, where\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  buildings are relatively new, would lead to wastage at  the\r\n\r\nnational  level.  From the records, only about  20%  of  en-bloc\r\n\r\ndevelopments  have  been less than 10 years.   Nevertheless,  we\r\n\r\nalso  know  that  there  may be good reasons  why  owners  in  a\r\n\r\ndevelopment which is less than 10 years would want to  sell  en-bloc.   It  could  be because the plot ratio has  been  enhanced\r\n\r\nsubstantially.  It could be because the development is next to a\r\n\r\nvacant  plot  of  land and there is reason to sell  it  so  that\r\n\r\ndevelopment can be built on a larger piece of land.   Or  it  is\r\n\r\nnext  to another development which is perhaps also less than  10\r\n\r\nyears old, but it makes economic sense to sell it together.   As\r\n\r\nthe  approach  we take is to facilitate en-bloc  sale,  we  have\r\n\r\nadopted the 10-year rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew says that this will mean that it goes against\r\n\r\nanother  objective which is to rejuvenate estates.   That  is  a\r\n\r\nsecondary objective. In time to come, when estates become older,\r\n\r\nI think this will come to the forefront.  But at the moment, the\r\n\r\nprimary  objective is to help realise enhanced  plot  ratios  so\r\n\r\nthat many more homes can be created for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other big area that we looked at was the role of the\r\n\r\nStrata Titles Board.  I think, like I have said in my speech, it\r\n\r\nis  an  important safeguard.  The Strata Titles  Board  will  be\r\n\r\nenhanced.   There  will be more members.   And  as  Mr  Rai  has\r\n\r\nrightly  pointed  out, based on personal experience,  the  Board\r\n\r\ncomprises  senior professionals in the various fields which  are\r\n\r\nrelevant  to what the Strata Titles Board will have to  do,  not\r\n\r\ndecide  on the law, but decide on whether the sale price is  one\r\n\r\nwhere   there  is  no  collusion,  decide  on  the   method   of\r\n\r\ndistribution, whether it is unfair to the minority owners.   The\r\n\r\ncomposition  of the panel will ensure that this task  is  better\r\n\r\ndone, rather than a judge sitting in court fettered by the rules\r\n\r\nof evidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, of course, I think Mr Rai again brings it\r\n\r\nout  poignantly  is the mediatory role of the Board, which again\r\n\r\na  court will be less suited to do.  In a more informal setting,\r\n\r\nthe Board takes a mediation role.  That is very critical.  As  I\r\n\r\nhave said in my speech and Mr Rai, based\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  his experience, has also backed up, in many cases, the Board\r\n\r\nwill  mediate.   In many cases, they will succeed in  mediation.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, people who may not want to sell, especially those\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  based on financial reasons, if there  is  skilful\r\n\r\nmediation, if the parties, especially the majority parties,  are\r\n\r\nencouraged  to give some latitude to the minority owners,  maybe\r\n\r\narrange,  if  a  person  wants to live  in  the  area,  for  the\r\n\r\ndeveloper  to give a right of first refusal, so that he  or  she\r\n\r\ncan  continue  staying in the area, relocation  or  whatever,  I\r\n\r\nthink many of these problems can be settled.  The Board will  be\r\n\r\nmuch better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I want to say is that I would agree\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  not  typecast majority  and  minority  owners,\r\n\r\nbecause there are minority owners who may not want to sell based\r\n\r\non  financial  reasons.  Yes, there will also be other  minority\r\n\r\nowners  who, because of emotional or sentimental attachment,  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to move.  Therefore, I would agree that we should  not\r\n\r\nfix  them with the term \"tyranny of the minority\".  When I  used\r\n\r\nit   in  this  House  in  the  earlier  debate,  it  is  not  to\r\n\r\ncharacterise  them  with a slur, but to describe  the  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  one  person  saying no will prevent the transaction  from\r\n\r\ngoing  through.   In  this sense, it is one  person's  objection\r\n\r\nwhich  has prevented the realisation of the desires of the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the corollary to that is that we should not characterise\r\n\r\nmajority  owners, which has been done in this House  by  several\r\n\r\nspeakers,  that they are greedy, they are avaricious,  all  they\r\n\r\nwant  is  to  make  money.  I think it is not fair  on  majority\r\n\r\nowners, if it is what they are waiting for.  But it does  happen\r\n\r\nthat  Government's  actions  result in  certain  people  getting\r\n\r\nricher, getting a windfall.  So shall we begrudge that?  I would\r\n\r\nsay  no.   Shall  we facilitate it?  Well, if it  results  in  a\r\n\r\npublic  interest being met, which is the creation of more  homes\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans, a lot of them in prime freehold areas, then  I\r\n\r\nwill   say  yes,  provided,  of  course,  there  are  sufficient\r\n\r\nsafeguards,  and  the interests of all parties  are  taken  into\r\n\r\naccount.   And this indeed is the approach we take in the  Bill,\r\n\r\nif you look at the specific\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncriteria in the Bill  taking into account all the objections  of\r\n\r\nthe  minority,  all  the circumstances  of  the  case,  all  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, part of the basic approach is that we know\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  be  difficult to go away from  basic  objective\r\n\r\ncriteria.   That is why I said in my speech earlier on  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, that the primary function of the tribunal would be to see\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  an  arm's  length transaction,  bona  fide,  no\r\n\r\ncollusion  and so forth.  But, at the same time,  there  may  be\r\n\r\nexceptional circumstances.  I have mentioned one, which is  that\r\n\r\nno party should lose out financially.  If you sell your property\r\n\r\nat  a  loss  or you sell your property and you cannot redeem  it\r\n\r\nwith  the  bank,  then  it will be a ground  for  the  Board  to\r\n\r\nintervene.  So let us take that approach and see how  the  Board\r\n\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will go to a Select Committee. So I do not\r\n\r\nthink  I  need to go into the details.  I want to thank  Members\r\n\r\nfor   their  many  suggestions.   Some  of  them  are  technical\r\n\r\nsuggestions to improve the working of the Board, to improve  the\r\n\r\nworking  of  the  Bill, which can be considered  at  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, the Minister of State seems to base his\r\n\r\nmain ground on land scarcity in Singapore.

Opportunity is also  taken  to\r\n\r\nincorporate four other amendments to the Income Tax Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin with the tax changes announced in the Budget\r\n\r\nStatement.   There are a total of 11 tax changes  which  require\r\n\r\namendment  to the Act.  I have introduced a number  of  new  tax\r\n\r\nincentives in the 1998 Budget and they are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a tax concession to promote the bond market;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a tax concession package to help Singapore develop as an\r\n\r\nelectronic commerce hub;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) tax exemption on income for approved insurance companies\r\n\r\nderiving from writing offshore marine hull and liability\r\n\r\ninsurance;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) tax exemption on income derived from uplift of freight\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) one-year accelerated depreciation allowance for\r\n\r\ncompanies  which acquire approved equipment or technology  which\r\n\r\nmeet  certain  criteria relating to noise and chemical  exposure\r\n\r\nlevels and, finally,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) a further tax deduction to companies for approved\r\n\r\nrelocation  and recruitment expenses incurred in the  hiring  of\r\n\r\ntalent from abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5, 6, 11, 13, 17 and 20 amend the Act to provide\r\n\r\nfor these incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also announced the extension and liberalisation of\r\n\r\nseveral  existing tax concessions.  Clauses 3 to 5, 7,  10,  12,\r\n\r\n14, 16, and 21 amend the Act to provide for the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) extension of the tax holiday granted to the Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational Monetary Exchange Limited (SIMEX) for another five\r\n\r\nyears;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) extension of the current 10-year limit for venture\r\n\r\ncapital  funds  to  enjoy tax exemption on the  gains  from  the\r\n\r\ndisposal of investments, for a further five years;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) extension and liberalisation of the Tax Exemption\r\n\r\nScheme   for   Syndicated  Offshore  Credit   and   Underwriting\r\n\r\nFacilities for a further five years;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) liberalisation of the tax concession for the unit trust\r\n\r\nindustry; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) removal of the yearly restrictions in the tax deduction\r\n\r\nlimits for general provisions made by banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Changes Not Announced in the 1998 Budget Statement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the four tax changes that were not\r\n\r\nannounced in the 1998 Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tax change pertains to tax deduction for donation\r\n\r\nof  computer  equipment.   At  present,  companies  that  donate\r\n\r\ncomputer equipment to educational and research institutions  are\r\n\r\nallowed a tax deduction equal to the value of the donation.  The\r\n\r\nscheme is to encourage companies to donate computer equipment to\r\n\r\nthese institutions to help them upgrade and maintain the quality\r\n\r\nof  information technology training at the forefront.  To enable\r\n\r\nother  organisations to also keep pace with the developments  in\r\n\r\ninformation  technology,  I  have  decided  to  extend  the  tax\r\n\r\ndeduction  scheme to include donation of computer  equipment  to\r\n\r\npublic   libraries,  community  centres  and  voluntary  welfare\r\n\r\norganisations.  Clause 15 amends section 37(2)  of  the  Act  to\r\n\r\nprovide for this extension.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tax change relates to the promotion of trading of\r\n\r\nSingapore  goods and services.  Currently, double tax  deduction\r\n\r\nis  granted for expenses incurred in the promotion of  Singapore\r\n\r\ngoods and services.  As the current\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovision  in the Act is rather restrictive with regard  to  the\r\n\r\ntype and extent of expenses incurred that would qualify for  the\r\n\r\ndouble tax deduction, clause 8 amends section 14B of the Act  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for more flexibility in order to encourage the  trading\r\n\r\nof Singapore goods and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third tax change relates to the tax incentives I\r\n\r\nannounced  in  the  1995 Budget to promote offshore  leasing  of\r\n\r\naircraft.    Under  the  incentive  package,  aircraft   leasing\r\n\r\ncompanies   that  operate  from  Singapore  are   taxed   at   a\r\n\r\nconcessionary rate of 10% on their income derived from  offshore\r\n\r\naircraft  leasing.   To  further  boost  the  attractiveness  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as a location for aircraft leasing companies,  I  have\r\n\r\ndecided to extend the tax concession to cover the income derived\r\n\r\nby  approved aircraft leasing companies from aircraft management\r\n\r\nactivities.  Clause 19 amends section 43I of the Act to  provide\r\n\r\nfor this extension.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last change is to improve tax administration.\r\n\r\nAt  present, the Act requires a person carrying on  a  trade  or\r\n\r\nbusiness to issue receipts and maintain records of such receipts\r\n\r\nissued for tax purposes.  However, the Act also provides for the\r\n\r\nComptroller  of  Income  Tax to waive  such  a  requirement  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses  such as fast food restaurants where the turnover  is\r\n\r\nhigh  but the value of each transaction is low, subject  to  the\r\n\r\ncompany  being able to satisfy certain conditions.  For ease  of\r\n\r\nadministration, clause 2 amends section 2 of the Act  to  enable\r\n\r\nthe  Comptroller of Income Tax to delegate the power to  approve\r\n\r\nsuch   requests  to  the  Deputy  Comptroller  or  an  Assistant\r\n\r\nComptroller of Income Tax.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment,\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MERCHANT SHIPPING (CIVIL LIABILITY AND</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>COMPENSATION FOR OIL POLLUTION) BILL</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to give effect to the International\r\n\r\nConvention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992 (CLC\r\n\r\n92) and the International Convention on the Establishment of  an\r\n\r\nInternational Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage  in\r\n\r\n1992   (Fund  92).   Both  Conventions  were  adopted   by   the\r\n\r\nInternational Maritime Organization.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil\r\n\r\nPollution Damage 1969 (CLC 69) and  the International Convention\r\n\r\non  the  Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation\r\n\r\nfor  Oil  Pollution Damage 1971 (Fund 71) set the  international\r\n\r\nrules  and procedure for dealing with liability and compensation\r\n\r\nfor  oil  pollution damage. These Conventions  provide  for  the\r\n\r\nsharing of the costs of compensation between the shipowners  and\r\n\r\ncargo  interests. Compensation is initially paid by  the  owner,\r\n\r\nwhom  the CLC 69 makes strictly liable for oil pollution damage.\r\n\r\nSince  CLC  69  also  generally provides for limitation  of  the\r\n\r\nowner's  liability,  additional compensation  is  available,  if\r\n\r\nneeded,  from the International Oil Pollution Compensation  Fund\r\n\r\n(the  1971  Fund),  established under  Fund  71.   The  Fund  is\r\n\r\nfinanced by contributions from importers and receivers of oil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been a party to CLC 69 for many years. The\r\n\r\nexisting  1981 Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution) Act  implements\r\n\r\nthis Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the CLC 69 and Fund 71 have been found to be inadequate\r\n\r\nto  meet current levels of claims. In 1992, the IMO adopted  two\r\n\r\nProtocols  to amend CLC 69 and Fund 71. The Protocols  primarily\r\n\r\nraised  the level of compensation that victims of oil  pollution\r\n\r\ncan  claim as a result of an oil pollution from ships. Under CLC\r\n\r\n92, the limit of compensation has been raised\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  about S$30 million (in CLC 69) to about S$130 million,  or\r\n\r\nslightly  more  than four times.  Under Fund 92,  the  limit  of\r\n\r\ncompensation has been raised from about S$130 million  (in  Fund\r\n\r\n71) to about S$436 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of oil imported to and exported from Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  been increasing steadily over the years. A large number  of\r\n\r\nvery  large crude carriers (VLCCs) transit the Singapore Strait.\r\n\r\nAs  the  maritime  traffic  in our  waters  and  in  the  Strait\r\n\r\nincreases, so too does the risk of a serious pollution incident.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  if  Members may recall, such an  incident  did  occur\r\n\r\nrecently  in October 1997 when two oil tankers collided  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Strait spilling some 28,000 tons of crude oil into our\r\n\r\nwaters.  We would like to have a higher limit of compensation in\r\n\r\nthe event of a serious pollution incident like this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MPA consulted various public and private sector\r\n\r\norganizations   involved   such  as   the   Singapore   Shipping\r\n\r\nAssociation,  oil  industry, TDB, EDB and  MTI.  They  have  all\r\n\r\nsupported  Singapore's  accession to  the  Protocols.  Singapore\r\n\r\nacceded  to  CLC  92  and  Fund 92 on 18th  September  and  31st\r\n\r\nDecember 1997 respectively.  These will come into force one year\r\n\r\nlater.   In  other  words, in September and December  this  year\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our accession to CLC 92 means that Singapore-registered oil\r\n\r\ntankers  will have to be covered by insurance against  liability\r\n\r\nfor  oil  pollution damage for a higher limit  of  compensation.\r\n\r\nFurther,  tankers calling at Singapore must also be  insured  to\r\n\r\nthe  same  higher limit.   Our accession to Fund 92 will  enable\r\n\r\nvictims  of oil pollution damage to seek additional compensation\r\n\r\nwhere   compensation  from  shipowners  or  their  insurers   is\r\n\r\ninsufficient to meet the claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a party to CLC 92 and Fund 92, Singapore is obligated to\r\n\r\ngive  effect to the provisions of these Conventions in its laws.\r\n\r\nThe Bill contains the essential provisions to give effect to CLC\r\n\r\n92  and  Fund 92. Administrative and procedural matters will  be\r\n\r\ndealt by subsidiary legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the higher compensation available to oil pollution\r\n\r\nvictims  which  I have just mentioned, there are  the  following\r\n\r\ndifferences  between the old Act, which implements CLC  69,  and\r\n\r\nthe Bill which implements CLC 92 and Fund 92:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 6 of the Bill, owners of ships not exceeding\r\n\r\n5,000 tons can limit their liability to a fixed sum of 3 million\r\n\r\nspecial drawing rights (SDRs).  This is equivalent to about  S$6\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 3 of the Bill, expenses incurred for\r\n\r\npreventive measures are recoverable even where no spill  of  oil\r\n\r\noccurs,  provided that there is a grave and imminent  threat  of\r\n\r\npollution damage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions of the Bill apply to pollution damage both in\r\n\r\nthe  territory (including the territorial sea) as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nexclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions of the Bill apply to spills from sea-going\r\n\r\nvessels  constructed or adapted to carry oil in bulk  as  cargo,\r\n\r\nwhether laden or unladen and apply to spills of bunker oil  from\r\n\r\nsuch ships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving effect to Fund 92, the Bill requires\r\n\r\ncontributions to be paid to the Fund by an importer or  receiver\r\n\r\nof  more  than  150,000  tons per year of  oil.  The  major  oil\r\n\r\ncompanies  and oil traders in Singapore will contribute  to  the\r\n\r\nFund.  The amount to be paid each year will depend on the number\r\n\r\nand  size of oil spills in the States party to the Fund 92,  the\r\n\r\namount  of claim that exceeds the limit of the CLC 92, the  cost\r\n\r\nand  expenses  of  administering the Fund and any  deficit  from\r\n\r\noperations in preceding years. The amount of contributions is to\r\n\r\nbe  fixed  by  the  Fund.  The Fund shall,  subject  to  certain\r\n\r\nprescribed  limits, be liable to any person  who  is  unable  to\r\n\r\nobtain  full  compensation  for oil pollution  damage  from  the\r\n\r\nshipowner  or  his  insurer  if the shipowner  is  incapable  of\r\n\r\nmeeting  the claim or the claim exceeds the limitation  fund  of\r\n\r\nthe owner established under clause 7.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the fines imposed for any\r\n\r\noffence  under the Bill and sums collected to be paid  into  the\r\n\r\nfunds  of the Authority. Payment of fines to MPA will enable  it\r\n\r\nto recover part of the clean\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nup  costs  for oil spills from unknown sources and investigation\r\n\r\nexpenses relating to pollution incidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to support this Bill.  This Bill  has  two  main\r\n\r\nparts:  one on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution and,  secondly,\r\n\r\non the accession to the International Oil Pollution Compensation\r\n\r\nFund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore as an international port and maritime centre\r\n\r\nshould subscribe to these two conventions and fund, which  serve\r\n\r\nto  limit liability to ship owners, and yet protect the interest\r\n\r\nof  the  countries  around the seas where the  pollution  occurs\r\n\r\narising  from  these ship operations.  As the  Minister  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  Singapore  has  been a signatory to  the  Civil  Liability\r\n\r\nConvention  of  1969,  which  was  convened  arising  from   the\r\n\r\nenvironmental  pollution and damage of the  \"Torrey  Canyon\"  in\r\n\r\n1967.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is to be welcomed. The question I want to ask is\r\n\r\nwhy  it took so long for us to be a signatory to it.  The  Civil\r\n\r\nLiability  Convention  (CLC) will  only  be  in  force  on  17th\r\n\r\nSeptember  1998.   In  this  period  since  the  Convention  was\r\n\r\noperational in the other more progressive countries, why were we\r\n\r\nso  slow  to  join  in?   In this period between  now  and  17th\r\n\r\nSeptember  1998, owners of vessels operating in our  waters  are\r\n\r\nexposed to liability because of the limitations of CLC  69.   We\r\n\r\nhave already experienced vessel collision like Orapin Global and\r\n\r\nEvoikos  in  October  1997, which caused  major  pollution.   So\r\n\r\ntechnically we are still exposed till 17th September 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the accession to this Convention 92 mean that our\r\n\r\nships  from  the  neighbouring countries will be  restricted  in\r\n\r\ntrade  around  our  waters  and our  port,  because  such  ships\r\n\r\nregistered   in  these  neighbouring  countries   may   not   be\r\n\r\nsignatories?   And  will  the  higher  insurance  premiums   and\r\n\r\nstandard  requirements imply that our port  will  be  less  open\r\n\r\nbecause it is more restrictive given the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhigher  stringency  for the regional vessels?   Will  this  have\r\n\r\nimplications  for  us  in  serving the regional  vessels  in  an\r\n\r\neconomically difficult period?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 of this Bill stipulates that Government ships be\r\n\r\nexempted from these regulations.  I can accept if it is  due  to\r\n\r\nmatters  of  war,  but  navy vessels  also  operate  within  our\r\n\r\ncongested waters around the port and around Singapore  and  they\r\n\r\nshould be equally liable for such pollutions if they are due  to\r\n\r\naccidents or through negligence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 7, subsection 3a(i), liability damages are\r\n\r\ndetermined  in  SDRs  (Special  Drawing  Rights)  expressed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollars.   My  question is:  why  must  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nexchange  be  determined by the date of judgement?   Bearing  in\r\n\r\nmind  that  such  damages extend into millions of  dollars,  and\r\n\r\njudgement and settlement can extend over years, should  not  the\r\n\r\nrate   of  exchange  between  SDRs  and  Singapore  dollars   be\r\n\r\ndetermined on the date of the event or the last closest rate  to\r\n\r\nreflect the real cost damages?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Fund Convention, it puts our importers of oil and\r\n\r\nrefineries  on  the need to contribute to this  Fund.   Does  it\r\n\r\naffect  the  competitiveness of our refineries or oil  importers\r\n\r\nwhen  other  refineries,  including state-owned  ones  in  other\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries, are not signatories?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Chay for supporting the\r\n\r\nBill.   He asks why is it that we took so long to operationalise\r\n\r\nthese  two conventions (CLC 92 and Fund 92).  Let me just  point\r\n\r\nout  that  although they were adopted by IMO in 1992 (hence  the\r\n\r\nname  CLC  92  and  Fund 92), both these conventions  have  only\r\n\r\nentered into force internationally in 1996, two years ago.   The\r\n\r\npractice is to have a minimum number of countries accede to  the\r\n\r\nprotocol  before  it comes into force.  It is  our  practice  to\r\n\r\naccede   to   these  conventions  after  it  comes  into   force\r\n\r\ninternationally.   When it did so in 1996, the  Government  then\r\n\r\nstarted  the  process  of consultation with  various  interested\r\n\r\nparties.   In  our  case,  of  course,  we  consulted  not  only\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies and Ministries, like MTI, TDB and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nso  on,  but also other relevant parties in Singapore  like  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Shipping Association (SSA), oil traders, oil  refiners\r\n\r\nand  so on.  That was done and completed last year and the  Fund\r\n\r\nwas  acceded to last year and will go into operation this  year.\r\n\r\nSo  I can assure the Member that there was no undue tardiness in\r\n\r\nthis area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what happens in between CLC 69 and CLC 92, in the\r\n\r\nperiod before CLC 92 comes into force, we are still governed  by\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of CLC 69.  If there are any pollution incidents\r\n\r\nthat  happen now, these will be covered by CLC 69.   The  Member\r\n\r\nmentioned the Evoikos incident.  I would like to inform him that\r\n\r\nbased on the estimates of the damage that has been caused by the\r\n\r\nEvoikos  incident, MPA is confident that the clean up cost  will\r\n\r\nbe  covered  or  met in full under CLC 69, the  old  convention.\r\n\r\nThis of course is due in no small part to the fact that MPA  and\r\n\r\nthe relevant agencies took swift and preventive action to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  damage was not unduly extensive.  CLC 69 coverage  is\r\n\r\nsufficient to cover any contingencies that we anticipate, if  we\r\n\r\nare  fully prepared for such emergency.  However, to be safe  we\r\n\r\nhave decided to accede to CLC 92.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asks about higher insurance premiums and\r\n\r\nwhat happens to ships of countries that do not accede to the CLC\r\n\r\n<br><br>92&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protocol.  Based on international convention, first of  all,\r\n\r\nships of countries that are party to CLC 92 will have no problem\r\n\r\nbecause  under that convention they are obligated, as Singapore-registered   ships  are,  to  obtain  the  necessary  insurance.\r\n\r\nHowever,  ships  which are not a party to CLC 92  will  need  to\r\n\r\nobtain  a  CLC 92 certificate to call at Singapore.   What  this\r\n\r\nmeans  is  that  they must obtain the necessary insurance  which\r\n\r\nwill  provide for the higher limits of indemnity required  under\r\n\r\nCLC  92.   In  actual fact, the Protection and  Indemnity  (P&I)\r\n\r\nclubs   that   insure  the  ships  and  provide  the   insurance\r\n\r\ncertificates informed us that most probably there will  be  very\r\n\r\nlittle  or  no  increase in premium for a CLC 92 certificate  as\r\n\r\ncompared to a CLC 69 certificate.  This means that there will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  very  little  cost  impact on ships  calling  on  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBecause  the  P&I  insurance cover today is already  very  high,\r\n\r\nthere  would  not  be any significant increase in  the  premiums\r\n\r\nwhich means therefore that the cost impact on ships will also be\r\n\r\nnegligible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are Government ships exempted? The two Protocols (CLC 92\r\n\r\nand  Fund 92) only apply to ships which are constructed for  the\r\n\r\ncarriage  of  oil  in bulk as cargo and also of  course  to  the\r\n\r\nspillage of bunker oil in the ships.  So if such a ship is owned\r\n\r\nby government, by a state, or by a state-owned company, then the\r\n\r\nconvention will apply to those types of government ships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay also asks why the conversion rate is set at the\r\n\r\ndate  of  judgement rather than at the date of event.   This  is\r\n\r\npart  of the international agreement that has been thrashed  out\r\n\r\nand settled among various countries.  There must be a reason why\r\n\r\nthey  have  set it at the date of judgement.  I am not  familiar\r\n\r\nwith  the  reason  why  that  has  been  so.   But  that  is  an\r\n\r\ninternational convention and Singapore is obliged to follow.  If\r\n\r\nhe  is interested, I can find out the reasons and respond  at  a\r\n\r\nlater date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on competitiveness of oil refineries and whether\r\n\r\nSingapore oil refineries will be affected in terms of high cost.\r\n\r\nAs I indicated earlier, before we acceded to this convention, we\r\n\r\ncanvassed  the opinion of all interested parties from Singapore,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  oil  refineries,  and  all  oil  companies  have\r\n\r\nexpressed  support  for this convention.  I  believe  major  oil\r\n\r\ncompanies in Singapore, they are multi-national companies,  find\r\n\r\nit  in  their  own  interest for Singapore  to  accede  to  this\r\n\r\nconvention.  Firstly, it means that they are actually  protected\r\n\r\nbecause  CLC 92 sets a cap on their liability; and, secondly,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  they  do  buy insurance,  they  contribute  to\r\n\r\nprivate   insurance  anyway.   So  the  contributions  to   this\r\n\r\nconvention would, I assume, be in lieu of contribution to  their\r\n\r\nown private insurance funds.  In that sense, I do not think that\r\n\r\nthere will be any major impact on their competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe those are the few questions that were raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONTROL OF PLANTS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.12 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control of Plants Act was enacted in 1994 to\r\n\r\nconsolidate legislation relating to plants and plant products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fulfil Singapore's obligations under the Agreement on\r\n\r\nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or  TRIPS\r\n\r\nAgreement,  the Inter-Ministry Committee on the TRIPS  Agreement\r\n\r\nrecommended legislative amendments to various Acts including the\r\n\r\nControl  of  Plants Act.  My Ministry and the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  (PPD)  have  taken this opportunity  to  review  and\r\n\r\nupdate the existing Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main changes to the Act concern three areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, regulating the import and transhipment of fresh fruits\r\n\r\nand vegetables to safeguard the health of humans;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, fulfilling Singapore's obligations under TRIPS and\r\n\r\nother WTO Agreements; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, improving PPD's operational effectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go through and explain the rationale of the\r\n\r\nthree main changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, regulating the trade in fresh fruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\nTo  address  increasing concerns about the safety  of  the  food\r\n\r\nSingapore imports, the Bill enhances the powers of the competent\r\n\r\nauthority to impose conditions on the transhipment and import of\r\n\r\nfruits and vegetables.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nStringent  controls  are also necessary to  protect  Singapore's\r\n\r\ntrade in plants and plant products.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions of the Act, PPD has no legal\r\n\r\npower  to  impose  or enforce any conditions on transhipment  of\r\n\r\nfresh  fruits  and  vegetables.  This poses a  potential  health\r\n\r\nhazard   as   such  products,  although  not  meant  for   local\r\n\r\nconsumption,  may  introduce harmful micro-organisms  and  pests\r\n\r\ninto Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of potential threats are E. coli 0157:H7, an\r\n\r\norganism  causing  severe food poisoning and  the  Mediterranean\r\n\r\nFruitfly, an insect that is detrimental to our trade in  fruits.\r\n\r\nTo  allow  PPD to impose sanitary controls, clause 2 provides  a\r\n\r\nnew  definition of \"tranship\" and clause 5 re-enacts Part II  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  to require a person who wishes to tranship  fruits  or\r\n\r\nvegetables  through Singapore to obtain a licence,  and  also  a\r\n\r\npermit   for   individual  consignments  of  fresh  fruits   and\r\n\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a need to enhance the competent authority's\r\n\r\ncontrol  on  imports of fruits and vegetables.   New  section  7\r\n\r\nrequires an import permit for individual consignments on top  of\r\n\r\nthe  licensing requirement in the existing Act.  With  the  two-tier  control system of licences and permits, PPD will have  the\r\n\r\nflexibility to impose and enforce conditions on both imports and\r\n\r\ntranshipments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under new section 30, PPD can restrict an import or\r\n\r\ntranshipment immediately by withholding the licence or permit in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  sources of fruits and vegetables when  evidence  is\r\n\r\nreceived  of any disease outbreaks or other hazards  related  to\r\n\r\nfruits  and  vegetables and which may be brought into  Singapore\r\n\r\nthrough  import  or  transhipment.   This  speed  of  action  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  as  the jet age has allowed goods to  be  transported\r\n\r\nbetween countries in a matter of hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to fulfilling Singapore's obligations to\r\n\r\nthe  various  WTO Agreements.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the  next  major\r\n\r\nfeature  is how to fulfil our obligations.  Firstly,  clause  6,\r\n\r\nincorporating  new sections 15A and 15B, is proposed  to  comply\r\n\r\nwith  our  obligations  set  out in  Article  39  of  the  TRIPS\r\n\r\nAgreement.  Under\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsection  15A, the Director of Primary Production is  obliged  to\r\n\r\ntake   reasonable   steps   to  protect   certain   confidential\r\n\r\ninformation  received  by him in relation  to  applications  for\r\n\r\nregistration  of  innovative  pesticides  and  not  to  use  the\r\n\r\ninformation  to  process other applications for registration  of\r\n\r\npesticides.  Section 15B describes the circumstances  where  the\r\n\r\nobligations under section 15A do not apply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the new sections 30(4) and 31(A) have been\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  fulfil  Singapore's obligations  under  the  WTO\r\n\r\nAgreement on Import Licensing Procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The WTO Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures places\r\n\r\ncertain   obligations  on  WTO  members  with  regard   to   the\r\n\r\nadministration   of   import   licensing   procedures.     These\r\n\r\nobligations  are  aimed primarily at promoting transparency  and\r\n\r\nfairness.   Section  30  requires the Director  to  provide  the\r\n\r\napplication with written reasons if he refuses to issue or renew\r\n\r\nthe licence or permit applied for under the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 31A allows any person aggrieved by the decision\r\n\r\nof  the  Director  regarding the grant, renewal,  suspension  or\r\n\r\nrevocation of a licence or permit, to appeal to the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry has also reviewed PPD's\r\n\r\ncurrent  operational needs.  Clauses 9 and 15 will  provide  PPD\r\n\r\nthe  flexibility  to  carry  out  its  operations  with  greater\r\n\r\neffectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow PPD to overcome resource constraints and focus its\r\n\r\nlimited  manpower  on  the  critical areas,  clause  9  proposes\r\n\r\namendments  to  section  26 to provide PPD  the  flexibility  to\r\n\r\noutsource less critical operations to the private sector.  These\r\n\r\noperations  include the inspection of plants and plant  products\r\n\r\nfor the issuance of phytosanitary certificates; and the analysis\r\n\r\nof imported fresh fruits and vegetables for contaminants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outsourcing of inspection for the issuance of\r\n\r\nphytosanitary  certificates is allowed under  the  International\r\n\r\nPlant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nProtection Convention which is the reference point for  the  WTO\r\n\r\non  international  standards, guidelines and recommendations  on\r\n\r\nplant health.  The United States has already taken advantage  of\r\n\r\nthis  provision  to  introduce  a  scheme  to  accredit  private\r\n\r\ncompanies to carry out such inspections.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With modern transportation methods allowing pests and\r\n\r\ndiseases  better  chances  of  surviving  international  travel,\r\n\r\nanother  critical  function of PPD  is  the  prevention  or  the\r\n\r\ncontainment  of  any  inadvertent  introduction  of  pests   and\r\n\r\ndiseases that could be detrimental to our plant trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operationally, PPD needs to enter private premises, such as\r\n\r\nfarms, nurseries and warehouses to detect pests and, if need be,\r\n\r\ncarry  out eradication tasks.  Based on data gathered, PPD would\r\n\r\nevaluate  the  impact on our trade in plants and plant  products\r\n\r\nand  decide  whether import restrictions should be  imposed  and\r\n\r\ntake  remedial  actions such as eradication  operations.   Early\r\n\r\ndetection  will provide us the opportunity to eradicate  a  pest\r\n\r\nbefore it is established.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current legislation presumes the entry of private premises\r\n\r\nby  authorised officers to carry out pest surveys.  In practice,\r\n\r\nif  permission is denied, no entry can be made.  Section  20  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  is therefore amended to give PPD powers to  enter  any\r\n\r\nland  or  premises  to conduct inspection surveys  in  order  to\r\n\r\nascertain the presence of pests and to gather the necessary data\r\n\r\nto  determine  the need, cost and scale of any pest eradication,\r\n\r\ncontrol or quarantine actions to be taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to address possible abuse of such powers, certain\r\n\r\nsafeguards have been built in.  Firstly, the officer must be  an\r\n\r\n\"authorised\" officer.  Secondly, the  inspections  can  only  be\r\n\r\ndone  at  reasonable times and only after giving a notice  under\r\n\r\nthe  hand of the Director at least six hours before the intended\r\n\r\nexercise  of  the power.  Thirdly, the inspecting  officer  must\r\n\r\nproduce  an  identification card, when  requested.   The  United\r\n\r\nStates and Canada have similar laws to empower their officers to\r\n\r\nenter premises for pest surveys and inspection.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Bill aims (1) to safeguard the health of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with respect to fresh fruits and vegetables brought\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore and protect our plant trade through the  control\r\n\r\nof  pests; (2) fulfil Singapore's WTO obligations; and (3) allow\r\n\r\nPPD to overcome resource constraints and focus its resources  on\r\n\r\nmore critical areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONTRIBUTION BY FOUNDING FATHERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> This motion is subject to the signification of\r\n\r\nsupport  by at least one other Member.

As we celebrate our independence, it is  timely  to\r\n\r\nrecall  and  recognise  the contribution made  by  our  founding\r\n\r\nfathers.   They fought for independence and built a progressive,\r\n\r\npeaceful  and prosperous Singapore.  Those of us who have  lived\r\n\r\nthrough  the  tumultuous  years  cannot  but  feel  a  sense  of\r\n\r\ngratitude.   How  we  made it to where we  are  today  has  been\r\n\r\ncompiled in about 36 minutes in a multi-media presentation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the opening ceremony, the Prime Minister asked\r\n\r\nme how I felt.  My reply was simple.  The Exhibition has been an\r\n\r\nemotional  journey  for most of us who have  lived  through  the\r\n\r\nperiod.  How we made it is a miracle.  Let me say this to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNational Heritage Board and to MITA: every dollar spent has been\r\n\r\nwell spent.  They have done well.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.26 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am moving this motion out of\r\n\r\nconviction to acknowledge a debt to those who have made us  what\r\n\r\nwe  are  and to convey to the generation to come that these  are\r\n\r\nprinciples   worthy  of  emulation.   Sir,  an  Indian   classic\r\n\r\nThirukural  says  it is not good to forget a benefit.   We  have\r\n\r\nbenefited a great deal, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principles which I have termed in this motion are\r\n\r\nprinciples worthy of following because without them, we will  be\r\n\r\ntorn  asunder.  I have discussed this motion with some  friends.\r\n\r\nThey  felt it was timely.  I agree with them.  Sir, this  motion\r\n\r\ndeals with founding fathers, but allow me also to deal with  our\r\n\r\nforefathers.  Before the British came to Singapore,  the  Malays\r\n\r\nwere  already  here.  Singapore was part of  the  Johor  empire.\r\n\r\nThey  came  from China, Indonesia, Malaya and India.  They  came\r\n\r\nnot  to  set up a home but to return to their homeland  after  a\r\n\r\nbrief sojourn, making some money.  Some died without even seeing\r\n\r\ntheir  families back home.  Many survived in colonial Singapore.\r\n\r\nSome of our forefathers went to their homeland and brought their\r\n\r\nfamilies  to  Singapore.  They lived a very frugal  and  spartan\r\n\r\nlife.   Their life was one of pain and suffering.  Through their\r\n\r\ntoil  and sweat, they built a place called Singapura, our  home,\r\n\r\ntheir legacy for the future generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we owe a debt to our pioneers that cannot be repaid.\r\n\r\nI  hope  in  years to come, we can name one of our  institutions\r\n\r\nafter  these  pioneers.  They deserve a lasting  memorial.   Our\r\n\r\nlocation has remained our greatest asset.  It is God's  gift  to\r\n\r\nus, no man can take this away from us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any natural resources, Sir, except its location and\r\n\r\nits  people, the island prospered under the British  rule.   The\r\n\r\nstrategic  location of this island attracted traders from  South\r\n\r\nEast Asia and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  For decades, life centred on trade.  More  and  more\r\n\r\nimmigrants made this island their home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with changing of the time, especially after the Second\r\n\r\nWorld  War,  the  political  landscape  underwent  change.    It\r\n\r\nawakened  national consciousness and our leaders  realised  that\r\n\r\nthey  had  to  be  masters  of their own  destiny.   The  Rendal\r\n\r\nConstitution  set  the tone for elected government  with  powers\r\n\r\nstill in the hands of the British government.  This was in 1955.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colonial office realised that the status quo could not\r\n\r\nbe maintained.  There were the student riots as well as the Hock\r\n\r\nLee  riots.  Things started changing.  Singapore attained  self-government in June 1959.  The PAP under the leadership of Mr Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew formed the first self-government.  In symbolic change,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Ministers  were sworn in City Hall  and  not  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  House.   Subsequently,  six  months  later,  on  3rd\r\n\r\nDecember, Encik Yusof Ishak took office as the first local  Head\r\n\r\nof State.  And it was a historic occasion, for the first time we\r\n\r\nsang  \"Majulah  Singapura\".   As a  student,  we  were  given  a\r\n\r\nnational loyalty card.  Sir, I still have this card and this  is\r\n\r\na symbol of our loyalty.  It reads, \"Majulah Singapura,  susunan\r\n\r\nkata dan lagu oleh Zubir Said.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we entered Malaysia in 1963 as a free people. We had\r\n\r\nto  leave  the  federation  in 1965 and  became  an  independent\r\n\r\nrepublic.   We  went  into Malaysia in the hope  of  building  a\r\n\r\nMalaysian nation, but we did not succeed.  We must never  forget\r\n\r\nour  stay in Malaysia which provided us a valuable lesson.  When\r\n\r\nwe  became  a Republic in 1965, we were not certain  as  to  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   The resolve by the leaders and the people has made  us\r\n\r\nsucceed against all odds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is men like Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Dr\r\n\r\nToh  Chin  Chye, Dr Goh Keng Swee, Mr S Rajaratnam, Mr Ong  Pang\r\n\r\nBoon,  Mr Lim Kim San, Mr E W Barker, Encik Othman Wok,  Mr  Hon\r\n\r\nSui  Sen  and  others we owe much.  We also  remember  Mr  David\r\n\r\nMarshall for his dream of Merdeka.  These men are representative\r\n\r\nof their time.  These men could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  lived a fairly comfortable life from any calling of  their\r\n\r\nchoice but they decided to help the people in building a modern,\r\n\r\nprosperous  Singapore.  They literally risked  their  lives  and\r\n\r\nlimbs for Singapore.  They were a product of history.  They knew\r\n\r\nwhat it was to be treated as a colonial people.  And let us hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  best  sons of Singapore would follow  these  leaders'\r\n\r\nfootsteps,  just not in the Administrative Service but  also  in\r\n\r\npolitics,  for our scholars must never forget that  they  owe  a\r\n\r\nduty and debt to society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can overcome the present and future difficulties\r\n\r\nprovided  we have the resolve.  In every society, the  cream  of\r\n\r\nthe  society  decides the fate of the community.   But  we  must\r\n\r\nnever  forget that there will be no cream without milk.   It  is\r\n\r\nequally  important for us to dedicate the course of our  society\r\n\r\nfrom which must come the leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, permit me to pay tribute to our civil service as well.\r\n\r\nPeople  like Mr Howe Yoon Chong, Mr Sim Kee Boon, Mr J Y  Pillay\r\n\r\nand  others who gave their best beyond the call of duty, for  no\r\n\r\nGovernment policy can succeed without a dedicated, honest, civil\r\n\r\nservice.   This House and the nation can be proud of  our  civil\r\n\r\nservants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also pay tribute to our citizens who worked hard, hand\r\n\r\nin  hand  with  the  Government, for no government  can  succeed\r\n\r\nwithout the support of the people.  We can overcome difficulties\r\n\r\nprovided we are firm in our resolve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, multi-racialism is a strong thread\r\n\r\nof  our  national  fabric, both for the  majority  and  minority\r\n\r\ncommunities;  in fact, all Singaporeans.  We must feel  at  home\r\n\r\nand  at  ease with each other.  In many countries, the so-called\r\n\r\nmulti-racialism is at best a dressing on the dining  plate.   In\r\n\r\nsome countries, minorities are persecuted, humiliated and suffer\r\n\r\nworst  indignities.  Our appeal to these countries is to respect\r\n\r\nand protect the minorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In multi-racial Singapore, our young children go to the\r\n\r\nsame  school,  share  the common goal and aspirations,  learning\r\n\r\neach  other's  culture and mix with each  other  easily.   These\r\n\r\nprinciples must be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncultivated,  but  we  cannot take them  for  granted.   We  must\r\n\r\nnurture them.  We must not just be tolerant.  Tolerance  to  me,\r\n\r\nSir, is very passive.  We must do more.  We must be active.   We\r\n\r\nmust respect each other's beliefs and traditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to language, Sir, language is a very sensitive\r\n\r\nissue.  We have chosen English as the medium of learning.  Malay\r\n\r\nis our national language.  We sing our national anthem in Malay.\r\n\r\nWe  have  decided  we  must learn our mother  tongue,  Mandarin,\r\n\r\nMalay, Tamil, Hindi, Punjabi and other Indian languages.   These\r\n\r\nlanguages  will  act  as  a  ballast,  to  quote  our  Education\r\n\r\nMinister,  RAdm  Teo Chee Hean.  These languages  will  help  us\r\n\r\npreserve  our  heritage.  Sir, the Government  is  committed  to\r\n\r\nnurturing  our  mother tongue and it is prepared to  change  its\r\n\r\npolicy whenever there is  merit in the proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving now to religious harmony, this is the most\r\n\r\nsensitive issue.  We have seen two riots which have religion  as\r\n\r\nthe  basis of civil disturbances.  Some of us felt very strongly\r\n\r\nand   made  representations  to  the  Select  Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nMaintenance of Religious Harmony Bill.  And we are grateful  for\r\n\r\nParliament in  passing this Bill that we have religious  harmony\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are a people of different races and different\r\n\r\nreligions.  We have only one dream, the dream to build Singapore\r\n\r\nwhere  people  live in peace.  The citizens have  pride  in  our\r\n\r\nnation.   Our  young must find it worthwhile to  stay  and  make\r\n\r\ntheir contribution to this country, their homeland.  I say  this\r\n\r\nbecause  in  many  countries, religious strife  has  harmed  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  the  country.  We have built an honest  and  stable\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Our people believe that there can be no  peace  and\r\n\r\nprosperity without a strong government.  It is essential to have\r\n\r\npolitical stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I end my speech with a reference to the Proclamation\r\n\r\nof Singapore.  Allow me to quote from the Proclamation:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As from the 9th day of August in the year One Thousand\r\n\r\nNine  Hundred  and  Sixty  Five Singapore  shall  be  forever  a\r\n\r\nsovereign, democratic and independent nation, founded  upon  the\r\n\r\nprinciples  of liberty and justice and ever seeking the  welfare\r\n\r\nand happiness of her people in a more just and equal society.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the House to support this motion, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, as an English-educated person, I wish to speak  in\r\n\r\nChinese  today  to  express the gratitude  I  feel  towards  the\r\n\r\ncontribution  of our founding fathers in establishing  a  multi-lingual  policy.  After all Chinese is my mother  tongue  and  a\r\n\r\nlanguage which I deeply enjoy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent economic crisis in all the Asian countries had\r\n\r\nnoticeable  ramifications at all levels.   The  tension  between\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Singapore is one example.  It arose due to economic\r\n\r\nand  historical  differences,  with  each  country  arguing  and\r\n\r\ndefending  its  own  ground.   The  persecution  of  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  was another painful and traumatic event,  heightening\r\n\r\nour awareness and anxiety toward inter-ethnic conflict.  Against\r\n\r\nthis  background, the recent National Education Exhibition which\r\n\r\nrelated   the  growth  of  Singapore  from  a  colony   to   its\r\n\r\nindependence   and  the  resilience  with  which  our   pioneers\r\n\r\nstruggled to build this country, truly won my admiration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Education Exhibition portrayed our society as\r\n\r\nmulti-racial,    multi-cultural   and    multi-lingual.     That\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  for  33  years  co-existed  in  harmony  and\r\n\r\ncollectively  worked hard to develop this nation  -  amidst  the\r\n\r\nthroes  of  vast  global transformations - is an  accomplishment\r\n\r\nwhich we must all cherish and feel proud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But can we sustain this hard-earned harmony through future\r\n\r\ngenerations  without  trouble?  The younger  Singaporeans  today\r\n\r\nhave  no  understanding of the 1964 racial riots and are  rather\r\n\r\nunaware about ethnic issues.  Does this point to the success  of\r\n\r\nour  multi-racial, multi-cultural and multi-lingual policy  that\r\n\r\nmade  \"race\"  not an issue at all or does it signal  a  lack  of\r\n\r\nsensitivity towards ethnic issues?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What concerns me are two issues: education and language.\r\n\r\nOur education policy created a group of elites such that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose  who  finally  entered tertiary  education  are  primarily\r\n\r\nChinese.   Even  among Primary and Secondary schools  achievers,\r\n\r\nChinese  in relative percentage terms still do better  than  the\r\n\r\nother  ethnic  groups.   I  do not think  this  is  due  to  any\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  policy adopted by the Government.   It  reflects\r\n\r\nmore  the  varying  attitudes toward education  among  different\r\n\r\nethnic  groups  and  the  lack  of adequate  resources  in  some\r\n\r\nfamilies  to  allow  the  children to complete  their  education\r\n\r\nsuccessfully.  As such, I reckon that what Singaporeans have  to\r\n\r\nbe   concerned  with  is  how  to  strengthen  and  elevate  the\r\n\r\neducational  attainment  levels  of  all  the  different  ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern is on the language issue. Till today,\r\n\r\nthere  are  still many Chinese Singaporeans who  share  negative\r\n\r\nviews  about Chinese culture and its transmission.  Despite  the\r\n\r\nopenness  which  the  Government has adopted  towards  the  four\r\n\r\nofficial  languages, Chinese being one of them, there  are  many\r\n\r\nChinese  who will not embrace and accept their own language  and\r\n\r\nheritage.   These  in  particular are the  English-educated  who\r\n\r\nregard English as Singapore's main language, a superior language\r\n\r\nwhich was passed down to us from the colonial days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, when the Chinese-educated community organise\r\n\r\na  talk  or study group and invite eminent scholars to  come  to\r\n\r\nshare their insights on Chinese culture, such an event would  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as a chauvinistic activity when it clearly is  only  a\r\n\r\ncultural  and academic exchange.  The recent cultural  symposium\r\n\r\norganised  by  Lianhe Zaobao was essentially an  experience  for\r\n\r\nsome  Singaporeans to find their lost heritage.  Twelve  hundred\r\n\r\nparticipants were there to seek intellectual stimulation  and  a\r\n\r\ndiversity  of views on life from four eminent personalities.   I\r\n\r\npersonally was appreciative of the effort the Lianhe Zaobao gave\r\n\r\nto  encourage this high level of cultural dialogue.  In my view,\r\n\r\nsuch an event represents a form of cultural renaissance and does\r\n\r\nnot  represent narrow-minded ethnocentric chauvinism.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nChinese culture\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeing  one  of  the world's greatest cultures, has  been  highly\r\n\r\nregarded  by  scholars in America and Europe  do we  then  judge\r\n\r\ntheir  enthusiasm  as misplaced?  What the English-educated  did\r\n\r\nnot realise is the fact that in an increasingly Westernised city-state like Singapore which is dominated by the English language,\r\n\r\nthe Chinese-educated also feel neglected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Chinese as a majority group in this country must\r\n\r\nnot  disregard the sensitive reactions of the other groups.  One\r\n\r\nspecific  example  was  the  recent discussion  by  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nTechnological  University on the creation of a Chinese  Cultural\r\n\r\nInstitute  and  cultural  elite.  A  non-Chinese  felt  strongly\r\n\r\nenough  to  write  to  the press pointing  out  that  this  move\r\n\r\ndirectly  contradicted the early principles of  a  multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-religious  and multi-lingual society.   Other  individuals\r\n\r\nasked:  if  we talk about a Chinese cultural elite,  what  about\r\n\r\nMalay  or  Indian elites?  Or should each of these  cultures  in\r\n\r\ntheir search for cultural excellence, at some level also promote\r\n\r\nthe  larger Singapore culture by encouraging the elites in  each\r\n\r\ngroup  to  build bridges of linkages to help our diverse  groups\r\n\r\nachieve an even higher level of consensus?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally feel that the issue of race cannot be broached\r\n\r\nby  the  intellect or conceptual theories.  I grew up in  Little\r\n\r\nIndia.   During the 50s to the 70s, the neighbours  I  contacted\r\n\r\nwere Malays, Indians and Chinese.  Because my parents had always\r\n\r\nrelated  to different ethnic groups, this exposure had  made  my\r\n\r\nbrothers  and  I  develop a high level of  acceptance  of  other\r\n\r\nraces.   This is the reason why till today, I have close friends\r\n\r\nfrom  different  races.   I  may not  clearly  understand  their\r\n\r\ncultures,  but  this ignorance has not prevented our  friendship\r\n\r\nfrom  developing.  I raise this example to express a  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  barriers  between  races must be removed  by  interpersonal\r\n\r\nrelationships through communication.  Such communication must be\r\n\r\nsustained  over  a  long period, to allow  us  to  develop  from\r\n\r\ndifferent experiences our respect and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfriendship   for   one  another.   The  kind   of   heart-linked\r\n\r\nrelationship  for  one  another is the  best  assurance  against\r\n\r\nracial conflict.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, I make a call for all principals,\r\n\r\nteachers, parents, Government and community agencies to organise\r\n\r\nmore   light   entertaining  events  in  order  to  create   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  for different ethnic groups to meet  and  have  the\r\n\r\nchance  to correct their biases for and misunderstanding of  one\r\n\r\nanother.  We cannot merely \"talk\" about multi-racial society; we\r\n\r\nneed  to  give  time to organise activities  to  \"act  out\"  our\r\n\r\nbeliefs and encourage more noble bridge makers to take the lead.\r\n\r\nThe  Racial Harmony Day is only a symbolic event, what  is  more\r\n\r\nrepresentative of our harmony is the creation and continuity  of\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  relationships at all levels.  At the  present,  we\r\n\r\nare  asked to be open and welcome foreign talents to our country\r\n\r\nto  help  our  economic development. With  their  arrivals,  the\r\n\r\ndiversity  in our multi-cultural society takes on an  additional\r\n\r\ndimension,  making  it  all  the more  necessary  that  we  keep\r\n\r\ndeveloping  the  heart-linked network to achieve overall  social\r\n\r\ncohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can objectively adopt a larger perspective on global\r\n\r\ncultures by recognising that the search for all cultural sources\r\n\r\nis like digging a well: that as we dig deeper, we will find that\r\n\r\nall   different  sources  from  the  well  will  lead   to   one\r\n\r\nundifferentiating source.  If so, why do we not adopt a tolerant\r\n\r\nattitude towards accepting our commonness?  If we start  digging\r\n\r\nour  multi-cultural  wells  based on  this  reckoning,  we  will\r\n\r\nfinally reach the Big Singapore Culture which will be a  mix  of\r\n\r\ntradition  and  modernity, East and West, people's  culture  and\r\n\r\nelite culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I had not intended to speak. I jotted\r\n\r\ndown  some  points,  but  I  thought the  motion  moved  by  the\r\n\r\nNominated Member was so self-evident and worthy of support  that\r\n\r\nit was not necessary for me to speak.  However, I do rise now to\r\n\r\nraise  some  concerns  for the future.  I share  very  much  the\r\n\r\ngratitude, expressed already, that we build from our  good  days\r\n\r\nof  racial  harmony  in the past and I share  a  pride  in  that\r\n\r\nSingapore,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen  it was in Malaysia, stood for Malaysian Malaysia, and then\r\n\r\nstood  for  Singaporean Singapore to act, as  our  pledge  says,\r\n\r\nregardless  of race.  But I am perhaps more cautionary  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  One of the lessons I extracted from history was that we\r\n\r\nshould  not take harmony for granted and that there are possible\r\n\r\nconcerns for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand in good stead because the Constitution promises,\r\n\r\nin Article 12, protection of all citizens against discrimination\r\n\r\nbased  on  race.  But I must share with this House a  perception\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  moved from the idea of a pledge,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nrace,  to a policy of acting with due regard to race.   I  think\r\n\r\nthis  perception  is  wrong.  I think  there  is  no  change  in\r\n\r\nGovernment policy.  But I do share some concerns that there  may\r\n\r\nbe, and I stress the words \"may be\", unintended consequences  of\r\n\r\nsome  existing policies.  I hope I am not misunderstood  here  - policies  which in themselves may be nothing wrong, maybe  good.\r\n\r\nBut there have been concerns raised at various youth seminars  I\r\n\r\nhave attended in this last year that I wish to share.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, and I think this touches very much on NMP Mdm Claire\r\n\r\nChiang's  point,  the  Speak Mandarin campaign.   As  far  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand from the interpretation, she suggested that  English-speaking  Chinese Singaporeans, such as myself,  were  wrong  to\r\n\r\nregard  English as superior.  I think she is right.  English  is\r\n\r\nnot  superior  to Chinese.  But neither is Chinese  superior  to\r\n\r\nEnglish,  nor  to  any other language.  I think  that  there  is\r\n\r\nnothing wrong with each race trying to learn the language  which\r\n\r\nthey associate with their mothers, even if their mothers do  not\r\n\r\nspeak  that  language.   But I am concerned  of  the  unintended\r\n\r\nconsequence of this policy.  I have heard many anecdotal stories\r\n\r\nof  unthinking individuals who, in the name, the misused name of\r\n\r\nthe  Speak Mandarin campaign, switch to Mandarin when there  are\r\n\r\nMalay,   Indian   or  others  like  me,  non-Mandarin   speaking\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  present.  This is an exclusionary  practice.   Must\r\n\r\nall  Chinese  Singaporeans speak Chinese?  Is  English  language\r\n\r\nonly  for work?  What if, as I do, I think, dream and write from\r\n\r\nmy very heart in English?  As I said, I do not claim that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nEnglish  is  superior, but I do not think I am less  Singaporean\r\n\r\nbecause I do not speak Mandarin and Chinese, and I am Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried my best to learn about Chinese history, the\r\n\r\noverseas Chinese from English books.  I hope my child will learn\r\n\r\nMandarin  because that is the school rules now.  But  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink I enjoy a lesser place in the sun, and I do not think that\r\n\r\nis what Mdm Claire Chiang was saying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second unintended consequence which follows from this\r\n\r\nis  the concern of SAP schools.  Mr Shriniwas Rai, the NMP, said\r\n\r\nthat  our  schools tried to build multi-religious, multi-racial,\r\n\r\nmulti-lingual harmony.  I think that is true.  That is  what  we\r\n\r\nare  trying  to  do.   I think it is good to  promote  bilingual\r\n\r\nstudents  among those who can cope with two languages  as  first\r\n\r\nlanguage.   Do not get me wrong.  SAP schools themselves  are  a\r\n\r\nuseful thing.  But there is a concern that the inter-racial  and\r\n\r\ncultural  mix in such schools is reduced, the understanding  and\r\n\r\ninteraction of the bright and young is limited to those who  are\r\n\r\npredominantly  of one culture, one race.  We must remember  that\r\n\r\nschools  are not about purely what we learn from books but  what\r\n\r\nwe learn from each other, from fellow classmates.  The skills of\r\n\r\ncitizenry,  of  getting along, are built in school.   This  must\r\n\r\ninclude in Singapore racial understanding.  So we need to search\r\n\r\nfor a balance in these policies, and to guard against unintended\r\n\r\nconsequences which we may face in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is of ethnic self-help groups. The Government\r\n\r\nhas  said that it thinks this is the best way to mobilise  self-help.   I  think self-help groups are a fact of life which  many\r\n\r\npeople  embrace  at present.  But it should also  be  emphasised\r\n\r\nthat  ethnicity  of  race  should  not  be  the  only  basis  of\r\n\r\nvolunteering  your  service, or volunteerism.   People  may  and\r\n\r\nshould  increasingly volunteer for a common  cause,  not  for  a\r\n\r\ncommon  race.   There  is  a  need to  foster  community  across\r\n\r\nethnicity.   So  when  I  see  initiatives  such  as  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's call for civil society or for  CDCs which  are  based\r\n\r\nmore in geography, or neighbourliness, this is good.  Further\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalong, we need to encourage self-help groups to have more  joint\r\n\r\nprojects and, if I may voice a suggestion, that one day  further\r\n\r\ndown  the  road, we should set a sunset clause for ethnic  self-help   groups,  that  in  the  end  Singaporeans   should   help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, not just those of the same race or ethnicity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connected with this, the debate that is happening in\r\n\r\nIndonesia  must  touch us.  One of the commoner  suggestions  in\r\n\r\nthis  debate is that identity cards or other official  materials\r\n\r\nwhich  describe a race should have this removed.   Our  ICs  are\r\n\r\nsimilar.  I wonder if this continues to be necessary.   I  point\r\n\r\nout  that this is highly artificial given that our rules,  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  them, follow the paternal line only.  So  there  are\r\n\r\nclassification  problems for some people of mixed  marriage  who\r\n\r\nmay  continue to be registered in whatever race their father  is\r\n\r\ndespite how many other races they are married into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The connected concern is with newer Singaporeans and PRs.\r\n\r\nMany  are  racially similar from China, India or other countries\r\n\r\nin  the  region around us.  But we must question if these  newer\r\n\r\nimmigrants  understand the heritage that Mr  Shriniwas  Rai  has\r\n\r\ntalked about in moving this motion.  Do they assimilate to  this\r\n\r\nmulti-racial,   multi-religious,   multi-lingual    belief    in\r\n\r\nSingapore?   Do they understand? It is not just our children,  a\r\n\r\nnewer  generation, these are newer arrivals.  Tensions may arise\r\n\r\nbetween  them  and  us, the older Singaporeans,  and  the  basis\r\n\r\nshould not be on race, on where we come from, but on citizenship\r\n\r\nand where we are going together as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to look forward to the future and now I turn\r\n\r\nto  the present.  I have two concerns.  The first is whether  we\r\n\r\nshould  be thinking about how this economic downturn differently\r\n\r\naffects  different races, and the efforts of help to  all  these\r\n\r\npeople  to  upgrade themselves, whether they are  Chinese  poor,\r\n\r\nMalay  poor, Indian poor or other disadvantaged groups,  through\r\n\r\ntheir self-help and education, these efforts should not be wiped\r\n\r\nout  in the present downturn. They should be monitored and  this\r\n\r\neconomic hardship should be evened out and helped along.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  as  we  learn again from other  countries,  economic\r\n\r\nhardship, if it is uneven, can lead to racial jealousy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other present concern I want to share with the House is\r\n\r\nour  efforts as a country, Singapore, to assist other  countries\r\n\r\nin  the  region.   I  think we would be  right  to  condemn  the\r\n\r\nviolence against the Chinese in Indonesia.  But we, as a  nation\r\n\r\nand  a  people,  would  be wrong to stop the  condemnation  from\r\n\r\nallowing  us  to  help the genuinely poor and  starving  in  the\r\n\r\ncountries around us.  The victims of famine and violence are not\r\n\r\njust Chinese.  There are other races too.  And we should provide\r\n\r\nassistance  without regard to race, people to  people,  as  good\r\n\r\nneighbours,  as  human beings, because human  rights  are  being\r\n\r\nviolated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, many of these policies which Government has\r\n\r\nput  in  place,  I  understand, and I  think  many  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nsupport.   I  have  tried  to  share  some  of  the  dangers  of\r\n\r\nunintended  consequences.  We have a good base  and  I  join  Mr\r\n\r\nShriniwas  Rai in supporting this motion.  It is  a  good  base,\r\n\r\nhowever, and all history is, to build towards a future,  not  to\r\n\r\nsit back and take for granted.  The greatest tribute to the past\r\n\r\nis  that  we move on from racial tolerance to racial harmony  to\r\n\r\nracial  understanding, and perhaps, at least in my  view,  to  a\r\n\r\nfuture of a non-racial Singapore, a society in which race is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  a  factor to be considered in life, either for merit  or\r\n\r\ndemerit,  but  a  society in which we are truly individuals  and\r\n\r\ntruly judged on our merits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen\r\n\r\nSeow Phun): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mr Rai and Mdm Claire Chiang\r\n\r\nwere   touched   by  the  National  Education  Exhibition.   The\r\n\r\nhistorical  events  and lessons depicted by the  Exhibition  had\r\n\r\nmoved him to move the motion.  I think this is a commendable act\r\n\r\nand I agree with him that Singaporeans ought to feel a sense  of\r\n\r\ngratitude for the contributions made by our founding fathers and\r\n\r\nindeed  our forefathers.  This is the kind of values we want  to\r\n\r\npromote in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai is right in saying that every dollar spent is well\r\n\r\nspent on the Exhibition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nEveryone that I talked to, who has watched it, tells me that  it\r\n\r\nwas  good.   But  their experiences vary.   Some  of  the  older\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  were  so  touched that their  tears  flowed.   The\r\n\r\nyounger  ones were less so.  Mdm Claire Chiang tried to  explain\r\n\r\nwhy. Although the younger ones equally enjoyed the show and felt\r\n\r\nthat  the production was good and entertaining, we cannot expect\r\n\r\nthem to have the same degree of emotions as the older ones.  The\r\n\r\nlessons, however, are no less relevant today.  Mdm Claire Chiang\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Tay  spoke about the concerns they have.  Let  me  just\r\n\r\nrespond  to some of these concerns, and after that I would  like\r\n\r\nto go on to something which I think is even more important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Tay that we should not take harmony for\r\n\r\ngranted.   He expressed concerns about some policies,  like  the\r\n\r\nSpeak  Mandarin campaign, self-help groups, SAP schools, and  so\r\n\r\non.   I  am  glad  to  hear that he realises that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nintention  to  look at the policies from the racial  angle.   He\r\n\r\nknows  that  the intention for these polices is really  to  help\r\n\r\nbuild  a  stronger  nation.   If he  takes  the  Speak  Mandarin\r\n\r\ncampaign  as  an example, he would agree that mother  tongue  is\r\n\r\nvery  important  and  if  we  lose  this  part  of  our  culture\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will be less rooted.  He talked about SAP  schools.\r\n\r\nAgain,  here it is important that we want to promote the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue,  and  he  thinks that because of  that,  racial  mix  is\r\n\r\nreduced.   But let me remind him that if you go to  our  housing\r\n\r\nestates,  if  you participate in our grassroots activities,  you\r\n\r\nwould  notice that the racial mix is there.  So our children  in\r\n\r\nfact  have got many opportunities to mix, interact, and  get  to\r\n\r\nknow  one another, even to appreciate one another's culture.   I\r\n\r\nthink  the  elected MPs would know, if you look at the  cultural\r\n\r\nfunctions  and activities that we organise, they are all  multi-cultural, and the different races actually participate and learn\r\n\r\nfrom  each  other's culture.  Even in schools,  I  believe  that\r\n\r\nmulti-racialism  is  taught  very early  and  the  schools  also\r\n\r\nprovide the environment to promote interaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the self-help groups, I think he would agree that at\r\n\r\nthis point in time it is perhaps the best and most effective way\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans to help each other.  Even in self-help groups,\r\n\r\nfrom  my experience, a particular self-help group is not  closed\r\n\r\nto  other  races to take part or participate in its  programmes.\r\n\r\nBut  in order for us to draw the maximum support and involvement\r\n\r\nfrom  Singaporeans, self-help groups are there to  provide  this\r\n\r\nmost  effective approach.  Therefore, I would say -  although  I\r\n\r\nunderstand his concern about unintended consequences -  that  he\r\n\r\nbe  rest  assured  that  the  Government,  the  people  and  the\r\n\r\norganisations concerned know what they are doing and there is no\r\n\r\nquestion about the importance of multi-racialism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His concern about crisis affecting different races and\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  uneven and so on, I think here again  it  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion for the Government and the nation as a whole to  tackle\r\n\r\nand  I do not see any imminent problem in this area.  I am  also\r\n\r\nglad   to  hear  that  he  talked  about  the  need  to   extend\r\n\r\nhumanitarian  aid to neighbouring countries regardless  of  what\r\n\r\nhappened.   If you have followed the news, that is what  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing.   I have no problem with what he has talked about,  like,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  the need for immigrants to assimilate  into  our\r\n\r\nsociety and our culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, to me, to debate Mr Rai's motion, it would be\r\n\r\npertinent  to ask ourselves how our forefathers would  react  to\r\n\r\nour  expression of gratitude.  Put yourself in the shoes of  our\r\n\r\nforefathers, and if they hear about this debate, how would  they\r\n\r\nfeel?   If  you  allow me, Sir, I would submit that  they  would\r\n\r\nprobably have the following response:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"My son, we are happy that you feel grateful for what we\r\n\r\nhave  done  for you.  But we will be even happier if  you  truly\r\n\r\nunderstand  how we have got here today and carry  on  doing  the\r\n\r\nright things to protect, preserve and build upon what we,  as  a\r\n\r\nnation,  have  achieved thus far.  We had come to  Singapore  in\r\n\r\nsearch  of  a  better life.  Our success did not come  about  by\r\n\r\nchance. We had worked very hard and through our sweat and blood,\r\n\r\nwe had earned a good living for ourselves\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  for  our families.  There were oppositions along  the  way.\r\n\r\nThere were people, and perhaps they are still around today,  who\r\n\r\nwanted to lord it over us.  But we took our destiny into our own\r\n\r\nhands.   It was not easy because we are small.  How did we  make\r\n\r\nit?   We made it by promoting harmony and unity among ourselves,\r\n\r\nby sheer discipline and hard work, and by implementing the right\r\n\r\nsocial  and  economic policies.  But most important of  all,  we\r\n\r\nmade  it  because we stood up as a sovereign nation, pursuing  a\r\n\r\nconsistent  foreign policy of mutual respect, mutual cooperation\r\n\r\nand  mutual benefit.  As a small state, if we cannot  speak  and\r\n\r\nact  as equals among bigger nations, then we will be forever  at\r\n\r\nthe  mercy  of  others.   Therefore, never,  never  forget  this\r\n\r\ncrucial  truth.   The day you forget this will be  the  day  you\r\n\r\nbegin  your downward journey as a nation.  Do not let  Singapore\r\n\r\ngo  down,  even if we have to lose our lives, or we  will  never\r\n\r\ncome up again.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our founding fathers had painstakingly built up\r\n\r\nSingapore, our homeland, to what it is today.  It behoves us  to\r\n\r\ndefend, protect and build upon it.  I am taking advantage of  Mr\r\n\r\nRai's  motion  to  remind Singaporeans what our response  should\r\n\r\nrightly  be, following this expression of gratitude towards  our\r\n\r\nfounding fathers.  I think Singaporeans would agree with me that\r\n\r\nthis  is the best way to say, `thank you'.  I think there is  no\r\n\r\ndisagreement  here  that  this should  be  our  right  response,\r\n\r\nalthough concerns have been expressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just say a few words in Mandarin in response to Mdm\r\n\r\nChiang's speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin) Nominated MP Claire Chiang felt that the\r\n\r\nlack  of   national consciousness among our younger  people  was\r\n\r\nprobably due to language problem. Perhaps, in the past,  we  had\r\n\r\nnot done enough to inculcate in our younger generation knowledge\r\n\r\npertaining  to  national consciousness.  But I  think  the  main\r\n\r\nreason  is that the younger generation of Singaporeans have  not\r\n\r\ngone through the type of hardship and sufferings experienced  by\r\n\r\nour  founding fathers during the war, the difficult lives in the\r\n\r\npost-war era, and the struggles in our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearly  days of nation-building.  Since they have not experienced\r\n\r\nsuch  difficult situations, they naturally would have  different\r\n\r\nviews,  different mindsets and different feelings.  So we should\r\n\r\ngo one step further in strengthening the inculcation of national\r\n\r\nconsciousness in our young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I agree with her that in the promotion of racial\r\n\r\nharmony,  the  important thing is to have more  interaction  and\r\n\r\ncommunications  among  the  different   ethnic  groups  in   our\r\n\r\nsociety.   This  is  correct.  It is for this  reason  that  our\r\n\r\npolicies,    whether   in  public  housing   or   in   community\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  are such that we constantly encourage inter-ethnic\r\n\r\nlinkage whereby people of all races would live  together in  the\r\n\r\nsame  housing  estate and in one big community.  Our  activities\r\n\r\nare  always  aimed  at  encouraging people of  different  ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups  to have further understanding and interaction  with  one\r\n\r\nanother.  Of course, I also agree with her  that we should  have\r\n\r\nmutual  tolerance  and accommodation for one another.   This  is\r\n\r\nvery important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the motion before the House today, I feel that apart\r\n\r\nfrom   urging   the   younger  generation   to   recognise   the\r\n\r\ncontributions  made  by our founding fathers  and  reaffirm  and\r\n\r\nrecord  our appreciation for such contributions, we should  also\r\n\r\nthink  of how our founding fathers might react to our expression\r\n\r\nof  gratitude.  They may say, \"Well, we are very  happy  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  you are showing gratitude but, more importantly, you  must\r\n\r\nrealize how hard we had fought to bring Singapore to what it  is\r\n\r\ntoday.   As  a small nation, Singapore is very vulnerable.   You\r\n\r\nmust  work hard to see that we continue to have a place  in  the\r\n\r\nglobal environment.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we remember how our founding fathers had struggled and\r\n\r\nendured to bring us to the enviable situation we have today,  we\r\n\r\nmust not let them down. We must  continue to persevere and carry\r\n\r\non  building on the strong foundation that they have  built  for\r\n\r\nus.   I  think this may well be the best form of expressing  our\r\n\r\nappreciation for what they have done for us, and indeed the best\r\n\r\nway of saying `thank you' to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I just want to make some\r\n\r\nremarks on Mr Simon Tay's comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Vice-Chairman of CDAC, I would like to explain that\r\n\r\na  self-help group like CDAC is not based on racial segregation.\r\n\r\nAlthough our purpose is to serve the Chinese community, students\r\n\r\nfrom  other  racial  groups are allowed to  join  some  selected\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   For instance, our Students' Service Centre  allows\r\n\r\nstudents of other races to participate in our training sessions.\r\n\r\nMany  people  probably have the wrong impression that  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups, based on ethnic communities, could divide our people.  I\r\n\r\nthink  we  had discussed this when we set up CDAC  at  the  very\r\n\r\nbeginning.  But from experience we found that the most effective\r\n\r\nway  for  a racial group to help themselves is to let themselves\r\n\r\nproduce and create the momentum so that they realise where their\r\n\r\nweaknesses   are,  and  work  out  the  programmes  to   upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves.  If each self-help group has done its best,  putting\r\n\r\nthem  together, it would be able to raise the level of  progress\r\n\r\nof  all  groups  in the whole nation, which need  the  necessary\r\n\r\nhelp, to a higher level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at history. When our forefathers came, I think\r\n\r\nthey  came  as a group.  We have Chinese clans; we  have  Indian\r\n\r\nclans.   We have other groups. They probably operated and worked\r\n\r\nwithin  their own group. They have contributed to the growth  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  today.   And  if you look at  what  we  have  in  the\r\n\r\ncommerce  sector, we have the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce,  the\r\n\r\nIndian  Chamber of Commerce, the Malay Chamber of  Commerce.   I\r\n\r\nwas involved in the Chinese Chamber of Commerce for more than 10\r\n\r\nyears.  I can tell you that if we mix all the traders under  one\r\n\r\nroof, it is very difficult to work because sometimes the problem\r\n\r\nmay  not  be a common problem.  So it is not the most  effective\r\n\r\nway to find a solution and to discuss common problems.  But with\r\n\r\nthese  three  basic  groups and on  top  of  it,  there  is  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Chambers of Commerce for Singapore, which  groups\r\n\r\nthe three basic groups together, I think that is a good\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narrangement.   The  fact that we have three separate  commercial\r\n\r\ngroups is not a policy of racial segregation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that a beautiful painting is made up of\r\n\r\ndifferent colours.  Different races in Singapore, be it Chinese,\r\n\r\nIndian, Malay or Eurasians, are different colours.  We paint the\r\n\r\ndifferent  colours  on a piece of paper and as  a  painting,  it\r\n\r\nlooks  beautiful.  If you mix all the colours into one and paint\r\n\r\nit  on  a piece of paper, it is one colour.  It will be  a  dull\r\n\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I expected, when\r\n\r\nI  saw this motion, it has turned out to be a song of praise  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  have been in charge of the affairs of  this  country\r\n\r\nsince  1959.  The mover of the motion says he was so  moved,  he\r\n\r\ngot  emotional,  and  so he decided he must  give  vent  to  his\r\n\r\nemotion and move this motion in Parliament.  I am glad that  the\r\n\r\ntwo  other  speakers who followed him have brought him  down  to\r\n\r\nearth a little bit.  He was floating on cloud nine, as they say,\r\n\r\nmoved by his emotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not quite follow who he is referring to as\r\n\r\nfounding  fathers.  He mentioned a host of names.  Are they  the\r\n\r\nfounding  fathers of Singapore?  Is that what he says?   Or  are\r\n\r\nthe  founding fathers the people who turned Singapore from  what\r\n\r\nit was a swamp in 1819 when it was first spotted into what it is\r\n\r\ntoday?   So let us be clear as to who we are talking about  when\r\n\r\nwe talk about our founding fathers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would have thought, listening to the mover, that before\r\n\r\n1959,  there  was  no  racial harmony, there  was  no  religious\r\n\r\nharmony, the different races were at one another's throats.  Let\r\n\r\nme  assure   those who were perhaps not here, in Singapore  that\r\n\r\nis,  not even on the planet, in those days there was nothing  of\r\n\r\nthat  sort.   No  doubt the British had their  divide  and  rule\r\n\r\npolicy,  but  in  spite of that, the races did  get  along  well\r\n\r\ntogether, and I think Mdm Claire Chiang said that herself  about\r\n\r\ngrowing up in Little India.  So it is not as though it was  only\r\n\r\nafter  1959 that we have had racial harmony, religious  harmony,\r\n\r\nmulti-lingualism  and  multi-culturalism.   I  question  whether\r\n\r\nthose values, those terms, still apply to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been expressed and this is something that I fear\r\n\r\nmyself, there is a growing tendency towards compartmentalisation\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  I know the Assistant Director of the CDAC  tried\r\n\r\nto  explain  that the CDAC is not just purely Chinese.   But  we\r\n\r\nhave  the MENDAKI, we have got SINDA, we have got CDAC  and  now\r\n\r\nthe  Eurasian community thinks it has got to have  its  own  and\r\n\r\nthey  set up their own.  So the impression is that the different\r\n\r\ncommunities have to look after their own affairs, promote  their\r\n\r\nown  growth  in  this place and should not  look  to  the  other\r\n\r\ncommunities, that they themselves are responsible for what  they\r\n\r\nare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not going to help, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\ncreating a Singapore identity.  We talk about culture.  Yes,  we\r\n\r\nhave got the Chinese culture, we have got the Indian culture, we\r\n\r\nhave  got the Malay culture.  But what is the Singapore culture?\r\n\r\nIs  there such a thing as the Singapore culture here?  Or is  it\r\n\r\njust  making of money, that is Singapore culture?  Have we tried\r\n\r\nto  find a synthesis, as someone said in a letter to the papers,\r\n\r\nof the various cultures into a unique Singapore culture?  Is any\r\n\r\nattempt  being made or are the people who try to write something\r\n\r\ncreatively slapped down because the authorities think  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncriticism?   And  how do we maintain religious harmony  in  this\r\n\r\nplace?  By telling the clerics that they are not to speak on any\r\n\r\nissue  concerning society, otherwise they would be  thrown  into\r\n\r\nprison.  Is that religious harmony?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine all these platitudes that have been thrown\r\n\r\nabout.  Is any attempt being made to examine the society  as  it\r\n\r\nis today  you will hear some of it when I move my motion  to see\r\n\r\nwhat  kind  of a society we have become?  And there is  a  great\r\n\r\nresponsibility  on  us now for our children and  our  children's\r\n\r\nchildren.  What are we going to pass to them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is time that we consciously\r\n\r\ntried  to  avoid talking about the different races in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand made an effort to talk about just Singaporeans.  I have many\r\n\r\na time said that I cannot see the need for showing the different\r\n\r\nraces, the classification in our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nidentity  cards.  When I am asked to fill up a form,  and  there\r\n\r\nare  so many of these forms everywhere, you invariably find  the\r\n\r\nbox  \"race\" and I enter the term \"Human\" because we must realise\r\n\r\nthat  whether  we are Indians, Chinese, Malays  or  whatnot,  we\r\n\r\nbelong  in the end to one human race, and that is what  we  are.\r\n\r\nAnd  so  I hope that we will try to create a oneness of all  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  gather  in  one single purpose  and  not  keep  them\r\n\r\ncompartmentalised and say to them \"you are responsible for  your\r\n\r\nown  development\" and each community will take care of  its  own\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I proposed at the last sitting of Parliament that we set up\r\n\r\na  Board  of Equal Rights and that was laughed at and dismissed,\r\n\r\n\"We  don't need it in Singapore.\"  We do, because if we  believe\r\n\r\nthat  everyone  is entitled to his right without regard  to  his\r\n\r\nrace,  religion or what else, then we should have a proper  body\r\n\r\nwho  will  examine any complaint that he is being discriminated.\r\n\r\nThat  might  help  in creating the impression  and  sending  the\r\n\r\nmessage to our people that we are truly interested in creating a\r\n\r\none  people  united together, a one people, not  four  different\r\n\r\npeoples,  united  together in one common purpose,  not  our  own\r\n\r\nseparate purposes or our separate courses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read, some four or five years ago, that the present\r\n\r\nSenior Minister who was then the Prime Minister speaking in  one\r\n\r\nof  the cities in Central Asia, said he was presiding over  four\r\n\r\nfish tanks and there were different fishes swimming in different\r\n\r\ntanks,  and  he  has got to see that they were kept  separately.\r\n\r\nLet  us  try  and  get all the fish into one tank  and  live  in\r\n\r\nSingapore as a single one people with one purpose, one  aim  and\r\n\r\nmake an attempt to evolve a Singapore culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just\r\n\r\nlike to join in this debate hoping that I could clarify some  of\r\n\r\nthe  confusion that happened during the discussion.  As  to  who\r\n\r\nour  founding  fathers are, I think we should  be  referring  to\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  planted  the seeds of multi-racialism,  multi-culturalism and racial harmony.  The Malays were here.  They had\r\n\r\nthe island to themselves.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChinese  came here to escape famine.  The Indians came  here  to\r\n\r\nwork.   The  British segregated us and so did the Japanese.   It\r\n\r\nwas  our first generation leaders who took the decision  to  put\r\n\r\nall  these  together  and established as  a  principle  of  this\r\n\r\nnation,  multi-culturalism, multi-racialism and racial  harmony.\r\n\r\nThese  are  the people we should thank for and be  grateful  for\r\n\r\nwhat we have today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to\r\n\r\nseveral  Members who have spoken.  I am a bit surprised with  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam's  stand.   I thought that this  was  a  very  civil,\r\n\r\ncourteous act.  We will not get involved in party politics,  but\r\n\r\nhe must get involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I want to take him to pre-1959 and I will take the\r\n\r\nhistorical process.  I have read the Hansard before  coming.   I\r\n\r\nhave done my homework.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> How much of the Hansard have you read?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> It does not matter, Mr Jeyaretnam. Let\r\n\r\nus talk history.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, when Mr David Marshall formed an elected\r\n\r\ngovernment,  he  felt  that the Chinese and  Malay  schools  had\r\n\r\nsuffered  deprivation.  English was the supreme  language,   and\r\n\r\nthis disadvantaged more than three-quarters of our people.   The\r\n\r\nfrustration  of  the  Chinese students,  the  Tamil  and  Malay-speaking  students  could not be expressed by  those  who  spoke\r\n\r\nEnglish, and there was an All-Party Committee of Inquiry.  Prior\r\n\r\nto 1959, you had no right of audience in this House if you spoke\r\n\r\na  language  other  than English.  The rules of  the  game  were\r\n\r\nchanged, and that is what I call multi-lingualism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak with some fervour, Sir, because I took some risks.\r\n\r\nIn  1986,  my  Hindi  community wanted Hindi to  be  recognised.\r\n\r\nPrior  to that, the then Prime Minister said, \"No.  If  you  are\r\n\r\nan  Indian, you study Tamil.\"  We formed a protem committee.  We\r\n\r\nconvinced the Government that our Indian students from non-Tamil\r\n\r\nbackground were losing culturally.  So Government allowed  Hindi\r\n\r\nand other Indian languages.  And nowhere\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  world such a minority community was given  equal  right\r\n\r\nwith  Mandarin  and  Malay.   Is that  not  equality  in  multi-lingualism?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was surprised, again another aspersion by Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\non  self-help groups.  As Dr Ker has mentioned, if Mr Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nwas  aware, he would not have made this allegation.   I  confess\r\n\r\nthat  I am not in favour of a communal set up, but there  is  no\r\n\r\nother  alternative at the moment.  I am the Secretary  of  SINDA\r\n\r\nand I declare my interest.  As Dr Ker has pointed out, SINDA and\r\n\r\nCDAC are working together and eventually I hope, not 10-15 years\r\n\r\nbut maybe 50 years from now, we can disband these bodies and  we\r\n\r\ncan all have a national organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may laugh, but these are the realities of Singapore\r\n\r\npolitics.   I  give you an example.  We have Malay and  Eurasian\r\n\r\nstudents  in SINDA.  We have non-Indian teachers teaching  these\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I have told the Prime Minister several times\r\n\r\nthat  all  the four umbrella organisations should work together.\r\n\r\nWe are moving in this direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on SAP schools, I share some of the sentiments\r\n\r\nexpressed  by my colleague, Mr Simon Tay.  There is this  danger\r\n\r\nwhich  we  will have to address.  SAP school students will  grow\r\n\r\nup,  their best part of their life, isolated without having  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of mixing with the other communities.  Of course,  they\r\n\r\nplay on the playing field and in surrounding areas.  But in  the\r\n\r\nschool,  they  are left by themselves.  My good friend,  Zainul,\r\n\r\nwas  together with me in the University.  We used  to  speak  in\r\n\r\nbazaar Malay.  We could exchange views even though we came  from\r\n\r\ndifferent  backgrounds because we came from schools  which  have\r\n\r\nmulti-racial students.  My fear is that the SAP school  students\r\n\r\nwill  be  isolated.  We must try to take some steps  to  correct\r\n\r\nthis imbalance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several Members have spoken. What is Singapore\r\n\r\nculture?   Singapore culture is not massing together  into  one,\r\n\r\nbut each culture blossoms, taking into cognizance that there are\r\n\r\ndifferent values,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifferent  cultures, different languages and different religious\r\n\r\nbackgrounds.  We cannot force one culture on the other,  but  we\r\n\r\ncan  co-exist.  And we hope in years to come, we  can  create  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  culture.  Nowhere in the world is there a mixture  of\r\n\r\nso  many races and languages and coming out with one.  Even  the\r\n\r\nAmericans  have  tried it.  They are still  trying  it.   It  is\r\n\r\nyears,  decades,  centuries.  So  we  have  to  live  with  this\r\n\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we are a different community. We must not\r\n\r\njust  tolerate,  as  I  said earlier,  we  must  appreciate  and\r\n\r\nunderstand and take positive steps to inculcate in our youth the\r\n\r\nvalue  of respect and understanding.   And that is why  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Government did a wise thing because nowhere do we have  one\r\n\r\ncommunity living in segregation.  I think it was a very wise and\r\n\r\nbold  decision.  I think it was Mr Dhanabalan who  initiated  it\r\n\r\nand we should live by it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it has been a long day. I have\r\n\r\nmany things to say but I do not want to hold up the Members.   I\r\n\r\nwould  ask this House that this is an act of civility.   Let  us\r\n\r\nvote  unanimously on this resolution and show our  appreciation.\r\n\r\nAnd as Dr Chen has pointed out, the best tribute we could pay to\r\n\r\nthem  is to live and improve upon them.  The British never  came\r\n\r\nhere  to give us multi-racialism.  They came and they were  very\r\n\r\nhonest.   They  came here as a trading company, the  East  India\r\n\r\nCompany.  It was only in 1955 we started moving.  That was why I\r\n\r\nmade  it very clear.  I have clarified who were our forefathers.\r\n\r\nAs  regards our founding fathers, I refer to post-1955.   If  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  remembers, I mentioned Mr David Marshall because  he\r\n\r\nwas a true son of Singapore.  I am proud of him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the House to support the motion?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House records with gratitude the contribution\r\n\r\nmade  by our founding fathers in building a multi-racial, multi-religious   and   multi-lingual  society  and  reaffirms   these\r\n\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REMOVAL OF FEAR IN PEOPLE'S LIVES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br>6.38 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> This motion is subject to signification\r\n\r\nof  support  by at least one Member.

And I have no doubt\r\n\r\nthat  the  faithful  press  under the  baton  of  an  ex-Cabinet\r\n\r\nMinister  will  tell  its captive readers in Singapore  tomorrow\r\n\r\nthat  whilst the country was worried about its economic  worries\r\n\r\nand  anxious  about its future, there is this  man,  Jeyaretnam,\r\n\r\nstill  bringing up old bogeys.  I am used to all this, but  that\r\n\r\ndoes  not deter me from moving what I think is right and calling\r\n\r\nthis House to face the realities of Singapore today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is no question that fear\r\n\r\ngrips  our people's lives in Singapore and I will, in the course\r\n\r\nof  my speech, show you where and how it is found.  And there is\r\n\r\nno question that fear is a paralysis.  It numbs you.  Fear numbs\r\n\r\na  person into inaction.  If you are suddenly struck with  fear,\r\n\r\nyou  cannot  even think.  So fear is a paralysis that  paralyses\r\n\r\nyour thinking capacities.  It paralyses your capability to do or\r\n\r\nact  and that, I am sure, Members will agree is no basis  for  a\r\n\r\nsociety,  especially for a society to go into the 21st  century.\r\n\r\nAs  I  said,  whilst   this  motion  may  be  thought  as  being\r\n\r\nirrelevant in view of today's present worries in Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nmain  reason  why  I  am moving this motion is  because  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic crisis.  Let that be understood.  It has been said more\r\n\r\nthan once\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  the  troubles in this region stem, if not  wholly,  partly\r\n\r\nfrom the lack of transparency and accountability on the part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government in the decision making process, and  in  denying\r\n\r\npeople  of their rights to take part in decision making  and  to\r\n\r\nquestion decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of economic measures have been proposed. They are\r\n\r\nnot  all that wonderful but, be that as it may, nothing has been\r\n\r\nsaid  about what the Government proposes to do about this  other\r\n\r\ncause of our recession, lack of transparency and accountability.\r\n\r\nAnd  so  I  am  proposing this motion that we take  measures  to\r\n\r\ncorrect  that, not just economic measures, and this  is  a  more\r\n\r\nimportant measure that we have to take, if we want to  see  that\r\n\r\nthis country progresses economically in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the fear? What are the people afraid of? First of\r\n\r\nall, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a fear of being locked up.\r\n\r\nI  will tell you why and how it operates, but may I just,  first\r\n\r\nof  all, outline what is the fear in the people's lives.  I hear\r\n\r\nthis everywhere; the fear of the knock on their door at 2.00 am,\r\n\r\nthe  fear of being driven blind-folded and thrown into a  prison\r\n\r\ncell  without any recourse to the courts.  That is a real  fear,\r\n\r\nand we just cannot ignore it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the other fear? The fear for their rice bowl, the\r\n\r\nfear that should they in some way or other incur the displeasure\r\n\r\nof  the Government or the powers that be, their rice bowl may be\r\n\r\nbroken  or cracked.  Employees are worried that their employment\r\n\r\nmay  be  terminated if they should show themselves to be partial\r\n\r\ntowards  any  opposition party, or working  with  an  opposition\r\n\r\nparty.   Businesses are worried or anxious that they should  not\r\n\r\nbe seen as helping in any way any opposition party, otherwise in\r\n\r\nsome  way  or other, their business will be affected, and  there\r\n\r\nare  many  ways in which the Government can make its displeasure\r\n\r\nknown, and I will outline to you how it is done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, over the years, from\r\n\r\n1959,  we have built up a system of patronage where anything  is\r\n\r\ndependent on whether one conforms to what our rulers tell us  is\r\n\r\ngood for us.  It is a society which is always looking to see\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhat  its patron thinks about its actions and, in Singapore,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the patron is the PAP or, should I say, the  Godfather.\r\n\r\nYou incur their displeasure and you suffer.  You do that at your\r\n\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this fear seen? Where is it manifested? You see\r\n\r\nit, first of all, if I may refer to my colleagues at the Bar, in\r\n\r\nthe  lawyers'  reluctance to act for opposition candidates,  and\r\n\r\neven  in non-commercial suits against the  Government.  This  is\r\n\r\nnot something fanciful.  This is real.  The courts were told  of\r\n\r\nthe difficulties that Mr Tang Liang Hong had in getting a lawyer\r\n\r\nto represent him.  He swore an affidavit in court saying that he\r\n\r\nhad  approached  no less than eight lawyers and  who,  for  some\r\n\r\nreason or other, declined his brief, and so he had to bring in a\r\n\r\ncounsel from England to represent him.  There was his wife,  Mdm\r\n\r\nTeo  Siew Har.  I myself, Sir, approached two senior lawyers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to ask whether they would take up her matter and  they\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Mr Jeyaretnam, please, you know, we would have, in other\r\n\r\ncases, but I do not think we can in this case.  Our partners may\r\n\r\nnot  like it.  So, if you do not mind, we won't.\"  So she  could\r\n\r\nnot  get  a  lawyer.   Even if you go to a lawyer  with  a  suit\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Government, which has nothing to do with  commerce\r\n\r\nor  for  damages arising from a traffic accident,  but  a  claim\r\n\r\nbecause  of  some injustice done, lawyers invariably  refuse  to\r\n\r\naccept  the  brief.  I have to tell you again,  through  my  own\r\n\r\nexperience, people come to me and say, \"Mr Jeyaretnam,  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen to other lawyers.  They do not want to take up the case.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have the reluctance of printers to print for\r\n\r\nopposition  parties. We experienced this in the  last  election.\r\n\r\nIt  is not that they are worried about being thrown into prison,\r\n\r\nneither  are  the  lawyers.  They are  all  worried  that  their\r\n\r\nbusinesses will suffer.  As in the case of lawyers and printers,\r\n\r\nthey  depend perhaps on getting work from the statutory  boards,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and  from  other  financial  institutions,  big\r\n\r\ncompanies.  So  they are worried that their  businesses  may  be\r\n\r\naffected.  Printers refuse to print posters\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor, even if they are prepared to agree, they would ask, \"Can  we\r\n\r\nleave our name out of the posters?  We would rather not have our\r\n\r\nname  on  the  posters?\"  Why?  \"Because we have got  Government\r\n\r\ncontracts.   We cannot lose our business.\"  Then  there  is  the\r\n\r\nfear  or  the reluctance of owners of premises, be it  shops  or\r\n\r\nhouses,  to allow opposition parties any use of their  premises.\r\n\r\nAgain, I will give you an experience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last election, I decided that I would go into Ang\r\n\r\nMo  Kio  to meet the residents there every week.  When  I  first\r\n\r\nwent there, there was a shopkeeper who was quite willing to  let\r\n\r\nme  have a little space there to sit down, only once a week  for\r\n\r\nabout  two  hours or so, and to see anyone who came to  see  me.\r\n\r\nBut  within two weeks he said, \"Mr Jeyaretnam, I am  sorry.\"   I\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Why?\"  He said, \"HDB has sent me a letter saying how dare\r\n\r\nI  let out my shop premises.  I cannot let it out.\"  He had  not\r\n\r\nlet  it  out to me.  I was only occupying a space.  But what  is\r\n\r\nthe  good of me trying to argue with him that he had not let  it\r\n\r\nout.   He  said,  \"Please, Mr Jeyaretnam, try and  find  another\r\n\r\nplace.\"  That's it.  That is real in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have the reluctance of Singaporeans to offer\r\n\r\nthemselves  as  candidates  for  opposition  parties.   I   have\r\n\r\nmentioned  this time and time again.  In the last  election,  we\r\n\r\nhad  three candidates who were very good quality.  I do not want\r\n\r\nto  mention their names but who, in the last minute, came to  me\r\n\r\nand  said,  \"My  wife  is very worried  and  very  anxious.   My\r\n\r\nchildren are worried.  My brothers are worried.  I cannot.  They\r\n\r\nsay  I  am  mad  or something, offering myself as an  opposition\r\n\r\ncandidate.\"  That is what they told me.  So I said, \"All  right,\r\n\r\nif  that is what it is, stay out.\"  So are we going to build  up\r\n\r\nan  opposition in Singapore when our citizens live in fear?   An\r\n\r\nopposition,  of  course, is the sine qua  non  of  a  democratic\r\n\r\nsociety where different views may be expressed and heard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the reluctance among our people to express\r\n\r\nany  opinion in public.  This is because of the threat of  being\r\n\r\npicked up at 2.00 am and thrown into\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprison.  They  look around even when they talk  to  you  to  see\r\n\r\nwhether any officer from the ISD is around.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the fear of voting for the opposition, even\r\n\r\nto  cast  their  vote.  This fear stems from the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nserial  number  on the Register of Electors is  entered  on  the\r\n\r\ncounterfoil.  The 1966 Constitutional Commission drew  attention\r\n\r\nto  this and said that it was a violation of the secrecy of  the\r\n\r\nballot  and  they  said  that should be removed.   But  did  the\r\n\r\nGovernment remove it?  No.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the fear among civil servants to talk to or\r\n\r\nsee  opposition parties, and particularly their leaders.  Again,\r\n\r\nmay  I  quote from experience?  In 1982, when I was the  MP  for\r\n\r\nAnson, we had a problem about getting office space for me to see\r\n\r\nthe  residents.  So we wrote to HDB and in the end I was getting\r\n\r\na bit tired of the correspondence and I said, \"I wish to see the\r\n\r\nChairman.\"  There was no direct answer to this.  Then I happened\r\n\r\nto  meet  the  Chairman at a private party.   I  had  known  the\r\n\r\nChairman  even  before I became an MP.  We were friends.   So  I\r\n\r\nasked him, \"Have you seen this correspondence?\" I think he  said\r\n\r\nhe was not very much aware of what was going on.  I said, \"May I\r\n\r\ncome  and  see  you?\"  I could see suddenly that  he  was  taken\r\n\r\naback.   He  said, \"Well, I have to find out whether I  can  see\r\n\r\nyou.\"  Then I never heard from him after that.  And this is  the\r\n\r\nChairman of the Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this fear kept in place and maintained? Mainly by\r\n\r\nthe  threat  of  prison.   Because there is this  power  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  pick people up and cast them into  prison,   and\r\n\r\nwithout any recourse to the courts.  May I say in 1988 or  1989,\r\n\r\nsuddenly  the  courts  decided, following the  trends  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  that they had the power to inquire into the  merits,\r\n\r\nand  this was the judgement of the Court of Appeal.  Fast on the\r\n\r\nheels of that judgement came the amendment to the legislation  - the  courts shall not inquire into the merits; it is  not  their\r\n\r\nbusiness.  And yet the courts in other countries do inquire into\r\n\r\nthe  merits of any detention, any imprisonment.  So the position\r\n\r\nin Singapore today is that somebody who is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndetained  under  the Internal Security Act, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  has  no  legal redress.  He is dependent entirely  on  the\r\n\r\nmercy of the Government.  He may be released if he confesses  to\r\n\r\nhaving  been a bad fellow.  But if he does not want to  confess,\r\n\r\nhe stays.  And we have a classic example in Mr Chia Thye Poh who\r\n\r\nspent  23 years in prison, a man who belonged to the same party,\r\n\r\nwho shared the same ideals as the founding fathers.  But because\r\n\r\nafter  some  years  he decided that he could  not  accept  their\r\n\r\nideals and wanted to move away, he was picked up and imprisoned.\r\n\r\nThis power is used not for the purpose that it was intended  for\r\n\r\nbut  for purely other purposes - just to ensure that the PAP  is\r\n\r\nkept in power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most glaring example is the detention in 1987. Time\r\n\r\ndoes  not  permit me, Mr Deputy Speaker, to go through  all  the\r\n\r\npersons who were detained and the reasons given.  But there  was\r\n\r\nthe  case of one Miss Teo Soh Lung.  And what was the reason for\r\n\r\nher  detention?   The  reason was that she had  facilitated  the\r\n\r\ninfiltration  of  the  Workers' Party in  1984  by  a  group  of\r\n\r\nMarxists  after discussion with one Paul Lim Wah Chye,  Tan  Wah\r\n\r\nPiow,  fellow  Marxists  and  other  activists.   She  had  also\r\n\r\nactively  assisted  them in their efforts to  make  use  of  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party as a vehicle to further the Marxist's cause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ever, Mr Deputy Speaker, there was a fairy tale\r\n\r\nimprovisation, this was it.  All that Miss Teo Soh Lung did  was\r\n\r\nto  help  out  a little in our election campaign in  1984.   She\r\n\r\ndecided  as  a  citizen that she should help a  candidate  in  a\r\n\r\nconstituency.  She was not a member of the Party but  called  to\r\n\r\nhelp,  bring  about a better Singapore by trying to  provide  an\r\n\r\nalternative voice in Singapore, and that is why she  was  picked\r\n\r\nup.   And  then  the Government built up this  huge  edifice  of\r\n\r\nMarxist conspiracy, to infiltrate the Workers' Party - honestly,\r\n\r\nit  is a lot of nonsense, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.  I was in  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party  and I was then the leader.   But  that  is  the\r\n\r\nallegation against her.  When she appeared before the  Committee\r\n\r\nof  Privileges  of  this House, because she  had  called  for  a\r\n\r\nresolution  among  the  members of  the  Bar  to  criticise  the\r\n\r\nrestriction in the Newspaper and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPrinting  Presses  Bill  that  was  then  introduced,  she   was\r\n\r\nquestioned by the Committee of Privileges on all these.  She was\r\n\r\ntold  that she could not continue to be a member of the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty,  which she was not, and also a member of the  Council  of\r\n\r\nthe Law Society.  Again one of the grounds was that she made use\r\n\r\nof  the  Law  Society.   So that is why she  was  detained,  not\r\n\r\nbecause  she  was  organising  groups  to  commit  violence   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  not  organising, going round urging  people  to  arm\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  attack the Government, but  simply  because  she\r\n\r\nhelped  in the election efforts of a registered political  party\r\n\r\nand  was also trying to promote concern among the lawyers of the\r\n\r\nrestriction on foreign papers circulating in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that shows you the hollowness of the power that was used\r\n\r\nunder  the Internal Security Act to detain her.  It had no basis\r\n\r\nat   all.   Then  you  have  got  the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Act,  and that gives the Government  the  power  to\r\n\r\ndetain  persons for one year at a time.  Under this Act,  it  is\r\n\r\naimed  at persons who are alleged to be associated with criminal\r\n\r\nactivities  and who apparently cannot be brought to trial.   One\r\n\r\nman, who was a trade unionist himself, was charged in the courts\r\n\r\nwith  conspiracy to cause hurt to Mr Phey Yew Kok who is now  in\r\n\r\nhiding  somewhere.  He was acquitted.  The court threw the  case\r\n\r\nout saying that there was not a shred of evidence at the end  of\r\n\r\nthe  prosecution's case.  What happened to the man?  Immediately\r\n\r\nafter the acquittal, he was arrested and he spent about 10 years\r\n\r\nin prison.  So much for the Rule of Law in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the fear maintained or applied through the\r\n\r\nprovision  of housing.  Housing has become a political  tool  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  You have got to be on your good behaviour, otherwise\r\n\r\nyou  may not get your house or you may stand in danger of losing\r\n\r\nit.  There was an instance of a couple some years ago, where the\r\n\r\nwife refused to undergo sterilisation after the second child was\r\n\r\nborn.   They decided that their religion forbade them, and  they\r\n\r\npersistently refused.  This was at the time\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Government was promoting the two-child  policy  which\r\n\r\nthey  later  threw out realising that they had made  a  grievous\r\n\r\nmistake.   This couple kept refusing.  One fine day  they  found\r\n\r\nthemselves served with a notice, giving them seven days  to  get\r\n\r\nout of their HDB apartment - I think they were paying rent - and\r\n\r\nthey  refused to move.  Then a summons was issued requiring them\r\n\r\nto  appear in court for an application on the part of the HDB to\r\n\r\nrepossess  the  apartment.  But after a defence  was  filed  and\r\n\r\nafter  some  time, they probably thought better of  it  and  the\r\n\r\nsummons was withdrawn.  That was when the HDB still had to go to\r\n\r\ncourt.   But  now  the HDB does not have to go to  court  if  it\r\n\r\nwishes  to  repossess.  I think it is section 58 of the  Housing\r\n\r\nand Development Act where an occupier, whether he be a tenant or\r\n\r\na  lessee, can be dispossessed for a number of reasons.  The HDB\r\n\r\ncan retake the property and it does not have to apply to court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what protection does a houseowner have? And the PAP\r\n\r\nboasts that Singapore is a society of houseowners.  The HDB acts\r\n\r\nas  the  accuser;  it  acts as the judge; and  it  acts  as  the\r\n\r\nexecutioner.    It   decides  whether  the  person   should   be\r\n\r\ndispossessed and then he is told he can appeal to HDB and  again\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister,  and that is final.  And  if  the  appeal  is\r\n\r\nrejected,  he has to go.  And if he does not go, the  tenant  or\r\n\r\noccupier  would be forcibly thrown out.  So is there any  wonder\r\n\r\nthat  people live in fear?  The uppermost question is,  \"Are  we\r\n\r\ndoing  anything that might offend our rulers, our benign  rulers\r\n\r\nin this country?  Are we conforming to all they want?  Or are we\r\n\r\nshowing signs of being independent ourselves?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have the method of Ministers rapping people over\r\n\r\ntheir  knuckles if they should so much as express  criticism  in\r\n\r\nthe papers or speak.  There was the case of a writer who wrote a\r\n\r\nfeature  article  in  the Straits Times weekly.   Suddenly,  she\r\n\r\nfound  herself  rapped  by the Prime Minister  because  she  had\r\n\r\nwritten  about the disaffection between the PAP and the  people.\r\n\r\nAnd she was told off in no uncertain terms, \"If you want to take\r\n\r\nus on, go into politics, otherwise shut up.\".  After that, there\r\n\r\nwas no more article from her in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nStraits Times.  And, of course, the bosses at Times House  would\r\n\r\nnot dare to print anything more after that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have the recent example of the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ncriticising  the  businessmen  who  criticised  the   off-Budget\r\n\r\nmeasures.   So  there  you have it.  You  are  not  supposed  to\r\n\r\ncriticise  the Government where it hurts.  You can  always  sing\r\n\r\nthe praises of the Government but you cannot criticise them.  If\r\n\r\nyou criticise them, you take the consequences, and you know what\r\n\r\nthe  consequences  are.  You can be locked  up.   Your  business\r\n\r\nmight suffer.  You may lose your house.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the other technique, if I may call it \"technique\", is\r\n\r\nthrough the powers given to the income tax authorities.  Mdm Teo\r\n\r\nSiew  Har,  the wife of Mr Tang Liang Hong, was going across  to\r\n\r\nJohor,  not  running away, but she was suddenly stopped  at  the\r\n\r\nWoodlands Checkpoint and her passport was unlawfully taken  away\r\n\r\nfrom  her.   And this was apparently on the direction  from  the\r\n\r\nincome  tax  authorities.  There was  nothing,  as  I  told  the\r\n\r\nMinister when I questioned him on this last year, in the  Income\r\n\r\nTax Act which gave the Commissioner power to stop anyone leaving\r\n\r\nSingapore  unless that person owed income tax to the Government.\r\n\r\nBut  Mdm  Teo Siew Har was not paying any tax, she did  not  owe\r\n\r\nanything.  So there are these fears.  People know about  it  and\r\n\r\nit  is  no  good  pretending that these fears do  not  exist  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I briefly run through the law. This power of detention,\r\n\r\nwhich  is now found in the Internal Security Act (ISA), had  its\r\n\r\norigin in the Emergency Regulations.  That was introduced by the\r\n\r\nBritish  at  a time when there was a real threat.  There  was  a\r\n\r\nthreat  of  communist subversion.  But it  was  intended  to  be\r\n\r\npurely a temporary measure, only for three months at that  time,\r\n\r\nand the Assembly had to ratify it.  I shall later, when I reply,\r\n\r\nread  to you something about what the Leader of the PAP was then\r\n\r\nsaying about all these Regulations and the power, because  I  do\r\n\r\nnot have the time now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr Marshall's government took over, Mr Marshall\r\n\r\nrealised what a drastic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npower it was, that violated all rules of natural justice but  he\r\n\r\nalso  realised  that there was a need and he set  up  an  Appeal\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, some of the points you\r\n\r\nare making, you are tediously repeating yourself.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am now looking at the law, Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Come to the point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am looking at the law, not the instances\r\n\r\nof how it is applied.  I am going to tell you about the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> All right, carry on. Make it short.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> But when the PAP took over, three months\r\n\r\nafter it took over, they swept aside the Appeal Tribunal because\r\n\r\nthe  Appeal  Tribunal had the power to release  anyone  detained\r\n\r\nunder that power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am spelling out what the law is\r\n\r\nand  I was not talking about the law until now.  Section 8  says\r\n\r\n\"acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of Singapore.\"\r\n\r\nThat  is as vague and nebulous as you can get.  It has been used\r\n\r\nas  though  it  was meant to be read as \"acting  in  any  manner\r\n\r\nprejudicial to the People's Action Party.\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then under section 74, the Police have the power to detain\r\n\r\nanyone  under  that Act for 28 days.  No one  disputes  that  in\r\n\r\ntimes of national emergency, in times of threats to the country,\r\n\r\ndrastic  powers may be necessary.  But the Constitution provides\r\n\r\nfor  that situation and it is in Part XII, Articles 149 to  151.\r\n\r\nIt  says that if Parliament is satisfied that there is a threat,\r\n\r\nthat there is real danger to the country, then it may enact laws\r\n\r\nto  detain  persons.   But  that, again,  is  temporary,  to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed  every three months and to be repealed as soon  as  the\r\n\r\nthreat passes over.  So you got it under the Constitution.   You\r\n\r\ndo  not have to have it as a permanent section of the law in the\r\n\r\nstatute book.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a moot point whether this power contained in section\r\n\r\n8 is ultra vires the Constitution, taking into consideration\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nArticles  149  to 151.  I know that the Government  amended  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  to exempt the ISA.  But it is still a  moot  point\r\n\r\nwhether  this power is ultra vires the Constitution.   Then  you\r\n\r\nhave  got  the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act  which  I\r\n\r\nhave been talking about.  It was intended to be temporary.   But\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  Government gave it life for 34 years after  they  took\r\n\r\nover  and then extended it in 1989 and 1994 for five years at  a\r\n\r\ntime,  and so it will expire next year, and I have no  doubt  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  extended again.  That was intended to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nsecret  society menace.  But now it has become permanent and  is\r\n\r\nused very effectively against persons, persons who are picked up\r\n\r\nby  the Police are threatened that if they did not admit to what\r\n\r\nthey  are  suspected of, they can be detained under section  30.\r\n\r\nDo  you  want that?  You get an idea of how effective it  is  to\r\n\r\nkeep  people in fear and suppress them.  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  know whether I have got many more minutes  left  but\r\n\r\nbefore I\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I think I have given you too much time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Have I passed my one hour because I have\r\n\r\ngot some questions.  May I put the questions before I sit down?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Quickly put your questions then.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. I\r\n\r\nwould like the Minister replying to answer these questions and I\r\n\r\nhope  some  attempt  is  made to grapple  seriously  with  these\r\n\r\nquestions and not just dismiss them.  My first question is:   is\r\n\r\nthere  any evidence that there are groups in Singapore  plotting\r\n\r\nan organised sabotage of our society that requires Government to\r\n\r\nretain  this  power?   The  second question  is:  is  there  any\r\n\r\nevidence  of  preparation for terrorist activities?   The  third\r\n\r\nquestion is: why is the law of the land inadequate to deal  with\r\n\r\nactivities  threatening harmony and peace in  the  society?   We\r\n\r\nhave got the laws.  So why do we need these arbitrary detentions\r\n\r\nby  the Government?  And the final question is:  as a matter  of\r\n\r\npolicy, will the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment  announce immediately if anyone is  picked  up  under\r\n\r\nsection 74 of the Act by the Police, giving the reasons why  the\r\n\r\nperson  has been picked up and revealing his identity?   Because\r\n\r\nall this is done in secrecy.  The people are left in the dark as\r\n\r\nto  how  many persons have been picked up under section  74  and\r\n\r\nthen  released  before  the 28 days are up,  because  they  have\r\n\r\nsigned  the  bond or agreed to be good men and women, conforming\r\n\r\nto everything that the Government has to say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I just say that this is no\r\n\r\nbasis for a society which professes itself to be democratic.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  hollow claim that we are a democratic society founded  on\r\n\r\nthe  principles  of  justice and founded on  the  principles  of\r\n\r\nfreedom when our people live under all this real fear.  It is  a\r\n\r\nhollow claim and I think it is time that we decided to be honest\r\n\r\nwith ourselves and remove the fear from our people's lives.   We\r\n\r\ncan  then  go into the 21st century as a proud people, a  people\r\n\r\nwho  are not afraid, a people who know what their rights are,  a\r\n\r\npeople  who  know  that  they will not be deprived  of  anything\r\n\r\nexcept  under  the Rule of Law, ie, they would  be  tried  by  a\r\n\r\ncompetent court and convicted before they are put into prison or\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  their goods or property or punished  in  any  way.\r\n\r\nThen we can be a proud society.  But if we continue as we are, I\r\n\r\ndo  not see how we can be a proud society.  I do not see how  we\r\n\r\ncan   progress   economically  with  our   people   denied   any\r\n\r\nparticipation in the decision making process of our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to respond to Mr J B Jeyaretnam because I believe it is not\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  fear  in people's lives  in  Singapore,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam puts it, although there is indeed a fear amongst many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  speak their mind.  There is a perception  that\r\n\r\npublic  criticism of official policies is not welcomed,  brought\r\n\r\nabout by a legacy of the past.  However, this is not necessarily\r\n\r\nan indication of things to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent introduction of more and wider channels of\r\n\r\ncommunication and a more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nopen  attitude  towards  public  participation  gives  hope  and\r\n\r\njustifies  a  more  optimistic  attitude  in  the  future.   For\r\n\r\nexample, Government's suspicion towards civil groups may  be  an\r\n\r\nunderstandable  legacy  of the past when pro-Communist  elements\r\n\r\ntook guise of various societies, but this attitude has to change\r\n\r\nfor the future of civil society.  Therefore, we must be clear as\r\n\r\nto  what kind of fear that prevails in our society.  Fear exists\r\n\r\nin  so  far  as  the  public  perceives  the  Government  to  be\r\n\r\nconstantly  on  the  look out for dissenters  and  also  out  of\r\n\r\nrespect  for  our  preventive detention laws.   This  perception\r\n\r\ncould also be due to the existence of red tapes covering a  wide\r\n\r\nrange  of  registration and licensing laws  on  registration  of\r\n\r\nsocieties,  organisation of public meetings and  publication  of\r\n\r\nnewsletters  - that tend to discourage citizens' initiative  and\r\n\r\ndo  little  to demonstrate the increasing tolerance of differing\r\n\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that in most cases fear is exaggerated.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans tend to exaggerate the harm that will come to  them\r\n\r\nif   they   voice  critical  views.   However,   it   is   quite\r\n\r\nunderstandable  and natural for Singaporeans  to  get  a  little\r\n\r\nparanoid.  This is because the Government, to my knowledge,  has\r\n\r\nnever  told Singaporeans unconditionally that they have  nothing\r\n\r\nto   fear  when  speaking  out.   Yes,  there  have  been   many\r\n\r\ninvitations extended to Singaporeans to express their views, but\r\n\r\nthese  are usually conditional.  Singaporeans are told to  speak\r\n\r\nfreely  as long as they are constructive and respectful  of  our\r\n\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may seem, on the surface, to be quite a reasonable\r\n\r\ncondition  but,  in  fact, it places an onerous  burden  on  the\r\n\r\nordinary   citizens.    Who   decides   whether   criticism   is\r\n\r\nconstructive or respectful?  It is only the citizen himself  who\r\n\r\nknows  his  own  motives.  But we must be very  careful  not  to\r\n\r\nattribute  these  fears  simply on  historical  occurrences,  on\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  on  politics.  Fear, in this  case,  is  also  a\r\n\r\ncultural  phenomenon.  Fear, in Singapore, is  instilled  early,\r\n\r\nfrom  when a child goes to school and taught that failure brings\r\n\r\nshame on himself and his family, that an academic performance is\r\n\r\nthe hallmark of excellence and his worth is judged mainly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  his  examination results.  Ask any school  teacher  or  even\r\n\r\nbosses  in  commercial practice on how difficult it  is  to  get\r\n\r\npeople  to  speak up, especially when it is against  established\r\n\r\nnorms  and practices.  Even participants and members of feedback\r\n\r\ngroups that were formed under the Feedback Unit, of which I am a\r\n\r\nmember,  had  initially expressed fears about  expressing  their\r\n\r\nviews  despite  the  fact that these channels  were  established\r\n\r\nsimply  for that reason - to gather honest and considered  views\r\n\r\nfrom a wide cross-section of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these participants are themselves very surprised by\r\n\r\nthe  absence  of  any  form of restriction  or  censorship  when\r\n\r\npresenting  their  views  on  politics  and  media.   Some  were\r\n\r\npleasantly  surprised that their recommendations were  presented\r\n\r\nin this case to the Chairman of the Singapore 21 Committee.  Let\r\n\r\nme  highlight  a  few of these suggestions to  demonstrate  that\r\n\r\ncarefully  considered views of non-partisan citizens  have  been\r\n\r\ngiven its attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) For example, parliamentary reform. Mr J B Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nmay be pleased to know of suggestions to increase the number  of\r\n\r\nNCMPs  or Opposition Members in Parliament to form at least  10%\r\n\r\nof the total number of MPs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Press freedom to allow more and alternative views to\r\n\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Balanced reporting of Parliamentary debates to\r\n\r\nhighlight alternative views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) A more open political climate and the need to change\r\n\r\nthe  Government mindset to allow expressions of political  views\r\n\r\nwithout fear of being chastised for meddling in politics.\r\n\r\nThese  are  very  serious  but  carefully  considered  views  of\r\n\r\nordinary  citizens.  I must say that many of  the  members  were\r\n\r\npleasantly  surprised that while their views may  be  considered\r\n\r\nradical  and  brave, it was received without the  robustness  of\r\n\r\nresponse that in the past some may have come to expect.  To  me,\r\n\r\nthis  represents  a  significant  development  in  creating   an\r\n\r\nenvironment where freedom of expression can thrive even when the\r\n\r\nviews do not represent the accepted norms of the day.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is important now is to spread the message and\r\n\r\nconfidence among all Singaporeans that there exist in  Singapore\r\n\r\nopportunities   where  ordinary  citizens  can  participate   in\r\n\r\ndecision making without fear or reprisals.  Therefore, the long-term  solution  to  this climate of fear is  to  re-educate  our\r\n\r\npeople and to allow them to realise that it is all right not  to\r\n\r\nconform,  that  their pecuniary interests  and  those  of  their\r\n\r\nfamily members are not affected by their actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elimination of fear factor is overall a good thing\r\n\r\nsince  a  creative and vibrant, not to mention  competitive  and\r\n\r\ninnovative,  society  can only thrive in  an  environment  where\r\n\r\nmistakes  are forgiven and non-conformity tolerated  generously.\r\n\r\nIt  also  requires  the Government to change their  mindset  and\r\n\r\nparadigms,  because what  might otherwise be  negative  energies\r\n\r\ncan  be  harnessed for the good of society in general.  This  is\r\n\r\nespecially  important in view of the fact that  time  and  again\r\n\r\nwhen issues of freedom of expression surfaced, the Catherine Lim\r\n\r\naffair would not be far from the minds of most Singaporeans.  Mr\r\n\r\nJ B Jeyaretnam referred to her in his speech.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, nothing really happened to Catherine Lim after\r\n\r\nshe  wrote  her two political commentaries.  She was not  locked\r\n\r\nup, sued, fined or anything like that.  All she got was a verbal\r\n\r\nresponse  and a challenge for her to join politics if  she  felt\r\n\r\nstrongly against the Government.  While some may think that this\r\n\r\nwas   a  reasonable  response,  others,  especially  the  better\r\n\r\neducated, still refer to the Catherine Lim affair as an  example\r\n\r\nof Government's intolerance to criticism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catherine Lim is an accomplished professional writer. If\r\n\r\neven  her words and motives can be misconstrued, then what  hope\r\n\r\ndo  other  Singaporeans have of getting their points across?   I\r\n\r\nthink  this is what alarms Singaporeans.  You have to be careful\r\n\r\nin  what you say, should you not be misunderstood.  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfear the risk of getting a disproportionate response.  It is not\r\n\r\nsurprising  therefore  that some Singaporeans  feel  fearful  to\r\n\r\nspeak out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fact remains that it takes courage, bravery and an\r\n\r\nelement of thick-skinned stubbornness to stand up and be counted\r\n\r\nfor  one's  views,  especially when they are at  odds  with  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  norms  of society.  It is for society  as  a  whole  to\r\n\r\nattach  a  positive  value to someone speaking  his  conscience,\r\n\r\nbecause  what is worse is to have Singaporeans who  are  passive\r\n\r\nand  disinterested.  It is also for the man himself to be  ready\r\n\r\nto  receive  and accept criticisms and rebuttals on views  which\r\n\r\nare  made  public so long as they do not develop  into  personal\r\n\r\nattacks and vendettas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure to remove the perception would reinforce the\r\n\r\nthinking   that  opposition  and  disagreement   do   not   pay.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmingly,  the  economic  animal  in  the  Singaporean  is\r\n\r\nencouraged  and his rational side tells him that politics  is  a\r\n\r\ndirty  game  and we should not meddle in it, just in  case.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to remove this perception.  I am, however, confident  that\r\n\r\ngiven  time,  as more people become familiar and be involved  in\r\n\r\nthe  existing channels, many of the perceptions that we now have\r\n\r\nwill  slowly  disappear.  If developments in the  past  are  any\r\n\r\nindication   of   the   future,  we  can   look   forward   more\r\n\r\noptimistically and assure ourselves that freedom  of  expression\r\n\r\nis alive and kicking in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to Mr J B Jeyaretnam's suggestion to abolish\r\n\r\nall  detentions  without trial.  I suppose in an  ideal  society\r\n\r\nwithout   threats  of  racial  and  religious   chauvinism   and\r\n\r\nextremism,   intimidation,  rumour  mongering  and   underground\r\n\r\nclandestine  operations, there will be no need for the  Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Act  (ISA).  I for one, however, feel that  our  young\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  society,  having  just  got  out  of  racial   and\r\n\r\nCommunist threats, cannot take the attitude that these  problems\r\n\r\nwhich  have  necessitated the introduction of ISA in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace are now completely behind us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we have relative peace and freedom from some\r\n\r\nof these extremist problems makes it all the more important that\r\n\r\nISA  should  be retained.  Clearly, one can argue  that  ISA  is\r\n\r\nindeed extreme, but we should take comfort that it is needed to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe used against extremists and under extreme circumstances.  The\r\n\r\nISA is not meant to be  used to restrict political opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to suggest that we consider\r\n\r\namendments that would allow for greater accessibility and checks\r\n\r\nand balances to have a more transparent judicial scrutiny and to\r\n\r\nmake  the Executive more accountable for their actions.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nwe   should  consider  removing  the  fetter  of  the   judicial\r\n\r\ninterpretation imposed in Article 149(3) of the Constitution and\r\n\r\nsections 8(a) and 8(b) of the ISA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the combined effects of these provisions fix\r\n\r\nthe  law of judicial reviews of executive detention to 13th July\r\n\r\n1971,  which is the date of the decision in the case of Lee  Mau\r\n\r\nSeng  v  Minister for Home Affairs was rendered.  In that  case,\r\n\r\nthe  High Court held that the test to be used in determining the\r\n\r\nlegality of the decision to detain was a subjective one and  not\r\n\r\nan  objective test.  That is, the courts cannot ask or  question\r\n\r\nthe  basis,  grounds  and allegations for  the  detention  of  a\r\n\r\nperson.  This has effectively overruled the earlier decision  of\r\n\r\nthe Court of Appeal to have an objective test as in the case  of\r\n\r\ncountries like UK, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest that we review Article 151(4) of the\r\n\r\nConstitution  to  provide a tribunal to review detentions  under\r\n\r\nthe  ISA  be made up of High Court Judges who enjoy security  of\r\n\r\ntenure  and remuneration.  This will ensure the greatest  degree\r\n\r\nof impartiality possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the ISA is no doubt extreme, but it\r\n\r\nhas  served  us  well  in  dealing with extremists  and  extreme\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   The ISA today is still relevant  and  necessary\r\n\r\nfor peace and stability of our society.  And for that, Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, given the time, I\r\n\r\nshall try and give my comments as briefly as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried my best to listen carefully to both the NCMP who\r\n\r\nmoved the motion and to the speaker before me, NMP Mr Zulkifli.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBut  I  want to differ from some of their comments.  I am not  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  any political party, neither the PAP nor opposition.\r\n\r\nI  wish instead to focus my comments about ordinary citizens and\r\n\r\ncivil  society in Singapore and then about preventive  detention\r\n\r\nwhich  I  teach as part of constitutional law in the Faculty  of\r\n\r\nLaw.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we citizens fear? If so, why? Conversely, should the\r\n\r\nGovernment on behalf of the nation fear and, if so, why?   Those\r\n\r\nare  the  central questions I come to.  And in addressing  these\r\n\r\nquestions, let me differ also from the NCMP, in focusing not  so\r\n\r\nmuch on the past, but on the present day and perhaps some of the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is true that some citizens do not speak up or\r\n\r\nparticipate,  or  do not speak up much or participate  much.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  also  true, in today's Singapore,  that  this  is\r\n\r\nchanging.   Polls have consistently shown that more Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwant a say in the policies of the country and this is especially\r\n\r\ntrue of younger Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A youth conference in the early 1990s was quoted in the\r\n\r\npapers  as saying that the participants feared speaking  up  and\r\n\r\ntherefore had no ideas.  Today, youth conferences give frank and\r\n\r\noften  well-thought  through proposals, in detail,  in  writing.\r\n\r\nThis  has  been my experience in working with the  Singapore  21\r\n\r\nCommittee,  of which I am a member (although I do not  represent\r\n\r\ntheir views here).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me, fear is a very big word and the preventive\r\n\r\ndetention  laws do not sufficiently explain why Singaporeans  do\r\n\r\nnot  participate more, or more Singaporeans do not  participate.\r\n\r\nBecause  the  polls that showed the people want  to  participate\r\n\r\nmore also showed that Singaporeans trust the Government and they\r\n\r\nexpect the Government to solve their problems for them.  That is\r\n\r\nalso clear.  These two things are not contradictory.  Rather the\r\n\r\ntrust of people means that people expect the Government to think\r\n\r\nand  do everything for them.  In some ways, there is the culture\r\n\r\nof  over-dependence combined with the culture of  complaint,  to\r\n\r\nsit  back  and  complain.   This  breeds  a  certain  tidak  apa\r\n\r\nattitude.  Singaporeans expect others to do something for  them,\r\n\r\nthe Government to do something for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is also true, however, there is something that I\r\n\r\nhave learnt to call the \"black book\" factor.  That people do not\r\n\r\nspeak  up, not so much because they fear detention or jail,  but\r\n\r\nbecause  of smaller concerns, about not being in someone's  good\r\n\r\nbooks,  in  being  in  a \"black book\".  It  is  true  that  non-politicians  who  have spoken up have faced very  strong  robust\r\n\r\nresponses.  As Mr Zulkifli Baharudin has said before  me,  there\r\n\r\nis  no  promise  today that we have a free for  all.   So  today\r\n\r\npeople  who  speak up risk being seen as engaging  in  politics,\r\n\r\nthey risk being publicly scolded.  I think this should change in\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to move towards consultation which we have seen,\r\n\r\nand from there, to a greater sense of participation.  We need to\r\n\r\nbuild  up Singapore's heartware, we need to build up Singapore's\r\n\r\ncivil  society.  This is the utility of freeing people from  the\r\n\r\n\"black   book\"  syndrome  and  encouraging  their   speech   and\r\n\r\nparticipation,  to  give  people  a  sense  of  ownership,  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  their  home.  If it  is  our  home,  we  must  be\r\n\r\ncomfortable  here.  We must be able to speak  freely.   We  must\r\n\r\nhave  a  part  in deciding how to do things, how to arrange  the\r\n\r\nfurniture in our home, and also we must have a hand in doing the\r\n\r\nchores  around the house.  We must do things for ourselves.   To\r\n\r\nencourage  this, I urge the Government to be more  tolerant  and\r\n\r\nhave a greater acceptance of differing points of view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn then, with this view, to the particular concern\r\n\r\nof  the  motion  of preventive detention.  Is  it  necessary  to\r\n\r\nabolish all detentions without trial?  In Singapore, besides the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security  Act,  there is the Criminal  Law  (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Act (CLTPA), Maintenance of Religious  Harmony  Act\r\n\r\nand the Misuse of Drugs Act, which have similar laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me focus first on the ISA. Mr Jeyaretnam has given the\r\n\r\noriginal  justification  and that  it  was  inherited  from  the\r\n\r\nBritish.   Some may feel that there is a change of circumstance,\r\n\r\nthat today there is no serious threat of criminal unrest.  But I\r\n\r\nthink it is necessary to point out that very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfew  countries which had inherited this law have got rid  of  it\r\n\r\nentirely.   More so, that universal human rights  recognise  the\r\n\r\nright   of countries to retain such laws of preventive detention\r\n\r\nin  times of emergency, in times when the life of the nation  is\r\n\r\nunder  threat.  It is true that Singapore's ISA laws differ,  in\r\n\r\nthe  sense  that judicial review is limited.  The judiciary  can\r\n\r\nonly  comment  on  the  procedure  of  detention  and  not   the\r\n\r\nsubstance.  The review is instead by an advisory board.  But the\r\n\r\npoint  is  that  international law, human  rights  law  and  the\r\n\r\npractice  of  many  countries accepts  that  there  need  to  be\r\n\r\nemergency powers for the state to genuinely intervene when there\r\n\r\nis  a  problem.   Even the USA and UK, two western  democracies,\r\n\r\nhave  clear war time cases in which courts have not ventured  to\r\n\r\nsecond  guess  the Executive, even if they have technically  the\r\n\r\npower  of review.  The US cases on Americans of Japanese origins\r\n\r\nwho  were  interred during World War II for no crime other  than\r\n\r\nthe  fact that they were of Japanese origin.  The United Kingdom\r\n\r\ncase  of Liversidge v Anderson, which has been affirmed  by  our\r\n\r\nown  legal  system.   Given this inheritance,  we  have  to  ask\r\n\r\nourselves, \"Is preventive detention now outmoded?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that clearly in the Criminal Law (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Act,  which  is used against  suspected  criminals,\r\n\r\nmainly  gangs, we have to recognise that with a largely  Chinese\r\n\r\npopulation,  many cities in the world have faced  a  problem  in\r\n\r\ntackling crime.  Next, in the Misuse of Drugs Act, where  it  is\r\n\r\nused  for suspected addicts to search, subject them to test  and\r\n\r\nthen  to  treatment.  I think our Government is correct  in  not\r\n\r\nmaking  apologies for this, because drugs remain a problem,  and\r\n\r\nwe are very close to one of the centres of the drug trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, where\r\n\r\nreligious  leaders mix with politics in an explosive element,  I\r\n\r\nthink again there is a real danger in a multi-religious society.\r\n\r\nThat  leaves me mainly with the Internal Security Act which,  as\r\n\r\ncorrectly pointed out, was originally intended to deal with  the\r\n\r\ncommunist threat.  I want to point out that it is not in use  at\r\n\r\npresent except for Mr Chia Thye\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPoh,  who is out of physical detention, still under supervision,\r\n\r\neven  though  allowed abroad today.  Should  it  be  revoked  as\r\n\r\noutmoded  today?   Or should be it kept in reserve  in  case  of\r\n\r\nemergency?  For in recent events, the countries around  us  have\r\n\r\nshown,   emergencies  arise  exactly  as  the   word   suggests,\r\n\r\n\"emergency\", urgently.  That is also our history.  We  have  all\r\n\r\nconcerns  and we are a young society.  I think it is  true  that\r\n\r\npolicemen  have  guns, even if they are trained that  the  first\r\n\r\nresponse is not to reach for that gun.  I think that analogy can\r\n\r\napply  to  the ISA so long as every use of the ISA is  explained\r\n\r\nand  checked  by  either the courts or  by  public  opinion.   I\r\n\r\nmention  the word \"public opinion\" because it comes back  to  my\r\n\r\npoint  about trust.  That if there is trust, as the  polls  have\r\n\r\nshown  in  the Government, then the ISA too can be subjected  to\r\n\r\nthe trust of public opinion and to the courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want to question this more. Is the ISA a real\r\n\r\nobstacle to speech and participation?  I want to point out  that\r\n\r\nin  comparison  to many countries with similar laws,  relatively\r\n\r\nfew people have been detained in Singapore, and that the ISA, in\r\n\r\nmy view, is often more an excuse for the tidak apa attitude, the\r\n\r\nindifference and inaction of citizens.  But I also want  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the ISA should not be a sacred cow in Singapore.  I  think\r\n\r\nan amendment to allow a judicial review  or its abolition should\r\n\r\nbe  considered in the future.  As our society knits more closely\r\n\r\ntogether,  as  dangers recede, as bad memories are  confined  to\r\n\r\nhistory  and  a  history we are not doomed to  repeat  but  have\r\n\r\nlearnt to grow stronger from, when those conditions prevail,  we\r\n\r\nmust reconsider this law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we get to that point in the future? I believe we\r\n\r\nneed to work on building trust and responsibility.  This applies\r\n\r\nto  both sides.  Mr Zulkifli Baharudin has spoken about some  of\r\n\r\nthe concerns that people still have, not so much of the ISA, but\r\n\r\nof  being  scolded.  People must trust that the Government  will\r\n\r\nlisten fairly and act fairly.  The Government, on its part, must\r\n\r\ntrust  that  citizens  will  exercise  their  rights  to  speech\r\n\r\nresponsibly.  This trust is not automatic.  It is earned.  There\r\n\r\nis no free licence.  Government must respond and engage.  If\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nan  argument is wrong, it must continue to tell us why it thinks\r\n\r\nso.   An example was brought up by Mr Jeyaretnam about the reply\r\n\r\nrecently by the Prime Minister to developers who have asked  for\r\n\r\nvarious  concessions.   I  am not convinced  at  all  that  this\r\n\r\nexample is one of fear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that businesses will continue to speak up.\r\n\r\nThey need not fear.  If they are organised, they will speak  up.\r\n\r\nThey  are not incarcerated, they are not \"blackbooked\"  in  some\r\n\r\nway.   I think that it is right for the Government to point  out\r\n\r\nto  the  national  interest, rather than to  sectoral  interest.\r\n\r\nThese  people  will  not be intimidated  easily.   But  for  the\r\n\r\nordinary   citizens,  not  the  organised  business  groups,   I\r\n\r\nencourage  the  Government to exercise  a  greater  kindness,  a\r\n\r\ngreater caution, a greater restraint, to reply with the  aim  of\r\n\r\npersuasion  and  to remember that the Government can  intimidate\r\n\r\neven if it does not intend to.  If the citizen is sincere and on\r\n\r\nthe issue, I hope the Government will respond likewise.  In that\r\n\r\nsense,  I hope for the evolution of certain rules of engagement,\r\n\r\nnot  just  among  Government leaders, but also  with  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice,  to take ideas seriously and respond to them  seriously\r\n\r\nand with a sincerity equal to what they are given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give two quick examples from my own experience. The\r\n\r\nfirst  is of the Roundtable, a non-governmental organisation  of\r\n\r\nwhich I am a member, and Mr Zulkifli Baharudin is the President.\r\n\r\nThe  Roundtable offered its post-election analysis that  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  reasons the PAP had succeeded so much in this election  was\r\n\r\nbecause  of something we called \"package politics\".  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe   PAP   is  free  to  disagree  with  our  analysis.    Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have disagreed with our analysis.  The point I want\r\n\r\nto bring up today is not about whether we were right or wrong in\r\n\r\nour  analysis,  but the reply of government.  The Government  in\r\n\r\nits  reply,  or  the  Minister or a member of  the  PAP  in  his\r\n\r\npersonal  capacity replied.   Mr Lim Boon Heng responded  to  us\r\n\r\nsubstantively on the points we raised.  Only,  I would  say,  on\r\n\r\nthree words, there was a sense of what people might think of  as\r\n\r\nintimidation.  The first, he called us \"PAP critics\" rather than\r\n\r\nsimply a commentator or critic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  politics as a whole.  Second, there was a very vague promise\r\n\r\nto take us on, and I do not think at that point he meant to take\r\n\r\nus  on in Parliament.  The third was that he question marked our\r\n\r\nnon-partisanship,  that  somehow  we  were  coloured  as   being\r\n\r\npredominantly  against the PAP.  Except for those three  points,\r\n\r\nthe right to reply was certainly fair.  Just as I had a right to\r\n\r\nspeak, the Minister certainly had a right to reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a second example, something which I think is a\r\n\r\nvery  promising example.  I do not know whether anyone remembers\r\n\r\nthe  Budget debate we were engaged in, for even longer days than\r\n\r\nthis.   I  spoke  briefly on the cut on  the  Ministry  of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  about  the Registry of Societies, and I encouraged  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of Societies to expedite registration of organisations\r\n\r\nin  order  that  we  might have a more  active  and  able  civil\r\n\r\nsociety.   In my comments, as an example of that, I  brought  up\r\n\r\nthe  Roundtable  and I mistakenly said that the  Roundtable  had\r\n\r\ntaken more than a year to register.  The comment was reported in\r\n\r\nthe  papers and the mistake was pointed out by the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nSocieties.   It was also admitted by the founding  President  of\r\n\r\nthe  Roundtable, Mr Raymond Lim, in a reply.  In the  reply,  he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Yes,  we  made a mistake, but please remember  our  main\r\n\r\npoint,  that  to  enable civil society,  we  must  have  quicker\r\n\r\nregistration.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Assoc. Prof. Ho\r\n\r\nPeng Kee, replied to me fairly in Parliament promising that that\r\n\r\nwould  be done, the main point would be addressed, that we  were\r\n\r\nall  of  one  mind, that this process needed to be  speeded  up.\r\n\r\nWhen  I learnt of my mistake, because I had been misinformed,  I\r\n\r\nwrote  to Assoc. Prof. Ho.  I have asked him before this whether\r\n\r\nI  can make reference to the letter, and he has agreed.  I wrote\r\n\r\nto  admit my mistake and to apologise, and explained that I  had\r\n\r\nnot  intended the mistake.  I also encourage him to focus on the\r\n\r\nmain  issue  on which we concurred.  I think today he  does  not\r\n\r\nbear  me  a  grudge and I hope I have not lost his respect.   In\r\n\r\nfact, I hope in a sense that this small example is something  we\r\n\r\ncan learn, that people can speak\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nup  for  good  motive, even if they make mistakes, and  then  be\r\n\r\naccepted for the main point and to move on from there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To widen this trust and such a responsibility will take\r\n\r\ntime.   I  think I am not alone in this.  I believe  that  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Goh's Government is sincere in wanting consultation and\r\n\r\nparticipation,  civil  society and the  people  sector.   And  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  the people's wish on their part  is  growing  for\r\n\r\nconsultation, participation and democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I cannot, with respect, support the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I did not intend\r\n\r\nto  speak,  but in view of certain allegations which  have  been\r\n\r\nmade  in  this House against lawyers, I think I owe  it  to  the\r\n\r\nHouse and to my profession to speak up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, if I remember correctly, Mr Tang Liang Hong\r\n\r\nhad  lawyers  to  represent him.  And if he chose  to  discharge\r\n\r\nthem, then of course he has to blame himself.  The fact that few\r\n\r\nlawyers  refused  to act for various reasons, whether  it  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of cost or that they do not want to act, it  is  their\r\n\r\nown  choice.  It does not mean that the legal profession is  not\r\n\r\nprepared to act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, the ISA, as he has rightly pointed out, has\r\n\r\na history.  It originated from the British.  Mr  David Marshall,\r\n\r\nwho was a great champion of civil liberty, moved an extension of\r\n\r\nthe law which allowed detention without trial in this House.  We\r\n\r\nknow  Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew was against it.  But when  he  attained\r\n\r\npower, he realised the importance of this legislation.  He  must\r\n\r\nhave  been professionally advised to carry on.  I can sympathise\r\n\r\nwith  ISA  being used against political detainees, but  have  we\r\n\r\nused it for the last three years?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government to consider amending the law so\r\n\r\nthat  there will be more judicial discretion.  But that  is  for\r\n\r\nthe  House  to decide.  As to the allegation that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nright of review in the High Court, the law is clear.  Parliament\r\n\r\nhas  passed the law.  The job of the High Court is to  interpret\r\n\r\nit.  Parliament is the supreme body, as Mr Jeyaretnam time\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  again  said, and this supreme body has passed a  law;  High\r\n\r\nCourt cannot change it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to a more fundamental issue, Sir, which I think my\r\n\r\nfellow  colleague, Mr Simon Tay has touched on.  This motion  is\r\n\r\nflawed  from  the very beginning.  You cannot have  all  persons\r\n\r\nfreed  of  detention  without trial for the simple  reason  that\r\n\r\nsecret  societies'  men are still active even  today.   I  am  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  SINDA.  When I visit schools, I am told that  school\r\n\r\nchildren are being recruited by secret societies.  Can we afford\r\n\r\nto allow these thugs roaming in the streets?  Surely not.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Shoot them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Well, if you want to shoot, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is what you want.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall not engage\r\n\r\nwith  him, because time is running out.  My position is,  detain\r\n\r\nthe  anti-social elements and rehabilitate them.  Some  of  them\r\n\r\nhave  come  out and have changed.  In fact, the secret societies\r\n\r\nare  active in other parts of the world.  It is increasing.   Do\r\n\r\nyou want it?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, both Mr Zulkifli and Mr Simon Tay\r\n\r\nhave  quite  extensively put the case - there is no  element  of\r\n\r\nfear,  it  is  the  individual who decides.   I  think  we,  the\r\n\r\nNominated MPs, have come into this House not to toe the line  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  We have come here to state our views, and this\r\n\r\nview  is  being stated by a Nominated Member, that we have  this\r\n\r\ndanger of communalists and religious bigots who are prepared  to\r\n\r\nstir  trouble.   In fact, this morning I will not mention  name,\r\n\r\nfrom  a  religious  group, one individual came  and  said,  \"The\r\n\r\nGovernment is after us.\"  He came unappointed, and I want to  be\r\n\r\ncourteous to him and I do not want to besmirch the name of  this\r\n\r\norganisation,  and he said, \"My organisation  is  delisted.\"   I\r\n\r\nsaid  I  could  speak to the Minister.  But to  say  that  every\r\n\r\nindividual has the right to practise as he likes cannot  be  so.\r\n\r\nSo  I  urge this House, Sir, to reject this motion.  I  did  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  speak,  but  because of certain  allegations,  certain\r\n\r\nmisconceptions will be conveyed outside this House, I have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndecided to speak.  I am asking this House to be careful  not  to\r\n\r\ndo  away  with the ISA altogether.  But I urge the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nreconsider  the  position.  We have moved further.   We  are  an\r\n\r\nenlightened  society,  and responsible  groups,  Roundtable  and\r\n\r\nother  groups, will blossom up.  Give them the opportunity.   In\r\n\r\nfact, I hope the Minister will give the figure to this House  on\r\n\r\nhow many political detainees we have for the last three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I say, in Tamil, romba nandri.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, it has been a long day. It\r\n\r\nis  a  long debate.  I will not tax Members' patience very much.\r\n\r\nBut  let  me  make a response.  First, this has  also  become  a\r\n\r\nstandard  line  of  mine,  but  it  is  the  truth,  because  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  once  again raises old issues.   Together  with  old\r\n\r\nissues, he will bring up old cases and even old rules - the  HDB\r\n\r\nsterilisation rule that no longer applies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act\r\n\r\n(CLTPA).  He was in the House in the 1980s, and if you  look  at\r\n\r\nthe  Hansard, he debated it fully.  Government gave a  response,\r\n\r\nmore recently in this House, I think last year in the debate  on\r\n\r\nthe President's Address.  He also mentioned then the point about\r\n\r\nfear, about the ISA and other preventive detention laws.  I also\r\n\r\ngave  him  a  reply.   Indeed, I think  the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,  Mr Wong Kan Seng, gave a written reply to  Mdm  Claire\r\n\r\nChiang as to whether the ISA should be abolished.  So these  are\r\n\r\nin  the  record.   But Mr Jeyaretnam, I think maybe  wanting  to\r\n\r\nretain  his  record of lodging motions in the  House  regularly,\r\n\r\nmoves  this motion.  Next year 1999, the Criminal Law (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions) Act will be up for extension.  Well, at that time we\r\n\r\ncan have a full debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before talking about preventive detention laws, let me\r\n\r\naddress  the other point about fear.  I think it is  very  clear\r\n\r\nthat even though the same word is used here, Mr Jeyaretnam's use\r\n\r\nof the word \"fear\" is vastly different from Mr Zulkifli's and Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay's.   Mr  Jeyaretnam would want  us  to  believe  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are gripped by fear, an oppressive fear.  And  this\r\n\r\nindeed is a recurrent theme of his, if\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyou  look  at  all his old speeches in the House  and  political\r\n\r\nrallies.   His  tune  never changes, even though  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nchanged  so  much, and these are highlighted in the speeches  of\r\n\r\nthe  other Members.  But it is a constant refrain, down  to  the\r\n\r\nvery  `t'  and `i', the knock at the door at 2.00 am.   So  this\r\n\r\nphrase is used all the time.  He also says some of the fears are\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by  coercion  by the  Government  and  mentioned\r\n\r\ninstances where people do not want to have anything to  do  with\r\n\r\nthe Workers' Party, whether it is businesses who do not want  to\r\n\r\nserve them, or people who do not want to join them in elections,\r\n\r\nand  he  blames it on the Government.  That it is  because  they\r\n\r\nfear the Government.  But I think Mr Jeyaretnam and the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  should  examine themselves.  Could it be  that  there  is\r\n\r\nsomething  in  them that puts these people off, not  wanting  to\r\n\r\nhave any dealings with the Workers' Party?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> They do not want to have business\r\n\r\ncontracts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Well, it is still a\r\n\r\nrelationship, right?  So they may not want to have  any  dealing\r\n\r\nwith him.  But why blame it on the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the truth of the matter is really\r\n\r\nSingapore  has prospered and progressed.  As has been  mentioned\r\n\r\nin  this  House,  we  have  become  a  more  open  society.   Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam wants us to believe that Singaporeans are  living  in\r\n\r\nthe dark ages.  He used the term \"unthinking\".  That the fear is\r\n\r\nso  gripping that we are \"unthinking\".  So what does that  mean?\r\n\r\nAll  robots?   He is in fact insulting the intelligence  of  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  that  we have all become robots  under  this  big\r\n\r\nbrother,  this  machine - the Government.  If  you  look  around\r\n\r\nSingapore,  all  the achievements which we have made  all  these\r\n\r\nyears,  are  all  these  the result of  an  unthinking,  robotic\r\n\r\npeople?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have become a role model for many societies. I think if\r\n\r\nhe  is  objective, if Mr Jeyaretnam reads the papers,  talks  to\r\n\r\npeople,  he  will know that many delegations visit Singapore  to\r\n\r\nlearn about many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naspects  of life in Singapore which incidentally have also  done\r\n\r\nvery  well  in international polls, whether it is town planning,\r\n\r\nwhether  it is the judicial system, whether it is amenities  and\r\n\r\nhealth care, whether it is educational achievements.  All  these\r\n\r\nare  not  the result of a people who are unthinking and  robotic\r\n\r\nbut  a  creative people.  Of course, we can improve and  we  are\r\n\r\nmoving towards that - to create and foster an even more creative\r\n\r\npeople.   Look  at our young people.  I think if  Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nlooks at the achievements of our young people, talks to the Dean\r\n\r\nof  the  Law Faculty, our young lawyers or law students  who  go\r\n\r\nabroad to do mooting, they win top honours.  Our young people go\r\n\r\noverseas,  take part in choral competition, they do  very  well.\r\n\r\nAll  these are the result of a people gripped by fear?   I  will\r\n\r\nask  Mr Jeyaretnam, please, to be realistic and not to be closed\r\n\r\nin his mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, of course, is that Singaporeans'\r\n\r\nexpectations have risen.  Every one of us who has dealings  with\r\n\r\nthe  average Singaporean will know that Singaporeans have become\r\n\r\nmore sophisticated; Singaporeans have become more demanding.   I\r\n\r\nthink  Members of Parliament will know that.  Are  these  people\r\n\r\nwho can just be led by the nose?  I think the answer is obvious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that Mr Tay, Mr Zulkifli and Mr Rai take a\r\n\r\ndifferent  tack.  They are not talking about an oppressive  fear\r\n\r\ngripping Singaporeans.  They are calling for a lighter touch  to\r\n\r\ngovernment,  more  bonding  with  the  government,   perhaps   a\r\n\r\ngovernment  more tolerant of different views.  I  am  sure  they\r\n\r\nwill  agree that this indeed is happening.  This will not happen\r\n\r\novernight  but  surely the signs are there.   Civil  society  is\r\n\r\nalive and well in Singapore.  The people sector is growing.   It\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  an overnight process but will take time.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  point is we are coming along.  And  as  our  society\r\n\r\nmatures, Singaporeans will have a greater say as to the form and\r\n\r\nshape  it will take.  More and more their views and inputs  will\r\n\r\ncount.  Mr Tay has shared about his involvement in the Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee.   Mr Zulkifli, I think, is part of  the  Feedback\r\n\r\nUnit.  They know from the ground, people who come\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin,  give different and critical views.  They are all looked  at\r\n\r\nand examined to see whether there are any merits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, even in terms of the rules and regulations, we are\r\n\r\nopening up.  A few years ago, PM asked to look at the rules  and\r\n\r\nsee  which can be lifted.  And if you look around you, there are\r\n\r\nmany  areas  in  which  our  rules and regulations  have  become\r\n\r\nlighter, a lighter touch, be it in the area of censorship, be it\r\n\r\nin  the area of entertainment such as jam sessions in jazz bars.\r\n\r\nIt  may  be  a small thing but those people who are involved,  I\r\n\r\nthink  they appreciate it.  It took some time to come along  but\r\n\r\nwe  have.  Or in the area of busking where, of course, it is not\r\n\r\nan  ideal  scheme,  it  can  be  improved,  but  there  are  now\r\n\r\nprovisions in the scheme in place where people can busk  on  the\r\n\r\nstreets  or local government through CDCs  I think Mr  Tay  made\r\n\r\nthat  point   where CDCs now involve more people living  in  HDB\r\n\r\nareas,  private  estates, all having  a  say  as  to  how  local\r\n\r\ngovernment is to be run.  The list really goes on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that there is no climate of fear in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Is there a fear of speaking up?  First  of  all,  I\r\n\r\nwould  say that there are people who speak up critically of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  this House.  Opposition members  speak  up  very\r\n\r\nfreely.   Does  Mr  Chiam fear or Mr Low Thia Khiang  fear?   Or\r\n\r\nindeed does Mr Jeyaretnam fear speaking up?  People speak up  in\r\n\r\nvarious  fora,  out of this House, in seminars, in  conferences,\r\n\r\nletters to the press, you will see people speaking up, sometimes\r\n\r\ncritically  of  the  Government.   Indeed,  at  the  recent  IPS\r\n\r\nconference, views were expressed critical of the Government, and\r\n\r\nthey were widely reported.  Is there fear?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, if I may postulate, maybe people who argue that\r\n\r\nthere  is  such  a pervasive fear want to see a situation  where\r\n\r\nthere  is unbridled criticism of the government and its  leaders\r\n\r\nwhich  happens  in some countries where government  leaders  are\r\n\r\nthen put on the defensive all the time.  But I think that is not\r\n\r\nthe  way to go because then good governance will be eroded.   We\r\n\r\nneed  a strong government, we need a responsible government,  we\r\n\r\nneed a responsive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngovernment.   But it must be a strong government.   Mr  Zulkifli\r\n\r\ntalked about this respect and authority which is in our culture.\r\n\r\nYes, it is there.  And if that respect and authority reposed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is rightly earned, I think  we  should  not  be\r\n\r\nashamed  of  it.   So  that is a key point  -  we  must  have  a\r\n\r\ngovernment that must earn the respect and trust of the people by\r\n\r\ngood  personal  conduct, by bonding with  the  people,  by  good\r\n\r\npolicies  that work.  And again, if Mr Jeyaretnam is  objective,\r\n\r\nhe  must admit that over so many years of PAP rule, since  1959,\r\n\r\nalmost  40  years,  we  have made tremendous  progress  in  many\r\n\r\nfields,  despite  many  difficult  situations  that  had  to  be\r\n\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that this Government takes the position\r\n\r\nthat  if you express a view in public critical of the Government\r\n\r\nor  a  view that is wrong in terms of policies, we will have  to\r\n\r\nreply.  We have to point out where you are wrong.  Otherwise you\r\n\r\nmay  mislead other people and then the wrong thinking  sets  in.\r\n\r\nSo  this  rebuttal is something that Singaporeans  who  want  to\r\n\r\nspeak  up in public will have to learn to take.  It is  part  of\r\n\r\ndebate.    Just  as  you  can  criticise  the  Government,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment must have the prerogative to point out where you  are\r\n\r\nwrong.   As Mr Simon Tay said, the business people gave a  point\r\n\r\nof  view  which  we felt is not correct.  So  we  came  out  and\r\n\r\npointed it out.  So it is not so much the fear of the Government\r\n\r\nor preventive detention laws that put people off.  It could very\r\n\r\nwell be a desire not to be shown up in public which is something\r\n\r\nwhere as a society progresses, I guess, will come along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam's main point relates to our laws and\r\n\r\ndetention without trial.  First of all, I must say that the rule\r\n\r\nof  law prevails in Singapore.  Our detentions without trial are\r\n\r\nnot  a  negation of the rule of law.  They reinforce and support\r\n\r\nlaw  and order in Singapore.  It is absurd to say that our  laws\r\n\r\nand  detention  without  trial  put  fear  in  the  preponderant\r\n\r\nmajority of law-abiding Singaporeans, as has been pointed out by\r\n\r\nthe  other  speakers.   On  the  contrary,  they  put  fear   in\r\n\r\ncriminals, drug addicts, drug traffickers, terrorists and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuch  like,  deterring them from their destructive conduct.   So\r\n\r\nour  tough laws, including laws on detention without trial,  are\r\n\r\none  reason  why Singapore is one of the safest  cities  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  with a relatively low incidence of drug abuse  or  crime.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  if  we do what Mr Jeyaretnam argues for  and  abolish\r\n\r\nthese  laws, then Singaporeans would indeed live in great  fear.\r\n\r\nThat we must not allow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not fully repeat the arguments for retaining our\r\n\r\nlaws   on  detention  without  trial.   These  have  been  fully\r\n\r\nventilated.  Suffice it for me to say that these laws have  been\r\n\r\nin our books for a long time and they are serving their purposes\r\n\r\nwell.   The  CLTPA  and  Misuse of Drugs  Act  (MDA)  are  still\r\n\r\nrelevant   in  countering  secret  society  elements  and   drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers.   As  a result, our streets are  free  from  secret\r\n\r\nsociety  elements.   They are there, but we have  to  keep  them\r\n\r\ndown.   Our  drug  situation is under control.  Other  countries\r\n\r\nwithout  such  laws  face problems, especially  in  apprehending\r\n\r\nsyndicate  heads  or  masterminds.  So  please  do  not  let  Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  lull us into complacency.  As for  the  ISA,  it  is\r\n\r\nstill  relevant in countering security threats, such  as  racial\r\n\r\nand  religious extremism, international terrorism, espionage and\r\n\r\nsubversion.   Because of our laws, the above problems  have  not\r\n\r\ncome  upon us.  But does it therefore mean that we let our guard\r\n\r\ndown?   It cannot be so, because if we do, we will pay  a  heavy\r\n\r\nprice.   One example will be foreign triads and crime syndicates\r\n\r\nmay  be  emboldened to penetrate and operate here.  Do  we  want\r\n\r\nthat?  Surely, no.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam quite naively asked for evidence of terrorism\r\n\r\nand  other such like activities.  Surely these people who engage\r\n\r\nin such activities will not readily show their face.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> They are in mask.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> So let us not be lulled into\r\n\r\ncomplacency by Mr Jeyaretnam's seductive and ill-conceived call.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Tay has mentioned, other countries too have the equivalent\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nISA  and they have remained in their arsenal.  Why?  Because the\r\n\r\nsafeguarding of national security is paramount in all societies.\r\n\r\nThis  is  all the more so in a small, relatively new multiracial\r\n\r\ncountry like Singapore.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam should go and see\r\n\r\nthe National Education Exhibition, if he has not, to see how  we\r\n\r\nhave  come  to where we are today and how things can  really  go\r\n\r\nawry if we let our guard down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is important is that these laws should not be abused\r\n\r\nor  misused and that there are adequate safeguards.  And indeed,\r\n\r\nthe Government will be accountable to the people of Singapore if\r\n\r\nwe  abuse  and misuse these laws.  So, again, here, we must  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  Singaporeans are so unthinking, that they  are  not\r\n\r\ndiscerning  enough  if the Government misuses  or  abuses  these\r\n\r\npreventive detention laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me assure this House that these laws are not laws\r\n\r\nto  bypass the criminal law processes.  Mr Jeyaretnam says, \"Oh,\r\n\r\nthere  are  other  laws  that  can be  used.\".   But  preventive\r\n\r\ndetention laws are used in situations where reprisals may be the\r\n\r\norder  of  the  day  if you go through the normal  criminal  law\r\n\r\nprocess  because we are dealing with terrorists, we are  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  drug  syndicates,  we  are  dealing  with  secret  society\r\n\r\nelements.   So we must have this regime that takes care  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now address this point about judicial review. I\r\n\r\nthink  Mr  Zulkifli  and Mr Simon Tay have  asked  whether  this\r\n\r\nprocess  could  be examined.  As they are aware,  following  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Appeal  decision in 1989, an amendment  was  made  to\r\n\r\nrestore  the status quo ante, which is a subjective test,  which\r\n\r\nwas a position long established by case law, and which reflected\r\n\r\nGovernment's position all along.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Is that right?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The question of judicial review\r\n\r\nwas   thoroughly  debated  on  that  occasion.   In  moving  the\r\n\r\namendment,  the Minister for Law gave reasons why  there  should\r\n\r\nnot be judicial review of the substantive grounds of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndetention  under  the  ISA.   The general  point  is  that,  for\r\n\r\nnational security, the Executive must have the final say.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must retain the right to decide what is and what is\r\n\r\nnot   a  security  threat.   Also,  as  I  mentioned  just  now,\r\n\r\npreventive  detention is by its nature a precautionary  measure.\r\n\r\nTherefore, what is involved are covert operations, which have to\r\n\r\nbe  covert  to  get evidence as to some of these threats.   Such\r\n\r\noperations  and sources will be compromised if a  court  hearing\r\n\r\nwere  to  be conducted.  Again, let me emphasise what is  really\r\n\r\nimportant is the integrity of the people who run the system, who\r\n\r\nare  of  course  accountable to the people, and the  safeguards.\r\n\r\nRecently, a new safeguard in the Elected President's veto powers\r\n\r\nwas added.  So it shows that we are improving the system all the\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli made this point about whether we should have a\r\n\r\ntribunal of three judges rather than the present position  where\r\n\r\nthere  is an advisory board.  The present position is preferable\r\n\r\nbecause  the board comprises a sitting Supreme Court  judge  and\r\n\r\ntwo  prominent  citizens appointed by the President.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  we are involving the people.  So I think there is better\r\n\r\naccountability and transparency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have taken some time. But I\r\n\r\nthink today's motion surely cannot stand.  It is drafted in such\r\n\r\nwide  terms.   It makes such sweeping statements.  It  does  not\r\n\r\ntake into account the progress that has taken place in Singapore\r\n\r\nthe  fact that there is more consultation between the Government\r\n\r\nand  people,  the  fact that some of the  rules  which  are  not\r\n\r\nneedful  have already been abolished, the fact that there  is  a\r\n\r\nlighter  touch  to Government.  Really, we must not  leave  this\r\n\r\nChamber  with  the  picture  that  Mr  Jeyaretnam  paints,  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are gripped by fear, unthinking, robotic.  Is  that\r\n\r\nthe  real  situation, Singaporeans who are like that,  who  have\r\n\r\nmade Singapore what it is today?  The answer must surely be no.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister of State whether he\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  prepared to tell this House how many political detainees  we\r\n\r\nhave for the last three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

Instead  of\r\n\r\nthat, the Minister of State says things which are repeated again\r\n\r\nand  again,  that  the  PAP has taken good  care  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is what it is today because of the past,  we  do  not\r\n\r\nneed  to  change  anything.  We have heard  all  this.   But  no\r\n\r\nattempt  is  made to answer the points.  But as  I  said  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech,  I will let Mr Lee Kuan Yew make the answer to  what  we\r\n\r\nhave heard from the junior Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Kuan Yew was speaking in April 1955 when there was a\r\n\r\nreal threat, there were the communists fighting in the jungle in\r\n\r\nMalaysia, there was threat of subversion in Singapore and he was\r\n\r\nopposing  the  extension of the Emergency Regulations  after  Mr\r\n\r\nMarshall's government took over.  They wanted to extend  it  for\r\n\r\nthree months, promising to study and review it and this is  what\r\n\r\nthe  great  architect of our society today said in 1955,  and  I\r\n\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But we either believe in democracy or we do not. If we\r\n\r\ndo, then we must say categorically without qualification that no\r\n\r\nrestraint from any democratic process other than by the ordinary\r\n\r\nlaw of the land should be allowed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, at the time, as I said, when there was a real threat,  and\r\n\r\nthat  was  Mr  Lee Kuan Yew, the great champion  of  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech, of liberty, of freedom of association, holding forth  in\r\n\r\nthis  House which was then an Assembly.  And the same man, great\r\n\r\nchampion of freedom, speaking in September 1955 when Mr Marshall\r\n\r\nwas  introducing the Public Peace and Security Ordinance (PPSO),\r\n\r\nMr  Marshall  was  introducing into that  law  a  proper  appeal\r\n\r\ntribunal   with  power  to  release  anyone  detained   by   the\r\n\r\ngovernment,  not  an  advisory  board  but  giving  this  appeal\r\n\r\ntribunal  full  powers  to  order  release  if  they  were   not\r\n\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThere  you have an adequate safeguard.  But Mr Lee did not  want\r\n\r\nany  detention even in September 1955 when the threat was  still\r\n\r\nthere and this is what he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`What he [referring to the Chief Minister] is seeking to do\r\n\r\nin  the  name of democracy is to curtail a fundamental  liberty,\r\n\r\nand  the  most fundamental of them all, freedom from arrest  and\r\n\r\npunishment, without having violated a specific provision of  the\r\n\r\nlaw and being convicted for it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo,  I  would like the Minister of State to think about what  Mr\r\n\r\nLee  was saying.  This is not me speaking today.  It is Mr  Lee,\r\n\r\nhis  own leader, speaking in 1955.  And I am surprised that this\r\n\r\ngreat  architect  of  our  society is not  in  this  House  this\r\n\r\nafternoon to answer my motion.  Why is he not here?  After  all,\r\n\r\nhe  was  the man who is responsible for the continuation of  the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security  Act.   He  was the  man  who  repealed  this\r\n\r\nadequate  safeguard that Mr Marshall had introduced.  Should  he\r\n\r\nnot  be here to explain why?  What was wrong in 1955, when there\r\n\r\nwas a real threat, why is it now absolutely necessary when there\r\n\r\nis no threat?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do sympathise, if I may say, with the Minister of State,\r\n\r\nbecause  he was not responsible for these laws.  I am  sorry,  I\r\n\r\nhope he does not feel offended, he does not have the depth to be\r\n\r\nable to examine these issues and to answer the criticisms of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also tell him what his leader in 1955 said, when Mr\r\n\r\nMarshall told him, \"You are always bringing up the same  thing\",\r\n\r\nMr  Lee  Kuan Yew's answer was, \"I shall go on repeating  it  ad\r\n\r\nnauseam until you change the law.\"  So that is my answer to  the\r\n\r\njunior Minister and to others when they accuse me of bringing up\r\n\r\nold  issues.  If something is wrong and remains a wrong, someone\r\n\r\nwho feels that it should be changed should go on bringing it  up\r\n\r\nuntil it is changed.  So I intend to do that and this is not the\r\n\r\nlast time that this House will hear on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the architect, why is the Prime Minister not\r\n\r\nhere to reply to this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> He has better things to do!\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> He wants a gracious society. How can we\r\n\r\nhave  a  gracious society unless we have a civil society  first?\r\n\r\nAnd  a civil society is a society of people, men and women,  who\r\n\r\nare  conscious of their rights and who are not afraid  to  speak\r\n\r\nup,  who know that the law protects them, and they can speak  up\r\n\r\nand  participate  in  the  decision making.   That  is  a  civil\r\n\r\nsociety.  You must have that first before you can talk  about  a\r\n\r\ngracious society.  So why is the Prime Minister not here?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also disappointed that the Minister for Law is not\r\n\r\nhere.   I  would have asked him whether he had always  held  the\r\n\r\nview  that  detention without trial did not offend the  Rule  of\r\n\r\nLaw.  Members would have been surprised at his answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: do we, in present day Singapore, need to\r\n\r\narm  ourselves  with powers to throw people into prison  without\r\n\r\nfirst  bringing  them up before a court of law,  laying  charges\r\n\r\nagainst  them  and the court hearing the charges and  convicting\r\n\r\nthem  and then sending them to prison?  That is the Rule of Law,\r\n\r\nI am afraid, not anything else.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised to hear from the Minister of State that\r\n\r\ndetentions  without trial do not negate the Rule of  Law.   What\r\n\r\ndoes  he  understand by the rule of law?  The Rule  of  Law,  as\r\n\r\nexplained  by the Privy Council in the Ong Ah Chuan's  case,  is\r\n\r\nnot  just  the  written laws but incorporates into  it  what  is\r\n\r\ncalled natural justice or what the Americans would call the  due\r\n\r\nprocess  of law, ie, no one may be punished in any way, deprived\r\n\r\nof his life or liberty until he has been found guilty by a court\r\n\r\nof   law  and  ordered  to  suffer  the  punishment.   Our   own\r\n\r\nConstitution says that no  man may be deprived of  his  life  or\r\n\r\nliberty,  save  in accordance with the law.  And  what  does  it\r\n\r\nmean?   When  Parliament passes any law, you can  just  pick  up\r\n\r\npeople  and  put them in prison?  If that is the interpretation,\r\n\r\nthen the Constitution becomes a laughing stock.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I come to deal with the reply from the Minister of\r\n\r\nState,  let  me  deal with the speeches of  the  others.   As  I\r\n\r\nunderstood the speakers, the general\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrend  appears to be that we do not really have to do away  with\r\n\r\nthe ISA, but we can perhaps be a bit more tolerant.  We must get\r\n\r\nthe message across to the people that they have nothing to fear.\r\n\r\nBut  what good does it do to tell people that they have  nothing\r\n\r\nto  fear when you retain in the statute books the power to throw\r\n\r\nthem  into  prison?   No amount of saying, \"you  don't  have  to\r\n\r\nworry,  my  chap, we won't throw you into prison,\" is  going  to\r\n\r\nconvince  them.   The only way you can convince them  that  they\r\n\r\nhave nothing to fear is to remove the power so that they can see\r\n\r\nit.   That the Government no longer has the power to detain them\r\n\r\nwithout first bringing them before the court.  That is the  only\r\n\r\nanswer, nothing else.  Nothing short of it will help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers also made the point that there is a\r\n\r\nperception.  Of course, it is a perception.  And they  say  that\r\n\r\npeople  perhaps fear when they need not fear.  That is true.   I\r\n\r\nhave told the people a number of times that there is nothing  to\r\n\r\nbe  afraid of.  But do they take me seriously?  When I tell them\r\n\r\nthere  is  nothing to be afraid of, they say, \"Can you guarantee\r\n\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this perception. So, what does the Government do\r\n\r\nabout  it?  Keep telling them there is nothing to fear,  nothing\r\n\r\nto  worry, or does the Government take active steps to eliminate\r\n\r\nthat  fear?  That is what I am asking the Government to  do,  to\r\n\r\ntake  active  steps  to eliminate that fear, however  irrational\r\n\r\nthat  fear  may be, however unfounded.  But the fear exists.   I\r\n\r\nthink  it has been acknowledged by the other speakers that there\r\n\r\nis  that  fear.  So the Government has to take active  steps  to\r\n\r\nremove  that fear.  No amount of \"there is nothing to  fear,  my\r\n\r\ngood  people, you speak up,\" will convince them.   Many  a  taxi\r\n\r\ndriver  when  they see me say, \"In Singapore, we  can't  speak.\"\r\n\r\nAnd  I  said, \"Why not?\"  They say, \"We might lose our  licence.\r\n\r\nWe  might  be  put into prison.\"  You might say that  these  are\r\n\r\nunfounded fears.  But how do we reassure them?  And the only way\r\n\r\nyou can reassure them is to remove that power in your grasp.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the speakers also seem to say that we do need\r\n\r\nemergency  powers  in times of emergency.  I  have  said  in  my\r\n\r\nspeech   that  the  Constitution  does  provide  for  times   of\r\n\r\nemergency.   They  are Articles 149 to 151 of  the  Constitution\r\n\r\nwhich say that when there is a real threat to the country,  when\r\n\r\nthere  is a danger of any subversion and Parliament is satisfied\r\n\r\nof  this  danger and threat to the country, then Parliament  may\r\n\r\npass  laws curtailing the freedom of the people and, as I  said,\r\n\r\nrequiring  that that be reviewed and should no longer remain  on\r\n\r\nthe  statute books once the emergency is over.  So we  have  got\r\n\r\nit.   It  is  not as though we do not have the power  to  invoke\r\n\r\nthese  powers  of  detention  without  trial  if  there  is   an\r\n\r\nemergency,  if there is a threat.  But we do not need  it  as  a\r\n\r\npermanent  feature in our statute books.  I would like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhich  country  in  the world has this as a  permanent  feature.\r\n\r\nThey,  of  course,  retain the right in times  of  emergency  to\r\n\r\ninvoke  these  powers.  I think the Indian Parliament  has  this\r\n\r\nprovision.   But which country has it as a permanent feature  in\r\n\r\nthe ordinary laws of the land?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the Minister of State a number of questions. He\r\n\r\nthinks  I  am being naive in asking the questions.   Of  course,\r\n\r\nevery  question that I ask is naive because the Government  does\r\n\r\nnot  really want to answer those questions.  So the easiest  way\r\n\r\nis to say, \"It is a naive question, a silly question.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised that the Minister of State should say that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  climate  of fear.  Even  the  two  Nominated  MPs\r\n\r\nmentioned about this fear.  But they did not think it was as bad\r\n\r\nas I made it out to be.  But have they encountered the fear as I\r\n\r\nhave encountered it in people?  I gave you the examples where  I\r\n\r\nencountered this fear in our people.  Have they encountered  the\r\n\r\nfear  as  I  have encountered it?  Have they gone  round  asking\r\n\r\npeople  to  stand for elections to Parliament?  Have  they  gone\r\n\r\nround  asking  them  to  donate any  monies  to  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties?  Have they gone round asking the printers to print  for\r\n\r\nthe  opposition parties?   Then they will know whether there  is\r\n\r\nthis fear or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State says that we cannot have unbridled\r\n\r\ncriticisms.  I can again, for his reading, recommend him to what\r\n\r\nhis  great leader said in the Malaysian Parliament in  1964.   I\r\n\r\nhope  that  every PAP Member of Parliament has  been  given  all\r\n\r\nthese  speeches of the leader made when he was in the opposition\r\n\r\nfrom  1954 to 1959.  It should be compulsory reading,  and  then\r\n\r\nthey  could perhaps ask the leader why is it not right now  when\r\n\r\nhe  said it was right in 1954 to have these freedoms.  I hope it\r\n\r\nis also compulsory reading for PAP MPs of Mr Francis Seow's book\r\n\r\n\"To  Catch  a Tartar\".  There, they will see an account  of  how\r\n\r\nthey  deal with opposition politicians or people aspiring to  be\r\n\r\nopposition politicians once they are taken in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State refers to the amendment that was made\r\n\r\nafter  the  Court of  Appeal decision in 1989.  With respect  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister,  I think he has got it all wrong.   The  case  of\r\n\r\nLiversidge and Anderson that Mr Simon Tay mentioned was  a  case\r\n\r\nwhen  England  was facing across the Channel the German  forces.\r\n\r\nThere  was a real danger there, and Lord Atkin stood out against\r\n\r\nall  the  other judges and said, that even in such a  state,  it\r\n\r\nwould be wholly wrong to deprive a man of his liberty unless  he\r\n\r\nhad  been found guilty by a court of law.  But the other  judges\r\n\r\nthought that in time of such grave danger, the Executive  should\r\n\r\nbe  the  judges.   That  was 1942, a time  of  great  danger  to\r\n\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years later, the House of Lords said, Lord Atkin's\r\n\r\nclassic  statement  was  the  right  principle  in  law.   Every\r\n\r\nimprisonment  is  prima facie unlawful unless it  is  justified.\r\n\r\nThat  was the law in many other countries, but we continued with\r\n\r\nthe law of Liversidge and Anderson, when all the other countries\r\n\r\nsaid that that was wrong.  But in 1989 the Court of  Appeal felt\r\n\r\nconstrained because of all the authorities that were put  before\r\n\r\nit,  authorities from other Commonwealth countries.   They  felt\r\n\r\nconstrained to change, and said, \"The time has come now  for  us\r\n\r\nto change.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncourts should have the right to look into the merits.\"  That was\r\n\r\nwhat  led  to  the  amendment of the  law,  amendments  made  by\r\n\r\nParliament excluding any review of the merits by a court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two other points. The Minister of State says,\r\n\r\ntongue in cheek, that the Government must be accountable to  the\r\n\r\npeople.   That  is the real test.  Government can only  be  made\r\n\r\naccountable to the people, if the people are given an unfettered\r\n\r\nright  to  question the Government and to demand an answer.   In\r\n\r\nother  countries, they have the Freedom of Information Act.   We\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  it  in  Singapore.  It  is  only  then  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  be made accountable.  It is no  good  repeating\r\n\r\nover  and  over again that we are accountable.  People must  see\r\n\r\nthe right in themselves to make the Government accountable, that\r\n\r\nthey can demand answers and explanations, and the Government has\r\n\r\nto  reply  to those criticisms.  My party has asked a number  of\r\n\r\nquestions to which we never get a reply.  Is that accountability\r\n\r\nof the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Minister says the advisory boards that we have\r\n\r\nat  the  moment, which Mr David Marshall abolished and  replaced\r\n\r\nwith  a  proper Appeal Court, are adequate.  How could they  be?\r\n\r\nThey  do not have any power except to make recommendations which\r\n\r\nthe Government may accept or may not accept.  The decision still\r\n\r\nlies with the Government.  So what good is it having an advisory\r\n\r\nboard  if  it  has  no teeth?   I am saying to this  Government,\r\n\r\nquite seriously, and speaking as someone who has the welfare  of\r\n\r\nthis  country at heart, who feels for our citizens, that  it  is\r\n\r\ntime that the Government set them free, free from this fear  and\r\n\r\nthe only way you can do that is to show them that they no longer\r\n\r\nhave any fear of being detained except under due process of law.\r\n\r\nWhether  they speak against the Government or whether they  join\r\n\r\nopposition parties or help opposition parties, they need have no\r\n\r\nfear whatsoever.  The Government cannot detain them because they\r\n\r\nare going to do away with that power.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way the Government can remove the fear is to\r\n\r\nabolish  the  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.   Because\r\n\r\nthat  is also used to strike fear into people's hearts.  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  about  persons  picked  up  by  the  police  who  are\r\n\r\nreminded,   \"We  have the power, you know, to detain  you  under\r\n\r\nsection  30 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.   So\r\n\r\nwhat  are  you going to do?\"  So I hope that something  will  be\r\n\r\ndone  to  assure  the  people, not just lip  service,  but  some\r\n\r\nconcrete steps taken to show the people that they need not  live\r\n\r\nunder  fear any longer, but they can breathe the air more freely\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  live as men and women of dignity, holding  their\r\n\r\nheads high and proud of themselves as a people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly negatived.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Assoc.

Whether they  will  face  prolonged\r\n\r\nunemployment  for  up  to  a year or more,  depends  on  several\r\n\r\nfactors.  Firstly, are there still jobs for these workers?  Yes,\r\n\r\nthere  are  still many jobs, especially in the services  sector,\r\n\r\nwhich can be done by older and unskilled workers.  Secondly, can\r\n\r\nthis group of workers make the necessary adjustments in terms of\r\n\r\nnature  of work and wages in order to stay employed?   They  may\r\n\r\nhave to accept lower wages, or work which is different from what\r\n\r\nthey  have been used to during this economic slowdown.  Thirdly,\r\n\r\nhow  quickly can they acquire some useful skills which will help\r\n\r\nthem  to  find  alternative jobs?  This is  a  critical  factor.\r\n\r\nApart  from  the  economic  slowdown,  we  are  also  undergoing\r\n\r\nrestructuring  towards higher technology and higher  value-added\r\n\r\nindustries.   New  jobs being created will need  higher  skills.\r\n\r\nOlder  workers, who are unskilled or lower-skilled, must upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves if they want to take on these new jobs.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem faced by older and unskilled workers will\r\n\r\nresult  in  structural  unemployment.

This will complement  the\r\n\r\nSkills Development Fund's allocation of $50 million for the SRP.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Minister for Finance has allocated $20\r\n\r\nmillion  to  establish a Skills Development Centre.   The  total\r\n\r\nbudget for the SRP is hence $120 million and is expected to meet\r\n\r\nthe  skills  upgrading  needs  for up  to  40,000  lower-skilled\r\n\r\nworkers over the next 2 years. We will monitor closely the level\r\n\r\nof  usage  of  the SRP and ensure that funds are  sufficient  to\r\n\r\nprovide the training places needed and the scope of training  to\r\n\r\nenhance employability for older workers.

The  great\r\n\r\nmajority   of   students  are   hardworking,  well-behaved   and\r\n\r\nresponsible.    Serious  cases  of  breach  of  discipline   are\r\n\r\ninfrequent occurrences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1995, MOE has implemented the Behaviour Tracking and\r\n\r\nAnalysis  (BETA)  system in schools.  The  system  represents  a\r\n\r\nmethodical way of collecting data on the state of discipline  in\r\n\r\nschools.  The implementation of the BETA system has allowed  MOE\r\n\r\nto  collect  data  on  disciplinary cases very  quickly  and  to\r\n\r\nrespond to changing trends in disciplinary problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The records made by schools using the BETA system showed no\r\n\r\nsignificant  statistical change in the  offence  rates  (offence\r\n\r\nrates refer to the number of offences per 1000 pupils) from 1995\r\n\r\nto  1997.   There is, however, a significantly higher proportion\r\n\r\nof  offences  in  the  secondary schools  than  in  the  primary\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For primary schools, less serious offences such as not\r\n\r\ndoing  assignments  and  disruptive  behaviour  and  attendance-related offences constitute 84% of the total number of offences.\r\n\r\nOffences such as theft/damage to property, assault and fighting,\r\n\r\nconstitute the bulk of the more serious offences (16%).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secondary schools, top offences were attendance-related (74%), namely late-coming and truancy. Misconduct\r\n\r\noffences dropped by 1% to 3% each year over the 3-year period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the stabilising of the offence rate can be\r\n\r\nattributed  to the concerted and co-ordinated efforts  taken  by\r\n\r\nschools  and  agencies  such  as the  Police,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development,  the juvenile court,  Voluntary  Welfare\r\n\r\nOrganisations and self-help groups in managing discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are continuing in their efforts to improve the\r\n\r\nstate  of discipline.  MOE is also alert to the possible changes\r\n\r\nin  trends in discipline problems and juvenile delinquencies and\r\n\r\nare taking measures to address potential problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An area of concern is the increase in the number of cases\r\n\r\nof  substance abuse from 33 cases in 1995 to 272 cases in  1997.\r\n\r\nMOE  and MHA are working very closely together to try to contain\r\n\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of concern is the growing offence rate\r\n\r\namongst  female  pupils  in the secondary  schools.  The  female\r\n\r\noffence  rates, though lower than the male offence  rates,  have\r\n\r\nincreased  by  6% to 9% per year compared to the rate  for  boys\r\n\r\nwhich has remained fairly constant.  A committee chaired by  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister of State for Education, Dr Aline Wong, was  set\r\n\r\nup  in May this year to look into the discipline situation among\r\n\r\ngirls  in schools.

The extent to which schools care  for  the  pupils\r\n\r\nunder their charge is the extent to which schools can discipline\r\n\r\nits  pupils.   In  general, schools have adopted a  whole-person\r\n\r\napproach  to  discipline.  Thus, in the  discipline  of  pupils,\r\n\r\nschools are mindful of the needs of the pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While schools do mete out consequences for misbehaviour,\r\n\r\ncounselling is often used together with these measures  to  help\r\n\r\nthe   child  correct  his  behaviour.   Schools  also  work   in\r\n\r\npartnership with parents in disciplining their children so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  provide  the necessary home support  to  sustain  the\r\n\r\nchanges in behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While principals are allowed to administer corporal\r\n\r\npunishment on male pupils, many schools restrict its use only to\r\n\r\nvery serious offences such as assaults, extortion and vandalism.\r\n\r\nSchools  have to abide by the guidelines on corporal  punishment\r\n\r\nprovided by MOE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PRIMARY SCHOOL SYSTEM</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Gerard Ee</b> asked the Minister for Education what is being\r\n\r\ndone  to  ensure that all children leaving the school system  at\r\n\r\nthe primary level can read and write in basic English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English is a core subject in the curriculum.
