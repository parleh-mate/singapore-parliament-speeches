It is my hope, Mr Speaker, that a  decision\r\n\r\nwill be quickly arrived at by this House. I therefore\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on item 2 of the Order Paper\r\n\r\nfor this day shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.00 p.m. today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, we are\r\n\r\nsummoned to an emergency sitting of this Assembly  to\r\n\r\nenact yet another scene of the tragedy of destruction\r\n\r\nof   respect  and  goodwill  for  democracy  and  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  process. This Assembly has now  become  a\r\n\r\npublic   plaything  of  the  P.A.P.  Even  the   time\r\n\r\nallocated  for  consideration  of  vital  matters  of\r\n\r\npublic  importance, as alleged by the Leader  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse, is  now to be limited to meet the convenience\r\n\r\nof the social activities of our Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is need for an emergency session of this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  why limit it to five hours? Is it  because\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister has a party at 6.30 this evening?\r\n\r\nIs it because he has decided to leave late tonight on\r\n\r\nanother  of  his  many trips, and  cannot  trust  his\r\n\r\ncolleagues to carry on without him? Is this  Assembly\r\n\r\nthen  the  Prime Minister's toy, like a yo-yo  to  be\r\n\r\ntwisted on his finger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  and when he pleases? Was it not anticipated  last\r\n\r\nweek  by the Leader of the House that there would  be\r\n\r\npublished  a  Referendum Report by the Superintendent\r\n\r\nof  the  Referendum? Why could he not have used  some\r\n\r\nintelligent anticipation and given notice to suit the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister's   convenience   and   his   social\r\n\r\nactivities  for  the holding of this special  sitting\r\n\r\nlast Monday, Sir? We could then have had a full day's\r\n\r\nhearing  at  least,  or  yesterday  when  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  would have been there to guide his  cohorts\r\n\r\nin  the  methods of dishonesty now so  eminently  and\r\n\r\npublicly  known as the principal instrument of  P.A.P\r\n\r\npolicy.  Why was this notice not given last week  for\r\n\r\nthe  convening of this Assembly earlier if we had  to\r\n\r\nsuit   the  Prime  Minister's  convenience?  Was   it\r\n\r\nbecause,  Mr  Speaker,  had  the  results   of   the\r\n\r\nreferendum been other than they are, there would have\r\n\r\nbeen  no  sitting of this Assembly? That they  waited\r\n\r\nto  make quite sure that there would be no question\r\n\r\nabout  the  blank  votes and they could  publish  the\r\n\r\nblank  votes before they could have the  courage  to\r\n\r\ngive  notice  of the convening of this Assembly?  The\r\n\r\nnotice  of  sitting was given last Monday  after  the\r\n\r\nreferendum results were known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Leader of the House must have been fully conscious that there must be a sitting of this Assembly whatever the results of the referendum. Why did he not give his notice earlier?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion standing in the Prime Minister's name is\r\n\r\na  motion of shameless dishonesty as well as one,  in\r\n\r\nmy  submission, that is illegal.

Though the Government can pass a Bill  to\r\n\r\nmake a man into a woman, it cannot say the Opposition\r\n\r\nsays  that a man is a woman when the Opposition votes\r\n\r\nagainst it. But above all, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my\r\n\r\nintention to draw the attention of the Government  to\r\n\r\nthe fact that it has the opportunity to be honest and\r\n\r\nyet  have  its cake, have what it wants. And whatever\r\n\r\nits  tradition of dishonesty, whatever its  corkscrew\r\n\r\nincapacity to go straight, here is one chance  to  be\r\n\r\nhonest,  here  is  one chance to act constitutionally\r\n\r\nlike  other civilised human beings, and here  is  one\r\n\r\nchance  where, without costing them anything, we  can\r\n\r\nso   gracefully   avoid   utilising   the   dishonest\r\n\r\nprovisions which they prepared.

We  were  informed  late  Monday\r\n\r\nafternoon  that there was going to be  a  sitting  on\r\n\r\nWednesday  to discuss a matter of very urgent  public\r\n\r\nimportance. And this is what it is about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if this matter, which is to be debated later,\r\n\r\nis of such urgent public importance as the Government\r\n\r\nhas  deemed it, then it should not limit the time  of\r\n\r\nthe  House  to its discussion. How could a matter  of\r\n\r\nurgent public importance be debated and thrashed  out\r\n\r\nfully within as short a time as 4\u00bd hours?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if this \"guillotine\" motion is\r\n\r\nbeing  forced  through by Government's  majority,  it\r\n\r\nwould  convey  the  impression  to  the  public  that\r\n\r\ntoday's  Assembly  sitting has  been  called  not  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss a matter of urgent public importance  but  to\r\n\r\nput  forward  nothing  but just  plain,  pure  P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we realise that\r\n\r\nopposing this guillotine motion will not get us  very\r\n\r\nfar  because  the Government, by virtue of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat it has a majority in this House, is in\r\n\r\nposition  to  carry  it through.

However, the Member for Anson  in  his\r\n\r\nusual  manner  has launched into a tirade  which  has\r\n\r\nbrought in my social engagements and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  activities, and I feel that in fairness,  I\r\n\r\nshould say: yes, the matter was anticipated and it\r\n\r\nwas duly discussed by us in Cabinet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, the Leader of the House consulted\r\n\r\nthe  officials of the Assembly about the  relevant\r\n\r\nprovisions  and  we did this as a  calculated  and\r\n\r\ndeliberate move, and we believe it is the  correct\r\n\r\nmove.  The campaign was going on right to its  end\r\n\r\non Saturday, and we did not want to throw anything\r\n\r\ninto  the scales that would have just been another\r\n\r\nstraw  which  might have disturbed the  course  of\r\n\r\nevents.  That being so, we had to wait  until  the\r\n\r\nvotes had been registered. Saturday was a holiday;\r\n\r\nSunday  was a holiday; and we required  one  clear\r\n\r\nday's  notice. Notice had either to  be  given  on\r\n\r\nFriday,   which   would  have  been   before   the\r\n\r\nreferendum  results,  or  immediately  after   the\r\n\r\nreferendum results, which was on Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in so calculating, I anticipated\r\n\r\nthat  it  would interfere with certain engagements\r\n\r\nto   which  I  have  committed  myself,  such   as\r\n\r\nattending  a conference of Commonwealth  socialist\r\n\r\nleaders in London, many of whom will perhaps  have\r\n\r\nfond  memories of the Member for Anson. I  do  not\r\n\r\nintend to break this engagement as I think  it  is\r\n\r\nuseful  to  the country. The people  should  know\r\n\r\nthat the Communist line of a reactionary, corrupt,\r\n\r\neffete  and decadent Government should be debunked\r\n\r\nand utterly exploded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided on the time - a full five hours\r\n\r\nwithout  a  tea-break. It was carefully calculated\r\n\r\nto  give  a full day's sitting. One p.m. to  6.00\r\n\r\np.m. is equivalent to 2.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. minus\r\n\r\nhalf  an hour tea-break. It is as simple as  that\r\n\r\narithmetically. Having decided that it would be at 6.00 p.m. and discovering that I had some time  to\r\n\r\nspare,  I  decided this evening to thank  publicly\r\n\r\nthe many social and civic organisations which took\r\n\r\na stand and helped to break the Communist myth of\r\n\r\nthe  masses  supporting whatever balderdash,  the\r\n\r\ntirades   of  abuse  that  they  heaped  on   this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  I make no apologies for this either  to\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House or to the public.

The P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nof which I am proud to have been a member all this\r\n\r\ntime,  does not change its colours and its habits.\r\n\r\nWe  move in a deliberate and calculated manner  in\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the people, regardless of  abuse\r\n\r\nand   regardless  of  tirades.

The   obvious\r\n\r\nobjective  for  any socialist party,  whether  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  or non-Communist variety, is the solidarity\r\n\r\nof  the nation through merger, and the achievement  of\r\n\r\nfreedom.  The  right thing was co-operation  with  all\r\n\r\npatriotic  nationalist groups,  however  bourgeois  or\r\n\r\nwavering social democrats they may be.

What we are saying\r\n\r\nis  that  we  in this Assembly have the  right  to\r\n\r\ndecide,  and we are deciding that we shall abstain\r\n\r\nand allow the Opposition to decide. Whether it  is\r\n\r\nconstitutional  or  unconstitutional  to   abstain\r\n\r\ndepends upon the rules of this Assembly.

I would like to\r\n\r\ntake  the  Member  for Anson through  the  simple\r\n\r\nmental  process - I mean he could  picture.  He  is\r\n\r\nvery   good   at  vivid  pictures - lurid,   sombre,\r\n\r\nhorrifying  colours in his pictures. But  this  is\r\n\r\nquite  simple. According to section 29 (1) of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance - \"the   decision   of   the   Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly    on    the    matter    referred    for\r\n\r\nreferendum\" - the matter referred for the referendum\r\n\r\nwas  the  motion  that was moved  in  this  House.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the blank votes have to be decided now,\r\n\r\nin  accordance  with section 29. In  other  words,\r\n\r\nthis  whole  Assembly will vote.  I  will  give  a\r\n\r\nsimple  illustration. Had there been more B  votes\r\n\r\nthan A votes, then it would have been open-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> We never had an honest\r\n\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Well, he is very fortunate,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  having  us  campaign   so\r\n\r\nvigorously for A.

However, that\r\n\r\ndid  not take place and the decisive vote was  for\r\n\r\nA.  In this particular case, it does not matter in\r\n\r\nthe end result whether the blank votes will go  to\r\n\r\nA,  B or C. We therefore deem it our pleasure  and\r\n\r\nprivilege   that,  on  deciding  this   particular\r\n\r\nquestion when the votes are counted and a division\r\n\r\nis  called  for,  we  should vote  for  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper - I  understand the Leader of the  House  has\r\n\r\nsettled  this  with Members of the Opposition  who\r\n\r\nagreed un the White Paper - but we shall abstain and\r\n\r\ngive  the privilege of deciding on the blank votes\r\n\r\nto  those  who  called for it.  There  is  nothing\r\n\r\nunconstitutional.  There is propriety  within  the\r\n\r\nfour corners of the law. It is absolutely pristine\r\n\r\nin  its purity as a constitutional nicety.

I  have looked at  the  matter  very\r\n\r\ncarefully  and  it seems to me that  there  is  an\r\n\r\nargument  as  to  what  is the  interpretation  of\r\n\r\nsection 29. The motion itself requests this  House\r\n\r\nto  make  certain  decisions  in  accordance  with\r\n\r\nsection  29 and, therefore, it is not  for  me  to\r\n\r\ndecide  whether the resolutions sought in (1)  and\r\n\r\n(2)  or  both would be in accordance with  section\r\n\r\n29. In other words, it is not for me to decide  as\r\n\r\nto  what  interpretation this Assembly chooses  to\r\n\r\nput  on section 29. Some Members may consider that\r\n\r\nthey are being asked to make a resolution which is\r\n\r\nultra  vires the section. They are at  liberty  to\r\n\r\nsay  so and, for that reason, to vote against  the\r\n\r\nresolution. Therefore I over-rule the objection of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the motion asks that the House decides that\r\n\r\nthe  uncertain  votes be deemed to  be  votes  for\r\n\r\nAlternative A and that the unmarked ballot  papers\r\n\r\nbe   left   to  the  decision  of  the  opposition\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  who  opposed the White  Paper  merger\r\n\r\nproposals.   But  let  me  say   from   the   very\r\n\r\nbeginning - and   as  the  Member  for   Anson   has\r\n\r\npartially pointed out   to  you  this motion is as\r\n\r\nfarcical  as the counting of the ballot papers  in\r\n\r\nthe   Badminton  Hall  and  the  whole  referendum\r\n\r\nitself. I do not intend to go into details  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat  happened during the counting of  the  ballot\r\n\r\npapers  in  the Badminton Hall. But I might  just\r\n\r\nsay  a  few  words in passing, that  although  the\r\n\r\ncounting  was supposed to have been done  division\r\n\r\nby division, we as counting agents had no means of\r\n\r\nchecking  whether the counting was, in fact,  done\r\n\r\ndivision  by division. All we could see  was  that\r\n\r\nthe  boxes  were apparently haphazardly placed  on\r\n\r\nthe   steps  of  the  Badminton  Hall - I  am   sure\r\n\r\naccording to a certain pre-arranged plan - and then,\r\n\r\napparently haphazardly again, dumped all over the\r\n\r\ntables. There were 51 tables in the Badminton Hall\r\n\r\nused  for  the counting of ballot papers,  with  a\r\n\r\ncouple of extra tables that were not used. All the\r\n\r\nboxes, according to the information given to us by\r\n\r\nthe  Superintendent  of the  National  Referendum,\r\n\r\nwere placed as they came in. But we could see that\r\n\r\nall of them had tags on them that had code numbers\r\n\r\nwhich were known only to the Government. And  when\r\n\r\nthese boxes were taken for counting to the tables,\r\n\r\nthey were taken not to the tables nearest to where\r\n\r\nthe boxes were originally placed, but in some pre-arranged  pattern - some here and  some  there - known\r\n\r\nonly  to the Government. We tried our best to find\r\n\r\nout which boxes came from which division and which\r\n\r\nboxes  went  to which table, but I regret  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  we were not able to find out. We managed  to\r\n\r\nfind   out  to  a  certain  extent  about  certain\r\n\r\ndivisions-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Even the pouring out of\r\n\r\nthe  ballot  papers was done in a  very  irregular\r\n\r\nmanner.  If you remember, Sir, according  to  law,\r\n\r\nall the ballot boxes are supposed to be assembled,\r\n\r\ninspected,  emptied of contents at the  same  time\r\n\r\nand  the  ballot  papers  mixed  together,  before\r\n\r\ncounting.  But this was never done.  Some  of  the\r\n\r\nballot papers were poured out from boxes on to the\r\n\r\ntable and while counting was done halfway, further\r\n\r\nboxes  were  added and emptied. In addition,  with\r\n\r\nall these boxes placed so close to one another, we\r\n\r\ncounting  agents had no opportunity whatsoever  of\r\n\r\nfinding out whether or not there was a mistake  or\r\n\r\na mixing up of the boxes. There was no possibility\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  of finding out as far as the  counting\r\n\r\nagents were concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was more reprehensible was that when\r\n\r\ncounting was done and when instructions were given\r\n\r\nto  the  counting clerks by the person who sat  at\r\n\r\nthe  head  of  the table I suppose  the  Presiding\r\n\r\nOfficers - they  were  all done surreptitiously  and\r\n\r\nsecretively;  all in whispers.

The P.A.P. never forgot  to  mention\r\n\r\nthis  over  their propaganda network,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nRadio  and Rediffusion, and all the time they  had\r\n\r\ntried  to boost support for the White Paper merger\r\n\r\nproposals  in  this  manner  by  saying  that   33\r\n\r\nsupported-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> And none against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, and none against. Over\r\n\r\nthe radio, Rediffusion and in speeches, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nkept  hammering this point home, that their merger\r\n\r\nproposals had the support of the majority  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  and  that  because  of  this   majority\r\n\r\nsupport in the Legislative Assembly, they had  the\r\n\r\nlegal  and  constitutional right to  push  through\r\n\r\ntheir    merger   proposals.   Therefore,    their\r\n\r\npropaganda says that this referendum was something\r\n\r\nwhich  the Government was now giving as a  special\r\n\r\nprivilege and favour to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I remind the House that all through the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the  Referendum Bill, both  in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  and  in  the  Legislative  Assembly  on\r\n\r\nrecommittal, the P.A.P. had taken the  stand  that\r\n\r\nthe  blank votes should become votes for the White\r\n\r\nPaper  of  the Government, that is for Alternative\r\n\r\nA,  as  put  forward  in the referendum?  All  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. arguments were based on this line and  they\r\n\r\nrejected  all  our arguments and contentions  that\r\n\r\nthe  blank votes meant non-support of any  of  the\r\n\r\nquestions posed in the referendum. They still  did\r\n\r\nthis not so very long ago,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly   in   July,  when  the  questions  for   the\r\n\r\nreferendum  were  debated. They  still  maintained\r\n\r\nthat  stand  then.  But now the  P.A.P. say  that\r\n\r\nuncertain and unmarked votes are votes not for the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. but for the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, we realise that the letter of the\r\n\r\nlaw  says  \"the  decision of  the  Assembly\".  But\r\n\r\neverybody   knows  that  the  \"decision   of   the\r\n\r\nAssembly\" on any important matter is the  decision\r\n\r\nof   the  Government.  And  the  decision  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is the decision of the P.A.P.  So  what\r\n\r\nare  they grumbling about? Why are they trying  to\r\n\r\ntell  the  people  all this nonsense  about  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  meaning B? Why did they want to start  this\r\n\r\nscare propaganda?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>\r\n\r\nWhat are you grumbling about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In the debate on clause 29 of\r\n\r\nthe  Referendum Bill, we had all along  maintained\r\n\r\nthat  blank  and  uncertain  votes  did  not  mean\r\n\r\nsupport for any of the alternatives to be posed to\r\n\r\nthe  people  in the referendum. As I have  already\r\n\r\nindicated, the P.A.P. kept on insisting that those\r\n\r\nwho  cast  blank  and  uncertain  votes  meant  an\r\n\r\nindecision in their minds on the matter, and  that\r\n\r\ntherefore  they  would  be  ready  to  accept  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Assembly on the matter. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbrought  in their so-called trump card  of  common\r\n\r\nMalaysian citizenship just before the announcement\r\n\r\nof  the date of the referendum. But even this  did\r\n\r\nnot  improve matters very much for them. Not until\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. initiated their final move, the  scare\r\n\r\npropaganda which as many have confirmed turned out\r\n\r\nto  be  the  genuine trump card of the P.A.P.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. trump  card was not the  so-called  common\r\n\r\nMalaysian  citizenship. The  trump  card  was  the\r\n\r\nscare  propaganda initiated by the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand his cronies all over Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of order.

In no time, the talk of the town was\r\n\r\n(1)  that  if you cast blank votes, you will  lose\r\n\r\nyour citizenship; (2) that if you cast blank votes\r\n\r\nyou  will be found out, because there is a  number\r\n\r\non  the  back of the ballot paper and  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwill  then  deal with you; (3) that  if  you  cast\r\n\r\nblank  votes  and if, as mentioned  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  there should be more  B  votes  than  A\r\n\r\nvotes,  then the blank votes might become B votes,\r\n\r\nand  therefore  that  would  entail  the  loss  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship for half the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these rumours were started by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand,  as  I  have  already indicated,  were  given\r\n\r\nofficial  impetus  by the Prime  Minister  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech  in  Fullerton  Square  on  Thursday,  23rd\r\n\r\nAugust,  1962.  This speech of the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwhich  said that blank votes might be turned  into\r\n\r\nvotes for B was, of course, specially aimed at the\r\n\r\n340,000  non-local  born Singapore  citizens.  The\r\n\r\nspeech  was  viewed  with such importance  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. that  they  had Radio  P.A.P. record  the\r\n\r\nspeech  and  had  it broadcast and rebroadcast.  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  speech of the Prime Minister  on  that\r\n\r\nparticular  occasion was broadcast four  times.  I\r\n\r\ncannot remember the exact number, but I definitely\r\n\r\nknow  that it was broadcast twice and there was  a\r\n\r\nlast  time which makes it definitely three  times.\r\n\r\nIt might have been more, I do not know; unless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou  keep listening in, you will not know.

They also had special\r\n\r\npolice  jeeps  going around from  place  to  place\r\n\r\ntelling the people of the danger of casting  blank\r\n\r\nvotes,   namely,  that  they  might   lose   their\r\n\r\ncitizenship, and that they must cast  their  votes\r\n\r\nfor   A.

But  more\r\n\r\nimportant, Sir, were those headlines meant for the\r\n\r\nChinese-speaking. They were worse. The evil genius\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. had grasped the most vital  point,\r\n\r\nthe  weakest  point, the Achilles  heel  of  those\r\n\r\nChinese  who  were non-locally born.

Sir,  I  got\r\n\r\nthem  from  the Nanyang Siang Pau of 26th  August,\r\n\r\npage 5. And then again in the Nanyang Siang Pau of\r\n\r\n28th  August,  page  5, again about  the  loss  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship. And on the 29th at page 14, this time\r\n\r\nit  says  Lee  Khoon Choy telling  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore:  \"Unless you vote for A you  will  lose\r\n\r\nyour  citizenship rights.\" All in headlines,  Sir.\r\n\r\nAnd then on 31st August, the Prime Minister in his\r\n\r\nanalysis said, \"If you cast blank votes, you  will\r\n\r\nlose  your  citizenship rights.\" All this  in  big\r\n\r\nheadlines, Sir, and all done with special emphasis\r\n\r\nand  directed  towards only  one  section  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  of  Singapore, namely,  the  non-local\r\n\r\nborn Singapore citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, an atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty,\r\n\r\nanxiety and suspense was created deliberately over\r\n\r\nthe whole of Singapore by these blatant falsehoods\r\n\r\nwhich came from the evil propaganda machine of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  And  the P.A.P. kept up the atmosphere  of\r\n\r\nfear   and   uncertainty  by  making  no   mention\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  of  the secrecy of the vote  in  their\r\n\r\nradio broadcasts. You see, Sir, the people were so\r\n\r\nscared  about the number on the back of the ballot\r\n\r\npaper.  They  were all afraid that  if  they  were\r\n\r\nfound  out, they would lose their jobs, they would\r\n\r\nlose  facilities for their school  children,  they\r\n\r\nwould lose welfare aid, they would lose facilities\r\n\r\nfor  application for Housing Board flats - all sorts\r\n\r\nof  things. This rumour started by the P.A.P. went\r\n\r\nround all over Singapore. As I said, this fear was\r\n\r\nheightened  by  the fact that the P.A.P. made  no\r\n\r\nmention  of the fact that the vote was  secret  in\r\n\r\ntheir radio broadcasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Let the Prime Minister in\r\n\r\nhis reply give an assurance on this point, and let\r\n\r\nit  be  categorical, in order to remove  the  fear\r\n\r\nwhich  was instilled into the hearts of the people\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. themselves.

What was the  decision  that  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  had  already made  on  the  main  merger\r\n\r\nissue?  It  is the White Paper passed in  November\r\n\r\n1961 - Command Paper 33 - and exactly as  put  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  now  as  question A in the referendum.  So\r\n\r\nwhat  is  all  this nonsense about a new  decision\r\n\r\nhaving   to  be  made  again  by  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly? Is that not proof enough that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  already said that the blank votes are P.A.P.\r\n\r\nvotes?  Then, Sir, in the petition from the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  to the United Nations, in reply  to  the\r\n\r\npetition  from  the 19 Opposition Assemblymen  and\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Council  of  Joint  Action,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  did  not  deny the facts  as  stated  in\r\n\r\nparagraph  14 of our petition. This  is  from  the\r\n\r\npetition from Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, concerning Singapore, dated 26th  July,\r\n\r\n1962, from the United Nations.

Again,\r\n\r\nSir,   in  the  United  Nations,  when  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  obviously did not feel competent  enough\r\n\r\nto speak on the Referendum Ordinance, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  said this.

Has all this been forgotten?\r\n\r\nThis  is  clear  proof, Sir, that they  themselves\r\n\r\nhave admitted that the decision of the Assembly on\r\n\r\nthe  matter  referred for the  referendum  is  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper - now,  of  course,  amended  with  the\r\n\r\naddition of their so-called Malaysian citizenship.\r\n\r\nSo  what  is  all  this  farce  about  asking  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  for a decision on the blank votes,  when\r\n\r\nthe  decision  has  already been  made?  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nreason,  of  course, is not far  to  seek.  It  is\r\n\r\nsimply this. The Prime Minister has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbrought  forward  this  motion  with  two  obvious\r\n\r\nreasons.  One is to cover the falsehood which  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  himself has uttered,  that  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  might  mean support for Alternative  B.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, now they say, bring it to the Assembly and\r\n\r\nlet  the  Assembly decide. Second, what I  suppose\r\n\r\nwould  be more important to the propaganda machine\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P., is that the P.A.P. want to create\r\n\r\nthe  illusion that the decision of the Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly   may   not  be  the  decision   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and therefore, of the P.A.P.,  because\r\n\r\nnow they say, \"We abstain. You decide.\" Therefore,\r\n\r\nunder  those  circumstances, on important  matters\r\n\r\nthe  decision of the Assembly may not  necessarily\r\n\r\nbe  the  decision of the governing Party. That  is\r\n\r\nthe  impression and the illusion which the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave to create in the minds of the people. If that\r\n\r\nimpression  and illusion should be  created,  then\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister can go back and say, \"There you\r\n\r\nare.  I  have  spoken the truth. I have  told  you\r\n\r\nexactly what was the true position.\" But in actual\r\n\r\nfact,   the   Prime  Minister  has  been   telling\r\n\r\nfalsehoods  right from the word go - all  the  time.\r\n\r\nThey  have  given  out  this  falsehood  with  the\r\n\r\ndeliberate  intention to frighten  and  intimidate\r\n\r\npeople into supporting A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, just as the referendum is merely\r\n\r\nto  provide a facade of democracy and a facade for\r\n\r\nso-called  consultation  with  the  people,   this\r\n\r\nmotion  is  a cover for the falsehoods  that  were\r\n\r\nuttered  by the P.A.P., and the Prime Minister  in\r\n\r\nparticular,   during   this   present   referendum\r\n\r\ncampaign. If the P.A.P. had any real intention  of\r\n\r\nletting  the  blank  votes to be  decided  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition Assemblymen, the P.A.P. should have  so\r\n\r\nstated  from the very beginning. They should  have\r\n\r\nsaid  so  in the beginning that if you cast  blank\r\n\r\nvotes,  the  blank votes would be decided  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition Assemblymen. Why did they not  say  so?\r\n\r\nAgain,  Sir,  if  there was  such  intention,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. need not have debated so hotly against  us\r\n\r\nand  contested every amendment we made  concerning\r\n\r\nsection  29. If you will remember, Sir, we debated\r\n\r\nvery hotly clause 29, both in the Select Committee\r\n\r\nand  on  recommittal in the Assembly. And when  we\r\n\r\nmoved that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   whole  clause  29  be  deleted,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nrejected our amendment. Thus clause 29 was  all  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. show.  Again if they had  really  intended\r\n\r\nthat  the  blank votes be left to the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition Assemblymen, then the P.A.P. need\r\n\r\nnot have been so secretive and so surreptitious in\r\n\r\nthe  way they counted those blank votes. There was\r\n\r\nno  decision to count those blank votes separately\r\n\r\nuntil,  I think, round about 4.00 a.m. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. chaps had earlier been  going  around\r\n\r\nrecording  the  number of votes  for  the  various\r\n\r\ncategories  and  going back  to  tell  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbosses.  But there was no indication  of  how  the\r\n\r\ncounting  was  to  be  done until  the  very  last\r\n\r\nminute.   And  the  Prime  Minister  himself   was\r\n\r\ndirecting  operations at every stage of the  show.\r\n\r\nThe  Superintendent was merely his  page  boy.  He\r\n\r\nhanded  my letter over to the Prime Minister.  The\r\n\r\nSuperintendent never made the decisions. The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  made  the decisions and  directed  every\r\n\r\nstage of the operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since this motion now centres on section\r\n\r\n29,  it  is  necessary for me  to  mention  a  few\r\n\r\nrelevant  facts in order to place this  motion  in\r\n\r\nits   proper   perspective.  As  I  have   already\r\n\r\nindicated,  Sir, in the first place,  it  was  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. who put in clause 29 - now section 29. It was\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. that railroaded, pushed through  this\r\n\r\nsection  29  to make it law, in spite of  all  the\r\n\r\nprotests  from not only Assemblymen here but  also\r\n\r\ncivic   organisations,  professional  bodies   and\r\n\r\neverybody in Singapore. Everybody knows that it is\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. that  is completely  responsible  for\r\n\r\nsection  29. We have repeatedly stated  that  this\r\n\r\nsham referendum held under such a sham, ridiculous\r\n\r\nand  undemocratic way would not reflect  the  true\r\n\r\nwill and desire of the people of Singapore. It  is\r\n\r\nbecause  of  this, Sir, that we also  brought  the\r\n\r\nmatter  up  to  the  Committee  of  Seventeen   on\r\n\r\nColonialism  in the United Nations.  All  we  have\r\n\r\nasked  for  is a fair, honest and just referendum.\r\n\r\nBut  what  we  have just witnessed  was  something\r\n\r\nwhich  had already been rigged to give a sure  win\r\n\r\nto  the  P.A.P. heads the P.A.P. win,  tails  the\r\n\r\npeople lose. A sure win referendum for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  If it had been an honest  referendum,\r\n\r\nwith  the people having the right of dissent, with\r\n\r\nthe  people having the right to say \"no\", and with\r\n\r\nabsolutely  no fear whatsoever that the dissenting\r\n\r\nvotes  would  be  construed to  mean  support  for\r\n\r\nAlternative A or Alternative B as put  up  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  we  would  have  willingly  accepted  the\r\n\r\nresult  as  truly  reflecting the  free  will  and\r\n\r\ndesire  of  the people. But such is not the  case.\r\n\r\nEven if the result had shown a majority of only 51\r\n\r\nper  cent, we would still have accepted it and  we\r\n\r\nwould  have done our best to help work it, however\r\n\r\nwe  may feel against the whole result. But when we\r\n\r\nknow   only  too  well  that  the  referendum   is\r\n\r\ndishonest  right  to the core,  to  recognise  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  such a dishonest referendum  would  be\r\n\r\ntantamount  to condoning dishonesty and,  what  is\r\n\r\nworse, to encouraging a future repetition of  such\r\n\r\ndishonesty. Sir, we fully recognise and accept the\r\n\r\nfact  that amongst those who voted for Alternative\r\n\r\nA in the referendum, there were many who did so in\r\n\r\nthe sincere belief that Alternative A was to their\r\n\r\ninterests. To these people, we say that we respect\r\n\r\ntheir  belief and their choice, and  if  they  had\r\n\r\ncomprised  the  majority in an  honest  referendum\r\n\r\ncarried  out  without section 29 intimidating  the\r\n\r\npeople,  we  would have willingly  abided  by  the\r\n\r\ndecision.  But it must be admitted  that  in  this\r\n\r\nsham  referendum there were those  who  voted  for\r\n\r\nAlternative   A,   not  because   they   supported\r\n\r\nAlternative A, but because they feared Alternative\r\n\r\nB   and   because  they  feared  their   loss   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  loss of their means  of  livelihood,\r\n\r\nloss  of  welfare  aid and housing  accommodation.\r\n\r\nThis  fear  of  Alternative B, together  with  the\r\n\r\nother  fear of loss of citizenship with consequent\r\n\r\nloss  of livelihood, was entirely due to the scare\r\n\r\npropaganda initiated by the P.A.P. helped  by  the\r\n\r\nexistence   of   section  29  in  the   Referendum\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Section 29, though originally  created\r\n\r\nby  the  P.A.P. as an ultimate weapon  to  ensure\r\n\r\ndefinite  victory  for  the  White  Paper   merger\r\n\r\nproposals, should the White Paper merger proposals\r\n\r\nfail to get popular support, has now turned out to\r\n\r\nbe  even more useful to the P.A.P. as a weapon  in\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreferendum  campaign  to  coerce  non-local   born\r\n\r\ncitizens into supporting Alternative A because  of\r\n\r\ntheir fear of Alternative B winning, according  to\r\n\r\nthe words of the Prime Minister, \"by default\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to add a few words more, Sir,\r\n\r\nabout  the  rumours  which the  P.A.P. have  been\r\n\r\nspreading around and it is this - the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhimself   can  check.  To  frighten  people   into\r\n\r\nsupporting \"A\", the Prime Minister said that there\r\n\r\nwere  a lot of Malays in Singapore who were  going\r\n\r\nto vote for Alternative B. This put more fear into\r\n\r\nthe  hearts of those non-local born Chinese.  They\r\n\r\ncould  not possibly allow such a thing to  happen.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is very important that we remember  this\r\n\r\nfear  of loss of citizenship. The Chinese in  this\r\n\r\ncountry, those who were not born here, have fought\r\n\r\nmany  years for this right, and any fear that such\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights might be taken away from  them,\r\n\r\nwill  make them fight and do anything possible  to\r\n\r\nretain that citizenship. I here condemn the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  for initiating such a communal  argument\r\n\r\nin   the   propaganda  campaign  for  support   of\r\n\r\nAlternative A. This is a most dangerous line.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. had  all  along been  trying  to  frighten\r\n\r\ncertain  sections  of  the people  with  arguments\r\n\r\nwhich  are  completely communal. I hope  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will realise that such arguments  are  not\r\n\r\nconducive  to  the  welfare  of  the  people  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they should immediately take  steps  to\r\n\r\nrefrain   from   further  use  of  such   communal\r\n\r\narguments in their propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is still another fear which I might\r\n\r\nadd, and it is this; a lot of people in Singapore,\r\n\r\nalthough unwilling to support Alternative  A,  but\r\n\r\nbecause of the fact that there are numbers on  the\r\n\r\nback  of the ballot papers, nevertheless fear that\r\n\r\nif  they  should cast votes for Alternative  B  or\r\n\r\nAlternative  C or blank, i.e. against  Alternative\r\n\r\nA,  then  they might be found out; and  they  know\r\n\r\nthat  whether they cast blank votes or  votes  for\r\n\r\nAlternative A, all these votes would still  become\r\n\r\nGovernment votes and the P.A.P. would still be the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Everybody fears the P.A.P. nowadays.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows how ruthless the P.A.P. can be. We\r\n\r\nfeel that is why some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  have put discretion as the better part  of\r\n\r\nvalour.

Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that the P.A.P. have made full use of\r\n\r\nsection  29  to achieve their aims, they  want  to\r\n\r\nappear  as innocent angels and hope to wash  their\r\n\r\nhands  of  something of their  own  creation.  The\r\n\r\nmotion  now  asks  the Opposition  Assemblymen  to\r\n\r\ndecide  on the fate of the unmarked ballot papers.\r\n\r\nWe   in   the  Barisan  Sosialis  have  all  along\r\n\r\nmaintained  that all those who cast  uncertain  or\r\n\r\nblank  ballot papers are those who do not  support\r\n\r\nany one of the alternatives posed to the people in\r\n\r\nthe  referendum.

You  remember,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, how hard we fought for  automatic\r\n\r\ncitizenship  and for how long, and how  we  were\r\n\r\nsneered at by the Front Bench and called  \"anti-national\",   \"pro-Communist\"  and  \"anti-merger\"\r\n\r\nbecause we asked for automatic citizenship which\r\n\r\nthey said they would not even negotiate with the\r\n\r\nFederation   since   it  was   impossible!   The\r\n\r\nOpposition   asked  for  the   impossible!   The\r\n\r\nOpposition  was anti-national because  we  asked\r\n\r\nfor automatic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizenship! The Opposition was pro-Communist because\r\n\r\nwe  asked  for automatic citizenship! The  Opposition\r\n\r\nwas  anti-merger  and was asking for  the  impossible\r\n\r\nbecause  we asked for automatic citizenship!  Now  we\r\n\r\nhave automatic citizenship. And, Sir, we have genuine\r\n\r\nmerger surely  a miracle which should  be  recognised\r\n\r\nand  respected  to the extent that the P.A.P. should\r\n\r\ntake advantage of it to produce a clean motion before\r\n\r\nthis Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only was there one miracle, Mr Speaker, but we\r\n\r\nhad a second miracle, the miracle that the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  swallowed the filthy, immoral  referendum,\r\n\r\nand the majority of them despite their recognition of\r\n\r\nits  disgraceful  character, despite  their  disgust,\r\n\r\nnevertheless  voted  in  favour  of  Alternative   A.\r\n\r\n397,626  citizens  cast  their  votes  in  favour  of\r\n\r\nAlternative  A out of a total electorate of  624,000.\r\n\r\nEven  assuming  every one of the 624,000  voters  was\r\n\r\nalive on Referendum Day, and even assuming that  they\r\n\r\nwere  all in Singapore, which is absurd, nevertheless\r\n\r\nthat  makes a total in favour of Alternative A  of  a\r\n\r\nclear 64 per cent of the entire electorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded in this context, Mr Speaker, to draw\r\n\r\nattention  to another aspect in view of the amendment\r\n\r\nmoved by the Member for Queenstown on the recommittal\r\n\r\nof  the Bill to this House on 5th July, which appears\r\n\r\nat  page 41 of the unrevised transcript [Vol. 18, No.\r\n\r\n7, col. 851]. He moved a new clause:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The result of the referendum shall not be valid\r\n\r\nunless  a proposition is supported in the affirmative\r\n\r\nby  not  less  than fifty-one per cent of  the  total\r\n\r\nvotes cast.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Not  \"of the total electorate\". Mr Speaker, but  \"of\r\n\r\nthe  total votes cast\". Now if you take the total  of\r\n\r\nthe votes cast, that is 561,559, there is, in fact, a\r\n\r\nclear majority of 71 per cent in favour; 20 per  cent\r\n\r\nmore than the Member for Queenstown asked for on  the\r\n\r\n5th of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two miracles have made it unnecessary for the\r\n\r\nperpetuation   of  the  dishonesty  for   which   the\r\n\r\nfoundation  was  laid  by  this  Government  in   the\r\n\r\nReferendum Ordinance. Why do we pursue those tactics,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker? Why can we not go cleanly and peacefully\r\n\r\ninto this merger? Why must we follow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis   tortuous  P.A.P. path?  We  know   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  expected that the majority of the  people\r\n\r\nwould vote against the merger proposals, and that  is\r\n\r\nwhy  we  have this farcical Referendum Ordinance  and\r\n\r\nthe  farcical  referendum whereby only Alternative  A\r\n\r\nhad  any  meaning.  Alternative B,  according  to  an\r\n\r\nopinion,  Mr  Speaker, which I  would  be  happy  to\r\n\r\ntable, obtained from Mr Dingle Foot, Queen's Counsel\r\n\r\nand  Member  of Parliament, a constitutional  lawyer,\r\n\r\nwas meaningless as regards citizenship. Alternative C\r\n\r\nwas  admitted  by the Prime Minister  himself  to  be\r\n\r\nambiguous.  Let me read it to you. I  read  from  the\r\n\r\ntranscript  of  the  United Nations  meeting  of  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Committee of 17 Nations on Colonialism in New\r\n\r\nYork  on  26th  July, 1962, at 3.00  p.m.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of Singapore was speaking then:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I admit that the third Alternative - \"on terms no\r\n\r\nless  favourable  than Borneo\" - is vague  because  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  terms,  although  part  of  them  have   been\r\n\r\ndiscussed publicly, have not been crystallized in the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper in proper form, as has Alternative A, hut\r\n\r\nthey  will be. I would have thought that my political\r\n\r\nopponents would at least have given me the credit  of\r\n\r\npossessing some generosity [I am glad he did not  say\r\n\r\nintegrity]  and  some good sense in not  putting  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  questions until Alternative  C  has  been\r\n\r\npublished and clarified.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Have we had a White Paper, Mr Speaker? No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then finally, Sir, this provision in the Ordinance,\r\n\r\nthat  blank votes are to be added to the total  votes\r\n\r\nfor  A without being separately declared. I think  it\r\n\r\nis  important  to recognise this dishonesty  and  the\r\n\r\nlack   of  their  utilisation  at  present.  I   draw\r\n\r\nattention  to  page  32 of the  proceedings  of  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  on  4th July, 1962, [Vol. 18, No.  6,  col.\r\n\r\n712] in which I moved an amendment to clause 29:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`So that the sub-clause will now read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The number of such ballot papers shall be counted\r\n\r\nand    shall   be   separately   included   by    the\r\n\r\nSuperintendent in his declaration of  the  result  of\r\n\r\nthe referendum.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I then urged that we should publish the number of blank ballot papers separately so that\r\n\r\nthe people should know what the voting was like. This\r\n\r\nwas strongly resisted and the Government, assisted by\r\n\r\nthe Front\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBench  of the Opposition, negatived it by 24 votes\r\n\r\nto 17 Opposition votes. They refused to permit the\r\n\r\nseparate publication of the number of blank votes.\r\n\r\nLet  us remember that. And it was made clear  that\r\n\r\nthese  would not be published unless the votes  in\r\n\r\nfavour  of  Alternative A well exceeded the  blank\r\n\r\nvotes, which has happened fortunately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a result of the voting of the people,\r\n\r\nall  this dishonesty is now unnecessary. The  vote\r\n\r\nis  clear. The acceptance of the merger proposals,\r\n\r\nas amended, is unequivocal by 71 per cent majority\r\n\r\nof  the  votes cast, 64 per cent majority  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal  number  of citizens on the electoral  roll.\r\n\r\nThe  Barisan  Sosialis,  through  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, suggest - and suggest, Sir, not without\r\n\r\nreason - that  there has been dishonest  conduct  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  the  Prime Minister  and  dishonest\r\n\r\nintimidation  by the Prime Minister through  false\r\n\r\nstatements - I make this knowingly.

I always wonder how  wrong  I  am\r\n\r\nwhen he agrees with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Mr Speaker, let us go back to the\r\n\r\nfundamental  issue that in a democracy  we  accept\r\n\r\nthe will of the majority. The will of the majority\r\n\r\nhas   been  indicated  in  a  clear  vote  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  There  is  an  allegation  that  this\r\n\r\nreferendum   result   was   brought    about    by\r\n\r\nintimidation.  As  you  yourself  have   indicated\r\n\r\nearlier,  the proper place for that allegation  is\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Referendum Court and  the  Referendum\r\n\r\nJudge, and until the Referendum Judge accepts that\r\n\r\ncontention  and  nullifies  the  returns,  we   as\r\n\r\ndemocrats should not say, as I was rather  unhappy\r\n\r\nto  hear the Member for Queenstown say, \"We do not\r\n\r\naccept the returns because they were the result of\r\n\r\nintimidation.\" We accept the returns as we  accept\r\n\r\nthe judgment of the Court of first instance, until\r\n\r\nyou have appealed it and only after the appeal has\r\n\r\nbeen  upheld. Here I have not heard of any  appeal\r\n\r\nto  the  Referendum Judge and I have not heard  of\r\n\r\nany  suggestion  of  an appeal to  the  Referendum\r\n\r\nJudge. In the circumstances, I would suggest to my\r\n\r\nfriend,  the  Member  for  Queenstown,  that   the\r\n\r\nstatement  he has made is wholly inappropriate  in\r\n\r\nthe  context  of  his  stand  in  support  of  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  principle of the majority  will  being\r\n\r\nrespected.  I recognise that that does  not  mean,\r\n\r\nthough we accept the majority will, that, in fact,\r\n\r\nthe  majority are necessarily happy with  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  injustices which the White Paper perpetrates,\r\n\r\nalbeit of an incidental character. I for one would\r\n\r\ncertainly  do  what I can within my competence  to\r\n\r\nseek amelioration of those conditions, either  now\r\n\r\nor after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir   incorporation   in  the   Constitution   of\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  in  order  to obtain  full  justice  and\r\n\r\nequality for the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. today, I repeat, have the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  act honestly yet to obtain what it seeks. There\r\n\r\nwas  no  need  to invoke the rubbish, the  dirt  of\r\n\r\nsection 29, it affects nothing at all. No one  will\r\n\r\nlook  at  it. Certainly least of all the Federation\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  who  is concerned.  I  think,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  it  is  most unfair to suggest  that  the\r\n\r\n144,000  votes which were blank were, in the  words\r\n\r\nof  the  Prime Minister, \"anti-merger\".  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister knows full well that my Party and  I  made\r\n\r\nit  plain  after  the announcement of  the  changed\r\n\r\ncitizenship  proposals that we accepted  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper as amended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

We made it equally plain that we  advised\r\n\r\nthe people to cast blank votes as a protest against\r\n\r\nthe  referendum provisions, not against  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.  That is why I am particularly happy to  see\r\n\r\nthat my friend, the Member for Queenstown, has  not\r\n\r\nsuggested  in his amendment that the 144,000  blank\r\n\r\nvotes should be deemed to reject proposals A, B  or\r\n\r\nC,  but  that they should be deemed to be  cast  in\r\n\r\nprotest, as protest votes, because, Sir, I for  one\r\n\r\ntell you frankly, I cast a blank vote not because I\r\n\r\nam  against A. I support A fully. But because I was\r\n\r\nagainst  that disgraceful referendum and I  refused\r\n\r\nto participate in it more than the law compelled me\r\n\r\nto.

In fact, Sir, we  have  it  in  our\r\n\r\nElections  Ordinance which is still in  force,  in\r\n\r\nsection  41(d) and (e) . Unfortunately, we had  the\r\n\r\nstory  then  in  Select Committee that  there  was\r\n\r\ngoing to be a Communist-mounted campaign, and as a\r\n\r\nresult,  they  wanted  to  have  the  right   that\r\n\r\nunmarked and blank ballot papers should also count\r\n\r\nwith  A, as was read out to you by the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.  That was approved  by  5  to  4,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker - 5        Government       against        4\r\n\r\nOpposition - including, at that time, the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill.  On  recommittal  to  this  House,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown  moved  an  amendment  to\r\n\r\nclause  28,  which  would  have  made  blank   and\r\n\r\nuncertain ballot papers void and invalid,  and  in\r\n\r\nthat  I fully supported him.

Finally,  Sir,\r\n\r\nlet us look at section 29. You will remember, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat it took three days of debate in the Assembly,\r\n\r\napart  from  the  lengthy  debate  in  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  in  which  the Barisan  Sosialis,  the\r\n\r\nU.P.P. and   the  Workers'  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParty   consistently\r\n\r\nmaintained that blank and uncertain ballot  papers\r\n\r\nshould not count.

Government votes, Sir, In respect  of\r\n\r\nsection 29, I moved an amendment, trying to do the\r\n\r\nbest  we could of a bad job, that an unmarked  and\r\n\r\nuncertain ballot paper shall be deemed to be of  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  is  not  in  favour  of  any  of  the\r\n\r\nproposals  posed  by  the referendum  or  has  not\r\n\r\nunderstood  the  question or the instructions  for\r\n\r\nvoting. Again this was negatived by the Government\r\n\r\nand  the Front Bench Opposition by a total  of  25\r\n\r\nvotes to 18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Something wrong with your\r\n\r\narithmetic!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, had the referendum\r\n\r\nbeen  the other way, had there been 144,000  votes\r\n\r\nfor  A and 397,000 blank, we would have been  told\r\n\r\nthat the Assembly having already decided in favour\r\n\r\nof  the White Paper proposals, Command Paper 33 of\r\n\r\n1961,  we should not know, and the totals must  be\r\n\r\nadded  together, and there were  95  per  cent  in\r\n\r\nfavour.  As the Member for Queenstown has  already\r\n\r\nindicated from the statements made by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance, it was intended that the blank votes\r\n\r\nshould  be  added to A. In fact, this was  clearly\r\n\r\nindicated to us by the Government and accepted  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government as the true position when  it  was\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to the United Nations. Now,  Sir,  they\r\n\r\nare in the happy position of being able to publish\r\n\r\nthe  number  of the blank votes.

Then,  Sir,  why  this\r\n\r\ndisgraceful  provision  about  wanting  the  2,000\r\n\r\nvotes,  going a begging for 2,000 votes  that  are\r\n\r\nuncertain,   which  in  civilised  countries   are\r\n\r\nnaturally accepted as void?

I predicted a 98  per\r\n\r\ncent  or a 99 per cent victory for the Government,\r\n\r\nbecause the Government had said during the  debate\r\n\r\non clause 29 that it would include all blank votes\r\n\r\nas   White  Paper  votes  and  this  is  what  has\r\n\r\nhappened. Anyhow, to us, this referendum is only a\r\n\r\nvictory in name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer to the Assembly debate on the 10th\r\n\r\nof  July, 1962, page 52? During the debate on  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill, I made very briefly my assessment\r\n\r\nof the position, and what I said in those days had\r\n\r\ncome  true.  It is at page 52, about the  14th  or\r\n\r\n15th line from the top [Vol. 19, No. 2, col. 214]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nothing arising from this debate could alter\r\n\r\nthe Government's basic tactical position, which is\r\n\r\nto put proposals or alternatives more unacceptable\r\n\r\nthan  the White Paper proposals. And you  have  no\r\n\r\nbetter  proof than from the horse's mouth  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance.  Any  genuine  alternative\r\n\r\ncould   not   be   accepted  by  the   Government.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir, by putting in more  alternatives,\r\n\r\nmore  proposals or amendments which are acceptable\r\n\r\nto  the Government, they would only be serving  to\r\n\r\nconfuse the issue at stake. The issue is that  the\r\n\r\npeople  should  be asked to accept or  reject  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper. If that is the question to be posed,\r\n\r\nthere would be no doubt about the outcome. But  as\r\n\r\nthings are, the Government would push through this\r\n\r\nsham  referendum and steam-roller its White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposal through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should the people do in the circumstances?\r\n\r\nIf  the  voter does not go and vote, he loses  his\r\n\r\nvote in future elections. If he tears his vote  or\r\n\r\ndefaces  it, he will go to gaol. If he writes  his\r\n\r\nname   and   address,  he  is  afraid   of   being\r\n\r\nintimidated. Sir, if he throws in a blank vote  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  considered a pro-Government  vote.  But\r\n\r\nfaced  with these possible courses of action,  our\r\n\r\nstand  is  that the people should throw  in  blank\r\n\r\nvotes,  which  is the least of the evils.  If  the\r\n\r\nblank  votes are more than the votes for the White\r\n\r\nPaper,  then the Government would keep quiet.  But\r\n\r\nif  the votes for the White Paper exceed the blank\r\n\r\nvotes,  not for any reason but merely because  the\r\n\r\nvoter is faced with impossible alternatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  in desperation throws his vote for the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  proposals, then we may be giving Government\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to announce separately the number\r\n\r\nof  votes  supporting the White Paper and  thereby\r\n\r\nmount  a propaganda campaign to convince the world\r\n\r\nthat  the  majority  of  Singapore  citizens  have\r\n\r\nsupported the White Paper and have done so without\r\n\r\ncounting the blank votes.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is exactly what has\r\n\r\nhappened  today.  This is the reason  why  we  are\r\n\r\nhaving  an  emergency sitting today, so  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government can go and blast it off in  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations to people who do not know the  true\r\n\r\nsituation    here.    With   these    unacceptable\r\n\r\nalternatives put in the referendum ballot  papers,\r\n\r\nand    with    section   29,   with   undemocratic\r\n\r\nrestrictions  placed on Opposition Parties  during\r\n\r\nthe  referendum campaign, and to culminate it all,\r\n\r\nthe  last-minute  intimidation and  trick  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  propagated  through  the  radio   and\r\n\r\nRediffusion,  conveying to voters  the  impression\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  lose their citizenship,  thereby\r\n\r\nresulting  in  the  loss of  other  benefits  like\r\n\r\nschooling, medical aid, housing and social welfare\r\n\r\nand  so  on, it is heartening to us to  note  that\r\n\r\nthere are so many people who are prepared to  face\r\n\r\nall  these dire consequences, and cast blank votes\r\n\r\nin  protest against the White Paper. In our  view,\r\n\r\nthese  were mostly the people who had, during  the\r\n\r\nshort  campaign fixed by the Government,  attended\r\n\r\nthe   rallies  and  the  street  meetings  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties where the bluff of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment could be effectively exposed. But, Sir,\r\n\r\ndue  to  all sorts of restrictions imposed by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Opposition was unable to  organise\r\n\r\nmore  effectively  during  the  few  days  of  the\r\n\r\ncampaign,  to  counter the Government's  intensive\r\n\r\npropaganda and intimidatory tricks over the  radio\r\n\r\nand  Rediffusion, that if the citizens cast  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  they  would  lose  their  citizenship   and\r\n\r\nconsequently other benefits would be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I take this opportunity to\r\n\r\ndescribe  to you the importance of the  radio  and\r\n\r\nRediffusion  in  this short campaign?  The  object\r\n\r\nlesson   we   have  learnt  from  this  referendum\r\n\r\ncampaign  is the influence of these two  means  of\r\n\r\npropaganda, namely, the radio and Rediffusion, and\r\n\r\nthe extent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto which the Government is prepared to make use of\r\n\r\nthese means of propaganda in order to achieve  its\r\n\r\nnefarious  ends.

When I heard it, it  gave  me  the\r\n\r\nimpression  that if we cast blank  votes  we  were\r\n\r\nlikely  to  lose our citizenship and thereby  lose\r\n\r\nall rights of citizenship. We would not be able to\r\n\r\nsend  our  children to school; there would  be  no\r\n\r\nmedical  aid, no housing flats, no social  welfare\r\n\r\nand other such things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of the influence of the radio, I\r\n\r\nremember having read that on a certain day in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States,  where most  of  the  people  have\r\n\r\nattended secondary schools, the radio put  over  a\r\n\r\nmock  programme announcing a Martian  invasion  of\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> A Marshall invasion!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> There was panic immediately\r\n\r\namong  the  people.  Millions  rushed  from  their\r\n\r\nhouses  to  safety. And this is what  happened  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  during  the  last  few  days   of   the\r\n\r\nreferendum  campaign. Every few minutes  over  the\r\n\r\nradio, the Government impressed on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people  that  if they cast blank  votes  they\r\n\r\nwould  lose their citizenship. And there was panic\r\n\r\namong  the  people. And because of  all  sorts  of\r\n\r\nrestrictions imposed on the Opposition Parties, we\r\n\r\ncould  not  paste posters announcing our  rallies.\r\n\r\nSection   42  of  the  Referendum  Ordinance   was\r\n\r\ninterpreted in such a way that we could not  paste\r\n\r\nposters  announcing our rallies. So, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Government's  radio  campaign  was   so\r\n\r\neffective  that it created a panic.  And  we,  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties, who have  no  access  to  the\r\n\r\nradio, were not given an opportunity to expose the\r\n\r\nbluff,  within  so short a time of as  during  the\r\n\r\nlast three to four days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is therefore our contention that the\r\n\r\nresults published in the Report do not reflect the\r\n\r\ntrue  wishes of the people. In a letter dated 12th\r\n\r\nOctober,   1961,  the  Prime  Minister  gave   the\r\n\r\nfollowing assurance to the Opposition Parties:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is the intention of the Government, when all\r\n\r\nthe  details  have been worked out, to  publish  a\r\n\r\nPaper and table it in the Legislative Assembly for\r\n\r\ndebate.  Then  the  people can  accept  or  reject\r\n\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Subsequently, the Government broke its promise and\r\n\r\nchanged  its mind over putting the White Paper  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  in a yes or no referendum because  it\r\n\r\nstarted  realising  that  the  White  Paper  would\r\n\r\nreceive  an  overwhelming defeat. A  way  out  was\r\n\r\nthought  of and worse alternatives than the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  were found and placed on the ballot  paper.\r\n\r\nIf   the   people  wanted  to  protest  in   those\r\n\r\ncircumstances, they could only put in blank votes,\r\n\r\nand  the  putting in of blank votes was  something\r\n\r\nnew to the electorate of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, we were given only two\r\n\r\nshort weeks. During those two short weeks, it  was\r\n\r\nnot  possible  for us to explain  to  the  600,000\r\n\r\nvoters  of  Singapore  how to  cast  blank  votes.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the  P.A.P.  Government  countered  the\r\n\r\nblank  vote campaign in two ways. Firstly, by  the\r\n\r\nnotorious  section 29 of the Referendum Ordinance.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  is important: rightly or wrongly,  many\r\n\r\nvoters  thought that if they threw in blank votes,\r\n\r\ntheir citizenship would be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken  away.  The  voter felt  that  there  was  a\r\n\r\npossibility of the Government knowing his identity\r\n\r\nas  there  was a number on the back of the  ballot\r\n\r\npaper.  In  a  democratic system,  the  number  is\r\n\r\nactually  meant  to protect the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,   to   minimise  the  possibility   of\r\n\r\nGovernment-rigging, but certain misinformed though\r\n\r\nperhaps well-intentioned people campaigned in  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  against the number on the back  of  the\r\n\r\nballot  paper. Although the campaign was withdrawn\r\n\r\ntowards  the  later stages when  the  mistake  was\r\n\r\nrealised, the impression of a number on  the  back\r\n\r\nof  the  ballot paper stuck in the  minds  of  the\r\n\r\nvoters.  Therefore, many voters were  afraid  that\r\n\r\nthrough  the  numbers they could be identified  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government and therefore be deprived of their\r\n\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the second cunning stroke of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government - and due credit must be given  to\r\n\r\nour  famous Minister for Culture - was to compel all\r\n\r\nvoters  on  polling  day to go  into  the  polling\r\n\r\nbooths  even  if they wanted to cast  blank  votes\r\n\r\nMany  voters  who wanted to cast  blank  votes  by\r\n\r\nwalking  straight  up  to the  ballot  boxes  were\r\n\r\ncaught by surprise when they were compelled by the\r\n\r\npolling clerks - on orders from the Government, I am\r\n\r\nsure - to  go into the polling booths. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  many  of the voters had the impression  that\r\n\r\nthey  had  to put a cross against any one  of  the\r\n\r\nthree  Alternatives  A, B or C.  And  having  gone\r\n\r\nthrough an intensive propaganda campaign which was\r\n\r\ncarried  out by the Government over the radio  and\r\n\r\nRediffusion,   they  knew  that   of   the   three\r\n\r\nalternatives, A was the least evil and  therefore,\r\n\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, they voted for A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the effect of the radio and\r\n\r\nRediffusion could be seen most clearly during  the\r\n\r\ncounting  of the votes. It was apparent  from  the\r\n\r\ncounting  that  in  places like the  rural  areas,\r\n\r\nwhere there is no Rediffusion or radio because  of\r\n\r\na  lack  of  electricity supply, there  were  more\r\n\r\nblank  votes  than  in areas  in  Chinatown  where\r\n\r\nalmost  every household has either a  radio  or  a\r\n\r\nRediffusion set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What does that prove?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They have get transistor\r\n\r\nsets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion\r\n\r\nis   brought   up  today  because  the  Government\r\n\r\nconsiders that it has won a so-called victory.  It\r\n\r\nis  nothing but just a means of gaining  publicity\r\n\r\nand  to  mount a propaganda campaign to show  that\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of the people are not  against  the\r\n\r\nWhite Paper proposals. We feel that the purpose of\r\n\r\nthis  motion before the House is to wash the dirty\r\n\r\nhands  of the Government of the notorious  section\r\n\r\n29   by   pushing   on  to  the   Opposition   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of deciding how  the  blank  votes\r\n\r\nshould  be allocated. During the debate on  clause\r\n\r\n29,  I  remember that many Government  Assemblymen\r\n\r\nsaid  that blank votes would be considered as pro-White  Paper  votes. But today, as on  many  other\r\n\r\nprevious occasions, they have changed their stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, today, the\r\n\r\nGovernment   want  to  appear  to  be   fair   and\r\n\r\nreasonable. They have convened this sitting to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition to decide what should be done with\r\n\r\nthe  unmarked  and uncertain votes. They  want  to\r\n\r\ngive  the impression that they are fair, that they\r\n\r\ndo not want to take the decision, although the law\r\n\r\nallows  them  to  do so, but that  they  want  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is strange that the Government, which in\r\n\r\nthe  past  have consistently ignored consultations\r\n\r\nand  disregarded the views of the Opposition,  now\r\n\r\ncome  to  this House and ask us to decide what  we\r\n\r\nwant to do with the blank votes. Incidentally, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  even  when the counting started  in  the\r\n\r\nBadminton Stadium, until the very last moment, the\r\n\r\ndecision  to count the blank votes was not  taken.\r\n\r\nThe  decision  to count the blank votes  was  only\r\n\r\ntaken  at  the last moment after experts like  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance had made a careful assessment\r\n\r\nand  knew  beyond doubt that if they  counted  the\r\n\r\nblank votes the number would not exceed the number\r\n\r\nof A votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, they come here - having declared the\r\n\r\nresults  showing 71 per cent in favour of A - asking\r\n\r\nus  to  decide  what we should do with  the  blank\r\n\r\nvotes.  I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  if  the\r\n\r\ndeclared results had been 71 per cent blank votes,\r\n\r\nthe  Government would not have come here and asked\r\n\r\nus  to  decide what we should do with these  blank\r\n\r\nvotes.  In  the first place, they would  not  have\r\n\r\ncounted  the blank votes separately under  section\r\n\r\n29  of the Ordinance. They would have counted  the\r\n\r\nblank  votes together with the votes  for  A,  and\r\n\r\ndeclared only the results in respect of A.  B,  C,\r\n\r\nand the rejected votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis is grateful\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government have convened  this  sitting\r\n\r\nbecause whatever is the outcome of this sitting it\r\n\r\nwill  afford  the  Opposition the  opportunity  of\r\n\r\nrecording our views officially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have said in the past, long before the\r\n\r\n1st  of  September, long before the voting on  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  took  place,  that  we  regarded   the\r\n\r\nreferendum  as  a  sham  referendum.  It  will  be\r\n\r\nremembered, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the course of the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the  Referendum Bill that  practically\r\n\r\nevery  speaker  from the Barisan Sosialis  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly   spoke  against  the  Referendum   Bill.\r\n\r\nPractically  every speaker said that a  referendum\r\n\r\nheld  under the provisions of that Bill would  not\r\n\r\nenable  the Government to ascertain correctly  the\r\n\r\nviews of the people. We said in the past that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  was  a  sham.  We  say  now  that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  was  a  sham. A  dishonest  Referendum\r\n\r\nOrdinance  deliberately  tailored  to   give   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  a favourable result cannot produce  an\r\n\r\nhonest  and  decent referendum. We said  that  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Ordinance was a sham; we said that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  itself was a sham.  We  say  that  the\r\n\r\nresult produced as a result of this referendum was\r\n\r\nequally a sham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we notice that the Prime Minister has been\r\n\r\nvery  careful in pointing out that the  result  of\r\n\r\nthe referendum does not mean a Party victory. But,\r\n\r\nSir, lest there be in the future the temptation to\r\n\r\nregard this 71 per cent as votes for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   Government.  I  wish  to  say  that  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  want to regard this as a  victory  for\r\n\r\nthem,  I say it is a victory for intimidation.  It\r\n\r\nis a victory for deceit and dishonesty. In that we\r\n\r\nconcede that we in the Barisan Sosialis have  been\r\n\r\ndefeated. Unlike the P.A.P., we do not attempt  to\r\n\r\ndeceive  the  people  for  temporary  gains.   Our\r\n\r\nstruggle  is  a  long-term  struggle.  We  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve that the use of the police and the  radio,\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  the  Press  and  other  intimidating\r\n\r\ntactics purely for the purpose of making temporary\r\n\r\ngains  will  make any difference in  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nstruggle of all socialists for a better tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of the result has already been\r\n\r\npointed  out  by  the Member for  Queenstown.  The\r\n\r\npolitical  situation arising  from  this,  to  our\r\n\r\nminds,  appears to be unchanged as it  was  before\r\n\r\nthe 1st of September. A vote recorded in favour of\r\n\r\nAlternative  A  cannot be said to  be  a  vote  in\r\n\r\nfavour of the P.A.P., the S.P.A. or any other Party.\r\n\r\nThe  voting was not on the basis of pro one  Party\r\n\r\nor anti another Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are asked to decide on the blank votes.\r\n\r\nWe  say that blank votes are blank votes; unmarked\r\n\r\nvotes are unmarked votes; and they cannot be taken\r\n\r\nto be in support of any of the three alternatives.\r\n\r\nWe  said during the session on the Referendum Bill\r\n\r\nthat  we  were opposed to counting blank votes  as\r\n\r\nvotes  for  any of the propositions. Our  position\r\n\r\nremains the same. I am a bit puzzled at the things\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member for Anson has said. On  the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  he  says  that the referendum  was  a  sham\r\n\r\nreferendum.  He says it was an unfair  referendum.\r\n\r\nTherefore, a blank vote is a blank vote in protest\r\n\r\nagainst the referendum. On the other hand, he says\r\n\r\nhe  accepts the result of the referendum. Sir, our\r\n\r\ncontention, as I have said, is very simple. If  we\r\n\r\nare  satisfied that the referendum held under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Referendum Ordinance is  a  sham\r\n\r\nreferendum,  it cannot produce a result  which  is\r\n\r\nreflective of the views of the people. It  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary for me, Mr Speaker, Sir, to go into the\r\n\r\ndetails of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntactics at the counting of the referendum, because\r\n\r\nthis  has  been  dealt  with  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say in conclusion that the Government\r\n\r\ncan  interpret the result in one of two  ways.  It\r\n\r\ncould   say  that  this  is  a  victory  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  for  the deceit, for the  dishonesty,\r\n\r\nfor  the intimidation and all that went with them.\r\n\r\nIn  that case. Mr Speaker, Sir, they will  become\r\n\r\nbolder  in the future. They will become bolder  so\r\n\r\nthat  they are firmer in their repression  of  the\r\n\r\nexpression of the people. The Prime Minister ended\r\n\r\nup  by  saying that whether we want to continue  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional or an unconstitutional  fight  will\r\n\r\ndepend  on  us. We wish to say, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat we have no intention whatsoever to indulge in\r\n\r\nanything  that  is unconstitutional.  Whether  the\r\n\r\nGovernment are going to be more repressive or  not\r\n\r\nwill depend on them. But if they wrongly interpret\r\n\r\nthe  result to mean support for their undemocratic\r\n\r\nacts in the past, then no doubt they are bound  to\r\n\r\ntake  a bolder and more repressive attitude.  Sir,\r\n\r\nyesterday one of the prominent P.A.P. leaders said\r\n\r\nthat  they will land us two blows to one. We  tell\r\n\r\nthem that we will give them three blows to two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other manner in which the result can be\r\n\r\ninterpreted by the Government is to say  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   have   scored  a   victory   in   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional fight. And we tell them, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nwe  welcome that interpretation. If the Government\r\n\r\nhonestly and sincerely feel that they have  scored\r\n\r\na  victory, then it is a victory for parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy,   then   it  is  a  victory   for   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  fight  of  the  various  political\r\n\r\nforces, and we say we are prepared to take them on\r\n\r\nat any time in the future. But the Government must\r\n\r\nmake up their minds. They cannot, on the one hand,\r\n\r\nadvocate   constitutional   means   of   political\r\n\r\nstruggle   and  at  the  same  time   indulge   in\r\n\r\nrepression  and make sure that the  Opposition  is\r\n\r\nnot given the opportunity of expressing its views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, not so long\r\n\r\nago,  there  was  an election in  the  Philippines\r\n\r\nwhere  a certain former President - Mr Garcia - lost\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelection.

Let  me  say that round about 6 o'clock,  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Barisan Sosialis were  peacefully\r\n\r\nasleep,  confident that the counting  was  honest,\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  proceeding nicely,  and  they  were\r\n\r\nsatisfied.  Not  only the representatives  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  but Mr Lim  Ching  Siong  and\r\n\r\ntheir  legal advisers. One of their legal advisers\r\n\r\nwas  always in a state of tension. He was  jumping\r\n\r\naround  from place to place. Apart from him,  they\r\n\r\nwere peacefully asleep. That is not the conduct of\r\n\r\nmen -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of elucidation,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we were just fed up with\r\n\r\nwhat   was  going  on.

He  was  not  asleep  Mr\r\n\r\nRajaratnam. And I ask the Minister perhaps to come\r\n\r\nstraightaway to the amendment, which is  what  was\r\n\r\nare  debating, and to remind him that there  is  a\r\n\r\nguillotine  motion  which  was  proposed  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had to stress\r\n\r\nthis point because a lot of play has been made  of\r\n\r\nthe fact that this referendum was dishonest or the\r\n\r\nword \"dishonest\" had been interpreted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  mean  something else. The whole procedure  was\r\n\r\nsomething that was not quite above-board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the amendment to the motion. The\r\n\r\ncontention  by the Barisan Sosialis  is  that  the\r\n\r\nhundred  thousand  odd votes were  protest  votes.\r\n\r\nThey were protest votes of varying degrees. In the\r\n\r\ncase  of  the Member for Anson, as far  as  he  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  it  was  a protest  vote  against  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which  the referendum  was  conducted.\r\n\r\nThough  he  says  he  is very satisfied  that  the\r\n\r\nmerger proposals are genuine, his Party comes  out\r\n\r\nand  says  they are phoney. He says  he  is  quite\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the results of the referendum.  His\r\n\r\nParty comes forward and says the whole thing is  a\r\n\r\nphoney  and it does not accept the result  of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum. Therefore, it is very difficult for us\r\n\r\nto  understand  whether it is a case  of  the  dog\r\n\r\nwagging the tail or the tail wagging the dog. Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am  inclined to half agree with the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson   as  the  Member  for  Anson,  and  totally\r\n\r\ndisagree with the Member for Anson in so far as he\r\n\r\nis  a  member of the Workers' Party. I think  that\r\n\r\nmore   or   less  defines  the  quality   of   our\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come to the question of the blank votes.\r\n\r\nI did say, I think in this Assembly, that the pro-Communists  in the Barisan Sosialis  have  made  a\r\n\r\nblunder,  one  of  the biggest  blunders  for  the\r\n\r\nsecond  time, in pinning their hopes on the  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  to  indicate the measure of  the  Communist\r\n\r\ninfluence in Singapore. That is what they did.  By\r\n\r\nasking  people to come out and put blank votes  as\r\n\r\nprotest votes, they were doing something which the\r\n\r\nCommunists  have always avoided. They have  always\r\n\r\nfought elections never on their own strength,  but\r\n\r\nas  part  of  a united front. If the united  front\r\n\r\nwins, they say it is due to \"our strength\". If  it\r\n\r\nloses, then they blame the weaklings, the waverers\r\n\r\nand other people who are part of the united front.\r\n\r\nThat has now been endorsed in the latest issue  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malaya,: Monitor, which is the mouthpiece  of\r\n\r\nthe  Communist International, in so  far  as  they\r\n\r\ngive  directives to the Communists here. They have\r\n\r\ncome out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause of those who blundered by asking for  the\r\n\r\nblank  votes now. As in the case of Stalin,  when\r\n\r\nhe  made  a blunder, his bones were removed  from\r\n\r\nthe  Kremlin  and buried elsewhere. I  am  afraid\r\n\r\nthat  a  lot of the sergeant majors who conducted\r\n\r\nthis  campaign for the Communist Party are  going\r\n\r\nto  have their bones disinterred from within  the\r\n\r\nKremlin  walls and buried outside.  The  Malayan\r\n\r\nMonitor  has come out and branded them  as  shaky\r\n\r\nand confused elements who did the wrong thing  by\r\n\r\ncampaigning  for  blank  votes  and,   therefore,\r\n\r\nputting  the M.C.P. in the predicament  of  being\r\n\r\nexposed  as  a  Party which has  not  the  masses\r\n\r\nbehind  it. Today we know that the united  front,\r\n\r\nnot  only with the Barisan or the Communist Party\r\n\r\nRa'ayat,  but  even with the Liberal  Socialists,\r\n\r\nthe U.D.P., the U.P.P., the Workers' Party, could\r\n\r\nonly summon 25 per cent. To that extent, the myth\r\n\r\nthat  the Communists have the masses behind  them\r\n\r\nhas   been   exposed.  The   latest   issue,   in\r\n\r\nanticipating this, brands these people  as  shaky\r\n\r\nand  confused elements who should not  have  done\r\n\r\nthis. In fact, it goes on to say in so many words\r\n\r\nthat  all  these  people are campaigning  because\r\n\r\nthey  say, \"Well, we want to preserve citizenship\r\n\r\nand  electoral rights.\" The Malayan Monitor says,\r\n\r\ndo  not  worry  about electoral  rights.  If  the\r\n\r\npeople must lose their citizenship, let it be so;\r\n\r\ndo  not  pay  heed  to what they  call  \"colonial\r\n\r\nlegality\".  So the indications are that  if  they\r\n\r\nlose  the  constitutional struggle, after  having\r\n\r\ndiscovered their electoral stand is not all  that\r\n\r\nbig,    they    might   have   to    resort    to\r\n\r\nunconstitutional methods, and we know that during\r\n\r\nthe  campaign hints about this have been  thrown.\r\n\r\nLim  Ching Siong said so; top men have to  resort\r\n\r\nto  other means. There have been threats  by  Mr\r\n\r\nLim Ching Siong against certain Chinese community\r\n\r\nleaders  who  came  out  openly  in  support   of\r\n\r\nAlternative  A. He said the Chinese  people  will\r\n\r\nknow  how to deal with such leaders. In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nheard the same people say, \"Here is a Party which\r\n\r\nis   not   yet   in  power  already  talking   of\r\n\r\nliquidating and murdering\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  even before they are in power. What  will\r\n\r\nhappen if ever they are in power?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons we can tell them why 71 per\r\n\r\ncent of the people came and voted is not because,\r\n\r\nas  they  have said, the people were deluded  and\r\n\r\nfrightened.  The Member for Queenstown  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  we swooped ballot papers with crosses which\r\n\r\nwere  shaky. The people were not shaky,  Sir, It\r\n\r\nwas the Barisan Sosialis who were shaky that day.\r\n\r\nThese  same  people  told me once  upon  a  time,\r\n\r\nbefore  this  exposure on the 1st  of  September,\r\n\r\n\"The  people's eyes are crystal clear;  you  must\r\n\r\ntrust the people.\" Today they are telling us that\r\n\r\nthe  people  are half-blind. The same people  who\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Trust  the people. Their eyes are  clear,\"\r\n\r\nnow  say  71  per  cent of the people  have  been\r\n\r\ndeluded  and  frightened by radio propaganda,  by\r\n\r\nintimidation.  I  can tell why the  crosses  were\r\n\r\nshaky.  Some  of the people were very  old.  They\r\n\r\nwere  holding  the  pencil and trembling  in  any\r\n\r\ncase.  Not because of our propaganda, but because\r\n\r\nthey  were old. As you know, Sir, for people  who\r\n\r\nare  frightened, they say we are using the radio.\r\n\r\nIf  they  really  believe that we were  spreading\r\n\r\nfalsehoods and misleading the people, we  offered\r\n\r\nthem  time  over the radio. Come and  expose  us.\r\n\r\nWhen  the P.A.P. says this and that, it is all  a\r\n\r\nlie.  We asked them to come. The Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim,  after  the  first forum, turned  round  and\r\n\r\nsaid, \"I am fed up. It is a waste of time.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  coming.\"  The second forum, the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  said,  \"No, I am  not  coming.\"  The\r\n\r\nthird  one - I must say the Member for  Anson  came\r\n\r\nfor  two of them, and one special interview where\r\n\r\nI  thought  he  was the most reasonable  man.  In\r\n\r\nfact,   our  relationship  was  almost   cordial,\r\n\r\nfriendly.  Now he sees me, he looks  through  me.\r\n\r\nBut I will say this much for him. At least he  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to argue. Sometimes he says  the  wrong\r\n\r\nthings  at  lunchtime  rallies,  but  that  is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent   proposition.  But  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown?  Here  they  keep  on  saying   Radio\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  suppression of the voice of the  people.\r\n\r\nWe  say,  \"All  right, please come along.  Expose\r\n\r\nus.\" One\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  points which I think should be  made  is\r\n\r\nthat  they are afraid of the open encounter.  One\r\n\r\nof the reasons why they have lost heavily is that\r\n\r\nfar  from suppressing them, we have allowed  them\r\n\r\nto  have  their say. Every time they  open  their\r\n\r\nmouths   in  public,  their  falsehoods  can   be\r\n\r\nchallenged, and they lose out. That is  why  they\r\n\r\ndo not want to. As you know, they cut Rediffusion\r\n\r\nwires. Why? People who believe in free speech  go\r\n\r\naround  cutting  Rediffusion  wires.  People  who\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  free  speech put on loudspeakers  to\r\n\r\ndisturb other people's meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Shame, shame!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> We have made it quite clear,\r\n\r\nSir. This is not a P.A.P. victory. The first time\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  be  proved between  the  democratic\r\n\r\nelements,   the  Malayan  elements,   the   loyal\r\n\r\nelements  and the party of people who  have  been\r\n\r\nexposed  as  a negligible force. If  we  were  to\r\n\r\ndecide on the 25 per cent, I would say give  half\r\n\r\nto  the Member for Anson, the Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nand  to  Mrs Leon-Soh. The other half are people\r\n\r\nwhom  you  have misled. Of the remaining  12  per\r\n\r\ncent,  I would say 5 per cent are the hard  core.\r\n\r\nWhether  the Member for Queenstown and  everybody\r\n\r\nlikes it or not, obviously a new directive is  to\r\n\r\ncome - tough  methods.  If  the  leaders   of   the\r\n\r\nrevolution  want to fight it in a  tough  way,  I\r\n\r\nhope the Member for Queenstown - I am told he is a\r\n\r\ngood  rugby player, a good chess player and I  am\r\n\r\nalso told he is a good gambler, but one thing  we\r\n\r\nknow, he is a bad loser. Whatever it is, to be  a\r\n\r\ngood revolutionary in the new phase, in 1947  and\r\n\r\n1948  when the Communist Party took arms, it  was\r\n\r\nan  anti-colonial struggle. Now, if you  take  up\r\n\r\narms,  you are definitely going to meet  with  71\r\n\r\nper  cent of the people, and I am quite sure  the\r\n\r\n25  per  cent who voted blank votes  - that  is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent thing - but they are not going  to  vote\r\n\r\nfor   violent   revolution.  If   the   Communist\r\n\r\ndirective  comes  for  the  Barisan  Sosialis  to\r\n\r\nresort  to direct action, the Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nalready  warned that there will be direct  action\r\n\r\non the part of the Government,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  because  we are the Government, but  because\r\n\r\nthe  71  per cent of the people have given  us  a\r\n\r\nmandate  to  see  merger through.  If the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis or their fellow travellers stand in  the\r\n\r\nway  under the directive of gentlemen who are not\r\n\r\ngoing to come back to the Assembly - it is all very\r\n\r\nwell  for  Lim  Hong Bee to give  directives  for\r\n\r\ndirect  action; he is not going to have his  head\r\n\r\nbroken; but he will obviously give a directive to\r\n\r\nlots  of gentlemen who do not know what they  are\r\n\r\nup to - let us give this warning, that we are ready\r\n\r\nfor  them.  If they really want to  play  it  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional way, then let them,  at  least  in\r\n\r\ntheir  own  minds, whatever they might say  here,\r\n\r\naccept  the fact that this is the verdict of  the\r\n\r\npeople, not of the P.A.P., not of the S.P.A., not\r\n\r\nof  U.M.N.O.  The verdict of 71 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nelectorate,  who were not deluded or  cheated  or\r\n\r\nanything. They are intelligent people.  They  are\r\n\r\nnot  all  that  foolish. As the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave  said, the people's eyes are crystal  clear.\r\n\r\nLet them remember that. The people knew what they\r\n\r\nwere  doing  and  they voted  for  Alternative  A\r\n\r\nbecause they believed that was the best. In fact,\r\n\r\nI  think during the last few months the behaviour\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis made it quite clear  to\r\n\r\nthe ordinary people who were fed up with its half-dead revolutionaries, sergeant majors who did not\r\n\r\nknow what they were up to. These people were  not\r\n\r\ninterested  in  giving  constructive  leadership.\r\n\r\nThey  were out to destroy. In one year they  have\r\n\r\nshown  they know nothing but only to destroy  and\r\n\r\ncreate trouble. The ordinary man is not all  that\r\n\r\nfoolish. He walks around Raffles Place.  He  sees\r\n\r\nthese  gentlemen  going  around  putting  burning\r\n\r\ncigarettes on the backs of people's necks.  These\r\n\r\nare  things which people are not blind to. People\r\n\r\nwho  want to leave the Party pinch every  bit  of\r\n\r\nfurniture - cups, broken kettles.

It  was\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis which fled and ran away from\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped\r\n\r\nthat  when the Assembly finished its sitting last\r\n\r\nJuly,  we would have some peace of mind and  that\r\n\r\nwe  would not have to come to the Assembly for  a\r\n\r\nlong,   long  time  to  hear  political  comrades\r\n\r\ntearing one another to pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, so far all the speeches made this\r\n\r\nafternoon,  apart  from the Member  for  Anson's,\r\n\r\nwere  speeches made by Members belonging  to  one\r\n\r\npolitical Party sitting on one side of the  House\r\n\r\nwhen   they  were  returned  to  power.  At  that\r\n\r\nparticular  time  all  the  activities  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. indulged in, such as the P.A.P. radio, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. newspaper,  suppression  of  newspapers.\r\n\r\nintimidation of the people, all those  activities\r\n\r\nwere  indulged in by everyone of them.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nwhen  all of them were there, they said, \"We  are\r\n\r\ngood,  clean and honest,\" when everyone  of  them\r\n\r\nwas  dishonest it seems funny that for the  whole\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis afternoon Party comrades are now calling  one\r\n\r\nanother dishonest. Sir, from their claim of  being\r\n\r\nclean,   honest   and  good,  they   have   become\r\n\r\ndishonest, unclean and very bad. So much  so  that\r\n\r\neach side is trying to destroy the other. In fact,\r\n\r\nthe  word \"sham\" has been used many times by  both\r\n\r\nsides  of the P.A.P - I still call them \"both  sides\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it a sham fight between both sides of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to get out of their responsibility for\r\n\r\nthe  mess  that they have left to the  country?  I\r\n\r\nhope  not. But if it is a fight between democratic\r\n\r\nforces  and  Communist forces in the camp  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  let  it  be  a fight  that  will  give  a\r\n\r\ndecisive  answer.  Sir, we do  not  like  to  hear\r\n\r\nMinisters,  in  particular  the  Prime   Minister,\r\n\r\nsaying, as just now the Minister for Culture stood\r\n\r\nup and said, \"Ah, we now have 71 per cent. Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  you  watch out! If you  want  to  fight\r\n\r\nconstitutionally,    we     will     fight     you\r\n\r\nconstitutionally.   If   you   want    to    fight\r\n\r\nunconstitutionally,    we    will    fight     you\r\n\r\nunconstitutionally.\" That is not the way to  utter\r\n\r\nthat  kind of warning. If the Government  honestly\r\n\r\nbelieves  that the Barisan Sosialis are controlled\r\n\r\nby  the  Communists, then the Government  has  one\r\n\r\nduty  to  perform.  There  is  no  need  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to stand here and utter a warning,  so\r\n\r\nmuch  so  that  it  makes me feel  that  all  this\r\n\r\nwarning  from either side of the House is becoming\r\n\r\na  sham. Let there be action. 71 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  given  their verdict  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nmerger; 71 per cent of those who voted are for  A.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the duty, not only of the Government but\r\n\r\nalso of this Assembly, to see that the decision of\r\n\r\nthe  electorate is carried out despite any attempt\r\n\r\nthat the Communists and their stooges may wish  to\r\n\r\nemploy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems that this party warfare between ex-comrades is to continue for some more months to\r\n\r\ncome. It may carry on right up to the next general\r\n\r\nelections.  During the referendum, when referendum\r\n\r\nmeetings  were  held  by the P.A.P.,  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, and the U.P.P., what they did  was  not\r\n\r\nto tell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people  or to explain to them  the  forms  of\r\n\r\nmerger  that were open to them, or to advise  them\r\n\r\nto  choose what they felt was the better  form  of\r\n\r\nmerger for the people of Singapore. No. They  made\r\n\r\nuse  of  the referendum meetings just to carry  on\r\n\r\ntheir  political  fight.  There  was  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis calling the P.A.P. cheats, and all  sorts\r\n\r\nof  things.  And there was the P.A.P. calling  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Communists. That was not the  way\r\n\r\nto get the people to come to a proper appreciation\r\n\r\nof  the  forms  of merger that were posed  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum. The people have voted. A decision  has\r\n\r\nbeen reached. It should not therefore be necessary\r\n\r\nfor  this party warfare to continue again in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  this  afternoon. By the very terms  of  the\r\n\r\nmotion, it would seem that the P.A.P. want to have\r\n\r\none  at the Barisan Sosialis, and by the amendment\r\n\r\nproposed  by the Barisan Sosialis, it  seems  that\r\n\r\nthey  want to have one at the P.A.P. What  is  all\r\n\r\nthis about?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why cannot uncertain votes remain uncertain? Why\r\n\r\ncannot blank votes remain blank? Why must it again\r\n\r\nbe the focal point of warfare between comrades who\r\n\r\nhave fallen out? Let uncertain votes be uncertain.\r\n\r\nLet  blank  votes be blank, because they  have  no\r\n\r\neffect whatsoever on those known votes of A, B, or\r\n\r\nC.  If  they have an effect on the result  of  the\r\n\r\nvoting, whether it should be A, B or C, then  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  should be called upon to decide  in  the\r\n\r\nmost  honest  manner what those blank  votes  were\r\n\r\nmeant to mean. But now there is no need for us  to\r\n\r\ngive it an interpretation and say blank votes were\r\n\r\nthe  Communists  who were trying their  best  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  those  were  the  25  per   cent   the\r\n\r\nCommunists could muster. We should not try to give\r\n\r\nan  interpretation in that way, because out of the\r\n\r\n25  per  cent  who put in blank votes,  there  was\r\n\r\nstill  a large number of people who would  at  any\r\n\r\nprice  vote out the P.A.P., out of hatred and  out\r\n\r\nof  anger, and not because they were misled by the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Of course, there are some  there  who\r\n\r\nwere  misled by the Communists. I do not know  how\r\n\r\nmany  per cent. Let us not give an interpretation.\r\n\r\nLet  the  Barisan Sosialis not try to  claim  that\r\n\r\nthese were protest votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Why did you not speak up in\r\n\r\nthe debate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I only hope that the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown could just walk to the other\r\n\r\nside and face me.

There need not be a sham fight,\r\n\r\none  side  calling the other Communists,  and  the\r\n\r\nother  side  calling  the  other  side  dishonest,\r\n\r\nwhereas both of them are dishonest. If there  were\r\n\r\nCommunists,  then both of them had  been  sleeping\r\n\r\nwith  the Communists for three years. Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\ntrue,  as  has been brought out by the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, wild rumours were going on, and a  lot\r\n\r\nof  people  were misled into believing that  those\r\n\r\nwho  cast blank votes would have their citizenship\r\n\r\npapers  taken away. The Member for Queenstown,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, wanted the Government to give an assurance\r\n\r\nthat  such things should not happen. But  we  know\r\n\r\nquite  well  that that cannot happen.  But  if  it\r\n\r\nwould  make  the  Member for  Queenstown  happier,\r\n\r\nsince  obviously he had put in a blank  vote,  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  or a Minister of  the  Government\r\n\r\ncould  assure him that, in spite of the fact  that\r\n\r\nhe had put in a blank vote, without even having to\r\n\r\ngo   through  the  number  on  the  back  of   the\r\n\r\ncounterfoil  of the ballot paper, his  citizenship\r\n\r\nwould  not  be taken away, unless, of  course,  he\r\n\r\ntries  to  be funny and plays the unconstitutional\r\n\r\nline in this political arena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> What are you preaching,\r\n\r\nsomersaulter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, there is no need for the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown to say that the trump  card\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. was this, the trump  card  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was that.

The fight  started  some  14\r\n\r\nmonths ago. Since then, the anti-nationalist  Left\r\n\r\nthrew  everything  they had  into  the  battle  to\r\n\r\nfrustrate merger and Malaysia. We know that on the\r\n\r\n1st  of  September,  they  suffered  a  disastrous\r\n\r\ntrouncing.  As  one newspaper had  it,  they  were\r\n\r\nwhipped.  They  were hit for six  on  the  1st  of\r\n\r\nSeptember.  With  all their propaganda  apparatus,\r\n\r\nthrough  their mass organisations which  they  had\r\n\r\ndisciplined and in command, they could not  muster\r\n\r\nmore  than  a  quarter  of  the  support  of   the\r\n\r\nelectorate. Even of the 144,000 persons whom  they\r\n\r\nhad  persuaded to cast blank votes, only a portion\r\n\r\nwere   real   supporters.  We,   who   have   been\r\n\r\ncampaigning  on  the ground, came across  numerous\r\n\r\ninstances  where  people welcomed  us  into  their\r\n\r\nhomes  and  said,  \"Yes, we are going  to  support\r\n\r\nAlternative A. We are going to cast blank  votes.\"\r\n\r\nSo  we asked them, \"Who told you that?\" They said,\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Barisan Sosialis says the P.A.P. is  a\r\n\r\ngood Party. If you want to support the Government,\r\n\r\nyou   cast  a  blank  vote.\"  Therefore,  on   1st\r\n\r\nSeptember, the real strength they could muster  in\r\n\r\nthe   constitutional  fight  was  revealed.  Their\r\n\r\npretensions to being an invincible political force\r\n\r\nwere  shattered once and for all. As my colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Culture, has pointed out, it has\r\n\r\nalways  been  their slogan that the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople are crystal clear - clear and bright as snow.\r\n\r\nNow  faced with this clear verdict of the  people,\r\n\r\nhow  did these half-baked revolutionaries  of  the\r\n\r\nanti-nationalist  Left  behave?  Was   there   any\r\n\r\ndignity in their acceptance of the verdict of  the\r\n\r\npeople? Did they search\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  hearts  as to where they went  wrong?  No,\r\n\r\nSir.   Their  behaviour  reminded  me  of   little\r\n\r\nschoolboys.  You will remember, Sir, perhaps  when\r\n\r\nwe  were very young, perhaps in Standard I, II  or\r\n\r\nIII, we came across the spoiled child who, when he\r\n\r\ngot  the worst of any encounter, would scream out,\r\n\r\n\"Teacher, he beat me.\" Or, \"Sir, unfair.\" This  is\r\n\r\nthe  way these people who claim to be adults,  who\r\n\r\nclaim  to  be leaders of the people, who claim  to\r\n\r\nrepresent the electorate in this Assembly, behave.\r\n\r\nWhen  they  get  the worse of the encounter,  they\r\n\r\nbehave  just  like little schoolboys, like  spoilt\r\n\r\nchildren.

I say I  do  not  place  much\r\n\r\nimportance on what the Member for Queenstown says.\r\n\r\nHe  is  a  very  minor operator in the  scheme  of\r\n\r\nthings.  These are not only minor but  ineffective\r\n\r\nopen  front  operators and bring disgrace  to  the\r\n\r\ncause.  But may I say the real meaning of this  is\r\n\r\nthat, for the first time, the Communists and their\r\n\r\nopen  front organisations have been outmanoeuvred,\r\n\r\noutwitted, trapped and massacred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us see what happened in 1955 and 1958. In\r\n\r\n1955, the first Chief Minister was there. Much  to\r\n\r\nhis  surprise, he won the elections and  within  a\r\n\r\nfew  months  they opened fire on him  and  he  ran\r\n\r\naround  like  a half-witted chicken,  not  knowing\r\n\r\nwhether  he  was standing on his feet  or  on  his\r\n\r\nheels  or  on  his  head. Now,  the  second  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  was made of sterner stuff. That  I  give\r\n\r\nhim credit for. He tried to put up a fight, but it\r\n\r\nwas an unequal struggle, between a green belt judo\r\n\r\nman  and  a rookie. The rookie came along and  was\r\n\r\nthrown  down,  in the end, dazed and prostrate  on\r\n\r\nthe  floor. The green belt judo man takes  us  on,\r\n\r\nbut  we  have  been schooled in this revolutionary\r\n\r\nstruggle  and we have good men who know  the  real\r\n\r\nmeaning,  who  can read the signs. So  this  green\r\n\r\nbelt judo man meets a black belt judo man and,  on\r\n\r\nthe  1st  of September, he was there, groaning  in\r\n\r\nagony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> No belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What is the use of pretending\r\n\r\nthat  the referendum is a sham, that, in fact,  it\r\n\r\nwas  not  a defeat, that, in fact, the people  did\r\n\r\nnot  want merger and Malaysia?

The  law  says  any  uncertain  or\r\n\r\nunmarked  vote  shall be that of a person  who  is\r\n\r\ndeemed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccept or is willing to accept the decision of the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  and  the decision of the  Assembly  was\r\n\r\nthat  it  shall either be A, B or C, not  that  it\r\n\r\nshall be nothing at all. That was the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly.  I therefore say, as a  preliminary\r\n\r\nsubmission  ex  abundante cautela, nothing  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  delegatus  non  potest  delegare  that  this\r\n\r\namendment is contrary to the provisions of section\r\n\r\n29,  read  in conjunction with the motion  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  which  said  that the  people  shall  be\r\n\r\ncalled upon to decide whether it is A or B  or  C.\r\n\r\nHowever, since you have allowed the debate  to  go\r\n\r\non  to this stage, I shall not press my point, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think the more interesting aspect of\r\n\r\nthis  debate  was the very fortuitous intervention\r\n\r\nof the Member for Anson. I am grateful to him from\r\n\r\ntime  to time. He is not quite sure, when the line\r\n\r\nwas drawn, which side of the line he was on. It is\r\n\r\nlike   Schleswig-Holstein,  sometimes  this  side,\r\n\r\nDenmark,  sometimes the other side. From  time  to\r\n\r\ntime he battles forth. Or like Stalingrad, an even\r\n\r\nmore  vivid  example of how the battle  line  went\r\n\r\nbackwards  and  forwards. In the end,  of  course,\r\n\r\nStalingrad was reduced to rubble. But the Russians\r\n\r\nwere made of sterner stuff and they rebuilt it.  I\r\n\r\nhope  with  the help of all the modern methods  of\r\n\r\npsychotherapy a new person can be rebuilt  out  of\r\n\r\nall this tremendous battle for minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson decided\r\n\r\nsometime  in  the  course of this  debate  at  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Singapore forum that he would  play\r\n\r\nthe line of the reasonable man, just willing to be\r\n\r\nfair,  willing  to see the other side;  and  in  a\r\n\r\nmoment  of  fervour in the argument,  he  went  on\r\n\r\nwithout  the  permission of his Central  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee to say that 15 representatives was fair,\r\n\r\nacceptable-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nThe   point   of   order   is   misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nMisrepresentation  in  that  anything  I  said  in\r\n\r\nconnection  with the acceptance of the 15  members\r\n\r\nwas  not  with  the  permission  of  my  Executive\r\n\r\nCouncil-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The Member for Anson was not responsible.\r\n\r\nObviously  the  artist who did that had  sabotaged\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Executive Committee of the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty.  However, what was interesting was he  said\r\n\r\nthat,  and  suddenly he came to the  side  of  the\r\n\r\nreasonable  man.  Then  in  the  course   of   the\r\n\r\ndenouement  during the last few  weeks,  bits  and\r\n\r\npieces  were falling into place. He found  himself\r\n\r\nthe victim of his own reasonableness. Logically he\r\n\r\nmoved step by step into a position where he had to\r\n\r\nsay  he  supported the White Paper, as amended.  I\r\n\r\nsay  he  was an honourable man in saying that.  He\r\n\r\nwent  far to try and honour his word, to  get  his\r\n\r\nCommittee to agree. Well, the Committee either did\r\n\r\nnot  agree  or  he  did not try  hard  enough.  An\r\n\r\nimpasse was reached. He said, \"Yes, support it. It\r\n\r\nis  fair  and just. However, cast blank  ballots.\"\r\n\r\nBeing a lawyer of no mean repute, the whole matter\r\n\r\nwas  rationalised after the 18th of August. On the\r\n\r\n18th of August he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  he was going to ask his Committee to support\r\n\r\nit.  Revise  this  blank ballot  thing.  The  same\r\n\r\nrationalisation Ex post facto - that  is  another\r\n\r\nLatin  tag.  It means after the event.  After  the\r\n\r\nfailure, an explanation is put on. The White Paper\r\n\r\npassword\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis   right,  but  the  referendum  is  not  right.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I accept that. Now I say I was wrong  in\r\n\r\nsaying that all those who voted against the  White\r\n\r\nPaper,  who  cast protest votes,  intended  to  be\r\n\r\nagainst  merger. In fact, we are sure  now,  after\r\n\r\nthe  very frank and honest admission of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson,  that there is at least  one  unmarked\r\n\r\nballot  paper  that was in favour of merger.  That\r\n\r\nwas  the Member for Anson, Mr Speaker, Sir. There\r\n\r\nmay be more. You will have to use psychotherapy on\r\n\r\nthe 144,077 - I beg your pardon, we have already\r\n\r\nexplained  away one; it is 144,076. The others  we\r\n\r\ncan  go  through  one by one and discover  whether\r\n\r\nthey were like the Member for Anson, or the Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown, or the Member for Hong Lim. I mean\r\n\r\nthere  are gradations in all these things.  But  I\r\n\r\nthought  he did us the greatest service  today.  I\r\n\r\ndid  not want to say this in my opening because  I\r\n\r\nthought  if it came from the other side,  so  much\r\n\r\nthe  more effective would it be. All this villainy\r\n\r\nthat   is   now   heaped   upon   us - of   threats,\r\n\r\nintimidation, rigging - we could have answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a referendum petition provision put in\r\n\r\nby  the  Member  for Anson which  provides  for  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  re-scrutiny  of the  whole  process,  of\r\n\r\nevery  iota  of  evidence  being  put  under   the\r\n\r\nmicroscope.  But having come from me,  they  would\r\n\r\nhave  said, \"Ah, that is what the Government says.\r\n\r\nThe  Government will fix the witnesses, intimidate\r\n\r\nthem.  The  police  will threaten  the  Referendum\r\n\r\nJudge.\" All kinds of other allegations will  come.\r\n\r\nI thank the Member for Anson. He did the country a\r\n\r\nservice.  He  shot the ball into the Barisan  goal\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said  that. But if they  believe  it  is\r\n\r\ndishonest,  it  is  their  duty  to  bring  up   a\r\n\r\nreferendum  petition and let  us  go  through  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of it. Let us find out who intimidate whom.\r\n\r\nLet him listen tonight to Radio Singapore and hear\r\n\r\nwhat the Chamber of Commerce said to me, their own\r\n\r\nvoices  on  the tape, in Hokkien and in  Mandarin;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  the Barisan said in their rallies. They  who\r\n\r\nwere  genuinely intimidated, ching  suan.  \"ching\"\r\n\r\nmeans  clear, \"suan\" means count. That  means  the\r\n\r\nsettling  of accounts. \"We will settle with  you.\"\r\n\r\nThat  is  what it means, ching suan. And they  are\r\n\r\nmen who took it seriously. They came and discussed\r\n\r\nthe  matter with me this morning. I told them that\r\n\r\nas  long as we the Government of Singapore and  as\r\n\r\nlong  as there is an honest Government here, there\r\n\r\nwill  be  no ching suan according to the rules  of\r\n\r\nthe  game. If anybody is in danger of being  ching\r\n\r\nsuan-ed, well, let them listen to what was said by\r\n\r\nthe    Chamber    of    Commerce.   [Interruption]\r\n\r\nIntimidation?  Let  them  bring  up  a  referendum\r\n\r\npetition  and  we will prove it. All the  threats,\r\n\r\nall  the  smears, all the vilifications,  all  the\r\n\r\nlies.  Let me explain to the Member for Anson  why\r\n\r\nwe  did not do things the simple direct way. He is\r\n\r\nnot   an  unintelligent  man.  In  fact,  I   once\r\n\r\nremembered  Lord Lennox-Boyd, the former  Colonial\r\n\r\nSecretary, paid him a tribute, that he was a  very\r\n\r\nintelligent Chief Minister; a great tribute from a\r\n\r\nvery    intelligent    man.   Lord    Lennox-Boyd,\r\n\r\nundoubtedly   a  man  of  tremendous  intellectual\r\n\r\ncapacity, paid a tribute to the ex-Chief Minister,\r\n\r\nthat  he  was  an  intelligent man.  Now,  I  say,\r\n\r\nexercise a little bit of that intelligence in this\r\n\r\nrespect.  Why  did we not say honestly,  \"Yes,  we\r\n\r\nwill  count the blank votes\"? Why did we not  give\r\n\r\nnotice  last  week that we were going  to  hold  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  this  week?  Let us  all  be  simple  and\r\n\r\nstraightforward.  Sir, I do not usually  think  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  pictures because it so happens  that  I\r\n\r\nlike  to be more precise, if somewhat less  vivid,\r\n\r\nin  my  forms  of  thought. But my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, once said that  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson from time to time behaves as if he is  a\r\n\r\nvestal  virgin who wanders through a brothel  area\r\n\r\ncrying out for the brotherhood and freedom of  men\r\n\r\nand  women. And I say to him, as a result of  that\r\n\r\nfoolish exercise in human decency, he wound  up  a\r\n\r\npolitical whore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, Mr Speaker, Sir. Mr Woodhull\r\n\r\nwas  dead  right - 1956,  a famous  occasion.  I  am\r\n\r\ngrateful to the Member for Anson and I am grateful\r\n\r\nto the Member for Cairnhill. They paid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  the lessons from which I profited. I say that\r\n\r\nwithout any reservation and with no malice. I  say\r\n\r\nif  it  had  been  my misfortune to  become  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  in 1955, I think I would have  perished.\r\n\r\nAnd I say that sincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the Member for Anson hold out his hand in\r\n\r\nfriendship to Mr Lim Ching Siong. Thirteen of  us\r\n\r\nwent to London and Mr Lim Ching Siong pumped  his\r\n\r\nhand vigorously and told him to fight for absolute\r\n\r\nindependence. The Member was a reasonable man.  He\r\n\r\nwanted to fight for absolute independence and give\r\n\r\nback  defence  and external affairs under  treaty.\r\n\r\nThen  he could still go to the United Nations,  an\r\n\r\nambition now fulfilled. Yet Lord Lennox-Boyd would\r\n\r\nget  what he wanted. So both sides were happy.  He\r\n\r\nis always trying to be the reasonable broker, find\r\n\r\na  happy  mean  and settle. He did not  understand\r\n\r\nthat   young  master  Lim  had  no  intention   of\r\n\r\nsettling.  He  was just egging him on,  and  every\r\n\r\ntime it looked like reaching a settlement, he  was\r\n\r\npushed  a little hit further; the same tactics  as\r\n\r\nused  by the Member for Queenstown. I mean  he  is\r\n\r\nsurely  not that naive. The Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nsays  merger is a complete merger, twelve  States,\r\n\r\nall   Singapore  citizens  automatically   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens. The Member for Anson says, \"Agreed,  all\r\n\r\nright.  Move  Alternative  D.\"  We  rejected  that\r\n\r\nbecause the real Alternative D was what the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown meant. After that, if you say  you\r\n\r\nare,  to  that, then proportional representation.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Anson never demanded that. You will\r\n\r\nremember  the  forum? When I  said  that  was  not\r\n\r\nmentioned   in  Alternative  D,  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown   said,   no,  no,   no,   proportional\r\n\r\nrepresentation   also.  And  if   we   agreed   to\r\n\r\nproportional   representation,   then   the   next\r\n\r\ncondition - dissolve   Singapore   and    Federation\r\n\r\nGovernments; general elections all round; then see\r\n\r\nwhat turned up. And this young man pumped his hand\r\n\r\nso  hard.  The Member for Anson thought it  was  a\r\n\r\ntest  of  friendship, the grip of friendship.  The\r\n\r\nyoung  man  was  a green belt judo kan.  The  next\r\n\r\nthing he found himself on the floor, prostrate-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfallen. I did not trip him up, Mr Speaker, Sir;\r\n\r\nyoung master Lim did, young master Lim did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I saw the Member for Cairnhill. True he was\r\n\r\nmade  of sterner stuff. Yes, he was, not now.  He\r\n\r\ngot  such a pulverizing experience he never quite\r\n\r\nrecovered  from  it.  It is  like  one  of  those\r\n\r\nmincing  machines,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  You  put\r\n\r\nsomething  in and get a shake-up. At the  end  of\r\n\r\nit,  you never put the molecules together  again.\r\n\r\nHe lost all his teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, Is  this the time for bed-time stories?  We\r\n\r\nhave got only one hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas  indicated how all this is relevant;  why  he\r\n\r\nwas  (I  think the expression used was)  \"playing\r\n\r\nthe soft pedal\" before the 1st of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Not at all. I never used\r\n\r\nthat  expression, Sir. Why we did  not  have  the\r\n\r\nsimple vestal virgin approaching a brothel  area.\r\n\r\nWe  knew  we were in a brothel area and  what  we\r\n\r\ndid.  I  do not know if the Member for Anson  has\r\n\r\nread this newspaper. In some parts of an American\r\n\r\ntown,  it  seems there were lots of  women  being\r\n\r\ncoshed  very  early at night. So the police  sent\r\n\r\nout men dressed as women. The cosher came out, he\r\n\r\ngot  coshed.  Now, Sir, there were some  pictures\r\n\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to come back to the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill, he was a brave man. He came out with a\r\n\r\npoliceman's  baton  and one bayonet  looking  for\r\n\r\nthem.  Young master Lim, green belt, waited.  The\r\n\r\nnext  thing  the  Member for Cairnhill  knew  his\r\n\r\nbaton  was  parted  from  him,  the  bayonet  was\r\n\r\ndropped  from a limp and lifeless hand.  The  man\r\n\r\nkicked  in  the  groin, arms twisted;  man  lying\r\n\r\nstill  on  the floor. Inert for months and  years\r\n\r\nafterwards;  and  after recovery  not  quite  the\r\n\r\nsame.  And  I  say  I  am really  and  genuinely,\r\n\r\nwithout any malice, grateful for that experience.\r\n\r\nI saw it and I told him then, when it took place,\r\n\r\nthat  he was a brave man because he did not  know\r\n\r\nwhat he was tackling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  I saw it and I learned from it. And when the\r\n\r\ngreen  belt  rookies  came  out  with  new,  even\r\n\r\ngreener ones to assist them-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And you hit them below the\r\n\r\nbelt!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no, we consulted. That\r\n\r\nis  true. What the Member for Cairnhill  said  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely true. But for the dedication  of  some\r\n\r\nof  my  Party colleagues who knew the  Communists\r\n\r\nand  their  methods,  who  either  corrected   or\r\n\r\nconfirmed  our judgments, we may well  have  been\r\n\r\nlike  the Member for Cairnhill, prostrate on  the\r\n\r\nground,  not knowing what has hit us, but knowing\r\n\r\nwhat is going to happen. We took training from  a\r\n\r\nblack belt judo kan. When the green belts met the\r\n\r\nblack  belts - not one black  belt,  many  black\r\n\r\nbelts - that  is where the green belts  made  their\r\n\r\nfirst   error.   They  have  always,   in   their\r\n\r\nsimplicity   of   propaganda,  personalised   the\r\n\r\ndefects and the weaknesses of the Government  all\r\n\r\nin me. If the Government was as weak or as strong\r\n\r\nas   I  am,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  it  would  have\r\n\r\nperished.  My  weaknesses  are  made  up  by  the\r\n\r\nstrength  of my colleagues. Their weaknesses  are\r\n\r\nmade  up by the strength of others. So we have  a\r\n\r\nfairly   tight  strong  front  which  cannot   be\r\n\r\npierced. One fought on until death. I think Inche\r\n\r\nAhmad bin Ibrahim would have had a great deal  of\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  that night, 2nd of September;  that\r\n\r\nmorning if only he was alive, he would have found\r\n\r\nit   worthwhile  suffering  because  he  believed\r\n\r\nabsolutely and utterly in what we are  doing  and\r\n\r\nhe  was  with us. And the green belts found  that\r\n\r\nthey  were not taking an innocent young  lady  to\r\n\r\nthe  bushes to do her in and take her purse. They\r\n\r\nfound  themselves in the police  station  charge-room. That is where they are now, and you have to\r\n\r\nhave a proper legal defence, employ a good lawyer\r\n\r\nand  argue  the case out. It was a fair  cop.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we wanted to count the blank votes  from\r\n\r\nthe  very beginning. But are we so stupid  as  to\r\n\r\ntell them? Why should we tell them? That is  the\r\n\r\ntragedy of the Member for Anson. A man comes  out\r\n\r\nand  tells you the first time we moved that  Bill\r\n\r\nin  January  1962 that there was no provision  to\r\n\r\ncount blank votes as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccording  to  the decision of the Assembly.  Then\r\n\r\nthe  fellow tells you that he wants people to tear\r\n\r\nballot papers and you still go on, having received\r\n\r\nthe  first  wolf call and you know  that  you  are\r\n\r\nentering  the  danger area, you gaily  swing  your\r\n\r\nhips  and saunter through.

Then\r\n\r\nwhen  he  felt that the other side was better,  he\r\n\r\njoined  and dribbled with the other side to  shoot\r\n\r\nthe ball at our goal. But every now and again,  it\r\n\r\nwas  our  good  fortune  in  the  course  of  this\r\n\r\nreferendum, just as the ball was being placed near\r\n\r\ntheir goal post, he shot one. He did a right about\r\n\r\nturn  and  shot it into their goal. And  I  say  I\r\n\r\nthank  him for this, because if any Member on  our\r\n\r\nside had said, \"Put up a referendum petition,\"  we\r\n\r\nwould have thought it was a fixed job, but it  was\r\n\r\nnot. The Member for Anson claims credit for it. He\r\n\r\nmoved  those  provisions. I  agree - absolutely  and\r\n\r\nutterly.  He  discovered a lacuna in the  law  and\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Have a Referendum Judge,\" and  we  agreed.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we got our S.A.G. to tighten  up  and\r\n\r\nelaborate on his provision and he was good  enough\r\n\r\nto  pay  us a compliment that that was so. A  good\r\n\r\nchap, to see whether it was done according to  the\r\n\r\nrules,  and coming from him it must be so.  And  I\r\n\r\nsay  this: let him at least in the last  stage  of\r\n\r\nthis  phase  have the gumption to  turn  round  to\r\n\r\nthese gentlemen whom he knows to be Communists and\r\n\r\npro-Communists,  that they have  no  intention  of\r\n\r\nplaying  it  the  democratic  way,  they  have  no\r\n\r\nintention  of checking the democratic  process  by\r\n\r\ndemocratic methods, as he has suggested, that they\r\n\r\nare  really toughies at heart. What Dr  Lim  Hock\r\n\r\nSiew   said - he  wrote  a  letter  to  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes - after  the battle was over, he said,  \"I  do\r\n\r\nnot mean that we will resort to other means. I say\r\n\r\nthat  other  people will have to resort  to  other\r\n\r\nmeans.\" Very strange, these chaps. If other people\r\n\r\nwere to resort to other means, why encourage them?\r\n\r\nThat  is what I want to know.

P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  amendment  seeks to bring about  a  situation\r\n\r\nthat  the unmarked ballot papers be recognised  as\r\n\r\nprotest  votes, and all the unmarked and uncertain\r\n\r\nballot papers be not counted as supporting any  of\r\n\r\nthe Alternatives A, B, or C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may deal with the amendment under these\r\n\r\ntwo  heads.  First  of all, that  unmarked  ballot\r\n\r\npapers  be recognised as protest votes.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nphrase  \"protest votes\" there could mean a  number\r\n\r\nof  things.  The  Member for Anson  has  given  an\r\n\r\nindication  that  it  could  mean  protest   votes\r\n\r\nagainst   a   sham   referendum.   That   is   the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  he  seeks to  give  to  the  words\r\n\r\n\"protest  votes\".  The Barisan Sosialis  not  only\r\n\r\ngive  that interpretation but they take it further\r\n\r\nand  say  that they are protest votes because  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper is completely unacceptable  to  them.\r\n\r\nYet  again  the protest votes, from the  point  of\r\n\r\nview of the Barisan Sosialis, could mean that  the\r\n\r\nquestions  posed on the paper which  went  on  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  were  dishonest  questions - the   third\r\n\r\npossibility. The fourth possibility they have also\r\n\r\nsuggested to the House is that the manner in which\r\n\r\nthe Government conducted the election campaign was\r\n\r\nthoroughly dishonest. The fifth possibility of the\r\n\r\nprotest votes is that the referendum machinery was\r\n\r\nrigged,  the  count was false, the  Superintendent\r\n\r\nwas not true to the Referendum Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see, Mr Speaker, Sir, although the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Anson  supports  the  proposition  that  the\r\n\r\nunmarked  ballot papers be recognised  as  protest\r\n\r\nvotes  for  one reason, and one reason  only,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  have put in that  amendment,  I\r\n\r\nsuggest, in order that they might go out later  on\r\n\r\nand tell the people that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly  admitted that B should  be  protest\r\n\r\nvotes because of A, B, C, D, E and F. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I cannot subscribe to that view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me deal with the question of\r\n\r\nwhether  the White Paper is a phoney one. We  have\r\n\r\nalways  taken the view on this side of  the  House\r\n\r\n- the  Front  Bench  of the Opposition - that  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  was  the best possible  thing  that\r\n\r\ncould   have   been  obtained  in  the   existing\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> It has been improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> That is a matter of opinion. The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson has said, \"The  result  of  the\r\n\r\nchange is more than a mere change in nomenclature;\r\n\r\nbe  satisfied.\" Well, if he is satisfied, so  much\r\n\r\nthe  better. So far as I am concerned, the  change\r\n\r\nin  nomenclature  has made no  difference  to  the\r\n\r\nlegal  position of citizenship or  to  the  rights\r\n\r\nwhich   we   will   get  under   the   change   in\r\n\r\nnomenclature.  So  far  as  I  am  concerned,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  to  my mind,  there  has  been  no\r\n\r\nchange. If the Member for Anson has interpreted it\r\n\r\nto  mean  something else, I am sure that Singapore\r\n\r\nis grateful to him, because no doubt the fact that\r\n\r\nhe  has  changed  his mind on that  has  helped  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of people to make up their minds  to  vote\r\n\r\nfor A. I am sure of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, Sir, that the referendum paper did\r\n\r\nnot  contain fair alternatives. I do not subscribe\r\n\r\nto  that. I subscr1be to the proposition that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum   paper  contained  all  the   possible\r\n\r\nalternatives in the circumstances. Therefore. I do\r\n\r\nnot agree with the Member for Anson that it was  a\r\n\r\n\"dirty  paper\".  He has all along maintained  that\r\n\r\nthe  referendum paper was a \"dirty paper\"  because\r\n\r\nit  posed  impossible alternatives.  Now,  I  have\r\n\r\nnever  understood  the Member for  Anson  on  this\r\n\r\npoint,  and I would be glad to have an explanation\r\n\r\nfrom  him.  Sir,  as I understood the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson in this House, he has always maintained that\r\n\r\nthe referendum was a \"dirty paper\" because not one\r\n\r\nof  the three Alternatives posed on the paper  was\r\n\r\nacceptable to him or his Party. On that basis,  he\r\n\r\ncontended that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  was  unfair  to put them to  the  people.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  although I did not say  that  they\r\n\r\nwere  unfair,  I  could agree with  that  position\r\n\r\ntaken  up  by the Member for Anson, on  the  basis\r\n\r\nthat  he  felt  that  the White  Paper - Alternative\r\n\r\nA - was  not what he wanted. On that basis, I  could\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the three Alternatives  posed  to\r\n\r\nthe electorate were unacceptable and therefore  it\r\n\r\nwas  a \"dirty paper\". That is correct and logical.\r\n\r\nBut  after  the amendment which has been  effected\r\n\r\nsubsequent  to  the return of the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nfrom  London,  the Member for Anson conceded  that\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper was everything he could hope  for\r\n\r\nas  a result of that amendment. Now, if the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson honestly believed that Alternative A was\r\n\r\nacceptable,  how does the referendum  paper  still\r\n\r\ncontinue to be dirty?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of explanation, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The answer is a very simple one.\r\n\r\nThe  Workers' Party has accepted A as  amended  in\r\n\r\nthe light of assurances and explanation.

Fair questions, mind you.\r\n\r\n\"fair\"  is  not a word on which everybody  agrees.\r\n\r\nWhat is fair to the Member for Anson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmight   not   be  fair  to  me.  I  consider   the\r\n\r\nalternatives  fair. The Member for Anson  did  not\r\n\r\nconsider   them   fair  because  none   of   those\r\n\r\nalternatives  were  acceptable  to  him.  On  that\r\n\r\nbasis,  I  saw  sense in his contention  that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum paper was a \"dirty paper\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assume, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the\r\n\r\ncitizenship   proposals  which  were  subsequently\r\n\r\naltered  had  been there present  when  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  proposals  were  being  discussed  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  I  must, therefore, assume that  on  those\r\n\r\nconditions   the  Member  for  Anson  would   have\r\n\r\naccepted   the   White  Paper,   and   the   first\r\n\r\nalternative was Alternative A. He would  then  not\r\n\r\nhave  objected to the paper on the basis that  not\r\n\r\none of the alternatives was unacceptable either to\r\n\r\nhim  or  to his Party. At the conclusion  of  that\r\n\r\ndebate,  it was a fair position he held,  but  two\r\n\r\nweeks  before  the  referendum  took  place,   his\r\n\r\nposition  had  altered and I could  not  therefore\r\n\r\nunderstand the Member for Anson saying, \"I  accept\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper proposal Alternative A - the  right\r\n\r\nproposition: it is a fair proposition but  cast  a\r\n\r\nblank  vote.\"  I  have  not yet  understood  that.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Member for Anson's statement  says,\r\n\r\n\"Because  the  referendum paper is  unfair,  those\r\n\r\nvotes  must  be  treated as  protest  votes,\"  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I do not accept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other points made was that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the referendum rallies  was  unfair\r\n\r\nand  that  it told a number of lies. A  number  of\r\n\r\nthings were said about marked ballot papers, about\r\n\r\nnumbers  being behind ballot papers. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I  am  fairly experienced  at  the  game  of\r\n\r\npolitics. I have been in at every single  election\r\n\r\nthat  has  taken place. If I have not participated\r\n\r\nin  them personally, I have been interested in the\r\n\r\nparticipants, and I remember the complaints of all\r\n\r\nthe   defeated  Parties.  The  complaints  of  all\r\n\r\ndefeated  Parties  are  that  the  other  side  is\r\n\r\nunfair.  It  is  a  human  weakness  which  people\r\n\r\nexploit  in  their  moments of  defeat.  When  the\r\n\r\nProgressive Party was defeated, some of them said,\r\n\r\n\"Unfair.  The Labour Front was unfair.\"  When  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  was  defeated by  the  P.A.P.,  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front said, \"The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was  unfair:  the  P.A.P. threatened  the\r\n\r\npeople; the P.A.P. did this thing and that thing.\"\r\n\r\nIt  is curious, Mr Speaker, Sir, in the light  of\r\n\r\nwhat has happened, that the same objections to the\r\n\r\nreferendum  should be brought up  by  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.   The  objections  which   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis are now bringing up with reference to the\r\n\r\nreferendum proceedings are exactly the  same  sort\r\n\r\nof  objections  that the defeated  Parties  raised\r\n\r\nwith  reference  to the P.A.P. At that  time,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Member for Hong Lim was on their\r\n\r\nside. The Member for Queenstown was on their side.\r\n\r\nEverything  seemed fair to them then. The  numbers\r\n\r\non  the  backs of the ballot papers did  not  then\r\n\r\nworry the voters, hut apparently for the last  two\r\n\r\nweeks  or  so they have been worrying the  voters.\r\n\r\nSo, where is the truth in all these allegations? I\r\n\r\ndo  not  accept  them.  It may  be  that  you  can\r\n\r\nfrighten a hundred or two hundred people, but  you\r\n\r\ncannot  frighten  three hundred thousand  or  four\r\n\r\nhundred  thousand people with these  stories,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir. You can intimidate one or two;  you\r\n\r\ncan  intimidate  a few, but you cannot  intimidate\r\n\r\npeople in the mass on the basis that there will be\r\n\r\nnumbers on the back of ballot papers and that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will see them and will  come  to  know\r\n\r\nthat you have voted the wrong way. After this, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  going to imprison you,  take  your\r\n\r\ncitizenship away, send you back to China or  India\r\n\r\nor Ceylon, or wherever you came from originally. I\r\n\r\ndo  not accept that, Mr Speaker. It does not work\r\n\r\nout like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last proposition which the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nput  forward,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  was  that  the\r\n\r\ncounting was all phoney. It is a very unfair thing\r\n\r\nto  say  that, Mr Speaker, because  a  number  of\r\n\r\nofficials were involved in this. I was present  at\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Badminton Hall from 9 o'clock. I saw\r\n\r\nthe ballot boxes arrive. Nothing happened to them.\r\n\r\nThey  were under proper guard. Everything was done\r\n\r\nproperly.  When  the last ballot  boxes  arrived - I\r\n\r\nthink   it  was  at  about  half-past  eleven   or\r\n\r\nthereabouts -  the  Superintendent  offered   every\r\n\r\nsingle Member there an opportunity of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninspecting  all  the boxes to see that  the  seals\r\n\r\nwere  intact, and after all the Members  who  were\r\n\r\nentitled to inspect the boxes were satisfied  that\r\n\r\nthey  were intact, the count then began.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  count began soon after twelve, if I  remember\r\n\r\ncorrectly.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am  revealing  no\r\n\r\nsecret,  but  within half an  hour  of  the  count\r\n\r\nstarting, one knew the verdict of the people.  One\r\n\r\ndid  not have to wait for the whole of the  count.\r\n\r\nWithin  half  an hour of the count, it  was  quite\r\n\r\nobvious  which  way the voting was going.  It  was\r\n\r\nobvious  that Alternative A was going to  win  and\r\n\r\nwin  handsomely. There was no question of anything\r\n\r\nbeing  rigged. Let us assume that there  had  been\r\n\r\nrigging  in  the  voting.  Rigging  of  how   many\r\n\r\nvotes - thousands  upon  thousands  upon   thousands\r\n\r\nwithout being known? Impossible! If it had been  a\r\n\r\nclose  one,  if Alternative A had got 45  and  the\r\n\r\nblank  votes  had  got 44, all  these  accusations\r\n\r\nmight have been relevant. But in the circumstances\r\n\r\nwhen  the  blank papers only had 25 per  cent  and\r\n\r\nAlternative A had 71 per cent, the leeway  was  so\r\n\r\nwide.  And when the position became quite apparent\r\n\r\nafter half an hour of the count to anybody who was\r\n\r\npresent around the 51 tables, I cannot accept  the\r\n\r\naccusation  that the count on the  referendum  was\r\n\r\nrigged. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, on all  those\r\n\r\ncounts, I cannot accept the amendment proposed  by\r\n\r\nthe,  Member for Queenstown. I have sympathy  for\r\n\r\nhim  in the latter part of the amendment where  it\r\n\r\nsays, \"unmarked and uncertain ballot papers be not\r\n\r\ncounted as supporting any of the Alternatives A. B\r\n\r\nor  C\".

I\r\n\r\nwonder if there are any Members who wish to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, Members of the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nleft the Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I do, Sir. If it please you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  can understand the disgust  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis feel. You will forgive me,  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  I  do  make a note of the fact that  they  are\r\n\r\nwalking out of this Chamber for the record. I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  their disgust, because  not  only  has\r\n\r\ndecency  now fled, but even logic and sanity  have\r\n\r\nfled  by  the action taken by the Government  with\r\n\r\nthe  Front  Bench of the Opposition. Because  what\r\n\r\nhas  transpired  is this. The Government  did  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  clean its dirty stables. We  offered  to\r\n\r\nclean  it  for  them. There  was  no  need  to  be\r\n\r\ndishonest  about the blank votes. They said,  \"Oh,\r\n\r\nyes,  now  we  agree there was no  need.  We  were\r\n\r\nplaying cat and mouse, or pseudo-prostitutes, just\r\n\r\nto  draw  out the Barisan.\" They have  drawn  them\r\n\r\nout,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccording to them. But at this juncture, Sir,  why\r\n\r\ncontinue with the farce? We were prepared to clean\r\n\r\nup  their mess and bring back some sanity to these\r\n\r\nproceedings by declaring these blank votes  to  be\r\n\r\nvoid.  Now  they want to proceed with the  motion.\r\n\r\nWhat  is the sense of the motion? Mr Speaker,  in\r\n\r\nall  your  experience,  in  all  the  history   of\r\n\r\ndemocratic   institutions.  I  ask  you   in   all\r\n\r\nseriousness,  have  you come  across  a  provision\r\n\r\nwhereby  the majority seek to compel the  minority\r\n\r\nto  vote  in  a  specific  fashion?  It  says  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Assemblymen opposed the amended  White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger  proposals and calls  upon  them  to\r\n\r\ndecide.  And then, where do we go from  there?  We\r\n\r\nhave  told  them that in our view blank votes  and\r\n\r\nuncertain  votes should not be counted, should  be\r\n\r\nnull  and  void.  We have told  them  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimmoral  to  give  any value to  blank  votes  and\r\n\r\nuncertain votes. They say, \"No, you fix a  value.\"\r\n\r\nWhere   do   we  go  from  there?  That   is   the\r\n\r\nimbecility - if you will forgive the expression - \r\n\r\nof   this  extraordinary  conduct.  What  is   the\r\n\r\nrationale?  Where  is  the logic?  Let  us  forget\r\n\r\ndecency,  Sir, because it seems  decency  belongs\r\n\r\nonly to chickens. We are in a house of black belts\r\n\r\nand  green  belts and dirty belts - so dirty  that\r\n\r\nthey are black with dirt, stinking with filth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the meaning of this present resolution?\r\n\r\nI  ask  particularly. Sir, of the Opposition Front\r\n\r\nBench  which did not have to dirty its hands - why?\r\n\r\nWhy  does  it proceed with the illogical absurdity\r\n\r\nof  compelling Opposition Members to vote? How are\r\n\r\nthey  going  to do it? What is the coercive  power\r\n\r\nthey have? Supposing they pass it. Sir, they have\r\n\r\ncalled upon us, so what? Is there time for us  to\r\n\r\nproduce  a motion, Mr Speaker, in answer to  this\r\n\r\nabsurd  and illogical call of the Assembly!  There\r\n\r\nis a horrible phrase in the English language which\r\n\r\ncould  be applied to the People's Action Party  at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture and it should be most  appropriate.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, Mr Speaker, I do not think  I\r\n\r\ncould  hope  to  have  your  attention  adequately\r\n\r\ndiverted  for  a  sufficient period  in  order  to\r\n\r\npermit me\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  enunciate  it. But I say, why  did  the  Front\r\n\r\nBench of the Opposition have to put their hands to\r\n\r\nthis filth? Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, so they are going to force us who did\r\n\r\nnot  agree  with the merger proposals in November,\r\n\r\nto  say  whether the 144,000 votes plus the  2,000\r\n\r\nvotes shall belong anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Speaker, they will have to pass - and I\r\n\r\nremind the Front Bench of the Opposition - the first\r\n\r\npart,  that  the  2,370  uncertain  ballot  papers\r\n\r\nbelong  to  A.  Oh,  surely they are  sufficiently\r\n\r\nproud  of the result of A without seeking to sully\r\n\r\nand  dirty  that result by this cheap stealing  of\r\n\r\n2,000  uncertain votes. Why do they want  to  make\r\n\r\nthemselves  party  to that disgraceful  act?  And\r\n\r\nthen   they   are  asking  us,  the  Back-benches,\r\n\r\ncompelling  us, uniquely in history, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  tyranny  of the majority - not a  question  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  any  more - this is what we  have  learnt\r\n\r\nfrom  the  People's Action Party, that  democracy\r\n\r\ncan, in fact, be a tyranny  - a tyranny in between\r\n\r\nelections - a disgraceful Fascist tyranny. And  now,\r\n\r\neven Fascists would not consider it appropriate to\r\n\r\nsay  not merely that they will rule, but to  force\r\n\r\nyou  to  make  a choice which yon do not  want  to\r\n\r\nmake,  that  you  think is immoral and  dishonest.\r\n\r\nImmoral and dishonest because they are not  asking\r\n\r\nus to say what we would do, but they are asking us\r\n\r\nto put a value on blank votes. [Laughter] It is  a\r\n\r\ncurious mentality and it seems that there are many\r\n\r\nof  them.  It  is  a  curious mentality,  which  I\r\n\r\nconfess  at this stage is beyond my understanding,\r\n\r\nthat  can  permit itself laughter at  this  stage.\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the peak of contempt for the democratic\r\n\r\nprocess.  The  democratic  process  allows    the\r\n\r\nmajority  to rule; it does not allow the  majority\r\n\r\nto bully, to brow-beat and insult those who are in\r\n\r\nopposition. We, and I felt the Member -  where  was\r\n\r\nit,  Sir,  where the gentleman from the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPeople's Alliance said that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

It is in truth and in fact a\r\n\r\ncorkscrew, but what surprises me is that those  on\r\n\r\nthe  Front Bench of the Opposition who have a  not\r\n\r\nunreasonable  hope  of being the  next  Government\r\n\r\nshould  be dragged into this P.A.P. well of filth,\r\n\r\nshould  plunge in merrily and be party to  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  crudest  and  most shameless and  disgraceful\r\n\r\nexhibitions  of  the tyranny of democracy  between\r\n\r\nelections  when  the majority has no  respect  for\r\n\r\ndemocratic  traditions,  no  respect  for   public\r\n\r\nopinion,  no  respect for decency, no respect  for\r\n\r\nlogic, no respect even for sanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Go on!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Well, Sir, we have heard a squeak\r\n\r\nout  of the Minister for Education.

The  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore have already given their decision in no\r\n\r\nuncertain  terms that they are for Malaysia,  and\r\n\r\nthe numbers in which they voted are such that  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  really matter now as to how the  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  are  to be interpreted. But our stand  has\r\n\r\nalways  been  that blank votes  are  blank.  They\r\n\r\nshould  mean nothing. They are not protest votes,\r\n\r\nSir.  We  opposed the amendment just now because\r\n\r\nthey  asked  for an interpretation so that  blank\r\n\r\nvotes  could  be regarded as protest votes.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  was wrong. We also do not believe that they\r\n\r\nshould  be  regarded as yes votes,  although  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson has so interpreted it  that  he\r\n\r\nwas for Alternative A and yet he would protest by\r\n\r\ncasting  a  blank  vote.  Sir,  to  people   like\r\n\r\nmyself - ordinary folks - we are confused, because if\r\n\r\nwe  are for Alternative A, we must be voting  for\r\n\r\nAlternative  A. The blank vote means nothing  and\r\n\r\nit should mean nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our stand is that from the start there\r\n\r\nshould  not have been this manoeuvre and counter-manoeuvre  between the Barisan Sosialis  and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Let the people decide and the people  have\r\n\r\nnow  decided. Let the blank votes be  counted  as\r\n\r\nblank,  as having no value whatsoever;  that  has\r\n\r\nbeen our stand, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that after the people have decided in\r\n\r\nno uncertain terms for Malaysia, we should now co-operate to make Malaysia a success. We should not\r\n\r\ncarry  on this bitter fight over blank votes  for\r\n\r\nanother  few years, making it an election  issue.\r\n\r\nWe  have  already said - and Members  of  different\r\n\r\nParties  have said too - that this is not a  party\r\n\r\nissue, this is not a political issue and that the\r\n\r\nvictory would not be a party victory for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment or for any other Party. On that basis,\r\n\r\nSir,  the people have expressed their wishes;  we\r\n\r\nhave  to accept their will and we should  try  to\r\n\r\nimplement  that will. We have already  heard  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister.  The Minister for  Culture  says\r\n\r\nhere  that  they  do not regard it  as  a  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nvictory. Therefore, the Barisan should not regard\r\n\r\nit  as  a Barisan defeat. It is the will  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  However, Sir, maybe the  Press  have  an\r\n\r\ninterest in keeping up the fight for the sake  of\r\n\r\npublicity  purposes and they have said again  and\r\n\r\nagain  that this is a P.A.P. victory and  so  on.\r\n\r\nOnly  yesterday they had a big headline  \"P.A.P. - How  we  won\".  That  might  have  irritated  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  people,  but  in the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Malaya,  Singapore  and  Malaysia  we\r\n\r\nbelieve that we should stop this fight over blank\r\n\r\nvotes.  Blank  votes mean nothing, neither  \"yes\"\r\n\r\nvotes  nor  \"no\" votes. Well, if they are  blank,\r\n\r\nlet  them be blank, let them not be counted.  But\r\n\r\nthe  people have decided by 70 per cent that they\r\n\r\nwant  Malaysia on the lines of Alternative A  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  most important  thing  for  us  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I might indicate what is in my\r\n\r\nmind.
