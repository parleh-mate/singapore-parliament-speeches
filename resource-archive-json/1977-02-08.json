Then the Americans were still in Vietnam\r\n\r\nand  backing the Thieu regime. Now, they have departed\r\n\r\neven  from Thailand. 1972 was before the oil  crisis,\r\n\r\nand more rapid growth was in the offing. Now, there is\r\n\r\nuncertainty  and anxiety amongst the major  industrial\r\n\r\nnations  of  the West. It is an open question  whether\r\n\r\nthey can co-ordinate their economic policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nespecially  America, Japan and Germany,  to  stimulate\r\n\r\nrecovery from recession without again another bout  of\r\n\r\nhigh  inflation. We have now to be prepared for slower\r\n\r\ngrowth  rates, and  adjust accordingly  our  spending\r\n\r\nhabits, both as a government and as individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My government has again been returned to office. The\r\n\r\nPAP won in all constituencies. This government has the\r\n\r\nhighest number of votes, and the highest percentage of\r\n\r\nvotes  (72.4%) cast in the six general elections  held\r\n\r\nsince representative government in 1955. This vote  of\r\n\r\nconfidence  imposes  a  heavy  responsibility  on   my\r\n\r\nMinisters to act fairly but firmly. My government will\r\n\r\nexercise  its  authority to govern with circumspection\r\n\r\nand moderation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also places on all Honourable Members, especially\r\n\r\nthose not holding office, the duty to ensure that  all\r\n\r\nshades  of  opinion  out  in  the  constituencies  are\r\n\r\nvigorously  voiced  in  Parliamentary  questions   and\r\n\r\ndebates.  No  major  policy or legislation  should  be\r\n\r\npassed  without the closest scrutiny, and passed  only\r\n\r\nafter the most thorough debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandate on which my government was elected is\r\n\r\nclearcut.  The  issues were fought for months,  indeed\r\n\r\nyears,  before  the elections. Many of the  opposition\r\n\r\npolitical  parties, both those who took  part  in  the\r\n\r\nelections and those who did not, repeated the  demands\r\n\r\nof  the  Communist  Party of Malaya (Malaya  including\r\n\r\nSingapore)   (CPM), regularly  voiced   over   their\r\n\r\nclandestine   radio.   These   demands   include   the\r\n\r\nunconditional  release  of  all  communist  and   pro-communist\r\n\r\ndetainees,  abolition  of   the   Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity Act, and abolition of National Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people have rejected these and supported the\r\n\r\ngovernment, But it would be naive to believe that  the\r\n\r\nCommunist Party of Malaya, in their armed struggle for\r\n\r\na   communist  Malaya, will  not  try  to  abuse  the\r\n\r\nopportunities  of  the democratic processes,  and  the\r\n\r\nmass media, to help camouflage their armed struggle to\r\n\r\ngrab  power.  They  will continue to  rebuild  amongst\r\n\r\nsmall  misguided student groups, like the Malayan  New\r\n\r\nDemocratic Youth League (MNDYL). Student groups in the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic and in other tertiary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstitutions  have been and will be  their  recruiting\r\n\r\nareas.  Small  groups of activists  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nmanipulate our student organisations abroad in Britain\r\n\r\nand Australia, in active collaboration with British or\r\n\r\nAustralian Marxists and Trotskyites, as the  case  may\r\n\r\nbe.  They now style themselves as the \"new left\".  But\r\n\r\ntheir  techniques  of  oft repeated  lies, and  their\r\n\r\nexploitation  of innocent soft-hearted or  soft-headed\r\n\r\n\"liberals\",   are  long-established   techniques   and\r\n\r\ntactics  of  the communists, learned by the  CPM  from\r\n\r\nother  communist parties in Europe and Asia,  repeated\r\n\r\nwith  minor  variations on new audiences in  different\r\n\r\nplaces.  And  there is always the younger, politically\r\n\r\ninnocent, if not naive, generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote is also a renewed mandate not to be\r\n\r\nbeguiled  away  from a most necessary law,  which  the\r\n\r\nBritish themselves drafted and promulgated when  faced\r\n\r\nwith  communist insurgency in 1948, namely, detention\r\n\r\nof  communist and pro-communist elements without going\r\n\r\nthrough  the  processes of a public trial accorded  to\r\n\r\nordinary  criminals.  My government,  in  accord  with\r\n\r\nhumane  sentiment,  will release  them  if  they  will\r\n\r\ndenounce  the CPM's use of force to seize  power, and\r\n\r\nthemselves  forswear  the use of  force  to  unseat  a\r\n\r\nconstitutionally elected government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest it be forgotten, it is a mandate also to reject\r\n\r\nthe soft-headed, pernicious policies that all the good\r\n\r\nthings in life, from bus rides to PUB charges, can  be\r\n\r\ngiven  for free, or otherwise to reduce the  fares  or\r\n\r\ncharges  when the costs are going up. Only  education,\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment and housing will be subsidised,  in\r\n\r\norder  to help everyone to be educated and healthy  to\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  look after himself. But nominal  charges\r\n\r\nmust  be  paid even for schools, to pay for the  extra\r\n\r\ncurricular  activities,  and  hospitals, to   prevent\r\n\r\nunnecessary pressure on medical facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before us are some terrifying examples of what can\r\n\r\nhappen  to  those  who  go in  for  soft  options  and\r\n\r\nsubsidised  living, a temptation in  any  one-man-one-vote\r\n\r\nelection campaign. Some once-great nations  have\r\n\r\nbeen beguiled by this illusion that somebody else will\r\n\r\npay, that all people had to do was to elect a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngovernment that would take money from those  who  have\r\n\r\nand give it to those who have not. Indeed, the British\r\n\r\nPrime Minister lamented a few weeks ago that the  most\r\n\r\nhateful  slogan  he had heard was  made  at  a  recent\r\n\r\nprotest  march of Marxist and Trotskyite  infiltrators\r\n\r\nof his Labour. Party:\r\n\r\n\"What  do  we  want? Everything! When do we  want  it?\r\n\r\nNow!\" A great people have been temporarily reduced  to\r\n\r\nstraitened  circumstances by this excessive cushioning\r\n\r\nof  life  by  state subsidies. When my Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nvisited China last year, his realistic communist hosts\r\n\r\ndescribed such sad situations as \"teachers by negative\r\n\r\nexample\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My government holds firm to this simple truth: that\r\n\r\nto  get  from  each his best, rewards and  recognition\r\n\r\nmust  go  to  those  who  excel in  consistently  high\r\n\r\nperformance. Between the soft solutions of  some  West\r\n\r\nEuropean  socialists of equal rewards,  and  the  hard\r\n\r\nrealities  of Asian conditions, my government  has  no\r\n\r\ndoubts  that  the  people  of Singapore  unequivocally\r\n\r\nuphold  Asian precepts - \"From each his best;  To  each\r\n\r\nhis  worth\". The communists in China have a  variation\r\n\r\nof this in their aphorism: \"Ge jin suo neng, an lao\r\n\r\nfen  pei\"  ()  -  from  each\r\n\r\naccording  to  his ability, to each according  to  his\r\n\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are different from China. We have access\r\n\r\nto  modern  science  and  technology.  We  have  rapid\r\n\r\neconomic  and material transformation that comes  from\r\n\r\nthese  modern management methods, capital  inputs  and\r\n\r\nmarketing  knowhow.  But  we  must  not  abandon   the\r\n\r\ncardinal  precepts of our long-proven culture systems,\r\n\r\nprecepts  which  enabled some Asian  civilisations  to\r\n\r\nsurvive, and  without a break in continuity,  floods.\r\n\r\nfamines,  pestilence,  wars,  disasters  and   foreign\r\n\r\nconquests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we admire and must learn and acquire their\r\n\r\nscience  and technology, their management  skills  and\r\n\r\nmarketing  knowhow, we do not seek to model our  lives\r\n\r\non  Western social mores and their contemporary  life-styles.\r\n\r\nWe must learn the experience of the Japanese -\r\n\r\nhow,  in  less  than a hundred years since  the  Meiji\r\n\r\nRestoration  of  1868,  they  have  become  a   modern\r\n\r\nindustrial   state,  without  abandoning   their   own\r\n\r\ncultural traditions. Their experience is more relevant\r\n\r\nto  us  than those of the countries of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe   exceptions   are  perhaps   West   Germany   and\r\n\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to formulate our way of life, taking what is\r\n\r\nbest  from  the West and fitting it into the Singapore\r\n\r\ncontext.  We  must  not  allow  our  values  and   our\r\n\r\nphilosophy   of   what  is  good  government   to   be\r\n\r\noverwhelmed  by  the  standards  and  norms   of   the\r\n\r\ncontemporary  West, regardless of their  relevance  to\r\n\r\nour  social, economic and political conditions, simply\r\n\r\nbecause, for the time being the West have the material\r\n\r\nabundance and technological superiority.

The intention is  that  there  will\r\n\r\nalways be finance at reasonably low interest rates  to\r\n\r\nencourage sound projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will, however, be no extravagance in public\r\n\r\nsector  expenditures. These will be  more  efficiently\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by a new style budget by 1979 This  budget\r\n\r\nwill  enable  the work programmes of each Ministry  of\r\n\r\nGovernment to be examined against its targets and  its\r\n\r\nperformance  Funds  can  then be  allocated  on  their\r\n\r\nreview\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore grow, what we collect from our present\r\n\r\ntaxes  grows  also. With good growth, we shall  rarely\r\n\r\nhave  to put up tax rates or think of major new  taxes\r\n\r\nto  pay  for our increased needs. But we may want, as\r\n\r\none way of helping to encourage or discourage one kind\r\n\r\nof  activity  over another, to change  a  tax  or  add\r\n\r\nanother  to  our  tax system.

Only in this way  is  it\r\n\r\npossible for a small country to achieve  the  minimum\r\n\r\nsecurity required for confidence and development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since our defence forces have to import\r\n\r\nnearly all  their weapons and equipment,  the  rising\r\n\r\nprices of  these  products impose a severe  financial\r\n\r\nburden. It  is  therefore necessary to  exercise  the\r\n\r\nutmost economy  in defence expenditure.  In  November\r\n\r\n1976, a  committee of Finance and Defence Ministries'\r\n\r\nofficials was  appointed  to  maintain  a  continuing\r\n\r\nsurveillance over costs and to prune down expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also necessary to economise in the use of\r\n\r\nmanpower. As a result of successful family planning in\r\n\r\npast years,  the  number of young men  available  for\r\n\r\nnational service in future years will show  a  steady\r\n\r\nbut relentless decline. In ten years' time, the number\r\n\r\navailable will be nearly 30% less than what it is now.\r\n\r\nThere are  a number of implications which  are  being\r\n\r\nstudied in the Ministry of Defence. It will certainly\r\n\r\nbe necessary to trim down manpower establishments and\r\n\r\nreduce or even abolish vocations which do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontribute much  to  the combat  efficiency  of  army\r\n\r\nunits.

In\r\n\r\nthe longer  term,  if  force  structure  is  to   be\r\n\r\nmaintained at current levels, it is more than  likely\r\n\r\nthat national  service will have to  be  extended  to\r\n\r\nwomen, for a start, possibly on a selective basis,  to\r\n\r\nfill up non-combat posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">GOH KENG SWEE</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minister of Defence</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINISTRY OF LABOUR</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an open economy.

This  stage  which  is\r\n\r\nestimated to  cost $522 million and is scheduled  for\r\n\r\ncompletion in 1980 will increase the total generating\r\n\r\ncapacity to 2090 MW. Plans for Stage III of Senoko are\r\n\r\npresently under study. For demand beyond the  1980's,\r\n\r\nanother power  station  will  be  necessary  and  its\r\n\r\nproposed location is under consideration. Concomitant\r\n\r\nwith the  generation  of  more  electricity  is   the\r\n\r\nextension of  transmission  and  distribution  system\r\n\r\nwhich will cost $791.7 million over the next 5 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;69% of the Board's annual recurrent expenditure\r\n\r\nbefore depreciation and interest charges is  on  fuel\r\n\r\noil for electricity generation. Continuous efforts are\r\n\r\nbeing made  to  increase  operational  efficiency  of\r\n\r\ngenerators to conserve the consumption of fuel oil. As\r\n\r\na result of increasing efficiency, the Board has,  so\r\n\r\nfar, been able to absorb the 10% increase (from  $160\r\n\r\nto $177  per  ton)  in the price of  fuel  oil  since\r\n\r\nOctober 1975,  without  increasing  the   price   of\r\n\r\nelectricity to consumers. However, the latest increase\r\n\r\nin oil  price will necessitate an upward revision  of\r\n\r\nthe tariffs.

This scheme  and  the\r\n\r\nextension of  the recently completed  Choa  Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nTreatment Works, scheduled for operation by 1981, will\r\n\r\ncost $72 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Kranji-Pandan Scheme, water to the new\r\n\r\nreservoir flows through unprotected catchments and  is\r\n\r\nmore polluted  than conventional sources.

The principal  actors  in\r\n\r\nthis area are a handful of rich and powerful nations.\r\n\r\nSingapore's policy  would be to  stay  out  of  their\r\n\r\nconflicts but cooperate with them where their policies\r\n\r\nserve our national and regional interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insofar as regional politics is concerned, Singapore\r\n\r\nis aware that Western influence and involvement are no\r\n\r\nlonger dominant factors.

As a precaution vital \r\n\r\ninstallations will continue to be guarded by National Servicemen in the\r\n\r\nSpecial Constabulary and Vigilante Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Law and Order</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical development of Singapore especially over\r\n\r\nthe last ten years has resulted in major shifts in population, new roads \r\n\r\nand new centres of activity. For more efficient service and deployment, the boundaries of \r\n\r\nthe existing eight Police Divisions will be redrawn and two new \r\n\r\nDivisions eventually created. By 1980 almost 75% of the population will be living in HDB estates. \r\n\r\nBesides Queenstown and Toa Payoh Estate which already have a police \r\n\r\nstation each, other satellite towns, namely, the Jurong Town. Bedok New \r\n\r\nTown, Ang Mo Kio Estate, Telok Blangah Estate and Woodlands Estate, \r\n\r\nwill have their own police stations. Eventually, all Special Constabulary personnel living in HDB estates \r\n\r\nwho are given patrol duties will patrol in the neighbourhood of their \r\n\r\nhomes under the Neighbourhood Policing Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The industrial, commercial and financial development in Singapore has\r\n\r\nchanged the priorities of the Police Department in two ways. First, the \r\n\r\nopportunities to commit fraud, criminal breach of trust and other \r\n\r\n\"white collar\" crimes have increased. Such cases will be increasingly \r\n\r\ncomplex. To deal \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith this new situation the Commercial Crime Branch of the CID will be \r\n\r\nstrengthened with more lawyers and accountants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, new shopping complexes, departmental stores and high-rise\r\n\r\noffice blocks and private flats mostly employ security guards. \r\n\r\nThe Police Department will take this into account when working out new \r\n\r\nmethods of policing. A Crime Prevention Branch has been established \r\n\r\nin the CID.  Besides educating the public in crime prevention this Branch will advise \r\n\r\ndevelopers and managements of commercial, industrial and residential \r\n\r\nbuildings on built-in security measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roads must be made safer for all road users. From the inception of the Points Demerit System on 1st March, 1975 till the end of 1976, 69 motorists have been suspended from driving and another 1 736 warned, The effect on road safety was however not satisfactory. The number of accidents involving serious injury dropped by some 8.8% in 1975 but increased slightly in 1976. The number of deaths caused by road accidents hardly declined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 69 motorists who were suspended from driving, 31 were bus drivers and 16 lorry drivers. This is because the driver of a larger vehicle knows that in any collision with a smaller vehicle, it is unlikely that he will be hurt seriously. He expects all smaller cars to give way to him. This might-is-right mentality must be reversed. With economic progress there will be more heavy vehicles of all types on the road. Owners of private cars will continue to change over to smaller cars. The law will be changed to provide for two things. First, in any collision between two vehicles of different size and weight the driver of the larger vehicle will have to prove that he is not in the wrong, i.e, a presumption which he can rebut. Second, in any fatal accident the driver who is charged in court for dangerous driving will immediately have his driving licence suspended until his trial is completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fatal accidents and those leaving the victims maimed result in a loss to society especially if the victims are young. The Points Demerit System will be revised so that offences such as inconsiderate, careless and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndangerous driving will carry more penalty points. A nationwide \"Road Safety For You\" Campaign will be launched in June 1977. Its aim is to remind both motorists and pedestrians of the need to observe the Highway Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The Drug Problem </i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost 90% of those detained in 1975 for drug abuse were between 15 - 29 years old. In 1970 this age group was estimated at 582, 900 accounting for 28.1% of the population. By 1980 it is projected that this age group will have increased to 810, 000 or 33.8% of the population. The spread of the drug problem must be stopped quickly. Drug abusers and addicts must be flushed out and isolated for a sufficiently long period to prevent them from infecting others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this the Police, Special Constabulary and Vigilante Corps will be used extensively to round up drug addicts. More centres will be established to rehabilitate the addicts. The Central Narcotics Bureau will concentrate on smashing the drug supply networks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it more difficult for subversives, drug traffickers and criminals to nip into and out of Singapore the Immigration Department will introduce exit control early in 1978. By that time the Marine Branch of the Police will have intensified the patrolling of the Straits of Johore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, it is necessary to make it more difficult for subversives, drug traffickers and criminals to carry on their illegal activities in Singapore unnoticed. National Servicemen with police training will provide a good coverage of the vicinity of their home and place of employment. It is estimated that by 1980 there will be 4300 full-time National Servicemen on active duty and 6800 Reservists in the Special Constabulary and Vigilante Corps. There will also be some 66, 000 part-time National Servicemen in the SC and VC. Many of them will be organised to serve as a link between the enforcement agencies and the people. In HDB estates they can serve in block committees, one to each or several blocks of flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the best of prevention there will still be criminals and prisoners. Since April 1976\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) has introduced new industries in the prisons and created new jobs for 740 prisoners.

The remaining 305 prisoners will be given work when the new workshops are ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCORE will next make the traditional prison industries such as laundry, furniture-making and metalwork more competitive.

Unfortunately it has not\r\n\r\nled to a society where all men and women are equal  in\r\n\r\nhealth  and opportunities. Indeed, they are locked  in\r\n\r\nbitter class conflicts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They, the British, who taught us that excellence\r\n\r\nshould be rewarded and honoured in order that all  can\r\n\r\nbenefit from the exceptional talents of the few,  have\r\n\r\nnow ended up by punishing the talented few, to satisfy\r\n\r\nthe doctrinal follies of the even fewer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May last year, several of my colleagues and I had\r\n\r\nthe  privilege  of  an  extensive  tour  of  China,  a\r\n\r\ncompletely  different society in  which  all  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  have  to  find satisfaction in hard  work,  and\r\n\r\nrecognition,  not in material rewards, but  in  public\r\n\r\napprobation.  China may be too austere, too  severe  a\r\n\r\nmodel,  for Singaporeans. We have come to expect  many\r\n\r\nof   the   conveniences   of   life   as   essentials.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  considering the state of  our  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, our workers should do well  to  remember\r\n\r\nthat China, which today has the hydrogen bomb,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  missiles  and the satellites, got  there  through\r\n\r\nsheer  hard  work, often with nothing in  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nmillions   of   bare  hands  than  the   simplest   of\r\n\r\nagricultural implements, like the shovel and the hoe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans, it cannot be a simple copying of\r\n\r\neither  China,  the Malaysian archipelago,  or  India,\r\n\r\nfrom whence most of our ancestors came. Nor can we  be\r\n\r\na  copy of Britain, which governed Singapore for  some\r\n\r\n150  years,  but  as  a  colony through  an  appointed\r\n\r\ngovernor, not an elected Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are different from China, the Malaysian\r\n\r\narchipelago,  India and Britain. We are  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nWe must seek practical solutions, solutions which will\r\n\r\nwork  in  our  context,  to  our  problems  which  are\r\n\r\nbasically Southeast Asian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, material incentives, strenuously\r\n\r\ncondemned  in  some  communist  countries   are   very\r\n\r\nnecessary  for Singapore's continued economic  growth.\r\n\r\nAnd  let  us not deceive ourselves. Continued economic\r\n\r\ngrowth, however slower it has become compared to  what\r\n\r\nit  was before the oil crisis, is most necessary if we\r\n\r\nare  to  avoid sliding back to the harsh  poverty  and\r\n\r\ndegradation  of  the years during and after  the  war,\r\n\r\nuntil  recovery in the late 1950's. Indeed,  in  1965,\r\n\r\nwhen  we found ourselves suddenly out all on our  own,\r\n\r\nwithout  enough  land to grow food to feed  ourselves,\r\n\r\nmany  doubted  whether Singapore would  survive,  even\r\n\r\nwith   the  protection  of  British  and  Commonwealth\r\n\r\ntroops.  And in 1968, when the British announced  they\r\n\r\nwould  withdraw, nearly everyone wrote  us  off.  Even\r\n\r\nsome  of  our staunchest friends thought that the  end\r\n\r\nwas imminent and inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the people of Singapore, now a more tightly-knit\r\n\r\nsociety, had the will to succeed, They supported\r\n\r\ntheir  government in a national effort  to  solve  the\r\n\r\napparently unsolvable. Together, people and government\r\n\r\nput  in the hard work. Imaginative policies and  tough\r\n\r\nmeasures  enabled us to rise from the near-despair  of\r\n\r\nthe 1960's, to the relative security of today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have more than trebled the average earnings of\r\n\r\nthe  modal  group of workers since 1965;  we  have  in\r\n\r\nmoney  terms  increased our GDP from $2.9  billion  in\r\n\r\n1965,  by  five times, to $14.7 billion in 1976.

We put national solidarity over  and  above\r\n\r\ndifferences of race, language, and culture, And  there\r\n\r\nwas  that  willingness to subordinate  the  individual\r\n\r\ninterest   to   national  interests  to  ensure   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans would not go down,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our problems are now vastly different, The young,\r\n\r\nwith only faint memories of the anxious moments of the\r\n\r\ncrises and hardships of the last 20 years, crises  and\r\n\r\nhardships   their  parents  and  their  elders   still\r\n\r\nremember vividly, now take the relative prosperity  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  the  norm.  This  attitude, the   high\r\n\r\nexpectations,  the desire to seek jobs in  comfortable\r\n\r\nsurroundings,  the  impatience,  indeed  the   intense\r\n\r\nhaste,  to succeed financially - they could be sources\r\n\r\nof weakness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External economic factors have now become\r\n\r\nunfavourable. The young may yet get their  baptism  of\r\n\r\nthe  harsh  facts of life. In 1965, after  Separation,\r\n\r\nand 1968, when the British forces started to withdraw,\r\n\r\nexternal economic factors were favourable. Our friends\r\n\r\nand allies in the West feared for us. Because the West\r\n\r\nstill  had  strategic interests in this  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworld,  they went out of their way to help us.  Today,\r\n\r\nthey  themselves are in difficulties.  World  economic\r\n\r\nrecovery is still sluggish and uncertain. The price of\r\n\r\noil  is dependent on the Saudis and the Emirates, and\r\n\r\nwill  turn  on America's determination to resolve  the\r\n\r\nproblems of the Arabs and the Israelis,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programmes and policies which are set out in the\r\n\r\naddenda spell out what the government proposes  to  do\r\n\r\nin  the  fields of finance and economics,  social  and\r\n\r\nmedical services, education and defence. They are  all\r\n\r\nbased on this inexorable premise, that rewards must be\r\n\r\ncorrelated  to  work,  and  must  correspond  to   the\r\n\r\ncontribution  one  makes to the total  national  well-being.\r\n\r\nWe believe one truth to be self-evident:  that\r\n\r\nmore and more pay for less and less work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  lead  to  greater  and  greater  borrowing   and\r\n\r\neventual bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However difficult the going, and whatever the\r\n\r\nsurprises and setbacks, we can overcome them  provided\r\n\r\nwe  stay  alert  and  trim. The decisive  factors  are\r\n\r\nmorale  and  will.  If our people  are  determined  to\r\n\r\nsucceed, then realistic policies can be made to  work.\r\n\r\nTo  meet  unexpected contingencies, we can adjust  and\r\n\r\nadapt our policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man does not live by bread alone. Hence we take\r\n\r\nimmense  pride  that in the past two decades  we  have\r\n\r\nbegun  the  process  of  forging  one  people  out  of\r\n\r\ndisparate  groups brought together by the accident  of\r\n\r\nhistory. Disasters, floods and famines in China, India\r\n\r\nand the archipelago around us, led to successive waves\r\n\r\nof  migration of different peoples of different races,\r\n\r\ndifferent  religions and different cultures,  We  have\r\n\r\nbecome  a  more integrated society than we  have  ever\r\n\r\nbeen in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more, the differences between us, whether\r\n\r\nethnic, linguistic or cultural, are being blurred,  as\r\n\r\nour  children  go to the same schools, regardless  of\r\n\r\ntheir  parents'  wealth or status. We share  a  common\r\n\r\ndestiny. Each can keep his lifeline to his own culture\r\n\r\nand   value   systems  through  his  mother  language.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  are enlarging the common ground  we  all\r\n\r\nshare.  All  learn not only their mother  tongue, but\r\n\r\nalso the English language in our schools, the first to\r\n\r\nkeep  our identity the second to get access to science\r\n\r\nand   technology, and  facilitate  commerce  and  the\r\n\r\nexpansion of industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a more equal and more just society than it\r\n\r\nhas ever been in the past. This has only been achieved\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have eschewed punishing  those  who  have\r\n\r\nachieved  more  and  earned more,  because  they  have\r\n\r\nworked  harder  or shown greater enterprise.  But  the\r\n\r\ngovernment  is committed to help the most needy.  They\r\n\r\nshould  never be allowed to become a permanent  burden\r\n\r\non  the  rest of the community. They should be  helped\r\n\r\nthrough better education and health because then  they\r\n\r\ncan  be  better  themselves. We have established  high\r\n\r\nstandards  of education and health. They are  a  heavy\r\n\r\ndrain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non our scant resources. With a more favourable\r\n\r\nenvironment, we expect the less successful to have the\r\n\r\nchance to do better, to improve themselves and to make\r\n\r\na greater contribution to their own well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the philosophy which underlies all policies\r\n\r\nof the government However, it is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspirit of the people which can ensure the success of\r\n\r\nthese policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">LEE KUAN YEW</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Prime Minister</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
