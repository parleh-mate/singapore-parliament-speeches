However, from  a\r\n\r\nwebsite posting, it would appear that an illegal assembly had\r\n\r\ntaken  place  at the Speakers' Corner on 10th  December  last\r\n\r\nyear, which I had already discussed in this House at our last\r\n\r\nsitting.  Police is currently investigating into this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The website posting was in the\r\n\r\nThink  Centre website.  It was a report and, in  fact,  there\r\n\r\nwas  also a photograph of people with clenched fists  raised,\r\n\r\nand  the  report said that they chanted \"Abolish ISA\" several\r\n\r\ntimes.   The Police assessed that this may be indicative of a\r\n\r\ndemonstration having taken place.  So, they saw it  as  their\r\n\r\nduty to investigate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, this is pending investigations,\r\n\r\ntherefore, I am sure the Minister of State will not  want  to\r\n\r\ngo  too  much into the details of this particular case.   But\r\n\r\nmay  I  ask,  more generally, what is the difference  between\r\n\r\nspeech  and demonstrations?  And whether per se if I were  to\r\n\r\ngo  to the Speakers' Corner and clench my fist in the air, is\r\n\r\nthat a demonstration, Sir?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, at the last sitting, I\r\n\r\nhad  an exchange with Mr Jeyaretnam.  Many speakers have gone\r\n\r\nthere to speak.  Many people have gone there to listen.  They\r\n\r\nhave not met with any problems from the Police.  But if there\r\n\r\nis   an   organised  meeting  at  the  Speakers'  Corner   to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate, in this case, for the abolition of ISA, and five\r\n\r\nor  more  people gather there, then it is indicative evidence\r\n\r\nof  an illegal assembly having taken place.  So Police has to\r\n\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I take it then that it is not the\r\n\r\nclenched fist which he mentioned that is the cause.  May I go\r\n\r\non  to the next question, Sir?  This is whether five or  more\r\n\r\npeople  could  register to speak on the  same  topic,  either\r\n\r\nsequentially or at the same time, at the Speakers' Corner?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

And indeed  when  your\r\n\r\nspeech  is  a rousing one, people may support you.   But  you\r\n\r\ncannot be said to be organising an illegal assembly.

The PTC conducts regular audits of the services\r\n\r\nprovided  by the public transport operators to measure  their\r\n\r\nlevel  of  compliance to these guidelines.  In addition,  the\r\n\r\nPTC  and the LTA encourage bus operators to introduce new and\r\n\r\ninnovative  schemes  to  improve  the  quality  of   customer\r\n\r\nservice,  provided that these schemes do not have an  adverse\r\n\r\nimpact   on  safety  and  basic  service  level  offered   to\r\n\r\ncommuters.\r\n\r\n.    The TV Mobile scheme does not affect basic service level\r\n\r\nprovided by the bus operator.  The TV monitors would not pose\r\n\r\na danger to the passengers, hinder the movement of passengers\r\n\r\nin  the  bus and/or affect the concentration of the  drivers.\r\n\r\nThe  bus operator will also not be exposed to undue financial\r\n\r\nrisk.

We  are  aware  of  the discomfort  expressed  by  some\r\n\r\ncommuters regarding the presence of the TV Mobile monitors in\r\n\r\nthe  buses  since its launch on 14th February 2001.  We  have\r\n\r\nasked  the  bus company and Media Corp to improve the  system\r\n\r\nand  they are currently looking into adjusting the volume and\r\n\r\nimproving  on the quality of the images.

Unlike the Budget and off-Budget\r\n\r\nstatements in 1998 and 1999, when painful and belt-tightening\r\n\r\nmeasures had to be introduced to combat the recession and the\r\n\r\nadverse  impact  of the regional financial crisis,  in  sharp\r\n\r\ncontrast,  this  year's  Budget is a  happy  one.   The  only\r\n\r\nproblem,   I   think,  Dr  Richard  Hu  and  his  Ministerial\r\n\r\ncolleagues had was how to share out and apportion the goodies\r\n\r\nthat a healthy Government budget can enable them to dole  out\r\n\r\nto the different segments of the population.  For FY2000, the\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus  is  expected to increase from  the  original\r\n\r\nestimate of $2.4 billion to $3.5 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is indeed an extremely generous one.\r\n\r\nThe Finance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister  has given out benefits to practically  everyone  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Allow  me to quickly recount some  of  the  very\r\n\r\ngenerous benefits doled out.  There are the significant  2-5%\r\n\r\ncuts in personal income tax.  Then there is the unexpected 1%\r\n\r\ncut  in corporate tax, following a 1/2% cut already given out\r\n\r\nlast  year.   Small  businesses are given partial  tax-exempt\r\n\r\nbenefit  for  chargeable incomes of up to $100,000.   To  top\r\n\r\noff, the Government is giving a 10% rebate on personal income\r\n\r\ntax.   This is more generous compared to the 5% rebate  given\r\n\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other benefits that touch deeper into the hearts of\r\n\r\nthe  lower income group is the Service and Conservancy  (S&C)\r\n\r\ncharges,  rentals and utilities rebates to various households\r\n\r\nliving  in  HDB  estates.  Then there is the additional  $500\r\n\r\nmillion  contribution  into the Lifelong  Learning  Endowment\r\n\r\nFund,  an additional $250 million to the ElderCare Fund,  and\r\n\r\n$100  million to the Medical Endowment Fund.  These are  very\r\n\r\ngratifying   benefits  indeed.   These  and  other   benefits\r\n\r\nannounced brought great cheers to the people. What  is  worth\r\n\r\nnoting is that the benefits are biased in favour of the lower\r\n\r\nincome group and the smaller firms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in spite of the excellent benefits, I do feel\r\n\r\nthat  there are areas in which the Government can perhaps  do\r\n\r\nmore,  or  be more proactive to anticipate potential  problem\r\n\r\nareas, and detail the possible remedial actions.\r\n\r\nUncertainty of External Economic Developments\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister did make general broad brush\r\n\r\nreviews of the regional and international economic situation.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  feel  what is lacking are some clear  statements\r\n\r\nstressing  the likely problem areas in the short  and  medium\r\n\r\nterm.   We are concerned about the worsening US economy.   We\r\n\r\nwatch  with  dismay  the geo-political  developments  in  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries,  like  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,\r\n\r\nThailand,  Japan, Malaysia and elsewhere.  The  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, BG Lee Hsien\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nLoong,  has  warned about the tough external  environment  as\r\n\r\nmentioned in last Friday's newspaper reports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister said that given the current\r\n\r\npolitical and economic uncertainties in South-east Asia,  the\r\n\r\nexternal   environment  Singapore  now  faces  is  the   most\r\n\r\ndifficult  since  the  1960s.  He warned  that  any  regional\r\n\r\npolitical  turmoil  would have direct  impact  on  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThese  are  strong statements and a very realistic and  sober\r\n\r\nassessment of the current economic situation.  Then,  why  is\r\n\r\nit  that the Budget Statement for this year did not dwell  on\r\n\r\nthis  matter in depth?  Why are no comments made  on  how  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  a potential crisis if another regional crisis  or\r\n\r\nturmoil  were to precipitate?  We are fortunate that  through\r\n\r\nsound  management of the economy, we have escaped the  recent\r\n\r\ncrisis  in  a  sharp \"V\" shape recovery. The people  and  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community  are  indeed  very  concerned   about   a\r\n\r\nrecurrence of the recession, meaning a \"W\" shape downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose the Finance Minister will respond that when\r\n\r\nthe  time comes, he will deal with it, and propose off-budget\r\n\r\nmeasures.   This  is  not a very comfortable  approach.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore Government is known for its practice of looking far\r\n\r\nahead, anticipating problems and planning in advance.  As the\r\n\r\nChinese    saying    goes:    wei    yu    chou     mou     (\r\n\r\n),  which means to close the windows and the doors before the\r\n\r\nrain comes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this time round, the Budget did not\r\n\r\nmention  these preparations.  Are we getting too  comfortable\r\n\r\nand  too  smug?   I do not think so.  One explanation  I  can\r\n\r\noffer is that talking about a potential downturn may not  fit\r\n\r\nin  the tone of the Finance Minister's Budget speech for this\r\n\r\nyear;  that  things  are  good, let us  come  and  share  the\r\n\r\ngoodies, and let us worry about the rain later.  Whatever are\r\n\r\nhis  reasons, I do feel that it would indeed give the  people\r\n\r\nmore  comfort  that even in good times, we are reminded  that\r\n\r\nour  Government is prepared for any unforeseen  eventualities\r\n\r\nahead.  Similarly,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit would bolster the confidence of foreign investors that the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government is very alert and mindful  of  external\r\n\r\neventualities, and is constantly thinking and planning ahead.\r\n\r\nWe  definitely  are.   This  is  the  trademark  of  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nCollaboration with the Countries in the Region\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that the region is going through a\r\n\r\ndifficult transitional period.  I say \"transitional\"  because\r\n\r\nI  am  confident  that the leaders in the regional  countries\r\n\r\nwill eventually overcome their problems.  Since we are living\r\n\r\nin  a  difficult  neighbourhood and  we  cannot  just  uproot\r\n\r\nourselves  and move elsewhere, it is necessary therefore  for\r\n\r\nus to find ways to help our neighbours to get out of the rut,\r\n\r\nso to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the direct bilateral assistance that we are\r\n\r\ndoing,  there may well be other methods for us to  help  each\r\n\r\nother,  for our mutual benefit.  One way is to use the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nframework to do joint trade and investment promotions to  the\r\n\r\nWestern  economies.   Collectively, the  economic  and  trade\r\n\r\nMinisters  of ASEAN countries can work together  to  persuade\r\n\r\nthe  MNCs  in  the developed countries that this region  (ie,\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  Thailand and others)  are  still  good\r\n\r\ninvestment  areas in view of the low overheads  and  abundant\r\n\r\nlabour  supply.   Singapore  can  help  to  facilitate   this\r\n\r\nprocess,  if  we  can  undertake joint trade  and  investment\r\n\r\npromotions.  If foreign investors return to this region,  the\r\n\r\neconomic recovery will be hastened.\r\n\r\nLeap-frogging the Region\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we work hand in glove with our neighbours to\r\n\r\nattract  foreign  investors,  it  is  also  beneficial   that\r\n\r\nSingapore makes direct approach to countries beyond ASEAN  to\r\n\r\nencourage them to invest here.  In this instance, our move to\r\n\r\nestablish bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) is a step in\r\n\r\nthe  right direction.  The FTAs will encourage the strong and\r\n\r\nsuccessful\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompanies in the foreign countries to seriously explore trade\r\n\r\nand investment opportunities with Singapore.  In the process,\r\n\r\nthey can be encouraged to cast their eyes wider, and look  at\r\n\r\nother investment opportunities in our neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\nAt  least,  we  can hope that through their  attention  being\r\n\r\nattracted  to  Singapore and by casting  their  eyes  in  our\r\n\r\ndirection, the region will also enter their \"radar screen\" of\r\n\r\nthese foreign investors as areas of investments.\r\n\r\nPromotion of Nation Building\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the main task of the Budget to plan and allocate\r\n\r\nresources  for  the  economic  development  of  the  country,\r\n\r\nanother major objective of the yearly Budgets is to apportion\r\n\r\nGovernment  spending  and  resources  to  match  the  broader\r\n\r\nobjective of nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recently completed year 2000 survey of household\r\n\r\nincome showed that over the last 10-year period from 1990  to\r\n\r\n2000,  the  household income gap of Singaporeans has  widened\r\n\r\nfurther.   The national average monthly income of the  lowest\r\n\r\n10%  wage  earners dropped from $370 in 1990 to only  $61  in\r\n\r\n2000.   In  contrast, the national average monthly income  of\r\n\r\nthe  top  10% wage earners increased from $9,670 in  1990  to\r\n\r\n$16,800 in 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, there has been a widening in the income gap\r\n\r\nbetween  the  rich  and the poor.  As I  recall,  the  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, commented before that this is like\r\n\r\na  marathon race by all Singaporeans, starting back  when  we\r\n\r\nfirst  gained our independence.  As we progress and  prosper,\r\n\r\nthe  gap  between  the forerunners and the stragglers  behind\r\n\r\ngets longer and longer.   This is inevitable.  We cannot stop\r\n\r\nthe  race and start all over again.  We also cannot tell  the\r\n\r\nforerunners to run slower to wait for those behind  to  catch\r\n\r\nup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong's call\r\n\r\nover  the weekend to the people not to fret over this  income\r\n\r\ngap.  Firstly, everybody's income has increased,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  an  average of $3,080 per month in 1990 to  $4,940  per\r\n\r\nmonth  in 2000.  The Prime Minister has explained that wealth\r\n\r\nis  not  confined to a privileged minority at the expense  of\r\n\r\nthe  majority.  There are opportunities for all.   Wealth  is\r\n\r\nredistributed through measures introduced during the  Budget,\r\n\r\nand  Government has programmes to reach out and help the poor\r\n\r\nand needy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to what the Government can do is to provide\r\n\r\neveryone   a  sound  education  so  that  every  Singaporean,\r\n\r\nwhatever  are  his abilities, can run a good  race  and  earn\r\n\r\nenough  rewards to have a decent and useful  life.   For  the\r\n\r\nones  with  potential, we provide scholarships and bursaries,\r\n\r\nat  all levels, to lift them to higher heights.  Another task\r\n\r\nof  the  Government is to lessen the burdens that the  people\r\n\r\nhave  to  carry  in  the race, and at the same  time  provide\r\n\r\nsupplements and assistance programmes along the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I can say that Singapore has scored top\r\n\r\ngrade  \"A\"  in  its  mission  of nation  building.   We  have\r\n\r\nprovided one of the best educational systems in the world, an\r\n\r\nenvy  of  many  others.  Our students scored high  grades  in\r\n\r\ninternational mathematics and science tests.  They have  done\r\n\r\nwell in top universities around the world.  They achieved top\r\n\r\nhonours in international oratorical debates.  We have a  low,\r\n\r\nbut   simple   and  effective  tax  regime.    Huge   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments continue to flow in.  We have substantial foreign\r\n\r\nreserves.   And  we have consistently achieved high  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth and healthy budget surpluses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I particularly welcome are the various funds to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  poor  and under-privileged.  We have  the  Medical\r\n\r\nEndowment   Fund  and  ElderCare  Fund.   Another  worthwhile\r\n\r\nprogramme  is  the Lifelong Learning Endowment  Fund.   These\r\n\r\nfunds  are very meaningful.   They help the poor and  elderly\r\n\r\nto  pay  for their medical and hospitalisation bills if  they\r\n\r\ncannot afford it.  The other fund helps the older workers  to\r\n\r\nbe  trained  and  retrained so that they  can  adapt  to  the\r\n\r\nchanging technological environment in the work place.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what more can be done? Actually, not much more,\r\n\r\nsince there are so many plans already thought out and put  in\r\n\r\nplace   by  the  Government.   However,  I  do  have  a   few\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nGrassroots Fund for Community Groups\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to suggest that we establish a\r\n\r\nGrassroots  Support Fund which grassroots  organisations  can\r\n\r\ntap  on  to do more activities for their task to support  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   plan  towards  nation-building  and   building\r\n\r\nstronger  community  ties.   I would  say  that  even  if  we\r\n\r\nallocate  a  lowly  sum  of $100,000  per  constituency,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  needs only to put aside $8.3 million  yearly  for\r\n\r\nall  the  83 constituencies, as a fund for grassroots leaders\r\n\r\nto help finance their projects.  Currently, I do say that the\r\n\r\nlack of ready availability of money does put a constraint  on\r\n\r\nthe  scale  and the quantity of projects and activities  that\r\n\r\ngrassroots  bodies  like the Residents'  Committees  and  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Clubs can organise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact that important community groups like the\r\n\r\nResidents'  Committees  in HDB estates  are  formed  with  no\r\n\r\ndirect  funding  support from the Government.   Often,  while\r\n\r\nthey  devote  much  time to organise activities  to  draw  in\r\n\r\nresidents,  they  also  have to raise  their  own  funds  for\r\n\r\nactivities  and  projects.  When  they  have  to  source  for\r\n\r\ndonations  from local residents or shopkeepers, or  undertake\r\n\r\nmajor  fund raising project exercises, these efforts  can  be\r\n\r\nlaborious,  energy sapping and time consuming.  I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  unfair to our dedicated and hardworking  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders.   Lack  of  funds should not  be  a  constraint  for\r\n\r\ngrassroots groups to do more.  They should be freed from time\r\n\r\nspent  on fund raising, so that they can channel more  energy\r\n\r\ntowards  organising activities and promoting neighbourliness.\r\n\r\nThe  grassroots bodies are important elements in the  nation-building process.  It is time that due recognition should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  them by allocating them sufficient basic funds  so\r\n\r\nthat  they can be more effective in their efforts.  The money\r\n\r\nis   affordable.    To  ensure  that  the  money   is   spent\r\n\r\nmeaningfully, we can allow the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadvisers of the grassroots organisations to manage and decide\r\n\r\nhow the funds can be used.\r\n\r\nReward for Pensioners\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area where I feel strongly that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  do more is the recognition and  rewards  for\r\n\r\npensioners.   The retired Government pensioners are  a  group\r\n\r\nthat  has  toiled  quietly and faithfully to  help  build  up\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Many of them spent their entire  career  in  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service.  During the old days when Singapore was  less\r\n\r\nwell-off,  civil  servants on pension scheme  generally  drew\r\n\r\nlower  salaries  compared  to  their  contemporaries  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.  It was just an honour to serve.  Salary  was\r\n\r\nnot  the  key consideration.  Things have changed  since  the\r\n\r\npension  scheme  has  been  modified  where  most  Government\r\n\r\nservants  are  switched  to  full  CPF  payments,  and  civil\r\n\r\nservants' salaries are matched to the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the pool of retired civil service\r\n\r\npensioners, many are trying to survive and make ends meet  on\r\n\r\ntheir  lowly  meagre pensions.  They see the  fruits  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic pie which they have helped to build being shared out\r\n\r\nin  the  recent years, but they get nothing or  very  little.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the pensions are eroded in value through inflation\r\n\r\nand  increase in the cost of living.  Not many  of  them  are\r\n\r\ncomplaining.  You do not see many letters to the press.   But\r\n\r\nI  think during the good times like now, it is important that\r\n\r\nthis lot of past contributors is not forgotten.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's Budget, the Finance Minister has made an\r\n\r\nattempt  to  provide  something for the pensioners.   He  has\r\n\r\nincreased  the Singapore Allowance by $10 to $150  per  month\r\n\r\nand  increased the gross pension ceiling from $950 to  $1,050\r\n\r\nper  month.   This  revision  will  cost  the  Government  an\r\n\r\nadditional $1.7 million.  I wish to lament that this  sum  of\r\n\r\n$1.7  million  is  rather  paltry.  Compared  to  the  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus  expected  for financial year 2000 of  $3.5  billion,\r\n\r\nthis  is  only 0.0005%, or less than half of a 1,000th  of  a\r\n\r\npercent.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I quietly plead to the Finance Minister, on the\r\n\r\npensioners'  behalf,  to  ask  that  some  form  of  a   more\r\n\r\nsubstantial  adjustment be considered so that the  pensioners\r\n\r\nare  also amply rewarded.  I am not asking for a formula  for\r\n\r\ninflation indexation scheme to constantly adjust pensions for\r\n\r\ninflation.  But an ad hoc review may be a kind and thoughtful\r\n\r\ngesture.  Sadly, this year's Budget cannot be said to be  the\r\n\r\nmost  generous  to  the  pensioners.  I  sincerely  hope  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister will sympathise with this appeal.\r\n\r\nRaising Living Costs and Business Costs\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your indulgence, I like to speak on two\r\n\r\nremaining  areas that I wish to raise in this Budget  debate.\r\n\r\nIt  is a constant refrain from both the common people and the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community, that is the call to help contain  rising\r\n\r\ncosts of living and costs of doing business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that with rising affluence, living\r\n\r\ncosts  and  business costs are bound to increase.   What  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  the  business  sector  are  asking  is  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to refrain from imposing more charges,  rates  and\r\n\r\nfees  on  them.  For example, the low income group is  facing\r\n\r\ndifficulty with the recent increase in utility charges due to\r\n\r\noil  price  increases.  Their income is  falling  behind  the\r\n\r\nincrease in cost of living.  For FY2000, the expected  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus is a hefty $3.5 billion.  For FY2001, this surplus is\r\n\r\nexpected to increase further to $4.4 billion.  That means the\r\n\r\nGovernment is collecting more revenue than it needs  for  its\r\n\r\nyearly total expenditures.  Surely there is no need to  raise\r\n\r\nGovernment charges and fees.  On the contrary, more reduction\r\n\r\nin taxes, rates and fees may be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the low income group are the people\r\n\r\nfalling  behind the wage gap between the rich and  the  poor.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  must continue to find  ways  to  help  them.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  they may feel left behind and become  disgruntled\r\n\r\nor  disillusioned that they are not enjoying a share  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry's  economic wealth.  Their only hope is to  see  that\r\n\r\ntheir  children  do  well  in their studies,  and  they  look\r\n\r\nforward\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the days when their children can secure good jobs, attain\r\n\r\ngood  stead  in  their  careers.   Therefore,  education  and\r\n\r\nretraining is the great opportunity equalisation factor.   We\r\n\r\nmust  ensure  that everyone has good access to education  and\r\n\r\nretraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the business community, they are concerned and\r\n\r\ndisappointed that this year's Budget did not address or  even\r\n\r\nmention  how to contain the threat of rising business  costs.\r\n\r\nAlthough the overall economy has grown by 9.9% in 2000,  many\r\n\r\nlocal  businesses  have  not fully recovered  from  the  1998\r\n\r\nrecession.    Good  examples  are  the  retailers   and   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  sector.   They  are still  facing  insufficient\r\n\r\nbusiness demand, high business costs, high labour, utilities,\r\n\r\nrental  and other costs.  A survey recently conducted by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Confederation of Industries  (SCI)  has  confirmed\r\n\r\nthat  most  local businesses are still concerned  about  poor\r\n\r\nbusiness  prospects  and rising business  costs.   Even  MNCs\r\n\r\nbased   in  Singapore  are  becoming  concerned  about  these\r\n\r\nbusiness cost increases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of corporate tax by 1% is welcome, no\r\n\r\ndoubt.  However, companies can only enjoy the tax cut if they\r\n\r\nmake  a  profit.  If they are not profitable, the tax cut  is\r\n\r\nnot  meaningful.  Therefore, reducing cost of doing  business\r\n\r\nis  still the best and most direct to them.  The only measure\r\n\r\nin  the  Budget that helps to reduce business  costs  is  the\r\n\r\nreduction  in  property tax rate from 12% to  10%.   However,\r\n\r\nexcept for the residential sector, this effect is negated  by\r\n\r\nthe  withdrawal of the 25% property tax rebate.   Mr  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister, you gave out with one hand and took back  with  the\r\n\r\nother hand.  Some may cry foul.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To contain business costs, companies wish to request for\r\n\r\na  slowdown in the restoration of the employers' contribution\r\n\r\nrate  to 20%.  The rate has already been restored to 16% from\r\n\r\nJanuary 2001.  It is appreciated that workers have taken  the\r\n\r\n10%  CPF cut to help lower business cost and help revive  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   However,  many companies are  concerned  that  too\r\n\r\nrapid a restoration of the employers' CPF contribution to the\r\n\r\nfull 20% will stall their business recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the business community would like to urge the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  make  a  determined effort  to  help  contain\r\n\r\nbusiness costs.  They hope that with the flexibility  of  the\r\n\r\nlarger  budget surplus, the Government can do a comprehensive\r\n\r\nreview  of  Government  administered charges,  such  as  port\r\n\r\ncharges,  land  transportation  cost,  ERP,  utilities,  COE,\r\n\r\nlevies,  and other duties, so that operating costs should  be\r\n\r\nkept as low as possible.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to repeat\r\n\r\nthat this year's Budget is an extremely generous Budget.   We\r\n\r\nwish to thank the Minister for Finance and his colleagues for\r\n\r\ngiving  us so many benefits and rewards.  As he has  said  in\r\n\r\nhis Budget speech, this year's package of \"share-outs\" is the\r\n\r\nmost  generous  to  date (except to the pensioners  perhaps).\r\n\r\nThis  sharing-out  is possible because of the  effective  and\r\n\r\nprudent Government we have.  It is especially significant  in\r\n\r\nthe  face  of the turmoils we see in the surrounding  region.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  will  continue to build  substantial  budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses.   Next  year's budget surplus is  expected  to  be\r\n\r\nhigher,  as  I  said earlier, at $4.4 billion.   If  this  is\r\n\r\nachieved,  we would be pleased that some of this  surplus  is\r\n\r\nshared  out with the people, and the balance is put into  our\r\n\r\nnational reserves as a cushion against future uncertainties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, uncertainties and changes we are sure\r\n\r\nto  face  them, now and in the future.  In my view, the  best\r\n\r\nsafeguard is not how big our reserves are, but the key is  to\r\n\r\nhave an effective and honest Government.  That is the one and\r\n\r\nonly surest safeguard.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance has presented what most would regard  as\r\n\r\nthe  most  generous Budget to-date.  I rise  to  applaud  the\r\n\r\npositive  intent on both the business and individual  fronts.\r\n\r\nI  would  however  want  to  look  at  the  Budget  from  two\r\n\r\nperspectives.   Firstly, to look beyond the goodies,  at  the\r\n\r\nmaterial  changes to, (1) the business environment,  and  (2)\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsharing  of  more of the fruits of our labour in  Singapore's\r\n\r\ngrowth.   And, secondly, to be vigilant about the development\r\n\r\nof a psychological divide amongst Singaporeans from the rapid\r\n\r\npace  of  change  from  the extensive  application  of  ever-changing   technology   and  increasing   liberalisation   or\r\n\r\nderegulation of certain industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on material changes. Sir, the lowering of the\r\n\r\ncorporate tax rate by 1% point and personal income tax  rates\r\n\r\nby  between  2  and  5%  points is a very  significant  move.\r\n\r\nEqually  significant  is  the exemption  scheme  for  smaller\r\n\r\nchargeable  incomes which will benefit the small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises  (or  SMEs),  and to a certain  extent  companies\r\n\r\ngoing through a bad patch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that, in earlier years, there was a concern\r\n\r\nthat lowering our corporate tax rate below the 25% level  may\r\n\r\nlead  to Singapore being classified as a tax haven.  I am  by\r\n\r\nno means suggesting that we forgo the opportunity to make our\r\n\r\ntax regime more competitive but I would like to know why this\r\n\r\nis  no  longer  a  concern.  Also, if this  is  no  longer  a\r\n\r\nconstraint, how much lower can we go?  As low as Hong Kong's?\r\n\r\nCan  the  Minister also discuss the implications  of  further\r\n\r\nreductions  in direct taxes for the level of indirect  taxes,\r\n\r\nsuch as the goods and services tax?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the gap between the top income tax rate and\r\n\r\ncorporate tax rate has narrowed by 1% point.  I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the Minister whether there is any intention to harmonise\r\n\r\nthe two in the context of entrepreneurship and start-ups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the reduction in income tax rates across the board,\r\n\r\npresumably  the tax base, in terms of persons  paying  taxes,\r\n\r\nwill  shrink  further.  Will this limit the effectiveness  of\r\n\r\nincome   tax   adjustments  as  a  fiscal  tool  in   future?\r\n\r\nSpecifically, will wealth sharing through tax rebates be less\r\n\r\nwide-reaching as a consequence?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the development of a psychological\r\n\r\ndivide.  In his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBudget Statement, the Minister has commented on the need  for\r\n\r\nboth  the  Government and Singaporeans to  adapt  quickly  to\r\n\r\nchanges and that we must continue to be mindful of our  local\r\n\r\ncontext.  I cannot agree more, for the ability to embrace and\r\n\r\nadapt  to  trends and changes by Singaporeans will indeed  be\r\n\r\nkey to our survival.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in this context that I am concerned - that we\r\n\r\nare facilitating changes but may not have done enough to help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   embrace  changes,  many  of  which   are   not\r\n\r\nimmediately  obvious.   It  is this psychological  battle  or\r\n\r\ndivide which, I feel, merits a lot more attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about the wealth and digital\r\n\r\ndivides  which  are largely the consequences of globalisation\r\n\r\nand  use of technology.  My colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, has\r\n\r\nspoken  at  length on the wealth divide.  I should  also  add\r\n\r\nthat  much has been done to narrow the digital divide by  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  Ministries,  especially the Ministry  of  Manpower,\r\n\r\nMTI,  MCIT  and  the  NTUC,  in  terms  of  putting  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in  place and for a wide range  of  workers.   In\r\n\r\naggregate,  the Government has dedicated serious  money,  for\r\n\r\nexample, $500 million to the lifelong learning initiative for\r\n\r\ntraining and retraining and cannot be accused of not  funding\r\n\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the digital divide, in terms of the haves\r\n\r\nand have-nots to access to computers and technology, learning\r\n\r\nand retraining, cannot be addressed simply by pumping in more\r\n\r\nmoney or providing even more training programmes.  A part  of\r\n\r\nthe budget for such programmes must be allocated to extensive\r\n\r\npublic  education  and reaching out to the  target  audience,\r\n\r\nworking  through the grassroots and community  organisations,\r\n\r\nwhere  necessary.  The psychological divide must be  narrowed\r\n\r\nfirst before the digital divide can be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same attention must be paid to persons, who are\r\n\r\naffected   by   realignments  to  our   economy,   be   these\r\n\r\ndisplacement of jobs, liberalisation or deregulation effects.\r\n\r\nSir, this is not unique to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nJapan  is  being  confronted with a  structural  unemployment\r\n\r\nchallenge,  which is caused by both a mismatch in skills  and\r\n\r\nresistance  to taking on alternative jobs.  In this  context,\r\n\r\ncan more proactive efforts be made to identify the vulnerable\r\n\r\nindustries  and counselling be provided as early as  possible\r\n\r\nso  that  workers are mentally prepared for the  need  to  be\r\n\r\nretrained?   In  any case, as it is highly  conceivable  that\r\n\r\ncontract  employment  is likely to dominate  in  future,  the\r\n\r\nsooner Singaporeans modify their mindsets, the more adaptable\r\n\r\nto  change they will be.  The more we can minimise the sudden\r\n\r\nshock  of  being  retrenched, the more  willing  to  consider\r\n\r\nalternatives  will  Singaporeans be.  Moreover,  our  limited\r\n\r\nmanpower  resources mean that we can ill-afford to  lose  the\r\n\r\ncontribution of any segment of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for adapting to the necessary or desirable\r\n\r\nliberalisation  or deregulation of certain industries,  there\r\n\r\nis anecdotal evidence that some degree of public education is\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans have complained bitterly about being\r\n\r\ninconvenienced  by  bank branch closures,  particularly,  the\r\n\r\nPOSBank  branches that have served them for many years.   But\r\n\r\nis  this  rationalisation of branch network unique to POSBank\r\n\r\nor  DBS?  No, it is not.  All the other local banks are  also\r\n\r\nrationalising.   Or  for  that  matter,  is  it   unique   to\r\n\r\nSingaporean  banks?   Again, it is not.   I  understand  that\r\n\r\ncustomers  in  the  UK  and New Zealand are  raising  similar\r\n\r\nobjections.   Should  the banks have  done  more  to  educate\r\n\r\ncustomers  on the impending changes, which are really  driven\r\n\r\nby  competitive forces, not purely from a Singaporean context\r\n\r\nbut  from  a global perspective?  Yes, individual  banks,  or\r\n\r\nperhaps even the Association of Banks, could have embarked on\r\n\r\na  public  education  programme to  pave  the  way  for  more\r\n\r\nelectronic   banking   as  opposed   to   branch-based   cash\r\n\r\ntransactions.   Advice on alternative arrangements,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  provision of cash-deposit machines, or directions to the\r\n\r\nnearest  shopping mall, well ahead of the closure could  have\r\n\r\nmade the transition easier.  Where the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchanges  are  sweeping,  in terms of their  impact  on  daily\r\n\r\nlives,  even  the Government can help play a role  in  public\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me end by making a similar request to the\r\n\r\nGovernment to ensure that sufficient resources are set  aside\r\n\r\nfor  public  education on the impending deregulation  of  the\r\n\r\nenergy or electricity market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Trade and Industry has indicated that,\r\n\r\neventually  even  the retail segment of electricity  will  be\r\n\r\ncompletely  liberalised,  implying that  market  forces  will\r\n\r\ndetermine  tariffs,  as opposed to a quarterly  review  right\r\n\r\nnow.   A  complete  pass-through of costs will  no  doubt  be\r\n\r\ntransparent  and  defensible  but  Singaporeans  need  to  be\r\n\r\nmentally prepared for an exposure to an occasionally volatile\r\n\r\noil  market,  such  as  the phenomenon experienced  recently.\r\n\r\nMore  importantly, they need to be able to take into  account\r\n\r\npossible swings in their household budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy as\r\n\r\noutlined by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, in 1996, we had\r\n\r\nan  election budget.  That year was an election  year.   This\r\n\r\ntime  round,  again, we have essentially an election  budget.\r\n\r\nIt  is  quite foreseeable that the general election shall  be\r\n\r\nheld  either  this year or early next year, before  the  next\r\n\r\nBudget Day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister this year has been much more generous than\r\n\r\nin  1996.  With the election year in mind, the benefits  have\r\n\r\nbeen  mainly  aimed  at  the  individual,  such  as  the  tax\r\n\r\nreduction,  rebates  in  service  and  conservancy   charges,\r\n\r\nrentals and utilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the tax breaks may not be really beneficial as\r\n\r\nabout  71% of the workers are not paying income tax  at  all,\r\n\r\nthere are good reasons for the Minister to be generous.   The\r\n\r\nworkers  have given their full cooperation in the 1998  cost-cutting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeasures to revive the economy, after it was hit by the Asian\r\n\r\ncrisis.  Singapore suffered two years of recession, beginning\r\n\r\nabout  July  1997.  In respect of the cost-cutting  measures,\r\n\r\nthe workers were at the forefront in those steps taken to cut\r\n\r\ncosts.   They sacrificed a 10-percentage point cut  in  their\r\n\r\nCPF.   Even up till today, full restoration of their CPF  has\r\n\r\nnot  come about yet.  Despite the generosity of the Minister,\r\n\r\nworkers have given up more of their pay in terms of their CPF\r\n\r\ncut than what they shall be receiving in the Budget handouts.\r\n\r\nThe  workers therefore deserve this generous budget.  Up till\r\n\r\nnow,  each  of the workers has put in his national  sacrifice\r\n\r\nand he suffers in silence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are forecasts that, this year, the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy shall be slowing down.  It is therefore good  to  put\r\n\r\nmore  money  in  the hands of the HDB flat  dwellers.   I  am\r\n\r\nthinking of the poor state of the retail business in the  HDB\r\n\r\nheartland,  as  mentioned recently by Dr Lily Neo,  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kreta Ayer-Tanglin GRC.  With the  $1.8  billion\r\n\r\nhandout,  it is hoped that much of it shall be spent  in  the\r\n\r\nlocal  HDB shops, to give those shops some business  to  keep\r\n\r\nthem  alive  and the ability to pay their HDB  shop  rentals.\r\n\r\nThose  rentals  shall largely be returning to the  Government\r\n\r\nkitty in any event.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recession came in 1997. The following year, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  put  in place cost-cutting measures.   The  cost-cutting measures comprise mainly cutting the workers'  salary\r\n\r\nin  the  form  of  CPF and the flexi component  part  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers'  pay.  The reduction in wage was mainly  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  keeping the economy afloat.  Singapore's economy  pulled\r\n\r\nthrough  the recession and recovered.  Last year,  it  had  a\r\n\r\nsurplus of about $4.36 billion, after the deduction of  $1.85\r\n\r\nbillion for the special transfers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every year, Singapore has a surplus in its\r\n\r\nBudget.   All  surpluses are transferred to the reserves  and\r\n\r\ninvested.  Those reserves are not used up for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe people.  Dr Kanwaljit Soin,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  NMP,  in 1996, during the Budget debate, suggested  that\r\n\r\nthe  budget surpluses be used in accordance with a  framework\r\n\r\nshe proposed.  The Minister, of course, refused and said that\r\n\r\nthe proposal of using the budget according to a framework was\r\n\r\ntoo rigid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that more money be released from the\r\n\r\nsurpluses,  say, about $2 billion for a start,  to  make  our\r\n\r\neducation system the best in the world.  In the initial year,\r\n\r\nmore  money is needed to build more schools to keep the class\r\n\r\nsize  small.  My hope is that every Singaporean, by the  time\r\n\r\nhe   leaves  school,  shall  be  equipped  with  the  English\r\n\r\nLanguage.   He  must be able to understand, to  read  and  to\r\n\r\nwrite properly that language.  Without a working knowledge of\r\n\r\nEnglish, our workers shall not be able to be trained to  keep\r\n\r\nup  with the knowledge-based economy.  That is the problem of\r\n\r\na  large  number of our workforce today.  They lack a working\r\n\r\nknowledge of English and, for that reason, the great  efforts\r\n\r\nput in by the Government and the NTUC seem to be getting very\r\n\r\nlittle results.  If we want Singapore to go into the ranks of\r\n\r\nthe  developed countries, both in terms of per capita  income\r\n\r\nand  in  social ranking, we must make sure that every one  of\r\n\r\nour  workers  is  properly  educated.   I  say  that  it   is\r\n\r\nworthwhile for us to use our accumulated surpluses  for  that\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget Statement delivered by the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance.   I am especially heartened by the Government's\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  creating  the  best  conditions  for  private\r\n\r\nenterprise to flourish in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our founding by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819,\r\n\r\npeople  from  many countries, from different walks  of  life,\r\n\r\nhave come to Singapore in search of opportunities.  They have\r\n\r\ncome  in  search  of a better life for themselves  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.   To many, this means being here to make  a  decent\r\n\r\nliving and to create\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwealth.   After  all, we are not an island to  the  south  of\r\n\r\nHawaii,  where  people chose to retire to, or to  while  away\r\n\r\ntheir days under a coconut tree.  Singapore has always been a\r\n\r\nhighly competitive commercial hub for businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it is business that draws foreign people to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and retains local talents to work and  live  here.\r\n\r\nIf  Singapore  is a backwater economy with few  opportunities\r\n\r\nfor advancement, talent, which is mobile, will take flight to\r\n\r\nseek out opportunities elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this globalised world, a highly qualified and\r\n\r\ndisciplined  workforce, brought about by good  education  and\r\n\r\ntraining, is important but not sufficient by itself to ensure\r\n\r\nour  continued success.  As Mr Leong Horn Kee has pointed out\r\n\r\njust  now,  we  have  a  very sound and  effective  education\r\n\r\nsystem.   Our young achieved the best scores for science  and\r\n\r\nmathematics.  In a recent international ranking, our students\r\n\r\ncame out tops.  Last year, out of 12,192 students who sat for\r\n\r\nthe \"A\" levels, 1,251 students (or more than 10%) scored four\r\n\r\nAs.   They  move  on to do very well in foreign universities,\r\n\r\noften   coming  up  tops  in  their  class.   But  if   after\r\n\r\ngraduation,  they decide to remain and work  in  London,  New\r\n\r\nYork  or  Hong Kong and never return, how would that  benefit\r\n\r\nus?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore must not merely be a training centre for the\r\n\r\nworld.   We must not merely be the school that produces  good\r\n\r\nstudents, nor merely an institution that churns out efficient\r\n\r\nand  diligent  workers  for  foreign  employers  to  recruit.\r\n\r\nAlready,  this  is  happening.   Foreign  hospitals  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  to look for good qualified nurses.  Foreign  firms\r\n\r\nwoo   our  best  and  brightest  research  engineers.    More\r\n\r\nconducive  business  conditions  elsewhere  tempt  our   most\r\n\r\npromising entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge, ideas and talents are highly mobile. These\r\n\r\nare  mobile  because they reside in the heads of people,  who\r\n\r\nare  mobile.  When a person is attracted to move to a foreign\r\n\r\nland  with better opportunities, his knowledge, ideas, skills\r\n\r\nand talents go with him.  But capital - our own\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmoney,  our own national reserves - does not move unless  and\r\n\r\nuntil  we decide to move it.  Ultimately, we decide where  to\r\n\r\nmove  and  deploy  our money.  We should  therefore  use  our\r\n\r\nfinancial assets to strategically seek out and attract  other\r\n\r\npeople's  knowledge, ideas and talents, and retain  our  own.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  feel that the guardians and managers of our  capital\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  creative enough to use the  funds  at  their\r\n\r\ndisposal  to attract and retain talent.  More can and  should\r\n\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that this year's budget contains a lot of\r\n\r\nmeasures  to stimulate the business sector and to  allow  new\r\n\r\nindustries to mushroom and thrive.  This is a good sign  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  concerned  about  how to make  sure  that  homegrown\r\n\r\nbusinesses  can  flourish.  We should not just  be  concerned\r\n\r\nabout  training Singaporeans and foreigners so that they  can\r\n\r\nmake  it in the world beyond our land.  We want them to  make\r\n\r\nit right here within our fair shores.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need is to make commercial room so that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can be successful entrepreneurs  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  will  be another root to bind good people here  to  our\r\n\r\nland.   It will help us deal with the very present danger  of\r\n\r\nlosing these good people to a digital, globalised world  -  a\r\n\r\nworld  that  does not subscribe to the concept of \"Our  Home,\r\n\r\nOur Nation.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurs are more invested in a country than\r\n\r\nprofessionals, who just offer their services to  the  highest\r\n\r\nbidder  anywhere in the world.  Entrepreneurs  will  be  more\r\n\r\nengaged  and  concerned  about  local  issues,  because   the\r\n\r\nbusiness  they own is at stake.  We need to give  such  local\r\n\r\ntalented trained Singaporeans the business conditions to grow\r\n\r\nhere, so that they can feel invested in this country and have\r\n\r\na stake here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time that we are making room for top\r\n\r\ntalents,  we must also make room for those who are  going  to\r\n\r\nhave  a harder time in this high-speed world.  While we  must\r\n\r\nemphasize  training  and  skills  upgrading  to  prepare  our\r\n\r\npopulation for the new economy, and there are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlaudable  success  stories of those  who  have  made  it,  in\r\n\r\nreality,  not everyone can be retrained for the  new  digital\r\n\r\nage.   Some may just have to be helped along until their next\r\n\r\ngeneration  takes  over and brings the  entire  family  to  a\r\n\r\nhigher plane.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the media reported that the income gap was\r\n\r\nwidening.   Those  from  low-income  families  running  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses face a particularly daunting uphill struggle.  The\r\n\r\nsmall  business  owner is becoming a dying breed.   There  is\r\n\r\nalso a change in business operations and the big boys have an\r\n\r\nadvantage.  Take, for example, newspaper kiosks along Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad   and  at  bus  stops  are  tendered  and  won  by   big\r\n\r\ncorporations  like Singapore Press Holdings.  The  individual\r\n\r\nproprietors do not stand a chance in the tender exercise.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand that some schools are considering tendering  their\r\n\r\ncanteens  to  main contractors, who then find individuals  to\r\n\r\nrun the stalls for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this makes commercial sense in terms of\r\n\r\ncontrol, coordination and efficiency.  It is easier  to  deal\r\n\r\nonly with one \"big boss\" rather than many small ones.  It  is\r\n\r\neasier to sub-contract to a main contractor and let him  deal\r\n\r\nwith the small individual problems.  However, what this means\r\n\r\nis  that  the  small guys no longer have an avenue  to  start\r\n\r\nsmall, and will always be an employee and taken advantage  of\r\n\r\nby bosses who act as middlemen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many famous entrepreneurs have started small. One\r\n\r\nexample  is Li Ka-shing, who started the Cheung Kong  factory\r\n\r\nmaking plastic flowers.  Today, he is a major player in  real\r\n\r\nestate, retail, telecommunications, power generation and port\r\n\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we, in modern Singapore, have room for someone to\r\n\r\nstart  small and grow like this?  I would say it  is  a  room\r\n\r\nthat  is  getting smaller every day.  But I do think that  we\r\n\r\nneed  to  give  some due consideration to the small  business\r\n\r\nowner in Singapore, to give him a fair and fighting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchance to carve out some niche here.  I am happy that in this\r\n\r\nbudget, we have embarked on this process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the financial policy of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, in his Budget Statement, Finance  Minister  Dr\r\n\r\nRichard   Hu   described  this  as  the  most  generous   and\r\n\r\nunprecedented Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget is not only generous, but is thought of by\r\n\r\nmany  as being more generous than expected.  My personal view\r\n\r\nis  that  the  generosity  of  the  Finance  Minister  is   a\r\n\r\nprincipled  and creative one.  It is intended to relieve  the\r\n\r\npeople  from   hardship, reassuring the people,  pro-business\r\n\r\nand maintaining competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Potong Pasir said that this was\r\n\r\nan  \"election year\" Budget.  I think we can only say it is  a\r\n\r\nbudget  which  is  presented  close  to  an  election   year.\r\n\r\nUtilities, service and conservancy charges rebates will serve\r\n\r\nto  relieve the hardship of the lower-income group.  Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning Endowment Fund, Eldercare Fund and Medical Endowment\r\n\r\nFund  serve to reassure the people.  The various tax  rebates\r\n\r\nand  reductions will not only benefit the business  community\r\n\r\nbut also reaffirm  their competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the most touching part of his Budget Statement,\r\n\r\nparticularly to the lower and middle income workers  who  are\r\n\r\napprehensive  under  the impact of the new  economy,  is  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  statement, \"This year's Budget emphasises  how  to\r\n\r\nhelp  every  worker  to  pull  through  this  difficult   but\r\n\r\nnecessary  economic transformation.\"  The Minister also  said\r\n\r\nthat  in  the next 10 to 15 years we need to have a workforce\r\n\r\ncomprising  at least 65% workers who have received  secondary\r\n\r\neducation  and above.  Yet, in 1999, we had only 35%  of  our\r\n\r\nworkforce with secondary education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has allocated another $500 million to the\r\n\r\nLifelong Learning\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nEndowment  Fund.  The Fund has now $2 billion.  As this  Fund\r\n\r\nwill eventually be topped up to $5 billion, our challenge now\r\n\r\nis  how  to  mobilise every Singaporean  to   participate  in\r\n\r\nlifelong learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should let everyone know that the objective of\r\n\r\nlifelong  learning  is to enable our workers  to  tackle  the\r\n\r\nchallenges of the new economy, that is,  to have a job in the\r\n\r\nnew economy and to lead a good life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many workers have this worry: they thought that \"new\r\n\r\neconomy\"  means  computer technology,  companies  reform  and\r\n\r\nrestructure,  and hence more retrenchments.  Then,  they  may\r\n\r\nlose their jobs. To undergo retraining, they fear it may be a\r\n\r\ncase of \"The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, during the transitional period of migrating\r\n\r\nto  a  new economy, the Government should give them not  only\r\n\r\nthe  Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund but also the  lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning confidence.  Tell them, \"The new economy is actually\r\n\r\nbuilt  upon  the  foundation of the  old  economy.   The  new\r\n\r\neconomy  is not just computer technology, life sciences.   It\r\n\r\nalso  includes the essentials of our daily lives.\"   The  new\r\n\r\neconomy  is to solve the problems of our daily lives in  more\r\n\r\ninnovative ways, to improve our quality of life, and  to  let\r\n\r\nus lead better lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. I believe everyone of us\r\n\r\nmust have taken instant noodles.  I believe every family must\r\n\r\nhave  stored  some instant noodles at home.   In  fact,  many\r\n\r\npeople  are storing some packets of instant noodles in  their\r\n\r\noffice  to tackle the challenges brought about by working  in\r\n\r\nthe new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instant noodle was invented in the 1950s by Ando\r\n\r\nMomofuku  of Japan.  He is already 94 years old today.   This\r\n\r\nwas  the first chicken ramen invented by him in the 50s.  The\r\n\r\ninstant  noodle is a product of the old economy.  It  enables\r\n\r\nus  to  eat a bowl of steaming hot and stomach-filling noodle\r\n\r\nvery quickly, and it is cheap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, instant noodle is also a product of the new economy\r\n\r\nbecause it is continuously innovating, and new types of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproducts,  new flavours and new packaging are emerging  every\r\n\r\nday.   We  have now the cup noodle and the bowl  noodle.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, we do not need to have a cup or a bowl to enjoy\r\n\r\na meal of delicious instant noodle.  How creative!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant noodle is sold all over the world, even taking\r\n\r\nto  the  sky.   When we are hungry while taking a  long  haul\r\n\r\naircraft,  we  can simply ask the air hostess for  a  cup  of\r\n\r\ninstant  noodles.  Instant noodle can take to the sky because\r\n\r\nit is convenient and innovative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant noodle is part of the new economy. Our\r\n\r\nSingaporean popiah, kuehs, satay and roti prata can also  fit\r\n\r\ninto the new economy.  If we can be more creative to make the\r\n\r\nproduction of these delicacies more economical, tastier, more\r\n\r\n\"instant-cooking\", they can become a part of the new economy.\r\n\r\nIf  they  can be like the instant noodle selling to all  over\r\n\r\nthe  world, then they are part of the new economy!  I am glad\r\n\r\nto  see  that  our  \"Ti Yi Jia\" popiah  has  stepped  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Our Bengawan Solo has set up retail  outlets  at\r\n\r\nChangi Airport so that tourists can bring our Singapore brand\r\n\r\nhome.  These are products of the new economy!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hope that when the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment and the HDB upgrade their hawker centres, markets\r\n\r\nand  neighbourhood shops, they would create opportunities for\r\n\r\ncreative  Singaporeans  to start up not  only  in  their  HDB\r\n\r\nflats,  but  also in our markets and shops,  and  extend  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of the \"Creativity Fund\" to them.  Let the ordinary\r\n\r\nfolks see that when computer technology which is essential to\r\n\r\nthe new economy is creatively applied to our daily lives,  it\r\n\r\ncan make life better for everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only an example. I can give you hundreds of\r\n\r\nother   examples   to  illustrate  how  we  could   encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, especially the older Singaporeans, to take part\r\n\r\nin lifelong learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that in the new Budget, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\ncould consider\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nallocating  some  funds  to  encourage  employers  to  employ\r\n\r\nworkers who have undergone retraining, that is, those workers\r\n\r\nwho have migrated from the old economy to the new economy.  I\r\n\r\nalso  wish  that  while  emphasising  the  new  economy,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should also simultaneously tell all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat any service or product which brings about better results\r\n\r\nthrough creative measures will be needed by the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another illustration. Our public bus\r\n\r\nservice  conveys  some 2 million passenger-trips  every  day,\r\n\r\nabout half of our population.  Buses spur on our economy, our\r\n\r\nnew  economy.  If the buses do not move, our economy will  be\r\n\r\naffected.  As such, the bus service industry is also part  of\r\n\r\nthe new economy.  Can we not conduct various training schemes\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Government  to attract  more  workers  who  are\r\n\r\naffected  by the economic transformation to turn to  the  bus\r\n\r\nservice  industry?   I understand that many  years  ago,  SBS\r\n\r\nattempted  to promote a bus driver training scheme,  but  the\r\n\r\nresponse  was  not  encouraging.  If we  can  repackage  this\r\n\r\nscheme,  it should be able to help some Singaporeans who  are\r\n\r\naffected  by the economic transformation.  Let them obtain  a\r\n\r\nClass 4 licence which costs some $1,000.  This will also help\r\n\r\nto alleviate the problem of shortage in bus drivers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am citing all these examples to\r\n\r\nillustrate the fact that apart from computer technology,  our\r\n\r\nessentials in life, such as clothing, food, accommodation and\r\n\r\ntransportation, can also be part of the new economy.  As  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister said, \"Every Singaporean  can  continue  to\r\n\r\nplay a role in our new economy.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget Statement by the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nBudget  2001  is a generous one.  As this is my  last  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech  in  this House, I would like to express a few  wishes\r\n\r\nfor this House to consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by adopting as a starting principle in S21 that\r\n\r\n\"everyone   matters\",  we  have,  as  a  society,  explicitly\r\n\r\nrecognised  that,  while we should continue  to  nurture  the\r\n\r\nelites,  the  very  smart children and  big  or  leading-edge\r\n\r\nbusinesses, we must now equally focus our attention  on  ways\r\n\r\nto  enhance  the quality of life for many other  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  so  smart, not so capable and also  the  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses like what Mr Seng Han Thong had argued for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for us, there is no abject, absolute poverty\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  However, poverty, as any sociologist or social\r\n\r\npsychologist will attest to, is a relative measure  of  well-being.   And even in the richest societies, so long as  there\r\n\r\nis  competition and a free market place where some are better\r\n\r\noff  than  others, there will be pockets of  underclass,  the\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged and the marginalised.  That is not something to\r\n\r\nbe ashamed of or to hide, but instead, to try to reduce it by\r\n\r\nfirst  understanding what is happening, and then how to  deal\r\n\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need better and more sophisticated measures of\r\n\r\nrelative  poverty, such as the impact of the length  of  time\r\n\r\nfamilies  spend  in so-called \"poor\" status,  on  the  mental\r\n\r\nhealth  of various family members and suicide rates;  or  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  low  income  on educational  opportunities,  even\r\n\r\nwithin  a  meritocratic  society.  We  need  to  explore  the\r\n\r\ncomplex  dynamics between drop-out rates from  school,  crime\r\n\r\nrate,  family break-ups, poorer housing conditions and income\r\n\r\nlevels.  The recent release in the Straits Times on the  rise\r\n\r\nof  children  as  young  as pre-primary  and  primary  levels\r\n\r\nseeking psychiatric help is a disturbing trend.  Is this, for\r\n\r\nexample,  related  to  income at all?   Or  is  it  a  stress\r\n\r\ncondition caused by school pressures which affects all social\r\n\r\nclasses?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the \"untidy\", no-simple-answer social\r\n\r\ncomplexities  which  are masked by macro-economic  statistics\r\n\r\nsuch as per capita GDP.  Now that we have arrived as a nation\r\n\r\nand achieved the highest per capita GDP in the region, we can\r\n\r\ndo more than meeting the basic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneeds  of  Singaporeans by addressing the numerous challenges\r\n\r\ndue to globalisation.  It is not just the low-income families\r\n\r\nwhich  are  struggling,  the impact of  modern  day  stresses\r\n\r\nclaims  its  casualties in all social  classes  in  different\r\n\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the low-income or socially disadvantaged\r\n\r\nfamilies  need  integrated solutions  to  their  inter-linked\r\n\r\nproblems.  As Dr Hu himself had said in a World Bank  meeting\r\n\r\nlast   year  that  a  \"new  social  contract  is  needed   as\r\n\r\ndistribution of wealth and opportunities cannot depend solely\r\n\r\non  free  market\"  (June  7,  2000,  Business  Times).   This\r\n\r\ninitiative  requires a belief in the worth of the  individual\r\n\r\nby  offering  to  those who fall behind a second  chance  and\r\n\r\nadditional  support to move on. The Government had identified\r\n\r\ntraining  as  an important support but we also need  to  know\r\n\r\nwhat  are  the  socio-psychological barriers to learning  and\r\n\r\nretraining and why are the older workers not stepping forward\r\n\r\nto  retrain.   Education is provided for  even for  the  poor\r\n\r\nwith  the  Education Fund proposed in the  Budget,  but  what\r\n\r\nabout those in the 60s and older who are beyond training  and\r\n\r\nexpect to live for 15 to 20 years more?  How are we going  to\r\n\r\nshare our prosperity with them?  Will they get farther behind\r\n\r\nus as our nation is hurtling into the new era?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need now to give substance to PM's call for a caring\r\n\r\nsociety  by  starting  to construct  a  new  social  contract\r\n\r\nthrough   specific  measures.  We  can  begin  by  committing\r\n\r\nresources  to tracking a range of social exclusion indicators\r\n\r\nwith  the  objective of monitoring whether we see a permanent\r\n\r\nunderclass emerging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to propose four measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, after a decade of dialogues and workshops on the\r\n\r\nfamily,  we  need some closure by enunciating a clear  family\r\n\r\npolicy  that  addresses  the needs of  families.   This  will\r\n\r\ngenerate an ethical movement to help Singaporeans re-focus on\r\n\r\nfamily  values  and  encourage the start-up  of  a  range  of\r\n\r\nservices and industries to cater to the needs of working\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncouples.  Like the $500 million Lifelong Learning Fund  which\r\n\r\nwas  set  up  to develop a slew of programmes to upgrade  our\r\n\r\nworkers, we should set up a similar $500 million Family  Fund\r\n\r\nto  implement the numerous recommendations on family-friendly\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, set up an Inter-Ministry Fund to sponsor joint\r\n\r\nprojects which need to be addressed in a concerted effort  by\r\n\r\nall  Ministries  and  civil servants.  For  example,  in  our\r\n\r\neffort to implement an effective care plan and rehabilitation\r\n\r\nprogrammes for domestic violence victims and perpetrators, we\r\n\r\nneed  to  draw the IT resources of the various Ministries  to\r\n\r\nproduce  a  central database on domestic violence  cases  and\r\n\r\ntheir  profile.  We have talked about this project  for  four\r\n\r\nyears  and the progress has been slow, because there  was  no\r\n\r\nownership  by  any  one Ministry due to a  lack  in  funding.\r\n\r\nOther  projects  include the collaboration among  MCDS,  MOM,\r\n\r\nNTUC  and  SNEF  to set up formal structures,  processes  and\r\n\r\nactivities   to   facilitate  implementation  of   pro-family\r\n\r\npractices  at workplaces.  Another urgent need is to  enhance\r\n\r\nthe  channels  of  information sharing  and  coordination  of\r\n\r\nservices  between  prisons and the community-based  voluntary\r\n\r\nagencies in dealing with special needs of children and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies made vulnerable by both their parents' incarceration\r\n\r\ndue to drug offences.  These children, about 850 of them, are\r\n\r\nleft unattended by their own parents.  Sir, the fragmentation\r\n\r\nand  duplication  of efforts at all fronts  is  wasteful  and\r\n\r\nfrustrating for all the officers involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in view of continuing labour shortage in the\r\n\r\nservices sector and particularly higher attrition rates among\r\n\r\nsocial  work  graduates, we may need to develop  social  work\r\n\r\nskills  within our communities.  I propose that we set  up  a\r\n\r\nSocial  Service Training Scheme in each CDC to design adapted\r\n\r\nsocial  work  curriculum to be conducted  in  various  family\r\n\r\nservice centres and community centres, with the objective  of\r\n\r\nproducing a larger pool of social service personnel  to  meet\r\n\r\nspecific needs of that community.  Housewives, retirees, mid-life adults wishing to change\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncareers, retrenched mid-40s who have no paper qualifications,\r\n\r\nretired teachers, nurses and youths can be tapped and trained\r\n\r\nthrough  modular  programmes, to  deliver  paid  social  work\r\n\r\nduties.    By  introducing  social  service  skills  training\r\n\r\nprogrammes outside of tertiary institutions and locating them\r\n\r\nwithin   the   community,   with   proper   supervision   and\r\n\r\naccreditation  status,  we can effectively  match  the  right\r\n\r\npeople to appropriate skill modules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, set up a once-off Parliamentary Committee to\r\n\r\nreview and rationalise budgetary, regulatory and professional\r\n\r\nissues  related  to  the  social services  and  its  delivery\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.    Let me raise specific issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should Government adjust the current 50-50 co-sharing\r\n\r\nscheme for subsidising the operating expenses of a VWO  to  a\r\n\r\n60-40  funding formula considering that operating  costs  are\r\n\r\nrising  faster than Singaporeans' willingness  to  donate  to\r\n\r\ncharities?   At  the  level of service  providers,  will  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  allow a VWO to operate a school for drop-outs  to\r\n\r\npromote  second  chance  education?   Will  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation fund it partially?  If a VWO is willing to  deliver\r\n\r\noccupational  therapy services to homes and  charge  for  its\r\n\r\nservices,  can it do so without losing its funding  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?  There are many suggestions which can enliven the\r\n\r\nsocial  service sector and make it more dynamic  and  market-driven,  if  some  of  the  regulatory  restrictions  on  the\r\n\r\noperations  can be re-assessed.  Can we move  away  from  the\r\n\r\ncomfort  zone  of  making small step incremental  changes  to\r\n\r\npolicies  and instead map out new working models which  place\r\n\r\nVWOs at the core of the delivery infrastructure?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our effort to professionalise and upgrade social\r\n\r\nservices,  we  need to address the remuneration structure  of\r\n\r\nthe  sector  to incentivise more to join and remain  in  this\r\n\r\nsector.   In  similar arguments which we have  used  to  keep\r\n\r\ncivil servants or teachers in their jobs by paying them\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwell,  we need to consider paying social workers well  enough\r\n\r\nto ensure that they deliver quality service to those in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we also rationalise a policy on eldercare after\r\n\r\nso  many  dialogues and workshops were conducted  last  year?\r\n\r\nWho  is  designing a policy on disability and addressing  the\r\n\r\ncritical need for rehabilitative and residential needs of the\r\n\r\nseverely mentally handicapped in order to lighten the  burden\r\n\r\nof  parents  who  need to go out to work?  Indeed,  NCSS  and\r\n\r\nMCDS,  as well as MOE, are the institutions tasked to provide\r\n\r\nnew  guidelines and seek more funding for services on  behalf\r\n\r\nof these vulnerable communities.  I remember the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance told me last year that he never failed to give  money\r\n\r\naway  if there were good reasons, but only if they were being\r\n\r\nrequested  by the various Ministries in the first  place.   I\r\n\r\nurge  the officers to take this point seriously and  help  to\r\n\r\nchampion the needs of the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to thoroughly review outdated regulatory\r\n\r\nmechanisms  and  planning norms.   Let  me  illustrate.   The\r\n\r\nfinancial support of 90% capital funding for a special school\r\n\r\nand rehabilitation workshop for the disabled is based on what\r\n\r\nthe   MOE  and  MCDS  define  as  \"supported\"  areas.   These\r\n\r\nsupported  areas  are based on space norms which  were  fixed\r\n\r\nduring  the  seventies,  at  a time  when  physiotherapy  and\r\n\r\noccupational  therapy  were based on high  touch  and  simple\r\n\r\nequipment.   Today,  with  better  and  larger  physiotherapy\r\n\r\nequipment, more space is needed, but VWOs will not be  funded\r\n\r\nfor  this  increased space requirement, as  the  space  norms\r\n\r\nremain  unchanged.  Believe it or not, this rigidity  applies\r\n\r\nin  setting  space norms for details such  as  toilets.   And\r\n\r\ndifferent Ministries set different space norms.  For example,\r\n\r\nfor  occupational  therapy functions,  MOE  funds  42  square\r\n\r\nmetres for two persons, and MCDS funds 18 square metres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VWOs today find the norms too outdated, limited and\r\n\r\nrestrictive.   So,  in order to develop a building  with  the\r\n\r\ndesired features optimal for the comfort\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  their  clients  who are on wheelchairs,  for  example,  a\r\n\r\nsocial  agency  ends up paying close to 40%  of  the  capital\r\n\r\nfunding,  instead of just the 10%. On top of that, they  need\r\n\r\nto  find  more money for furniture installed outside  of  the\r\n\r\n\"supported areas\", including office installations.   What  is\r\n\r\npeculiar  to  me  is,  for  a  group  such  as  the  Spastics\r\n\r\nAssociation which is tasked to equip the disabled with  basic\r\n\r\nself-management  skills and cooking being one  such  critical\r\n\r\nskill, the space designated as domestic science classrooms is\r\n\r\nnot  funded  by  MOE.    Yet, the Ministry  funds  mainstream\r\n\r\nschools which conduct domestic science classes.  Sir, I think\r\n\r\nwe need to revamp, assess and fix new space norms for special\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given that a budget surplus of $4.4 billion has\r\n\r\nbeen  forecasted for the coming financial year, and if  there\r\n\r\nis another severe economic downturn, I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nfocus  on the lower 10% segment of the population and support\r\n\r\nthe social services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last wish, Sir, is that the representation of women\r\n\r\nparliamentarians and female community leaders  and  directors\r\n\r\nat  all  levels, will increase in order to provide  a  multi-layered  perspective to social and economic policies.   Their\r\n\r\nincreased  participation may help to highlight more questions\r\n\r\non the social sector which I hope will be given more priority\r\n\r\nto  be raised in this House.  If families are the pillars  of\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion, then women's role in forging this  cohesion\r\n\r\nis  critical, as they are the primary care-givers tending  to\r\n\r\nthe needs of the young and the old.  They know the challenges\r\n\r\nof keeping families intact.  They know the impact of economic\r\n\r\nupswings  and downturns on family cohesion.  If we listen  to\r\n\r\nwhat  women  have to say and want, gentlemen, we  would  have\r\n\r\nhelped to solve literally half of the country's problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in this debate.  I rise in support of\r\n\r\nBudget FY2001 and the financial policies that underpin it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by all accounts, this is a Budget that is generous\r\n\r\nand  many speakers have already alluded to that.  But, to me,\r\n\r\nI  think this Budget is significant for one particular reason\r\n\r\nand,  that is, it is introducing not just a series of one-off\r\n\r\ntransfers,  but also systemic and structural changes  to  our\r\n\r\nfiscal regime.  I think that is important because it has  the\r\n\r\neffect  of translating one-off gains in our surpluses into  a\r\n\r\r\nstream   of  incentives,  a  flow  of  benefits,   for   both\r\n\r\nindividuals and corporations.  And I welcome that  because  I\r\n\r\nthink it will serve our long-term goals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a case in point, I would like to focus on corporate\r\n\r\ntax.  I think lowering the corporate tax by 1%, to 24.5%,  is\r\n\r\na  good  gesture,  and it is certainly in  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\ntimes.    Avowedly   socialist  regimes  like   Sweden   have\r\n\r\naggressively reduced their corporate tax, and it is  good  to\r\n\r\nsee   that  Singapore  is  not  sitting  by  waiting  to   be\r\n\r\ncompetitively outflanked by these countries.  But having said\r\n\r\nthat, Sir, and I think the previous speaker Mrs Lim Hwee  Hua\r\n\r\nmentioned this and I would like to bring up this point again,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  has  previously mentioned that  the  long-term\r\n\r\ntarget was 25% for the corporate tax.  And one of the reasons\r\n\r\nhe  cited  was concern about Singapore becoming a tax  haven,\r\n\r\nand  I  believe this, in particular, was linked  to  concerns\r\n\r\nfrom certain countries which are big investors here.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to know how has this scenario changed and perhaps, more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  since this threshold has now been breached  and\r\n\r\nwe  have gone below 25%, the question is: what next?   And  I\r\n\r\nwould be grateful if the Minister could share with this House\r\n\r\nthe  Government's thinking on its longer-term target for  the\r\n\r\ncorporate tax, and what will be the parameters that  it  will\r\n\r\nuse in determining that policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also welcome the introduction of preferential tax\r\n\r\ntreatment for the first $100,000 of the chargeable income  of\r\n\r\ncorporations.  This has introduced, I think, as a  matter  of\r\n\r\nprinciple for the first time, an element of progressivity  in\r\n\r\nthe  corporate tax regime in Singapore.  I think  this  is  a\r\n\r\nvery   welcome  development  and  certainly  SMEs   who   are\r\n\r\nprofitable will be thankful for it.  And I do hope that  this\r\n\r\nis a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprinciple  that  the  Government  will  apply  with   greater\r\n\r\nflexibility in the years ahead in response to scenarios.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus on the company stock option plan\r\n\r\n(CSOP).   Sir,  the  move  to  extend  the  preferential  tax\r\n\r\ntreatment  to established companies is a welcome  one.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  when  it  was first introduced for the start-ups,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  was  when will it be extended to  other  companies,\r\n\r\nsince the principles underlying stock options are general  in\r\n\r\nnature.   Having introduced the scheme, I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister two specific questions.  The first, why is there\r\n\r\na  difference in the tax treatment between start-ups  on  the\r\n\r\none  hand  and  established  companies  on  the  other?   The\r\n\r\nmotivation  for  a  stock option scheme  is  the  same.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  has, in the past, argued that it is because  start-ups  have  greater difficulty in attracting  talent.   But  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask  the Minister to consider this.  In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nstart-ups,  those  who join the start-ups tend  to  get  much\r\n\r\nlarger   quantities  of  stock  options.   So  there   is   a\r\n\r\nquantitative  element in the attractiveness of start-ups  and\r\n\r\nthe option schemes therein.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, one could also argue quite persuasively that\r\n\r\nthe  scope for upside in a start-up is significantly  greater\r\n\r\nprovided it succeeds.  Given those scenarios, I would imagine\r\n\r\nthat even if the tax regime for stock options is the same for\r\n\r\nall companies, it should not adversely affect the ability  of\r\n\r\nstart-ups to attract talent.  So I would appreciate it if the\r\n\r\nMinister could explain why there is this differentiation  and\r\n\r\nwhether there is scope to harmonise this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of this CSOP scheme is the requirement\r\n\r\nthat  50%  of  employees must have stock options  before  the\r\n\r\ncompany  can  qualify.    Sir,  I understand  the  motivation\r\n\r\nbehind  it  and I fully appreciate the intent.  But  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to pose two questions:  one, which I think is a problem\r\n\r\nin  principle,  is stock options in general are  targeted  as\r\n\r\nincentive   devices   for  the  senior   management   of   an\r\n\r\norganisation.  It\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis debatable how valuable it is as a device to motivate lower\r\n\r\ndown  the  ranks, because the quantum given to them would  be\r\n\r\nrelatively  small.   And, secondly, there are  other  devices\r\n\r\nsuch   as   variable  bonuses  and  other  performance-linked\r\n\r\nincentives, which can take its place.  That being the case, I\r\n\r\nthink  it poses a problem in principle why we need to  insist\r\n\r\non this 50% minimum allocation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is the problem in practice. Sir, today, in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there  are  many  corporations  which  will   use\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a  HQ  for  R&D  and  certain  core  types  of\r\n\r\nactivities, but it is not uncommon to find that the  bulk  of\r\n\r\ntheir manufacturing operations and other activities may  well\r\n\r\nbe conducted outside the country.  It is not uncommon to find\r\n\r\ncompanies  which  have got the bulk of their manpower  living\r\n\r\nand  working in countries outside Singapore, in ASEAN, China,\r\n\r\netc.   These  are  subsidiaries or  wholly-owned.   In  these\r\n\r\ninstances,  the 50% requirement, it seems to  me,  will  pose\r\n\r\nquite  a  problem for the company to structure  a  meaningful\r\n\r\nstock  option scheme for those working in China, in order  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the 50% threshold.  So without knowing the full details\r\n\r\nof  the scheme, I would urge the Minister to consider a  more\r\n\r\nflexible  application of this requirement.  In the limit,  it\r\n\r\nwould   be  best  if  the  requirement  could  be  eliminated\r\n\r\naltogether.   But  if  that is not the case,  then  certainly\r\n\r\nlowering  the threshold, I think, would be very  helpful  for\r\n\r\nsuch companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the matter of systems and structures, may I just\r\n\r\nturn  my  focus  now to transfers and income  redistribution.\r\n\r\nFirst,  I  would like to add my voice to the chorus of  those\r\n\r\nwho have asked for a more generous  -  if I may use that term\r\n\r\n-   treatment  of  pensioners.  I heard  feedback  from  many\r\n\r\npensioners that a $10 increment in the Singapore Allowance is\r\n\r\nby  all  means not the best that the Government can  do,  and\r\n\r\nthey ask that they be treated with greater consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Sir, in more general terms, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has used three main devices to effect some form of\r\n\r\nwealth sharing or income redistribution\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  transfers.   The first device has been tax  rebates  and\r\n\r\nreductions in tax for individual income.  The fact that  more\r\n\r\nthan two-thirds of Singaporeans, and I believe the proportion\r\n\r\nwill  rise with recent measures, I think the first $7,500  of\r\n\r\nchargeable  income will now be tax exempt  as  well,  so  the\r\n\r\nproportion  of  Singaporeans who do not pay income  tax  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  be above 70%.   The effectiveness of  tax  rebates\r\n\r\nand  tax rates reduction as a means of redistributing  wealth\r\n\r\nor sharing wealth is limited.  It is more, I think, correctly\r\n\r\nregarded   as   a  device  to  incentivise  those   who   are\r\n\r\nproductively contributing to the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second device the Government has used is direct\r\n\r\ntransfers.   The  examples are the CPF top-up  or  the  SC/CC\r\n\r\nrebates  and the like.  And in these instances, there  is  an\r\n\r\nelement  of progressivity, because the quantum is  pegged  to\r\n\r\nthe  housing type and the number of rooms in an HDB  flat  is\r\n\r\nused as an indicator of the level of wealth or socio-economic\r\n\r\nstanding  of the family or an income earner.  While this  has\r\n\r\nits  limitations,  I understand that it is  not  perfect  but\r\n\r\nprobably  one  of the most practical proxies,  and  I  accept\r\n\r\nthat.   But we have to bear in mind therefore that  this  too\r\n\r\nhas  its limitations, as a device to redistribute income  and\r\n\r\nwealth within Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third device has been endowments. We have set up\r\n\r\nnumerous  endowment funds, as and when our  budget  surpluses\r\n\r\nallow  for  it.   These have been the Edusave Endowment,  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Endowment  Fund, the ElderCare  Fund,  the  Lifelong\r\n\r\nLearning Fund and so on and so forth.  There is a whole range\r\n\r\nof  these endowments.  They each serve specific purposes, but\r\n\r\nthe  general principle in setting aside an endowment is  that\r\n\r\nthe income will be used to meet particular policy objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these measures have advantages and\r\n\r\ndisadvantages and, collectively, they do serve a  purpose  in\r\n\r\nredistributing and sharing wealth in Singapore.   But  having\r\n\r\nsaid  that,  I would like to ask the Minister whether,  given\r\n\r\nthat  fewer  Singaporeans will be paying income  tax  in  the\r\n\r\nyears\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nahead,  there  is,  as  part  of the  Government's  financial\r\n\r\npolicy,  an  effort to perhaps transfer more  of  the  income\r\n\r\nredistribution  through direct transfers as  opposed  to  tax\r\n\r\nrebates  and  the  endowments.  I  would  like  to  get  some\r\n\r\nclarification on that from the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, and this is a point that Mrs Lim Hwee\r\n\r\nHua  alluded  to, I would like to reinforce  this  with  some\r\n\r\nspecific  proposals.  I think the Budget is a  very  imposing\r\n\r\ndocument  and  it is a budget certainly at the  macro  level.\r\n\r\nBut  it  is micro in its impact on individuals and companies.\r\n\r\nThere  is a need to be able to communicate the effect of  the\r\n\r\nBudget and the slew of Government measures that have been set\r\n\r\nup   time   and  again  to  help  individuals  and  companies\r\n\r\neffectively to the target audience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two specific requests which the Minister if he\r\n\r\ncould  consider  them,  I would be grateful.   The  first  is\r\n\r\nwhether, either as part of any Budget presentation or perhaps\r\n\r\nas  a  separate  exercise, together with the media  or  other\r\n\r\ncommunication  channels, the Government can  demonstrate  the\r\n\r\nnet   effect  of  various  transfers,  etc,  on  the  average\r\n\r\nSingaporean earner.  For example, we could define that as a 4-room  flat  resident with a median income of about  $1,500  a\r\n\r\nmonth.   But the key point here really is bringing the Budget\r\n\r\ndown  to  the  average man's level.  Many fail to  grasp  the\r\n\r\nsignificance of various measures.  And I feel that this would\r\n\r\nbe one way of getting the message across, that indeed if they\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  totality of what is being  offered,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  being fair and channelling the incentives  to\r\n\r\ntargeted areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect is in terms of communication on this\r\n\r\nwhole  range  of  endowments that have  been  created.   Each\r\n\r\nMinistry   or   statutory   board   is   charged   with   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for a particular endowment under its care  and\r\n\r\nmanages its own communication.  But I think it would be  fair\r\n\r\nto  say that on the ground, the information is certainly  not\r\n\r\nperfect  and many would still be quite confused or  at  least\r\n\r\nunaware of the various schemes and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhat  is  required.   Sir, the Ministry  of  Finance  has  an\r\n\r\noverview of the entire range of endowments we have set up  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I think it would be very helpful if the  Ministry\r\n\r\ncould,  in fact, come out with a communication plan.   It  is\r\n\r\nnot  just about printing brochures but a systematic means  of\r\n\r\ngetting  the  message across to agencies that are interacting\r\n\r\non  the ground with the average Singaporeans and companies on\r\n\r\nthe  whole  range of measures in place.  And I do  not  think\r\n\r\nthis  is a one-off exercise either because every year we have\r\n\r\nnew  developments, and in fact even between budgets  we  have\r\n\r\nchanges.   There is a need to communicate this in a  holistic\r\n\r\nway  so  that agencies on the ground - for individuals,  this\r\n\r\ncould  be  the  CDCs  or CCCs even; on the  other  hand,  for\r\n\r\ncorporations, it could be various business groups and so on - understand the total picture and are ready to dispense advice\r\n\r\nappropriately.  I know some of these have already been  done,\r\n\r\nSir.   But  I  wonder whether the Ministry of Finance  could,\r\n\r\nthrough  its leadership, bring all this together as  one  key\r\n\r\ncommunication  device  which  is managed  systematically  and\r\n\r\nregularly,  so  that all Singaporeans can  benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we truly cross into the new millennium. If\r\n\r\nthis  marks  our  journey  into a  new  future,  then  surely\r\n\r\nMinister  Richard Hu has ensured that Budget 2001 befits  the\r\n\r\noccasion.   This  is indeed a commendable Budget.   There  is\r\n\r\nsomething for everyone.  It caters to both the future and the\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has prepared this Budget with an eye\r\n\r\ntowards  the future.  He has reduced the corporate,  property\r\n\r\nand  individual tax rates.  Unlike rebates, these  alter  the\r\n\r\ntax  structure for the long term.  He has made available more\r\n\r\nmoney for education to ensure that our young are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwell  prepared for the future.  In an increasingly  uncertain\r\n\r\nworld, he has provided for national security.  He has ensured\r\n\r\nthat  research efforts will not be hampered for the  lack  of\r\n\r\nfunds.  This reflects the Government's thinking and vision of\r\n\r\na  competitive  globalised  future.   The  Minister  has  not\r\n\r\nforgotten  the sacrifices of the people.  He remembers  their\r\n\r\ncontributions to the sterling recovery and performance of the\r\n\r\neconomy  last  year.  He has generously shared  the  economic\r\n\r\nsurplus with the people with, for example, increases in  tax,\r\n\r\nrental  and  service and conservancy rebates.   Some  people,\r\n\r\nlike  Mr  Chiam See Tong, have described this as an \"Election\r\n\r\nBudget\".   But  surely at all times, it  is  the  hope  of  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  to be able to announce a generous budget  that  a\r\n\r\ncountry can afford.  I congratulate Minister Dr Richard Hu on\r\n\r\nBudget 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore will encounter many challenges as we\r\n\r\ntransit into the new economy which is dictated by information\r\n\r\nand  information technology.  Among these, let  me  highlight\r\n\r\nthe  issues  of  the digital and social divides.   These  are\r\n\r\ndivisive  issues for a society.  These issues are not  unique\r\n\r\nto Singapore.  All societies moving into the new economy will\r\n\r\nface  them.  Several of my fellow Members of Parliament  have\r\n\r\nspoken on these issues.  Let me add my views to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new economy needs people who are information\r\n\r\ntechnology  literate.   People  who  cannot  use  information\r\n\r\ntechnology  will  be cut off from the many new  opportunities\r\n\r\nthat  will  become available.  They will be confined  to  the\r\n\r\nless  meaningful and low-paying jobs which at the  same  time\r\n\r\nwill  also decrease.  People who are tuned to the new economy\r\n\r\nwill thus earn more.  The divide between the well-off and the\r\n\r\nless well-off will widen and become more entrenched with  the\r\n\r\nIT factor.  Who are those affected?  They are not only people\r\n\r\nwithout  or with low education but also the older people  who\r\n\r\ngrew  up  in  a  world without computers  and  have  problems\r\n\r\nlearning to use it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The digital divide will widen the income gap. This is\r\n\r\nthe reality of the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBut what is important is to make sure that everyone shares in\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  of  the  new economy.   I  am  glad  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  allocating more money for education  and  has\r\n\r\nspared  no effort to introduce IT into our classrooms at  all\r\n\r\nlevels,   schools,   junior   colleges,   polytechnics    and\r\n\r\nuniversities.   The positive outcome of this effort  will  be\r\n\r\nseen in the years ahead.  But I would like the Government  to\r\n\r\ndo more for the rest of the population - the old, the working\r\n\r\npeople  and all the others who are not IT-literate - to  help\r\n\r\nthem  learn to use the computer.  This will open the new  and\r\n\r\nincreasing well-paying jobs and opportunities to  them.   Let\r\n\r\nus   also  retain  jobs  that  do  not  really  need  to   be\r\n\r\ncomputerised  for the others who cannot adapt to  information\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what we do, there will always be some who will\r\n\r\nfall through the net.  These are the people who are unable to\r\n\r\ncope  in  an  increasingly competitive new economy.   In  the\r\n\r\nUnited States where the upper end earns over 400 times  those\r\n\r\nat the lower end it is an indication we are living in a world\r\n\r\nwhere the income gap will continue to widen.  The feeling  of\r\n\r\nhaving  lost  out  will increase among  those  who  are  less\r\n\r\nsuccessful.  The sharing of the success of the nation will be\r\n\r\nimportant  for  the  unity of the  country.   The  system  to\r\n\r\nsupport those in need needs to be strengthened.  This  became\r\n\r\nevident  during the recent economic crisis.  The solution  is\r\n\r\nnot  merely financial.  The issue is how to help them to  get\r\n\r\nout  of  the  rut and on their feet again.  How can  we  help\r\n\r\nthose  who are unemployed to get a job?   What can we  do  to\r\n\r\nhelp  those  who  have become structurally irrelevant  become\r\n\r\nemployable  once  again  in the new economy?   In  a  rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging  world  where  a person is  expected  to  have  many\r\n\r\ncareers  in  a lifetime, such help will become  routine.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to  devise  a more robust support system  to  help  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, social cohesion is crucial for a nation. In a new\r\n\r\neconomy,   social  pressures  arising  from  the  impact   of\r\n\r\ninformation technology will stress social cohesion.  We  must\r\n\r\nconsciously  and  proactively tackle  these  pressures.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment understands the urgency of the task and has  taken\r\n\r\nsteps\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin this direction.  More, however, can and needs to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin  support of the motion standing in the name of the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all Singaporeans, I must compliment the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance for delivering a sterling Budget.  It is hard  to\r\n\r\nfind fault with such a Budget, except asking the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance to do more of everything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps with such a large surplus to give away, I can\r\n\r\nonly  suggest  that the Government should put some  money  to\r\n\r\ntrain Singaporeans from all walks of life to be IT-savvy.  If\r\n\r\nwe wish to transform the way we do things, the way we conduct\r\n\r\nGovernment  business, especially making use of computers  and\r\n\r\nthe  Internet,  then we must train everyone  who  is  not  in\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister spoke of a major transformation in\r\n\r\nthe  delivery  of  Government  services  by  providing  these\r\n\r\nservices  online.  He said that, \"By the end  of  this  year,\r\n\r\nnearly   two-thirds  of  all  Government  services  will   be\r\n\r\navailable online in some way or other, making them accessible\r\n\r\n24 hours a day\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I applaud the Government's long-term plan to move\r\n\r\nwith  the  inevitable  way business is  being  conducted  and\r\n\r\ntargeting its services to be accessible 24 hours a day, there\r\n\r\nare  a number of other issues.  Chief amongst this is how  to\r\n\r\nmake sure that the users of today, and the users of today are\r\n\r\nnot   the  school  children, they  are  the  housewives,  the\r\n\r\nretirees  and the not-so-well-educated, can avail  themselves\r\n\r\nof  such  services and use these online services effectively.\r\n\r\nThe  Government must embark on programmes to make \"IT for the\r\n\r\nMasses\"  or  \"IT  for Everyone\" a competitive  advantage  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides bringing all Singaporeans into the online\r\n\r\nmainstream, we must make\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsure  online  transactions  are secure  and  effective.   Are\r\n\r\nonline services user-friendly and easy to locate?  Since  all\r\n\r\nGovernment  Ministries  attempt  to  provide  their  services\r\n\r\nonline,  how  does the Government ensure that there  is  some\r\n\r\nuniformity in the design?  The Government must set up a  body\r\n\r\nto   ensure  security  and  measure  the  effectiveness   and\r\n\r\nefficiency of the online services.\r\n\r\nIT for Everyone\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now no funds set aside to make IT education\r\n\r\navailable  to  the whole population.  Funds and  effort  have\r\n\r\nbeen  concentrated on our students and rightly so.   But  the\r\n\r\npopulation at large who are users of Government services must\r\n\r\nalso  not  be ignored.  The Government must not restrict  its\r\n\r\nresources  to  just students alone if we are  to  make  IT  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  advantage  for  Singapore.   We  must  also  pay\r\n\r\nspecial  attention  to  the  housewives,  the  retirees,  the\r\n\r\nretrenched  workers and those who are not so  well  educated.\r\n\r\nIn   other  words,  we  must  bring  IT  education   to   the\r\n\r\nheartlanders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this to happen, the Government must intensify its\r\n\r\nefforts  by  funding the CDCs, the CCCs and the RCs  to  help\r\n\r\nthem set up computer centres.  These centres will be able  to\r\n\r\noffer  IT  literacy courses and bring IT to the doorsteps  of\r\n\r\nour  residents.   This  doorstep approach  will  garner  more\r\n\r\nsupport  from the housewives, the retirees, the  elderly  and\r\n\r\nanyone  who is interested because it is in their own locality\r\n\r\nand  within familiar settings, on home ground, so  to  speak.\r\n\r\nSuch  an approach will lower the barrier to learning and make\r\n\r\nIT   education  easily  available  and  affordable.   To  the\r\n\r\nsceptics, I can quote an example to illustrate that  such  an\r\n\r\napproach can work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take the example of the close collaboration between\r\n\r\nthe  Fengshan CC and the Marine Parade CDC in setting up  two\r\n\r\nStudent  Care Centres fully equipped with computers and  four\r\n\r\ncomputer centres attached to our preschool education centres.\r\n\r\nThese centres are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nequipped with broadband systems so as to allow for very quick\r\n\r\nInternet  access.  Fengshan PCF kindergarten is  one  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst to provide computer-aided education to all children and\r\n\r\nnot  only those whose parents can afford to pay.  Today,  all\r\n\r\nFengshan  pre-schoolers are taught to surf the  Internet  and\r\n\r\nthey know how to use e-mail.  The younger they are, the lower\r\n\r\nthe barrier to learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the real success story is the use of the\r\n\r\ncentres  to  train adults in the evenings and  the  weekends.\r\n\r\nThere  are  ongoing  computer  courses  for  the  masses   at\r\n\r\naffordable  and  competitive  rates  for  people  within  the\r\n\r\nconstituency and of course outside.  It is available to self-help groups, such as MENDAKI, private companies sending their\r\n\r\nstaff  for  upgrading courses, and many other  organisations.\r\n\r\nIn  the  last three years alone, some 25,000 persons, and  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  two  years  more than 9,000 a year  have  attended\r\n\r\ncourses  at the IT centres in Fengshan, and these numbers  do\r\n\r\nnot  include the kindergarten children.  Also, we have opened\r\n\r\nthe  centres in the evenings in the last two years  and  some\r\n\r\n3,000 residents actually dropped by to use the computers at a\r\n\r\nnominal  charge.   I  can shamelessly boast  of  the  success\r\n\r\nstories  that we hear so very often of how computer  literacy\r\n\r\nhas  helped  to improve the lives and livelihood of  so  many\r\n\r\ncomputer  illiterate persons in many different and unexpected\r\n\r\nways.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what do Mdm Lee Ah Eng, who is in her mid-50s and\r\n\r\nliving  in Bedok North, Mdm Sahara binte Hassan, 38 years,  a\r\n\r\nhousewife  and Mr Chin Sin Chong, a retiree have  in  common?\r\n\r\nSir, all of them know nothing about computers, let alone  sit\r\n\r\nin  front  of  one.   Today,  after  attending  the  computer\r\n\r\nliteracy  courses at Fengshan IT hub, they can  now  work  on\r\n\r\ncomputers  with  ease that belied their  true  profession  or\r\n\r\ntraining.   Mdm  Lee, the Treasurer of Fengshan  WEC,  was  a\r\n\r\nbutcher's assistant before the epidemic in pigs caused her to\r\n\r\nlose  her  job when the Government banned the sale  of  pork.\r\n\r\nHowever,  unlike her other colleagues in the same trade,  she\r\n\r\nquickly found another job not so long\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthereafter  as  a clerical officer of a pawnshop.   Sir,  the\r\n\r\npawnshop owner needed someone who knows how to use a computer\r\n\r\nto type out pawn tickets in English and Chinese.  Mdm Lee had\r\n\r\njust  completed  the Microsoft Word and Rich Win  97  courses\r\n\r\noffered at Fengshan IT Centre to grassroots leaders.  She  of\r\n\r\ncourse clinched the job right away during the interview after\r\n\r\nshe  proved  her  proficiency on the computer,  and  this  is\r\n\r\ndespite her age and lack of experience as a clerk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Sahara is a housewife who has never touched a\r\n\r\ntypewriter,  let  alone a computer all her  life,  until  she\r\n\r\njoined a computer course, especially designed for housewives,\r\n\r\nand she joined the course out of curiosity.  She can now surf\r\n\r\nthe  Internet  for  new  recipes  (cooking  recipes  are  her\r\n\r\ninterest) and exchange cooking tips and culinary skills  with\r\n\r\nfriends she has met online.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is a Mr Chin who is a retiree in his 60s.\r\n\r\nHe too has no computer knowledge but after attending a course\r\n\r\nat  Fengshan  IT  Centre,  he now  volunteers  himself  as  a\r\n\r\ncyberguide,  as we call it, so that he can teach the  elderly\r\n\r\nand other senior citizens how to use computers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we have proven the sceptics wrong that such an\r\n\r\napproach cannot work and that we may be putting money in  the\r\n\r\nwrong place.  But these are real life examples of why the use\r\n\r\nof  IT  has  to  be  widespread and made accessible  for  the\r\n\r\nmasses,  if  we  are to see a successful use of  Government's\r\n\r\nonline services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User-friendly online services. Sir, having trained the\r\n\r\npeople,  we must make certain that online services are  truly\r\n\r\nuser-friendly  and  effective.  I  quote  a  recent  personal\r\n\r\nexperience of how difficult the Ministry of Manpower's online\r\n\r\nservices   were.    I   went  into  the  MOM's   website   at\r\n\r\nwww.mom.gov.sg  to check whether an intended  foreign  worker\r\n\r\npossesses a valid employment pass.  Sir, I could not  find  a\r\n\r\nlink  on this web page at all after going through several  of\r\n\r\nthe  menu items.  I finally called a toll free number  listed\r\n\r\non this page.  Unfortunately, the menu of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntelephone services was not listed on this website.  So I  had\r\n\r\nto  go to the menu, the sub-menus and several menu items.  At\r\n\r\nthe  end  of it all, out of frustration, I went back  to  the\r\n\r\nmain menu and got an officer on the line.  After five minutes\r\n\r\nof  good classical music, a nice charming officer came to the\r\n\r\nline  and  she told me that particular enquiry could  not  be\r\n\r\nfound  on this website.  And she gave me the name of  another\r\n\r\nURL,  just to search for the bona fide of an intended foreign\r\n\r\nworker.  Sir, I could not understand why the URL could not be\r\n\r\nhyperlinked  to  the MOM's website in the first  place.   The\r\n\r\nlogical thing is that, if this is available at MOM, it should\r\n\r\nbe  linked  to  the  website.   MOM  should  not  claim  that\r\n\r\npotential employers or landlords can easily go to the website\r\n\r\nto  check on the validity of foreign worker permits when  the\r\n\r\ninformation they themselves give to the public are  sometimes\r\n\r\nskimpy and also time consuming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after gaining access to the second website on this\r\n\r\nURL  given  by  the  officer, I was again  frustrated  in  my\r\n\r\nattempts  to solicit the information I want because  my  NRIC\r\n\r\nNo.  was rejected as I did not type in the prefix \"S\"  before\r\n\r\nit.   Sir,  our NRIC Nos. are unique numbers and there  is  a\r\n\r\ncomputer to take care of all this.  I do not see why we  need\r\n\r\nto  key in the prefix, whether it is \"F\", \"P\" or \"S\", and  if\r\n\r\nyou do not key in \"S\", you can never get the service.   Also,\r\n\r\nrequiring  the  foreign  worker's  identification  number  is\r\n\r\nanother  exercise  of  testing  the  limits  of  the   user's\r\n\r\npatience.  Why must it have to be the so-called FIN  numbers,\r\n\r\ngiven  by the Ministry, and not the worker's passport number,\r\n\r\nfor  example.   Sir,  perhaps, I would  like  to  invite  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to try going online himself to test out the  system\r\n\r\nand see for himself why much more improvements are necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Inland Revenue Authority, IRAS, is encouraging\r\n\r\ntaxpayers to submit their returns online.  While it boasts of\r\n\r\nsome  successes, I am not the person who uses it, but I  have\r\n\r\nfeedback  that it could have been more simpler and easier  to\r\n\r\nuse.   For instance, taxpayers need not have to do paperwork,\r\n\r\nor  must  have paperwork done first before they go online  to\r\n\r\nkey in all the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninformation  from the worksheet which they have  to  complete\r\n\r\nbeforehand.  Sir, if the system is user-friendly enough,  you\r\n\r\njust  key  in  all  the information and the  computer  should\r\n\r\nactually  work out the worksheet and tell you  what  is  your\r\n\r\ntax, without having to do the worksheet beforehand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all said and done, I firmly believe that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must have some form of audit of  all  its  online\r\n\r\nservices   to   streamline  them  so  that  all   claims   of\r\n\r\naccessibility  can be truly materialised.  If efficiency  and\r\n\r\neffectiveness of the Government are to be upheld, a  rigorous\r\n\r\naudit  is inevitable and mandatory to ensure that we rise  to\r\n\r\nthe  challenge  and  this is really sharpening  our  nation's\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge through the use of IT.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, after the\r\n\r\nFinance   Minister's  Budget  speech,  the   Prime   Minister\r\n\r\nexpressed  to a few of us in the House that he was  surprised\r\n\r\nat  the  somewhat  muted  response  by  the  Members  present\r\n\r\nalthough  the Budget, by all means, is an exceptionally  good\r\n\r\none,  more so against the backdrop of political and  economic\r\n\r\nuncertainties  in  this region.  Could it  be  that  we  have\r\n\r\ngotten so used to expecting positive budgets year after  year\r\n\r\nthat  we  take  it  for granted that a good budget  would  be\r\n\r\ndelivered at each session.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's generous budget, all Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nwhether the well-off or the not so well-off, benefited.  What\r\n\r\nis  more significant is the much greater apportionment of the\r\n\r\nbudget being given to education, social welfare, training and\r\n\r\nassistance  to start-up companies and local businesses.   Why\r\n\r\nthe  subdued response?  Does it mean that the population  has\r\n\r\ngrown  soft with years of good progress and prosperity?   How\r\n\r\ndoes  it affect our competitiveness in the future during this\r\n\r\ntime of global uncertainty and growing regional turmoil?  Can\r\n\r\nwe  afford to be complacent?  We are fortunate that  we  have\r\n\r\nenjoyed stability and sustained strong economic growth  at  a\r\n\r\ntime when\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome  of  our  neighbours are still fighting desperately  for\r\n\r\nsurvival.  We should take this opportunity to consolidate and\r\n\r\nstrengthen  ourselves  in  order to  remain  competitive  and\r\n\r\ninnovative  and stay as one of the major economic players  in\r\n\r\nthe global arena.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last Parliament sitting, BG George Yeo\r\n\r\nindicated  that  the impression that the GLCs dominated  over\r\n\r\nSingapore businesses was erroneous.  The GLCs are responsible\r\n\r\nfor  only  12.9% of our GDP growth and the MNCs actually  are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the major percentage, nearly 40%.   However,\r\n\r\nthat  does little to change the perception of the GLCs  being\r\n\r\nso  dominant in the local business scene.  It may be  because\r\n\r\nof  the  only  presence of the GLCs among all  businesses  in\r\n\r\nSingapore that leads to this conclusion.  The fact that  GLCs\r\n\r\nare  involved  in  almost  all  types  of  business,  be   it\r\n\r\nmanufacturing,  retail,  property, construction,  consultancy\r\n\r\nservices, transportation, communication, finance, etc,  leads\r\n\r\nto the perception that they are in competition with all local\r\n\r\nprivate businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one cannot question the policy of building world-class operations that can compete in the regional arena for\r\n\r\nthe  survival  of Singapore, a nation without much  resources\r\n\r\nand land mass.  This policy is arguably correct as one of the\r\n\r\nmost  expedient ways of building such corporations is by  the\r\n\r\nsetting  up  of GLCs because of their ability to  amass  huge\r\n\r\nfinancial  as well as human resources.  The success  achieved\r\n\r\nby  corporations, like the SIA, PSA, ST, Telecom,  NOL,  DBS,\r\n\r\nand  many  others, that have made their mark  in  the  global\r\n\r\narena,  is  proof of the farsighted policy of our Government.\r\n\r\nVery few, if any private businesses, can have the ability  or\r\n\r\nthe economic capacity to achieve what some of these companies\r\n\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Technologies have continuously ventured into\r\n\r\nprojects which require large economic resources and long-term\r\n\r\ninvestment,  the latest being in the field of life  sciences.\r\n\r\nJTC's   setting  up  of  wafer  fabrication  industries   and\r\n\r\nspearheading the petrochemical industry in Jurong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIsland are among some of the shining examples.  For Singapore\r\n\r\nto   survive   and   remain  competitive,   we   need   these\r\n\r\norganisations  to  venture  into  new  businesses,  and   R&D\r\n\r\nprojects  can be the pioneer for others to follow.   However,\r\n\r\nwhile  recognising  the GLC's role in  nation  building,  one\r\n\r\nshould  not  totally  ignore the contribution  of  the  local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that, consistent with the policy of nurturing\r\n\r\nlocal  entrepreneurs, the Government has come  up  with  many\r\n\r\nassistance   schemes  and  incentives  to  help   the   local\r\n\r\nbusinesses  to  grow.  But the Government has to  be  mindful\r\n\r\nthat  these  entrepreneurs  need  space  and  scope  and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, assistance from the Government to succeed.   These\r\n\r\nbusinesses which are in direct competition with the GLCs  may\r\n\r\nfind  it  very  difficult to survive as the  GLCs,  with  the\r\n\r\nstrength  and  financial resources, not to mention  the  very\r\n\r\nwidespread  networking, can put them out of business  easily.\r\n\r\nI  am  not suggesting that the GLCs should be limited in  the\r\n\r\nscope  of their involvement or be prevented from freely going\r\n\r\ninto any type of businesses they choose.  But there should be\r\n\r\na certain balance to consider whether they need to spread the\r\n\r\nbusiness  venture so widely and freely and enter  into  areas\r\n\r\nwhere  traditionally  our  medium and  small  businesses  are\r\n\r\ntrying to survive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always stressed that, as long as the\r\n\r\nplaying  field is level, everyone should be free to  compete.\r\n\r\nBut,  in reality, in any competition between GLCs and private\r\n\r\nbusinesses, very often, the feeling of the private sector  is\r\n\r\nthat, although the field may be level, they are playing  with\r\n\r\nnine or 10 players against 11.  There would always be a great\r\n\r\nimbalance  in the competition.  To illustrate my point,  NTUC\r\n\r\nFairprice  is doing a tremendous job in operating a  business\r\n\r\nas  a  workers'  cooperative, bringing  in  benefits  to  all\r\n\r\nSingaporean  workers,  as  well  as  ensuring  stability   of\r\n\r\nessential commodities.  Let us say that they suddenly  decide\r\n\r\nto corner all retail business in the HDB heartland and put  a\r\n\r\nsupermarket in all our neighbourhood centres.  Surely our HDB\r\n\r\nshops would never be able to survive against them because  of\r\n\r\ntheir size, human as well\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  financial resources, and eventually, all will  be  driven\r\n\r\nout  of business.  I am sure NTUC has no intention whatsoever\r\n\r\nof  doing  that  even  if it means that  it  can  expand  its\r\n\r\nbusiness and turn out a better bottomline.  Therefore, it can\r\n\r\nbe  reasonably  assumed  that any  GLC,  with  its  financial\r\n\r\nresources and, more importantly, its networking, which  wants\r\n\r\nto  compete  in any local businesses in Singapore,  it  would\r\n\r\nhave  no  difficulty  in overwhelming the local  competitors.\r\n\r\nThe question is:  is it desirable to jeopardise the long-term\r\n\r\nobjective  of having a strong public and private  sector  co-existing with each other as the twin engine that would  drive\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore economy?  Therefore, it would be good  if  the\r\n\r\nGLCs  could concentrate in areas where the enhanced resources\r\n\r\nand  expertise would maximise their potential and performance\r\n\r\nin ways that a local private business would find difficult in\r\n\r\nmatching,  for  instance, in the international  arena  or  in\r\n\r\ncertain niche areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venturing into new fields and R&D projects can open new\r\n\r\nbusiness  opportunities for Singapore and, together with  the\r\n\r\ninput  of the local entrepreneurs, both can flourish side  by\r\n\r\nside.  It would be a sad day if our younger generation do not\r\n\r\nsee  any  future in the private sector and their only  option\r\n\r\nafter  their  graduation is to enter the civil  service,  the\r\n\r\nGLCs  or  the multinationals.  I am sure this is not what  is\r\n\r\nbest  for  Singapore and not what the Government's policy  is\r\n\r\naiming for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot help feeling that there still exists this\r\n\r\nperception  of a great divide between the private and  public\r\n\r\nsectors.  This is not healthy, nor is it desirable.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  continue seeing all Singaporeans, be  they  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  or private sector, working together for the  good  of\r\n\r\nthe  nation.   All  Singaporeans  should  have  a  sense   of\r\n\r\nbelonging and the opportunity to excel in whatever field  and\r\n\r\nwhichever sector they feel most comfortable in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to participate in this debate, and I rise  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  Budget  for financial  year  2001  and  the\r\n\r\nfinancial policy that underpins it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has pointed out that the Budget debate\r\n\r\nis a time when we take stock of the economy and the direction\r\n\r\nthat we have taken.  The debate is also a time for us to take\r\n\r\nnew  bearings for Singapore.  What kind of society do we want\r\n\r\nto  create for Singapore and what are the values that we want\r\n\r\nto  promote?   As  we  move into the new millennium,  we  are\r\n\r\ncognizant that Singapore is caught up in a transition as  the\r\n\r\neconomy adapts to the changes of the global economy where, as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  has  put it, the main drivers  of  growth  are\r\n\r\nknowledge and talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes are not always welcome. This is often the case\r\n\r\nwith  those  who  are not able to cope.  For the  middle-aged\r\n\r\nworkers  who are caught in the middle, economic restructuring\r\n\r\nand realignment would mean potential job displacement and  an\r\n\r\nuncertain  future.   For  the small and  medium  enterprises,\r\n\r\ntheir  inability to cope with competition brought  on  by  an\r\n\r\nincrease in the number and presence of the bigger players  in\r\n\r\nthe industry, means declining business and a bleak outlook.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need look no further than to consider the\r\n\r\npresent   plight   of  some  of  the   shops   in   the   HDB\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods.  We have been assured by the  Minister  that,\r\n\r\nin  the  new  millennium,  there is  a  place  for  everyone.\r\n\r\nInvariably,  the  question to some, if not  many,  has  been:\r\n\r\nwhat  does it mean for them?  Can we assure them that in  the\r\n\r\nmidst  of  this uncertainty brought on by the global economic\r\n\r\nchanges,  the  dawn  of the future would bring  about  better\r\n\r\ntimes  for  them,  while those who have run  on  ahead  would\r\n\r\ncontinue  to blaze the trail for those who are struggling  to\r\n\r\nfollow?  We are faced with the basic question that the budget\r\n\r\nprovides the opportune time for us to ask:  how can we ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  future of Singapore would always have a place  for\r\n\r\nevery Singaporean, young and old, rich and poor?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that, at its most basic level,\r\n\r\nglobalisation means, to many of us, liberalisation  of  trade\r\n\r\nand  greater  competition for businesses and resources.   Our\r\n\r\nresponse is equally clear.  We must ride with the tide or  be\r\n\r\nwashed  away by the currents of change.  This is  evident  in\r\n\r\nthe way we sought to liberalise our economy to facilitate the\r\n\r\nfree  movement  of  labour  and  capital.   Our  economy   is\r\n\r\nrelatively  open  to investments.  Sir, there  are  very  few\r\n\r\nimpediments to foreigners investing in Singapore, other  than\r\n\r\nthose   relating  to  business  viability.   We  have  openly\r\n\r\nencouraged  talented  foreigners to take  up  employment  and\r\n\r\nresidence  here  in  Singapore, and in the  hope  that  their\r\n\r\nskills and talents will help add to the talent pool here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, globalisation is very much driven by the\r\n\r\neconomics of pragmatism.  Our policies largely ebb and  flow,\r\n\r\naccording to the tide of dollars and cents.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nwe  allow  cost  effectiveness  to  dictate  and  decide  our\r\n\r\npolicies.   It  must be.  Competition in the  global  economy\r\n\r\nrequires  us  to  ensure high profitability through  constant\r\n\r\nshifts  in  business operations, on the basis  of  costs  and\r\n\r\nprofitability  margins.  Where foreign labour is  cheaper  to\r\n\r\nhire  than  local  ones, we hire foreign labour.   Where  the\r\n\r\nindustries no longer yield the necessary value-add to  ensure\r\n\r\nhigh  economic growth, we abandon them.  Just look around  us\r\n\r\ntoday.    Textile   factories  are  almost  non-existent   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  I do not suppose there are  many  electrical\r\n\r\nappliance  assembly operations remaining.   Similarly,  there\r\n\r\nare not many canning factories left here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the labour front, the importation of skilled\r\n\r\nconstruction labour, at a fraction of what it would have cost\r\n\r\nto  hire  the  equivalent  of  local  workers,  has  but  all\r\n\r\ndisplaced  our  own  people with similar skill  sets.   Soon,\r\n\r\nthere  will be very few Singaporeans left who are capable  of\r\n\r\ndoing  masonry  work, or carpenters who  can  undertake  form\r\n\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intense market competition, brought on by our\r\n\r\nrelentless pursuit of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  efficiency, has left a mark on our population.   It\r\n\r\nis  not  by accident that we have acquired the dubious honour\r\n\r\nof  being one of the most kiasu societies.  We became a kiasu\r\n\r\nsociety only because our competitive spirit permeates to  all\r\n\r\nlevels of society, practically from cradle to grave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not deny the benefits of an open economy\r\n\r\ndriven  by  competition.  The benefits of that ideology  are,\r\n\r\nwith the collapse of communism, without doubt.  However, what\r\n\r\nis the cost to society?  What is the cost to Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one level, there is the social cost. By allowing a\r\n\r\nfree  flow  of talent, we tend to displace Singaporeans  from\r\n\r\nthe  employment that they would otherwise have  enjoyed,  but\r\n\r\nfor   the   redundancy  made  possible  by   cheaper   labour\r\n\r\nalternatives.  In the scheme of things, those who are middle-aged  and with limited education, are most at risk to  having\r\n\r\ntheir  employment  services  terminated  prematurely.    Such\r\n\r\npremature  termination of employment would  invariably  cause\r\n\r\nsome dislocation to their family, especially when a displaced\r\n\r\nemployee  has a wife and children to support.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nit would be the children who suffer.  What this would mean is\r\n\r\nthat there would invariably be cutbacks on tuition, music and\r\n\r\nother  enrichment  classes  and holidays,  perhaps  overseas.\r\n\r\nThis may, in turn, affect their development in every sense of\r\n\r\nthe word, and affect the future of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we speak of unemployment, it is not just the\r\n\r\nemployee  who is affected, but a whole chain of  people  down\r\n\r\nthe  line  as  well.   So,  when we speak  of  helping  these\r\n\r\nemployers to make adjustments to the new economy, we must  be\r\n\r\nmindful of the urgency that is required to act on this matter\r\n\r\nsince  there are other lives involved as well.  That  is  one\r\n\r\npossible cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At another level, we have the economic cost. Labour\r\n\r\ntends  always to gravitate towards sources of high wages  and\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  social advancement.  As  we  become  more\r\n\r\nglobalised,  we realise that the labour of our people  cannot\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontained   in   our   territorial  boundaries   alone.    As\r\n\r\nopportunities exist elsewhere, our people would  be  under  a\r\n\r\nstrong temptation to seek out these opportunities there.   In\r\n\r\nthis  free  society, there is little we can do to stop  them.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that while our people get displaced at the\r\n\r\nbottom  because  of  the  inability to  compete  with  others\r\n\r\nelsewhere,  there are others at the top who are  prepared  to\r\n\r\nseek  their fortunes outside of Singapore.  Their skill  sets\r\n\r\nand  talents  are  such that they would not  have  a  problem\r\n\r\ngetting  employment in the financial centres of New  York  or\r\n\r\nLondon,  or  in  the  information technology  houses  in  the\r\n\r\nSilicon   Valley  or  teaching  positions  in   Ivy   Leagues\r\n\r\nuniversities in the US.  There is, therefore, this  potential\r\n\r\nfor hollowing out of precious limited talents that we have in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  which we will have to replace,  either  from  the\r\n\r\nyounger members of our population or from other parts of  the\r\n\r\nworld.   Indeed, as our forebears had done in the past,  they\r\n\r\nhad  migrated  from  China and India, so, too,  unless  their\r\n\r\nroots   are   deeply  planted  in  Singapore,   our   younger\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  may  likewise follow suit, except,  this  time,\r\n\r\nthey will be moving out of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we hire people from outside of Singapore, in part to\r\n\r\nfill  in  the shoes of Singaporeans who should be  taking  up\r\n\r\nthis  employment.  The net result in substitution is that  we\r\n\r\ndo  not have a steady base of locally qualified employees who\r\n\r\nare  committed to this country.  In other words,  we  end  up\r\n\r\nwith  foreigners providing the talents for some  of  the  key\r\n\r\nservices in our economy and not just the manual labour.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  fine  as  long as we are able to  sustain  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth and provide the base of political stability.  However,\r\n\r\nif future conditions prove unstable, we cannot count on these\r\n\r\npeople to remain behind for us.  If this comes to pass,  Sir,\r\n\r\nI think we will have a problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, Sir, we are partly to blame for this state of\r\n\r\naffairs.   For  want of a better description,  the  basis  on\r\n\r\nwhich  we  govern  our relationship tends to be  contractual,\r\n\r\neven if the basis of the relationship is understandable.   We\r\n\r\ncontract with students to send them overseas for a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngood  education in exchange for the promise of  service  when\r\n\r\nthey  graduate.   If they do not perform their  side  of  the\r\n\r\nbargain,  we  claim damages and we shame them  publicly.   We\r\n\r\nhire good people for the upper end of the public service.  We\r\n\r\ntry  them for a few years and, if they do not succeed or they\r\n\r\nare  not  suitable, I believe we will tell them to  look  for\r\n\r\ntheir careers elsewhere.  So relationship with our people  is\r\n\r\noften  kept strictly to contract and are, therefore, economic\r\n\r\nin nature.  Sir, as with any economic relationship, one tends\r\n\r\nto  be calculating.  For the young bright Singaporean looking\r\n\r\nat the future ahead of him and where the world is his oyster,\r\n\r\nhe will soon wise up and ask himself, \"What is in it for me?\"\r\n\r\nHe will obviously be doing his sums and decide what is in his\r\n\r\nbest  economic  interest.  Can we count on  him  to  put  the\r\n\r\nnational consideration before himself?  I would like to, Sir,\r\n\r\nbut I doubt it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By defining success purely in material terms, we have\r\n\r\ninadvertently raised one generation of young Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nare  dedicated to the god of conspicuous consumption.  Driven\r\n\r\nby  a  deep-seated  materialism, many of our  best  and  most\r\n\r\ncapable  will  continue to leave our  shores  to  seek  their\r\n\r\nfortunes  elsewhere.  This will have the effect of  depleting\r\n\r\nour talent pool even further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is, therefore, not just a problem of workers\r\n\r\ncontinually  learning  new  skills  and  working  in  a   new\r\n\r\nenvironment that we have to grapple with.  It is, I submit, a\r\n\r\ndeeper  set of problems derived from globalisation, how  this\r\n\r\nwill  affect  our workers, their families, the likely  impact\r\n\r\nthat this will have on the future of Singaporeans and on  the\r\n\r\nlimited talent pool that we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is also the issue of the political cost\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  faced with.  Sir, there is evidence  that  the\r\n\r\nincome  gap between the top income earners and those  at  the\r\n\r\nbottom  has widened in Singapore.  That this is so is  not  a\r\n\r\nsurprise.  Globalisation has brought about greater\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompetition  for people and talent across boundaries.   Where\r\n\r\ntalent  is in short supply, market forces have dictated  that\r\n\r\npremium salaries would go to them.  On the one hand, the same\r\n\r\ncannot  be said of unskilled labour.  An unskilled worker  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  working  in a low-technology  assembly  operation\r\n\r\nhere,  will find it difficult to compete with his counterpart\r\n\r\nin China or in India.  On the other hand, a highly skilled IT\r\n\r\nprofessional,  who is Singaporean, will be in demand  by  the\r\n\r\nMNC who is prepared to pay top dollars for his services.  The\r\n\r\nresult, unfortunately, has been a widening of the income  gap\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two.   Yet simple economics tells  us  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot  artificially prop up wages for those from the working\r\n\r\nclass  in  order to narrow the gap, unless we want  to  price\r\n\r\nourselves out of competition.  Against the backdrop of rising\r\n\r\nprices  and the cost of living, the growing income  disparity\r\n\r\nwill,  no  doubt, add to the growth of discontentment  within\r\n\r\nour  society.   We will, no doubt, begin to see  the  age-old\r\n\r\nconflict between the haves and the have-nots rearing its ugly\r\n\r\nhead again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement by the Government, that our workers must\r\n\r\ngo  for  training and retraining in order to  increase  their\r\n\r\nproductivity  and  wages,  has  almost  become  a  motherhood\r\n\r\nstatement  in Singapore.  The deeper issue is:   how  can  we\r\n\r\nensure  that,  with training, our workers can be  assured  of\r\n\r\nbetter  paying  jobs  and  a more  secure  future?   Can  the\r\n\r\ninherent   discrimination  against  older   retrenched,   but\r\n\r\ntrained, workers seeking re-employment be overcome?  Has  the\r\n\r\nGovernment looked into and dealt with this issue?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we accept the foregoing arguments, then it\r\n\r\nfollows  that our financial policy should also be  skewed  to\r\n\r\naddress  these  problems  raised.  For  instance,  would  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  consider the possibility of giving some  form  of\r\n\r\ntax  rebates  to  companies which  employ  older  workers  or\r\n\r\nretrenched   workers?   Additionally,  should   special   tax\r\n\r\nconcessions   be  considered  to  attract  highly   qualified\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  return to Singapore to  contribute  to  the\r\n\r\ngrowth of our country?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making this submission, Sir, I know that the answers\r\n\r\nmay  not  always be there readily for us.  However,  as  they\r\n\r\nsay,  the journey of a thousand miles always begins with  the\r\n\r\nfirst step.  I hope the Government will take that first step.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support the FY 2001 Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, firstly, to commend the Minister for what\r\n\r\nhas  been  described  by  many as  the  \"best  ever\"  Budget.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  whilst  providing something  for  all  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nbusinesses, SMEs, individuals and families, this  Budget  has\r\n\r\nstruck  a  fine  balance.  It sets the fiscal  tone  for  the\r\n\r\nfuture   economic  development  of  Singapore,  as  well   as\r\n\r\naddresses  some  pressing concerns in  our  current  economic\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, I am greatly encouraged by the\r\n\r\nemphasis that the Minister has placed on the smaller  members\r\n\r\nof  society.  The tax cuts for individuals, for instance, are\r\n\r\nnot   the  flat-rate  type  cuts  that  provide  the  biggest\r\n\r\nwindfalls  to  the rich, but were structured to  benefit  the\r\n\r\nlower and middle-income taxpayers most; whilst, the corporate\r\n\r\ntax  relief  is structured to benefit, in greater proportion,\r\n\r\nsmall  businesses which have felt the heat from globalisation\r\n\r\nand greater competition most.\r\n\r\nI  am  particularly heartened by the fact that  non-taxpayers\r\n\r\nalso  share  in  the surplus built up by the Government  last\r\n\r\nyear.   For example, the $333 million rebates on HDB  service\r\n\r\nand  conservancy charges, as well as savings in  rentals  and\r\n\r\nutilities  in  addition to CPF top-ups, are not only  timely,\r\n\r\nbut  crucial  to  maintain the social fabric that  keeps  and\r\n\r\nbinds our nation together.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to stress that it is equally\r\n\r\nimportant that the right incentive structures are in place in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  enable the right environment  for  creativity,\r\n\r\nrisk   taking  and  entrepreneurship,  without   creating   a\r\n\r\ndependency effect for the less successful members of  society\r\n\r\non the better-off.  The welfare methods\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  were a hallmark of many European societies of the  past\r\n\r\nand  the  fiscal  drain on big governments by many  state-run\r\n\r\nprogrammes clearly drained resources and dis-incentivised the\r\n\r\nable to produce more, is certainly not the route for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the reduction of personal and corporate taxes is\r\n\r\nsignificant in that it sends the right signal to Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand  foreigners alike who may be further encouraged  to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore  their  home.  Ultimately, it is not  increases  in\r\n\r\nGovernment spending per se that should be the support for any\r\n\r\neconomy,  rather the creation of the right long term  regimes\r\n\r\nto  align  incentives for individuals and companies  to  take\r\n\r\ngreater risks and produce more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst I applaud the Minister for delivering a good\r\n\r\nBudget,  I have a few questions to raise.  The first question\r\n\r\nreflects  the  concerns  many  Singaporeans  have  over   the\r\n\r\nworsening  state of the world economy today.   In  the  short\r\n\r\nterm, it does look like the flu that the US economy seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  suffering  from has already affected some of  our  global\r\n\r\ncompanies,  particularly those in the  electronics  industry.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has managed to accumulate surpluses  in  years  of\r\n\r\nplenty,  running budget surpluses even whilst the  Government\r\n\r\nhad  embarked  on an expansionary fiscal policy to  stimulate\r\n\r\nthe  economy  in the last two financial years.  However,  now\r\n\r\nthat  we  are reducing direct tax rates, will this limit  the\r\n\r\nability  or  desire  of the Government to provide  more  off-budget  measures  to  stimulate the economy  in  the  future?\r\n\r\nShould  the  flu  that  the  US  economy  has  caught  become\r\n\r\nprolonged, spreading rapidly here, we may have to do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the best economists and analysts were all\r\n\r\ncaught off guard in December 2000 when the US economy started\r\n\r\nto  cool and it was only recently that institutions like  the\r\n\r\nG7 and IMF have started revising downwards the world economic\r\n\r\ngrowth with the potential for more shocks to come.  There  is\r\n\r\nperhaps a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed  for Singaporeans to understand and be assured that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  stands ready should the 5-7 % GDP growth  targets\r\n\r\nthat MTI has set for this year not materialise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, it was only 2-3 weeks ago that the Turkish\r\n\r\nLira was devalued, and ominously, just like Thailand in 1997,\r\n\r\nthe  consensus expectation is that there will be no contagion\r\n\r\neffect,  even though Eastern Europe has started to  feel  the\r\n\r\nchill  already.    A  lower tax burden, as the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nrightly pointed out, will help businesses and individuals  to\r\n\r\nsome  degree.  However, it does not go very far  if  revenues\r\n\r\nare  falling or jobs are lost.  Potentially, a revisit of the\r\n\r\nglobal crisis in 1998 could arise, except that this time, the\r\n\r\nUS,  which has almost single-handedly consumed the world  out\r\n\r\nfrom the recession then, takes the lead downwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister if the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does stand ready to do more for  the  economy  if\r\n\r\nindeed  the  US  and the global economy slips into  recession\r\n\r\nthis  year.   Has  the  Government  a  contingency  plan   or\r\n\r\nsupplementary budget ready?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second question that I have concerns GST. We\r\n\r\nunderstand that when the GST policy was introduced some years\r\n\r\nago,  the  longer  term stated goal of the Government  is  to\r\n\r\nstrike a balance between direct and indirect taxes.  There is\r\n\r\na  concern now that with the reduction in direct personal and\r\n\r\ncorporate  taxes, the Government may increase indirect  taxes\r\n\r\nthrough GST.  Could the Minister therefore elaborate on  what\r\n\r\nthe  plans  are for GST, and if and when should  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nexpect  further  increases in GST, and  will  it  be  met  by\r\n\r\nequally  significant reductions in personal income  taxes  in\r\n\r\nfuture?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question concerns the allocation of the \"share\r\n\r\nouts\" from the budget surplus.  It has been widely publicised\r\n\r\nthat  escalating  health care cost is  one  of  the  greatest\r\n\r\npressing  concerns  of  working adults,  and  especially  for\r\n\r\nsenior citizens\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwithout a stable income.  The $10 rise in Singapore Allowance\r\n\r\nfor  pensioners, for example, will not go very  far  to  help\r\n\r\nmeet many co-payment schemes by health care providers.  Would\r\n\r\nit  therefore not be more appropriate to consider  allocating\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  top-up,  not to the Ordinary account,  but  to  the\r\n\r\nMedisave  account and to re-balance the planned  contribution\r\n\r\nfrom the surplus to the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund  and\r\n\r\nthe  Medical Endowment Fund in order to address the  pressing\r\n\r\nneed  for the aged in meeting their medical expenses  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, on a more specific matter, in view of the\r\n\r\nrecognition  of the need for Singaporeans to be part  of  the\r\n\r\nKBE  and to embark on lifelong learning, would it not be more\r\n\r\nappropriate  to  review the current cap  on  tax  relief  for\r\n\r\neducation  course  fees, currently set at  $2,500  per  year?\r\n\r\nSir,  I believe this level has not caught pace with the rapid\r\n\r\nrise  in  costs  of  tertiary and professional  education  in\r\n\r\nrecent  years  and  is incongruous to the emphasis  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has placed to encourage Singaporeans  to  upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir skills and education.  I therefore urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider   revising  upwards  this  quantum,   to   encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to upgrade their skills and education  in  order\r\n\r\nto keep pace with global economic demands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to reiterate and elaborate on\r\n\r\nthe  feelings  on the ground and on the part of  many  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituents.   Whilst  MTI  and  the  Government  have  been\r\n\r\noptimistic   of  Singapore's  continued  growth  this   year,\r\n\r\nfollowing the rapid recovery in our economy in the  last  two\r\n\r\nfinancial  years, there is considerable concern amongst  many\r\n\r\ncitizens  that the benefits of recovery have not  been  fully\r\n\r\nfelt   across   the  board.   Many  small  businesses,   like\r\n\r\nretailers,  HDB shopkeepers, market stallholders,  etc,  have\r\n\r\nnot  seen  a  discernible increase in business  activity  and\r\n\r\nwhilst we have not suffered the fate of Hong Kong and the  UK\r\n\r\nin  the  early 1990s, where many households actually suffered\r\n\r\nfrom negative equity in their household mortgages, there  has\r\n\r\ncertainly been some contraction in our asset prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst many of these developments are symptomatic of the\r\n\r\nunderlying changes in the structure of the economy, part  and\r\n\r\nparcel  of  market  adjustment and  globalisation,  they  all\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  the  lack of confidence,  and  perception  of\r\n\r\nuncertainty in the times ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to commend the Minister for\r\n\r\naddressing  some of these concerns in this Budget  which  has\r\n\r\ncertainly  underlined  the commitment of  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nbridge the gap and to give more support to the have-nots  and\r\n\r\nthe  less well-off in the form of incentives to help them  to\r\n\r\ndo  better  and, at the same time, encourage the able  to  do\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the measures that the Minister has\r\n\r\npresented  in  this Budget will certainly go  to  help  those\r\n\r\nsegments  of our society that most require it, ie, the  lower\r\n\r\nand  the  middle wage incomes, the small businesses  and  the\r\n\r\nfledging  technopreneur sector. With more disposable  income,\r\n\r\nhopefully,   it   would  stimulate  spending   and   business\r\n\r\nactivities and perhaps enhance job creation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end by quoting a saying from the\r\n\r\nlate John F. Kennedy, \"if a free society cannot help the many\r\n\r\nwho  are  poor, it cannot save the few who are  rich\".   This\r\n\r\nBudget  has  sent  the  message  to  our  citizens  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has a heart for its people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, this year's Budget is\r\n\r\ncharacterised  by  a strong sense of investor  confidence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  which  has  been contributed,  to  a  very  large\r\n\r\nextent,  by  the discipline and sacrifice of our workers  and\r\n\r\nour  good  governance.   I am glad that  the  Government  has\r\n\r\ndecided  to reward our workers for their sacrifices and  help\r\n\r\nemployers  to  enhance  their  competitiveness  through  this\r\n\r\nyear's  Budget.   Perhaps, because  of  the  good  spread  of\r\n\r\ngoodies  this  year,  the  press  was  almost  unanimous   in\r\n\r\ndescribing it as \"a generous Budget for everyone\".   I  think\r\n\r\nthey  are  right.  But I would call it a \"Budget  for  Social\r\n\r\nCohesion\"  for the focus it gives, not just to the short-term\r\n\r\nreward for the sacrifices and in helping the lower-income\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans through the rebates, but also in addressing  the\r\n\r\nlong-term need to help Singaporeans, particularly the  lower-skilled   workers,  enhance  their  welfare  through   skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  as  our  economy picks up pace  in  restructuring.\r\n\r\nWith better skills, our workers will be able to enhance their\r\n\r\nemployability and earn higher wages.  Helping our workers  to\r\n\r\nbe employable is a very important welfare assistance to them,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of their income status.  These twin  approaches\r\n\r\nwill  go  a  long  way  to addressing  the  issue  of  income\r\n\r\ndisparities which could affect our social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers, as reflected by the views of our union\r\n\r\nleaders, applaud the Budget. One union leader has called it a\r\n\r\n\"pro-all  Budget\" for the various rebates given away  on  the\r\n\r\nservice  and conservancy charges, utilities and HDB  rentals.\r\n\r\nThese  will benefit the lower-income workers who are  already\r\n\r\nnot  paying  income tax.  Also welcome are  the  lowering  of\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax rates by 2 to 5 percentage  points,  the\r\n\r\ndoubling of personal tax rebate to 10% and higher tax  breaks\r\n\r\non  CPF contributions from the self-employed.  Another  union\r\n\r\nleader feels that all these measures show that the Government\r\n\r\ncares.   I would add that the Government has kept faith  with\r\n\r\nthe  people's  trust in the consultative approach  among  the\r\n\r\nworkers, employers and the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These personal goodies are very important but what is\r\n\r\nequally  significant is Dr Richard Hu's announcement  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's plan to allocate more resources to education and\r\n\r\nto  facilitate lifelong learning among our workers.  This, as\r\n\r\nI  said  earlier,  is  important to help our  workers  remain\r\n\r\nrelevant in the New Economy.  We learnt that last year,  many\r\n\r\nof  the  manufacturing investment commitments of $9.2 billion\r\n\r\nwere    in    key    knowledge-intensive   industries    like\r\n\r\npharmaceuticals  and high-end electronics - areas  that  will\r\n\r\nhelp Singapore's future growth.  We can expect the proportion\r\n\r\nof  jobs that require higher skills will be larger year after\r\n\r\nyear.   Even  though retrenchments fell to 11,500  last  year\r\n\r\ncompared  to 14,600 in 1999, we can expect the proportion  of\r\n\r\nretrenchments due to structural reasons would  be  higher  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is because of this that our union leaders\r\n\r\napplaud  the plan to beef up the Lifelong Learning  Endowment\r\n\r\nFund by another half a billion dollars to $1 billion.  So  is\r\n\r\nthe  allocation  of the $30 million for Manpower  Development\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme, on top of the $6.3 billion  allocated  to\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I join our workers in welcoming this Budget in its\r\n\r\naim  to helping our workers, especially the lower-income  and\r\n\r\nlow-skilled  who  missed out on education  in  their  younger\r\n\r\ndays,  in  making  the  transition  to  the  New  Economy  by\r\n\r\nfacilitating  the  learning  of new  skills.  By  emphasising\r\n\r\nskills upgrading and retraining, the Government has shown its\r\n\r\ncommitment to the long-term welfare of our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, this is a very important commitment to the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  Singaporeans.  If we do not provide and  improve\r\n\r\nthe  facilities and resources for programmes to enhance their\r\n\r\nemployability, especially for the lower-income  workers,  the\r\n\r\nState  will have to provide a more direct welfare scheme  for\r\n\r\nthem in the future.  Our population and workforce are greying\r\n\r\nand   our  people  live  longer.   If  they  are  to   remain\r\n\r\nindependent, they need to be employed.  And they  can  secure\r\n\r\nemployment  only  if they can contribute to companies.   Sir,\r\n\r\ntherefore, we have to help them to gain new skills to  remain\r\n\r\nrelevant.  The social welfare scheme of the West is costly to\r\n\r\nthe  society.  In fact, many Western countries are  modifying\r\n\r\ntheir  schemes.  We should not take the path that others  are\r\n\r\nalready  discarding. That is why I support strongly the  move\r\n\r\nto  beef  up  the  newly set-up  Lifelong Learning  Endowment\r\n\r\nFund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by making a general comment on the\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax  rate.   I  am  glad  that  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nannounced a further cut of 1% point so that our corporate tax\r\n\r\nrate  stands  at 24.5%.  Last year, Dr Hu cut it  by  half  a\r\n\r\npercentage  point.   These measures, I am  sure,  could  help\r\n\r\ncompanies to be more attracted to remain in Singapore or to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncome to invest here.  But competition for investments and for\r\n\r\njobs  is  not  static.   We should watch our  competitiveness\r\n\r\nlevel all the time because many countries could catch up with\r\n\r\nus.  Already Chile, Hong Kong, Hungary and Ireland, to name a\r\n\r\nfew,  have lower corporate tax rates than our 24.5%.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame time, although many countries have higher corporate  tax\r\n\r\nrates  than ours, their effective rates may be comparable  to\r\n\r\nours  as  they have their own systems of rebates.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nSir, looking at these in the package, we have to sharpen  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  edge  in  areas other  than  through  fiscal\r\n\r\nmeasures only.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in the background, I would support this Budget\r\n\r\nwhich  I  would  describe as pro-workers,  pro-people  and  a\r\n\r\nBudget for social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget for this year can be said to be a\r\n\r\ngenerous Budget.  With a budget surplus of $4.3 billion,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is able to distribute some of it to the people, to\r\n\r\nassist those in the lower and middle income group.  With  the\r\n\r\npersonal income tax reduction, it will also reduce the burden\r\n\r\nof  the  taxpayers to meet the rising cost  of  living.   The\r\n\r\nbudget  surplus of $4.8 billion in 1999 and $3.54 billion  in\r\n\r\nthe  year 2000  shows that we are able to manage our  economy\r\n\r\nwell.   It  also shows the effectiveness of our  measures  to\r\n\r\nbring  about  economic  growth.   With  the  cooperation  and\r\n\r\nefforts  made  by all parties, the Government, employers  and\r\n\r\nworkers,  our  economy has grown by 9.9% last  year.   It  is\r\n\r\ntimely  that the Government should share the success  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy with the people through rebates and tax cuts for  the\r\n\r\npeople.   In fact, we can say that every level of the  people\r\n\r\nand  all  sectors of the economy are getting the goodies  and\r\n\r\nincentives mentioned by the Minister for Finance.  The people\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  thank  the Minister  for  Finance  for  this\r\n\r\ngenerous Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Budget this year has been described by\r\n\r\nour businessmen as pro-business.  The reduction of 1% to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n24.5%  for  corporate tax for Year of Assessment 2002  is  to\r\n\r\nmaintain our competitiveness.  It will also reduce the burden\r\n\r\nof  tax by the companies.  What is most interesting to me  is\r\n\r\nthe  exemption of the income tax of 75% for the first $10,000\r\n\r\nof  income and 50% tax reduction for the next $90,000.   This\r\n\r\nstep will benefit the small and medium enterprises.  However,\r\n\r\nbusinessmen are still expecting that the business cost can be\r\n\r\nfurther  reduced to assist those who are facing slow economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  this  year.   It is true that  businessmen  will  pay\r\n\r\nreduced  tax to maintain their competitiveness.  But what  is\r\n\r\nof   concern   to  them  is  the  business  cost,   such   as\r\n\r\ntransportation, payment of levies to the Government, workers'\r\n\r\nwages  and rentals.  Therefore, the Government should  assist\r\n\r\nby  ensuring  that  these  costs of business  will  not  rise\r\n\r\nrapidly.   It is no point to have all the tax cuts  when  our\r\n\r\ncompanies cannot make profits.  I hope the Minister will give\r\n\r\nan  assurance that the Government will take steps to  control\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs.  And I hope that with these measures  taken,\r\n\r\nwe  will be able to attract more investments and  help start-up companies to expand here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the general public, especially those who\r\n\r\nlive  in  HDB  1-  to  3-room flats  welcome  the  rebate  on\r\n\r\nutilities and service and conservancy charges.  These rebates\r\n\r\nwill  assist them to settle their monthly bills.   I  welcome\r\n\r\nthis  measure.  But I hope we should also consider other ways\r\n\r\nwhich are more effective to assist the lower income group  in\r\n\r\nfacing  rising  cost of living.  Maybe we  can  give  them  a\r\n\r\nmonthly  grant to upgrade their skills, so that they will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  secure  a better job  in future and maintain  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.   I  worry  that  the  rebates  which  I  treat  as\r\n\r\nconsumption  may make them feel complacent and  may  lead  to\r\n\r\nwastage.  If a skills upgrading grant is given, I think  this\r\n\r\nis in a way a long- term investment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the crux of this Budget is to prepare the\r\n\r\npeople  to meet the growth in the new era.  Singapore has  to\r\n\r\ncompete with developed countries in the world market.  In the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy (KBE) era, education, training and re-training should be emphasised all the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntime.   Therefore, the allocation for FY2001 of $6.3  billion\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministry of Education is right.  This is the  second\r\n\r\nbiggest  allocation.  This is to equip our students with  the\r\n\r\nnew  economy skills.  The contribution of $500 million to the\r\n\r\nLifelong  Learning Endowment Fund is also for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nWe  are  urging the people to upgrade themselves with  skills\r\n\r\nand knowledge throughout their life to meet the challenges of\r\n\r\nthe  KBE  era.  I fully support the Government's emphasis  on\r\n\r\neducation.   The upgrading of our people is the only  way  to\r\n\r\nimprove  our  economy.    Therefore, we  should  nurture  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of lifelong learning among our people.   We  should\r\n\r\nemphasise  among them that education is a continuing  process\r\n\r\nfrom  cradle to grave.  With lifelong learning, every  person\r\n\r\nwill be able to follow the development, especially in science\r\n\r\nand technology, and they will not be left behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I also notice that out of $6.3 billion\r\n\r\nallotted  for education, $1.4 billion is for the  development\r\n\r\nestimates.   This  amount  is to  build  facilities  such  as\r\n\r\nschools  and other institutes of education.  In view  of  the\r\n\r\nhigh cost of building educational infrastructure, I think the\r\n\r\nFund  should be wisely spent.  What we understand now is that\r\n\r\nmany  schools  are  not  used at  night.   I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will encourage other educational agencies  to  use\r\n\r\nthese  schools  to educate workers who do  not  have  a  high\r\n\r\neducation.   We know that many workers who are 40  years  and\r\n\r\nabove  do  not  have secondary education, up  to  'O'  level.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  could use these schools  to  teach  important\r\n\r\nsubjects  like English, Mathematics and Science,  up  to  'O'\r\n\r\nlevel, for these workers whom I have mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the others, they could also pursue upgrading courses\r\n\r\nwhich  are  below  GCE 'O' level, ie, `N'  level.   If  these\r\n\r\nschools  are  open  at night, the workers  who  live  in  the\r\n\r\nhousing  estates could spare some time, maybe three  times  a\r\n\r\nweek,  to  pursue such courses.  The Government  may  give  a\r\n\r\ngrant  of up to $1 billion to the Lifelong Learning Endowment\r\n\r\nFund,  so  that  the  people will be  able  to  attend  these\r\n\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same will apply to the ITE and polytechnic buildings\r\n\r\nwhich  can be used for technical upgrading courses  that  can\r\n\r\nlift  the  educational  standards  of  our  workers  to   NTC\r\n\r\ncertificates, diploma or higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools and educational institutions are run based\r\n\r\non  meritocracy and multi-racialism.  Students compete  among\r\n\r\nthemselves to achieve the best in education.  The process  of\r\n\r\nmulti-racial  nation  building  is  also  being  carried  out\r\n\r\nactively among the young.  They interact comfortably  in  the\r\n\r\nclassrooms  and  other co-curricular activities  in  schools.\r\n\r\nAlthough  there  are situations of grouping of  the  majority\r\n\r\nrace in a few special schools meant for specific purposes, on\r\n\r\nthe  whole,  our  schools  reflect  the  multi-racialism   of\r\n\r\neducation  in Singapore.  This process enables us to  educate\r\n\r\nour  young  with  good values such as the concept  of  multi-racialism  to guarantee the stability of our society  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   We  can  say that the process of integration  in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society has been going on well in our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of integration, I hope this integration\r\n\r\nprocess  will be carried out smoothly in our housing  estates\r\n\r\nand  the  work  places or in the SAF.  We  hope  one  day  no\r\n\r\nquestion will be raised regarding the issue of loyalty or the\r\n\r\ncontribution of one community towards our sovereign country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, if we had followed the development in\r\n\r\nSingapore, the issue of loyalty and the participation of  the\r\n\r\nMalay  community  in  SAF has become  a  topic  for  dialogue\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Senior Minister and the Malay/Muslim  community\r\n\r\nleaders.   A few young Ministers also attended.  I feel  that\r\n\r\nthis  dialogue is very effective.  It went on with  maturity,\r\n\r\nclarity  and honesty.  In this dialogue, the Malay  community\r\n\r\nhas been urged to immediately participate in this integration\r\n\r\nprocess.   In  my view, this has already happened  where  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  the Malay community have already been  together\r\n\r\nwith  the other communities in their daily lives, whether  in\r\n\r\nthe housing estates, in their workplaces, in schools\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand also at public places.  Therefore, the issue of the Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity  wanting  to  isolate  themselves  from  the  other\r\n\r\ncommunities  should not arise.  What has emerged  now  is  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  identity of the Malays  who  are  Islam  by\r\n\r\nreligion, especially the attire of covering the aurat,  halal\r\n\r\nfood,  payment  of  zakat,  and  performing  their  religious\r\n\r\nobligations  like  the Haj.  The Singapore  community  should\r\n\r\nunderstand that these aspects are obligations which  have  to\r\n\r\nbe  performed  by  the Malay/Muslim community.   They  should\r\n\r\nunderstand   this  much  earlier  to  bring  about   a   more\r\n\r\nunderstanding and cohesive community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I support the policies of the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister in his Budget speech, but I hope more  funds\r\n\r\nwill be given to improve or step up the cohesion of our multi-racial community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The main focus  of\r\n\r\nthis Budget is on the cuts or exemptions on corporate and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npersonal income tax and property tax.  Tax cuts and exemption\r\n\r\nare  means in the use of fiscal policy to stimulate  economic\r\n\r\nexpansion.  In the next one or two years, we will  be  facing\r\n\r\neconomic uncertainty.  This move will positively support  our\r\n\r\neconomic  activities so that our economy will not  turn  from\r\n\r\nsubstantive growth to recession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the middle and higher income people, reduction of\r\n\r\npersonal  income tax rates is like \"adding a  flower  to  the\r\n\r\nbrocade\".  Their incomes are already in the middle  and  high\r\n\r\nbrackets.  Now, with this tax cut, they will have  even  more\r\n\r\nafter-tax disposable income.  To the lower income people, the\r\n\r\ntax  cut  is  of  not much help.  Some may  even  receive  no\r\n\r\nbenefit  at  all.   The lower income people  are  faced  with\r\n\r\nescalating  cost of living such as the rising utility  rates,\r\n\r\nhigh medical cost, increasing education cost, etc.  We should\r\n\r\nalso  think of a hardship-relieving way to approach the issue\r\n\r\nlike  \"sending  burning charcoal in a  snowy  weather\".    Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  $250  to  $350 utilities rebate,  exemption  or\r\n\r\nreduction  in the payment of service and conservancy  charges\r\n\r\nand  HDB rents is a form of help.  But this is trying to \"put\r\n\r\nout a big fire on a cart-load of firewood with a small cup of\r\n\r\nwater\".   It could at most wet your throat but hardly  enough\r\n\r\nto  quench your thirst.  Compared to the benefits enjoyed  by\r\n\r\nthe  middle and higher income people, these benefits  to  the\r\n\r\nlower income people are just pittance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of corporate tax rate from 25.5% to 24.5%\r\n\r\nwill  attract  more  foreign investments  to  Singapore.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  small companies with a profit  of  less  than\r\n\r\n$10,000  enjoy tax relief on 75% of their chargeable  income,\r\n\r\nand 50% of the subsequent $90,000.  This will help the start-up  companies  to have more capital for further  development.\r\n\r\nThese  are  conducive  to Singapore's  strive  to  become  an\r\n\r\ninvestment,  commercial  and trading  centre,  enhancing  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  in attracting foreign investments.  However,\r\n\r\nto  those small businesses which are slumped into predicament\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the regional economies and economic restructure,\r\n\r\nthe  cut in corporate tax does not benefit them nor help them\r\n\r\nto solve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  problems at all.   Many SMEs have no business  or  are\r\n\r\nfinding it difficult to operate their business.  Many of them\r\n\r\nare  running  their business at a loss.  If the companies  do\r\n\r\nnot  make  any profit, income tax cut or exemption is  simply\r\n\r\nirrelevant to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the struggling businesses are the retailers in\r\n\r\nthe HDB estates. Because of their outdated mode of operation,\r\n\r\nthey  are  unable to attract the younger consumers. Moreover,\r\n\r\nwith the modern shopping complexes luring away the customers,\r\n\r\nthese  poor  neighbourhood  shops  have  been  keeping  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  going by painstaking efforts without much  success.\r\n\r\nTo  these  retailers in the HDB estates, this  year's  Budget\r\n\r\ndoes  not  bring any benefit.  The benefit of  tax  reduction\r\n\r\ndoes  not apply to them. There is no reduction in their rent.\r\n\r\nFor those who have bought over the shop premises, the monthly\r\n\r\ninstalment  remains a heavy burden.  There  is  no  utilities\r\n\r\nsubsidy for them.  But, fortunately, the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nhas   already  announced  that  the  Minister  for   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment will introduce a series of measures to help  them\r\n\r\nto tide over the difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, hardship cases are not confined to\r\n\r\nthe  retailers in HDB estates. Even the many shops in  modern\r\n\r\nshopping complexes are having a hard time, with high rentals,\r\n\r\nhigh  overhead expenses and low sales volume.   Although  the\r\n\r\nretail sector is said to have picked up last year, many small\r\n\r\nand  middle  retailers are moaning and groaning.  Apart  from\r\n\r\nretailers, many other sectors are similarly affected by  poor\r\n\r\nbusiness.   Property sector aside,  the related sectors  such\r\n\r\nas  the  renovation  contractors and the general  traditional\r\n\r\nindustries are also facing the problem of very poor business.\r\n\r\nIn   fact,  apart  from  electronics  and  telecommunications\r\n\r\nsectors,  all the other sectors are not doing well.  Business\r\n\r\nmay  be  poor but the cost of doing business remains  on  the\r\n\r\nhigh  side with no sign of going down.   Electricity  tariffs\r\n\r\nare  rising all the time.  CPF contribution rates  have  been\r\n\r\nadjusted  up  by  4%.   Petrol  prices  have  also  shot  up.\r\n\r\nAlthough in this year's Budget, property tax will be  reduced\r\n\r\nfrom 12% to 10% in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nJuly  this  year, the property tax rebate which  was  granted\r\n\r\nearlier would be revoked.  As a result, property tax  has  in\r\n\r\nfact  increased  from 9% to 10%.  It would appear  that  this\r\n\r\nyear's  Budget does not help to reduce the operating cost  of\r\n\r\nthose businesses which are not doing well, nor does it assist\r\n\r\nin  solving their problem.  If we want to effectively  assist\r\n\r\nthem,  I  think  the  Minister for  Finance  should  consider\r\n\r\nlowering  all  the  charges relating to  the  industrial  and\r\n\r\ncommercial  sectors,  for example,  property  tax  should  be\r\n\r\nreduced to 9%, and there should be some form of restraint  on\r\n\r\nthe raising of utilities tariffs.  The Government should also\r\n\r\nexempt  or lower the various charges levied on the small  and\r\n\r\nmiddle enterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has used the tax-cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures to stimulate our economy and to bring about economic\r\n\r\nexpansion and growth.  This is a timely measure.  However, if\r\n\r\nthe  fiscal  policies can be coordinated  with  the  monetary\r\n\r\npolicies,  the effect will surely be better.  At the  moment,\r\n\r\nthere are signs of the US economy declining.  President  Bush\r\n\r\nhas  already  announced  tax cuts and  Mr  Greenspan  of  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Reserves Bureau has also taken steps  to  lower  the\r\n\r\ninterest rates.  Such coordination between the fiscal  policy\r\n\r\nand the monetary policy will surely achieve better results in\r\n\r\nsupporting the US economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's Budget, I do not see any sign of the\r\n\r\nmonetary  policies  being deployed.  In the  next  couple  of\r\n\r\nyears,  if the regional economies do not recover and  the  US\r\n\r\neconomy heads for a decline, Singapore's situation may not be\r\n\r\ntoo  optimistic.  Lowering  of interest  rates  to  encourage\r\n\r\ninvestments and stimulate consumption can be very  useful  in\r\n\r\nsustaining  the economic growth.  Although it  is  said  that\r\n\r\ninterest  rates  are  determined  by  the  commercial   banks\r\n\r\naccording  to market situation, the Minister for Finance  can\r\n\r\nmake  some adjustments to the discount rates and bank capital\r\n\r\nreserve ratio through the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to\r\n\r\navail the banks of more liquidity and cause the whole\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninterest  rate  structure to be adjusted  downwards,  thereby\r\n\r\nlowering  the  cost  of  borrowing  of  the  individuals  and\r\n\r\ncorporations.   On  the one hand, it will stimulate  personal\r\n\r\nconsumption,  and  on  the  other  hand,  it  can  lower  the\r\n\r\noperational   cost  of  businesses.   In   this   way,   both\r\n\r\nconsumption and investment can flourish, and economic  growth\r\n\r\ncan be sustained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget can be said to be a Budget which\r\n\r\n\"adds  a flower to the brocade\". The higher your income,  the\r\n\r\ngreater  tax reduction benefits you will enjoy.  I hope  that\r\n\r\nit  would  simultaneously be a Budget  which  \"sends  burning\r\n\r\ncharcoal  in a snowy weather\".  Reduce or exempt  levies  and\r\n\r\nthe  various charges, lower  the cost of borrowing,  and  cut\r\n\r\ndown  business  cost  to help the suffering  businesses  pull\r\n\r\nthrough these difficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the\r\n\r\nname of the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, year 2001 to 2002 budget is a generous one.  First, huge\r\n\r\nfunds  were given away in the form of year 2001 tax  rebates,\r\n\r\nutilities, rentals and SC&CC charges rebates, CPF top-up  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  contributions  to  the  various  endowment\r\n\r\nfunds.   All  this  will  cost  the  Government  billions  of\r\n\r\ndollars.   This could only be possible because  the  previous\r\n\r\nyear's  budget  had  a surplus of $4.4  billion  due  to  the\r\n\r\nexceptionally and unexpectedly good economic growth that  led\r\n\r\nto  $6.5  billion in additional tax revenue, as  reported  by\r\n\r\nParliament's  Estimates Committee.   We  have  to  thank  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for its generosity in sharing the surplus and  the\r\n\r\nfruits  of  economic success with the people.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, it is also what the people deserve for their sacrifices\r\n\r\nand  contributions  in turning the economy  around  from  the\r\n\r\nAsian  economic  crisis.   It has  also  established  a  good\r\n\r\nprecedence by sharing the budgetary surplus with the  people.\r\n\r\nI  hope the Finance Minister will adopt sharing the budgetary\r\n\r\nsurplus  with  the  people as a standard feature  for  future\r\n\r\nbudgets.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the new tax scheme for personal income tax for\r\n\r\nYear  of  Assessment 2002 offers as much as 30% tax reduction\r\n\r\nfor an annual earned income less than $35,000 and a saving of\r\n\r\n25%  for  an annual earned income of $50,000.  For  the  high\r\n\r\nincome  earners,  they will pay 22% less.  The  huge  cut  in\r\n\r\npersonal income tax is very much more than the usual 10%  tax\r\n\r\nrebate  given out when there was a comfortable budget surplus\r\n\r\nin  the  past.   To do a quick calculation, a typical  family\r\n\r\nwith  an  income of $1,500 per month, living in  a  four-room\r\n\r\npurchase flat, could save up to $730 from the goodies and the\r\n\r\ntax  announced for Year of Assessment 2002.  If  the  minimum\r\n\r\n$500  of  CPF top-up is taken into consideration, the  family\r\n\r\nwill  benefit  $1,230.  Sir, in a practical  way,  it  is  an\r\n\r\namount  good  enough for the family to buy a low-end  Pentium\r\n\r\nIII  computer.  In this case, the household does not need  to\r\n\r\npay  any  income tax, and $1,230 is a direct contribution  as\r\n\r\nincome  to the family.  It is indeed a very generous move  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government in looking after the people in the low-income\r\n\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying low income tax would mean that the people would\r\n\r\nhave  more disposable income.  It would also help, in a small\r\n\r\nway,  to boost the small retail and service industries  which\r\n\r\nwere  not  doing  well  in the past  few  years.   Year  2000\r\n\r\neconomic  performance was not uniform for all  sectors.   The\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry  and  the  small  retail  and  service\r\n\r\nindustries  have still not picked up.  The domestic  industry\r\n\r\ninvolves  quite  a  lot  of  people.   In  good  times,   the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry has a share of about 10%  of  our  GDP.\r\n\r\nOne  could  easily imagine that more than 10% of  our  people\r\n\r\nwork  in  the construction industry because it is  a  labour-intensive industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget, other than what has been mentioned about\r\n\r\nthe  possible  upturn of the construction  industry  and  the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  property  tax by 2%  from  the  original  12%,\r\n\r\nnothing great is being mentioned about how one could help  in\r\n\r\nthe  recovery  of the construction industry.   In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nproperty tax reduction, as mentioned by my colleague, Dr Ker,\r\n\r\nwas  made after adjustment of the property tax rebate.   This\r\n\r\nmeans that for Year of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAssessment  2002, a land owner, property owner  or  developer\r\n\r\nwill  pay  more tax in the form of property tax for  Year  of\r\n\r\nAssessment 2002, as compared with the previous year.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister  will look into  this  again  and  see\r\n\r\nwhether there is any error in the Budget announcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the construction industry has been depressed for\r\n\r\nmany years.  Some of the big construction companies might  be\r\n\r\nfacing financial troubles.  The consequence would be that  we\r\n\r\nmight  weaken  our construction industry which we  had  taken\r\n\r\nyears  to build up to the current stage.  In future,  if  the\r\n\r\ndemand  should  surge,  we might find a  similar  competitive\r\n\r\nelement, exercised in the past, which would not be there  any\r\n\r\nmore  and  the big foreign construction firms might  dominate\r\n\r\nthe market in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the industry create the construction volume is\r\n\r\nthe  only  solution.   On  the one hand,  we  could  consider\r\n\r\nincreasing the public sector projects and, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nwe  could  remove  certain constraints that had  artificially\r\n\r\nsuppressed  the  demand.  Sir, many of  the  anti-speculation\r\n\r\npolicies  in  the  property market were  introduced  in  good\r\n\r\ntimes.  In the post-Asian economic crisis, all these policies\r\n\r\nwill  go  against us and suppress demand.  We  should  either\r\n\r\nlift  some  of these unfavourable policies or take action  to\r\n\r\nquickly  let the property prices reflect its true  values  at\r\n\r\nthe  bottom  of  the V-shape curve and recover  subsequently.\r\n\r\nThe  demand will continue to stay low if property  prices  do\r\n\r\nnot  bottom out.  I would like to see more proactive measures\r\n\r\nby  the  Government to help the construction industry in  its\r\n\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that there is a PSB Retail 21 10-year\r\n\r\nplan  which  is  aimed  at  helping the  retail  industry  in\r\n\r\ntraining,  upgrading and modernisation.  The retail  business\r\n\r\nin  the  traditional HDB estates is lagging behind the modern\r\n\r\nshopping  centres  and  is  facing strong  competition.   The\r\n\r\nassistance  from the Government comes at the right  time.   I\r\n\r\nhope PSB Retail 21 will help the small retail business to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nidentify and overcome their weaknesses, reorganise the  small\r\n\r\nretailers and strengthen their competitive edge to  meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges from the modern retail business in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Budget pays particular attention to the\r\n\r\nrestructuring of our economy.  The fund for the second 5-year\r\n\r\nPlan  allocated  to  NSTB was doubled to $4  billion  and  an\r\n\r\nadditional $7 billion Science and Technology Plan for the R&D\r\n\r\nactivities  for  the next five years.  In the  case  of  life\r\n\r\nsciences, another $1 billion for R&D and $1 billion  for  the\r\n\r\nstart-up fund were allocated.  The size of the funds shows  a\r\n\r\nstrong  commitment  by  the Government in  restructuring  our\r\n\r\neconomy  by  moving  upwards in the value-added  chain.   The\r\n\r\nsuccess  of Singapore's manufacturing sector must  depend  on\r\n\r\nthe continuous innovation of new products and development  of\r\n\r\ncapabilities at the pinnacle of science and technology.   The\r\n\r\nsuccess will help to place Singapore ahead of other countries\r\n\r\nin the region of growth and high value-added areas.  It gives\r\n\r\nSingapore  a  chance  of  success  in  certain  areas   while\r\n\r\ncompeting with the products from the developed countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While emphasising so much on the development of new\r\n\r\nareas,  like  life sciences, we should also not forget  other\r\n\r\nniche  areas,  like  the micro-electronics and  environmental\r\n\r\nengineering.    They  should  continue   to   receive   their\r\n\r\nassistance   like  before,  to  continuously  sharpen   their\r\n\r\ncompetitive   edge.    From   my   experience,   our   fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   always  shy  away  from  the   technical   and\r\n\r\nscientific R&D activities.  Allocated with such a  large  sum\r\n\r\nof  $12  billion  for  the next five  years  for  R&D,  I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned  that  if we did not pay sufficient  attention,  it\r\n\r\nmight  become  an  area  overwhelmingly  dominated  by  Asian\r\n\r\nexpatriates.   We should take sufficient action to  encourage\r\n\r\nmore of our young people to take part in this significant R&D\r\n\r\nprogramme  which  will  have  a very  strong  impact  on  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might have to change our people's perception in the\r\n\r\ncareer  development, reward system and the social  status  of\r\n\r\nR&D  personnel.   Generally,  people  may  have  problems  in\r\n\r\nrecognising  that  there is a career  in  R&D  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  are  no obvious scientific and technological  research\r\n\r\nposts   in   the  public  and  private  sectors.    This   is\r\n\r\nparticularly  true  for the positions of top  scientists  and\r\n\r\nresearch engineers.  The people who are employed for research\r\n\r\nand development work either call themselves as \"engineer\"  or\r\n\r\n\"scientist\".   And it is time that we should  generously  use\r\n\r\nthe job title of research or development engineer or research\r\n\r\nscientist.  This will help to establish in the people's  mind\r\n\r\nthat  scientific research work is a very specific career that\r\n\r\none  could  pursue.   The present reward system  of  offering\r\n\r\nscholarships  in  the university could only attract  students\r\n\r\nfrom  the PRC and India.  It has almost completely failed  to\r\n\r\nattract  Singaporeans  to  do  research  work.   If  we   see\r\n\r\nuniversity  research  training as the entry  point  into  the\r\n\r\nchain of research manpower development, we must study how  we\r\n\r\ncould  attract Singapore researchers.  The aggressive science\r\n\r\nand  technology  plan  given in this  Budget  could  only  be\r\n\r\nconsidered to be a complete success if we could mobilise  and\r\n\r\nattract more young scientists and engineers to take part  and\r\n\r\ncontribute in this programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam pleased with this Budget Statement.  It has been described\r\n\r\nas a generous Budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, budgets used to be described as \"painless\",\r\n\r\nand  when  they  were painless budgets, we were  very  happy.\r\n\r\nAnd,  most of the time, the painless Budget was painless but,\r\n\r\nafter  the  Budget, there would be off-budget measures  where\r\n\r\nthe pain comes in the form of other taxes.  But, now, in this\r\n\r\ngenerous  Budget, we can still hope to listen  to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in his National Day Rally and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhope for more generosity.  If some people describe this as  a\r\n\r\npre-election  Budget,  I  am  very  happy.   And  since   the\r\n\r\nelections need not be held until August 2002, I hope  we  can\r\n\r\nhave  another pre-election budget and, then, it would be even\r\n\r\nmore  generous.   As Singaporeans, we are, of course,  always\r\n\r\ngenerous  in  helping  people in  need,  and  we  also  enjoy\r\n\r\nreceiving generosity from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state why I am quite pleased with this Budget.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  I  think  the contributions  of  the  workers  were\r\n\r\nrecognised.   The  workers took a huge sacrifice  during  the\r\n\r\nrecession,  they  took  the pain and,  now,  when  there  are\r\n\r\nsurpluses,  I think it is right for these to be  returned  to\r\n\r\nthem.  Particularly, the tax exemptions for wage earners  and\r\n\r\nsmall-time  businessmen are most welcome.   The  service  and\r\n\r\nconservancy  charges, utility rates and  rental  rebates  are\r\n\r\ngood  gestures  to the HDB heartlanders for the  difficulties\r\n\r\nthey had to face during the last economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one of the brilliant pieces is the company stock\r\n\r\noptions  scheme, which rules that there must be a requirement\r\n\r\nof  at  least 50% of the staff.  This requirement of at least\r\n\r\n50%   of  the  staff  would  ensure  that  there  is  a  fair\r\n\r\ndistribution of gains.  With many staff, at least  more  than\r\n\r\n50%  owning  a  stake in the company, they can only  work  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the shareholder value in the longer term, and  this\r\n\r\nis definitely good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we also need to look at other things. I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  why  we need to reduce corporate tax  by  1%.   The\r\n\r\nargument about tax, whether Singapore would be declared a tax\r\n\r\nhaven, was raised, and also whether the Government is locking\r\n\r\nitself  in to a lower tax rate.  In the past, there  was  the\r\n\r\nidea  of  giving  rebates and, just in the case  of  personal\r\n\r\nincome  tax, could rebates have been a more useful tool?   As\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists,  as workers, we believe  that  it  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant to make companies profitable, and we actually  took\r\n\r\na  lot  of cuts in the past to ensure that companies remained\r\n\r\nprofitable.   But  we  also believe that when  companies  are\r\n\r\nmaking money,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen  they are highly profitable, they should not be  unhappy\r\n\r\nto  pay  taxes.  Paying taxes is actually paying a return  to\r\n\r\nsociety for giving them the environment to make profits.  And\r\n\r\ntaxes are also useful because part of these could be used  to\r\n\r\nhelp the less-advantaged people in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of concern to the ground is the question\r\n\r\nof  GST.  They say that since personal income tax is reduced,\r\n\r\ncorporate tax is reduced, can they have an assurance that GST\r\n\r\nwould  either  stay  the same or, if our surpluses  are  good\r\n\r\nenough, it can drop a little and it would be most welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I would like to raise is this: the\r\n\r\nBudget could do a little bit more for the old and sick.   The\r\n\r\npension  revisions were far too little - $10 more.  We  could\r\n\r\ndo  more for pensioners and we could do more at more frequent\r\n\r\nintervals.  I think that we should also revisit our  thinking\r\n\r\nalthough  we  have endowment funds for the aged, for  medical\r\n\r\ncare,  that  we should revisit ourselves to see how  best  we\r\n\r\ncould help the old in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I would just like to reply to one\r\n\r\nhon.   Member,   who,   in  talking  about  Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies,  linked NTUC Fairprice in the list of  Government-linked  companies.   As  a  trade  unionist,  I  think   NTUC\r\n\r\nFairprice is definitely not a Government-linked company.   It\r\n\r\nis  owned by more than 200,000 individual trade union members\r\n\r\nwho  own  very  small shares - $20, $50 or  $1,000  -  and  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  trade  unions.  So it is not a  Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompany.   It is just a workers' cooperative that is well-run\r\n\r\nand  well  done.   And, if workers can run enterprises  well,\r\n\r\nthey  should be applauded and given incentives to do a better\r\n\r\njob, and not be described as a Government-linked company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would just like to describe this Budget as\r\n\r\ngenerous.   But if only CPF had been fully restored,  then  I\r\n\r\nwould be much happier.  I think workers would be much happier\r\n\r\nand we would have described this Budget as very generous.  So\r\n\r\nwe look forward to a very generous Budget in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, this year's Budget\r\n\r\nis  indeed a generous one, with something for everyone.  This\r\n\r\ntime,  the Minister has given special attention in developing\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge economy.  It was indeed good to note that, for\r\n\r\nthe  first  time in a very long time, something  special  has\r\n\r\nbeen done for the small and medium enterprises and start-ups.\r\n\r\nThis  will  go  a  long  way  in helping  us  to  grow  local\r\n\r\nenterprises.   I  personally call this  a  Knowledge  Economy\r\n\r\nTransition budget for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the tax concessions for start-ups and SMEs\r\n\r\nas well as for the self-employed and entrepreneurs;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the tax incentives for software and\r\n\r\nintellectual property operation and maintenance;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a learning fund for everyone who wants to\r\n\r\nupgrade himself or herself;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, stock options tax reliefs for big and small\r\n\r\ncompanies; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, higher rebates for everyone to soften the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  a  recession or a digital divide  should  we  see\r\n\r\nproblems during this transition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to address a few key issues, which I\r\n\r\nbelieve  were not adequately covered by the budget  proposals\r\n\r\nbut are important enough to get some attention if we want  to\r\n\r\ntransform  Singapore's  economy to  be  a  truly  first-world\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the state of the economy. In my speech\r\n\r\nduring  the Budget debate in 1999, I spoke about the accuracy\r\n\r\nof  the indices the Ministry uses to measure and predict  the\r\n\r\nstate of the economy and, hence, how policies are set for the\r\n\r\nbudget.   As I recall, in 1998, many private sector  industry\r\n\r\nleaders  projected  declines  in  certain  sectors   of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore economy, while the ministry projected growth in the\r\n\r\nsame  sectors.   A  year later, the results showed  that  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector's  reading of the state of  the  economy  was\r\n\r\nright while the Government's projections were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwrong.   This  shows  obvious gaps between  how  the  private\r\n\r\nsector reads the economy versus how the Government reads  it.\r\n\r\nThis  time  around, I am afraid, we may be  seeing  the  same\r\n\r\npattern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my take on the state of the economy and how many\r\n\r\nothers are seeing it:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the middle of December last year, there was a\r\n\r\nsudden  drop in demand, as if someone pulled the plug on  the\r\n\r\ngrowing  economy.   Comments like \"someone switched  off  the\r\n\r\nlights  in  December\" or \"things fell off the  cliff  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond  week of December\" were quite common.  In my  opinion,\r\n\r\nthis is happening because of the expectation, of course, of a\r\n\r\nweaker US economy this year and the loss of confidence  in  a\r\n\r\nsustained growth in the key sectors of our economy.  While  I\r\n\r\nheard  that  Dr  Ker talked about growth in  electronics  and\r\n\r\ntelecommunications, unfortunately, I think what we are seeing\r\n\r\nis that sectors like electronics, semi-conductors, mobile and\r\n\r\nwireless  communications equipment - and some of  these  that\r\n\r\nwere  high  growth  areas  -  are actually  starting  to  see\r\n\r\ndeclines  right  now.  While we started hearing  of  negative\r\n\r\nannouncements by companies in terms of drops in revenues  and\r\n\r\nprofits  and lowering of forecasted growth rates  since  July\r\n\r\nlast  year, the general expectation at that time was that  it\r\n\r\nwas a period of correction and that these were mainly company-specific problems and not a general industry problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have seen three quarters of such negative news,\r\n\r\nwith  companies  that did very well last year  also  sounding\r\n\r\ncautious  about  the economic growth and outlook.   This  now\r\n\r\ntranslates  to  a belief that we will be seeing  a  sustained\r\n\r\ndownturn  resulting  in  not-so-soft  a  landing  of  the  US\r\n\r\neconomy.   Coupled with the woes in Japan, confidence  levels\r\n\r\nhave dropped in many parts of the world, including Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  my  opinion, we will, without doubt, see a  slowdown  for\r\n\r\nnow,  and  it  may  last for the next two to three  quarters.\r\n\r\nWhat  is not so obvious is whether we will see recovery after\r\n\r\nthat.  And there are two possible scenarios that I would like\r\n\r\nto share.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first scenario is that the downturn is a short one\r\n\r\nand  the  US  economy goes for a soft landing and  confidence\r\n\r\ncomes  back, with consumers going back to purchase more.   In\r\n\r\nmy  opinion, there has been too much of pessimism  and,  like\r\n\r\nalways, consumers and companies have over-reacted due to  the\r\n\r\nloss  of confidence.  This over-reaction is causing companies\r\n\r\nto  drastically lower their forecasts of demand, to the point\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  now  over conservative.   These  days,  most\r\n\r\ncompanies  do  not  keep  very large volumes  of  inventories\r\n\r\nanyway,  and  they  will see a depletion of inventory  levels\r\n\r\nwhich have been built up in the last two quarters due to  the\r\n\r\nsudden drop of demand, while production levels remained  high\r\n\r\nat that time.  With the depletion of inventories, we will see\r\n\r\na  quick  turn-on of production when consumer demand returns.\r\n\r\nIf  and  when this happens, we will see growth going back  to\r\n\r\nsustainable levels and we can see a quick recovery.  There is\r\n\r\nalso  the Asia demand factor, especially the demand for goods\r\n\r\nand  services in China and Japan, especially if Japan reforms\r\n\r\neffectively.  And this Asian demand may, to a certain extent,\r\n\r\nmake up for the loss of US demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second scenario is not so nice. We may see a\r\n\r\ndownturn  lasting two to three years, and this will occur  if\r\n\r\nthe  US goes into a recession and if they fail to get out  of\r\n\r\nit fast and, especially, if the Japanese economy continues to\r\n\r\ndrag.  Consumer confidence would continue to be dragged  down\r\n\r\nfurther  and,  if the stock markets remain depressed,  people\r\n\r\nwould become more conservative in spending.  This will result\r\n\r\nin  a continued decline of companies' performances.  This, in\r\n\r\nmy   opinion,  would  lead  to  spiral  effects  of  loss  of\r\n\r\nconfidence,  where expectations of slowing sales and  profits\r\n\r\nin  companies  would lead to worries about  job  cuts,  which\r\n\r\nwould  lead  to  consumers slowing down spending,  and  which\r\n\r\nwould  further  erode profits, which would  in  turn  further\r\n\r\nweaken  consumer  confidence.  Up to the end  of  last  year,\r\n\r\ncorporations  were  holding  back making  drastic  structural\r\n\r\nchanges  to  their companies, including people  actions,  and\r\n\r\nthis was because the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpectation was that there was a quick turnaround around  the\r\n\r\ncorner,  and they wanted to be ready for a quick upturn  when\r\n\r\nit   comes  and,  therefore,  they  did  not  do  the   major\r\n\r\nrestructuring.   Given  that the  turnaround  did  not  come,\r\n\r\ncompanies  would  now  be  seriously  considering  structural\r\n\r\nchanges  in  their  organisations and this scenario  means  a\r\n\r\nrecession and tough times ahead for all of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to which of the two scenarios will prevail, I would\r\n\r\nsay  that  we need a little more time to analyse and predict.\r\n\r\nWe  have to at least see how the first quarter goes.   It  is\r\n\r\nonly  after  the  dust has settled and the current  confusion\r\n\r\nclears  up  due  to the \"over-pessimism\" that  we  have  seen\r\n\r\nstarting December can we tell which direction the economy  is\r\n\r\nheading.   While I personally subscribe to the first scenario\r\n\r\nof  a  quick turnaround, we really need about three  to  four\r\n\r\nmonths to be a little surer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel that the forecast of 5% to 7% is too\r\n\r\noptimistic,  given  the  many  changes  that  have  happened,\r\n\r\nstarting  from the middle of December last year.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthe  indicators that the Government uses to measure the state\r\n\r\nof  the  economy are not sensitive enough to gauge  the  true\r\n\r\nsituation  of the economy, as the private sector has  already\r\n\r\nreacted   to   the  sudden  slowdown  while  the   Government\r\n\r\nindicators are not ringing any alarm bells.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is that, in the past two years, economic\r\n\r\nrecovery  has  been  unequal,  post  Asian  crisis.   Certain\r\n\r\nsectors still lag behind and have not seen any recovery while\r\n\r\na  few did recover strongly, eg, the semi-conductors and  the\r\n\r\nelectronics  industry.  This time round, if a downturn  comes\r\n\r\nquickly, we may risk wiping out some of these companies which\r\n\r\nwill  be  hit  by a double whammy because they would  be  hit\r\n\r\nagain before they had a chance to recover from the last fall.\r\n\r\nMore,  therefore, should have been done in  this  budget,  in\r\n\r\nanticipation  of  a  deteriorating  economy.   We  should  be\r\n\r\nproactive and not reactive as we have been in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing I would like to talk about is the cost\r\n\r\nof  business  and the future of the manufacturing  sector  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   While  this  year's  budget  was  positive   for\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in  two areas, first, the lowering  of  corporate\r\n\r\ntaxes by 1% and, second, the lowering of property tax, I feel\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister could have taken the opportunity to review\r\n\r\nand  implement changes which could further make Singapore  an\r\n\r\nattractive   hub   and   a   centre  for   high   value-added\r\n\r\nmanufacturing activities.  My concerns are in a few areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the cost increases. In the last one year or\r\n\r\nso,  the  cost of doing business in Singapore has  increased.\r\n\r\nCosts have gone up in a number of areas, including Government\r\n\r\nrates,  utilities,  JTC rentals as well as  CPF  rates.   The\r\n\r\nreversal  of the cost-cutting measures occurred too  fast  at\r\n\r\nthe   first  sign  of  economic  recovery  last  year.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment should hold off any more increases, in my  opinion\r\n\r\nfor now, and should a downturn come fast, the Government must\r\n\r\nbe   ready  to  react  equally  fast  to  address  the   cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  issues.   The  cost  of  doing  business  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will soon become a big issue again if we  are  not\r\n\r\nvigilant  and  let  costs  go back to  the  pre-Asian  crisis\r\n\r\nlevels.  The Government should have a longer-term view of how\r\n\r\nthe  economy  should be managed, especially when it  involves\r\n\r\nthe cost of doing business in Singapore.  We got into trouble\r\n\r\nbefore  and  we  can  get into trouble  again.   I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  convene  a committee to start  planning  for  a\r\n\r\npossible downturn and identify proactive measures.  This will\r\n\r\nallow us to react decisively, should a downturn hit us again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing on the manufacturing sector is that we\r\n\r\nall  realise  the  importance of  further  strengthening  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector as well as to establish a stronger  base\r\n\r\nof  SMEs which can transform into world-class companies.   We\r\n\r\nhave  done an excellent job in attracting new investments  in\r\n\r\ntechnology   and  manufacturing  companies.   The   type   of\r\n\r\nincentives,  like the pioneer status, investment  allowances,\r\n\r\ngrants and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubsidies,  worked  well  in the  past.   Moving  forward,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve we need to devise new strategies and, therefore,  new\r\n\r\nsets   of   incentives  that  will  further  strengthen   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector as a key sector of our economy.\r\n\r\nSome  of  the things that we can do include giving incentives\r\n\r\nor   tax   breaks  for  companies  which  make   productivity\r\n\r\nimprovements.   If  a certain productivity  standard  can  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped and the Government can issue special tax incentives\r\n\r\nfor  companies  that  put  in the resources  to  become  more\r\n\r\nproductive, this will be good for all of us. With a perpetual\r\n\r\nshortage  of manpower, we have no choice but to be among  the\r\n\r\nmost  productive in any activities that we carry  out  if  we\r\n\r\ncompare ourselves to any other countries in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our incentive schemes also require investments\r\n\r\nto  be  made  physically  in  Singapore.   In  doing  so,  we\r\n\r\nencourage  companies to continue to add assets and  resources\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  even though it may make sense  to  place  such\r\n\r\nassets in more suitable countries.  I therefore suggest  that\r\n\r\nincentives to encourage outsourcing of activities to  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore  so  that companies will restructure and  focus  on\r\n\r\nkeeping only high value-added activities in Singapore.  In  a\r\n\r\nglobalised  knowledge economy, we should break up  the  whole\r\n\r\nvalue  and  supply  chain of activities of manufacturing  and\r\n\r\nservice  businesses  and place the components  of  the  value\r\n\r\nchain  in countries best suited to carry out these activities\r\n\r\nproductively and efficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation is also an urgent issue especially since\r\n\r\nregionalisation is not viable when the region is in  turmoil.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  should  therefore take  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  new  measures to give globalisation  a  boost,  to\r\n\r\nencourage  companies to move out of Singapore and beyond  the\r\n\r\nregion.    It  is  about  time  we  created  more  home-grown\r\n\r\nmultinational companies which can compete effectively outside\r\n\r\nour  shores and which can take advantage of the opportunities\r\n\r\nimmediately  available today as the whole  market  makes  its\r\n\r\ntransition to the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, while we have done well with Government\r\n\r\nassistance  and  incentive schemes, I feel that  we  need  to\r\n\r\nrestructure  the  schemes to be more market-driven  and  move\r\n\r\naway  from  incentives  that create a subsidy  mentality.   A\r\n\r\nsubsidy driven scheme just hides weaknesses and does not give\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  for  us  to  develop  fundamentally  strong\r\n\r\ncompanies able to compete in the world arena.  It is time  we\r\n\r\nreviewed  and  restructured  the  60-plus  incentive  schemes\r\n\r\nexisting today and to create a few effective ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third area which I would like to talk about is\r\n\r\nthe  promotion of entrepreneurship in the knowledge  economy.\r\n\r\nThe  last  two years had been excellent for us in encouraging\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to become more entrepreneurial.  Many  companies\r\n\r\nwere  set up and many of our young took the plunge to  become\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.  The technopreneurial excitement was, however,\r\n\r\nshort-lived for Singapore, but this, in my opinion,  was  for\r\n\r\nthe better because a long drawn period of boom based on hypes\r\n\r\nand fundamentally weak business strategies could have damaged\r\n\r\nour  economy  more and would have damaged the  confidence  of\r\n\r\nwould-be entrepreneurs even more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dot.com bust, there has been a big loss of\r\n\r\nconfidence among entrepreneurs and investors.  There are many\r\n\r\nlessons  to be learnt from the last two years of experiences.\r\n\r\nFor  example, our budding entrepreneurs have learnt about the\r\n\r\nneed  for  proper business models, the need  to  think  of  a\r\n\r\nglobal  market place and not Singapore as a market, the  need\r\n\r\nto  avoid \"me too\" ventures where we just follow what someone\r\n\r\nelse is doing without understanding the true strategies,  and\r\n\r\nthe  need  for fundamental business strategies to  be  worked\r\n\r\nout.   From my personal experience, we had many fundamentally\r\n\r\nweak  companies that sprouted out in the last two  years  and\r\n\r\nmany  could not have lasted anyway, even if the dot.com  bust\r\n\r\ndid  not  come.   The  bust  did come  and  many  experienced\r\n\r\nfailures.  I hope that this failure will become the basis  of\r\n\r\na better chance of success in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now over-pessimism among investors and VCs.\r\n\r\nMany  are not willing to fund even viable companies.   Unless\r\n\r\nsomething is done fast to help such companies, we will see  a\r\n\r\nsad   situation  of  potentially  good  companies  seeing   a\r\n\r\npremature   end.    At   the   end   of   last   year,    the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneurship 21 Private Sector Committee, of which I  am\r\n\r\na  member,  requested the Government to set aside  a  special\r\n\r\nfund  which  we  called a \"Lifeline Fund\" to help  struggling\r\n\r\nstart-ups  that still have fundamentals but are  facing  cash\r\n\r\nsqueeze  that  hinders their progress.  Many  face  immediate\r\n\r\ncollapse  if  not  helped  soon.  I will  elaborate  on  this\r\n\r\n\"Lifeline  Fund\" during the Committee of Supply  discussions.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, really urgent and we must do something before\r\n\r\nwe  destroy  the  good environment that we  have  created  in\r\n\r\npromoting technopreneurship in the last two years.   We  need\r\n\r\nto help some companies that are in trouble right now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final point I would like to touch on is the\r\n\r\nprivatisation of Government-linked companies and  this  is  a\r\n\r\ntopic that many Members have spoken about.  The reason  I  am\r\n\r\nbringing  this  up  again is to suggest that  while  we  have\r\n\r\nseemingly good GLCs, if we consider how they perform  in  the\r\n\r\nlocal  market,  the  truth of the matter  is  that  they  may\r\n\r\ndevelop weak fundamentals which would become serious setbacks\r\n\r\nwhen  such  companies compete with global  companies  outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We have seen many examples of how some  of  these\r\n\r\nGLCs  have failed to compete externally.  If we look  at  the\r\n\r\nmany GLCs in Singapore, the ones that are doing well are  the\r\n\r\nones  that are truly privatised and hence subjected  to  true\r\n\r\nmarket  discipline  like  any  private  sector  company.    I\r\n\r\ntherefore hope that the pace of privatisation will be speeded\r\n\r\nup.   While it will take time for privatisation to take place\r\n\r\nfor  all  GLCs, in the meantime, there should also be greater\r\n\r\ntransparency   of  how  GLCs  are  managed.    Policies   and\r\n\r\nincentives  for such companies should be market-driven.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment should avoid giving undue subsidies which  I  feel\r\n\r\nmay  just hide weaknesses of such companies.  We end up doing\r\n\r\na disservice to the GLCs because in the long term,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey  would  face problems when competing in the real  world,\r\n\r\nwhere there is true market competition when in fact the  GLCs\r\n\r\nhave been used to an \"easier than market\" governance approach\r\n\r\nthat we have created for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end by once again expressing that we are\r\n\r\nheading in the right direction of transforming Singapore to a\r\n\r\nknowledge economy.  The Budget announced by the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance supports the transition to the new economy.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister will seriously consider the suggestions I  have\r\n\r\nmade earlier to further strengthen Singapore's position as we\r\n\r\ncompete with the world's best economies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  his  speech, the Finance Minister  said  that  this\r\n\r\nBudget  is  the  \"best  ever\" and  \"most  generous\".   I  was\r\n\r\nsomewhat  surprised because, by right, during  the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears,  when the region was facing the financial crisis,  and\r\n\r\nthe  people  were desperately waiting for the  Government  to\r\n\r\ndish out more, the Government should be more generous in  its\r\n\r\nBudget,  yet it chose not to be so.  In the past,  even  when\r\n\r\nthe Government had a lot of budget surplus, it did not appear\r\n\r\nto  be so generous.  Why is it that the Government decides to\r\n\r\nbe so generous this year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us look at just how generous this Budget is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the reduction of personal income tax rates,\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister said that \"an individual with an annual\r\n\r\nincome of $35,000 would pay approximately 30% less tax and an\r\n\r\nindividual  whose  annual  income  is  $100,000  would   save\r\n\r\napproximately  20% in income tax.\"  As such,  the  lower  and\r\n\r\nmiddle income taxpayers will benefit most.  However, from  my\r\n\r\nown  calculations, under the new tax structure, an individual\r\n\r\nwith a $35,000 annual income would save only $230,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhile  one who earns $100,000 would save $2,230.  How can  we\r\n\r\nsay that people in  the lower-income group will benefit most?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the tax exemption on the first $7,500\r\n\r\nchargeable income and the 10% tax rebate that came  with  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of GST would benefit the higher income  people\r\n\r\nmost.   To  the  lower-income  group,  the  rebate  and   tax\r\n\r\nreduction  mean  nothing to them because if their  income  is\r\n\r\nlow, they pay no tax at all.  This is the true colour of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  generosity.  You must first  be  able  to  earn\r\n\r\nmoney  and the Government reduces its taxes on your  earnings\r\n\r\nand  it is then deemed to be mercifully generous to you.  But\r\n\r\nplease  do not forget that even the lower-income people  have\r\n\r\nto pay GST!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget also introduces a so-called \"benefit-sharing\" package, and the most attractive part is the CPF top-up scheme. However, under this scheme, in order to be\r\n\r\nentitled to the Government's top-up, there must first be some\r\n\r\nmoney  deposited into the CPF account.  It is like  what  the\r\n\r\nHokkien  people say, \"Money fears loneliness\".  Only  if  you\r\n\r\nhave  money  can you earn money.   Then, you  can  earn  some\r\n\r\nmoney from the Government and have more money. The Government\r\n\r\nis  happy  to  spend some money and show generosity,  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of the people, with the hope of achieving  what  was\r\n\r\ndescribed by an associate professor of NTU that \"The ordinary\r\n\r\npeople  are overwhelmed by an unexpected favour to the extent\r\n\r\nof  wanting to be thankful and be whole-heartedly grateful to\r\n\r\nthe great leaders.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the people of Singapore will face three major\r\n\r\nproblems  in the next few years: first, a weaker US  economy;\r\n\r\nsecondly, with the economic reform, the older people with low\r\n\r\neducational level will not be able to cope and may lose their\r\n\r\njobs  or  suffer  a  reduction in income; and,  thirdly,  the\r\n\r\nrising cost of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister said that the Government would help\r\n\r\nthose people who were affected by the economic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreform  to pull through.  Yet, in this Budget, I do  not  see\r\n\r\nhow the Government is going to help these lower-income people\r\n\r\nto pull through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most worrying part is that if the regional situation\r\n\r\nworsens,  and  if  the  US economy heads for a  hard-landing,\r\n\r\nmany  companies  will close down or retrench  their  workers.\r\n\r\nThe  people  in  the lower and middle-income  group  will  be\r\n\r\naffected most severely. Then, how are they going to survive?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the cost of living, in last year's Budget,\r\n\r\nthe  water-borne fees were raised substantially.  Electricity\r\n\r\ncharges were also increased considerably.  If the charges for\r\n\r\nthe  various basic services continue to be adjusted  upwards,\r\n\r\nthen  the  burden  of  the  people will  become  heavier  and\r\n\r\nheavier.  Although this Budget provides for a Utilities  Save\r\n\r\nscheme whereby rebates are given (and rebates can please  the\r\n\r\npeople and show that the Government is able and generous), it\r\n\r\nis  not  a long-term solution. The rebates can be reduced  or\r\n\r\neven revoked at any time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that what the Government should do is to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  cost of living will not keep on going up,  and  to\r\n\r\nalleviate  the  burden of the people through  some  budgetary\r\n\r\nmeasures.   The various rebates can only temporarily  relieve\r\n\r\nthe  pressure in the daily lives of the people.  It is unable\r\n\r\nto  resolve the problem of the escalating cost of living  and\r\n\r\nthe heavier and heavier burden of the ordinary citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, I am disappointed with this\r\n\r\nBudget which appears to be spectacular and extremely generous\r\n\r\nsuperficially, but which in substance fails to alleviate  the\r\n\r\nburden on the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I wish to speak\r\n\r\nin support of this motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have to describe the characteristic and impact of\r\n\r\nthis   Budget,  in  the  history  of  Budgets  presented   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, I would say this is the big one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.27 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it turned out a budget surplus of $3.54\r\n\r\nbillion, after providing for 50% of the Net Investment Income\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the reserve without entering  the  budget's\r\n\r\noperating revenue stream (this amount is $1.55 billion)  then\r\n\r\nproviding  for  $1.84  billion in special  transfers  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious  top-ups  to CPF, Lifelong Learning  Endowment  Fund,\r\n\r\nElderCare  Fund,  MediShield Scheme for the  Elderly,  Senior\r\n\r\nPensioners Grant Scheme, etc.  This out-turn of $3.54 billion\r\n\r\nis  arrived  at after transferring almost $2 billion  to  the\r\n\r\ntelcos  in  the  course of the year's decision to  accelerate\r\n\r\ntelecommunication sector liberalisation.  Even if we were  to\r\n\r\nadd  back  these  figures, the figure is  a  staggering  $8.9\r\n\r\nbillion.   Out of a total budget of $28 billion in 2000,  the\r\n\r\nsurplus   is   almost  one-third  of  the  total  expenditure\r\n\r\nbudgeted.  In the same breath, the economy turned in  a  9.9%\r\n\r\ngrowth.   The explanation for all these phenomena is  not  as\r\n\r\ndiscussed  just now, to be found in the year for the  general\r\n\r\nelection,  but  I  believe to be found in nowhere  except  in\r\n\r\nChinese mythology.  It is called the Year of the Dragon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is quick this year to give a $2 billion tax\r\n\r\ncut  across  almost  all  sectors  in  reduced  personal  and\r\n\r\ncorporate tax.  This is naturally welcome and needed.  It  is\r\n\r\nalso necessary, I think.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not against budget surplus, but excessive budget\r\n\r\nsurplus  out-turns at one-third of the projected  expenditure\r\n\r\nfor  the year can mean unnecessary deflationary pull  on  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector economy through taxes and statutory costs  and\r\n\r\nfees.   This  $2  billion  tax break  is  almost  universally\r\n\r\nwelcome by people from all walks of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A freer tax burden, including lower fees and statutory\r\n\r\ncosts,  can  lead to a more dynamic, entrepreneurial  economy\r\n\r\nwith lesser debt burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this high growth budget surplus result, many\r\n\r\npeople are asking:  where is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe growth coming from?  They do not feel the growth in their\r\n\r\nsector,  especially among the SMEs, the construction  sector,\r\n\r\nwhich  almost absorbs half of the capital formation  and  the\r\n\r\nfinancial services sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 100,000 new jobs were created last year and\r\n\r\nthe total external trade hit a record with exports growing by\r\n\r\n22% last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three areas in the economic data profile which\r\n\r\nI would like to express some concern for clarification by the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that overall productivity figures did not\r\n\r\nshow  comparable achievement, being at just over 5.2%,  which\r\n\r\nwas   lower   than   the  previous  year's  6.2%.    Sectoral\r\n\r\nproductivity in the financial services, business services and\r\n\r\nconstruction services sectors declined.  Overall and sectoral\r\n\r\nlabour  productivity  figures can vary  from  year  to  year,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  many data reasons, but the sectoral productivity\r\n\r\nfigures  give me cause for concern, as a large proportion  of\r\n\r\nthe economy is languishing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these sectors are undergoing re-engineering. So\r\n\r\nI  would  expect  some adjustment in their output  and  input\r\n\r\nfigures.   Others are already making significant  growth  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  especially  in manufacturing,  wholesale/retail\r\n\r\ntrade and transport and communications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our worst performing industrial sector continues to be\r\n\r\nconstruction  where we have almost 50% of our  gross  capital\r\n\r\nformation  -  more than $23 billion out of $46 billion.   The\r\n\r\nconstruction sector, which has contributed to about  6.8%  of\r\n\r\nour GDP at constant dollars, has been showing negative labour\r\n\r\nproductivity growth since 1995.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, both the financial services sector and the\r\n\r\nbusiness  services sector which contribute about $31  billion\r\n\r\nout of a constant dollar GDP of $140 billion, ie,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout  22%  of  the  economy, are also experiencing  negative\r\n\r\ngrowth in productivity.  Therefore, almost 30% of the economy\r\n\r\nis  languishing  in declining productivity  compared  to  the\r\n\r\nprevious   year.  This  is  something  of   note   while   we\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Minister for his Budget and economic growth.\r\n\r\nThese may perhaps explain the often time gasp, \"where is this\r\n\r\ngrowth coming from?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister not to let up on fiscal measures to\r\n\r\ngive  incentives  and penalties  for the errant  construction\r\n\r\nsector  to  buck  up  and  improve the construction  sector's\r\n\r\nproductivity.   Unfortunately, we put half  of  our  domestic\r\n\r\ncapital formation in this basket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lagging financial services and business services\r\n\r\nsectors  also  should be given some doses of  incentives  for\r\n\r\nresponsiveness,  as  they have also been in  negative  labour\r\n\r\nproductivity  growth in these few years.  They  somehow  have\r\n\r\nnot quite recovered from the financial crisis since 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the productivity figures, however, an\r\n\r\nimportant  feature  is that a significant number  of  100,000\r\n\r\njobs  were  created,  more than our annual  addition  to  the\r\n\r\nworking population by the natural cohort of 50,000.  It  also\r\n\r\nshows  that  there is considerable success in  re-channelling\r\n\r\nour workers who have been dislocated in one job to seek other\r\n\r\nemployment by training and retraining programmes.  I  believe\r\n\r\nwe  are  on  the right track with the Ministry of  Manpower's\r\n\r\nredoubtable  Manpower  21  programme  and  the  NTUC's  Skill\r\n\r\nRetraining effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area I wish to express concern is that\r\n\r\nsomehow  the  growth  of 9.9% in the economy  did  not  quite\r\n\r\nreflect  its lustrous performance in the monetary  aggregates\r\n\r\nof  M1 and M3, narrow money and broad money.  M1 only grew by\r\n\r\n7%, while broad money, M3, had been declining since 1998, and\r\n\r\nsince  August 2000, M2 has actually been shrinking.  This  is\r\n\r\nan  unusual  phenomenon,  as strong economic  growth  usually\r\n\r\ncorrelates with growth in the money supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hazard a guess that domestic money is seeking refuge\r\n\r\nin foreign money for better returns, either as deposits or as\r\n\r\nforeign  equity  or  assets.  Last year, in  the  balance  of\r\n\r\npayments figures, the Net Financial Account Deficit was $19.7\r\n\r\nbillion,  quite sizable, although reduced from  the  previous\r\n\r\nyear.   Since  1996, on the balance of payments  Capital  and\r\n\r\nFinancial  Account  Balance, there has  been  a  net  private\r\n\r\nsector  financial  outflow of funds on the capital  accounts.\r\n\r\nThese  figures and the general perception of \"where  is  this\r\n\r\ngrowth coming from?\", coupled with this deflationary pull  of\r\n\r\na  huge budget surplus, underline my concern on the state  of\r\n\r\nthe economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area concerns deregulation in this new era\r\n\r\neconomy,  especially  in  telecommunications,  utilities  and\r\n\r\nGovernment statutory boards.  Deregulation and liberalisation\r\n\r\nare  important  for  introducing  competition  and  customer-oriented development for efficiency.  But by themselves, they\r\n\r\nare  no  panacea.  Just like the hype about the  new  economy\r\n\r\nwhere  at one time, it was even touted that the more  chaotic\r\n\r\nand fuzzy the thinking, the better the prospect and potential\r\n\r\nfor    the   new   economy   valuation,   deregulation    and\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the New Zealand economy, for  example,  one\r\n\r\nof   the   world's   first  pioneer  in   government   sector\r\n\r\nliberalisation  and  deregulation, did  not  quite  make  for\r\n\r\nefficiency and customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, consumers there are not benefitting from the\r\n\r\nliberalisation programme.  While the Government would like to\r\n\r\nliberalise or deregulate certain sectors or privatise certain\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  it  must not do so on the sacred cow,  forsaking\r\n\r\nconvenience and customer service, and for the small  guy  and\r\n\r\nthe  people  at large.   The example of DBS and POSBank,  and\r\n\r\nSingapore Power come to mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, I hope we should remember that\r\n\r\ngood  old  economic value analysis still applies, whether  in\r\n\r\nthe  old or new economy.  Capital has its price, and business\r\n\r\nis about serving customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are transferring billions of dollars from the revenue\r\n\r\nstream onto all kinds of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFunds    -    Lifelong  Learning  Endowment  Fund,    Medical\r\n\r\nEndowment Fund, ElderCare Fund, etc.  I hope the Minister has\r\n\r\nsome mechanism to monitor whether these funds are put to good\r\n\r\nproductive use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tax offsets and rebates given this year will help\r\n\r\nmake  an  impact  on the overall population.  The  Government\r\n\r\npromised  last year that significant steps will be  taken  to\r\n\r\nuplift  our  people  by financial assistance,  by  access  to\r\n\r\neducation and learning funding for school-based or work-based\r\n\r\nlearning,  to  level  up society in the wake  of  the  income\r\n\r\ninequality  from globalisation challenges.   I  think  it  is\r\n\r\ndelivering all this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tax cut on property from 12% to 10% is quite across\r\n\r\nthe  board,  impacting many Singaporeans.  The  reduction  in\r\n\r\nindividual income tax by 2-5 percentage points for all  bands\r\n\r\nwill  significantly impact Singaporeans  from  all  walks  of\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generous service and conservancy charges and rental\r\n\r\nrebates granted for HDB dwellers are welcome goodies from the\r\n\r\nMinister.   Many  low  income  families  and  retirees   will\r\n\r\nappreciate this gesture from the Government towards  building\r\n\r\na caring society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Budget  this year has been generous,  yet  crafted\r\n\r\ncarefully to propel the economy forward.  It has measures  to\r\n\r\nhelp  Singapore stay competitive and has also eased the  pain\r\n\r\nof  restructuring.  While the Budget has focused on  the  big\r\n\r\npicture, I am glad that the Budget has also catered  for  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the individual Singaporeans.  Most importantly, I am\r\n\r\nconcerned  that  the unskilled or lowly skilled  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill have difficulty in finding a niche for themselves in the\r\n\r\nnew era economy.  Many of them are also sole breadwinners.  I\r\n\r\nam  glad that we have announced increased funding for several\r\n\r\nschemes, like investment in education and technology, CPF top-up, utility rebates, SC&CC rebates, ElderCare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFund and the Medical Endowment Fund.  These are some measures\r\n\r\nthat  have been put in place to help the lower income, but  I\r\n\r\nthink more needs to be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we push ahead to help propel the economy forward,\r\n\r\nthere will be stresses on the social fabric of society.   For\r\n\r\nthe unskilled or poorly skilled, structural unemployment will\r\n\r\nbe a major social stress on the family, and many of them find\r\n\r\nthat  even though there are opportunities for training,  they\r\n\r\nmay not have the ability to adapt to the new environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the skilled workers or even the professionals, they\r\n\r\nface  a  different type of stress.   The increasing trend  of\r\n\r\nfamilies  with  both  parents working long  hours  will  also\r\n\r\nstress  the  family unit.  It is important that  as  we  work\r\n\r\ntowards   increasing  productivity  and   restructuring   the\r\n\r\neconomy,  we  must  be  mindful of the family  unit  and  the\r\n\r\nstresses it faces.  Having more children see psychiatrist and\r\n\r\nincreasing  divorces  are signs of strain  on  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nfamily unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down on the ground, the Community Development Councils\r\n\r\n(CDCs)  can play a pivotal role in working with the voluntary\r\n\r\nwelfare  organisations to help prevent or relieve the  social\r\n\r\nstresses on the Singapore family.  It can be a central agency\r\n\r\nto   marshal   the   resources  of  the   voluntary   welfare\r\n\r\norganisations, and also be a key point for people  to  go  to\r\n\r\nwhen  they  need  help  in  this  area.   Current  CDCs  have\r\n\r\ninsufficient manpower and resources to carry out their  roles\r\n\r\nto  their full potential.  Government should increase funding\r\n\r\nfor  CDCs, and also look at increased incentives to encourage\r\n\r\nboth  individuals  and  companies to help  provide  increased\r\n\r\nfunding for the CDCs in their personal or company capacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other key organisation that is important in the\r\n\r\nheartlands  where  most  people live  in  will  be  the  town\r\n\r\ncouncils.  After the Asian economic crisis, the town councils\r\n\r\nand,  more lately, the CDCs have been looking for alternative\r\n\r\nfinancial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninstruments  to  place  their funds.  With  the  lowering  of\r\n\r\ninterest  rates,  bonds have become attractive  alternatives.\r\n\r\nIn line with the Government's effort to grow the bond market,\r\n\r\ntown  councils have also been active in participating in  the\r\n\r\nbond   market.    In  the  1998  Budget  statement,   a   10%\r\n\r\nconcessionary  rate  of tax on interest income  derived  from\r\n\r\nqualifying  debt  securities  was  announced.   However,  the\r\n\r\nconcessionary  tax rate for bonds has not  been  extended  to\r\n\r\ntown  councils  and  the CDCs.  Both these organisations  are\r\n\r\norganisations that work not for themselves but for the people\r\n\r\non  the ground and the people in the heartlands.  I think  it\r\n\r\nis  time  that  the Ministry of Finance considered  extending\r\n\r\nthis concessionary tax rate to these organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  wish  to congratulate the Minister for Finance for  giving\r\n\r\nout the best Budget during his tenure to date.  In many ways,\r\n\r\nDr  Richard  Hu's  long  years of prudence  in  steering  the\r\n\r\nfinancial and fiscal policies has enabled Singapore to remain\r\n\r\nthe beacon of a stable, progressive and prosperous economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the operating expenditure side, the Government has\r\n\r\nkept  itself  small, lean and effective.  In the  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure,  there  is  no  let-up  in  ensuring  that   our\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and  investment in  schools  and  educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  transportation,  housing,  hospitals,  medical\r\n\r\ncentres  and polyclinics keep up with the times and  of  high\r\n\r\nquality for the benefit of all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the revenue side, personal incomes and corporate\r\n\r\nearnings   have  grown  and  therefore  tax  revenues.    The\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  COEs,  GST and new  fees  and  charges  has\r\n\r\nenabled the Government to have good and regular income stream\r\n\r\nto   finance   the  expenditures  required.    What   is   of\r\n\r\nsignificance  is  Singapore's  ability  to  ride   over   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties of economic downturns and prepare  for  the  new\r\n\r\nwave of economic and business challenges in the horizon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic restructuring process, began in the mid-1980s, when Singapore met with its first economic recession\r\n\r\nsince  independence in 1985, taught us the  valuable  lesson.\r\n\r\nWe  learnt the lesson well and successfully overcame  quickly\r\n\r\nthe regional financial crisis 12 years later in 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new knowledge economy poses tremendous challenges\r\n\r\nfor  the Government and Singaporeans at large.  But,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nlike to make a plea for the elderly citizens in the light  of\r\n\r\nall  these challenges.  The longevity of our people,  because\r\n\r\nof  higher  standards of living and the increasing number  of\r\n\r\nelderly persons, are long-term issues we cannot avoid, but to\r\n\r\ndeal  with as early as possible.  For this growing  group  of\r\n\r\nelderly   citizens,   their   earnings   will   decline   and\r\n\r\nexpenditures  will  rise.   We are already  seeing  within  a\r\n\r\nfamily  two  generations of retired persons   -   parents  in\r\n\r\ntheir 80s and above, and children in their 60s who have  also\r\n\r\nretired.  This brings a heavy burden on these families  where\r\n\r\nmedical  cost and healthcare expenditures are major concerns.\r\n\r\nThey belong to the generation of little or no CPF savings and\r\n\r\nlower  earnings  in  their early active working  lives.   For\r\n\r\nmany of them, the homes they live in are the only assets they\r\n\r\nown.   They  have  little cash.  Yet the  policy  appears  to\r\n\r\ndisadvantage  them for assistance.  It is not  easy  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly  with financial needs to dispose of their homes  they\r\n\r\nare  comfortable  with or to downgrade to  smaller  flats  or\r\n\r\nselling   off   their   property   and   living   in   rented\r\n\r\naccommodation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask whether the Government can be a little bit\r\n\r\nmore  sympathetic  and considerate to these elderly  citizens\r\n\r\nwith financial difficulties to exclude from consideration the\r\n\r\nHDB  flat that they own, to be able to obtain financial  help\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Government  through the CDCs or  other  Government\r\n\r\nagencies.   The difficulties lie because their children,  who\r\n\r\nthemselves  are  not doing well, have their own  families  to\r\n\r\nsupport.  I know the children are encouraged and expected  to\r\n\r\nsupport  and  look after their parents, but for  those  whose\r\n\r\nparents  have  prolonged illness and need  long-term  medical\r\n\r\ncare,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  financial  strain  is burdensome  indeed.   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can modify its attitude to recognise that  we  are\r\n\r\nhaving  in our midst the pioneering generation of independent\r\n\r\nSingapore  needing help.  If we lighten the burden  of  these\r\n\r\nelderly  citizens  in their twilight years,  we  are  helping\r\n\r\ntheir children at the same time.  They would be relieved from\r\n\r\nthe financial burden of taking care of their grandparents and\r\n\r\nparents  and  concentrate on taking good care of their  young\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nCompetencies in Finance and Risk Management\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I observe the difficulties faced by individuals and\r\n\r\nsmall businesses, what strikes me most is the general lack of\r\n\r\ncompetency  or  even  literacy  in  the  management  of   the\r\n\r\nfinancial affairs and risks in our population.  I agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  principle  of  caveat emptor,  that  the  individual  is\r\n\r\nresponsible for the consequence of his investment  decisions,\r\n\r\nbut  do  we  have the positive attitude of sharing investment\r\n\r\nknowledge  and  experience amongst our people?   Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Ministry  can  take  upon  itself  to  educate   our\r\n\r\npopulation  in  the  area of financial and  risk  management.\r\n\r\nThese  are  areas  of  knowledge  and  skills  essential   to\r\n\r\nstrengthening   Singapore's  position  as  a  financial   and\r\n\r\nbusiness  hub  where  we have an investment-savvy  population\r\n\r\nplaying  an  active role in the businesses of the region  and\r\n\r\nthe  international markets.  We can all help one  another  to\r\n\r\nrealise  better  returns  and  values  for  investment,  both\r\n\r\nnational,  corporate and individuals.  This  is  one  way  of\r\n\r\nsecuring the best growth returns for the retirement nest  egg\r\n\r\nof  our people.  I say this, Sir, because in recent years  we\r\n\r\nhave  seen that those who have made investments through their\r\n\r\nCPF  savings  have not obtained the kind of value  that  they\r\n\r\nhave wished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, Singaporeans like the \"DIY\" (Do It\r\n\r\nYourself)  approach  and  are not prepared  to  pay  for  the\r\n\r\nservice  of  the  experts.  Sometimes I  do  not  blame  them\r\n\r\nbecause  the  so-called experts are not  truly  the  experts.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the move towards greater professionalism  in  the\r\n\r\nfinancial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservices  sector  is a welcome one.  The Singapore  consumers\r\n\r\ndeserve better service from businesses and service providers.\r\n\r\nIn  order to break away from the traditional ineffective ways\r\n\r\nof  rendering service, foreign talents are attracted to  play\r\n\r\nthe  useful  role of providing the much needed  expertise  in\r\n\r\nboth  the domestic and international markets.  Though I  must\r\n\r\nadd  that  the DBS Bank management did not display  the  high\r\n\r\nstandards  expected  of talented foreign  management  in  the\r\n\r\nhandling of the POSBank merger and subsequent consumer retail\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  POSBank, I believe we all can  learn  from  the\r\n\r\nlessons there.\r\n\r\nSupplementary Retirement Scheme\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supplementary Retirement Scheme allows foreigners to\r\n\r\nenjoy  additional  benefits that they  do  not  have  on  tax\r\n\r\ndeductible  allowance for CPF contributions.   Concerns  have\r\n\r\nbeen raised about the level of charges levied by SRS operator\r\n\r\nbanks  and the quality of financial advice they can offer  to\r\n\r\nSRS  participants.   I  agree with the Government's  move  to\r\n\r\nsupport  the local banks.  I hope these banks will do justice\r\n\r\nto  the  favourable position they enjoy in  the  deposit  and\r\n\r\ninvestment of SRS funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Government can take one step further through\r\n\r\nthe  SRS  to  give incentives to small and medium enterprises\r\n\r\n(SMEs)  to  encourage them to engage the services of  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  to  help  expand their markets.   Traditionally,  the\r\n\r\nexecutives  in  the MNCs have specialised and  expert  market\r\n\r\nknowledge  and networks round the globe.  The Singapore  SMEs\r\n\r\ncan  benefit  tremendously if they can be more successful  in\r\n\r\nachieving  good brand names for their products and  services.\r\n\r\nIn  the Internet world, having indigenous brands and managing\r\n\r\nthe integrity of our products and services will become highly\r\n\r\ncritical in the global markets.\r\n\r\nStock Option Scheme\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on stock option scheme. Under the Company\r\n\r\nStock Option\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nScheme,  the Government has provided some waiver of  tax  for\r\n\r\ngains  of up to $1 million over 10 years, and I believe  this\r\n\r\nis  a  good  move.  I support the sentiment that the  Company\r\n\r\nStock  Option  Scheme  should benefit  the  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nemployees  so that as stakeholders, the workforce  will  bond\r\n\r\nthe  staff  together  working as a  team  for  the  long-term\r\n\r\ninterest of the company and the people working in it.   I  am\r\n\r\nsurprised  that there are still some tax experts who  quibble\r\n\r\nas  to  why tax should be shifted from the point options  are\r\n\r\nexercised  to  the point when stock is sold, given  the  wild\r\n\r\nswings in the share prices.  Do these experts not know  that,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  the  employees  would  be  granted  share   options\r\n\r\nregularly,  and secondly, precisely because of the volatility\r\n\r\nof  share  price fluctuations the option holders should  only\r\n\r\nexercise  their options when they want to sell their  shares.\r\n\r\nIt  is really unwise for the option holders to exercise their\r\n\r\nshares  and continue to hold them as they would then have  to\r\n\r\nbear  the risk which many have learnt to their despair during\r\n\r\nthe  regional  financial crisis that it is  the  most  unwise\r\n\r\nthing  to  do.  I am glad that the Finance Minister does  not\r\n\r\nheed this suggestion of shifting tax from the point option is\r\n\r\nexercised  to the point when stock is sold, giving the  clear\r\n\r\nguidance  and  message  as to how option  holders  should  be\r\n\r\ncareful in exercising the options only when they want to sell\r\n\r\nthe shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, this year the Minister for Finance, Dr  Richard\r\n\r\nHu,  has presented a wealth-sharing Budget and this has  made\r\n\r\nSingaporeans think that this is a very generous Budget in  an\r\n\r\nelection year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With global economic competition getting more and more\r\n\r\nintense today,  many countries have plunged into economic and\r\n\r\npolitical  predicament.  In certain countries, owing  to  the\r\n\r\nquality of political leadership, these leaders are unable  to\r\n\r\nturn  around their economic decline, resulting in substantial\r\n\r\ncurrency\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndepreciation,  outflow  of  capital,  withdrawal  of  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments  and  grave unemployment situation.   The  people\r\n\r\nthere  have not been able to see the light at the end of  the\r\n\r\ntunnel  and  there are frequent riots.  The whole economy  is\r\n\r\nparalysed.   Under  these  circumstances,  even   a   general\r\n\r\nelection  followed  by a change of government  is  unable  to\r\n\r\nsolve their national problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, take a look at Singapore. We are\r\n\r\nable  to  accumulate budget surpluses year after  year.   The\r\n\r\npeople  are  well taken care of. They are well fed  and  well\r\n\r\nclothed.   People enjoy high wages and stable jobs. Even  the\r\n\r\nlow  income group and the less fortunate people receive  very\r\n\r\ngood  care  and  concern.  People are able to  share  in  the\r\n\r\nprosperity  of  the  country.  Our  society  is   stable  and\r\n\r\npeaceful, and our currency strong and stable.  People live in\r\n\r\nsafety  and  prosperity.  This is due, to a great extent,  to\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  the people of Singapore have  been  wise  in\r\n\r\nelecting  a  reliable  and  good  Government  which  has  the\r\n\r\npeople's welfare at heart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that some Singaporeans are of the view that the\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders  are overpaid in Singapore.   Fortunately,\r\n\r\nthe vast majority of Singaporeans are sober in realising that\r\n\r\nwe would rather have a good government which is paid well, of\r\n\r\nhigh  quality,  efficient, and works for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  than  to  have  a  \"cheapskate\"  government  to  lead\r\n\r\nSingapore into disasters and chaos.  As long as we  are  able\r\n\r\nto  maintain this national consciousness we will continue  to\r\n\r\nhave a peaceful and prosperous Singapore where the people are\r\n\r\nable  to share in the wealth of the nation, year after  year.\r\n\r\nThis  is our common wish.  The Opposition Member, Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang,  remarked that the Budget was only seemingly generous\r\n\r\nbut  not  so substantially.  I think such a remark  can  only\r\n\r\ncome  from those who may know a lot about politics but little\r\n\r\nabout economics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I visited the Silicon\r\n\r\nValley in the United States of America in July last year, the\r\n\r\nUS\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomy  was booming.  I was told that when a high-technology\r\n\r\ncompany  wanted to engage a head of department, it had  great\r\n\r\ndifficulty in getting a suitable candidate.  Very  often,  it\r\n\r\nhad  to  offer very attractive salaries and stock  option  to\r\n\r\npoach  from other high-technology companies for the  required\r\n\r\ntalent.   Even then, not many people were interested in  such\r\n\r\nattractive offers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a few months later, the situation over there\r\n\r\nunderwent  some  earth-shaking changes.   Two  weeks  ago,  I\r\n\r\nvisited  the Silicon Valley again. I could vividly feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  US  economy  has slowed down.  Those  dot.com  companies\r\n\r\nwhich  did not have solid foundations saw their share  prices\r\n\r\nfalling from US$100 to US$1, some even went down to 60 cents.\r\n\r\nEven  the  strong high-tech companies also found their  share\r\n\r\nprices  tumbling down from US$100 to between US$16 and US$26.\r\n\r\nThe consumption market was also very hard hit.  The same high-tech company, which I mentioned earlier, now receives some 60\r\n\r\nto  70  applications for one vacancy of head  of  department.\r\n\r\nAmong  the applicants, many are Ph.D and M.Sc degree holders.\r\n\r\nAs  such, I  feel that the slowing down of the US economy  or\r\n\r\nthe possible recession will    have great impact on the world\r\n\r\neconomy, including Singapore's economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one observation which warrants our attention.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  was  talking  to the entrepreneurs  in  the  Silicon\r\n\r\nValley, they did not think the conservative economic ideas of\r\n\r\nthe  new US administration would be able to solve the present\r\n\r\neconomic crisis faced by the United States of America.   That\r\n\r\nbeing  the case, we should pay more attention to the  changes\r\n\r\nin  the  US  economy, and monitor closely the  progress  over\r\n\r\nthere.   Perhaps,  we should consider putting   part  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic development plan on the two major economies in Asia,\r\n\r\nnamely,  flourishing China and the potentially viable  India.\r\n\r\nIn  my view, hitherto, our investments in these two countries\r\n\r\nand  our  understanding  of  their cultural  backgrounds  are\r\n\r\ngrossly inadequate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased with the tax reduction and rebates\r\n\r\nannounced  in  the  Budget.  These will benefit  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfrom all stations of life as well as the business community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction in corporate tax is the general trend in the\r\n\r\nwhole globalised economy.  The biggest piece of good news  to\r\n\r\nthe business community is the reduction of corporate tax from\r\n\r\n25.5% to 24.5%.  To maintain our  competitive edge,  it would\r\n\r\nbe absolutely necessary to carry on cutting our corporate tax\r\n\r\nin the next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the individual tax, with effect from YA 2002,\r\n\r\nthe  Government will reduce the rate of individual income tax\r\n\r\nby  2% to 5% and the top income bracket will be reduced  from\r\n\r\n28% to 26%.  This is a wise move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has continued to help the low income\r\n\r\ngroup  by ways of rebates and reduction in rental, utilities,\r\n\r\nand  S&C charges.  This means that when we have succeeded  in\r\n\r\nour  economic  development,  we do  not  neglect  those  less\r\n\r\nfortunate  and elderly people.  We also provide opportunities\r\n\r\nfor  them to be trained and retrained.  The Minister has also\r\n\r\nput  forward  many measures to stimulate our  commercial  and\r\n\r\nbusiness community.  These include the employee stock  option\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st April onwards, the gains made by this scheme\r\n\r\nwill  be tax exempt for the first $2,000.  Thereafter, a  tax\r\n\r\nof  25%  will be levied on the other gains with a cap  of  $1\r\n\r\nmillion.  This measure will stimulate the enterprises and the\r\n\r\nenterpreneurs.   I  feel that the Government  is  still  very\r\n\r\nconservative in this scheme.  I hope that the Government will\r\n\r\nbe   bolder   and   faster  to  approve  the   entrepreneur's\r\n\r\napplication for such a scheme so that their employees will be\r\n\r\nable to enjoy the gains under this scheme earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  in  support of the motion as proposed  by  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is indeed a good Budget filled with\r\n\r\ngoodies  for  everyone.  It is a Budget  aimed  at  nurturing\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and our businesses to transit into a  knowledge-based economy.  The Budget will provide a boost for Singapore\r\n\r\nto  position  itself in the new economy.  It will  also  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to prepare themselves for global competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small country with limited resources, Singapore has\r\n\r\nno  choice  but to continually carve out niches  to  position\r\n\r\nitself  in an increasing seamless global market.  Development\r\n\r\nof  human  capital  has  always been  our  main  focus.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  continues  to  invest heavily  in  educating  our\r\n\r\nyoung, and upgrading the skills of our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are constantly chasing global trends, we must\r\n\r\nnot forget those who may encounter difficulty to keep pace of\r\n\r\nthe  changes.  Every effort must be made to help these fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans feel at home in Singapore.  Otherwise, dichotomy\r\n\r\nwill  occur  in  our  population, thus weakening  our  social\r\n\r\nfabric.  Thus, the key challenge facing the Government is  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  globally competitive workforce, and at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  continue  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this year's Budget is a generous one, I am sure\r\n\r\nthe  Government can do more to help small consumers and small\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   This  is  particularly  so  for  many   working\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  had suffered CPF cuts over  the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears.  Small  and medium enterprises (SMEs) have  also  been\r\n\r\nbadly  affected  by  the financial crisis  and  globalisation\r\n\r\ntrends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to propose the following measures for\r\n\r\nnurturing  small consumers and SMEs to transit into  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On personal tax and GST rebate, the cut of income tax\r\n\r\nrates  and  one-off  income tax rebate  of  10%  have  indeed\r\n\r\nlowered  the tax burden of many workers.  A comparison  among\r\n\r\nlow,  middle  and  high-income earners shows that  low-income\r\n\r\nearners  (those earning $35,000 per annum) will enjoy  a  tax\r\n\r\nsaving of $175\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhile the middle income (those earning $50,000 per annum) and\r\n\r\nhigh-income  earners (those earning $100,000  annual  income)\r\n\r\nwill  have $375 and $1,775 tax savings respectively.  As  all\r\n\r\nincome  earners  suffer a flat rate of $250 GST  rebate  cut,\r\n\r\nthis  has drastically reduced the income tax saving  of  low-income earners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whether you are a low or high-income earner, you\r\n\r\nstill  pay the same price for a cup of coffee and a  bowl  of\r\n\r\nnoodles.   The  increasing  cost  of  living  has  put   much\r\n\r\nfinancial  burden on many small consumers.  It affects  their\r\n\r\nquality  of  life.  I hope the Finance Minister can  consider\r\n\r\nmore  innovative  ways to give out tax  rebates,  which  will\r\n\r\nbenefit low-income earners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example to follow is the National Wages Council\r\n\r\nwhich   recommends  a  fixed  and  variable  salary  increase\r\n\r\nmechanism to help low-income earners.  Income tax rebate  can\r\n\r\nalso  have  both a fixed sum rebate and a percentage  cut  to\r\n\r\nmotivate all our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for S&C and utilities rebates, we should extend the\r\n\r\nbenefits to HDB Executive flat residents and retirees  living\r\n\r\nin private estates.  Some Singaporeans in these groups do not\r\n\r\nenjoy  much benefit from income tax rebates or other  relief.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Woodlands New Town, we have quite a number of\r\n\r\nmulti-tier  families  staying in jumbo HDB  Executive  flats.\r\n\r\nThese residents have made efforts to stay together as one big\r\n\r\nfamily  so  as  to look after their parents.  But,  they  are\r\n\r\nalways being left with not much rebate when Government shares\r\n\r\nits surplus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Widow Fund, the competitive society and cost of\r\n\r\nliving  in  Singapore have made life very difficult  for  one\r\n\r\ngroup  of  Singaporeans, that is, widows.  Families that  are\r\n\r\nstruck  with  disaster, such as death, or  major  illness  of\r\n\r\ntheir  sole  bread-winners, usually encounter much difficulty\r\n\r\nto  raise their families thereafter.  Their quality  of  life\r\n\r\ndeteriorates  very quickly and their children's education  is\r\n\r\nbadly affected.  A widow with two or more children to support\r\n\r\nwill face grave\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifficulty  to balance between work and family.  There  is  a\r\n\r\ndrastic  lack  of communal support facilities and  affordable\r\n\r\nfamily service centers to help these families.  I would  urge\r\n\r\nthe Government to consider setting up a Widow Fund to provide\r\n\r\nspecial  assistance  to these disadvantaged  families.   This\r\n\r\nwill  provide  a  level playing field for their  children  to\r\n\r\nsucceed in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present assistance schemes provided by the CDCs and\r\n\r\nvarious  constituencies  are  inadequate  to  alleviate   the\r\n\r\nfinancial  burden faced by widows.  Very often, the financial\r\n\r\nassistance is short-term and does not alleviate the long-term\r\n\r\nfinancial  burden of widows.  I would urge the Government  to\r\n\r\nshow  more  compassion to widows, and help them to live  life\r\n\r\nmore  comfortably.  My sympathy and admiration  goes  to  all\r\n\r\nwidows  who  make untiring sacrifices for their  children  to\r\n\r\nsucceed in life.  Sir, they deserve special attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On subsidy for pre-school education, in the past, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  taken  a position that pre-school  education\r\n\r\nshould  be  left  to the private sector, and  thus  not  much\r\n\r\nsupport  was given to pre-school operators.  However,  recent\r\n\r\nfindings  have  shown  that  pre-school  education  plays   a\r\n\r\ncritical  role  in nurturing young minds to be well  equipped\r\n\r\nfor mainstream education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, children in mainstream education enjoy subsidized\r\n\r\neducation while those in pre-school centres pay market  rates\r\n\r\nranging  from $25 to about $800 per month.  This  has  placed\r\n\r\nmuch  financial burden on families with two or more children.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Government  were to encourage Singaporeans  to  have\r\n\r\nlarger  families,  we  must provide  this  basic  support  of\r\n\r\nsubsidizing pre-school education.  This is in line  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's focus on educating our young.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Eldercare and Medical Endowment Fund, the\r\n\r\ncontribution of $250 million to the Eldercare Fund  and  $100\r\n\r\nmillion  to the Medical Endowment Fund is a welcomed move  in\r\n\r\nview  of the fast ageing population.  The rising health  cost\r\n\r\nin Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  concern for many Singaporeans,  especially  the\r\n\r\nelderly  and low-income earners.  Besides supporting  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes  and  medical bills of the lower-income individuals,  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  funds  can also be used to provide free  community\r\n\r\nambulance  services  for the elderly and  primary  healthcare\r\n\r\nservices at the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year, the Ministry of Health implemented\r\n\r\na  pilot  Primary Care Partnership Scheme to contract private\r\n\r\nclinics to serve needy elderly in the community.  This scheme\r\n\r\ncan  be expanded to provide a wider range of medical services\r\n\r\nfor the elderly.  The eligibility criteria should be reviewed\r\n\r\nto  allow more elderly to qualify for the scheme.  The scheme\r\n\r\ncan  also  be extended to young children below the  schooling\r\n\r\nage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On nurturing small and medium businesses, local SMEs\r\n\r\nplay an important role in our economy.  They comprise 92%  of\r\n\r\nthe  total establishments in Singapore and employ 51% of  our\r\n\r\nworkforce.   In the knowledge-based economy, our  local  SMEs\r\n\r\nwill   continue  to  perform  a  vital  role   to   spearhead\r\n\r\nSingapore's  globalisation efforts. But, the Government  must\r\n\r\nbe proactive to help local SMEs perform this role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SME 21 plan is a step forward in building the\r\n\r\ncapabilities of our local SMEs.  But we need to identify  the\r\n\r\npotential  of  SMEs  in the products and  services  industry.\r\n\r\nMore  efforts must be channelled to help SMEs that have  good\r\n\r\npotential  to develop niches and position their products  and\r\n\r\nservices  in  the global marketplace.   More generous  grants\r\n\r\ncan be given to accelerate their globalisation efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from local SMEs indicates that many of them are\r\n\r\nfacing  problems of high rental and labour cost in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe cost of Government services and compliance cost have also\r\n\r\ncontributed  to the increased business costs.   In  order  to\r\n\r\nposition  local  SMEs in the new economy,  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\npropose the following measures:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Property Tax Cut\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut in property tax and the removal of the existing\r\n\r\n25%  property tax rebate in July 2001 will not help  much  in\r\n\r\nreducing  business  costs.   SMEs, especially  owner-occupied\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  expect a higher property tax cut to enable  them\r\n\r\nto ride out the crisis.  Since the implementation of GST, the\r\n\r\ntax  base of the Government has broadened.  It is about  time\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government seriously considered removing  property\r\n\r\ntax  in  Singapore, especially for owner-occupied properties.\r\n\r\nThis would not only encourage asset ownership but also reduce\r\n\r\nthe  cost of businesses that invest in property for long-term\r\n\r\ngrowth.   Our  taxation  policy  must  not  pose  unnecessary\r\n\r\nhindrances to the growth of our local SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Reduction of National Development Expenditure\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's budget has allocated a lower development\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  the Ministry of National Development.   The\r\n\r\n$500  million reduction in development expenditure will  have\r\n\r\nan  adverse  impact  on the construction industry,  which  is\r\n\r\npresently experiencing low workload.  The projected  slowdown\r\n\r\nof HDB building programme will further aggravate the state of\r\n\r\nthe construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many local construction firms are HDB contractors and,\r\n\r\nthus,  will not be able to secure enough contracts this  year\r\n\r\nto   keep  their  workforce.   The  decrease  in  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure  will further dampen the industry,  resulting  in\r\n\r\nmore  job  losses.  There will be more intense and  unhealthy\r\n\r\ncompetition   among  contractors,  leading   to   undesirable\r\n\r\nconsequences such as poor construction quality and safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Government is actively promoting sporting and\r\n\r\nhealthy lifestyle among Singaporeans, we should expedite  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  park  connectors and  upgrading  of  sports\r\n\r\ncomplexes.   Older design swimming pools should also  undergo\r\n\r\nmajor  upgrading to keep abreast of new lifestyle aspirations\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans.   Sports complexes  can  be  upgraded  with\r\n\r\nmodern equipment, like\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose   of   the  California  Fitness  Centre,   to   attract\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to keep fit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the construction industry is in need of assistance\r\n\r\nto  get  out  of  the  crisis.  Many construction  firms  are\r\n\r\nfinding  it  difficult to survive in the present environment.\r\n\r\nUnless  the Government steps in to assist, we may  lose  some\r\n\r\nconstruction firms, including some construction  pioneers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  will retard our efforts to  nurture  local\r\n\r\nSMEs to be world-class companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next few years will be testing years for\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  we  transit from the old to the  new  economy.\r\n\r\nBoth  our  business community and people will be affected  in\r\n\r\none  way  or another in the transition.  We must continue  to\r\n\r\nstrive  to work hard together to cope with these changes.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  our concerted efforts will definitely bear  fruition\r\n\r\nfor future generations of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to support good governance to safeguard\r\n\r\nour  future.   In a globalised environment, it is  even  more\r\n\r\ncrucial to have good governance to ensure that Singapore  can\r\n\r\nthrive in the global world successfully.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  join  others who have spoken already  in  expressing\r\n\r\nappreciation  of the Minister for Finance's generous  Budget,\r\n\r\nwith  something in it for everyone - companies big and small,\r\n\r\nand individuals across the board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the background of the Census Report 2000,\r\n\r\nreleased last month on household income, it is good  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  we have not forgotten to specifically direct some small\r\n\r\nmeasure  of assistance to those at the bottom of the economic\r\n\r\nladder  in the form of utilities and rental rebates,  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  structuring  of  CPF  top-ups,  such  that  lower-income\r\n\r\nearners receive the highest payouts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Census Report showed a widening of the income gap,\r\n\r\nwith those at the top 10% of households earning 36 times more\r\n\r\nthan those in the bottom 10%.  It has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncaused   a  significant  discussion,  as  indeed  it  should,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  the midst of concurrent recent soul-searching\r\n\r\nabout   what  it  means  to  be  Singaporean,  on  belonging,\r\n\r\nrootedness  and values.  The Prime Minister, just  quoted  in\r\n\r\nyesterday's  newspapers, said that  we  should  not  get  too\r\n\r\ncarried  away  in exaggerating both the width of  the  income\r\n\r\ndivide  or  its  consequences.  Certainly, at this  point  in\r\n\r\ntime, we are very far from being a society that is polarised,\r\n\r\nwith  a  group  of  very  rich who  indulge  in  ostentatious\r\n\r\nconsumption,  against  the  backdrop  of  large  numbers   of\r\n\r\ndesperately poor without even their most basic needs met.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our short history has been one that has seen\r\n\r\nlarge  numbers of Singaporeans, the majority, being  able  to\r\n\r\ntranslate  their efforts and capabilities into much  improved\r\n\r\nstandards  of  living  for  themselves.   Nor  is  there  any\r\n\r\nargument  with the Government's focus and policies to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  we keep abreast of the challenges of globalisation,  of\r\n\r\nits philosophy of leveraging upwards, giving its attention to\r\n\r\nhow  to  support and facilitate enterprise and talent at  the\r\n\r\ntop,  so  as  to generate benefits for the nation  at  large.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I do believe that we should pause  to  look  at\r\n\r\nthe  widening  income gap and review if we are  indeed  doing\r\n\r\nenough to ensure that we will continue to maintain our social\r\n\r\ncohesion and build an even stronger national spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing the income divide, there are two main\r\n\r\nissues  that  are  cause for concern.  The  two  issues  are,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  ensuring access to education and training that  are\r\n\r\ncritical to providing all Singaporeans the opportunity to  do\r\n\r\nbetter  for  themselves  and,  secondly,  providing  adequate\r\n\r\nassistance  and  support to those who are struggling  at  the\r\n\r\nbottom  of  the  income  ladder.  These  two  issues  are  of\r\n\r\nparticular  relevance to four groups of people:  the  elderly\r\n\r\npoor,  women, the large group of older and unskilled workers,\r\n\r\nand  the  present and future school children from  low-income\r\n\r\nhouseholds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an education system that produces sterling\r\n\r\nexamination results and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsees   our   children  winning  accolades  at   international\r\n\r\nmathematics and science competitions.  These are our kids  at\r\n\r\nthe top.  But does our system give enough support to the kids\r\n\r\nat  the bottom, particularly those whose home environment may\r\n\r\nafford  them  hardly the bare essentials?  That education  is\r\n\r\nthe   bridge   across  the  income  divide   is   clear   and\r\n\r\nunquestionable.   Another quick look  at  the  Census  Report\r\n\r\nshows  clearly  the  difference that just  one  member  of  a\r\n\r\nhousehold  having  a  higher level of educational  attainment\r\n\r\nmakes to those households' average income.  It is imperative,\r\n\r\ntherefore, that children of the lower income households  have\r\n\r\nnot  only the opportunity to be in school, but a little extra\r\n\r\nattention,  where necessary, to make up for what support  may\r\n\r\nbe  lacking in difficult home circumstances, so that they may\r\n\r\nhave  a  good  shot at better opportunities in  life  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, for the large pool of older unskilled\r\n\r\nworkers,  retraining  and  upgrading  of  their  skills   are\r\n\r\ncritical  and, in this area, the Government has been devoting\r\n\r\nsignificant  attention and resources.  However,  response  to\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading programmes could be much more satisfactory,\r\n\r\nand  work  must continue to be done to see how  this  can  be\r\n\r\nimproved.  Apart from those for whom the issue is simply that\r\n\r\nof  poor  attitude,  what  are the  obstacles  hindering  the\r\n\r\nparticipation of the others?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the elderly, we must look at both those who are\r\n\r\nalready  currently  in  their retirement  years  as  well  as\r\n\r\npreparing  for  the aging of our population of baby  boomers.\r\n\r\nThe  IMC  on the aging population in 1999 devoted one segment\r\n\r\nof   its  report  to  planning  for  financial  security   in\r\n\r\nretirement.  For those already 65 years and above, it is  too\r\n\r\nlate  to be talking about financial planning, and our efforts\r\n\r\nmust  be to see how we can help those who need assistance  to\r\n\r\naccess  it.  These are the citizens in our midst who  do  not\r\n\r\nknow what help is available, do not know how or are too frail\r\n\r\nor otherwise incapable of accessing available assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent information on the almost 200,000\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who missed the opportunity of  benefiting  from\r\n\r\nthe  first tranche of CPF top-up is an illustration of  this.\r\n\r\n23%  of them were over 65 years of age, probably without  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts  in  the first place, unaware of the scheme  or  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  to deposit $100 in the qualifying period,  or  too\r\n\r\npoor to spare the amount.  Our CPF top-up is the best way  to\r\n\r\nshare  some of the economic surpluses during good  years  for\r\n\r\nthe  country.   Would  the  working  majority  begrudge  some\r\n\r\nportion  of the goodies being shared with those who  have  no\r\n\r\nCPF  accounts, particularly if they are the older  generation\r\n\r\nwho contributed in the past, or women whose contributions are\r\n\r\nnot in the labour force?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, could we go beyond the current structuring of\r\n\r\npayouts  to further direct the money where it is most needed?\r\n\r\nFor  the people in the top 20%, could we implement an  opt-in\r\n\r\nscheme   to  indicate  that  they  want  their  $500  top-up,\r\n\r\notherwise that money would be re-directed for disbursement to\r\n\r\nthe  bottom  20%?  The amount could mean very little  to  one\r\n\r\ngroup and be significant to the other, and it would be a good\r\n\r\nway to demonstrate concern and support across the divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach of looking at various ways of enhancing\r\n\r\nSingaporeans'   financial  planning  for  their   retirement,\r\n\r\nthrough  their CPF savings, assumes that people  have  enough\r\n\r\nsavings   available  to  spare  in  the  first  place.    The\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Retirement Scheme, the details of  which  were\r\n\r\nalso recently announced, is such an example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is a large group of Singaporeans, the 47%\r\n\r\nof women who are not in the labour force, ie, the homemakers,\r\n\r\nand  who  therefore have no CPF accounts, who will presumably\r\n\r\nhave  to rely entirely on their children to provide for them,\r\n\r\nsince  they are most likely to survive their spouses.   These\r\n\r\nwomen  work; only their work is unpaid labour, done at  home.\r\n\r\nWould our economy be able to hum and grow as it has, if there\r\n\r\nwas not all that work being done every\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nday  in homes all through the island to keep our workers  fed\r\n\r\nand  rested,  and our children cared for?  These  women  will\r\n\r\nalso grow old and add to the households with retirees without\r\n\r\nincome  that form the bottom 10%.  We must find  a  means  to\r\n\r\nregister  and  reward their contribution so that,  when  they\r\n\r\ngrow old, they do not then find that, after the many years of\r\n\r\ncontribution, they are reduced to feeling that  they  survive\r\n\r\nonly on the generosity of society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is one other group that has an important\r\n\r\npart to play in any discussion on the income divide, and this\r\n\r\nis  the group at the top, who are of concern for two reasons.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  they  may be moved to give something  back  to  the\r\n\r\nsociety that has enabled their development and progress,  and\r\n\r\ncontribute their skills and abilities as well as some portion\r\n\r\nof  their  material wealth in helping the further advancement\r\n\r\nof  the  nation  and  the  welfare of its  less  well-endowed\r\n\r\ncitizens.

Currently 16% of GEP students, 52% of Express\r\n\r\nStream  students, and 72% of Normal Stream students  live  in\r\n\r\nHDB  4-room  or  smaller  flats. We  currently  do  not  have\r\n\r\ncomplete  data on the socio-economic profile of our  students\r\n\r\nin the tertiary institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data above shows that our education system, based on\r\n\r\nmeritocracy,   provides   a  range   of   opportunities   for\r\n\r\neducational advancement to all students  according  to  their\r\n\r\naptitudes  and abilities irrespective of their socio-economic\r\n\r\nbackground.   While  it  is possible  to  make  opportunities\r\n\r\navailable,   equalising  opportunities  will   not   equalise\r\n\r\noutcomes.   That  89% of students now obtain  post  secondary\r\n\r\neducation,  a  figure  that  compares  favourably  even  with\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries in the OECD, indicates that the education\r\n\r\nsystem  does  provide opportunities for the vast majority  of\r\n\r\nstudents  to secure good jobs in a modern economy  and  avoid\r\n\r\nimpoverishment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that all children in Singapore can benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  our education system, general education is almost fully\r\n\r\nsubsidised  by the Government.  Parents are only required  to\r\n\r\npay miscellaneous fees as a contribution towards the cost  of\r\n\r\nmaterials  used  by  pupils in the  schools,  and  subsidised\r\n\r\nschool fees in secondary schools and JC/CIs.  There is also a\r\n\r\nFinancial  Assistance Scheme which pupils  from  lower-income\r\n\r\nhouseholds can apply for.  School fees for pupils under  this\r\n\r\nscheme  are  waived.  The scheme also offers  exemption  from\r\n\r\npayment  of  miscellaneous fees, except for  a  portion  that\r\n\r\nparents  have  to co-pay.  Needy students under  this  scheme\r\n\r\nalso  receive free textbooks.  Needy pupils can also  receive\r\n\r\nadditional assistance and bursaries from schemes administered\r\n\r\nby  their  schools and community organisations  such  as  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Development Councils and Family Services Centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under the Edusave Pupils Fund, every 1st to\r\n\r\n3rd  born  child between the ages of 6-16 receives an  annual\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  his/her  Edusave  account.   In  2001,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  contributed  $160  to  the  Edusave  account   of\r\n\r\neligible  pupils.   Pupils  can use  the  money  to  pay  for\r\n\r\nenrichment  programmes  or  pay  for  a  portion   of   their\r\n\r\nmiscellaneous  fees.   As a special encouragement  to  pupils\r\n\r\nfrom  more  modest backgrounds, Edusave merit  bursaries  are\r\n\r\ngranted  to  those in the top 25% who were not  eligible  for\r\n\r\nEdusave scholarships.\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
