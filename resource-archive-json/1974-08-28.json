There is happily no  lack  of\r\n\r\ninitiative from both these sectors in the planning\r\n\r\nand  implementation of more adequate services  for\r\n\r\nthe  aged  and  the aged sick. Although  both  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and voluntary welfare organisations  do\r\n\r\nprovide  institutional care for the aged  and  the\r\n\r\naged  sick, this we recognise is, at best, only  a\r\n\r\npoor    substitute   for   family   care.   Recent\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in  the Republic have  been  in  the\r\n\r\ndirection of establishing facilities and  services\r\n\r\nwhich will encourage the aged as well as the able-bodied    persons   to   continue    living    and\r\n\r\nparticipating in the community. In the planning of\r\n\r\nmore  adequate  services for these  categories  of\r\n\r\npeople   therefore,   both  the   Government   and\r\n\r\nvoluntary welfare organisations have borne in mind\r\n\r\nthe  need  for a balanced approach and have  taken\r\n\r\nsteps  both  to  improve facilities  and  increase\r\n\r\naccommodation in institutions for the aged as well\r\n\r\nas to introduce new services which will enable the\r\n\r\ncontinued  participation  of  the  aged  in   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Government effort is concerned, in\r\n\r\naddition   to   the  construction  of   four   new\r\n\r\ndormitories in the Woodlands Home for the Aged  to\r\n\r\naccommodate a greater number of aged persons,  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Social Welfare is  proposing  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of Area Social Welfare Centres  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious housing estates which will provide,  among\r\n\r\nother services, the establishment of Old\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople's  Clubs  where the  aged  could  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of socialising with others,  engaging\r\n\r\nin  leisure activities and on the whole leading  a\r\n\r\nmore meaningful life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the new thinking not to isolate\r\n\r\nthe   aged  from  the  community,  the  Government\r\n\r\nrecognises the need to assist the aged to continue\r\n\r\nliving with their families. The revised Income Tax\r\n\r\nlaws which allow for tax relief for maintenance of\r\n\r\naged  parents  and grandparents  is  one  of  the\r\n\r\npositive  measures  by  the  Government  in   this\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the voluntary sector, the Singapore Council\r\n\r\nof  Social  Service is setting up a Home  for  the\r\n\r\nAged at Mandai. A community Home for the Aged  in\r\n\r\na  housing  estate  at  Henderson  Hill  has  been\r\n\r\nimplemented successfully, and this has encouraged\r\n\r\nother  efforts by the Singapore Council of Social\r\n\r\nService to explore the possibility of establishing\r\n\r\na  paying  hostel for old people  at  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is envisaged that with the longer life\r\n\r\nexpectation which people now enjoy, the problem of\r\n\r\nthe care of the aged will become more acute.

The\r\n\r\nBoard   will  spend  $40  million  on  management,\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and  repairs in its estates  for  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  fiscal  year.  It hopes  to  recover  $18\r\n\r\nmillion   from  its  collection  of  service   and\r\n\r\nconservancy   charges  at  the  old   rates.   The\r\n\r\nincreases in service and conservancy charges  will\r\n\r\nbring  in  another $15 million, making a total  of\r\n\r\n$33  million. So the Board has still to provide  a\r\n\r\nsubsidy  of  $7  million for the  maintenance  and\r\n\r\nmanagement services to its estates. The  financial\r\n\r\nstatements which I referred to do not include  the\r\n\r\ncapital  costs  of  constructing  swimming  pools,\r\n\r\nsports   complexes  and  recreational  and   other\r\n\r\namenities in the housing estates, nor the increase\r\n\r\nin  loan servicing expected for all new Government\r\n\r\nloans  as  a  result of the new Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that when I announced in\r\n\r\nParliament   on  30th  November  last   year   the\r\n\r\nincreases in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nselling  prices  of Housing Board  flats,  I  also\r\n\r\ninformed  Members that the service and conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges  for HDB flats will be increased  in  1974\r\n\r\nand  that  rentals may be increased. Rentals  have\r\n\r\nnot been increased but the service and conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges  have  been revised with effect  from  1st\r\n\r\nJuly, 1974.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for the revision have been explained\r\n\r\nin  the  press statement issued at the  time.  The\r\n\r\nservice and conservancy charges have never gone up\r\n\r\nsince  1960 when flats were first built for rental\r\n\r\nby  the  Housing and Development  Board  nor  for\r\n\r\nflats  sold under the Home Ownership Scheme, first\r\n\r\nintroduced in 1965. Most of the tenants in  flats\r\n\r\nbuilt by the former Singapore Improvement Trust do\r\n\r\nnot  pay any service and conservancy charges. This\r\n\r\nis an anomaly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 10 years, there have been mounting\r\n\r\nincreases  in  the service and conservancy  costs.\r\n\r\nThe  charges for water used in cleaning the common\r\n\r\nareas  have  increased  by  about  248  per  cent.\r\n\r\nCharges  for electricity for lighting  of  public\r\n\r\nareas,  the  running of lifts and  power  to  pump\r\n\r\nwater  to the roof tank has increased by about  69\r\n\r\nto  70 per cent. Wages of workers and salaries  of\r\n\r\nmanagement  staff  have also increased  with  the\r\n\r\nNational Wages Council recommendations and  higher\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident Fund contributions,  while  the\r\n\r\ninflation in our construction industry has raised\r\n\r\nthe costs of redecoration and maintenance works by\r\n\r\nmore  than 100 per cent. Lift contractors  charged\r\n\r\nfrom  $30 to $50 per month to maintain a lift  in\r\n\r\n1964. Now they charge $80 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents in Housing Board estates now enjoy\r\n\r\nbetter  environment, services and  amenities  than\r\n\r\nthey did 10 years ago. More greenery, gardens  and\r\n\r\nplaygrounds  have  been  added  in  the  estates.\r\n\r\nSports  complexes and swimming pools are  provided\r\n\r\nin  each  new  town.  There  is  emergency  repair\r\n\r\nservice  round the clock for repairs to electrical\r\n\r\nand  sanitary fittings in their flats.  They  can\r\n\r\ncall  upon  the service of the Lift  Rescue  Unit.\r\n\r\nResidents  will  enjoy  even  better  environment,\r\n\r\nservices and amenities \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the   future.  Swimming  pools  and  other  sports\r\n\r\nfacilities  are  being  extended  to  old  housing\r\n\r\nestates.  The  first such swimming pool  is  under\r\n\r\nconstruction for the Old Kallang Airport  and  Tan\r\n\r\njong  Rhu Estates. Other swimming pools are  being\r\n\r\nplanned  for  the  Bukit  Ho  Swee  and  Alexandra\r\n\r\nEstates   while  a  sports  complex   will   serve\r\n\r\nresidents   in  the  Tiong  Bahru,   Redhill   and\r\n\r\nHenderson Road Estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in service and conservancy charges\r\n\r\nhas  been  modest. They appear large only  because\r\n\r\nthey  had not been gradually adjusted since  1960.\r\n\r\nFor the 66,744 owners of Housing Board flats, the\r\n\r\nmaximum  increase (for the larger-sized flats)  is\r\n\r\nonly  $10 per month. Fifty-five per cent of  these\r\n\r\nowners  are  using their CPF credits  to  pay  for\r\n\r\ntheir  flats. The only cash outlay per month  for\r\n\r\ntheir homes is the service and conservancy charges\r\n\r\nand property tax, which together come to less than\r\n\r\nthe rental they would otherwise have to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board subsidises the\r\n\r\nrents of tenants. It cannot subsidise increases in\r\n\r\nservice   and  conservancy  charges.  The   90,450\r\n\r\ntenants  of  Housing Board fiats,  who  previously\r\n\r\nenjoyed lower service and conservancy charges than\r\n\r\nowners,  have  to pay the same rate as  owners  of\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats. But to minimise hardship, the\r\n\r\nincrease  ranging  from $6 for 1-room  (emergency)\r\n\r\nflats   to  $18.50  for  4-room  flats,  is  being\r\n\r\nimplemented in two stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To equalise subsidies between old and new flats,\r\n\r\nservice and conservancy charges for sold SIT flats\r\n\r\nare  now  the  same as for owners  of  HDB  flats.\r\n\r\n14,990  tenants of SIT flats will now pay service\r\n\r\nand  conservancy charges similar to  HDB  tenants.\r\n\r\nThese  SIT tenants have been enjoying free service\r\n\r\nand  conservancy for the last 17 years. This  was\r\n\r\ndue  to an administrative oversight. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\nto   relieve  hardship,  the  Housing  Board   has\r\n\r\nimplemented the increase of these charges also  in\r\n\r\ntwo stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has to revise\r\n\r\nthe  service and conservancy charges to  be  more\r\n\r\nequal in its treatment of old and new tenants, and\r\n\r\nbetween owner-owned and rented, premises.

In the same way, notices  had  to  be\r\n\r\nserved  on owners of flats, telling them that  the\r\n\r\nold  rates  do not apply and that new  rates  will\r\n\r\napply as from the 1st of July. Under the terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  tenancy  agreement, of which I have  a  blank\r\n\r\ncopy here, clause 18 reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`all notices, including notices to quit, which\r\n\r\nthe  Board  may require to be given to the  tenant\r\n\r\nshall  be  in  writing and shall be deemed  to  be\r\n\r\nsufficiently served if they are posted  upon  some\r\n\r\nconspicuous  part of the premises or if  they  are\r\n\r\naddressed  to  the  tenant  at  the  premises  and\r\n\r\nforwarded by AR registered post.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>To  have served nearly 196,000 occupiers  of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  with  letters by AR registered  post  would\r\n\r\nhave  cost  a  lot of money.

They come by way of better and healthier\r\n\r\ncitizens. Besides, nowadays tenants and occupiers\r\n\r\nof  Housing Board flats expect swimming pools  and\r\n\r\nparks. When the Housing Board first built flats in\r\n\r\n1960, all  it did was to provide homes with  very\r\n\r\nlittle recreational or sports facilities. But our\r\n\r\nstandards have gone up and their demands have gone\r\n\r\nup,   and   we  will  provide  these  sports   and\r\n\r\nrecreational facilities even if we lose  money  on\r\n\r\nthem.  I think the dividends that come by  way  of\r\n\r\nhigher  standards of sports, or healthier citizens\r\n\r\n(social  dividends if you like) are  really  worth\r\n\r\nthe money spent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TOURIST AGENCIES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Complaints against and plans to control)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance (a) how many travel  or  tour\r\n\r\nagencies have been registered with his Ministry to\r\n\r\ndate;  (b)  how many of them are ticket agents  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Airlines; (c) how many of them  are\r\n\r\nconducting  overseas group tours; (d) whether  and\r\n\r\nhow many complaints of breach of contract against\r\n\r\ntravel   agencies  have  been  lodged   with   the\r\n\r\nAuthorities  by  persons who had  participated  in\r\n\r\ngroup tours; and (e) whether his Ministry plans to\r\n\r\ntighten\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrol over group tour orientated travel agencies\r\n\r\nin order to save the public from being taken for a\r\n\r\nride by fly-by-night travel agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion Board has since December 1970 introduced\r\n\r\nthe  Tourist Promotion (Licensing and  Control  of\r\n\r\nTourist  Agencies)  Regulations  to  license  and\r\n\r\ncontrol  tour agencies.

Where\r\n\r\nservices  rendered have been poor,  the  agencies\r\n\r\nhave been warned to maintain a reasonable standard\r\n\r\nor  have  their licences revoked.

The need for such a legislation\r\n\r\nhas  become  even more pressing  with  the  rapid\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Singapore  into  an  industrial,\r\n\r\ncommercial   and  communications  centre.   Such\r\n\r\ndevelopment   entails   the   installation    and\r\n\r\noperation   of   complex  electrical   equipment\r\n\r\noperating   at  increasingly  higher  power   and\r\n\r\nvoltage levels, with inherent problems of  safety\r\n\r\nand    requiring   competent   workmanship    and\r\n\r\nsupervision.   This   need   has   been   further\r\n\r\nreinforced   by  the  recommendations   of   the\r\n\r\nCommission  of Inquiry into the Robinson's  Fire.\r\n\r\nWhilst some form of legislation could be achieved\r\n\r\nby   means   of  Regulations  under  the   Public\r\n\r\nUtilities   Act,  legal  opinion  is   that   the\r\n\r\nlicensing  system contemplated would  require  an\r\n\r\nAct   of  Parliament  rather  than  a  subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Professional Engineers Act, 1970, prohibits\r\n\r\nanyone  other  than professional  engineers  with\r\n\r\nprescribed   qualifications  from   engaging   in\r\n\r\nelectrical  work. It also regulates  the  ethical\r\n\r\nconduct  of  such professional engineers.  It  is\r\n\r\nthus,   apparently,  limited   to   professional\r\n\r\nengineers and to those exempted under the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Professional Engineers Act stands, it\r\n\r\nwill   not   be   possible,  unless  specifically\r\n\r\nexempted,  for electrical contractors, artisans,\r\n\r\ncraftsmen    and   technicians   to    undertake\r\n\r\nelectrical  work. These grades of  workers  exist\r\n\r\nand are necessary in the engineering field. Such\r\n\r\nelectrical    workers   should   be    licensed,\r\n\r\ncontrolled and regulated. The Electrical Workers\r\n\r\nand  Contractors Licensing Bill now  before  this\r\n\r\nHouse has, therefore, been specially drawn up  to\r\n\r\ncover  these  categories. Professional  engineers\r\n\r\nengaged  in  electrical power  engineering  work\r\n\r\nhave  also been included in this Bill. The Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board at present registers  electrical\r\n\r\ncontractors  to provide an ancillary  engineering\r\n\r\nservice.  There  is, however, no registration  of\r\n\r\nelectrical  workers.  Even  the  registration  of\r\n\r\nelectrical  contractors  lacks  legal  powers  to\r\n\r\nregulate their duties and res-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nponsibilities.  The  Board can  only  deregister\r\n\r\nthem.  The  Bill  now makes a  clear  distinction\r\n\r\nbetween  an  electrical worker  involved  in  the\r\n\r\npersonal performance of electrical work, and  an\r\n\r\nelectrical contractor who, in the course of or in\r\n\r\nconnection with any trade or business, carries on\r\n\r\nelectrical work. The classification of electrical\r\n\r\nworkers  according to qualifications, duties  and\r\n\r\ndegree of responsibility and the licences  to  be\r\n\r\nissued will be spelt out in the Regulations to be\r\n\r\nmade under the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The particular licence would specify the scope\r\n\r\nof  the electrical work to be carried out and any\r\n\r\nrestrictions  in regard to the type  of  work  or\r\n\r\nclass   of  electrical  installations,   or   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances or manner in which the  holder  of\r\n\r\nthe   licence   may   perform  electrical   work.\r\n\r\nProvisions have been made in the Bill  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat it is not too restrictive in its operation,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  regard  to  contractors  on   the\r\n\r\nBoard's  temporary register. I will also move  an\r\n\r\namendment  to  the Bill in Committee  which  will\r\n\r\nensure that bona fide users of electricity may be\r\n\r\nable to perform simple electrical operations such\r\n\r\nas  changing an electric lamp bulb and  replacing\r\n\r\nany fuse in premises used for dwelling purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall aim of the Bill, therefore, is to\r\n\r\nachieve   licensing  and  control  of  electrical\r\n\r\ncontractors and electrical workers with a view to\r\n\r\nensuring  that they will render good  service  to\r\n\r\nthose  who employ them. Penalties in the form  of\r\n\r\nfines  and/or  imprisonment  or  both  have  been\r\n\r\nprovided under the Bill, and convey the assurance\r\n\r\nthat  by reason of their qualifications they will\r\n\r\nperform  electrical work in a safe and  efficient\r\n\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Bill now\r\n\r\nbeing  read  a Second time.

Among  them  are   professional\r\n\r\nengineers, holders of diplomas from the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic,  technicians  who  have  completed  a\r\n\r\nprescribed course in the vocational institutes and\r\n\r\ncontractors who, from long association with  their\r\n\r\nwork, are considered to be competent to deal  with\r\n\r\nelectrical  work.

Not\r\n\r\nonly  are substantial amendments proposed  to  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Part  V  dealing with the  licensing  of\r\n\r\neiectrical  and supply installation  (as  defined)\r\n\r\nbut  a  new  Part  VA  is  also  proposed,  which\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the  licensing  of  water   service\r\n\r\nworkers, such as plumbers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While drafting the Electricity Regulations,\r\n\r\nunder  sections 62 and 88 of the Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nAct,  the  Public Utilities Board  recognised  the\r\n\r\nnecessity for recommending amendments to  Part  V.\r\n\r\nThis  Part,  as  it  stands,  is  limited  in  its\r\n\r\napplication   to  private  electrical  generating\r\n\r\nplant. The increasing use of electricity in major\r\n\r\nindustries,   highrise  buildings  and   shopping\r\n\r\ncomplexes  poses  the  problem  of  ensuring   the\r\n\r\nperiodical inspection of electrical installations.\r\n\r\nThe  necessity for legislation in this  regard  is\r\n\r\ndictated  primarily  by safety considerations  in\r\n\r\nplaces  of  all public concourse. This is  further\r\n\r\nunderlined  by the recent recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nCommission   of   Inquiry  into   the   Robinson's\r\n\r\nDepartmental Store fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission's first recommendation, Sir,\r\n\r\nis   that  for  electrical  installations  of   a\r\n\r\nstipulated higher current rating, consideration be\r\n\r\ngiven  by the Public Utilities Board to grade  the\r\n\r\nlicensing  of electrical workers with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nensuring  that  only personnel with the  requisite\r\n\r\nprofessional expertise and experience  be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  undertake such work. This has been taken  into\r\n\r\naccount  in the Electrical Workers and Contractors\r\n\r\nLicensing  Bill,  1974, which is  now  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In proposing these amendments, Sir, full\r\n\r\nconsideration  has also been given to  the  second\r\n\r\nrecommendation, that is, for a system of  periodic\r\n\r\ninspection of places of public concourse  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  appropriate  authorities  may  be  aware   of\r\n\r\nunauthorised additions or alterations which  might\r\n\r\nendanger the safety of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed to Part V of the Act are\r\n\r\nsignificant in that they would have the effect  of\r\n\r\nmaking    it    mandatory   for   all   electrical\r\n\r\ninstallations,   including   private    electrical\r\n\r\ngenerating plants except those owned and  operated\r\n\r\nby   the   Board,  Government,  other   statutory\r\n\r\nauthorities,   or  those  used  exclusively   for\r\n\r\ndomestic  purposes,  to  be  licensed  and  to  be\r\n\r\nsupervised  or operated by such class of  licensed\r\n\r\nelectrical  workers  as  are  prescribed  in   the\r\n\r\nElectrical  Workers  and  Contractors   Licensing\r\n\r\nBill, 1974, and ensure also that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a licensee of an installation must cause an\r\n\r\ninstallation to be inspected at such intervals  as\r\n\r\nthe B'oard may deem necessary;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) an inspection as required by a licensee must\r\n\r\nbe  carried out by such licensed electrical worker\r\n\r\nas  the  Board  may direct; on completion  of  the\r\n\r\ninspection a Certificate as to the fitness of  the\r\n\r\ninstallation  for  licensing  purposes   must   be\r\n\r\nissued by a licensed electrical worker;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) specified procedures are observed in case of\r\n\r\ndangerous defects in installations;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) serious accidents and the investigation\r\n\r\nthereof are reported;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) installations existing before the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncommencement  of the amending Act are  subject  to\r\n\r\nthe Act and the Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the Board at the present time does\r\n\r\noperate  an  administrative system of  registering\r\n\r\nplumbers, it lacks the legal power to regulate the\r\n\r\nduties  and  responsibilities of such plumbers.  A\r\n\r\nnew  Part VA has accordingly been introduced  into\r\n\r\nthe  Act  to  remedy  this deficiency.  A  licence\r\n\r\ngranted to a water service worker will specify the\r\n\r\nscope of the water service work to be carried  out\r\n\r\nand  any  restrictions in regard to  the  type  of\r\n\r\nwork,  or class of water service installation,  or\r\n\r\nthe circumstances or manner in which the holder of\r\n\r\nthe  licence may perform water service  work.  New\r\n\r\ndefinitions   of  \"water  service  installation\",\r\n\r\n\"water  service  work\" and \"water service  worker\"\r\n\r\nhave been included in this Part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 19 (3) of the Act, as it stands, does not\r\n\r\nempower  the  Board to enforce any  limitation  of\r\n\r\nsupply or to cut off supply made necessary in  the\r\n\r\npublic interest.\r\n\r\nThe need for amending this subsection became clear\r\n\r\nwhen   consideration  was  being  given   to   the\r\n\r\nintroduction   of  surcharges   in   the   Tariff\r\n\r\nRegulations  by  which the Board sought  to  limit\r\n\r\nconsumption of electricity to consumers,  and  in\r\n\r\nthe   event   of   any  consumer  exceeding   that\r\n\r\nlimitation  to  impose  a  surcharge.  Under   the\r\n\r\nexisting provisions, the Board would not  be  able\r\n\r\nto  cut off the supply of electricity to offenders\r\n\r\nwho   flagrantly  disregard  the   limitation   of\r\n\r\nconsumption  without prosecuting them.  Subsection\r\n\r\n19 (3) of the Act has, therefore, been amended to\r\n\r\nconfer  that power on the Board in this  situation\r\n\r\nor  in other situations in which the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe   public  are  affected.  Again,  Sir,  a  new\r\n\r\nsubsection (4) has been inserted in section 19  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  Board  to  cut  off  the  supply   of\r\n\r\nelectricity   to  any  person  who   operates   an\r\n\r\nelectrical  or  supply  installation   without   a\r\n\r\nlicence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments appearing in the Bill have\r\n\r\nthe   effect  of  increasing  the  penalties   for\r\n\r\ncontravention  of the Act. The existing  penalties\r\n\r\nhave   not  been  changed  since  1963  and   have\r\n\r\ntherefore ceased to be realistic as a deterrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 1 would like to\r\n\r\nask  a  point  of information from the  Minister.\r\n\r\nSince   the   Bill  requires  every   electrician,\r\n\r\nwireman,  and so on, to be registered or qualified\r\n\r\nbefore he could handle any electrical work, may  I\r\n\r\nknow  whether there is any examination board where\r\n\r\npeople  who seek to be qualified electricians  can\r\n\r\nbe tested?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, there are many institutions\r\n\r\nwhich conduct courses in electricity.

But  we\r\n\r\nnow   have   the   vocational   institutes,   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic, and the University, and I think they\r\n\r\nshould  be  able  to  turn out  enough  electrical\r\n\r\nworkers for our needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, this information is not\r\n\r\nenough to satisfy me.

Members would have read this report  of  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee.  There  are,  however,  certain\r\n\r\nimportant  recommendations in the  report  of  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee which I would like to  bring  to\r\n\r\nthe attention of Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, one of the most important\r\n\r\nrecommendations made by the Select Committee is in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the proposed management  shares  that\r\n\r\nwill  have to be issued by newspapers required  to\r\n\r\ngo  public. These will have to be paid for at  the\r\n\r\nprevailing market price of the ordinary shares  of\r\n\r\na newspaper company, that is, such price as would\r\n\r\nprevail   at  the  date  of  the  issue   of   the\r\n\r\nmanagement shares. It follows, accordingly,  that\r\n\r\nif a particular company's shares are quoted on the\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange, it is the market price ruling  on\r\n\r\nthat  day that would be taken as the value  to  be\r\n\r\nattached  to  management shares so issued.  Where,\r\n\r\nhowever,  the company's shares are not so  quoted,\r\n\r\nthere  would  be no ready yardstick which  can  be\r\n\r\napplied.   The   recommendation  of   the   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  therefore,  is  that  such  shares  of\r\n\r\nunquoted  companies would be issued at  such  fair\r\n\r\nand  reasonable value as may be determined by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  In  order that the  valuation  of  such\r\n\r\nshares may not be arbitrarily imposed, it has been\r\n\r\nsuggested  that that valuation be made subject  to\r\n\r\nreview  by  the courts. Accordingly, the  Bill  in\r\n\r\naccordance    with    the    Select    Committee's\r\n\r\nrecommendation, now makes the Minister's valuation\r\n\r\nsubject to appeal to the courts. Even without such\r\n\r\nprovision in the law, I would like to assure  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers that such valuation as may be given by the\r\n\r\nMinister  would have to be based on expert  advice\r\n\r\nfrom  persons  such as qualified  accountants  who\r\n\r\nwould  be  required to go through recent  accounts\r\n\r\nand  annual  reports of newspapers.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nwould    also   have   in   mind   various   other\r\n\r\nconsiderations  such as up-to-date  valuations  of\r\n\r\nimmovable   property,  machinery,  fixtures   and\r\n\r\nfitting  of  a newspaper company when  seeking  to\r\n\r\narrive at a fair and reasonable valuation of  such\r\n\r\nshares.  However,  with  this  specific  provision\r\n\r\nallowing  shareholders of newspaper companies,  or\r\n\r\nthe companies themselves to seek such redress  as\r\n\r\nthey  may  require on valuation, there  should  be\r\n\r\nadequate   safeguards  against  arbitrary   values\r\n\r\nplaced  upon  these unquoted shares  of  companies\r\n\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second recommendation of the Select Committee\r\n\r\nwhich  I would like to touch upon is in regard  to\r\n\r\nthe  greater voting rights conferred on management\r\n\r\nshareholders. Such superior voting rights can only\r\n\r\nbe used in respect of any resolution touching upon\r\n\r\nthe  appointment or dismissal of any director  or\r\n\r\nany  member of the staff of a newspaper  company.\r\n\r\nIn   regard  to  other  matters,  the  holder   of\r\n\r\nmanagement  shares will rank pan  passu  with  the\r\n\r\nholder  of  ordinary  shares of  a  company.  This\r\n\r\nrecommendation   gives  effect   to   Government's\r\n\r\ndeclared  policy that it is not its  intention  to\r\n\r\nupset  the  commercial  operations  of  newspaper\r\n\r\ncompanies   nor  to  interfere  in  the   routine\r\n\r\nmanagement of newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another useful recommendation of the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee is the transitional provisions contained\r\n\r\nin  clause  36 of the Bill. As in all  probability\r\n\r\nsome  newspapers that are required to  go  public\r\n\r\nwill  find  it  difficult, if not  impossible,  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with all the provisions of this Act before\r\n\r\nit  comes  into operation, it is thought necessary\r\n\r\nthat transitional provisions be inserted. It is to\r\n\r\nprovide   for   the   possibility   of   newspaper\r\n\r\ncompanies finding it difficult to suitably  amend\r\n\r\ntheir  memorandum and articles of  association  in\r\n\r\ntime and to the satisfaction of the Registrar  of\r\n\r\nNewspapers, and to accommodate them in  regard  to\r\n\r\nother  procedural  requirements which  they  might\r\n\r\nhave  to  comply  in the issue  of  shares,  these\r\n\r\ntransitional   provisions   have   been   devised.\r\n\r\nAlthough  ample  notice  has  been  given  to  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  of Government's intention  to  require\r\n\r\nnewspapers  in Singapore to become public  limited\r\n\r\ncompanies,  it is to ensure that such requirements\r\n\r\nthat  may be imposed may not unduly interfere with\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary business of a newspaper, that  these\r\n\r\ntransitional  provisions have  been  inserted.  To\r\n\r\nthis  end,  clause  36 of the Bill  in  particular\r\n\r\nprovides  that  the chief editor of any  newspaper\r\n\r\nrequired to comply with the requirements of  Part\r\n\r\nIII   of  this  Act  shall  be  granted  a  permit\r\n\r\nauthorising the publication of a newspaper  up  to\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincluding 30th June, 1975, on the undertaking  by\r\n\r\nthe  chief  editor of such newspaper  in  writing\r\n\r\nthat   he  will  convert  his  newspaper  into   a\r\n\r\nnewspaper company. Even so, any newspaper that  is\r\n\r\nunable  to meet this deadline of 30th June,  1975,\r\n\r\nmay  apply  for  further  period  or  periods  of\r\n\r\nextension,  subject  to  such  conditions  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister may see fit to impose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Select Committee has recommended\r\n\r\nthat appeal should lie to the President in respect\r\n\r\nof  every  decision made by the  Minister  in  the\r\n\r\nexercise  of  discretionary powers,  for  example,\r\n\r\nwhether to refuse or grant his approval under Part\r\n\r\nIII  of  the  Act  or whether to grant  or  refuse\r\n\r\nfurther extensions of time under clause 36. It  is\r\n\r\nhoped  that  this  will allay  any  fears  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  acting arbitrarily when  exercising  his\r\n\r\npowers  of  discretion under  the  Newspaper  and\r\n\r\nPrinting Presses Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad that the committal of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill to a Select Committee has provided  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for interested parties to  air  their\r\n\r\nviews.  It  has  enabled the Select  Committee  to\r\n\r\nrecommend   some   very   important   and   useful\r\n\r\namendments.  The Bill as amended is in  conformity\r\n\r\nwith  Government's declared policy. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  assure  Members  that the  Government  has  no\r\n\r\nintention whatsoever of taking over the press  nor\r\n\r\ndoes it want to upset the commercial operations of\r\n\r\nany   newspaper.   The  sole   purpose   of   this\r\n\r\nlegislation  is,  and  I  emphasise,   merely   to\r\n\r\nsafeguard our national interest and the well-being\r\n\r\nof our citizens by preventing our newspapers from\r\n\r\nbeing used as instruments for subversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RECLAMATION AT TERUMBU RETAN LAUT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.
