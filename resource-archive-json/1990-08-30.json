The press is free to report on any factual matters concerning National Servicemen, unless of course such information has security implications. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Servicemen may not communicate with the press on SAF matters without written permission from the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence. This is to maintain security and military discipline. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are existing channels within the SAF for servicemen to lodge complaints. If a serviceman is not satisfied with the outcome, he can seek redress by writing directly to the Armed Forces Council, the highest body in the SAF. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Defence has also written to inform all MPs of the procedures to follow should they wish to take up with Mindef any cases involving their constituents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindef investigates every such complaint thoroughly. If any wrongdoing is found, the culprits will be punished. But if the complaint proves to be unfounded and vexatious, the SAF will take disciplinary action against the serviceman who made it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ROADSIDE TREES</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Monitoring of condition)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether his Ministry has monitored the condition of roadside trees with a view to cutting down old and diseased trees before they are likely to be uprooted in a storm thereby causing injury to people or damage to property. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Lee Boon Yang) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is yes.

But sometimes we fall short of our ideals, Sir. As we all know, in any organisation, there will always be a few black sheep and it will not, therefore, be fair to generalise and white-wash the entire inspectorate force of my Ministry because of these few black sheep. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, public health inspectors are performing a very demanding yet unpleasant job. Being enforcement officers, they can easily become targets of complaints by those whom they have to bring the law to bear. I must say that the public health inspectors have, in general, projected themselves rather well when dealing with \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> hawkers, operators of food establishments and members of the public. However, having said this, I want to assure the House that my Ministry takes a very serious view against any officer found to be rude or arrogant. Every complaint received is thoroughly investigated by the Staff Inspectorate Unit of my Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past 12 months, Sir, my Ministry received complaints of alleged rudeness against six public health inspectors, who comprise less than 1% of the total public health inspectorate force. The six complaints were thoroughly investigated and found to be unsubstantiated. During the same period, Sir, my Ministry took disciplinary action against two public health inspectors and four public health overseers for various acts of misconduct. Another eight cases of misconduct are pending investigations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the information of the House, Sir, all rank and file of the public health inspectorate have been trained on communication skills and how to be tactful when dealing with members of the public, including hawkers and coffee shop operators. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FOOD POISONING CASES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.

Other types of food establishments, such as snack bars, confectionery, food catering premises and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> residential homes, accounted for the remaining incidents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 39 restaurants implicated, 18 were located in the city area.

May I, with your permission, answer them together? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You may. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> The quota system has been in operation for the past four months since 1st May 1990. It has provided us with effective control over the growth of vehicles in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on feedback from the public, my Ministry has made two minor adjustments. Effective 1st July, 1990, tenders are held monthly instead of quarterly, and the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> temporary Certificate of Entitlement (TCOE) is now valid for three months instead of the previous six. Overall, the number of bids has come down from 21,700 in April to 14,900 in July and then further down to 9,700 in August. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the TCOEs are made transferable for a simple reason -to enable those who did not tender or were unsuccessful in the tender to obtain a COE from the secondary market. Transferability, in other words, buying and selling, is the basis of a free market. It allows market forces to arrive at the best assessment of current values of economic resources. That way, it provides for their efficient and effective distribution. The transfer price between a willing seller and a willing buyer reflects the market value. Of course, the market values of goods and services vary with time and circumstances. Such changes occasionally can be sharp and sudden. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been some interest among the public on the issue of the transferability of COEs. So let me take a little time and explain it as simply as possible. Let me illustrate how transferability works in our daily lives. Each day, we use or consume hundreds of items which we buy, not directly from the original producers, but from supermarkets, shops and hawker stalls, which in turn buy and sell these items freely. For example, do we require consumers to buy rice from the farmers directly? Do we require consumers to buy fish from the fishermen directly? Do we require consumers to buy shoes from the manufacturers directly? The answer is no. Similarly, we allow the resale of cars between private individuals in private transactions. We allow the sale of cars through second-hand car dealers. We cannot effectively stop transferability of TCOEs unless we also prohibit the resale of cars among individuals or through second-hand car dealers. Therefore, to compel every car buyer to get a COE directly from ROV only is impractical. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Wang has also asked about the price between the buyers and sellers. The prices of COEs on the secondary market, are private transactions between willing buyers and willing sellers, and ROV is not privy to such information. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unhappiness about the quota system centred round two main complaints. Often these two complaints are levelled together by the same individual or in the same newspaper article or editorial or the same consumer or motoring group. What are these two complaints? First, they complained that the quota premiums are too high, in other words, higher than what the bona fide buyer is prepared to pay and that this is a result of speculation made possible by transferability. Second, they complained that the speculators, people who resell their COEs, are making a lot of money by selling the COEs at a higher price. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who made these two complaints missed the fact that if they look at these two complaints objectively, the two complaints are contradictory. If the quota premiums are too high, higher than what bona fide buyers are willing to pay, then how can the speculators resell their COEs for a profit and make a lot of money? And if the people who resell their COEs, indeed, do make a lot of money, how can the premiums be too high? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the quota system has been in place for the last four months. It has worked well. It has served its fundamental objective, which is to restrain the growth of cars. My Ministry will continue to monitor the operation of the system and, where necessary, we will make the appropriate changes in due course. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister, since he did not address my question, whether the implementation of the vehicle quota system has met with his expectations? I assume that it has indeed met with his expectations. And if so, may I ask the Minister, in view of his own admission that speculators make a lot of money, how could he consider the implementation satisfactory when he had said these in Parliament on two occasions, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But I want to assure the House that the scheme will be devised in a manner that will not permit a cartel to be formed, nor would we allow people to use the quota system as means for speculation.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>And further in response to another question on speculation, he had further declared very categorically in this House: \"Don't try it!\" And I believe that this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> remark had left an indelible impression on all who had watched him on television. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister take this opportunity to enlighten the public on what he meant by these statements? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> The Member has asked a number of questions and also made a number of assumptions. I will try and take them as they come. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did say in my reply earlier on that the scheme had met the objectives that we set out, namely, to restrain the growth of vehicles. So, yes, the scheme has worked out well. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, whether the speculators, as have been called by the media and also by some other people, have made a lot of money, I have mentioned earlier that the ROV is not privy to, or does not know, what the transaction prices are. These are private transactions between individuals. I think many people have made a number of guesses. Whether those guesses represent the actual transacted prices, it is not possible for ROV to know. It is like people claiming that they sold their flat or their house for so many thousand dollars. It is not provable unless you are prepared to go and ask the individuals concerned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Member said that I advised people not to speculate. That is true, Sir. I advised Singaporeans not to speculate, because those who are familiar with speculations know that in the long run, speculators inevitably get their fingers burnt. There has been a lot of research done overseas where people speculate in money, in gold, in rubber, in wheat, in pork belly. And the established conclusion is that most speculators end up getting their fingers burnt. Sure, it is true sometimes speculators get short runs of good luck, and those are the occasions when they make money. But in the long term, speculators get their fingers burnt, and it is in that context that I advised Singaporeans not to try speculation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether my following line of reasoning is correct, since he did not answer my question on what is the sum \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> total of the excess the public has paid over and above the bid prices? The quota system has been in place for four months and every month --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Wang, are you making a speech? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I am asking a question, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Ask your question then. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I would like to find out whether my figure is correct if we assume that the number of quotas per month is 3,500, and for each quota being transferred, the average excess the public pay over the bid price is from $500 to $1,000. If you multiply the period that the quota system has been in place, the excess which the individual has paid over and above amounts to either $14 million or a ballpark figure of that amount. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is my argument correct? And if so, would he not consider this a loss to the state coffers, even though I agree with him that the actual price of the COE should be determined by market force? But, nonetheless, this transfer between private individuals should be considered a loss to the state coffers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, Dr Wang is a specialist in computers. I am sure his arithmetic is correct if he puts the correct numbers in. But, first of all, where did he get the numbers which he had begun with, as far as the transfer prices are concerned? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said a moment ago that the resale of the COEs is something between individuals. We do not have the numbers. We do not know exactly what they are transacted at. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Mr Speaker, perhaps the Minister can provide some figures to show that out of all those who have successfully bid for a Certificate, how many of them have actually bought a car with the Certificate, how many of them have actually transferred or sold the Certificate, obviously for a profit, and how many of them are still holding on to the Certificate hoping to make more profits. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I do not have the figures with me at the moment. I believe \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> they had been given in reply to questions in the press sometime back. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Does the Minister agree that fixing a quota is a means to raising of prices, for example, OPEC? If there is a quotaa, how does he square it with the so-called free market? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, it is a very long jump from the quota for the number of cars allowed on the very limited roads that we have in Singapore to the cartel that the OPEC has. I wish OPEC will allow people all over the world to tender for oil that they have, rather than squeeze the consumers worldwide by attempting to fix an artificially high rate and turning down the supply of oil. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we allow a quota because we know the rate at which we are building roads in Singapore. And knowing that, if we allow unrestrained growth in the number of vehicles in Singapore, we are going to end up like all the other major cities in the world where people have cars, but cars do not move. That is not we think will contribute to the growth of our economy and to a better quality of life for Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tiong Bahru GRC):</b> Sir, on the question of speculation, will the Minister consider administrative measures to slow down speculation, for example, by reporting those regular successful bidders to the Income Tax Department? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I have no doubt that the Commissioner for Inland Revenue knows how to look out for people who are not making the appropriate reports of profits made. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, after the stirring speech on free market and free competition, I would like to ask the Minister to look at other areas where the Government has really put a spoke in the operation of a free market.

Is your question related to the question asked by Dr Wang? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my question will be related to the explanation that the Minister has given to the question asked by Dr Wang. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. Ask your question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, the Minister has asked specifically for the type of laws. I have said that there is an anti-touting law on cinema tickets, and that is a law passed by the Government, and in this particular law it is an offence for people to buy too many tickets for resale purposes. And I see this as no different from the quota system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> So, what is your question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I am answering the question . In this case, the Minister has asked me to be more specific, and I have provided the answer to that question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I thank the Member for obviously supporting the position of the Government in allowing transferability of TCOEs. I believe it is the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for matters on collection of duty. I will ask the Minister for Finance to arrange for his officials to have a look at it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister whether he agrees that the quota allocation for cars in the category of 2,000 litres and above is too high, since the quota premium has been consistently lower for cars in the lower category as well? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister not agree that the system is not working well when those who can afford bigger cars pay less, and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> while those who cannot afford bigger cars pay more? And will he consider changing the allocation as soon as possible? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, the Member has said that the people who could afford pay less in terms of taxes. I think if you take a look at the various schemes that are currently in place, it need not necessarily be true that people buying bigger cars are paying less in terms of total taxes paid, because the ARF, the road taxes, etc are much higher. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my question was very specific, ie, you either pay more or you pay less for COE, depending on which category you are bidding. I am not talking about total taxation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I do not want to take up too much time because there are other Members who have got various questions to be answered. So let me answer briefly. It is not so much the cost of a COE per se that the buyer of a car is interested in. The buyer of a car is interested in the total sum of money that he has got to pay to own a car. So when there are other taxes which are relatively high, the COE may on certain occasions be a little lower than the premium in another category. But we also have to bear in mind that the OMV of vehicles are coming down, the ARF is being lowered, the anticipation of end-of-year demand. These are some of the factors which affect the amount of money that potential car buyers are willing to bid for the COE. The cost of a COE is determined by the market. It is not determined by the Ministry. And we should allow the potential car buyers to decide for themselves how much they are willing to pay for the COE. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he agrees that we are not talking about the free market situation in the quota system. The supply of the COEs is determined by the Ministry, and given a certain number, the market then determines the quota premium. By changing the number of supply, the Ministry can actually change the prevailing premium of that particular category. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what I am asking the Minister is whether he agrees that in the current system, based on historical data, the allocation given for cars higher than 2,000 litres has been too high. And in my judgment, I believe it is. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, the allocations were arrived at based on last year's distribution of vehicles in the different categories and their growth. If we follow the argument of Dr Wang and take it seriously, and that just because the luxury cars have got a lower quota premium compared with the big cars, that figure is therefore too generous, we should, therefore, reduce it. If we take that kind of argument to its logical conclusion, then we must also cut down very sharply on the number of motor-cycles because the quota premium for motor-cycles is very, very low. If we follow Dr Wang's logic, then the conclusion is that we have given too large a number for motor-cycles and, therefore, we should cut it down. In effect, we should allow only one single class of vehicles and let everybody bid for that one single category and have only one Premium. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has talked about fallacious statements made by people who have asked questions. I just want to point out that the Minister's statement is concerning the quota and the free market is also fallacious. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, could you ask the question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Already, Dr Wang has said that if the quota should be raised, then the prices would be entirely different, but now - - - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, could you ask the question? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Yes. I just want to say that he has not answered my question and, therefore, would he really answer my question about how he would square up a quota with free enterprise. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, quota squares up with the free enterprise very simply. In any given year, there is a certain amount of rice produced worldwide. So it is fixed and the free market will decide how much you want to pay for the rice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any given year, there are only so many kilometres of roads that we are going to put on. If we set off with the basic assumption that we do not want our roads to be over-congested, then the number of vehicles that we allow will have to be fixed. There is nothing incompatible with a given supply and allowing the market to determine what the price for that particular resource should be. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>'HALF-TANK' RULE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Relaxation)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. \n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will relax the `half-tank' rule so that oil companies do not have a protected market. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister of State for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Finance (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of my Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would recall that the half-tank rule was introduced on 17th April last year to ensure that cheaper Johor petrol would not undermine our use of petrol tax as a means of curbing car usage in Singapore and to reduce the associated loss of duty on petrol purchased outside Singapore. The half-tank rule was chosen from amongst several alternatives as a measure which would not discourage Singapore motorists from visiting Johor. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 16 months of operating experience, the Finance Minister is satisfied that the half-tank rule has worked satisfactorily in achieving our objectives. Statistics at the Woodlands Checkpoint show that the introduction of the half-tank rule has not reduced the flow of Singapore-registered cars into Johor. For the period January to July this year, the average daily outflow of Singapore cars was 7,100 compared to an average of 6,800 before the rule was introduced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is happy to see Singaporeans visit Johor for their shopping and leisure in order to take advantage of the lower prices there but the half-tank rule cannot be relaxed until a better alternative is found to achieve the same objectives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of whether the oil companies operate in a protected market, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which I believe is really at the bottom of Mr Chng's question, the Minister for Trade and Industry will answer this fully in his reply to the next two questions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, will the Minister of State consider supplementing the half-tank rule with a half-tank petrol tax, so that consumers are free to purchase petrol wherever they like? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The alternative of an exit levy, or whatever we want to call it, was seriously considered when the proposal was being formulated last year. We did not implement it because it would have been misconstrued as an exit tax, as a policy to discourage Singapore motorists from visiting Malaysia. So for that reason, we adopted the indirect approach of the half-tank rule. The effect is largely the same. For each approach, there are pros and cons, but since the half-tank rule has worked well and the dust has settled, we should stick to it. But at the same time, we still keep open the alternative of an exit levy for the future should new needs compel us to re-evaluate our position. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the exit tax on petrol which I am suggesting is not the same as the exit tax in other countries. Can the Minister confirm that the exit tax in other countries apply to individuals? Here Singaporeans who go to Johor on foot, by bus, or by rail, are not penalised at all under the half-tank tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, though Mr Chng is logically correct, I do not think the public perception would be as generous. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PETROLEUM PRODUCTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Retail pricing)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. \n  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) whether he is satisfied that the Government has achieved its announced objective of creating a free market in petroleum products for Singapore consumers by deregulating the retail pricing of petroleum products; (b) whether the hefty price increases recently posted by the oil companies for their retail petroleum products are warranted; and (c) whether the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> oil companies have been equally prompt and faithful in their retail down pricing when crude petroleum prices fell in the past. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SINGAPORE PETROLEUM COMPANY PRIVATE LIMITED</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Propping up cartel of oil companies)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. \n  <b>Mr Chin Harn Tong</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether it is a policy of the Government that the Government-owned Singapore Petroleum Company Private Limited should help to prop up the cartel of oil companies operating in Singapore instead of seeking to enlarge its share of the retail market by more aggressive and competitive pricing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when oil prices rise, it is natural to blame a cartel. But there is no evidence that such cartel exists in Singapore now. The recent oil price increases are caused by the reduced supply of crude oil as a result of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI has closely monitored petrol prices since they were deregulated last December. Pump prices have moved in line with posted prices. Posted prices are the wholesale prices at which petrol is traded internationally. Pump prices have gone up when posted prices increased, and gone down when posted prices fell. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's domestic market for petroleum is small. Oil companies depend on the local market for only a small part of their business, less than ten percent. Their main business is international. The bulk of the oil stocks they hold are destined for overseas customers. Thus, their posted prices reflect world supply and demand for oil. They are not determined by the Singapore market. The local marketing company buys petrol from the refineries at these posted prices, like any other international buyer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Shell Singapore buys petrol wholesale from Shell Eastern, the refiner, just like Shell Hong Kong does. The only oil stocks which can be con- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sidered \"domestic\" and \"belonging to\" Singapore are the stocks held in Shell Singapore's petrol tanks on the mainland, and in the underground tanks of petrol stations. These typically last about a week of normal consumption. So, the normal lag between wholesale price changes and retail pump price changes is about a week. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not wise for the Government to ask oil refiners to \"reserve\" some of their old export stocks for the Singapore market, in order to insulate domestic customers from the effects of rising oil prices. When this becomes known, as it must, it will damage Singapore's position as an export refinery centre. The Government should maintain export neutrality, as it did during the oil shocks of 1973 and 1979. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as for Singapore Petroleum Company Private Limited, the Government does not intervene in the operations of private companies. Government-owned companies receive no special privileges, nor are they expected to act contrary to their commercial interests. In any case, Singapore Petroleum Company Pte Ltd (SPC) is not a wholly Government-owned company. DBS owns 62.6% of SPC, directly or indirectly, and, of course, the Government only owns about half of DBS. The rest of the shares of SPC belong to private investors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have dealt with both questions from the Member. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister to give this House an assurance that his Ministry will also use the same rationale on pump prices, when posted prices or international prices drop. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yes, indeed, we have been monitoring the situation, as I have said. Since December last year when we deregulated petrol prices, there have been quite a number of changes in the world oil markets and in the posted prices, and we have been tracking the retail prices. They have moved in step. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PHASING OUT RENT CONTROL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Statement by the Minister for National Development)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in October 1988, my Ministry announced that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> it would use the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act to phase out rent control. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Phase 1 of the exercise, which covered the conservation areas, 1,590 tenanted and rent-controlled properties were gazetted on 31st March 1989. Today, I would like to announce the other phases of this exercise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Phase 2 of the exercise, about 1,250 tenanted premises in the Central Area will be designated for development under the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act in September this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Phase 3, about 2,720 tenanted premises in Kallang, Geylang, Marine Parade and Bedok areas will be designated as development areas in March 1991. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Phase 4, the last Phase, about 2,260 tenanted premises in the rest of the island will be designated in December 1991. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by designating areas under the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act, owners of rent-controlled properties in such areas can recover possession of their properties if they have development plans approved by the Urban Redevelopment Authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owners and tenants can settle the matter of compensation between themselves. Where the owners and tenants are unable to reach agreement, they can turn to the Tenants' Compensation Board, which is provided for under the Act, to assess the amount of compensation that tenants, sub-tenants and occupiers are entitled to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tenants' Compensation Board is being restructured, and its membership increased, to cope with the anticipated increase in workload when more areas are designated for development. Both tenants and landlords can avail themselves of the Board's jurisdiction to expeditiously resolve compensation disputes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control of Rent Act applies to buildings completed on or before 7th September 1947. The Act was designed to protect tenants from unscrupulous landlords \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> during the housing shortage in the post-war years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions today are different. Our successful public housing programme has made the Control of Rent Act unnecessary. Because rents have been kept at nominal levels, relative to market rates, landlords have allowed their buildings to deteriorate into unsightly structures. The structures are a blight on our environment and hamper the efforts of our planners to develop a more elegant city. The Act has, in fact, virtually frozen the development of some areas in Singapore. By designating more and more areas under the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act, we can redevelop our city without any further delay. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Pock Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Pock Too (Nee Soon Central):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have three matters which I hope the Minister can clarify. First, in announcing these phases of designated rent-controlled areas for conservation development, does the Ministry have further plans to declare more new areas for conservation in each of these phases? In other words, apart from those which have already been earmarked for conservation, will there be more tenanted premises under rent control to be declared designated development areas for conservation? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if more new areas are designated for conservation development, would owners then not lose out in terms of development potential? Because better development potential can be achieved if their properties can be knocked down and rebuilt rather than redeveloped through conservation works. Conservation by itself imposes restrictions in a manner with which owners can redevelop, thereby limiting the development potential of affected areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, my GPC Members and I have frequently come across cases of dispossessed tenants and sub-tenants who are totally ignorant of their rights, who have no knowledge of the proper recourse to adequate compensation --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Ng, can I remind you that a Ministerial Statement has been made and you are to ask questions and not to make a speech. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Pock Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Pock Too:</b> I will ask my questions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You may proceed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ng Pock Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ng Pock Too:</b> --- which they are entitled to and they were totally unaware of HDB's schemes which are designed to help them seek alternative accommodation. Would the Minister ensure that standard compensation guidelines which are used to assess the amount of compensation that tenants, sub-tenants and occupiers are entitled to are made known to those who are affected? Would he also ask HDB to give more publicity to the scheme to look after those who do not have families and are dislocated by repossession of their premises for conservation development? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Dhanabalan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Dhanabalan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first point I would like to make is that this phasing out of rent control is not limited to conservation areas. In fact, Phases 2 to 4 will for the larger part be non-conservation areas. However, there will be some conservation areas in these Phases 2 to 4. In fact, the URA is now studying some new areas to be conserved and therefore these three more phases that I have mentioned will include both conservation and non-conservation areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise that conservation should not be linked with the phasing out of rent control. They are two quite separate exercises. Conservation is one of the tools of planning control in order to regulate development just like other tools that we have such as usage, density and micro zoning plans such as height that we specify for areas within the city or in some cases even outside the city. So conservation is just one type of development control tool that we have. Owners of properties, whether rent-controlled or not, are required to conform to these planning controls. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The areas that we are looking at for conservation in addition to those that have already been gazetted are as follows. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the Central Area, certain areas in Blair Plain, River Valley/Mohamed Sultan Roads and Jalan Besar are being actively looked at and if the present studies are confirmed that we should declare these areas as conservation areas, then they will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be declared very soon. Details will be released, within the next few months. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other areas for conservation have also been identified outside these areas that I have just mentioned and these will be in Joo Chiat, East Coast, Geylang and Pasir Panjang. These areas will be progressively gazetted as conservation areas before the properties are designated as development areas under the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act. In other words, by the time we designate these areas as areas ready for decontrol under the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act, the owners would know whether their particular properties are affected by conservation. In these conservation areas, owners can recover their properties for rehabilitation in the same way as they have been allowed to do under Phase 1. In such cases, \"development\" would be defined to mean renovation works as specified in URA's conservation guidelines. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of development potential in conservation areas, in the areas that we are looking at, most of the properties being considered for conservation will not be adversely affected and will not suffer any loss of development potential. In fact, initial studies show that more than 90% of the properties in the conservation areas will not suffer any development potential loss. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed conservation areas are already subject to certain development control guidelines under the Master Plan. They are, for example, height restrictions and plot ratio restrictions for the whole area. These restrictions have been applied to new building built in these conservation areas. One way of measuring the development potential would be to measure the gross floor area that an owner is allowed to build. For properties which are gazetted as conservation areas, the gross floor area in more than 90% of the cases will be no less than that allowed for new developments on vacant lots in the area. In other words, the owner of the conservation property will at the end of the day be able to get the same amount of gross floor area as a new developer next door if there happens to be a vacant lot next door. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we achieve this? This can be achieved by allowing owners to keep the front part of the old building, restore it, and building a new 3- or 5-storey development at the rear abutting the old building so that the streetscape will still be the old conserved buildings, but behind there would be a 3-or 5-storey building. This is quite often done even in other cities which have very active conservation programmes. The owner would therefore be able to achieve the same intensity of development under conservation guidelines as he would if he were allowed to demolish the old building and build a new one. Experience in Tanjong Pagar and Chinatown conservation areas also shows that buildings which are conserved appreciate more in value than similar new developments. There seems to be a premium now attached to conservation buildings. So I do not think the owners of properties in the conservation areas would lose out. First of all, they will be able to develop as much gross floor area in more than 90% of the cases, as much as somebody who puts up a new building. Secondly, under present circumstances, conserved buildings seem to command a premium over new buildings in the same area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question may still be asked, of course, why go through the bother of keeping all these old buildings. Would it not be better to knock them down and build completely new buildings? The answer really is related to the kind of city that we want. We can knock down all the old buildings and have a city of new buildings which looks like any new area in a foreign city. There will be nothing Singapore about it. There will be nothing to distinguish it from any other modern city elsewhere. We think it is better to identify critical masses of old buildings, conserve them and combine these with new developments so that the city will have a distinctive character and at the same time such old buildings will be reminders to our people of our past. It is for this reason that we think that conservation is a worth while policy to pursue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the compensation and whether we should give publicity to the compensation offered \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> under the Act. The first point to make is that measures announced so far to phase out rent control under the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act do not allow landlords to indiscriminately increase rents. They cannot increase rents. The rent controlled properties continue to be rent controlled properties even after they are gazetted. It is only after the owner has submitted plans for redevelopment and the plans are approved that he can begin to get his tenants out. If tenants feel that owners are interpreting Government's measures to their own advantage, then they should seek either legal advice or at least go and see their MP and perhaps the MP can give them some general advice and refer them to some lawyers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act only sets out the minimum compensation that has to be awarded, but there are certain criteria that are set out. The minimum, for example, for a commercial premise would be 8 years' rent. In the case of residential property, it is 6 years' rent. But in addition to this minimum, worked out on the basis of rent, the Act also specifies items which the Board has to consider in assessing compensation and the items would be items such as loss of income in the case of commercial properties, loss of goodwill, cost of removal, annual rent paid which I have already mentioned, location and siting of the premises. The Board will also take into account any other relevant matters depending on the facts of each case. So it is difficult to give clear guidelines because every case will have its own peculiar problem. Each case is therefore examined by the Board according to its own merits and I am not able to give a fixed formula that can be applied in all cases. But the criteria are fairly clear and what these criteria will do is that they will prevent tenants from being unreasonable in their demands for compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member also raised the question of old folks. Yes, there is a special scheme to assist many old single \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> persons, especially in the Central Area, who now live in rent controlled premises. What we do is we get the owners to pay four years' rent for a one-room flat in advance and then we will house these old single persons in these flats. We have had this scheme for some time but very few people have taken advantage because many of these old single persons have found their own solutions or they have gone back to live with their own families. But we will certainly give publicity to this scheme and owners who cannot remove their tenants or tenants who feel that their owners are not being reasonable can approach the URA and we will help them. But the owners have to pay the rentals in advance as part of the compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered the questions that the Member has raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(AMENDMENT NO. 3) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore\", \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Mr Goh Chok Tong); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NATIONAL REGISTRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the National Registration Act (Chapter 201 of the \n  <br>\n  <br>1985&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revised Edition)\", \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by the Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Boon Yang); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament; and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT NO. 2) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Central Provident Fund Act (Chapter 36 of the \n  <br>\n  <br>1988&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revised Edition)', \n  <br>\n  <br>presented by the Minister for Labour (Mr Lee Yock Suan); read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN WORKERS BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to repeal and re-enact with amendment the Regulation of Employment Act (Chapter 272 of the 1985 Revised Edition) and to provide for matters connected therewith\", \n  <br>\n  <br>recommendation of President signified; presented by Mr Lee Yock Suan; read the First time; to be read a Second time on the next available sitting of Parliament, and to be printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONTROLLED PREMISES (SPECIAL PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>1.30 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Dhanabalan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr S. Dhanabalan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Bill seeks to achieve two objectives. First, it seeks to streamline the procedure before an application may be submitted to the Tenants' Compensation Board. Second, it seeks to restructure and increase the membership of the Tenants' Compensation Board to handle, more expeditiously, the increasing number of applications from owners who wish to recover their rent-controlled properties in order to develop their properties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Tenants' Compensation Board (TCB) was set up under the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act. It is empowered to assess the amount of compensation tenants, sub-tenants and occupiers are entitled to. The decisions by the TCB are final and binding on both owners and occupiers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, owners are required to do two things before they may present their case to the TCB. They must first obtain approval from the Planning Authority to develop their properties. They are then required to apply to the Permanent Secretary (National Development) for approval of their plans for development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present procedure is cumbersome and inconvenient because owners have to deal with two organisations to obtain approval for their plans. The new Bill will give the Minister the power to combine the two steps. Under clause 2 of the Bill, the Minister can appoint any person, not only the Permanent Secretary (National Development), to approve the plan for development under the Act. He can therefore authorise the Planning Authority to exercise the present power of the Permanent Secretary on this matter and approve the plan for development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government announced, on 6th October 1988, its intention to phase out \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> rent control through the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act, the Urban Redevelopment Authority has received more than 300 applications from landlords to restore their rent-controlled premises. Some of these cases may eventually be heard by the TCB, ie, if the tenants and the owners cannot settle the compensation on their own. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When more areas are brought under the Controlled Premises (Special Provisions) Act, the volume of applications to the TCB is bound to increase. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present TCB will not be able to cope with the increased workload because the existing Act requires the Chairman and at least four other members to hear every case. As all who serve on the TCB do so on a part-time basis, it is difficult for them to meet often and quickly. The inability of the TCB to meet regularly could lead to a backlog of cases. Development will be held back and unsightly buildings and potentially unsafe buildings will continue to be occupied. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to enable more sittings to be convened to handle the anticipated increase in cases, one or more Deputy Chairmen will be appointed to preside in the Chairman's absence. The Deputy Chairmen will possess the qualifications of a District Judge to maintain the judicial nature of the sittings. The membership of the Board will be increased from 10 to 15. The quorum for each sitting will, however, be reduced from five to three. This therefore means that a number of committees can work at the same time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill will enable the Minister to appoint the required number of Deputy Chairmen, to increase the number of TCB members to 15, and to reduce the quorum to three. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill will allow fees and charges collected under the Act to be paid to Urban Redevelopment Authority since the Urban Redevelopment Authority will be designated as the body responsible for the administration of the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill contains consequential amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr S.

This Convention is generally known as the MARPOL Convention. The MARPOL Convention specifies measures to prevent deliberate, negligent or accidental discharge of oil or other harmful substances from ships into the marine environment. Acceptance of the MARPOL Convention will be consistent with our policy of adopting international standards for shipping and will therefore enhance the image of the Singapore flag. It will contribute towards improving the quality of the merchant fleet registered in Singapore by raising pollution prevention and safety standards. It will also help the clearance of Singapore ships in foreign ports because certificates issued to them under the Convention will be accepted by foreign authorities. Enforcing the provisions of the Convention on ships calling at our port will reduce pollution from these ships and contribute to cleaner port waters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will also repeal the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act (Cap 243) which has become largely outdated. The bulk of the provisions of the Bill are for the implementation of the MARPOL Convention. The remaining provisions cater to certain aspects of the prevention of pollution of Singapore waters which are not directly within the ambit of the MARPOL Convention and for the recovery of costs for removing pollutants. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 399</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultations, Sir, have been held with the shipping, marine, petroleum, and petrochemical industries, and their inputs have been taken into consideration in drafting the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is divided into six parts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 1 deals with the preliminary matters such as the title and the definitions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II deals with the prevention of pollution from land and from apparatus and equipment used in the transfer of oil. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III deals with the prevention of pollution from ships. This part prohibits the discharge of any oil or noxious liquid substances from Singapore ships into any part of the sea and from foreign ships into Singapore waters. The discharge of any refuse, garbage, plastic, wastes, marine pollutants and other such matters in packaged form or trade effluents from any ship into Singapore waters is also prohibited. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV empowers the Minister to direct the Port of Singapore Authority and terminal operators to provide adequate reception facilities for oil and noxious liquid substances as appropriate. It also enables the Minister to make regulations to require every Singapore ship and all ships in Singapore waters to carry an oil record book or a cargo record book as appropriate with the prescribed particulars duly recorded. Under this part, the master of a ship has a duty to report all actual or probable discharge of any harmful substance from a Singapore ship into any part of the sea or from any other ship coming into Singapore waters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V deals with the recovery of costs for removing pollutants. Under this part, the owner of a ship, the occupier of a piece of land or the person in charge of any equipment or apparatus which leads to pollution is liable for the costs of reasonable measures taken to remove the pollutants from Singapore waters discharged from that ship, place, or apparatus \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI, the final part, deals with miscellaneous matters such as the powers of inspectors, detention and arrests, evidential and procedural matters, juris- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> diction of courts and composition of offences. It empowers the Minister to make regulations to give effect to any of the provisions of the MARPOL Convention and any of its Annexes which has not been given effect in this Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the United Nations' World Commission on Environment clearly recognised the crucial role of the oceans to humanity in its 1987 Report entitled \"Our Common Future\". I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sustainable economic development, if not survival itself, depends on significant advances in the management of oceans.' \n  <br>\n  <br>Indeed, man has used the oceans as a source of food and minerals, and for other purposes such as transportation, recreation, and industry, and in some countries, as waste disposal. The oceans are therefore under tremendous pressure from all these human activities, and threats of sea pollution have become more and more. Most pollution comes from land-based sources, but a significant amount comes from shipping. It is estimated that about 12% of marine pollution results from maritime transportation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is strategically located at the cross-roads between the Asia-Pacific and the Middle-East and also Europe. Our port ranks as the world's busiest port with about 40,000 vessels calling in 1989. Singapore is also a regional refining and bunkering centre. In addition, the Malacca and Singapore Straits are very busy waterways used by international maritime traffic. In view of the high level of shipping activity, Singapore is very vulnerable to pollution from ships, both accidental and operational. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our population increases and the country becomes more affluent, there will be growing demand for recreation and greater consciousness of the need for better health and better living conditions, ie., a higher quality of life. Marine leisure activities like swimming, wind surfing, sailing, fishing, and scuba diving are increasing, not only among Singaporeans but also with tourists. Besides recreation \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and tourism, we also have a thriving aquaculture industry. All these demand that the waters around us be kept clean. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is therefore timely and will enhance our efforts to preserve the marine environment. It is also consistent with our policy of adopting international standards for shipping. The Minister has also mentioned that it will facilitate the clearance of Singapore ships in foreign ports and reduce operational and accidental pollution from all ships using Singapore waters. Pollution from land-based sources can also be effectively dealt with. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister two questions. First, what proportion of the total number of ships using Singapore waters are at present not up to the required standards and how do we deal with them in bringing the new law into force? Second, what can we do when a non-Singapore ship causes pollution just outside our waters? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Yeo Ning Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Yeo Ning Hong:</b> Sir, I thank the Member for his support. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surveys done by the Marine Department have shown that most of the ships registered in Singapore are already meeting the MARPOL Convention, because the MARPOL Convention has come into effect in 1987 and most shipowners are very conscious of the importance of preventing pollution. So many of them have already made the adjustments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bill is passed and enacted, the Ministry will arrange for the Marine Department to give advice. Indeed advice has already been given when the Bill was in the drafting stage. As I said earlier, there were extensive consultations. So I would expect that when the Bill is enacted in a few months' time, practically all, if not all, ships would have met the conditions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second question, the MARPOL Convention applies worldwide and it is maritime law that countries have jurisdiction only within their territorial waters and jurisdiction on ships registered under their country's flag. So if a ship that is registered under the Singapore flag pollutes the sea outside of Singapore's territorial \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> water, then that ship will face the appropriate punishment. But if it is a ship that is not registered with Singapore and is outside Singapore's territorial water, then the appropriate measures to be taken would be to report the incident to the state that the ship is flagged with. Of course, if the ship is in some other country's territorial waters, the report can also be made to that other state to take appropriate measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Yeo Ning Hong]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>NEWSPAPER AND PRINTING PRESSES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister of State for Communications and Information) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act to require an offshore newspaper to apply for an annually renewable permit if its circulation in Singapore is 300 copies or more per issue. An offshore newspaper is defined as a newspaper published outside Singapore at intervals not exceeding one week and contains news, intelligence, reports of occurrences, observations or comments, pertaining to the politics and current affairs of any country in South-East Asia. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is to correct an anomaly in the treatment of newspapers which are published locally and those which are published outside Singapore which have sizeable circulations in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, local newspapers, which include those which are published and printed in Malaysia, are required to apply for a newspaper permit under the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act. But, on the other hand, newspapers which are published and printed outside Singapore are circulating in Singapore without permit requirements. In recent years, some \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> foreign newspapers have built up sizeable circulations in Singapore. This rise in circulation may have given some foreign publications the impression that they have the right to circulate in Singapore. And it may also have led some of them to the assumption that they must play the same role that they play in their home markets; in other words, of being part and parcel of the political process, of taking sides and influencing events. This Bill serves to reinforce the Government's consistent position that it is a privilege, and not a right, for foreign newspapers to circulate in Singapore. They do so as foreign observers of the local scene and should not interfere in the domestic politics of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new section 15A, subsection 4, provides that the permit granted shall be for one year from the date of issue and may be renewed for further periods not exceeding 12 months. In granting the permit, the Minister can specify the maximum number of copies that the approved offshore newspapers can circulate in Singapore, and this number can be varied from time to time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the permitted maximum for foreign newspapers will be more than their existing circulation, to allow for growth. And the maximum will be reviewed when the permit is due for renewal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for foreign newspapers which engage in our domestic politics, it is likely that this maximum will be held at some fixed level for some time or even reduced, if the situation warrants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new section 15A, subsections 3(b) and (c), provides that offshore newspapers applying for a permit to circulate must undertake to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of Singapore courts, appoint a person within Singapore to accept service of any notice or legal process on behalf of the proprietor or publisher and furnish a deposit for the purposes of meeting any liability or costs arising out of legal proceedings taken against the newspaper. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new amendment will overcome problems and difficulties encountered in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the service of process on defendants. As the law now stands, the defendant who is outside jurisdiction would have to be served in that country where he has his head office and where he normally carries on business. This means that the plaintiff will have first to ask for leave from the High Court in Singapore and then after having successfully obtained an order of court, effect service on the defendant outside the jurisdiction, with all its attendant difficulties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to give one recent illustration: Lawyers acting for the Prime Minister had for more than five months been unable to serve notice of the Writ of Summons on Mr Peter Kann, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Dow Jones. The Solicitors for Dow Jones wrote to say that they had no instructions to accept service on behalf of Mr Kann. The US Department of Justice was also unsuccessful in serving the writ as the attorneys in Dow Jones Corporate Legal Department in New York refused to accept service for Mr Kann and claimed not to know his whereabouts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only after the First Deputy Prime Minister raised this with Miss Karen Elliot House of Dow Jones that the General Counsel of Dow Jones wrote to say that he had been authorised to accept service of the writ on Mr Kann's behalf. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as only offshore newspapers with sizeable circulations in Singapore will be subjected to the permit requirement, only a small number of foreign publications and newspapers will be affected by this Bill. Newspapers which are published at intervals exceeding one week and those with small circulation are not affected. The majority of international and regional publications are not affected. They will continue to have free access to the Singapore market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is not intended to curb the circulation of any publication, neither is it intended to prevent the free flow of information. Rather, it is to establish the point that foreign publications circulate in Singapore as a matter of privilege and not of right, and if they want to sell here, they must abide by our laws and must agree to come under the jurisdiction of our Courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a position which, I believe, no foreign publisher can reasonably disagree with. Asiaweek, for instance, has publicly accepted our stand, and, in the case of Dow Jones, in an exchange of letters between our First Deputy Prime Minister and Miss Karen Elliot House, Vice-President, International of Dow Jones, these points have also been acknowledged. I quote from a letter dated 31st May 1990 to the First Deputy Prime Minister: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Dow Jones &amp; Company, inc acknowledges that the Journal's activities within Singapore are a privilege granted by Singapore and not (as under the American Constitution) a right. I also repeat that we recognise that Singapore's courts have held that The Asian Wall Street Journal in 1986 engaged in the domestic politics of Singapore. We have no further rights of appeal from that decision; it is final, and we accept it as such.\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further on in the same letter, she says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"... it [in other words, The Asian Wall Street Journal] will continue to be subject to Singaporean law. We respect the countries in which we operate worldwide and their laws.\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, therefore, is a natural follow-up to reinforce the Government's position and to put in place a set of rules, so that no foreign publication circulating in Singapore has any doubts as to the conditions under which it is allowed to circulate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Hong Hai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Hong Hai (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my GPC accepts the basic objectives of the Bill that the circulation of a foreign newspaper is not a right but a privilege, that foreign newspapers should not engage in Singapore's domestic politics, and that there should be instruments to discourage foreign newspapers from so engaging in domestic politics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I am in agreement with the following measures introduced by the Bill for foreign newspapers: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To have a yearly permit to circulate in Singapore; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The newspapers should accept the jurisdiction of Singapore's courts; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Agents should be appointed by these newspapers to receive service of any notice or legal process. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would, however, like to ask the Minister to give a clearer justification for the idea of a maximum permitted circulation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under current laws, errant newspapers can be banned. If the offence is not as serious, they can be gazetted, that is, have their circulation restricted. Why is it necessary then to introduce a maximum for each newspaper regardless of whether or not it has been errant? The large majority of foreign newspapers are responsible and behave themselves. Why then apply a quota to each one of them? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we set a maximum or ceiling to a newspaper's circulation, either it has an effect or it does not. If the ceiling is above the regular circulation of the newspaper, it has no effect on the newspaper provided, of course, that the ceiling is raised regularly to accommodate increases in circulation. If, on the other hand, the ceiling is below the newspaper's normal circulation, you have effectively gazetted it. We already have legislation that empowers the Minister to gazette foreign newspapers. So, why bother with ceilings? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the answer lies in the notion that the Minister, like a surgeon, should have various instruments at his disposal to deal with a variety of situations in a more flexible way. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, if I may, suggest an analogy that perhaps will illustrate the purpose of these instruments. To ban a newspaper is equivalent to chopping a man's head off: you use a chopper for that purpose. To gazette a publication is to damage its profit through reduced circulation. It is like using a stick to punish the errant: you apply the stick where it hurts most, you go for the bottom line. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill that is now before the House places yet another instrument in the hands of the Minister. I am of two minds as to whether the instrument should be described as a carrot or as a screw. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather like a screw in that the Minister tightens the screw on those who are liable to get out of line. The greater the deviation, the tighter the screw. The more responsible and objective the newspaper \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> becomes, the more the screw will be relaxed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer to call the new instrument a carrot. Newspapers that behave with decorum and with respect for our sovereignty, and who do not dabble in our internal politics would enjoy generous ceilings. It is an incentive for engaging in fair and responsible reporting. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Bill is passed, the Minister will have a chopper, a stick and a carrot. I hope he will use these instruments sparingly. I am sure he will not subject it to abuse, as for example he would, if he lowered the ceiling for newspapers that were merely being constructively critical. It should not lead to a situation in which a publication's profitability is directly dependent on how supportive it is of Singapore Government policies. If that were to happen, it would do little for our standing as an information centre, or for our own self-esteem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as we have a Government that is honest and rules with high standards of integrity, which this Government does, the new Bill will not be subject to abuse. However, if we ever get a Government that wanted to retain power at all costs, the Bill provides an enhanced means for such a Government to exploit the press unfairly to its advantage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would, therefore, urge the Government to make it a practice to give full accounting and justification to the public whenever a newspaper's maximum permitted circulation is lowered, or when its circulation growth is being hampered. This, I hope, would help prevent the possibility of abuse and provide the public with a check on unfair play. We must not only be fair but appear to be so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these caveats, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the third amendment to the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act in recent years, since the PAP's open confrontation with the foreign press. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1986 amendment allows the Minister to arbitrarily declare and gazette a foreign publication as having engaged in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the domestic politics of Singapore (which declaration, of course, is subject to debate) and so to restrict its circulation in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Far Eastern Economic Review, the Asian Wall Street Journal, Asiaweek, have all been affected. The Far Eastern Economic Review and the Asian Wall Street Journal still have their circulations restricted, and their correspondents are also barred from reporting even international meetings in Singapore. When the FEER chose to stop its distribution in Singapore after its circulation had been arbitrarily and drastically cut from 9,000 to 400 or 500, Government brought in another amendment in 1988 to allow approved agents to photocopy the gazetted publication, FEER, with advertisements left out, for sale and distribution in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this has not much improved the situation of easy access to the Far Eastern Economic Review. Not many people know where they may obtain the photocopied weekly. And now, why this present amendment? As explained by the Minister of State, because there was difficulty in service of legal process upon the proprietors of Asian Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe, this is another knee-jerk reaction from Government, like the amendments to restrict appeals to the Privy Council in UK, after the judgement in J.B. Jeyaretnam's case. Now, the amendment Bill is intended not so much to correct any anomaly as to facilitate Government action against foreign publications in defamation suits, should it prove advantageous for Government to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various conditions are to be imposed for granting permits for the sale and distribution of offshore newspapers in Singapore. And may I say this, Sir. This immediately reminds me of the somewhat similar imposition of new rules and regulations for the application of the yearly permits for the Barisan Sosialis Party organs, the \"Zhen Xian Bao\", in Chinese, and the Plebeian, in English, 16 years ago in 1974. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The then new rules in the application for the permits made it necessary for a poli- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tical party to list in the application forms the names of not only the Editor and Publisher, but also the names of all the Central Committee Members of the Party and, together with, (this is the important part) their disposable capital, including the value of movable and immovable property owned by them. I find this last objectionable condition omitted in the most recent application forms. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat in the new rules at that time was crystal clear. In the case of the Barisan Sosialis, it was a threat of possible defamation suits against not only the Editor and Publisher, but also against all the Committee Members of the Party. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The then new rules, Sir, were of course, meant to ban the Party organs indirectly, which they did, as it was quite easy to stop the Barisan Sosialis from filing fresh applications for the yearly permits of the Party organs, one in Chinese, one in English. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how will the present amendment, and the imposition of new rules for the application of permits for the sale and distribution of offshore newspapers, affect the foreign publications now being distributed in Singapore? Many of the foreign publications have huge financial resources. They will not be that easily intimidated, like the hapless Barisan Sosialis then, and I am sure, they will easily and gladly comply with whatever new rules and regulations that may be imposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what will be the possible outcome of the open confrontation between the PAP Government and the foreign press, or rather, certain foreign publications? There is already a record of frequent post-election defamation suits against political opponents, and also of recent defamation suits against certain foreign publication. Then there were the amendments last year to restrict appeals to the Privy Council in the UK. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, whether or not we agree with the PAP's so-called cardinal principles, as pronounced by the First Deputy Prime Minister, the passing of the amendment Bill will certainly cause foreign publications which have complied with the new regulations to be extra careful in their comments on issues and events in Singa- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> pore. Of course, these foreign publications may either ignore or bypass all news about Singapore affairs or just blandly report controversial issues in Singapore without comment, like what the local press does. Either way, that would be a great loss for our people in Singapore. We would not know how other people and foreigners especially see us. We would not know what their comments are, whether they are objective or subjective or slanted, and how they compare happenings in Singapore with events in other parts of the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does all this mean? In Singapore today, Government already exercises full control over the amalgamated local press. TV and radio are Government monopolies. Professional organisations are discouraged from making comments on controversial political issues. The Law Society cannot comment on new legislations publicly unless requested by Government to do so. Only political parties may express political dissent and their views are given scant publicity, if at all, in the local press and none at all over TV and radio. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation is also being prepared to control criticism of Government policies by religious bodies, and now we have an attempt to control the foreign press in Singapore. Yes, Sir, despite the assurance given by the Minister of State, the amendment Bill is clearly intended to be yet another attempt to control the foreign press, and to restrict the free flow of information in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government will naturally gain much adverse publicity internationally for what it does now. But the real losers, I must emphasise, are the people of Singapore. Because the amendment is an attempt, in however a limited way, to shut the people of Singapore off from the world that enjoys free flow of information. Of course, we have other facilities or communication like fax, satellite TV and whatnots. But such things are not easily available to everyone. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Fax is available. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Siew-Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Siew-Choh:</b> When the circulation of foreign publications is restricted, it is no longer easily accessible. After all, not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> everyone can have the time and convenience to go to public libraries to read such gazetted publications with restricted circulation in Singapore. If the vast majority of our people are uninformed or misinformed, then the stage is set for the government which already controls the local media, to effectively influence our people's thinking on vital issues. That is how thought control is carried out in Communist countries and in fascist countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the First Deputy Prime Minister laughing. Of course, he knows it. It looks as if we in Singapore may be heading step by step towards the same type of thought control under the PAP Government. With the new PAP leadership, there is a great deal of talk about consultative democracy. But unless there is a free flow of information with no restriction whatsoever, there is no possibility of any form of democracy in Singapore. The people must first be informed and knowledgeable before they can take part in meaningful discussions and give their constructive views on important national issues. If Government should be genuine about the consultative democracy and not wish our people to be uninformed or misinformed on world and local issues, then it should seriously reconsider its intentions to push through the amendment Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the sitting and will take the Chair again at 2.45 pm. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>at 2.20 pm until 2.45 pm.</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <i>Sitting resumed at 2.45 pm</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>NEWSPAPER AND PRINTING PRESSES (AMENDMENT) BILL</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the key element of this Bill is the introduction of a permit for an offshore newspaper to circulate in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I discussed this amendment with some young professionals in Singapore, the first question they asked is whether this amendment constitutes a form of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> censorship, however subtle it may be. Mr Speaker, Sir, this misconception should be dispelled thoroughly in the course of this debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, Mr Speaker, Sir, censorship takes place when individual issues of a publication and individual articles in the issues are examined and offending paragraphs are expunged or obliterated with black ink. This amendment does not impose this on the newspapers. In my view, the new requirement for a permit makes it compulsory for an offshore newspaper to declare its intention to circulate in Singapore. Furthermore, by going through the process of an application for a permit, the offshore newspaper will gain a clear understanding of the ground rules in Singapore. By accepting the permit, the newspaper in effect accepts the ground rules that we would like to uphold in our country. These ground rules that the newspapers should observe are not some over-bearing ones. They are, to my mind, simple ones that should pose no difficulties. Clearly, there is no intention whatsoever to change the editorial policies of the newspapers concerned. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what we have observed in the past, what the Government would like to uphold is fair and accurate reporting. In particular, the Government would like the offshore newspapers to observe and be committed to the right of reply. In other words, when a newspaper publishes a critical article, the other party, be it a private person or the Government, should have the right to present his side of the story. The readers could then be the judge. To me, Sir, observing the right of reply of the other party would ensure responsibility of fair reporting by all newspapers. Of course, no one likes new restraints, least of all, foreign journalists. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are not the only society which has enough of irresponsible reporting. The British Parliament has declared its intention to introduce legislation to guarantee right of reply in newspapers. I recall reading recently a news report that the British press has been given a \"final warning\" to buckle up on this issue of irresponsible reporting and to provide the aggrieved party the right of reply, or face the consequences when \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> legislation is introduced to regulate the press in this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second litmus test I would like to apply regarding this Bill is whether foreign publications still enjoy greater privilege vis-a-vis local publications when this Bill becomes law. To me, the answer is obviously yes, and the obvious privilege is the privilege of foreign publications to carry cigarette advertisements when our own publications are banned from doing so. We all know that the greater part of the revenue of newspapers and weekly magazines comes from advertisements and cigarette advertisements form the major part. As such, I am not happy that foreign publications circulating in Singapore under the new rule can still carry such advertisements which allow them in a way to bypass our express intent as a people to curb smoking in our country. If this is not a privilege, then what is? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do have a point to seek the Minister's clarification. The premise of the original amendment to the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act is to deter foreign newspapers from engaging in domestic politics. This amendment is an extension of the original amendment. As such, I find the definition of \"offshore newspapers\" as those reporting on countries in Southeast Asia a bit too wide from this particular perspective. I can understand that to make the definition narrower to reporting purely on Singapore would be too restrictive from an administrative point of view. However, critics of this Bill could point out to this definition and claim that Singapore would like to extend its purview beyond its boundary and thereby weakening the rationale for this Bill. Perhaps the Minister can reply. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (Eunos GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to declare my interest in speaking on this Bill, as I work in the publishing and printing industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. I understand the rationale for the Bill. But I would like to ask the Minister whether the Bill would have any economic impact, directly or indirectly, on Singapore. Sir, the publishing and printing industry is one of the fastest growing industry in recent years. In terms of value added, it averaged 15% \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> growth in the last three years. The Government through EDB has been promoting Singapore as a regional publishing and printing centre. Today, Singapore is a major distribution centre for many local, regional and international journals and newspapers. Singapore is also one of the most competitive commercial printing centres in this region, competing strongly with Hong Kong, Korea and Japan. Most of the journals and newspapers which are distributed in the region are also printed in Singapore. Because of our strategic location and advanced infrastructure, many publishing and printing companies have indeed set up operations, including regional head office in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the printing and publishing industry has had its share of contribution to our economy. In 1989, there were more than 300 establishments in the industry with a total output of $1.5 billion and a value-added of over $800 million. The industry today employs more than 15,000 workers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned, Sir, as to whether the introduction of this Bill would affect Singapore's status as a regional printing and publishing centre. I know the Minister said that the impact is small as only a limited number of foreign publications would be affected by the Bill. I want to know whether the Minister or his Ministry has assessed the impact of this Bill on the Government's efforts to promote and develop the publishing and printing industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One observation often raised by critics in the industry is that although the impact of the Bill may appear small and negligible, it carries other implications. It may send a wrong signal to many a foreign publisher who may then pull out totally from Singapore. This indirect impact could be serious in the longer term, especially on our efforts to promote the Singapore publishing and printing industry which is indeed one of the niche industries identified by the Economic Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should be grateful if the Minister would give his comments on these observations and perhaps reassure us that the Bill would not affect Singapore's status as a printing and publishing centre and that the Government will remain committed to promoting the industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I welcome the proposed amendments to enable the Government to deal more effectively with the foreign press. The current situation is like allowing any stranger to freely enter your home and when he misbehaves or messes up the place you find it difficult to ask him to make good his misdeeds and the damages he has caused. Without the requirement for a permit to circulate in Singapore, the foreign press may assume that they automatically have the right of circulation here. This may lead to their believing that they also have the right to interfere in our domestic politics through their publications and behaving so either with the hope of increasing their circulation or with malicious intent. I cannot believe that those who engage in our domestic politics should feel that they are here to educate Singaporeans. If anything, they should realise that by their actions they are in fact undermining our institutions and the stability of our society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the imposition of a maximum allowable number on the circulation of foreign newspapers represents an efficient carrot and stick approach. Those publications that do not engage in our local politics should be encouraged to grow, if they can. The Minister should therefore ensure that the maximum circulation allowed for these newspapers would not at any time restrict their sales. In other words, he should be generous in granting the maximum. But for those errant newspapers the imposition of a ceiling offers us a gradation of measures instead of just banning or gazetting to make them improve their behaviour because their circulation will be affected and they would lose money. There may, however, be some who would not concede and who feel that if they can get their own governments to apply pressure on us, then we will capitulate. But they are sadly mistaken. They will find at the end that it is they, not us, who will have to capitulate because ultimately they are here to make money and this will have to be their main concern. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also happy to note that the Minister may impose other conditions to make the offshore newspapers accept the jurisdiction of Singapore courts, appoint agents in Singapore to receive service of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> any notice or legal process and furnish a security deposit to meet any liability arising out of legal action. These measures will undoubtedly induce responsible behaviour and ensure that any damage caused by those who abuse their privilege will be made good. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I thank all Members for their contribution to the debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first of all respond to the NCMP, Dr Lee, who opposes the Bill on the grounds that it curbs the free flow of information. Sir, how can anyone who has lived in Singapore over the last so many years believe that the Government can actually succeed in curbing the free flow of information? Indeed, how can anyone believe that it is in the interest of Singapore and Singaporeans to curb this free flow of information? Is it wise? We are an international business centre. We are a trading centre. We make a living out of knowing what is happening in the world, out of making sure that there is a free flow of information. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would we be celebrating 25 years of independence in the manner and in the mood that we have done this year if in the last 25 years we had curbed the free flow of information, or, worse still, if we had practised thought-control? I think if anyone wishes, he can have many, many sources of information, without having to go to too much trouble. There are 4,500 publications circulating freely in Singapore, without any curbs on their circulations. Three of them have had their circulations gazetted. But even then they are freely available in Singapore. The Far Eastern Economic Review, for example, which has declined to circulate in Singapore, is freely available. In fact, I checked with Mr Lim Boon Heng just now and he tells me that there are 33 outlets in Singapore where a copy of the Far Eastern Economic Review, without advertising, is freely available. This includes all the outlets of NTUC Fairprice. It is also available by individual subscription. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the BBC 24-hour service, 24 hours of information freely available at the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> twist of a dial. So the issue is not really whether this Bill curbs the free flow of information. I think the issue in this case is who controls the political agenda for Singapore - the Government of Singapore, or the foreign press? Who is responsible for the political agenda? Who is given the mandate to run Singapore - the Government, or the foreign press? Who is responsible for the progress and prosperity of Singapore - the Government, or the foreign press? So the conditions for the foreign press to circulate in Singapore are conditions which any reasonable publisher would be able to accept. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have there been many changes to the NPPA over the last few years? The gazetting of foreign publications came into effect primarily because the circulations of these publications have grown to the extent that, as I indicated in the Second Reading speech, their influence and their numbers have made some believe that their role and influence is similar to that in their home countries. We moved the second amendment to the Bill to allow for photocopying to give the lie to the point that this gazetting amendment is to restrict the free flow of information, which is not the case, because any Singaporean who is interested in what is being published by the FEER is free to get a copy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This third amendment is to give further substance to the Government's position that foreign publications circulate as a privilege and not as a right. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move to Dr Hong Hai's comments. I thank Dr Hong Hai for restating his acceptance and his support for the Bill. He asks in particular why we need to have a ceiling on the circulation of foreign publications. He accepts the fact that we need to have a yearly permit, that they must subject themselves to jurisdiction of the courts and appoint an agent. But he is puzzled as to why we need an extra instrument, as he puts it, over and above the availability of the chopper or the scalpel. And he suggests that the new amendment to limit the circulation of foreign publications, is to establish a ceiling for foreign publications a carrot, as an additional weapon or tool available to the surgeon. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not exactly sure in what way a surgeon uses a carrot in the course of his work. Perhaps a screw is a more appropriate analogy. I am not so familiar with what is going on in the operating theatre, but perhaps I could use another analogy, and that is, a football game. I think what we are really doing, as Dr John Chen mentioned just now, is to set the rules of the game. If you want to circulate in Singapore, follow the rules, understand and accept the rules, and then we play. If anyone infringes the rules, yellow card, first offence; second time, red card. Or if the first offence is serious enough, then red card. So there is no question asked that the decision of the referee is final. And if anyone does not like those rules, then don't play here, go somewhere else. I think that is basically the situation that we find ourselves in. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Wang is also in support of the Bill, and I thank him for that. But he asks whether this will be misconstrued as another form of censorship. I think he is quite correct in his argument that it is not a form of censorship. It is rather a means of making sure that there is fair, responsible, objective reporting. We are not talking about blanketing or blacking out criticisms. Our experience has been that even with the gazetting, foreign publications are criticising and are free to do so. But if they do so, and if we feel that their criticisms are out of order, we have the right of reply. The gazetting amendments have shown that, with it in place, our replies have been printed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether foreign publications enjoy greater privilege in Singapore - yes, I believe they do. Cigarette advertising is just one example, and many others. But this particular anomaly whereby our local newspapers are required to obtain an annual permit, and a foreign publication is not - that has been a glaring anomaly which this Bill seeks to rectify. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chew supports the Bill, but he has expressed some concern about whether this Bill would have any impact on the intention of Singapore to be a printing and publishing centre. He has also given us interesting figures. He has mentioned that the growth of this particular \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> industry over the last three years has been about 15% per annum. Over the last three years, if he recalls, we have made two amendments to the NPPA. And the fact that that has not in any way curbed or inhibited the growth of Singapore as a printing and publishing centre is fair evidence that this latest amendment will similarly not have any significant impact. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think publishers use Singapore as a printing and publishing centre because there are many direct advantages, whether it is in the efficiency of our printers, or whether it is in the efficiency of our airport and our telecommunications systems, or whether it is our courier system. I think the sum total of all these efficiencies taken together will decide whether they print here, as opposed to Hong Kong or Bangkok. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the fact that the conditions have been favourable for them over the last three years is ample testimony to the fact that our effort at making Singapore a printing and publishing centre is showing results and will continue to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last but not least, I would like to respond to Dr John Chen who has asked whether, in the setting of the maximum allowable circulation limit, we will be generous in our setting of the ceiling for those publications which do not engage in domestic politics. As I indicated in my speech earlier, it is the intention of the Ministry to make sure that when we set the ceiling, for those publications which have no cause to get involved in our domestic politics or who have not shown any inclination to do so, that ceiling will be set in a way which will allow for continued growth. But, on the other hand, where a publication has shown an inclination to do so, I think it is within the Ministry's prerogative to set a ceiling which will ensure that the rules, as they have undertaken to follow, namely, that they do not engage in our domestic politics and submit themselves to the jurisdiction of our courts and appoint an agent, are followed, and followed closely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT TO A DATE TO BE FIXED</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That at its rising today, Parliament do stand adjourned to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ON HAWKERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>3.15 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past few months, the Ministry of the Environment has suddenly conducted very stringent inspections on hawker centres. They have also issued summonses and imposed fines on hawkers, thus causing grave concern and fear among the hawkers. So on this development, I hope that the Ministry of the Environment will give a proper clarification and explanation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to state that the Government Parliamentary Committee on the Environment has always been supportive of the Government's measures to enhance food hygiene. The GPC on the Environment has also repeatedly asked for appropriate actions to be taken against those food manufacturers, restaurants and stallholders for causing food poisoning. But I feel that the recent actions of the Ministry of the Environment against the hawkers have been excessive and overdone. These controls and regulations should, therefore, be reviewed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of the Environment's objective, of course, is to enhance food hygiene. This is generally understood and supported by the people. But how to enhance the level of food hygiene is a question of the method of implementation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Therefore, it is necessary to have consultations and discussions with the hawkers concerned. Because certain measures may appear feasible, in theory, but may, in reality, have problems with implementation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an illustration, the Ministry of the Environment officials say that hawkers are not allowed to handle food with their bare hands. They should use forks and spoons, or other utensils. But the preparation of certain food, such as popiah, cannot be done without using your hands. But the Ministry of the Environment officials say that if they want to handle food with their hands, then they must wear gloves. But the officials forget about the inconvenience caused by wearing gloves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few samples of gloves here [indicating]. So you can see that some of these gloves, made of plastic, are ill-fitting. Because they are made of plastic, there is no ventilation and a lot of heat is generated inside the gloves. Some gloves are too large. So if you wear an over-sized glove and you have to cut something, it will also cut away the fingers of the glove, and these will go into the popiah. This is a real problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worse still, when they are wearing gloves and have to collect and change money, they must not forget to remove them. And if they change money with the gloves on, then it will be even more unhygienic. Even assuming that the hawker keeps on taking off and putting on the hand gloves, the gloves will become dirtier. And it is against the standard of hygiene. So this is a practical problem. Maybe the Ministry of the Environment should not insit that food handlers must wear gloves. Instead they should require that all food handlers should keep their hands clean. In other words, before they handle food, they must keep their hands clean, and they are not allowed to handle money or other things with their bare hands. Then, of course, they should not be allowed to dig their noses and ears. If they are found indulging in unhygienic practices, then should be fined. This is feasible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, another headache to the hawkers is the Ministry of the Environment's ruling \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and insistence that all cooked food must be cooked within the premises of the hawker stalls. If food is pre-prepared at home and sold at the stall, then it is illegal. But we must not forget that certain kinds of food cannot be prepared inside the stall itself, because the space within the hawker stall is too small. This is another practical problem faced by the hawkers. The Ministry of the Environment is worried that the food prepared at home may not comply with the standard of hygiene. But I would like to ask the Minister whether he has got any facts to prove that food prepared at home has failed to live up to the standard and has caused food poisoning. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint by hawkers is that the hawker inspectors, in carrying out their duties, lack flexibility. They tend to make mountains out of molehills. They are discourteous and unreasonable. I hope that the Minister for the Environment will take note of this point and should give proper directives to the hawker inspectors that, in carrying out their duties, they should not adopt the attitude of the police catching the thief. They should not resort to the method of \"ambushing\" the hawkers. If hawkers should make any mistake, it is for the hawker inspector to tell them where they have gone wrong and show them the right way of doing things, in the first instance. And if such mistake is repeated, then the inspector can summon them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have received some complaints. A fruit seller has cut some fruits and displayed the cut pieces of fruits like apples, watermelon and papayas inside the glass case at the stall. On his right hand, there was no glove because he had to hold a knife. On his left hand, he had to hold the fruit, so he wore a glove. But one of the pieces on display was out of alignment, so he used the right hand, which had no glove on, to put it right. Then the hawker inspector who was, in \"ambush\" suddenly came out from somewhere and caught him using his bare hand to touch the watermelon. And so he was summoned. I think this is too much. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hawkers feel that they cannot be blamed entirely for all the faults. For example, if rats and cockroaches are found in their stalls, then the hawkers will be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> severely penalised. But the hawkers said that these rats and cockroaches are not bred by them. Many of them come from the sewers nearby or the rubbish-heaps in the neighbourhood. But once they are found inside the stall by the hawker inspectors, then bad luck for the hawker concerned. So, now, what the hawkers fear most are the rats, cockroaches and the hawker inspectors! And if the rats, cockroaches and hawker inspectors do not visit the stall at the same time, there will be no problem. But if by coincidence all the three come together, then it is just bad luck, woe betide for the hawker. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I hope that the Ministry of the Environment will take a dialogue and educational approach with the hawkers, in order to enhance food hygiene and the hygiene of the hawker centres. I am not saying that the Ministry of the Environment is not doing this. In fact, over the past two years, the Ministry of the Environment has indeed done some educational work and taken measures to enhance hygiene in the hawker centres. This, of course, needs our commendation, and the GPC on the Environment has always been supportive of these measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I feel that education and explanation should be further enhanced and strengthened because, at the moment, there are still some hawkers who feel that they have been using the same method of operation, from one generation to another generation, without any problem whatsoever. Why should the Ministry of the Environment make mountains out of molehills and introduce so many new rules and regulations? To these hawkers, we should go through the method of education, to persuade them to change their old concept and methods, and to give up the old, bad habits. I must say that to those who have refused to listen to persuasion and education, and who do not care about public hygiene, and continue to sell unhygienic food, then apart from the educational method, the Ministry of the Environment has to take appropriate punitive measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give you a few more examples, Mr Speaker, Sir, to show that, up to now, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> there are still many hawkers who do not quite understand the rules and regulations of the Ministry of the Environment. My parliamentary colleague, Mr Chandra Das, the Chairman of the Feedback Unit, has recently conducted a dialogue session with the hawkers. One of the hawkers who attended this dialogue session asked if according to the regulations of the Ministry of the Environment, a fruit stallholder could only sell a watermelon in whole. So if a customer wants to buy only half a watermelon, can the hawker display the other half for sale? Or if somebody wants to buy half a watermelon, he must look for two customers, each wanting to buy half, so that he could sell the whole watermelon. These questions may sound ridiculous. But it reflects a problem and, that is, generally, the hawkers do not quite understand the regulations of the Ministry of the Environment. So I feel that the Ministry of the Environment should take the trouble to explain, and, if necessary, explain again to the hawkers all the rules and regulations of the Ministry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope also that the hawkers should not take an indifferent attitude, on the other hand, and deliberately contravene the rules with full knowledge. They should cooperate with the Ministry of the Environment in enhancing the standard of hygiene of hawker centres. In many hawker centres, the standard of hygiene is far from satisfactory and it has to be improved. So with a higher standard of living of the people in general, the consumers have greater demands. The hawkers should also keep pace with the change of the environment and improve their image and standard of hygiene. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chandra Das:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Goh Chee Wee has already raised most of the points I wanted to say about the feedback session which we had with the hawker associations, market committees and market representatives. All I want to inform the Minister is that they all, generally, agree and understand the need to maintain a high standard of public hygiene in hawker centres and markets. But some areas where they feel they would require some assistance, basically refer to management of hawker centres. Several hawkers felt that there was a need to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> streamline the roles of various agencies, like HDB, Town Councils, and the Ministry of the Environment, that have dealings with the hawkers. Some hawkers have come across contradictions amongst the instructions given by these agencies. They also become confused as to which is the right policy or instruction to follow. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to stress to the Minister that the hawkers generally call for more regular dialogues between the Ministry and the hawker associations and market committees. This would help to iron out many problems and foster a more conciliatory climate rather than the current confrontational relationship, well illustrated by my colleague, between the two parties. All the hawkers felt that the various policy and regulations will be better accepted by the hawkers if they were properly explained to them, rather than the current harsh approach adopted by the public health inspectors. They too should be educated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to state that generally the hawkers accept and uphold the need to maintain a high standard of public health in the hawker centres. Except for the use of disposable gloves, they have no quarrels with the various other policies adopted. What they want from the Ministry is for a more fair and reasonable attitude when its officers enforce the various policies and allow them sufficient time to adjust to the various changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to thank Mr Goh Chee Wee and Mr Chandra Das for their comments and suggestions and indeed all the other Members of this House who have on several occasions outside this Chamber discussed the subject with me, usually during lunch time at Parliament Annexe. I certainly find the feedback useful and, wherever possible, have taken them into consideration in the implementation of our policies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the points brought up by them. First, let me deal with enforcement actions taken by my Ministry's Public Health Inspectors (PHIs). Hawkers are unhappy with the enforcement actions by the PHIs and they complain that the inspectors are high-handed. Sir, I can understand their unhappiness with the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> enforcement officers whose duties are to check on them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to repeat what I have said in my reply to Mr Chiam See Tong earlier today during Question Time. But what I would like to stress is that my Ministry does not and will not tolerate any high-handedness, rudeness or display of arrogance by any officer. So to hon. Members of this House and to members of the public, hawkers included, I say this: if there is a specific complaint on any officer behaving rudely or in a high-handed manner, please let us know. The complaint will be thoroughly looked into. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards rats and cockroaches, Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all know, cockroaches and rodents are attracted to and manifest in places that are poorly maintained with lots of food scraps around. Periodic surveys on cockroach and rodent infestations in hawker centres are carried out by my Ministry. For instance, in May this year, out of 4,716 stalls in 53 hawker centres checked for cockroach infestation, only 64 stalls or 1.4% were found to be infested with cockroaches. These 64 stalls were very poorly maintained. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of rodent infestation, 10 out of 57 hawker centres surveyed were found to be infested. These centres were found to be unkempt with food remnants in the perimeter drains and in articles haphazardly stored in the common areas. In such cases, the management of the hawker centres will be asked to spruce up the place. For the information of Members, no individual stallholder has been fined for rodent infestation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> What about cockroaches? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ahmad Mattar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ahmad Mattar:</b> Cockroaches, yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the preparation of cooked food, I am afraid the request to allow hawkers to prepare food at home cannot be acceded to. In fact, there are only 48 hawkers who are still preparing their food at home. The other 7,345 hawkers are preparing food at their respective stalls. However, these 48 hawkers have been given adequate time to make the necessary adjustment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of gloves, I would like to reiterate that the use of gloves is advocated only if the hawkers cannot use other appliances such as tongs or scoops to handle ready-to-eat food. Nobody is forcing the hawkers to use gloves if they can use tongs, scoops or other suitable implements to handle ready-to-eat food. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the subject of management of hawker centres. The roles and functions of the various agencies such as the HDB, Town Councils and the Ministry of the Environment are clear and distinct. Hawker centres in HDB and Town Council estates are managed and maintained by the HDB and the Town Councils respectively. The Ministry of the Environment is the authority responsible to ensure that the public health regulations are complied with. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the need for more regular dialogue sessions between my Ministry and the hawker associations and market committees, hon. Members may be pleased to know that plans are already under way to organise them on a formal basis. In fact, a programme is being drawn up at present. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, hon. Members must also recognise that we also have a responsibility to the consumers to maintain a high standard of food hygiene in our food centres. In order to have a balanced assessment of various actions and policies taken by the Ministry regarding food hygiene, dialogue sessions with the consumers will also have to be held to obtain \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> their comments. I believe, Sir, the Consumers' Association of Singapore (CASE) has requested the Feedback Unit to conduct one such session. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for education, I would like to point out that public health education for hawkers is ongoing for many years. Numerous food hygiene campaigns have been organised at hawker centres and many information and educational brochures and materials have been distributed to the hawkers. Nevertheless, we will see if more can be done. I also wish to inform this House that on the other side of the coin, the PHIs are being trained on communicative skills and how to be tactful when dealing with members of the public, including hawkers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I know that the majority of our hawkers fully appreciate my Ministry's role in protecting the health of the population at large. I have no doubt whatsoever that they know what their responsibilities are towards the consumers who are their customers. They also know that the way to ensure clean and safe food for the public is to raise their level of hygiene standards and professionalism. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at Twenty-One\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   minutes to Four o'clock pm to a\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   date to be fixed.\n  </div>   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
