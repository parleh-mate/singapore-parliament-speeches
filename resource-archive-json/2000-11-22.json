For  markets  to\r\n\r\nwork  well  there must be free competition, not collusion  or\r\n\r\nprice fixing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the Government has been progressively\r\n\r\nliberalising sectors such as telecommunications, finance  and\r\n\r\npower.   In  the  areas where prices have traditionally  been\r\n\r\nfixed,  such  as conveyancing fees, stockbroking  commissions\r\n\r\nand interest rates for chequing accounts, we have now allowed\r\n\r\nthe  market  to  set prices.  In other words, the  Government\r\n\r\nstrongly  encourages  price competition.   For  instance,  we\r\n\r\nfacilitate parallel imports of motorcars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In promoting greater competition in our economy,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  not  taken the approach  of  implementing  an\r\n\r\numbrella competition law as in OECD countries because  it  is\r\n\r\ncomplicated  and  can reduce business flexibility.   MTI  has\r\n\r\nfound  moral  suasion  effective  when  the  occasional  case\r\n\r\noccurs.  We will, however, review the need for legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE AIRLINES AND COST OF TICKET</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Name of passenger's contact person and telephone number)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following question stood in the name of Mr Chiam See Tong -\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To ask the Minister for Communications and\r\n\r\nInformation  Technology  (a)  whether  he  will  suggest   to\r\n\r\nSingapore Airlines that every passenger be required  to  give\r\n\r\nthe  name  of the contact person and his telephone number  at\r\n\r\nthe  check-in counter before a flight departure; and (b)  why\r\n\r\ndoes  an  SIA ticket cost more than that of any other airline\r\n\r\nfor  a  Singaporean  flying  to  the  same  destination  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Question No. 2,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, SIA\r\n\r\nrelies  on the contact numbers provided by passengers at  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  booking their tickets if they have to contact  the\r\n\r\npassenger  or  the next-of-kin.  Currently,  it  is  not  the\r\n\r\nstandard  industry practice for airlines  to  take  down  the\r\n\r\nparticulars  of passengers' next-of-kin.  Singapore  Airlines\r\n\r\nwould  have to assess how to reconcile the need for essential\r\n\r\npassenger  information  without compromising  its  speed  and\r\n\r\nefficiency.   It  would also have to take  into  account  the\r\n\r\nsensitivity of some passengers who might not wish to  provide\r\n\r\npersonal  information  to the airline.   Nonetheless,  I  can\r\n\r\nconvey Mr Chiam's suggestion to SIA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question on SIA's ticket pricing, the Civil\r\n\r\nAviation  Authority of Singapore does not  intervene  in  the\r\n\r\npricing   policies  of  airlines  operating   in   Singapore.\r\n\r\nSingapore is a major international aviation hub with over  60\r\n\r\nairlines operating here.  Airlines price their tickets  based\r\n\r\non commercial considerations and consumers are free to choose\r\n\r\nthe  airlines which best suit their requirements in terms  of\r\n\r\nservices,  price, routing and flight frequencies,  etc.   The\r\n\r\nprices  of airline tickets are therefore determined by market\r\n\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Does the Minister not\r\n\r\nthink  that something is amiss when Singaporeans are made  to\r\n\r\npay  higher prices than foreigners when they buy SIA  tickets\r\n\r\nin Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, foreigners buying tickets in\r\n\r\nSingapore pay the same price as any Singaporean.   The market\r\n\r\nforces are at play.  There are many airlines operating out of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and there are many airlines flying the same routes\r\n\r\nas SIA.  So consumers should choose carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, but in the case of SIA,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans prefer to fly by SIA and they are made to pay  a\r\n\r\nhigher  price.   In  a  way, they are forced  to  take  other\r\n\r\nairlines.  Do you not think there is something wrong there?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I do not think anybody forces\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to fly on either SIA or any other  airline.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  many Singaporeans fly on non-SQ flights.  I think  the\r\n\r\nmarket  is a very open one.  As with every product and  every\r\n\r\nservice,  if  a  product or service is of a  higher  quality,\r\n\r\nnormally  a premium will be applied, and we leave it  to  the\r\n\r\nmarket to determine whether a premium is applicable.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase of airline tickets, the same mechanism applies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, that is the point. When\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  fly in other airlines, and they start  to  talk\r\n\r\nwith their fellow passengers, and they found out that we  are\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore, they would wonder, \"How come you  never  fly\r\n\r\nyour  own SIA airline?\"  What are you going to tell the other\r\n\r\nperson?

As section 15 is a  relieving  section,\r\n\r\nseveral conditions have been set for the concession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition that companies restructure and merge to\r\n\r\nobtain  greater  synergy,  achieve cost  competitiveness  and\r\n\r\ndeliver   better   products  and  services  to   increasingly\r\n\r\nsophisticated  consumers, Dr Richard Hu announced  in  Budget\r\n\r\n2000  that  the  conditions for section  15  relief  will  be\r\n\r\nrelaxed so that more companies can enjoy the tax savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Hu also announced that relief would be granted to a\r\n\r\ntransfer of assets between associated companies.  This relief\r\n\r\nwas previously not available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To effect the above changes, the Bill repeals the\r\n\r\ncurrent  section 15 and introduces a new section 15 to  allow\r\n\r\nad valorem duty relief for:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a transfer of the undertaking or shares in respect\r\n\r\nof  a  scheme  for  the  reconstruction  or  amalgamation  of\r\n\r\ncompanies; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the transfer, conveyance or assignment of any\r\n\r\nbeneficial   interest   in  any  asset   between   associated\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prevent abuse and to limit the concession to\r\n\r\ndeserving  restructuring and merger schemes, we have  imposed\r\n\r\nqualifying conditions.

It\r\n\r\nalso  incorporates  two other amendments  to  the  Goods  and\r\n\r\nServices Tax Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Change   in  tax  treatment  announced  in  the  2000  Budget Statement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have earlier in the fiscal year 2000 Budget announced\r\n\r\nthat  trustee  services  supplied  by  trustees  situated  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  that satisfy the following two conditions  can  be\r\n\r\nzero-rated.  Firstly, at least 80% of the value of the  trust\r\n\r\nproperty  is contributed by overseas settlors, and  secondly,\r\n\r\nat  least  80%  of  the beneficiaries and settlors  are  non-residents of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cardinal principle underlying the Goods and Services\r\n\r\nTax  is that it is a tax on domestic consumption of goods and\r\n\r\nservices.   Before  the  above changes  were  announced,  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of trustee services by a trustee to the  trust  is\r\n\r\nstandard-rated even if the settlors and beneficiaries of  the\r\n\r\ntrust   are   all  or  mostly  foreigners,  as  the   trustee\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the  trust is situated in Singapore.   In  such\r\n\r\ncases, there is in-principle no domestic consumption, as  the\r\n\r\nrecipients of the services are in fact the beneficiaries  and\r\n\r\nthe settlors who are foreigners.  Therefore, to put Singapore\r\n\r\ntrustees   on  a  more  competitive  footing  with   offshore\r\n\r\ntrustees,  I  have decided to zero-rate the trustee  services\r\n\r\nprovided by the local trustee for such cases.  Section 21  of\r\n\r\nthe GST Act will be amended for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Changes to the Act not arising from the 2000 Budget Statement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this amendment, the following amendments\r\n\r\nwill also be made to the GST Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 33(3) of the GST Act will be amended to specify\r\n\r\nthe  rules  to  be  used  by a local taxable  person  who  is\r\n\r\nentrusted  by his overseas clients to import and  supply  the\r\n\r\ngoods  in Singapore.  The rules will provide greater  clarity\r\n\r\nto  businesses to determine the circumstances in  which  they\r\n\r\ncan  claim the GST paid on the goods imported and to  account\r\n\r\nfor GST on any supply of such goods in Singapore, as if he is\r\n\r\nthe   person  making  the  supply.

It also incorporates  three  other\r\n\r\namendments to the Customs Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Re-definition of Customs Duty</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, our Customs Act defines customs duty as `any\r\n\r\nimport  or  excise duty imposed by or under  this  Act'.  The\r\n\r\ncommon  international practice is that  customs  duty  refers\r\n\r\nexclusively  to  tariffs  applied  on  imported   goods   for\r\n\r\nprotective  and  other  trade policy purposes.   Our  current\r\n\r\ndefinition  of customs duty may therefore cause confusion  to\r\n\r\nour trading partners since it also includes excise duty which\r\n\r\nis  applied in a non-discriminatory manner on imported  goods\r\n\r\nand  locally  manufactured  products  for  fiscal  and  other\r\n\r\ndomestic policy purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make clear to our trading partners the respective\r\n\r\npurposes  of our customs duty and excise duty, our definition\r\n\r\nof customs duty should be amended to exclude excise duty.  In\r\n\r\nthis  connection,  a  new  subsection  10(1A)  will  also  be\r\n\r\ninserted  to state clearly that excise duty shall be  imposed\r\n\r\nin  a  non-discriminatory basis regardless of  the  place  of\r\n\r\norigin  or manufacture of the goods.  For equal treatment  of\r\n\r\nimported  goods  and locally manufactured goods,  section  22\r\n\r\nwill also be amended so that the same basis of valuation will\r\n\r\nbe  applied on imported goods and locally manufactured  goods\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of levying excise duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Changes to the Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the aforementioned amendments, the\r\n\r\nfollowing amendments will also be made to the Customs Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all sellers of liquors must apply for a\r\n\r\nlicence.   A  new  subsection 71(3A)  would  be  inserted  to\r\n\r\nempower  the  Minister to exempt any person  from  having  to\r\n\r\napply  for  a  licence  for the sale of  liquors  subject  to\r\n\r\nconditions  imposed  by the Minister.   This  amendment  will\r\n\r\nallow individuals who sell small quantities of liquors to  be\r\n\r\nexempted from applying for a licence.  An example would be  a\r\n\r\nperson  who  wants to auction a few bottles of  his  personal\r\n\r\ncollection of wine through the Internet.  We have decided  to\r\n\r\ncap the sales limit at 9 litres per calendar year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 75 provides for specific duties and requirements\r\n\r\nto   be   imposed  on  persons  licensed  for  the  sale   of\r\n\r\nintoxicating liquors. This section will be repealed. The  new\r\n\r\nsection   75  will  enable  the  Minister  to  prescribe   by\r\n\r\nregulations  certain  duties  and  requirements  of   persons\r\n\r\nlicensed  to sell liquors.  This will give us the flexibility\r\n\r\nto  revise  those  duties and requirements to  keep  up  with\r\n\r\nchanging circumstances without having to amend the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, a new section 90E will be inserted to require\r\n\r\nevery  importer and exporter of dutiable goods and his agents\r\n\r\nto retain specified documents relating to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  goods  for not less than seven years.

Over  the years, we had gradually liberalised  the\r\n\r\nCPF  rules to allow members to use savings in their  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount  to  purchase homes, invest in shares, buy  insurance\r\n\r\npolicies, unit trusts, or even place in fixed deposits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOnly   the  savings  in  the  Special  Account  had  remained\r\n\r\nuntouched.  Why?  Because the Special Account was seen  as  a\r\n\r\nmember's  cash  savings  for  his  retirement.   The  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  complements  the Minimum Sum  Scheme.   This  is  so\r\n\r\nbecause, for most of the CPF members, the cash needed  to  be\r\n\r\nset  aside  for the Minimum Sum would come largely  from  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account savings.  Most members by age 55 would  have\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  a  large part of the Ordinary Account  savings  to\r\n\r\nfinance  the  purchase of their homes.   Hence,  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount would provide most of the cash savings for their old-age needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1999, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on\r\n\r\nAgeing Population recommended that Special Account savings in\r\n\r\nexcess  of  the  Minimum Sum be allowed  for  investments  in\r\n\r\nretirement-related instruments.  The Committee concluded that\r\n\r\nthere  are in existence today adequate avenues for  low  risk\r\n\r\nlong-term  investments which can help CPF members to  enhance\r\n\r\ntheir  old-age  cash savings.  The Government  accepted  this\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to give CPF members the opportunity  to  earn\r\n\r\nhigher returns on their retirement savings.  On closer study,\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  concluded  that by  restricting  the  class  of\r\n\r\nretirement-related instruments, we did not even  require  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers to lock up the Minimum Sum.  In other words,  it  was\r\n\r\npossible  to  allow members to invest all  of  their  Special\r\n\r\nAccount savings in such a retirement-related instrument.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the basic principle that the Special Account\r\n\r\nsavings should not be exposed to high investment risk remains\r\n\r\nvalid.   Hence, such investment should not go  to  high  risk\r\n\r\nhigh  return  speculative instruments.  We  have  to  make  a\r\n\r\nrisk/return  trade-off and balance the goal of  enabling  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  to  earn higher returns against the  fact  that  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account savings represent the basic safety  net  for\r\n\r\nmany  Singaporeans.   The advantage of allowing  all  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  funds,  including  the  Minimum  Sum,  for  approved\r\n\r\ninvestments  is  to encourage our citizens  to  take  greater\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  their  old  age  security  and  to  take\r\n\r\nfinancial planning more seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to reduce the exposure of Special Account savings\r\n\r\nto  investment  risk,  only lower-risk instruments  would  be\r\n\r\nallowed.  Products that are suitable for investment using the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account  savings  include long-term  bank  deposits;\r\n\r\ndeferred  annuities; endowment insurance policies;  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment/statutory board and other bonds guaranteed by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment;  and  selected unit trusts and  investment-linked\r\n\r\ninsurance policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of approved unit trusts and investment-linked\r\n\r\ninsurance policies will be based on the lowest three tiers of\r\n\r\nthe   Risk  Classification  System  adopted  under  the   CPF\r\n\r\nInvestment Scheme.  These comprise mainly money market, fixed\r\n\r\nincome  and  balanced  funds.  Higher risk  unit  trusts  and\r\n\r\ninvestment-linked policies, comprising funds wholly or mainly\r\n\r\ninvested  in equities, will not be allowed under the  scheme.\r\n\r\nCPF  members  are  also not allowed to invest  their  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  savings in individual stocks and gold.  This  is  to\r\n\r\nprevent  their Special Account savings from being exposed  to\r\n\r\nunhedged risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the CPF Act currently does not have any\r\n\r\nprovision to allow the withdrawal of Special Account  savings\r\n\r\nfor investment, clause 4 of the Bill amends section 13(1)  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  to  allow  moneys from the Special  Account  to  be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn  for  approved investments under  existing  section\r\n\r\n77(1)(m).   This will give CPF members wider access  to  more\r\n\r\ninvestment  options.   However, as with any  investment,  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  would have to exercise careful judgement and  decide\r\n\r\nfor  themselves  the level of risk that they are  willing  to\r\n\r\ntake  in their investment decision.  If they take a long-term\r\n\r\nview  and  exercise prudence in their investments,  they  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to  enhance  their old-age  savings  to  better  meet\r\n\r\nretirement  needs.  But if CPF members do not  wish  to  risk\r\n\r\ninvesting their CPF savings, they can keep their savings with\r\n\r\nthe CPF Board which provides a guaranteed minimum return of 2\r\n\r\n1/2%  for savings in the Ordinary Account and 4% for  savings\r\n\r\nin the Special Account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now touch on the amendments affecting the\r\n\r\nBudget 2000 measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCurrently, under the Minimum Sum Scheme, a member  may,  upon\r\n\r\nreaching  age 55, leave his Minimum Sum with the  CPF  Board,\r\n\r\ndeposit  it with an approved bank or use it to buy an annuity\r\n\r\nfrom  an  insurance company.  CPF savings in  excess  of  the\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum can be withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage more prudent financial planning with CPF\r\n\r\nsavings,  Finance  Minister announced in  the  FY2000  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement that the current tax exemption for annuities bought\r\n\r\nwith  the  Minimum Sum would be extended to annuities  bought\r\n\r\nwith  CPF  savings  beyond the Minimum  Sum.   The  same  tax\r\n\r\ntreatment  would be accorded to interest income arising  from\r\n\r\nCPF  savings  beyond the Minimum Sum deposited with  approved\r\n\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill introduces a new section 15B to\r\n\r\nprovide  that  a member who is entitled to withdraw  his  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  may  set aside, in addition to the Minimum  Sum,  an\r\n\r\nadditional sum and deposit it with any approved bank  or  use\r\n\r\nit  to buy any approved annuity.  CPF members will enjoy  tax\r\n\r\nexemption on the monthly withdrawals from this additional sum\r\n\r\nset aside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Finance Minister's FY2000 Budget Statement, he had\r\n\r\nalso  announced  that  the tax relief for  cash  top-ups  for\r\n\r\nparents  under  the Minimum Sum Topping-Up  Scheme  would  be\r\n\r\nextended  to grandparents with effect from Year of Assessment\r\n\r\n2001.   Clause 7 amends section 18 of the CPF Act  to  extend\r\n\r\nthe Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme to grandparents.  This will\r\n\r\nhelp  to  strengthen the multi-generational family bonds  and\r\n\r\nreinforce  the Asian tradition of looking after  our  parents\r\n\r\nand  grandparents in their old age.  Clause 9 amends  section\r\n\r\n19 to provide for the monies paid to a member's grandparents'\r\n\r\nretirement  account  shall, on the  grandparents'  death,  be\r\n\r\nreturned to the account of the member who made the payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will now touch on the CPF Home\r\n\r\nProtection  Insurance  Scheme and the Dependant's  Protection\r\n\r\nInsurance Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Home Protection Insurance Scheme was introduced\r\n\r\nto  protect CPF members and their families from losing  their\r\n\r\nHDB  flats  should  the  insured die  or  become  permanently\r\n\r\nincapacitated before their housing loans are  paid  up.   The\r\n\r\nDependant's  Protection Insurance Scheme aims to provide  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers and their dependants with financial assistance in the\r\n\r\nevent that the insured member becomes permanently disabled or\r\n\r\ndie prematurely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under both insurance schemes, claims are not\r\n\r\npayable  if  the  death or permanent injury  of  the  insured\r\n\r\nmember  arising from deliberate self-injury occurs  within  1\r\n\r\nyear from the date that he is insured under the schemes.  The\r\n\r\n1-year  time  bar  is imposed to prevent abuse  where  a  CPF\r\n\r\nmember  may intentionally join the schemes before he attempts\r\n\r\nto  commit  suicide.   This  policy  is  valid  and  will  be\r\n\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are cases where the act of suicide is\r\n\r\ncommitted  within  the 1-year period but  the  death  happens\r\n\r\nafter  the  period.   Claims for such  cases  should  not  be\r\n\r\naccepted, as the intention to inflict self-injury within  the\r\n\r\ntime bar has been made clear.  Similarly, the 1-year time bar\r\n\r\nwould  apply  in  cases where the insured member's  death  or\r\n\r\npermanent  incapacity was the result of his  own  intentional\r\n\r\ncriminal  act.   In such cases, the CPF Board  shall  not  be\r\n\r\nrequired to pay the insurance claims if the criminal  act  is\r\n\r\ncommitted  within  1 year from the date that  he  is  insured\r\n\r\nunder  the  scheme(s).  Clauses 14 and 16 of the  Bill  amend\r\n\r\nsections 36(5) and 49(4) of the Act to provide for the above.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me qualify what I mean by intentional criminal act.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  referring to minor offences or acts of negligence\r\n\r\nsuch  as  some offences committed while driving a  car  which\r\n\r\ncould,  in  fact,  result in the offender's  injury  or  even\r\n\r\ndeath.   In  such  cases, the CPF Board has been  paying  the\r\n\r\nclaims and they will continue to do so.  Intentional criminal\r\n\r\nact in this context\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeans a premeditated act, which any citizen would know,  will\r\n\r\ndraw serious penalties such as drug trafficking, gang robbery\r\n\r\nand murder.  For example, if a member was involved in robbing\r\n\r\na  bank  and was shot dead in the exchange of fire  with  the\r\n\r\npolice,  the  1-year  time  bar  will  apply.   Or,   if   he\r\n\r\nparticipated  in gang robbery and murdered a  victim  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  the  robbery and was subsequently  convicted  and\r\n\r\nexecuted,  the 1-year time bar will also apply.  Likewise  if\r\n\r\nhe  was convicted of a drug trafficking offence and executed,\r\n\r\nthe 1-year time bar will also apply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to clause 10 which amends section 29\r\n\r\nto enable the Minister to prescribe conditions for members to\r\n\r\nbe exempted from taking the Home Protection Insurance Scheme.\r\n\r\nThe  need  for  this arose from the Board's experience  of  a\r\n\r\nsharp  increase  in  the number of cases  applying  for  such\r\n\r\nexemption on account of their private insurance coverage.  In\r\n\r\nother words, there are CPF members who buy a HDB flat and say\r\n\r\nthat  they already have an existing private insurance  policy\r\n\r\nwhich  will  ensure that they can pay up their  mortgage  and\r\n\r\nthey  ask for an exemption, and such exemption is then given.\r\n\r\nThere is a real concern that some members may not be able  to\r\n\r\nservice  their private insurance policies for  a  variety  of\r\n\r\nreasons, maybe as a result of retrenchment, loss of  job,  or\r\n\r\nsome  other  financial difficulties.  It could easily  happen\r\n\r\nthat they would then let the policy to lapse.  The result  is\r\n\r\nthat   the  member's  dependants  would  then  be  completely\r\n\r\nunprotected  in  the  event of untimely  death  or  permanent\r\n\r\nincapacity  of  the  member.   Hence,  while  exemption  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be allowed, there should be some conditions so as\r\n\r\nto require the member to resume the Home Protection Insurance\r\n\r\nScheme  once  he  has allowed the private  insurance  or  the\r\n\r\npersonal  insurance policy that he has to lapse.   This  will\r\n\r\nensure  that the family will continue to be protected and  do\r\n\r\nnot lose a home due to an unfortunate event.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, there is an upper age limit for Home\r\n\r\nProtection Insurance Scheme.  Clause 10 of the Bill will also\r\n\r\nextend the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nage  limit of such a coverage from 60 to 65 years.  This will\r\n\r\nprovide  older members who are still servicing their mortgage\r\n\r\nloans  five  extra  years  of coverage  and  protection.   In\r\n\r\nparticular, those who have upgraded to bigger HDB flats later\r\n\r\nin  life, will now enjoy the Home Protection Insurance Scheme\r\n\r\nprotection for a longer period.  Clause 11 amends section  30\r\n\r\nto  clarify  that the Home Protection Insurance  Scheme  will\r\n\r\nprovide cover for only one property at any one time.   Clause\r\n\r\n12  amends  section 32 to give priority to the  deduction  of\r\n\r\npremiums over other deductions.  It also enables the Board to\r\n\r\ndecide  how  a  member is to make-up for  any  shortfalls  in\r\n\r\npremium  payment and allow joint owners of the  property  who\r\n\r\nare  husband and wife, to pay for each other's share  of  the\r\n\r\npremium.   Clause 13 repeals sections 34 and 35 which  relate\r\n\r\nto  when premiums under the Home Protection Insurance  Scheme\r\n\r\nand  Dependants Protection Insurance Scheme are due, and  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of  cover  for the Home Protection Insurance  Scheme.\r\n\r\nClause  14  clarifies  that the Board's  payment  under  Home\r\n\r\nProtection  Insurance Scheme shall be in  proportion  to  the\r\n\r\nmember's liability for the repayment of the housing loan.  It\r\n\r\nalso  clarifies the Board's payment under different scenarios\r\n\r\nof  incapacity  or  death  of the member.  Clause  15  amends\r\n\r\nsection  39 to enable the Minister to prescribe the  mode  of\r\n\r\nHome  Protection Insurance Scheme premium payment.  This will\r\n\r\nreplace the repealed sections 34 and 35, and pave the way for\r\n\r\nthe  CPF Board to allow premium payments by instalments under\r\n\r\nthe scheme in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill also introduces other amendments to meet\r\n\r\nthe administrative and operational needs of the CPF Board and\r\n\r\nto better serve members' needs.  These include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Clause 2 to amend the definition of \"wages\" in\r\n\r\nsection  2  so  as to enable the Minister to  exempt  certain\r\n\r\npayments  from  being  included  for  the  purpose   of   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.  This is not intended to change the  basis  for\r\n\r\ncalculating CPF contribution which will continue to be  based\r\n\r\non remuneration in money, including any bonus, due or granted\r\n\r\nto a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperson   in   respect  of  his  employment.   The   exemption\r\n\r\nintroduced  by  this  amendment  is  directed  at  occasional\r\n\r\npayments,  such  as \"long service awards\".  Such  awards  are\r\n\r\ngiven by employers to reward employees for their loyalty, for\r\n\r\nhaving  remained with the company for long periods  of  time.\r\n\r\nWe  see no need for such awards to attract CPF contributions.\r\n\r\nIn  exempting such \"long service awards\", we will  spell  out\r\n\r\nconditions to safeguard employees' interest;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Clause 3 to empower the Minister to appoint a\r\n\r\ntemporary   Chairman  during  the  temporary  incapacity   or\r\n\r\ntemporary  absence of the Chairman, and empower the  Chairman\r\n\r\nto  authorize any members of the Board to exercise any  power\r\n\r\nor perform any function conferred on the Chairman by or under\r\n\r\nthe CPF Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Clause 5 will allow CPF members to pledge their\r\n\r\nproperties in lieu of part of the Minimum Sum if they  co-own\r\n\r\nthe  properties  with their immediate family  members.   This\r\n\r\nwill  enable  such members to meet part of  the  Minimum  Sum\r\n\r\nrequirement by such pledges and enable them to withdraw  some\r\n\r\ncash at age 55 from their CPF account;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Clause 18 will allow the court to order the\r\n\r\nrecovery  of  CPF  arrears, in addition to  the  fine  and/or\r\n\r\nimprisonment  under section 7(3) of the Act; and  to  recover\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  arrears in the same manner as a judgement in  civil\r\n\r\nproceedings.  This will enable the CPF Board to help  members\r\n\r\nto recover the arrears more expeditiously; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Clause 19 will allow members who are legal owners\r\n\r\nof a piece of land or a property by way of inheritance to use\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF savings for the construction of properties on  the\r\n\r\nland and the servicing of outstanding housing loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the amendments proposed in this Bill will\r\n\r\nallow CPF members to invest their Special Account savings  to\r\n\r\nenhance   their  old  age  savings  and  enjoy  tax  benefits\r\n\r\nannounced  by  the  Finance Minister  in  the  FY2000  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement.  It will ensure that the provisions of the CPF Act\r\n\r\ncontinue to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrelevant  and in line with the objectives of the CPF  system.\r\n\r\nLast  but not least, it will safeguard members' interests  by\r\n\r\nextending  the Home Protection Insurance Scheme cover  to  65\r\n\r\nyears  of age and ensure that the employer's arrears  can  be\r\n\r\nrecovered more expeditiously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill moved by the Minister for Manpower and would\r\n\r\njust like to comment briefly on several clauses in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 4 of the Bill proposes to amend section 13\r\n\r\nof  the CPF Act to enable CPF members to withdraw funds  from\r\n\r\ntheir  Special  Account  for approved  low-risk  investments.\r\n\r\nThis  amendment will provide CPF members greater  flexibility\r\n\r\nto manage their own funds and, hopefully, maximise returns on\r\n\r\nthe  investments.   However, CPF members should  be  reminded\r\n\r\nthat  money in the Special Account is risk-free and tax-free,\r\n\r\nand  currently  attracts an interest rate of  1.5  percentage\r\n\r\npoints  more  than  the  interest rate  for  savings  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account.  This means a minimum of 4%  interest  per\r\n\r\nannum, which is higher than most fixed deposit rates and some\r\n\r\nlow-risk investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may not be practical for the Government to\r\n\r\nlegislate  all  the safeguards on CPF investments  such  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  a  100% protection for  investors  from  the\r\n\r\nconsequences  of their own investment actions.  However,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower  and the CPF  Board  should,  wherever\r\n\r\npossible, provide sufficient warning to CPF members that  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of investments carry some degree of risk  and  that\r\n\r\nmembers should seek professional advice if they are in doubt.\r\n\r\nFor  those who are not savvy in investment strategies, it may\r\n\r\nwell  be worth their while to keep their money in the Special\r\n\r\nAccount for the low risk and the respectable interest rate it\r\n\r\ncurrently attracts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill proposes to amend section 18 of the\r\n\r\nCPF  Act to enable CPF account holders to transfer funds into\r\n\r\ntheir grandparents' retirement accounts, in addition to their\r\n\r\nparents' and spouse's retirement accounts.  This is a welcome\r\n\r\namendment  that  will  provide  some  financial  relief   for\r\n\r\nfamilies  who  support their grandparents.   Hopefully,  this\r\n\r\namendment  will  also  create an additional  opportunity  for\r\n\r\npeople  to  financially  assist their aged  grandparents  and\r\n\r\npromote stronger bonds within the extended family unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the proposed amendment to section 29 of\r\n\r\nthe Act that will raise the age limit for the Home Protection\r\n\r\nInsurance Scheme from 60 to 65 years of age, which is in line\r\n\r\nwith  the  rising  life expectancy and  health  standards  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, and the extension of the age limit for granting\r\n\r\nHDB loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, clause 14 of the Bill will exclude claims made\r\n\r\nunder  the  Home Protection Insurance Scheme and  Dependant's\r\n\r\nProtection   Insurance  Scheme  should  death  or   permanent\r\n\r\ndisability of the insured arise directly or indirectly out of\r\n\r\nsuicide,  a  deliberate act of self-injury or an  intentional\r\n\r\ncriminal  act within one year of the date of the commencement\r\n\r\nof  the  policy.   In  addition to these exclusions,  capital\r\n\r\npunishment of any criminal act committed within one year from\r\n\r\nthe date of the start of the policy also voids any claim.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am able to understand and support the rationale\r\n\r\nfor such exclusions but would be more comfortable if there is\r\n\r\nalso  a  provision in the Bill that empowers the Minister  to\r\n\r\ngrant  exemptions should the circumstances of a case  warrant\r\n\r\nsuch an exemption.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, clause 18 of the Bill\r\n\r\nreceives  my  strong  support.  This  clause,  amongst  other\r\n\r\nthings, will empower the CPF Board to recover money owed  for\r\n\r\nCPF  contributions from errant employers who fail to pay  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  the  employees.  The  current  legislation\r\n\r\nprovides  a  fine and/or a jail term but does  not  have  any\r\n\r\nprovision to enable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecovery  of  money owed for CPF contributions. The  proposed\r\n\r\nnew section 61A of the Bill will address this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With those comments, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the CPF (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill, there is one clause which allows members\r\n\r\nto  top-up  the CPF account of their grandparents  for  their\r\n\r\nretirement  benefits. This is a move in the right  direction.\r\n\r\nThis  will  enable  our senior citizens to be  provided  with\r\n\r\nadequate  savings for their old age.  There is another  point\r\n\r\nthat  merits our attention in that there is no age  limit  to\r\n\r\nthe topping-up arrangement. In other words, the grandchildren\r\n\r\nwill  be able to transfer their CPF money into the retirement\r\n\r\naccount  of their grandparents, with no age limit.   However,\r\n\r\nin  the  present Act, children are allowed to transfer  their\r\n\r\nCPF  money  into their parents' account up to  age  65  years\r\n\r\nonly. There is a time limit and an age limit.  There seems to\r\n\r\nbe  some  contradiction here.  Let me give you an example  to\r\n\r\nillustrate my point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Mr A is now 70 years old. He was married\r\n\r\nat  the age of 20, and his son, Mr B,  is now about 50  years\r\n\r\nold.  Mr B was married at the age of 25,  and his son, Mr  C,\r\n\r\nis now 25 years old.  Now, Mr C can transfer his CPF money to\r\n\r\nthe  account of his grandfather, and can also put money  into\r\n\r\nMr  B's  account.  However,  Mr B who is the  son  of  Mr  A,\r\n\r\ncannot  put  his CPF money into the father's account  because\r\n\r\nthe latter is past 65 years of age.  There seems to be double\r\n\r\nstandards.   So  I  hope the Minister will consider  allowing\r\n\r\nthe  son  to  put  his CPF  money into the parents'  account.\r\n\r\nThere should not be any age limit.  In this way, the benefits\r\n\r\nwill  be  more consistent.  In the old days, there were  many\r\n\r\nchildren  in  the  family, for example, I  have  8  siblings.\r\n\r\nNow,  with  the small family concept, there are only  two  or\r\n\r\nthree  children, or just one child, to maintain the  parents.\r\n\r\nSo if the law can be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconsistent without any age limit for parents or grandparents,\r\n\r\nthe children and grandchildren together will be able to share\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  looking after the retirement  needs  of  their\r\n\r\nelders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I want to say\r\n\r\nthat this amendment to the CPF Act is very positive and is in\r\n\r\nharmony  with  the  recommendations of the  Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  on Ageing Population. The Committee had  expressed\r\n\r\nsome  concerns that CPF holders may not have adequate balance\r\n\r\nto  see  them  through retirement and some of these  measures\r\n\r\nseem to meet those concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly happy about some of the amendments and\r\n\r\none  of  it  is that it is actually very pro-family,  in  the\r\n\r\nsense that the definition of a related person in the Act  has\r\n\r\nbeen  amended  from  just  spouse  to  include  grandparents,\r\n\r\ngrandchildren and siblings.  This a positive move. And  there\r\n\r\nare  also incentives for grandchildren to contribute  to  the\r\n\r\ngrandparents' retirement account.  This is also a  good  move\r\n\r\nas it strengthens the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support the increase of the Minimum Sum from\r\n\r\n$40,000  to $65,000, as well as the improvements in the  Home\r\n\r\nProtection  Insurance  Scheme and the Dependants'  Protection\r\n\r\nInsurance Scheme. And very important for us are the  enhanced\r\n\r\npowers to recover arrears from defaulters.  Mr Charles  Chong\r\n\r\nhad spoken on it and I fully endorse what he said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In expressing my satisfaction, I also have to express\r\n\r\nsome concerns and suggestions that I have.  Section 2 of  the\r\n\r\nAct,  which  is going to be amended, is to give the  Minister\r\n\r\npowers  to  exclude certain payments from the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"wages\".   The Minister has clarified that he meant  payments\r\n\r\nlike long service awards.  Excluding long service awards is a\r\n\r\ngood thing and I support it. I also want to say that payments\r\n\r\nwhich are exempted from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCPF should also not be taxable.  I hope that the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance would take the cue and not tax on long service awards\r\n\r\nand one-off incentive payments which employers give.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I also want to express a bit of\r\n\r\nconcern  which workers have.  How far would the Minister  use\r\n\r\nhis  powers in granting exclusions and exemptions?   We  know\r\n\r\nthat  whenever there is financial difficulty, employers  will\r\n\r\nscrimp on cost and there is also some concern on whether this\r\n\r\nprovision  will be used to increase the amount of exemptions,\r\n\r\nresulting in lower CPF contributions in the long run.  I hope\r\n\r\nthat  this  provision will, in the long  run,  be  used  very\r\n\r\ndiscreetly  and  sparingly, with  the  workers'  interest  at\r\n\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of increasing the Minimum Sum from\r\n\r\n$40,000   to   $65,000,  it  is  positive   and   meets   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on  Ageing\r\n\r\nPopulation.  But the question is how many of our CPF  holders\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to meet this Minimum Sum.  The other  question\r\n\r\nis:   can retirees live adequately on this sum?  We know that\r\n\r\nCPF  will not fully replace earnings, so the Ministry and the\r\n\r\nCPF  Board  should  also  come out with  more  education,  in\r\n\r\naddition to what they are doing now, to tell people how  much\r\n\r\nthey  need  to  have in order to maintain the same  lifestyle\r\n\r\ncomfortably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If CPF is extremely important, then the question is:\r\n\r\nCPF  has  been  cut at least two times during  the  recession\r\n\r\nperiod, and now that the economy is doing well, when  is  the\r\n\r\nrate  going  to  be  restored?  Can it  be  restored  quickly\r\n\r\nenough?  Cutting CPF is painful and workers suffer. The  same\r\n\r\npeople  who  need the protection of CPF have  suffered  most.\r\n\r\nParallel  to  enhancing the safety net for CPF, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nmust  also  tell  us what is the progress in  developing  the\r\n\r\nflexible  wage system and how much of push is there  so  that\r\n\r\nthe workers' interest is fully protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to say that CPF only covers wage earners.\r\n\r\nIt does not cover those who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  not  wage earners.  But even for these non-wage earners,\r\n\r\nthe  contingent workforce is going up.  The number  is  going\r\n\r\nup.  We  are also encouraging people to be entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\nself-employed, and these people are not covered.  At present,\r\n\r\nthere  is provision for some of these self-employed who  have\r\n\r\napplied   for  licences  to  contribute  to  Medisave.    Can\r\n\r\nprovision  be made for more people to be covered by  the  CPF\r\n\r\nand  at  least be part of the social safety net  that  is  in\r\n\r\nplace?   I  also  observe that there will  be  amendments  to\r\n\r\nsection 39 which talks about different classes of members.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask what is being meant by \"different classes\"?\r\n\r\nWill  there be different types of schemes for different types\r\n\r\nof employees?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, just a suggestion for the Government to take\r\n\r\nup, that is, to enable people to have more money in CPF.   At\r\n\r\nthe   present  moment  and  also  in  support  of  pro-family\r\n\r\npolicies,  a  lot  of  people use CPF  to  buy  their  homes.\r\n\r\nHowever, our national servicemen do not contribute to CPF. So\r\n\r\nmaybe,  at this time, we can also make provision to  increase\r\n\r\nthe national servicemen's allowance from the present $240  to\r\n\r\nmarket rate, ie, whatever an 18 or 19-year old boy would have\r\n\r\nearned outside, and put the additional amount into CPF.  When\r\n\r\nthey complete their national service, they have some money in\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF account to pay the deposit for a home and start  a\r\n\r\nnew family very soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I would like to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, in principle, I support the CPF  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  introduced  by  the Minister for  Manpower  to  further\r\n\r\nimprove  on the implementation of the CPF system in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  to enable every Singaporean to have adequate savings for\r\n\r\nuse in their old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, after years of implementation and\r\n\r\nwith the continuous review and fine-tuning by the Government,\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  system  in Singapore is sound  and has  contributed\r\n\r\ngreatly to the economic development of Singapore.  It is  now\r\n\r\na model of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  national  policy.  It is also a very important  national\r\n\r\npolicy that the policymakers from other countries would  like\r\n\r\nto learn and emulate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the perspective of nation-building, the CPF system\r\n\r\nis  not  only  a  compulsory national  savings  scheme.   Its\r\n\r\ngreatest  effect is that it has laid a very solid  foundation\r\n\r\nin our labour-management cooperation and relationship.  Prior\r\n\r\nto  the  financial  crisis,  the CPF  contribution  rate  for\r\n\r\nemployers  and  employees was 20% on each side,  totalling  a\r\n\r\nhigh  of  40% of the employee's salary. This compulsory  high\r\n\r\nsavings  rate  is a rarity in the world and it  is  something\r\n\r\nwhich  other  countries will find difficult  to  follow.   If\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  strong support from labour and management,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be extremely difficult for the Government to implement\r\n\r\nthe CPF system in Singapore. Therefore, the Government should\r\n\r\ntreasure   this   spirit  and  strengthen   this   tripartite\r\n\r\nrelationship among labour, management and Government. So when\r\n\r\nadjusting the CPF contribution rates and formulating  related\r\n\r\nregulations, the Government should be prudent and careful not\r\n\r\nto  ignore  the  interest and feelings of the  employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees.  Otherwise,  it will lead  to  some  very  serious\r\n\r\nconsequences resulting in mutual distrust among the parties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the employers, CPF is a very heavy monthly\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  The quantum of the CPF contribution  rate  will\r\n\r\naffect their short-term and long-term business cost.  To most\r\n\r\nemployers, the 20% contribution rate is too high and  is  not\r\n\r\nconducive   to  the  maintenance  of  Singapore's   long-term\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  Therefore, when the Government reduced  the\r\n\r\nCPF  rate  to  10% during the financial crisis, the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity  was very grateful.  However, with the Government's\r\n\r\neagerness  to raise it back to 16% by January next year,  the\r\n\r\nfeeling of gratitude has faded.  In fact, many employers  are\r\n\r\nnot  comfortable with the signal sent out by  the  Government\r\n\r\nand  the labour side that they want the employers to not only\r\n\r\nraise  the  salaries of the workers to reward  them  for  the\r\n\r\nsacrifices  made during the crisis, but also to  restore  the\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution  rate  to 20% as soon  as  possible.   Many\r\n\r\nbusinesses are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhaving  difficulty  coping with such pressure  of  escalating\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost.   On top of that, the Government  is  rapidly\r\n\r\nraising taxes, rents and utility charges, and many businesses\r\n\r\nare  beginning to doubt the Singapore Government's  so-called\r\n\r\n\"pro-business\" strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from information released by MTI, our economy has\r\n\r\nrecovered,  and this year's growth rate can  be  as  high  as\r\n\r\n9.5%.   However, to most businesses, particularly  the  SMEs,\r\n\r\nthey have not completely got out from the financial hardship.\r\n\r\nMany  of  them are still having difficulties coping with  the\r\n\r\nvarious  business cost increases.  Apart from  a  handful  of\r\n\r\nlarge enterprises in the electronic, chemical engineering and\r\n\r\nfinancial  industries,  most  industries  like  construction,\r\n\r\nrenovation,   furniture,  restaurants,  watches,   jewellery,\r\n\r\ngarments  and  departmental stores,  are  performing  poorly.\r\n\r\nMany  of  them  are  having problems with cash  flow,  labour\r\n\r\nshortage and high business cost.  On top of that, because  of\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  of opening up,  the  various  MNCs  and\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies are competing with  the  SMEs  in\r\n\r\nthe  limited and almost saturated market, and many  of  these\r\n\r\ncompanies  may have to resort to retrenchment again  or  face\r\n\r\nclosure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to information released by the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower,  in the first eight months of this year, more  than\r\n\r\n400  employers were in default of CPF contributions amounting\r\n\r\nto  some $16 billion and had to face legal action.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nmore  and more enterprises are facing difficulties and  these\r\n\r\nenterprises  have  made  a  lot of contributions  during  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.  At this moment, they are required to continue making\r\n\r\nsacrifices.   They are not as fortunate as the employees  who\r\n\r\ncan  ask for pay- rise from the employers and to put pressure\r\n\r\non the Government to force the employers to restore their CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Mr Tay, we are discussing the CPF\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill.  Could you try to confine yourself  to  the\r\n\r\nnarrow field of the amendments?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): All right. Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I believe when the Government  was  promoting\r\n\r\ntripartism among labour, management and the Government,  they\r\n\r\nare  very  determined,  because this is  Singapore's  way  to\r\n\r\nsuccess.   However,  the Government cannot unilaterally  want\r\n\r\nthe  employers to continue to contribute to satisfy the needs\r\n\r\nof  labour  in conjunction with the Government's policy.   In\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  system, the Government, so far, has only asked  the\r\n\r\nemployers  to  restore  the  20%  contribution  rate  and  be\r\n\r\naccountable  to  the labour side, but no innovative  measures\r\n\r\nhave been introduced by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would like to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nurge  the  Government  to  consider the  predicament  of  the\r\n\r\nbusinesses, so as to adopt more practical and prompt  action.\r\n\r\nMaybe  the Government could consider using some of its budget\r\n\r\nsurpluses to make up  the difference of 2% to 4% in  the  CPF\r\n\r\nemployer's  contribution, so that they can  restore  the  20%\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate  sooner.  By so  doing,  both  labour  and\r\n\r\nmanagement  will  be  more convinced  with  the  Government's\r\n\r\nsupport and participation in the CPF system in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment Bill and I hope that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will  consider my above suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwhile  expressing  general  support  for  the  Bill,  I  have\r\n\r\nreservations on the provision for investment of  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount savings by members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When CPF savings were allowed for investments some years\r\n\r\nago, I spoke against this measure.  I urged caution then,  as\r\n\r\nI  did not believe that this is good for members in the  long\r\n\r\nterm.   I  believe that the general trend is for  members  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  high risk equities and stocks.  As  a  result,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  today most members actually lost money  rather\r\n\r\nthan  make money.  In other words, overall, members'  savings\r\n\r\nwould  not  be enhanced by high-risk investments, other  than\r\n\r\ninvestments in property.  Sir, the point is that by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvesting  in stocks and shares, many CPF members are  poorer\r\n\r\nrather than richer.  The only mitigating factor is that  most\r\n\r\nmembers  do  have investments in properties and that  is  why\r\n\r\nthey have done well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investment of Special Account savings in lower-risk\r\n\r\nfinancial  instruments also means that returns will  be  low.\r\n\r\nSince  most  members do not have much savings in the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount, it will be  very difficult for any particular member\r\n\r\nto  diversify his portfolio of investments or instruments  to\r\n\r\nmaximise  his  returns.   As  a result,  I  do  believe  that\r\n\r\nmembers,  with  the little bit of money they  have  in  their\r\n\r\nSpecial Accounts, will invest in some higher risk investments\r\n\r\nor perhaps in unit trusts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Bill will be passed, may I urge the Minister\r\n\r\nto  consider  setting up a Special Accounts funds  management\r\n\r\nunit in the CPF, and allow members to transfer part or all of\r\n\r\ntheir Special Account savings into this funds management unit\r\n\r\nto  be  managed by the CPF Board.  With the funds  management\r\n\r\nunit, there is a volume with a larger scale of operations and\r\n\r\ntherefore  members' savings could naturally  be  diversified.\r\n\r\nIf  we  allow members to invest their Special Account savings\r\n\r\nin  one  or two instruments, the risk is high, no matter  how\r\n\r\nyou put it, even with the lower-risk financial instruments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the Minister to consider my suggestion of\r\n\r\nsetting  up  a  funds management unit to manage  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccounts for members when this Bill is passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I\r\n\r\nwould like to thank Mr Charles Chong, Chairman of the GPC for\r\n\r\nManpower,  and  all the other hon. Members who  spoke  up  in\r\n\r\nsupport of this amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to respond to the points that were raised\r\n\r\nby Members.  Mr Charles Chong supported the provision for the\r\n\r\ncash  top-up for grandparents, and I think most of the  other\r\n\r\nMembers who spoke on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit  also  supported it.  For instance, Mr Ang Mong Seng,  who\r\n\r\nwhile   supporting  this  provision  for  cash   top-up   for\r\n\r\ngrandparents, pointed out what appears to be an inconsistency\r\n\r\nbetween the cash top-up for grandparents and the top-ups  for\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under the Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme, the\r\n\r\nchildren  have  10 years to top up their parent's  retirement\r\n\r\naccount,  from  the  age  of 55 when the  parent  could  have\r\n\r\nwithdrawn the CPF money.  The time bar was introduced when we\r\n\r\nfirst  had  this Minimum Sum Topping-Up Scheme  to  encourage\r\n\r\nchildren  to  top up their parent's CPF account as  early  as\r\n\r\npossible, rather than to drag it over a long period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of grandparents, I think it will be very\r\n\r\ndifficult to impose such a time bar.  If you do impose such a\r\n\r\ntime  bar, then very few grandparents will be able  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe benefit of this top-up.  Because, if the age limit is 65,\r\n\r\nthen  there  are going to be very few grandparents  who  have\r\n\r\ngrandchildren old enough to be working and earning  a  salary\r\n\r\nand  able  to top up their grandparents' accounts before  the\r\n\r\ngrandparents  are aged 65.  So we have decided that  for  the\r\n\r\ngrandparents' top-up scheme, there should be no time bar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we will, in fact, waive the 10-year time bar\r\n\r\nfor  the parents' topping-up scheme in the case of cash  top-up.   In  other words, if a CPF member were to put cash  into\r\n\r\nthe  parents'  accounts,  to top up the  parents'  retirement\r\n\r\naccounts, we are prepared to waive the need to have this  10-year  time  limit.  It is not necessary.  So it can  be  done\r\n\r\naway  with.  But in the case of those who may be using  their\r\n\r\nCPF  to  top  up their parents' accounts, this needs  further\r\n\r\nstudy  to  see whether if you extend the 10-year time  limit,\r\n\r\nwould  they  be able to continue to maintain such top-up  and\r\n\r\nhow  would  it  impact  on the member's own  accumulation  of\r\n\r\nsavings  for his retirement.  We need further study on  this.\r\n\r\nFor  cash top-up, we will waive the time limit.  But  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  transfer  from the children's CPF  account  to  the\r\n\r\nparents' accounts, we need further study.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong also asked about the one-year time bar\r\n\r\nfor  those who committed suicide or has committed intentional\r\n\r\ncriminal act resulting in forfeiture of their insurance cover\r\n\r\nunder   the   Home  Protection  Insurance  Scheme   and   the\r\n\r\nDependants' Protection Insurance Scheme, and he asked whether\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  could grant exemption in some cases.   Let  me\r\n\r\npoint  out that section 36(5), as it is crafted, states  that\r\n\r\n\"the Board shall not be required to make any payment if death\r\n\r\nis  by  suicide.\"  And with this amendment, the result  of  a\r\n\r\ncourt  conviction within one year of taking up the insurance.\r\n\r\nI  think the way the section is framed, \"that the Board shall\r\n\r\nnot  be  required .\", would suggest that while the dependants\r\n\r\ncannot expect the Board to pay the insurance claim under such\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  if in examining the case the Board  considers\r\n\r\nthat  there are special circumstances, it may decide then  to\r\n\r\nproceed  with  the  payment.  There is no injunction  against\r\n\r\nmaking   such  a  payment.   So  there  is  some  amount   of\r\n\r\nflexibility on the part of the Board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas also supported the amendment and I\r\n\r\nthank  him  for his support, in particular, the amendment  on\r\n\r\nthe  topping-up of grandparents' accounts, and also extending\r\n\r\nthe  definition of \"related person\" to a wider scope, so that\r\n\r\nthere  could  be  more family support.  He had  some  concern\r\n\r\nabout  whether,  in fact, giving the Minister  the  power  to\r\n\r\nexempt  certain payments from attracting CPF could  become  a\r\n\r\nloophole  that could be abused by employers.  Let  me  assure\r\n\r\nhim that we are very conscious of this possibility.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  when  we  crafted this amendment, we provided  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can  make  conditions for such exemption,  and  the\r\n\r\nconditions  will  be  very narrow.  It will  be  specifically\r\n\r\nfocused  on long service awards and would not allow employers\r\n\r\nto  take  advantage of this provision to seek exemption  from\r\n\r\nCPF  for  other payments which are normally part of wages  or\r\n\r\nsalary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked, in the same vein as Mr Tay Beng Chuan,\r\n\r\nabout the CPF cut and when will it be restored.  Our position\r\n\r\nis that we will want to restore the employer's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution to the pre-crisis 20% level as soon  as  we\r\n\r\ncan.  When we introduced the cut during the economic downturn\r\n\r\nin  1998, we thought that it might take anywhere up  to  five\r\n\r\nyears  in order to be able to turn the economy around and  to\r\n\r\nrestore the CPF cut of 10 percentage points.  But as  it  is,\r\n\r\nthe  economy  has undergone a sort of V-shape recovery  after\r\n\r\nhitting  the  bottom.  I think we are able to  speed  up  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of  restoration.  That is why on 1st April  of  this\r\n\r\nyear, we had introduced a 2% restoration, and we have already\r\n\r\nannounced  that  on  1st January next  year,  there  will  be\r\n\r\nanother  4% restoration.  If the economy continues to  bounce\r\n\r\nback  and  remain healthy and competitive, then  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  be able to speed up the pace of restoration.  And  we\r\n\r\ndefinitely do not have to wait for the full five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether we could try to get more non-employees, the self-employed, for instance, to benefit from\r\n\r\nthe CPF system.  We have already, for some years, been trying\r\n\r\nto   get  the  self-employed  to  contribute,  starting  with\r\n\r\nMedisave.   There  is a scheme by which self-employed  people\r\n\r\nhave  to  contribute to Medisave in order to be eligible  for\r\n\r\nvarious  trade  licences and permits.  It  has  worked  quite\r\n\r\nwell.   Quite a large number of self-employed people are  now\r\n\r\ncontributing to Medisave.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to point out, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that\r\n\r\nin  fact self-employed people are constantly being encouraged\r\n\r\nto  contribute  even  to  the Ordinary  Account  and  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  of  their CPF by way of tax incentives.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthey  are  entitled to claim, up to a certain  limit,  a  tax\r\n\r\nexemption  on  about $14,000 a year as voluntary contribution\r\n\r\nto  CPF.  This is one way by which we can encourage the self-employed  to  become members of CPF and  also  to  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  provided  by the scheme.  As the  number  of  self-employed  or contract workers increases, we will continue  to\r\n\r\npublicise  the scheme with such tax incentives so  that  more\r\n\r\nand  more of them will voluntarily sign up with CPF and  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the tax incentives.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas raised another point which is really not\r\n\r\nconnected  to  this  Amendment  Bill.   This  is  on  NSmen's\r\n\r\nallowance.    NSmen are not employees.  So NSmen's  allowance\r\n\r\nis  not  a salary or wage in the normal sense.  That  is  why\r\n\r\nNSmen's  allowance  does not attract  CPF  contribution.   He\r\n\r\nasked  whether  we  could increase NSmen's allowance  to  the\r\n\r\nmarket wage for people of that age group.  I suggest that  he\r\n\r\ntake  it  up with the Minister for Defence at the appropriate\r\n\r\nopportunity. I am sure the Minister for Defence will give him\r\n\r\na considered answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay supported the Amendment Bill and expressed strong\r\n\r\nsupport for the amendments that we have in this Bill, but  he\r\n\r\ntook it beyond the focus of this Amendment Bill.  He spoke at\r\n\r\nlength about how tripartite support was important for the CPF\r\n\r\nscheme.  I agree with him.  Our CPF scheme works well because\r\n\r\nwe  have  tripartite support.  Employers support  it.   Trade\r\n\r\nunions support it.  Government continues to encourage, refine\r\n\r\nand  improve  the  system.  It is almost  an  institution  in\r\n\r\nSingapore in our labour market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He expressed concern that employers are still facing\r\n\r\ndifficulties although the economy has recovered sharply.   We\r\n\r\nare  aware  that  not all sectors of the economy  have  fully\r\n\r\nrecovered.   For instance, the construction sector  is  still\r\n\r\nnot  doing  as  well  as the manufacturing  or  the  services\r\n\r\nsector.   We  also understand that some of the SMEs  are  not\r\n\r\ndoing  as well as some of the larger companies.  I hope  that\r\n\r\nhe  understands  that the CPF cut was,  in  effect,  a  blunt\r\n\r\ninstrument  to reduce cost overall across-the-board  for  the\r\n\r\nwhole  economy.   It  has  worked  in  that  it  has  allowed\r\n\r\ncompanies  that  were  facing grave dangers  to  survive  the\r\n\r\ncrisis.    Now that the economy has turned around, we  should\r\n\r\nstart  to  restore the CPF as soon as we could to the  degree\r\n\r\nthat  the  economy can support without doing grave damage  to\r\n\r\nour  own competitiveness.  I think that is what we are doing.\r\n\r\nFirst, restoration of 2% in April of this year and from  next\r\n\r\nyear onwards a 4% restoration.  We\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  these are changes that can be accommodated  by\r\n\r\nthe    employers    without   seriously    affecting    their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether we could introduce other more\r\n\r\ninnovative  measures  to  help  employers  to  retain   their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness to moderate their wage cost.  The  answer  is\r\n\r\nyes.   In  June this year, the NWC recommended that employers\r\n\r\nshould now start to introduce a monthly variable component in\r\n\r\nthe salary structure.  This monthly variable component, as is\r\n\r\nexplained in the NWC recommendation, should be built up  over\r\n\r\ntime  from wage increases that are being given to workers  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  next time we face a crisis, each company  or  each\r\n\r\nsector  could  on its own start to make adjustments  to  wage\r\n\r\ncost  without having to wait for an overall CPF cut.  If they\r\n\r\nput  aside  2%  to 3% each year of the wage increase  into  a\r\n\r\nmonthly  variable component, over the next five to six  years\r\n\r\nthey  could easily accumulate 10% to 15%.  This 10%  to  15%,\r\n\r\nwhich comprise the monthly variable component, could then  be\r\n\r\nthe  first line of defence against any sudden change or  drop\r\n\r\nin  business sentiment and they could immediately, at company\r\n\r\nor industry or sectoral level, make adjustment without having\r\n\r\nto  wait  for a national consensus on CPF cut.  I would  urge\r\n\r\nall employers to take this up seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, since the NWC recommendation in June\r\n\r\nthis  year, already about 140 unionised companies had already\r\n\r\ntaken  up  this  suggestion  and  had  introduced  a  monthly\r\n\r\nvariable  component  in their collective  agreements.    Many\r\n\r\nother  companies are also in negotiation with  their  unions,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  company unions or industry-wide  unions,  to\r\n\r\nincorporate such a monthly variable component.  Likewise, all\r\n\r\nthe  SMEs should also consider introducing a monthly variable\r\n\r\ncomponent.   The NWC recommendation was that,  if  this  year\r\n\r\nthey  are  going  to give a wage increase of  less  than  3%,\r\n\r\nperhaps  all  the  3%  should  go  into  a  monthly  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent rather than a built-in wage increase.  If they  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  give  more than 3% wage increase this  year,  they\r\n\r\nshould  consider  setting  3% aside  as  a  monthly  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  paying  the balance of the wage increase as  a  built-in\r\n\r\nwage  increase.  If all sectors do it, whether they  are  big\r\n\r\ncompanies  or SMEs, I am sure they will achieve a  much  more\r\n\r\nflexible  wage structure that will give us greater resilience\r\n\r\nthe next time the economy runs into stormy waters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok spoke in support of the Amendment Bill\r\n\r\nbut expressed reservation over the investments of the Special\r\n\r\nAccount  savings.  Let me point out that this is an  enabling\r\n\r\namendment.   This will enable CPF members to have  access  to\r\n\r\ntheir  Special Account for investment purposes.  It does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  they  all have to withdraw their Special  Account\r\n\r\nsavings and to place this in the various instruments that  we\r\n\r\nhave  designated.   We will continue to caution  CPF  members\r\n\r\nthat all investments carry some risks and they should be very\r\n\r\ncareful  in  making their investment decisions.  They  should\r\n\r\nnot  rush into it, and particularly they should not  go  into\r\n\r\nspeculative  type  of  investment.   Hence,  the  classes  of\r\n\r\ninvestment  instruments that can be approved for the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  savings are much more limited compared  to  the  CPF\r\n\r\ninvestment scheme for the Ordinary Account.  For instance,  a\r\n\r\nmember  cannot  withdraw the Special Account savings  to  buy\r\n\r\nshares  on  his own account.  We will not allow it.   Neither\r\n\r\nwill we allow him to withdraw the Special Account savings  to\r\n\r\npurchase unit trusts in the higher risk groups which are more\r\n\r\nweighted  towards  equity, wholly or  partially  invested  in\r\n\r\nequity.  So  there are already some measures to moderate  the\r\n\r\nrisk  exposure for the Special Account investor.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nat  the  end of the day, as I have said in my Second  Reading\r\n\r\nspeech,  the member has to be prudent himself and to exercise\r\n\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the suggestion for the Board to set up a Special\r\n\r\nFund Management Division and to allow CPF members to transfer\r\n\r\npart of their Special Account into this Fund for the Board to\r\n\r\nmanage, the Board itself cannot guarantee that its investment\r\n\r\ndecision  will be that much superior or that much more  risk-free compared to any of the other approved fund managers that\r\n\r\nare available in the market.  Yes, while it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrue  that if we do it as a group it will have a bigger  base\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, can be more diversified and have lower risk,\r\n\r\nlikewise,  if  a  CPF  member were to take  out  his  Special\r\n\r\nAccount savings to buy a unit trust in one of the lower  risk\r\n\r\nrated  groups,  one of the lower tiers of the  Mercer's  Risk\r\n\r\nClassification, he will be, in effect, putting his money into\r\n\r\na  bigger pool which will allow the fund managers of the unit\r\n\r\ntrust   to  construct  a  properly  diversified  and   hedged\r\n\r\ninvestment  portfolio.   So  he  will  also  have  the   same\r\n\r\nbenefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is better for the CPF member to make this\r\n\r\ndecision  for  himself and to take out  his  Special  Account\r\n\r\nsavings to invest with a reliable or appropriate fund manager\r\n\r\nthat  has already been pre-approved than for him to leave  it\r\n\r\nwith  the Board because there will be no additional advantage\r\n\r\nfor the Board to try to serve as a super-fund manager for all\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  members in this sense.  We are limiting the  choice\r\n\r\nand  the access.  We prefer to take an approach where we give\r\n\r\nthe  members  a greater option.  Perhaps, it is part  of  the\r\n\r\nprocess.   Some may make mistakes and some have made mistakes\r\n\r\nand  lost money, in the case of the CPF investment scheme for\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinary  Account savings.  Over  the  longer  term,  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that if members take a prudent and careful  approach\r\n\r\nthey  would be able to enhance their old-age savings  and  it\r\n\r\nwill  benefit them.  We believe our approach is  sounder  for\r\n\r\nthe longer term than to have the Board act as a fund manager,\r\n\r\nas suggested by Mr Chng.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have addressed the points raised by\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister whether he would consider extending\r\n\r\nthe  age  limit  beyond  65  years for  the  Home  Protection\r\n\r\nInsurance  Scheme. With longer life span  among  our  people,\r\n\r\nwould he consider further fine-tuning the scheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, the tripartism of labour-management-Government relationship is based on the basic understanding\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmutual  benefit  and mutual help.

Mr Tay accused the Government  of\r\n\r\nputting  pressure  on  the  employers  without  taking   into\r\n\r\nconsideration   their  predicament.   Can   that   be   true?\r\n\r\nEmployees  in Singapore worked very hard and made  sacrifices\r\n\r\nduring  the  crisis  to help their employers  tide  over  the\r\n\r\ndifficult times to survive the crisis.   They took a pay  cut\r\n\r\nand  CPF  cut  to  help the companies  reduce their  business\r\n\r\ncost.   The employers should not keep on asking the employees\r\n\r\nto  make sacrifices whenever they are in trouble.  Should the\r\n\r\nemployers not take other measures to solve their own business\r\n\r\nproblems?

I am very heartened to say that the Ministry\r\n\r\nis prepared to lift the time bar.

He  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  we  would  fine-tune the Home  Protection  Insurance\r\n\r\nScheme.   We are, in fact, doing it by raising the age  limit\r\n\r\nfrom  60 to 65.  If, in due course, lifespan goes even longer\r\n\r\nand  people take out even longer mortgages, then we  will  of\r\n\r\ncourse  look  at  it  again.  The comments  on  the  workers'\r\n\r\ncontributions  to help Singapore turn around  are  noted.   I\r\n\r\nagree with him that the workers have made great sacrifice and\r\n\r\ncontribution.   I  think employers should take  note  of  it.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  I said in my response to Mr Tay that  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  shoot  for  a speedier restoration  of  the  10\r\n\r\npercentage-point cut in the CPF.  As long as the economy does\r\n\r\nwell, we will try to restore the CPF cut as soon as we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Dr Wang, he asked whether there should be\r\n\r\nno  limit for the cash top-up for parents.  As it stands, the\r\n\r\ncash  top-up is to the Minimum Sum that the parents  have  to\r\n\r\nset  aside when they retire at age 55.  There is a reason for\r\n\r\nit, because of its tax benefit.  The Minister for Finance has\r\n\r\ngenerously  allowed  such  cash  top-up  for  tax  exemption.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there must be a limit to how much you can top  up.\r\n\r\nIf  we  say that there is no limit to the cash top-up and  it\r\n\r\ncontinues to attract the same level of tax benefits, then, of\r\n\r\ncourse, there is opportunity for some form of abuse.  Because\r\n\r\nyou  could put $100,000 in and claim tax relief, and then the\r\n\r\nparents  would take it out and it will be siphoned back.   So\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  bear that in mind.  But if it  is  cash  top-up\r\n\r\nwithout  tax benefit, we welcome it.  Anybody is  welcome  to\r\n\r\nput  money into their parents' CPF accounts and not claim tax\r\n\r\nbenefit,  and  leave it to the parents to enjoy the  proceeds\r\n\r\naccording  to the rules of the CPF withdrawals.   We  welcome\r\n\r\nany amount.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> I think the Minister is right that\r\n\r\nthere should be a limit.

And  over time, this limit has increased.  But for  the\r\n\r\nparents  who are still surviving, let us say when they  reach\r\n\r\n65,  at one point it was about $30,000, now it could be about\r\n\r\n$60,000, would he consider moving all those limits up to  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  $60,000,  for instance,  rather  than  unlimited\r\n\r\ncontribution, like he says, $100,000?

Mr Tay, I have given you\r\n\r\nplenty of chances to speak but you went astray.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Sir, I am just trying to clarify my\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Please clarify.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): What I would like to say is that in this\r\n\r\ntripartite arrangement, both labour and management have  made\r\n\r\nsacrifices  and contributed towards the economy of Singapore.\r\n\r\nShould  not  the  Government  also  chip  in  by  making  its\r\n\r\ncontribution and make its presence and participation felt?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minimum\r\n\r\nSum  is  structured on the basic needs of a  person  when  he\r\n\r\nretires,  and it is set at the point in time when the  person\r\n\r\nattains  the  age of 55.  So I think we should keep  to  this\r\n\r\nsame framework rather than to periodically raise this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinimum Sum for the entire cohort.  Because they have to  set\r\n\r\naside this amount of money, and the top-up should be made  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  what are considered basic retirement  needs  of\r\n\r\npersons  in  that  cohort.  As I said  before,  if  you  have\r\n\r\nchildren who want to make larger cash contribution, they  are\r\n\r\nmore  than welcome.  There is no rule to stop you from making\r\n\r\ncontribution  in cash to your parents, siblings, grandparents\r\n\r\nor to any relatives' CPF accounts.  In fact, many people have\r\n\r\nopened up CPF accounts for their spouses who are not working,\r\n\r\nhousewives,  for  instance.   Husbands  have  opened  up  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts for their wives and from time to time put some  cash\r\n\r\ninto  it,  without  seeking  tax exemptions.   And  when  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  gives  various top-ups, the housewives  therefore\r\n\r\nbenefit.  So there is no impediment if children want  to  put\r\n\r\nin  a  higher  cash  top-up than what is  allowed  under  the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum  scheme for their parents.  The problem  is,  if\r\n\r\nthey  want  to  ask for an equal tax relief,  then  it  would\r\n\r\ncreate  some  distortion and difficulties.   So  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould stay with the present arrangement as long as it is for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of tax relief.  But if it is outright,  generous\r\n\r\ncontribution, we have no difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Mr Tay, my only response is that Government is fully\r\n\r\naware of the contributions on the part of the workers and  of\r\n\r\ncourse  on  the part of the employers.  The CPF scheme  is  a\r\n\r\nneutral  system.   It is a scheme whereby employers  have  to\r\n\r\ncontribute and employees also contribute.  CPF is part of the\r\n\r\nwages,  including  the employer's portion which  is  part  of\r\n\r\nwages.  It is not an additional ex-gratia payment made by the\r\n\r\nemployers  for nothing.  It is part of the employee's  wages.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  when  we  cut it, we are in fact  cutting  wages.\r\n\r\nThat  is why we have to be so careful about cutting the  CPF.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why I explained to you earlier on, that  we  should\r\n\r\nbuild  up  a separate monthly variable component as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible, so that we do not have to periodically rely on this\r\n\r\nrather blunt instrument of cutting CPF across the board.   If\r\n\r\nwe have a monthly variable component, we would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave a much more responsive, flexible and targeted measure to\r\n\r\ndeal with any economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure him that employers' contribution to\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economic competitiveness, to our prosperity,  is\r\n\r\nfully noted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SILVER JUBILEE FUND (SINGAPORE) (REPEAL) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the economic crisis has now receded, there\r\n\r\nare  indications  of a growing need for short-term  financial\r\n\r\nassistance in the fast-changing new economy.  The  number  of\r\n\r\napplications  for financial assistance to MCDS and  the  CDCs\r\n\r\nhas  grown  in  the past one year, despite  the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nrecession.   It is still too early to say if this trend  will\r\n\r\nremain  or  if  there  are  more  fundamental  socio-economic\r\n\r\nfactors  at  play.  My officers will monitor any  significant\r\n\r\nchanges in the types and numbers of applications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to adapt our social safety net to meet\r\n\r\nthe  challenges of the new economy.  Fundamentally,  we  must\r\n\r\nhelp   families  overcome  their  difficulties  through   job\r\n\r\ntraining and re-skilling, job placement, family casework, and\r\n\r\ntheir  children's early development and schooling.   However,\r\n\r\nmany  of  them will still need temporary financial assistance\r\n\r\nto  tide  their  families  over  a  difficult  period.   Some\r\n\r\ncharities, the Community Chest, the VWOs, the CDCs and  other\r\n\r\ngroups have been providing this help.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some aspects of our social safety net must be\r\n\r\nre-designed  to  weather the turbulence of the  New  Economy.\r\n\r\nToday,  apart  from  the Government funded Public  Assistance\r\n\r\nscheme  catering mainly to Singaporeans requiring  long  term\r\n\r\nfinancial  help,  two charity funds provide  relief  to  many\r\n\r\nfamilies in temporary financial difficulty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the 25th Anniversary Endowment Fund or 25th\r\n\r\nAEF  for  short, which helps low-income families  in  various\r\n\r\nways.   Under this Fund, the Rental and Utilities  Assistance\r\n\r\nScheme  (RUAS) helps families in financial difficulty  obtain\r\n\r\nwaivers  of  their  rental and utility arrears  and  provides\r\n\r\ngrants  for  their  monthly payments  until  their  situation\r\n\r\nimproves.  The 25th AEF also funds the Centre-based Financial\r\n\r\nAssistance  for  Childcare   Scheme  (CFAC)  which   provides\r\n\r\nchildren   from   low-income   families   early   development\r\n\r\nopportunities while enabling their mothers to return  to  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.  There are currently about 600 families under RUAS\r\n\r\nand about 400 children under CFAC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second charity fund is the Silver Jubilee Fund or\r\n\r\nSJF.    It primarily provides a basic allowance for destitute\r\n\r\npersons,  under the Special Grant scheme. All  Special  Grant\r\n\r\nrecipients  are  non-citizens who  are  considered  Permanent\r\n\r\nResidents.   They are mainly the elderly or  those  unfit  to\r\n\r\nwork  and without other means of support. There are currently\r\n\r\nabout 190 such cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has been reviewing ways to strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  social  safety net for low-income families and  to  help\r\n\r\nthem  break out of the poverty cycle in the long  term.   The\r\n\r\n25th  AEF  was  constituted in 1991 by Trust  Deed  from  the\r\n\r\nbalance   of   the  funds  raised  during  Singapore's   25th\r\n\r\nAnniversary  celebrations. The SJF was set up  in  1935  from\r\n\r\nfunds raised during the Silver Jubilee of King George V,  and\r\n\r\nhistorically  it has been managed under statute.   These  two\r\n\r\ncharity   funds  have  similar  objectives  in  serving   the\r\n\r\ndestitute  and  low-income families  in  Singapore.   Merging\r\n\r\nthese  two  funds  will bring together their  administration,\r\n\r\nreduce overheads and ensure their combined\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresources  are  optimised to meet changing needs.   With  the\r\n\r\ndelegation  of  social assistance schemes to  all  CDCs  next\r\n\r\nyear,  a  common fund will streamline the approval  processes\r\n\r\nfor people to get help faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is therefore intending to set up a common\r\n\r\nfund,  by pooling together the proceeds of the 25th  AEF  and\r\n\r\nthe SJF.  This new fund will be targeted at helping the needy\r\n\r\nand  continue  to fund existing schemes such as  the  Special\r\n\r\nGrant, RUAS and CFAC schemes.  The new fund will also support\r\n\r\nselective  programmes run by Voluntary Welfare  Organisations\r\n\r\n(VWOs)  for  low-income  families,  with  emphasis  on  those\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that  help build their capacities  to  break  the\r\n\r\ncycle of poverty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An endowment fund by way of a Trust Deed will be set up,\r\n\r\nso  as  to give more flexibility in meeting the needs in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   The combined balance of these two charity  funds\r\n\r\nis  estimated to be $44 million, while the gross  expenditure\r\n\r\nis  expected  to  be  $2.5 million a year.   My  Ministry  is\r\n\r\ncurrently  working  on  plans  to  augment  this   sum   with\r\n\r\nGovernment funds.  Our plans for the new fund to uplift  low-income  families  will be announced in due  course.   As  the\r\n\r\nfirst  step, however, towards the formation of this new fund,\r\n\r\nthe SJF (Singapore) Act will have to be repealed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, I decided to speak on this Bill because\r\n\r\nit  seems to me that the Bill did not clearly set out to what\r\n\r\npurpose or to what use the monies in the Silver Jubilee  Fund\r\n\r\nwould  be  put to.  Incidentally, we have not been  told  how\r\n\r\nmuch  there is in this Fund.  I do not know why we  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  told  that.   But this is a charity, and  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister recognises that this is a charity fund.  And if  one\r\n\r\nlooks  at  the preamble to the main Act, you will  find  \"And\r\n\r\nWhereas  the  subscribers to the said  Fund  agreed  that  it\r\n\r\nshould be devoted to the relief of distress in the Settlement\r\n\r\nof Singapore:\".  So there was an agreement that it would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  devoted  to  the relief of distress in the Settlement  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And again, if you look at section 18 of the  Act,\r\n\r\none  finds  that the Committee would inquire  into  cases  or\r\n\r\nclasses of distress brought to its cognizance and may at  its\r\n\r\ndiscretion  grant relief or assistance out of moneys  at  its\r\n\r\ndisposal.  So in form and in nature it is a charity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister speaks in general terms about the fund\r\n\r\nbeing  merged  with  the other fund in  existence,  the  25th\r\n\r\nAnniversary  Endowment Fund, and used  to  help  lower-income\r\n\r\nfamilies  and to promote schemes to help them.  I  think  the\r\n\r\npurpose and the use to which the moneys are going to  be  put\r\n\r\nshould be spelt out more clearly in this Bill.  It cannot  be\r\n\r\nleft  in  a vague phraseology that it shall be used  to  help\r\n\r\nlower-income families.  The fund says it is for the relief of\r\n\r\ndistress - distressed families who are in need of help -  and\r\n\r\nthat  is why this fund was set up.  I am sure whoever advised\r\n\r\nthe Government on this Bill have no doubt of the doctrine  of\r\n\r\ncypres  that  where  a charity fund is to  be  wound  up,  an\r\n\r\napplication  has  to  be  made to the  court  specifying  the\r\n\r\npurposes to which the moneys are to be used.  And the court's\r\n\r\npermission  is sought before the moneys are actually  put  to\r\n\r\nany other use,  because this is a trust created and agreed to\r\n\r\nby  those who subscribed that the moneys would only  be  used\r\n\r\nfor one purpose and, that is, to the relief of distress.   If\r\n\r\nit  is  to  be used for anything that goes beyond that,  then\r\n\r\nclearly  the court's permission should be sought.  The  court\r\n\r\nwould  have to decide whether these purposes accord with  the\r\n\r\nwishes of those who set up the fund because that is the whole\r\n\r\nessence of the trust - that those who subscribed gave it  for\r\n\r\na  specific  purpose, and you have got to honour that  trust,\r\n\r\nand  not  use  it  for anything other than for  what  it  was\r\n\r\nagreed.   So to just say, as it says in this Bill,  that  the\r\n\r\nmoneys  in  the account shall be paid into such fund  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  may  direct is too wide, and there is no  guarantee\r\n\r\nthat  the trust placed by the subscribers and those who  paid\r\n\r\ninto this fund will be honoured in the disposal of the funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr S.

It is done in a very concerted manner, and that\r\n\r\nis  the  basic objective that we have to look at.  The Member\r\n\r\nis  trying  to keep something which is already out  of  date.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the issue is:  would the poor get help as quickly\r\n\r\nas   possible?   Are  there  adequate  funds  that  would  be\r\n\r\navailable to help them?  This is the basic issue that we have\r\n\r\nto address. The repeal of the Act, Sir, is one way to address\r\n\r\ntoo  many set-ups where it can be very confusing for the poor\r\n\r\nto get the help required.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill to repeal the Silver Jubilee\r\n\r\nFund  Act.   I see that there is little fund left for  it  to\r\n\r\ncontinue.   But  with the amalgamation of this  fund  of  $44\r\n\r\nmillion, many poor and disabled and those who need help could\r\n\r\nbe given the necessary support.

Indeed, the 25th AEF has been used for RUAS.  It is\r\n\r\nused for temporary relief of those not under PA, but yet need\r\n\r\nhelp  to pay for their arrears in rent and utilities.   As  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier in my speech just now,  the  fund  of  $44\r\n\r\nmillion  would be augmented;  we will come back to Parliament\r\n\r\nto ask for more funds to help more needy people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the 190 persons that are currently under\r\n\r\nthe  fund,  they will continue to be helped.
