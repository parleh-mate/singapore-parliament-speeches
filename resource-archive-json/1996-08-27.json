Government decided to restrict CPF investments in shares to companies which meet the criteria in the Trustees Act. The intention was to exclude non-trustee companies which are smaller and without a track record. When the Investment \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Scheme was liberalised in 1993, non-trustee shares were allowed subject to some limits under the Basic Investment Scheme. As for the Enhanced Investment Scheme, no restrictions were placed on non-trustee shares. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies which meet the trustee criteria have generally been stable. However, this cannot be taken to mean that investment in trustee stocks is guaranteed to be safe and sound. That is why CPF members are urged to exercise prudence and judgment in investing their CPF savings. By requiring CPF members to set aside their Minimum Sum and limiting them to investing 80% of the remaining balance, the CPF Board has helped to reduce members' exposure to risks in the stock market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 1997, the CPF Board will merge the Basic and Enhanced Investment Schemes into a single CPF Investment Scheme. Under this Scheme, eligible members will be able to invest up to a maximum of 20% of their available savings in non-trustee stocks. This was announced on 19th March 1996 when I informed this House of the merging of the Investment Schemes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND BOARD</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Recovery of CPF moneys from people affected by</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>compulsory acquisition of land)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether, in view of the financial need to initiate the relocation process, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board will refrain from recovering CPF moneys from the 20% advance compensation payment of those affected by the compulsory acquisition of land for the North-East MRT line and comprehensive development and to do so only after they have received the remaining compensation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, CPF savings are meant for a member's retirement needs. That is why all moneys withdrawn under the CPF housing schemes must be returned to the member's CPF account, together with any accrued interest, when the property is sold \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> or transferred. The rationale is no different for properties acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the advance payment of compensation package was introduced, Government made a conscious decision not to interfere in the financing arrangements that affected land owners may have made for the acquired properties. This position is applied equally to all parties which have claims on the compensation awards, including the CPF Board and the lending banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who face a cash flow problem already have a way out, which is to surrender the title and undertake to deliver vacant possession before they are paid the full 100% compensation award, part of which they can use as payment for an alternative property. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that Land Office will expedite the processing and payment of the awards. Priority will be given to individual owners with genuine cash flow problems. If the land owners wish to, they can occupy the same property on rental until it is required by the authorities for development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the above, my Ministry is unable to accede to the Member's request for CPF Board to refrain from restoring CPF moneys from the 20% advance compensation payment to CPF members. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Thomson GRC):</b> Sir, in view of the fact that the CPF Board is a statutory board, unlike the commercial banks, and also the owners are being asked to move out because of the compulsory acquisition, and they need the money to assist them in the relocation and pay the initial payments for their next home, will the Minister re-consider his decision? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, we have considered all these factors that the Member has brought up and, as I said in my main answer, the solution to members who are affected by cash flow problems is to now opt to surrender the property to the Land Office and to collect the 100% compensation award which, as I said earlier on, the Land Office will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> expedite the processing of such claims and the affected land owner or property owner can get the full payment quickly and he can proceed to make arrangements for alternative premises, whether it is a shop or a home. But in so far as the CPF money that has been used for the purchase of this property is concerned, the present rule must apply because, as I said, not only will such owners face similar claims by the lending banks, they also have to ensure that they are able to meet their obligations to the banks that have loaned them the money. Even if the CPF Board does not want to make a claim, the banks may well proceed to make the same claim. So there is no assurance that this method will solve the problems of the affected property owner. The best solution is to opt to surrender the property, collect the full compensation and then make arrangement to buy an alternative property. In the interim, he can continue to occupy the premises and pay a small rental to the Land Office. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Will the Minister review the situation in view of the fact that we are here discussing moneys which are rightfully that of the home owners and it is with a statutory board, not a commercial bank, and also that the home owners will return the money to the CPF after they have received the total compensation? All they need is the initial money to pay for the downpayment for their next home. And in view of the fact that they are being moved out because of compulsory acquisition by the Government, will the Minister show some compassion for them? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of course, I am very sympathetic to those property owners whose properties have been acquired. The question of why these properties have been acquired had been discussed at length on other occasions. I think right now we are talking about whether the 20% upfront compensation should be left entirely to the discretion of the property owner or should be utilised as he had already committed himself to, ie, when he took money from the CPF account to purchase this property, he had \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> allowed a charge to be placed on the property. Whether the property is subsequently sold, transferred or acquired by Government makes no difference. He should refund the money that he has first received in payment for the property to the agency which has a charge on the property. We have to maintain this principle. Otherwise, we could allow ourselves to be caught in all kinds of situations. In future, there will be other claims and requests and the protection of the CPF savings will not be complete. Our concern right now is to ensure that the members' CPF savings are properly protected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that he is in a difficult position because his property has been acquired, but the solution to his problem cannot be to waive the protection that is necessary for his CPF savings. The solution for him is, as I said earlier on, to take the 100% compensation that is available to him immediately. It would be made available as soon as his case is reviewed by the Land Office. The Land Office has assured me that they would expedite all such cases to ensure that compensation awards are paid expeditiously. I think that is the only solution. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that the home owners need time to purchase their next home and the fact that they will return the charge, which is rightfully the CPF, at a later date after they have received full compensation, will the Minister use his discretion, and I understand that he has the discretionary power, to intervene to prevent the CPF from immediately imposing the charge? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, I have tried to explain to the Member that even if the CPF Board were not to proceed with the charge to seek the reinstatement of the CPF savings that have been withdrawn, it does not mean that the member can enjoy the full 20%. It may well be that he has to meet his obligation under his mortgage. The banks may also want to make their claim. So the solution as advocated by the Member is incomplete because although the CPF Board may be prepared to waive the charge, private lending banks may not want to waive the charge. So the member will still have the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> same problem. The real solution for the member who has a cash flow problem now in trying to find alternative premises is to take up the offer of the Land Office: take full compensation, remain on the property for as long as he needs to during the transitional stage and then move out when his new property is ready or when it is required for development. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, I agree with the Minister that if it is a charge by a commercial bank, the home owners will have no choice. But in view of the fact that this charge is by the CPF Board, which is a statutory board, and it is a matter of time that they will eventually return the moneys to the CPF Board, will the Minister reconsider his decision? Because many of them are in financial difficulties and they need the money to put the downpayment for their next home and they are moving out in view of Government acquisition, not of their own choice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some property owners have also taken up bank loans apart from withdrawing money from their CPF accounts to finance the purchase of their properties. Therefore, it is not only a case of settling the issue with the CPF Board. There are other lending institutions involved too which have also placed equal charges on these properties. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister is not answering my question. My question is: if the charge is by the CPF Board, not a commercial bank, will the CPF give this concession? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is no. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR NORTH-EAST MRT LINE</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Alternative accommodation for affected residents)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon</b> asked the Minister for Law whether he will allow the residents who have given up their homes as a result of the compulsory acquisition of land for the North-East MRT line and comprehensive development to stay on in the acquired homes at a nominal rental \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> until they are able to relocate to their new homes, and, if not, whether he will consider providing alternative accommodation at a nominal rate to the residents affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Law):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of rental only arises if the landowner has received his full compensation moneys but wants to remain on the acquired land. He has, in fact, the alternative of receiving only 20% of the compensation moneys and staying on rent-free on the acquired land until it is due for possession by the Land Office. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a landowner surrenders his acquired land in return for full compensation, he should vacate the site. Allowing him to remain on the land at nominal rental after the acquisition would defeat the purpose of paying him full compensation at vacant possession rate. The Government already makes a concession by allowing him to remain on State land by paying a rental as assessed by the Chief Valuer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, in view of what the Minister for Labour has just said that he would not relent to the owners' request that the 20% advance compensation be waived from the CPF charge and that there would also be a charge by commercial banks, some owners will have tremendous difficulty in moving to their next home. And in view of the fact that some of them have to move by March of 1997, they need time. They need the money to buy the next home and need time to move. And some of them need time to renovate. In view of all these, after they have received the full compensation, will the Minister concerned take this into consideration and allow them to continue to stay in their previous homes at nominal rental? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Government realises that this is indeed a massive infrastructural project. Completion is estimated at seven years. And, in fact, for the land acquisition exercise, we have phased it out over five years - three scheduled dates for taking \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> possession - and all landowners already know at this point in time when they are supposed to move out. In other words, there is advance notice and they can plan accordingly. So they have a choice. If they do not want to move out and they want to stay, they will get the 20%. Very soon we are processing that, and we are going to pay that very shortly. And if they want to stay, they stay on rent-free until the time when they have to give possession. If they want to move out, then they are paid full compensation. They do not have to move out until the date of giving possession is up. And for those in the other phases - there are three phases (first phase is March 1997, second phase is July 1999, third phase is July 2001) - they have ample notice. So taking these factors into consideration - the fact that there is advance notice, the fact that there is a choice and the fact that regardless of when you are leaving, you will be getting a 20% advance compensation very soon - I think the Government, being sympathetic to the plight of affected landowners, has acted to soften the impact. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, in the event the Ministry concerned is not going to pull down the homes after full compensation has been paid and therefore the homes are left vacant, will the Ministry then consider allowing them to stay on at nominal rates? Because the homes are just being left vacant. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> For those staying on after they have been paid full compensation is not the problem. The question is at what rental. The principle is if you are given full compensation at vacant possession rate, in other words, it is a quid pro quo, you are paid that amount to deliver vacant possession, and if you want to stay on, then I think it is fair that you pay market rental as assessed by the Chief Valuer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that this is a very unusual situation where home owners are being asked to move out in view of compulsory acquisition. They are willing to go. It is a question of facilitating \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> their relocation. So can I ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary what is the problem with allowing them to stay on in a vacant building at nominal rental? It is going to be empty. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Again, as I said, the Government is mindful of the sacrifices that may be made by landowners. In fact, Mr Mah Bow Tan, when he announced in Parliament in January this year, said, and I quote him: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The North-East line will bring many benefits to the residents of the North-East. ... But let me stress that there will be sacrifices involved. ... The Government will need to acquire land ... . But these sacrifices are inevitable if we take a long-term perspective and do what is best for the nation. ...' So bearing this in mind, knowing that the project is indeed massive, as I have said earlier on, Government has taken measures in terms of the length of the project, in terms of acquiring these properties in different phases and in terms of even allowing the person to stay on after he has been fully compensated. The Member is right in saying that if the flat or the house is vacant, why not let him stay. And we say, yes, he can stay. He does not even have to physically move out. He can continue staying but, as I said, having been paid full compensation at vacant possession rate, it is fair that he pays market rental. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Sir, I think the compensation that some Sennett Estate residents got was not full compensation and there was a lot of apprehension as to what was full compensation. And that is why the Member is asking for nominal rental in vacant premises. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Can I have a clarification? Should the owner stay back and not move out, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary has said that he pays market rental. I have the impression that he does not pay the market rental but he pays only for the interest that the Government would have lost by giving full compensation. Is it right? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> No. He wants to remain on the premises after being paid full compensation, ie, the statutory \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> compensation, which is the value of the property as of 1st January 1995. Beyond that, of course, the ex-gratia payment will take some time to compute. Ex-gratia payment is the difference between the value as of 1st January 1995 and 4th March 1996. Going back to Mr Chiam's point, if the owner wants to remain on the premises after being paid full compensation at vacant possession rate, he pays market rental as assessed by the Chief Valuer. And, Sir, in fact, this is the practice. A property owner who sells his property and wishes to remain on the property after the sale will make an arrangement with his buyer. If he wants to remain on the premises, and the buyer allows him to do it, he will pay market rental, not nominal rental. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, the responses of the Minister for Labour as well as the Minister for Law have been standard answers and they are terms which have already been well publicised and made known to home owners. My point is that in view of the fact that the residents affected by the compulsory acquisition need to facilitate relocation, that they need to reduce the unhappiness and hurt they have suffered all these months in view of the Government's action, that this is a concession on the part of the Ministry concerned. So my question to the Senior Parliamentary Secretary is whether we could allow them to stay on at nominal rates in buildings/flats which would otherwise remain empty and therefore less revenue for Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Government has made many concessions for this NEL exercise. Earlier on, I have mentioned about the time-frame, the advance notice and also the ex-gratia scheme was amended in June 1996. The ex-gratia scheme is a top-up scheme where besides the statutory compensation as of 1st January 1995, if the property is worth more than what you get for statutory compensation, we value it on 4th March 1996, date of acquisition, and you get the difference subject to a ceiling of $2 million. In addition, this ceiling has been raised from $1.8 million to $2 million. And besides that, previously there was a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> condition that if you were an owner-occupier of a residential property and you had another residential property, then you were not entitled to ex-gratia payment. But we have lifted that and as long as you are occupying a residential property, despite the fact that you may have other residential properties, and you are dislocated, you will get ex-gratia payment. And more than that, under the revised scheme in June 1996, owners of acquired shophouses who are doing business in the shophouse will also be entitled to ex-gratia payment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Member will appreciate this. As I have mentioned earlier, quoting the Minister for Communications, Government is sympathetic to the plight that MPs present on behalf of their constituents. But it is not as though Government has not moved. We have looked at the whole thing in its entirety and, in fact, have packaged in several features that will show that this exercise has been softened for the constituents. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The Minister says that in relation to shophouses, ex-gratia payments will also be given. Will it be given to the owners of the shophouses or to the tenants? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, compensation money is always paid to the owners because the quid pro quo is that he gives title of the property over to the State. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>APPLICATION FOR HDB FLATS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Relaxation of 30-month debarment period for people affected by compulsory acquisition of land)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether he will relax the 30-month debarment period for the application of Housing and Development Board flats for those affected by the compulsory acquisition of land for the North-East MRT line and comprehensive development and, if so, whether he will grant them priority allocation in view of the fact that some of them have to surrender their properties by March 1997. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, owners whose private properties are acquired by the State for public development can claim compensation on either encumbered basis or vacant possession basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owners of private properties which are encumbered would receive lower compensation when their properties are acquired by the State. To help such owners, HDB then exempts them from the 30-month debarment period and the $8,000 income ceiling when they apply for new HDB flats. In addition, they are granted priority allocation of HDB flats. While waiting for the completion of their new flats, they can also apply for HDB rental flats as transitional accommodation for a maximum period of three years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owners who can deliver vacant possession of their acquired properties to the State will receive higher compensation. They would be able to secure alternative housing on their own and should not join the queue for subsidised public housing with other HDB flat applicants who have less means. Therefore, they are not exempted from the 30-month debarment period when they apply to buy flats directly from HDB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New HDB flats are not the only housing option for owners of acquired private properties. Other housing options that such owners can consider are HDB flats sold in the open market and Executive Condominiums sold by the private developers. Regardless of the basis of compensation for the acquired private property, the 30-month debarment period is waived for these two types of housing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that the Government acquisition has led to tremendous financial difficulties on the part of some home owners and in view of the fact that their family income ceiling may be less than $8,000, and they are downgrading while most Singaporeans are upgrading and the special circumstances as well, as I have mentioned earlier, will the Senior Parliamentary \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Secretary re-consider the decision not to remove the 30-month debarment period to allow them to apply for HDB flats? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, had their homes not been acquired, they would not have been eligible to join the HDB queue without the 30-month debarment period.

The alternative accommodation for them would have to be bought from the open market or, if they wish to join the HDB queue for subsidised housing, they need to wait for a 30-month debarment period, which is the same for all the other owners of private properties. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, the Senior Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that property prices have gone up very high. And in view of the fact that many of these home owners, despite the fact that they will get full compensation, will be unable to afford private housing, and that they want to downgrade and their family income is $8,000, which means they qualify to apply for HDB flats, except for the 30-month debarment period, will the Senior Parliamentary Secretary re-consider his decision again? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, this formula for compensation on an encumbered basis or vacant possession basis is a well-established one. It has been applied to the farms that had been resettled, the squatter settlements and the various kampongs that we had in the past.

He says that the quantum of compensation is more for those who move out and less for those who stay behind. How does the Ministry determine this quantum of compensation for those who move out early and for those who move out late? Is the difference in quantum due to the rentals that they would have to pay? How are these two amounts determined? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, delivery of the property on an encumbered basis does not mean that he decides to stay behind or not move out. What it means is that when he delivers the property to the State on an encumbered basis, he also asks for certain other privileges or benefits which include partly a resettlement package. Under the resettlement package, the Government will offer to him an HDB flat, direct from HDB, lifting of 30-month debarment period and priority for the allocation of such a flat. For that benefit, he gets a lower compensation and the calculation is done by the Ministry of Law based on a certain formula that they have come up with. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that the Senior Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to remove the 30-month debarment period, will he consider offering them alternative accommodation at concessionary rates, if they have nowhere else to go, after receiving the full compensation and while waiting to move to their next home? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, we do not have such a scheme at the moment and we have not been thinking along those lines yet. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the Senior Parliamentary Secretary consider this scheme and implement it? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, it is unlikely that we will go along this direction because the compensation formula and packages are long established ones.

So most of the residents will be told how much they are getting by the end of September and given the fact that it takes more than three months to do a transaction, they have less than three months left to look for alternative properties.

Firstly, because, like I said, it depends on the landowner. He may have a scheduled date for handing over, but he can leave earlier. And even if you ask me, for example, to let you know which residents in Potong Pasir are scheduled to leave by March 1997, which residents by July 1996 and which residents by July 2001, the question is: should it be furnished to third parties? It is a different matter if the Member asks his residents and they let him know these dates. But for us to furnish a list like that may have other consequences. Landowners may not want that date to be made known. Otherwise, they may be inundated, for example, by real estate agents who will pester them about finding alternative accommodation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SECURITY DEPOSIT FOR FOREIGN MAIDS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. \n  <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau</b> asked the Minister for Labour whether he will consider waiving the forfeiture of $5,000 security \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> deposit for foreign maids in the event they abscond and the employers have done their best to locate them but to no avail. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the security bond is a safeguard to ensure that employers take responsibility for their foreign workers, including domestic maids, and repatriate them upon the cancellation of their work permits. The security bond is forfeited if the employer fails to repatriate the foreign worker regardless of the circumstances. Sir, this condition is made very clear to applicants for work permits. Without the security bond, employers may not exercise proper control over their foreign workers, resulting in more missing workers who may end up creating social problems. There could also be problems of irresponsible employers abandoning their foreign workers under the guise of missing or runaway workers which could lead to friction with labour-exporting countries. The problem of missing maids is not rampant. In fact, my Ministry's record showed that as of April 1996, the cumulative number of missing maids was only about 200. This is minuscule compared to the hundreds of thousands of foreign domestic workers who had come to Singapore over the years. We should not change a system which has worked well and enabled the vast majority of foreign domestic workers to return to their home countries expeditiously after their contract with their employers was completed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, my Ministry is not completely inflexible in cases where the domestic workers have absconded. As a practice, we do not forfeit the security bond immediately. We understand the unhappiness of employers who are faced with the problem of absconding domestic workers. We have, since November last year, extended the grace period from 14 days to one month after the cancellation of the missing worker's work permit for employers to search for their missing workers before forfeiture of the security bond. Even after forfeiting the security deposit, a refund can be considered if the missing worker is found within three months and the employer has assisted or furnished information to my Ministry or Immigration Department leading to the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> location of the missing worker. This could be extended to six months on the merits of the case. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Sir, in the event that the employer has exercised all due responsibility, including provision of the air tickets and having sent the domestic worker to the employment agency and while in the care of the employment agency, the maid absconds, whose responsibility is it? Will the security deposit be forfeited from the employer, or is it the maid agency's responsibility? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> As I said, when an employer applies for a work permit for a foreign worker, whether it is a foreign construction worker or a domestic worker, he undertakes the responsibility of repatriating the foreigner on completion of the contract. That is very straightforward. The employers have taken on the responsibility to repatriate the foreigner. If they choose to pass this responsibility to somebody else who subsequently fails to discharge the responsibility, it does not absolve them of the responsibility. Therefore, in cases where the employers have passed the domestic worker to some agent and expect the agent to do what is right, and if the agent fails to do that, unfortunately, under those circumstances, the bond may well have to be forfeited, unless the maid is subsequently located and repatriated. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Sir, I am more concerned about the missing workers. What steps is the Government taking to trace these foreign workers and how successful are we in solving this problem? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, we are equally concerned with these missing workers. Where have they gone to? What are they up to? Which is why we have a system to minimise the occurrence of such cases. The Immigration Department and the Work Permit Department from time to time come across these workers who have left their employers and who are just hanging around in Singapore. Those who \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> are discovered, we repatriate them as soon as we can obtain the proper documents for them. Some of these so-called missing workers have also taken refuge and shelter. In some cases, they may have taken shelter in their own mission. These are cases which are resolved quite easily because we have good working relationships with all the missions here. And if the workers report to them and are unwilling to go back to their employers, we will intervene to resolve the disputes with the employers and the workers can then be repatriated quickly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Sir, since the deposit will be forfeited when the maid absconds, why is it necessary for the employer to keep on paying the levy, even after he has reported to the Ministry? And he is paying the levy for a maid who is not there. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, if the employer discovers that the domestic worker has absconded and he chooses immediately to cancel the work permit, then no levy is payable. He does not have to pay any levy. But if the employer says that he is going to make his own effort to look for the maid and in the meantime keeps the work permit valid, then of course the levy has got to be paid. Because there is no way for my Ministry to go round and check on every household to see that the worker who has absconded is not working there or working for somebody else in the neighbourhood. It is impossible for us to check on every household considering the number of such foreign domestic workers. So, as long as the work permit is still valid, the employer will have to continue to pay the levy. As I said, the moment the employer discovers that his maid has absconded, it is up to him to decide what to do. He can cancel the work permit, in which case all obligations to pay the levy stop and then the security bond will be invoked. And he will be given, as I said in my explanation, up to six months to look for the maid or to provide information that could lead to the repatriation of the foreign worker, in which case the bond will be refunded to him. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, in the event the maid is missing and the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> employer is able to get news, it is often not possible for the employer to physically drag the maid to his or her home. Which department would be able to assist? Would it be the Immigration or the Police? Because some residents have said that when they approached the Police, they say it is the Immigration. When they approached the Immigration, they say it is not their duty. Which is the right agency to assist them in this task of getting the absconded maid back? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> If the employer has information on the location of the maid, they can provide it to my Ministry. We will see how we can assist to repatriate the maid. Of course, we will also need the assistance and cooperation of the Immigration Department in doing so. But we will work together. The employer can provide the information to the Work Permit Department of my Ministry or to the Immigration Department. We will act to locate the maid and repatriate her. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, an employer tries to repatriate his maid and at the airport the maid threatens suicide. It is not possible for the employer to send the maid back but has to get the help of an agency. The agency gives a written undertaking to repatriate the maid. Is the employer still held responsible for the abscondment of the maid in the event that it happens? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> We are prepared to look into such cases if the employer has obtained a clear or written undertaking from an agency which would take on the responsibility. Because, as I said earlier on, until the domestic worker is repatriated, the employer is, in law, responsible, because he has given us a security bond. But if the agency is prepared to give him a warranty of some kind or an undertaking that they will be responsible, then we can look into how to make the agency accept this responsibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SMALL FAMILIES IMPROVEMENT SCHEME</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Number of families who benefited and number disqualified)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Imram bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. \n  <b>Mr Imram bin Mohammed</b> asked the Minister for Community Development \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> how many families are benefiting from the Small Families Improvement Scheme; and how many families had subsequently disqualified from the scheme and for what reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Sir, the Small Families Improvement Scheme was introduced in January 1994.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68) (\"CPC\") to enable offenders to plead guilty by electronic means under the Automated Traffic Offence Management System or \"ATOMS\". \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Pleading Guilty by Electronic Means</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, composition fines are currently paid in several ways, including by cheque, phone bank and ATM. If the deadline for payment of the composition fine has expired, offenders must appear in court to answer for their offences. ATOMS will enable offenders to settle traffic tickets containing an offer to compound even if the deadline for payment has expired provided they do so not later than two days before the appointed court date. The offender does this by pleading guilty to the traffic offence and paying a court fine at purpose-built kiosks. In addition, ATOMS will provide another means for offenders to pay their composition fines. For a start, only first time traffic offenders for which an offer of composition has been made can make use of ATOMS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ATOMS is one of the services offered by NETS kiosks. Nine of these kiosks have been set up at convenient locations. Let me assure Members that ATOMS will be user-friendly. Basically, the user will be responding to questions posed by touching on the screen. Payment \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will be made by ATM card. If the system proves effective, the service can be extended to cover other minor regulatory offences for which offers of composition have been made. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Benefits of New System</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ATOMS will be the first system of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region. Of course, nobody should commit traffic offences. But for some reason or other, they happen. When this happens, offenders will find the system convenient. They can settle their traffic tickets at their own time at any nearby kiosks. There is no need to go to court and time is saved. Also, judicial time will be freed to hear more serious cases. The Subordinate Courts have assessed the potential annual savings from the implementation of ATOMS at $113,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>New Section 137A</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to pave the way for ATOMS to be introduced, a new section 137A will be added to the CPC. The provision will allow a person accused of specified offences to plead guilty by electronic means so that he does not have to appear physically before the Magistrate's Court. The Minister is empowered to determine: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the offences (within the class of offences punishable by fine or by imprisonment not exceeding three months or by both) in respect of which an offender may plead guilty by electronic means; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the class of offenders eligible to plead guilty by electronic means. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc.

Exemption was given to the first $3 million of all residential properties and the first $500,000 of all movable assets, including Central Provident Fund balances. Central Provident Fund balances in excess of $500,000 were also exempt. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To compensate for the effects of inflation since 1984, the Estate Duty (Amendment) Bill 1996 seeks to do the following: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to raise the value of the estate on which the first tier rate of tax of 5% would apply to $12 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to raise the exemption limits for residential properties and movable assets (including Central Provident Fund balances) to $9 million and $600,000 respectively; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to exempt Central Provident Fund balances in excess of $600,000 from duty. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 and 4 of the Estate Duty (Amendment) Bill will provide for the increase in the value of the estate which the first tier rate of 5% would apply from the previous $10 million to $12 million. Clause 3 of the Amendment Bill will insert a new subsection to raise the exemption limits for residential properties and movable assets (including Central Provident Fund balances) to $9 million and $600,000 respectively. These changes would apply to persons who pass away on or after 28th February 1996. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I have a question for the Minister.

Opportunity is also taken to incorporate three other amendments to the Income Tax Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Changes Announced in the 1996 Budget Statement</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall begin with the tax changes that were announced in the 1996 Budget Statement. There are a total of six tax changes that require amendment to the Act. First, on changes pertaining to tax rates. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have announced in the 1996 Budget Statement that with effect from Year of Assessment 1997, the corporate tax rate will be reduced from 27% to 26%. Clauses 9, 10, 11 and 13 of the Bill provide for this change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also announced that with effect from Year of Assessment 1997, the top marginal individual income tax rate will be lowered from 30% to 28%, with appropriate reductions in the other rates. In addition, the number of tax brackets will also be reduced from 14 to 10. Clauses 8 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and 16 amend section 42 and Part A of the Second Schedule to the Act respectively to effect these changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to encourage the development of activities which require high input or funding from overseas as well as to facilitate the development of Singapore as a knowledge and technology hub, withholding tax on royalty and interest was reduced to 15% of gross of such payments with effect from 28th February 1996. Clauses 7, 9, 11, 12 and 14 amend the relevant sections of the Act for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next three tax changes pertain to existing tax concessions. First, since the Year of Assessment 1992, banks are allowed to claim tax deduction for general provisions made for loans and investments in securities. To encourage finance companies to build up their reserves, general provisions made by such companies for their loans and investment in securities will also be allowed tax deduction with effect from Year of Assessment 1997. Clause 4 amends section 141 to provide for the extension of this incentive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to encourage the use of highly efficient pollution control and energy-efficient equipment, I have announced that businesses will be allowed to claim capital expenditure on such equipment over a one-year period instead of over three years. Clause 5 amends section 19A for this change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Members are aware that since the Year of Assessment 1993, National Servicemen are given tax reliefs of $1,000 for active NSmen and $500 for those who have done full-time national service but are now not in the active national service. As the value of these reliefs has been eroded by subsequent reductions in personal income tax rates, I have announced that the reliefs will be increased to $2,000 and $1,000 respectively with effect from the Year of Assessment 1997. In addition, as a recognition of the contribution of parents and wives of the NSmen to Total Defence, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> parents of NSmen as well as their wives who are Singapore citizens will be eligible for tax relief of $500. Clause 6 thus amends section 39 to provide for these changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Changes not announced in the 1996 Budget Statement</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with three tax changes which were not announced in the 1996 Budget Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first pertains to maintenance payments received by a parent under the Maintenance of Parents Act. Under the Maintenance of Parents Act, a person could be compelled by a maintenance order to make maintenance payments to his parents. Clause 2 amends section 10 of the Act such that these payments would not be deemed as income in the hands of the parents and are thus not subject to income tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tax change deals with accommodation benefits provided to an employee. At present, any gains or profits from employment carried out in Singapore are subject to tax. If the employee is provided with accommodation by his employer, such accommodation benefits will also be subject to tax. This is provided for in the existing Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of the accommodation benefits to be taxed is, however, subject to a cap of 10 per cent of the employee's gains from employment (other than the accommodation benefits), less any rent paid by him. Currently, the Act does not include the gains derived by an employee from share options under the definition of his gains from employment. Such gains from share options are, however, taxed under a separate sub-section. Clause 2 therefore amends section 10 to make it clear that gains from share options should be taken into account in the computation of an employee's total gains from employment for the purpose of deriving the taxable value of accommodation benefits under the Act provided to the employee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last amendment is to allow taxpayers to claim capital expenditure on plant and machinery under construction. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> At present, under section 19A of the Act, a person who has incurred expenditure on plant and machinery could choose to depreciate them over a three-year period instead of the longer periods specified under the Sixth Schedule of the Act. Depreciation allowances will be granted only if capital expenditure has been incurred and the plant and machinery are in use at the end of the basis period for that Year of Assessment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the construction period of large-scale plants may be very long. As such, the taxpayer may not be able to satisfy the condition that the plant must be in use at the end of the basis period for that Year of Assessment for the purpose of claiming the depreciation allowances. Clause 5 thus amends section 19A of the Act to allow claim of depreciation allowances under this section for capital expenditure incurred on plant and machinery even though the asset has yet to be put to use. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, conservation of water is a national policy. The Government, in fact, penalises businesses and individuals who over-use water. I believe there is no incentive in the Income Tax Act given to both businesses as well as individuals to conserve water. I notice that in clause 5 of this Bill, the Government is going to give an incentive. In fact, it is going to give taxpayers an allowance of 100% in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the provision of efficient pollution control equipment. Similarly, this benefit is also given for business people who incur capital expenditure on any energy efficient equipment. If the Government is serious about conservation of water, I would ask the Minister whether he is also willing to give such incentives to taxpayers, both the businesses as well as individuals who have water conservation equipment. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to give a response to an exclusion in clause 2 (b) which amends section 10 to deem any maintenance payment received by a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> parent or a child under a maintenance order not to be income subject to tax. I would like to ask the Minister what about a wife's maintenance payment received under a maintenance order. Why is this considered income subject to tax and not treated like maintenance for a parent? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> On Mr Chiam's question, I think there is an existing provision for tax relief on installation of highly efficient water recycling processes. If not, it would certainly be something we would seriously consider. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question by Dr Soin, I do not quite follow her question. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> My point is no income tax is charged for maintenance payments received by parents. That is what the Minister said about clause 2. But yet when wives receive maintenance from their husbands, those maintenance payments are subject to income tax. Why is there a discrepancy? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> No. Awards made under the Maintenance of Parents Act are free of income tax. That is so. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> So I want to know why is the same privilege not extended to maintenance payments which are made by the courts for wives. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Outside the Maintenance of Parents Act? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Yes. Outside, obviously. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> We are dealing with the Maintenance of Parents Act and not on this other issue. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Clarification, Sir. I realise that. But I would like to know what is the policy, what is the thinking, that you can allow a parent who gets maintenance not to have to pay income tax. A parent is an adult. But you do not give the same privilege or right, I would say, to a wife who gets a maintenance ordered by the court. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> For other reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> For maintenance of wives, yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Particularly, say, in the case of a divorce? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> That will be treated as normal income, yes, subject to tax. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> So I would like to ask what is the Minister's thinking. Why is it that the maintenance of a parent is not considered income, because it is for the subsistence of the parent, while the maintenance for a wife which is for her subsistence is considered as income? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I think the difference would be that in the case of maintenance order for, say, a wife who receives such payment because of a divorce, the tax component is already built in. In other words, it is income which will be subject to normal tax, whereas under the Maintenance of Parents Act, it is a special treatment accorded to the taxpayer for a specific reason. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I have a clarification? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Is the Minister assuring the House that if there is no provision in the Income Tax Act to give incentives to taxpayers to conserve water, he will look into it? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HIJACKING AND PROTECTION OF AIRCRAFT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore acceded to the Montreal Convention in 1978. This Convention requires contracting parties to recognise as offences acts of violence against passengers and crew on board civil aircraft, and acts that endanger the safety of aircraft. Singapore implemented the provisions of the Convention by enacting the Hijacking and Protection of Aircraft Act in 1978. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports serving International Civil Aviation (the Protocol) supplements the Montreal Convention. It came into effect on 6th August 1989. This Protocol aims at preventing acts of violence at international airports so as to protect and preserve the smooth operations of international air services and the security of passengers, airline personnel and facilities. Contracting parties to the Protocol will be given jurisdiction to try all offenders who commit acts of violence against international airports or to extradite them to the country of offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill therefore seeks to amend the Hijacking and Protection of Aircraft Act (Cap. 124) to give effect to the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports serving International Civil Aviation. Specifically, it seeks to make the following main amendments: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) create a new section 6A to make any act of terrorism committed against persons, airport facilities or aircraft parked at any international airport a specific offence; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) amend existing section 7 to make the abetment of such an act of terrorism a specific offence; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) make consequential amendment to the First Schedule of the Extradition Act (Cap. 103) to make these new offences extraditable crimes as required under the Protocol. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>New Section 6A - Offence of Acts of Violence which Endanger Lives or Property and Safe Operation at any International Airport</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Protocol, as a supplement to the Montreal Convention deals, in essence, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> with acts of violence at international airports that cause serious injury or death, damage or destroy airport facilities or aircraft or disrupt airport operation. Clause 5 of this Bill, therefore, seeks to create a new section 6A. Section 6A(1) makes it an offence for any person to intentionally, by means of any device, substance or weapon, commit an act of violence at aerodromes serving international civil aviation, if such act causes or is likely to cause serious injury or death and endangers the safe operation of the airport or the safety of persons at the airport. A new section 6A(2) makes it an offence for any person to intentionally, by means of any device, substance or weapon, cause serious damage or destruction to the facilities of the airport or to any parked aircraft or disrupt airport services by such means and which act also endangers the safe operation of the airport or the safety of the persons there. Subsection 6A(3) makes it an offence for such acts to be carried out at any international airport and by any person, regardless of his nationality. The penalty for an offence under the new section 6A is imprisonment for life which is the same penalty applicable to hijackers as spelt out under section 8 of the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Amendment to Section 7 to Extend Section to Cover Abetment of Acts of Violence</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently it is an offence under section 7 for any person to abet the commission of any offences under the Act. As a logical extension, it is necessary to amend section 7 to make abetment of any offence under the new section 6A an offence. Clause 6 of this Bill seeks to amend section 7 to make the abetment of any act of terrorism at an international airport under the new section 6A an offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Consequential Aamendment to Extradition Act (Cap. 103)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Protocol requires that these new offences be extraditable crimes. Currently, hijacking and other offences under the Hijacking and Protection of Aircraft Act are already listed as extraditable offences under paragraph 29 of the First Schedule \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to the Extradition Act. Clause 8 of this Bill therefore seeks to amend paragraph 29 of the First Schedule to the Extradition Act (Cap. 103) to include the new offences under section 6A, that is, acts of violence endangering safety of an international airport, as extraditable offences. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Other Amendments</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Hijacking and Protection of Aircraft Act has been extended to include offences relating to international airports, it is necessary to amend the long and short titles of the Act to reflect this. Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend the long title to include the Protocol. Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to amend section 1 of the Act to rename the Act as the Hijacking and Protection of Aircraft and International Airports Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment, read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>WOMEN'S CHARTER (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read. \n  <br>2.02 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Community Development (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Third time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee on the Bill received a total of 32 representations by the closing date. The Committee heard eight of these representations. I wish to express my appreciation to those persons who had given their views to the Select Committee. A number of the points raised by the representors dealt with administrative or operational issues, or issues already addressed under the provisions of the Bill. The Committee considered issues on points of law and points of policy raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recommends some amendments to the Bill after studying the written submissions and the oral evidence of the representors. The Committee also considered the views of the Members of Parliament expressed during the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill on 2nd May 1996. The Committee's Report has been circulated to Members of the House. Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now highlight the substantive issues deliberated upon by the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Marriage involving Transsexuals</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the provisions to allow those who have undergone sex-reassignment to marry, one amendment is proposed. Several representors raised the concern that the provision to accept the notation of sex in the identity card issued under the National Registration Act as \"conclusive evidence\" of a person's sex would be too rigid and problematic. The Committee agrees with this view and recommends that the words \"conclusive evidence\" be replaced by \"prima facie evidence\" to address this concern. This amendment is reflected in clause 4 under proposed section 11A(3)(a). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Protection of Family</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two amendments are proposed to the provisions of Part VIA on \"Protection of Family\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Referral of victims and children to counselling \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a suggestion to empower the court to refer not just the perpetrator of family violence to counselling, but also the protected person and their children. The Committee agrees with this proposal and recommends that the Bill be amended to incorporate this provision. The amendment is reflected in clause 11 under section 60B(5)(b). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Applicants for Protection Order on behalf of victims \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several representors suggested that besides the persons stated in section 60B(10), other persons such as officers from Family Service Centres (FSCs) or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and respected community leaders should be allowed to apply for a protection order on behalf of a victim. Of particular concern is the well-being of an abused child or incapacitated person whose parent or guardian is unwilling to seek protection on his or her behalf. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is indeed merit in expanding the ambit of persons who may act on behalf of the child or such incapacitated person. However, there is also risk of abuse or unsubstantiated frivolous complaints if the coverage is too wide. Hence, the Committee recommends that the amendment seeks to allow only \"persons appointed by the Minister\" to act on behalf of a child or incapacitated person. The amendment is reflected in clause 11 under section 60B(10). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Definition of \"Family Violence\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several representors suggested expanding the definition of \"family violence\" to include \"sexual act or conduct\". They felt that this would give victims of sexual misconduct within the family a recourse for civil remedy instead of a criminal remedy as provided in the Penal Code and the Children and Young Persons (CYP) Act. It was also felt that the expansion of the definition would enable a victim to obtain protection on a balance of probabilities under the Women's Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee notes that sexual misconduct between a married couple is difficult to ascertain. Where there is sexual misconduct between a married couple and if they feel it is worthwhile to keep the marriage intact, the referral of the couple to counselling on a voluntary basis would be a more appropriate measure. Seeking a court order may only precipitate separation and break-up. But the Committee is also of the view that forced sex between estranged couples or between members of the family should be seen in a more serious light and should be dealt with under the provisions of the Penal Code and the CYP Act. However, where the victim prefers to seek a protection order against such misconduct and not seek a criminal remedy, the Committee is of the view that the definition of \"family violence\" in the Bill, which includes \"causing continual harassment with intent to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cause or knowing that it is likely to cause anguish to a family member\", is sufficiently wide to accommodate such complaints. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I reiterate that this Government takes the issue of family violence very seriously. The Government also believes that the community and community organisations have a role to play, and together with the Government, the problem of family violence can be better tackled. It is with this belief that the Inter-Ministry Work Group on family violence had worked very closely with the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (SCWO) and the Society Against Family Violence (SAFV) to come up with recommendations to address the issue of family violence. Such collaborative and concerted efforts between the Government and the community should be encouraged. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Maintenance</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Stronger enforcement measures \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of maintenance, several representors called for stronger enforcement measures to address the hardship experienced by many women in collecting maintenance for themselves and their children. The Committee supports the proposal for stronger enforcement measures. The Committee considered the suggestions made and recommends several new provisions to be incorporated. One provision is to clarify that a sentence of imprisonment ordered for non-compliance with a maintenance order will not affect or diminish the obligation of the person to make maintenance payments. Currently, if a man contravenes a maintenance order and if he is sentenced to a jail term, he does not pay the arrears of maintenance. This does not address the financial needs of the wife and children. This new provision will address this concern. However, to ensure that no hardship is imposed on men who may have genuine difficulties, the court should be empowered to reduce the amount of such payments if it deems fit. This is reflected in clause 14 under section 63(1A). In addition, Sir, the Committee recommends new provisions to allow the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> court to issue attachment of earnings orders when making a maintenance order and to make garnishee orders. These new provisions are reflected in clause 14 under section 63(1)(c) for garnishee and clause 20 under section 74(1) for attachment of earnings orders. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, there is a 3-year bar for recovery of maintenance arrears. There was a suggestion to waive this bar under special circumstances like in situations where a wife may have genuine reasons for not applying for recovery of arrears before the expiration of the three years. The Committee supports this suggestion and recommends provisions in the Bill to allow the court to waive the time bar under special circumstances. These amendments are reflected in clause 30 under section 115(3). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Maintenance for children above 21 years \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several representors recommended that children above 21 years old should be allowed to claim maintenance on their own as well as to impose limits on their eligibility to claim maintenance. Such limitations are to safeguard parents against claims from adult children who are undeserving or are able to maintain themselves. The Committee agrees with both suggestions and recommends that the Bill be amended to allow a child above the age of 21 years to claim maintenance from his parent on his own, and to spell out the circumstances under which an adult child can claim maintenance. The amendments are reflected in clause 12 under section 61A(3)(b) and (5). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Maintenance for children below 21 years \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some representors were of the view that a sibling who is above 21 years old and other adults should be allowed to claim maintenance on behalf of a child who is below 21 years old. This is to address concerns that a young child may not have someone to act on his behalf if, for example, the other parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to do so. The Committee supports the suggestion and recommends that the Bill be amended to allow an adult sibling or a person \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> appointed by the Minister to make a claim on behalf of a child who is below 21 years of age. The amendments are reflected in clause 12 under section 61A(3)(c) and (3)(d). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Circumstances for maintenance \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee also recommends that amendments be made: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to allow the court to take into consideration the conduct of both parties to a marriage when making a maintenance order; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to provide for maintenance of a wife to cease upon the wife's remarriage. The proposed provision to allow the court to take the conduct of both parties to a marriage into consideration is consistent with section 108 which deals with maintenance during matrimonial proceedings or subsequent to a grant of a decree of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage. The provision that maintenance should cease upon a wife's remarriage is a logical and fair provision. These amendments are reflected in clause 12 under section 61A(4)(h) and clause 29 under section 111. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Maintenance for husbands \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Kanwaljit Soin had proposed during the Second Reading of the Bill that partial rights under special circumstances, if not full rights, be extended to husbands to claim maintenance from their wives. Sir, differing views were received from representors on this by the Select Committee. Those who supported this proposal argued that an increasing number of women are better educated and earning just as much if not more than their husbands. Those who supported partial rights suggested that such rights be extended to a man when he is disabled or has custody of the children and needs to take up a part-time job. Those who objected to the extension of maintenance to husbands argued that the reality of the situation is that the majority of women still earn lower salaries than their husbands. In most cases, the burden of caring for children, the house and the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> spouse still falls largely on women. These representors were of the view that as disparity still exists between men and women, it would be untimely to consider such a proposal at this juncture. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee notes that women have advanced over the years. However, the Committee also notes that there is still some disparity, though a decreasing one, between most men and women. As such, the Committee agrees that it may not be timely to introduce such a provision now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Committee also notes that there are existing provisions in the Women's Charter under which a mother can be required by the court to maintain her child. A mother is therefore not absolved from maintaining her children if she is in a position to do so. The Committee thus recommends that the existing provision for only men to maintain their wives and children be retained. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Division of Matrimonial Assets</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a suggestion was made during the Second Reading of the Bill for the principle of equality to be reinstated in the division of matrimonial assets. The concerns of a few representors were that: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the spouses who did not contribute financially to the assets would be placed at a disadvantage with the removal of the phrase \"inclination towards equality\" since their non-financial contributions to the marriage might not be deemed as important; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the removal of the phrase would signal to the courts that they need not incline towards equality when deciding on the division of assets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee recommends the retention of the provisions in the Bill relating to \"Division of Matrimonial Assets\", after taking into consideration the comments of the representors as well as the Members in the House. The Committee is of the view that any law that has to be enforced effectively must be devoid of inherent inconsistency. The proposed provisions in the Bill allow the court to divide the matrimonial assets in a just and equitable manner after taking into \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> consideration all circumstances of the case, including a homemaker's contributions. The Bill has also enlarged and clarified the circumstances which the court should take into consideration. As such, it would seem inappropriate that the court would still be required to incline towards equality. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law must provide for all cases, ie, marriages of long as well as of short duration, and marriages under unusual sets of circumstances. For example, where a marriage is of short duration with no children, the law must not put judges under constraint to incline towards equality when what is equal may not be just. The Committee is of the view that the provisions of the Bill are fair. Indeed, it is a better formulation than the current one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the concern that existing case law would be disregarded with the new provisions, the Committee is of the view that it is not the intention for the body of case law built up over the years to be cast aside, but that it should continue to serve as a guide to judges in their decisions. Sir, we should not, in our quest for equality between the sexes, compromise on what is just and equitable. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Harmonious Resolution for Family Disputes</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of representors suggested a provision to be included to reinforce the principle of harmonious resolution for settling family disputes and to allow for the referral of disputing parties to reconciliation, mediation or counselling, as well as children of the parties to counselling, if necessary. I am heartened, Sir, that there is the desire that we must do what we can, and exhaust all means available in the community to help save a family from breaking up. The Committee shares this spirit of harmonious resolution and has recommended amendments to the Bill to empower the court to refer parties to attend reconciliation, mediation or counselling sessions, where necessary. The provisions are reflected in clause 10 under new sections 47A and 47B. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, three broad concepts underlie the proposed amendments to the Women's Charter. The first concept is the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> relatively straightforward one of making technical improvements to the Charter, so that it becomes more consistent, more coherent. The second is the emphasis on harmonious resolution and healing in the aftermath of family discord. To this end, a number of the proposed amendments empower the court to refer the parties for reconciliation, mediation or counselling. At least, the courts now have the ability to gently guide them back on the path of recovery if there is hope. And where there is no hope or where the parties have completely given up, the third concept comes in, ie, to seek to alleviate the hardship experienced by all sides to the conflict. For example, the proposed amendments towards a stricter and fairer outcome on issues relating to maintenance and division of matrimonial assets provide for more avenues for the distressed party to seek assistance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law alone cannot prevent family disputes from arising. It takes the concerted effort of community groups, individuals, the Government and, in particular, individual members in the family to ensure the well-being of the family and its members. The law, especially the Women's Charter, can only help regulate wisely and justly the multi-faceted nature of our relationships within the family. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very happy that the deliberations of the Select Committee have led to further improvements to the Bill. I believe that from the lengthy discussions we have had over the provisions of the Bill, we have also gained greater understanding and appreciation of important issues concerning women and families in our society. I would like to highlight improvements in three areas in particular that address concerns that I and others have raised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to touch on the area of maintenance. I am pleased that the Bill has been amended to provide more teeth to the enforcement of maintenance orders. There are now new provisions \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which will allow the court to issue an attachment of earnings order at any time, and not only when the husband has breached the maintenance order. In addition, the court can now also make a garnishee order. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two new measures will address the hardships faced by many women whose husbands deliberately fail to pay up promptly or who refuse to pay. The court can now give an attachment order at once, rather than only when the husband eventually does not pay and the wife has lodged a complaint. This will save the wife from unnecessary costs, time and headache. The garnishee order, which is practised in some countries, will provide another more effective way of collecting maintenance from husbands who claim they have no regular earnings and have accumulated arrears. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further improvement is the provision which makes it necessary for the husband to continue to pay arrears of maintenance to his wife, even when he is imprisoned, although the court has the discretion to order a lower maintenance payment. This is a point which was unclear under the old law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another welcome amendment is the provision to enable a child above 21 years to apply for maintenance for himself, as well as to apply on behalf of a sibling below 21 years if his mother or guardian is unable or refuses to apply for them. This is a logical development, in view of the decision to expand the scope for payment of maintenance to children above 21 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I am happy to note that a pro-active provision has also been introduced to enable persons appointed by the Minister, possibly social workers and community leaders, to apply on behalf of a child who has no one else to apply on his behalf. I have spoken on this point many times, and I feel that community leaders are in touch with the ground and it would be easier for families in distress to approach them for assistance compared to a Government servant. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 530</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area I would like to mention is on matrimonial assets. On matrimonial assets, the new provisions have adopted a broader approach on this issue. The new provisions allow the court to divide the assets in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deciding what is just and equitable, the new section 106(1) requires the court to take into consideration not only the financial contributions of the parties but also their contributions towards the welfare of the family, particularly contributions in looking after members of the family, the aged or infirm relatives of either the husband or the wife. In this respect, as women are usually the main care-givers in the family, they would benefit from the new amendment as their non-financial contribution would now be given greater weightage. Taking these factors into consideration, the court can award more than half to the wife in cases where, based on her total contributions to the marriage, the court is of the view that the wife deserves more. Can the Minister confirm my understanding of this section? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On protection of the family, the new provision of the Women's Charter has strengthened and enhanced protection for the family and is thus a most welcome amendment. Under this new Bill, protection is expanded to cover not only the spouses and children but also parents, siblings and even any handicapped family member. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the new amendments have also widened the definition of \"violence\" to include psychological hurt, and has increased protection for the victims. It will be much easier for women to apply for Personal Protection Orders, and they could also have a warrant of arrest attached to the PPO if there is immediate danger of violence being committed against them. In more serious cases of violence occurring within the family, there is the Penal Code which extends added protection to the family members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, through these deliberations over the Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill, we have all become more \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 531</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> aware of the problems faced by some families in Singapore who are at greater risk because of domestic problems. We have also become more aware of the need for individual and collective efforts in helping these families. At the same time, we must continue to strengthen family relationships, which is a more effective long-term strategy in preserving families and dealing with broken families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthening our existing laws is an essential step to address the problems arising from family breakdowns. But the law is only one aspect of what I have suggested should be a multi-pronged approach. I would like to restate the five actions that should be taken together. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, strengthen existing laws. The Women's Charter (Amendment) Bill is a balanced piece of legislation and will enhance protection for women and family members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, streamline administrative procedures for the Police. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, provide training to qualified counsellors and train the Police on how to handle family disputes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, provide community support for families with such problems through the Ministry of Community Development, voluntary organisations and grassroots organisations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, and most importantly, inculcate the right family values through homes, schools and public educational programmes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, once again, to call on the Minister to strengthen the administration and resources of the Ministry of Community Development to help voluntary groups and others in the community to be more visible and pro-active in protecting and promoting a healthy family life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The status of women and family relations are dynamic, especially in our modern and rapidly changing society today. We must periodically review together the relevance of our laws and practices, as we have done in amending the Women's Charter with this Bill. I \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 532</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> believe that our consensus in support of the amendments and the spirit of our deliberations show our commitment to achieving a shared vision for a better quality of life for all Singaporeans, regardless of men and women. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in our cultural context, women and children who are vulnerable need to be protected. If they are abused by men, I am sure my Parliamentary colleagues will agree with me that we need to protect them all the more. The amendments to the Women's Charter set the right direction in dealing with the problems arising out of matrimonial issues, maintenance, domestic violence and appropriation of matrimonial assets. I support the amendments to the Women's Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few useful areas which the amendments have taken care of. First, women who have protracted difficulties, particularly those who have difficulty in ensuring that they are being maintained, now under these amendments, are being supported. I think it is in the right direction because many of the women and children are vulnerable. They are left with a financial burden and the amendment on this maintenance issue provides support for them and ameliorates them from becoming destitute and leaving the burden to the State to provide support for them. All the more, the responsibility is on the husband who has neglected and abused them to maintain his wife and children who, more often than not, are unprotected. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 533</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the usefulness of these amendments is that the mother and children who are affected by domestic violence are now being protected. This has been a growing problem in our community and there are many women and children who remain in silent pain who need to be protected. They will be relieved from being abused by their husbands. These amendments set the right direction to provide adequate protection for them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I see that the usefulness of these amendments is that voluntary organisations will be given more support. They will be more effective in monitoring and providing services and in dealing with families that have matrimonial problems and difficulties. So the Bill strengthens their capacity to deliver and administer programmes in counselling and guidance to deal particularly with men who abuse their wives and children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two areas of concern that I have relating to the Amendment Bill, ie, the question of time lag to obtain protection order and the enforcement of protection order. The wife and children are, as you know, helpless when they are subjected to domestic violence by the husband. They have to be protected quickly because their limbs and lives are endangered. There is a need to narrow the time lag in obtaining a protection order. When a protection order is issued, it is most important to ensure that it is enforced quickly. Because of the bureaucratic rulings and applications, there may be delay. I feel that the Bill does not address this issue. There is a need for quicker action to deal with the problems of domestic violence. It is a matter which is urgent and where there is much abuse. When it is known and quickly reported, swift adequate protection should be given to the mother and children who are being abused violently. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last concern that I have is the legal cost. The changes and amendments to the Bill are good. They help to provide protection for the mother and children who require help and support. But it is the concern on the legal cost that these \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> mothers, particularly those in the lower income group, have to bear. The legal aid support may be inaccessible because of the tight income ceiling eligibility set to qualify for legal aid. Although we may have a good Bill which provides protection, many of these cases may require legal support which they face difficulty. I would like the Minister to see how we could provide easier legal support and services to this group who may otherwise not be able to put their case forward and for their problems to be dealt with. These are some of the critical issues that need to be addressed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my assessment and reading of the amendments, we have made the essential amendments to provide further protection for mothers and children who are neglected and abused and who are to a great extent traumatized. Many issues relating to family problems cannot be dealt with by law alone. Even with these amendments, it does not guarantee the protection for mothers and children. What I see as most important is to be able to initiate more public education programmes for our younger generation in order to prepare them to be effective parents who would be caring and supportive of their family. If we can do that, then I do not think we would require further changes in our legislation to deal with such problems arising out of matrimonial difficulties. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 534</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>VISIT OF THE HON.

I see contradictions in adopting the position of allowing wives to claim maintenance from their husbands but disallowing husbands to do the same. Sir, let me explain. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter was first passed in September 1961 and at that time it was hailed as a very progressive piece of legislation. One of the main reasons for labelling it thus was section 45 which laid out the equal rights and duties of a husband and wife, and I stress, equal rights and duties of a husband and wife. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read this section 45 to refresh the memories of some Members who seem to have forgotten it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Upon the solemnization of marriage, the husband and wife shall be mutually bound to cooperate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union and in caring and providing for the children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The husband and wife shall have the right separately to engage in any trade or profession or in social activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The wife shall have the right to use her own surname and name separately. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The husband and wife shall have equal rights in the running of the matrimonial household. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, as far back as 1961, the Women's Charter clearly propounded the idea of marriage as an equal partnership between a man and a woman. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty-five years have rolled by and a whole new generation has grown up. New realities have emerged which are in keeping with the original enlightened section 45 of the Women's Charter but the sad fact is that the present repeal and re-enactment of section 61 is out of step with section 45 of the Women's Charter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-enacted section 61 allows a wife to claim maintenance from her husband but does not allow a husband to have the same right. This is not only at variance with section 45 but is also incongruous with today's reality of economically active wives. There is no rational distinction between a financially able husband and an equally financially able wife. 40% of married couples have both wives and husbands working for a living. 80% of new brides are working and among the younger couples, one-third of the brides are marrying grooms with lower educational qualifications and presumably these brides are therefore earning more than the grooms. In this changed socio-economic context, why are wives not being asked to shoulder the responsibility of supporting their husbands financially? If the Minister does not want to take such a bold but necessary step, then he may wish to consider a compromise, and politics is full of compromises, and follow the example of the Malaysian law which gives limited rights to the husband to claim maintenance from his wife when he is ill or incapacitated. During the Select Committee hearings, I think five representors representing women's groups expressed the view that maintenance to husbands, especially in appropriate cases, should be given. These women's groups represent the views of a wide cross section of women. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the changed socio-economic context of 1996 as compared to 1961, and considering that women's groups generally want the law to be changed, especially when husbands are disabled or sick, I fail to understand the reluctance and resistance of the Minister \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 537</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to take cognizance of this. Besides ignoring many women's views, there are wider implications of not allowing husbands to claim maintenance from their wives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a woman is capable of supporting her husband or her former husband who needs maintenance, especially if he is sick or disabled, then why are we allowing the woman to get away without fulfilling her responsibility? If a woman earns a good income but does not voluntarily want to support an ill husband, why should this burden then fall on society and the taxpayers while the woman gets away scot-free? A comparison can be made with the Maintenance of Parents Act where unfilial children have to shoulder the responsibility of maintaining their parents and not leaving it to society in general. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you one concrete example. A wife who is a stockbroker is earning a lot of money but she does not get along well with her husband who happens to be sick and has kidney disease and therefore is unable to work. The husband and wife, as I said, do not get along well and so the wife does not want to support him. Why should the sick husband not be able to claim maintenance from his wife but instead he has to turn to Medifund or some other publicly financed agency to help him in his health care costs and for his daily care and needs? Why should society have to maintain the husband when the wife or the ex-wife is shirking this responsibility but can afford it? \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>3.16 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to take on our rightful responsibility towards our husbands and to consolidate the idea of marriage as a partnership, many individual Singaporean women, women's groups and I want husbands, especially those who are sick and disabled, to be able to claim maintenance from their wives. However, the Minister is not listening to us. And this situation puts us in a difficult and no-win position because \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 538</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> as long as this discrimination exists in law, women will be accused of not shouldering their responsibilities. This is manifested in some of the letters which are written to the Straits Times complaining that since women do not have to maintain husbands, women should not be asking for equality of treatment in other fields. Through no fault of ours and because the Government does not want to listen to us, the women of Singapore have to put up with the barbed insults of some Singaporean men. I would therefore like to request the Minister to equalise the situation in the law by just changing the word \"wife\" to \"spouse\" and that is all the Minister will have to do. And if at this time there are very few husbands who would want to claim maintenance from their wives, so be it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the male MPs have told me that they would never accept maintenance from a woman as this would hurt their male pride. To them, I would like to say that for the truly needy husbands much more than their male pride will be hurt if they get no maintenance from their wives when they desperately need it. Also, what will be the effect on the children of these families when mothers are seen to be able to get away without supporting the sick or disabled husbands and instead the children have to see their fathers turning to public agencies for help as their mothers are not being legislated to help these needy husbands? We should never let this happen, Mr Deputy Speaker. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister's reply to this is that wives can be persuaded to support their husbands without appropriate legislation, then I would like to ask the Minister why do we need legislation for husbands to maintain their wives? Why do we not also rely on persuasion? It is precisely because persuasion alone without legislation is insufficient to do the job. Surely the Minister does not believe that women are morally more upright than men and therefore can be easily subject to persuasion and do not need legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would really like an extensive reply from the Minister on this score because the women of Singapore want to know why this responsibility is being denied to them. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 539</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to comment on the issue of maintenance for husbands which has been brought up by the Nominated MP, Dr Soin. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, in Singapore, husbands are deemed to be the head of the family and are responsible for looking after the welfare of their wives and children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> It has nothing to do with gender equality nor subjecting the wife to be subservient to the husband. Marriage is a physical as well as a spiritual union between two persons. It is not a commercial contract and should never be viewed as such. Entrusting the husband the responsibility to look after the family is a social value which we have adopted for our society and I think it is a correct one. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument that women are now better educated and earning just as much if not more than the husband is only partially true, as the majority of our women are still dependent on the financial and moral support of their husbands. The present provision for the wife to claim maintenance from the husband therefore should still be maintained. And I am sure that the majority of our women will have no problem with this concept. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was argued that there may be cases where the husband may become terminally ill or handicapped and may not be able to be gainfully employed. In cases like that, in our Asian society I doubt very much that many of our women will abandon their husbands just because they contracted terminal illness or have become handicapped. To use financial means to absolve one's marital responsibility is not in our Asian culture nor should it ever be. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an unlikely situation where such cases do happen, I am sure the immediate families will rally around them, failing which the MCD - I am sure the Minister will agree - or other social organisations will provide sufficient schemes to look after these unfortunate cases, if there are any. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 540</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, perhaps the most important fact for us to consider now is that the Women's Charter is essentially legislated for the protection of women. Although it has been extended to cover certain aspects for the protection of the aged and children, I feel strongly that the main focus should still be on protection of women and there is no compelling reason at this point of time to widen the scope of the Bill to the protection of men. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, after listening to the points raised by my colleagues, I think I am left with very little to say. I just like to recall an incident about a month or so ago. One of my constituents came to my Meet-the-People session. He came in full army uniform. He is currently serving national service. He came together with his fiancee and asked how come his marriage application was rejected. He said, \"I serve in the Army and that means I am a man. But when I applied to register my marriage, my application was rejected (because he was born a female)\". So he felt very awkward to be accepted as a man, and at the same time to be treated as a woman when it comes to marriage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because I serve as one of the Members in the Select Committee, that evening I was able to explain to him that an amendment is currently being considered for the Women's Charter and after we have passed this Bill, I am sure he would be happy that his application for marriage would be accepted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I mentioned this story because I remember the glow in his face after I explained that we are doing something about it. His fiancee was also happy that they were given a chance, despite the odd situation he was in, that he can now form a family and try his best to live happily ever after. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think many aspects of the Amendment Bill provide for more people to be happier, more smiles on the faces of husbands and wives, even though they may be in dispute. I took special interest in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 541</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the fact that during our deliberations, the Committee, under the able leadership of our Speaker, had been rather cautious and careful in handling all the issues, including the question of whether husbands should be given the right to claim maintenance from their wives. There are several grey areas which tell very vividly that there is no single rule that can be used as a guide in the relationship of husband and wife. I am glad to note that during our deliberations we have made some changes which are enough to cover over the next few years the need for families to try and maintain a harmonious relationship. I have no doubt that many years ahead we may need to further amend some aspects of this Bill or the Act itself. But I am glad to note that we have not drawn too many lines and decided that certain aspects of family life should be guided by law. I think that is the right approach for I do not believe two problems involving the family can be solved by the same set of guidelines. It is not easy, Sir. Therefore, I believe the recommendation made by the Select Committee to allow the courts to make a decision, based on all aspects and matters pertaining to the disputes, is right. And I believe that this new Bill will serve Singapore well. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, first, I would like to thank the Members of the House who spoke on the Bill, especially Dr Soin for her impassioned speech for women. I must say that I empathise with many of her feelings. And I must say too that many people, many males indeed, empathise with what she said. But the fact of the matter is that there are also many people who feel otherwise, even women. To say that all women feel the same way is not true. Even during the representations, the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations (SCWO), which is an umbrella women's organisation, spoke against the maintenance for husbands, even in a limited way, because they thought that it would impose further burdens on the wife who is already burdened with the duties in the family and maybe perhaps also with duties as a worker. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 542</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand her eagerness to extend maintenance payments to husbands, especially in the light of current debate on women being accused of not playing their part in society. I do not want to get involved in this male/female argument. I want to stay above all these. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She mentioned that there is some incongruity between section 61 and section 45 of the Women's Charter. Section 45 of the Women's Charter existed since 1961, as she mentioned. Maintenance for husbands was never in the Act and nobody made any squeak about it. It was only recently when a review of the Women's Charter was made that somehow along the way people say that section 61 is now contrary to section 45. I understand that things have changed and things are changing. But at this moment in time, I think the general view is that, as has been mentioned by Mr Kenneth Chen, the Member for Hong Kah GRC, it is the husband's duty to maintain his wife morally and legally. And I think this is shared by many men outside this House, and certainly after you have heard the \"ayes\" from this House, that it is the view of most of the Members of this House here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to respond to Mdm Yu-Foo. She asked whether it would be possible in the current amendment that working women could indeed get a bigger share of the matrimonial assets. The possibility is there, because the court will take into consideration all the circumstances leading to the divorce, including the non-monetary contribution to the home. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked whether it would be possible for us to strengthen family life and to give better help to women in trouble and maintenance enforcement. The answer is yes. We can do it administratively and, certainly, I give the House the assurance that my Ministry will be looking into the administrative ways of how we could coordinate the work between the Government, the VWOs, the courts and the Police. We will certainly do that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen has insisted that the Women's Charter is for the protection of women. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 543</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Indeed, it is. That was the whole objective of legislating the Women's Charter and the main thrust of the Charter still remains today. I think we should let the Women's Charter remain as a legislation which protects women. It may be that it has been enlarged to protect the family and other members of the family, but mainly the emphasis is on the protection of women. And I think it should remain that way. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments have been thought out very carefully. It has been debated quite extensively in this House, in my Ministry, with the voluntary welfare organisations and also in the Select Committee itself. We did not arrive at the conclusions easily. There are indeed issues which we feel may be advisable in the long term but not at this moment in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 544</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> time at least; for example, maintenance for husbands. I am keeping my mind open about it. Perhaps, who knows, in the next century, the matter may be raised again and we may be better prepared to consider that. But for the moment, let the men maintain their wives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Dr Lee Boon Yang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at Twenty-six\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Minutes to Four o'clock pm\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   to a date to be fixed.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>PURCHASE OF FLATS BY LOWER INCOME FAMILIES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether the Government will increase the grants to lower income families who are first-time applicants to help them purchase 3-room flats either from the Housing and Development Board or the open market. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said in his National Day Rally speech on 18th August 1996 that the Government will continue to spend more time, energy and resources on public housing. He also stressed that public housing will continue to remain affordable and revealed that the Government will do more to help the lower income households to own their flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this, the Minister for National Development has, on 22nd August 1996, explained the four-pronged approach that the Government has put in place to help the lower income households own their flats. The approach comprises: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) sale at discounted prices of 3-room flats, purchased by HDB from the open market; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) sale of 4-room budget flats; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) sale of rental flats to sitting tenants at discounted prices; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) priority allocation of 3 and 4-room flats to HDB rental flat tenants. These measures have so far benefited about 9,700 low income families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also announced additional measures to encourage greater home-ownership among the low-income families: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The discount on the sale prices for 3-room buy-back flats will be increased. At present, these flats are sold at a discount of $40,000. The discount will be raised to $50,000 to enable more low-income families to buy these flats from the HDB; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The household income ceiling for applicants buying 3-room buy-back flats will be raised from $1,200 to $1,500 per month. This will enable more families to apply for the 3-room buy-back flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 545</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>UNIVERSITY ADMISSION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Education whether those who donate generously to the University Endowment Fund should be given some form of priority in university admission. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry does not intend to accord priority of admission to university for donors to the Universities Endowment Fund.

However, where it is technically not possible to provide sufficient parking lots, LTA will have to waive this requirement. If problems with parking arise as a result, LTA will, in consultation with URA, explore turning suitable sites in the vicinity into public carparks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The developments along Balestier Road are normally on small sites presently occupied by a few shophouses. It has been difficult for them to comply with the full parking provision requirements. Through feedback and suggestions from grassroots leaders in the Moulmein CCC, URA opened a new surface car park of 59 lots in May and 15 kerbside lots in August this year to make up for the shortfall in car parking lots. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA surveys showed that the new car parking lots are not well-utilised yet, probably because motorists are not familiar with them. They expect the situation to improve as the new car parks become more well-known to visitors in the area. I will ask the various agencies to monitor the situation closely and take remedial action if necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FAULTY AIDS TEST KITS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Health why faulty test kits for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) were used by clinical laboratories and how these kits got into the market. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The faulty test kit for AIDS referred to by the Member is the Abbott IMx HIV-1/HIV-2 3rd Generation Plus Test manufactured by Abbott of USA for the screening of HIV infection. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbott test kits were approved for use in developed countries like UK, USA and Germany. The fault that was reported in April 1996 of this particular test kit of Abbotts was only detected after millions of tests had been carried out all over the world. According to the manufacturers, only 4 cases of false negatives out of 2.5 million tests shipped to customers worldwide were reported in certain overseas countries.. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This test kit was never used in the Government and restructured hospitals and laboratories. In the private sector, only 11 clinical laboratories have used this since 1st October 1995. All laboratories have since stopped using them from 4th April 1996. The Ministry of Health has issued a press statement on this matter and has recommended that, as a precautionary measure, those who were tested in private clinics or laboratories should go back to the same clinic, laboratory or the referring doctor to check whether they require a retest. The Ministry is monitoring all the retests conducted. So far no false negative results have been found in the retests. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 551</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TRAFFIC AT UPPER SERANGOON ROAD</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether the traffic situation at Upper Serangoon Road has improved since his last visit when he experienced the traffic jams himself. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffic volume along Upper Serangoon Road is high because it is taking in traffic originating from major towns like Hougang, Toa Payoh and Tampines, and also from two major expressways, namely, Central and Pan-Island Expressways. There are several major arterial and ring roads which criss-cross with Upper Serangoon Road at the Boundary Road/Upper Paya Lebar Road junction, the Braddell Road/Bartley Road junction and the Woodsville interchange. This makes the congestion worse. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has been active in seeking solutions to ease the traffic situation at Upper Serangoon Road. In July 1995, the traffic lights along Upper Serangoon Road were computerised, and average travelling speed during the morning and evening peak hours improved by 20% and 13% respectively. The Government will be spending $85 million in the next four years to convert the Paya Lebar Road/Boundary Road and Braddell/Bartley Road junctions into three to fourtier interchanges. This would increase the carrying capacity of the junctions significantly and smoothen the traffic flow along Upper Serangoon Road. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>DIRTYING OF ROADS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. \n  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b> asked the Minister for Communications whether his Ministry is aware that road line-drawing vehicles often dirty the roads by spilling paints while drawing lines on roads and, if so, what measures are being taken to prevent the roads being dirtied by such vehicles. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vehicles used for drawing lines on the roads should not spill any paint on the roads while doing the job. This is as the road-marking paint, called thermoplastic paint, comes in powder form. Vehicles that draw road lines have to be fitted with heating devices to turn the powder into liquid form just before the paint is applied on the roads. Paint marks on the roads are likely to be caused by spillage from trucks carrying normal paints, not road-marking paint. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 553</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LIGHTED SHELTER FOR YISHUN MRT TAXI STATION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. \n  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b> asked the Minister for Communications when will the Land Transport Authority construct a shelter with lights for the Yishun MRT taxi station such as that constructed for the Khatib MRT taxi station. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority has an on-going programme to build covered linkways and other commuter facilities at major transport interchanges.
