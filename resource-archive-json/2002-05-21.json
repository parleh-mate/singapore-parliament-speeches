E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, IDA is now\r\n\r\nexamining  the  pros  and  cons  of  mandating  that   mobile\r\n\r\noperators  switch  from  a Mobile-Party-Pays  (MPP)  charging\r\n\r\nmethod to the Calling-Party-Pays (CPP) regime.  Moving to the\r\n\r\nCPP  system may lower mobile rates.  But, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nfixed line users may have to pay more for calls between fixed-line and mobile users.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deciding which system benefits users more is a complex\r\n\r\nissue.   MITA  is  therefore conducting a  detailed  economic\r\n\r\nanalysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  examine,  among other things, the capital  and  operating\r\n\r\ncosts  involved in implementing the change from MPP  to  CPP,\r\n\r\nhow   the  CPP  charging  system  could  impact  prices  that\r\n\r\nconsumers  pay, the system of inter-operator network  charges\r\n\r\nfor  both  fixed  and  mobile  operators,  and  consumer  and\r\n\r\nindustry behaviour arising from such a change.  We expect  to\r\n\r\nreach a decision by the fourth quarter of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandating a change in the charging method is a serious\r\n\r\nmatter, because it would have a major impact on both industry\r\n\r\nand  consumers.   This was why IDA had,  earlier  this  year,\r\n\r\nconducted  a  public consultation to seek views  on  the  two\r\n\r\ncharging  regimes.  However, only two consumers had responded\r\n\r\nto the public consultation.  IDA is, therefore, conducting  a\r\n\r\nconsumer   survey  to  obtain  more  comprehensive   feedback\r\n\r\ndirectly from mobile phone users, in order to complement  the\r\n\r\nviews obtained from industry in the public consultation.  IDA\r\n\r\nwill  incorporate the survey results and consumer views  into\r\n\r\nits study.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, I am sure the\r\n\r\nMinister is aware that most countries have already opted  for\r\n\r\nthe  CPP system.  Although he has stated that the fixed  line\r\n\r\ncallers  may  end  up  paying more,  is  he  aware  that  the\r\n\r\nexperience in other countries is that, under the CPP  system,\r\n\r\noperators  would  actually come out with a great  variety  of\r\n\r\ncharging plans and thereby offering consumers greater choice,\r\n\r\nwhich in the end actually results in lower prices?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Sir, indeed, a number of other countries\r\n\r\nhave  adopted the CPP system.  In Singapore, the adoption  of\r\n\r\nMPP has not hindered the growth of the industry.  In fact, we\r\n\r\nhave  one  of  the  highest rates of mobile  phone  usage  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Our penetration rate is higher than 70%.  I think\r\n\r\nthe  latest figure shows that it is about 71%.  So  this  has\r\n\r\nnot hindered the growth of the industry.  But for the reasons\r\n\r\nI  cited earlier, switching from one system to the other does\r\n\r\nhave  implications for the marketplace.  So we want  to  take\r\n\r\ntime to study this issue carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><div align=\"center\"><b>FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR</b></div></b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>1ST APRIL, 2002 TO 31ST MARCH, 2003</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Paper Cmd. 3 of 2002)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [6th\r\n\r\nAllotted Day].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head K (cont.) -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question [20th May, 2002],\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the total sum to be allocated for Head K of the\r\n\r\nMain Estimates be reduced by $100.\" - [Dr Wang Kai Yuen].\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Thank you, Sir, for\r\n\r\nallowing me to continue.  Yesterday, I started my speech  and\r\n\r\ngave  my  impression  that  while the  streaming  system  was\r\n\r\nintended to allow each child to learn and progress at his  or\r\n\r\nher  own  pace,  the problem seems to be in implementing  the\r\n\r\nsystem.   For  many reasons, including the  pressure  of  the\r\n\r\nschool  ranking system, schools and principals end up putting\r\n\r\ntheir best resources to focus on the EM1 and EM2 streams,  or\r\n\r\nthe  best  streams in the school system, so that the  overall\r\n\r\ngrades  of  the  school look good.  The end effect  has  been\r\n\r\ndetrimental,  both  in  terms of  the  failure  to  let  late\r\n\r\nbloomers  bloom at all, and in terms of destroying the  self-esteem  of our children at such a young age by putting labels\r\n\r\non them.  The Minister's argument has been that the streaming\r\n\r\nsystem  has  prevented  wastage  and  resulted  in  very  few\r\n\r\nchildren dropping out of the school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest to the Minister that he would\r\n\r\nstill  achieve no dropouts from the education  system  if  he\r\n\r\nallows  every  child to be streamed at the Primary  6  level,\r\n\r\nafter  the PSLE examinations.  There are many ways to skin  a\r\n\r\ncat  -  to borrow a phrase from the Malaysians - and  one  of\r\n\r\nthem  in  the education system is to categorise our  children\r\n\r\nafter  the  PSLE examinations, a bit later, and  send  weaker\r\n\r\nchildren  to  technical schools to pursue a different  route.\r\n\r\nThis  one  change  of streaming children from  Primary  4  to\r\n\r\nPrimary 6 level will satisfy many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who have a major issue with the current system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues I would like the Minister to address are,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  are  there any scientific reasons for  continuously\r\n\r\nstreaming our children at Primary 2, Primary 4, Primary 6 and\r\n\r\nSecondary  2  levels?   Children are moved  every  two  years\r\n\r\ndepending on their academic results.  From what I understand,\r\n\r\nthe  selection  of  the  Primary 4  level  was  an  arbitrary\r\n\r\ndecision  for lack of scientific information, when  the  then\r\n\r\nEducation  Minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, made the  decision  on\r\n\r\nthe  streaming system.  The issues with continuous  streaming\r\n\r\nare:  How  do  we teach children about friendships,  building\r\n\r\nbonds  and  to  help those who have different ability  levels\r\n\r\ncompared to themselves when they are moved constantly?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, can the Ministry do a study on the attitudes\r\n\r\nof  teachers  and students towards EM3 students?   While  the\r\n\r\nintent of streaming is to allow them to progress at different\r\n\r\nlevels,  the real practice is that teachers dread taking  EM3\r\n\r\nclasses  when,  in fact, they should see it as  a  challenge.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that this happens means that the system has not\r\n\r\nbeen able to achieve very good EM3 to EM2 crossovers. Can the\r\n\r\nMinister  share with the House on the success  rate  of  such\r\n\r\ncrossovers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, does the Ministry have a performance target as\r\n\r\nto  how many crossovers it hopes to achieve every year?  Lack\r\n\r\nof  such  performance measures means that there is a lack  of\r\n\r\ninterest to see many more EM3 students making it back to  the\r\n\r\nhigher streams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Ministry wants to take a conservative approach to\r\n\r\nchanging  the system, can we implement a hybrid system  where\r\n\r\nchildren  are  kept  in the same class  and  share  a  common\r\n\r\ncurriculum for most of their contact time, and then break  up\r\n\r\nfor  specific  areas  to  focus, for  children  of  different\r\n\r\nabilities?   Perhaps we can choose a few  schools  with  good\r\n\r\nPSLE track records to experiment with the hybrid system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, in the USA, a new law was passed, called\r\n\r\nthe \"No Child Left Behind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct\"  (NCLB  Act  of  2002).  This Act, among  other  things,\r\n\r\nplaces   important  priority  on  targeting   assistance   to\r\n\r\nsociety's most disadvantaged students in the hope of  closing\r\n\r\nthe  learning divide once and for all.  A learning divide  is\r\n\r\nwhat  our  education system is creating in Singapore,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this is such an important issue that we\r\n\r\nperhaps need a whole day session to debate this issue.  If  I\r\n\r\nask  the  MPs  here to put up their hands as to whether  they\r\n\r\nagree - I would not try it - I think many would not.  I  have\r\n\r\nspoken to many teachers and principals.  Many of them do  not\r\n\r\nagree with this system too, although they are afraid to speak\r\n\r\nup.   Most  Singaporeans  do  not agree  with  the  streaming\r\n\r\nsystem, as it is.  I hope some changes will be made.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, this year, the\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry  has been allocated  the  second  highest\r\n\r\nbudget.  In fact, a total of $6.79 billion has been allocated\r\n\r\nto  the  Education Ministry, which is higher than the  amount\r\n\r\nallocated  in  FY2001.  This is a strong  indication  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's commitment to human capital development.   There\r\n\r\nis no doubt that we have a good education system supported by\r\n\r\na  dedicated  teaching staff and a population that  places  a\r\n\r\nhigh  premium on education as a means to uplift itself.   But\r\n\r\nthen,  Sir,  no  system  is perfect,  and  a  responsive  and\r\n\r\nadaptable  system must take into account the  changing  needs\r\n\r\nand concerns of those that it is designed to serve.  It is in\r\n\r\nthis  light  that  one has to view this  on-going  debate  on\r\n\r\nstreaming.   It is not an indictment of the whole system,  as\r\n\r\nour   overall  educational  framework  is  sound.   But  some\r\n\r\npolicies clearly need some tweaking as we move along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the desired outcomes of the education system,\r\n\r\none  may ask?  As many see it today, it is to feed the labour\r\n\r\nmarket and ensure that everyone has the skill to find a  job.\r\n\r\nThere  is  nothing  wrong  with this  and,  in  fact,  it  is\r\n\r\nsomething which is very necessary if we do not want  to  have\r\n\r\nsocial problems.  Take the example of Malaysia, for instance,\r\n\r\nwhere there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  university graduates with irrelevant degrees  and  hence\r\n\r\nthey cannot find jobs.  But, then, at the same time, there is\r\n\r\nalso  nothing wrong to expect our education system to produce\r\n\r\nbalanced individuals who love education and learning for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  itself and who are capable of independent thinking,\r\n\r\nnot  mere rote learners, and who are very strongly rooted  in\r\n\r\nour  values  as  a society.  The education system  must  also\r\n\r\nprovide a process of learning that is enjoyable and fun.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that many of us remember our own\r\n\r\nchildhood  days  with  fond memories,  the  simple  joys  and\r\n\r\nabandonment  of  growing up.  But what  about  our  children?\r\n\r\nWhat  do  they remember about their childhood - examinations,\r\n\r\nassessment books, supplementary classes and tuition  classes?\r\n\r\nIs  it  right,  one may ask, to put so much pressure  on  our\r\n\r\nchildren at such a young age?  This is precisely what happens\r\n\r\nwith  streaming.  Within a period of six years that he is  in\r\n\r\nprimary  school,  a child will have to go through  two  major\r\n\r\nexaminations - one when he is streamed at Primary 4  and  the\r\n\r\nother  when  he  sits for the PSLE - and the two examinations\r\n\r\nare  very  close to each other.  After a child  has  finished\r\n\r\nmugging for the streaming examinations, he has to immediately\r\n\r\nstart  ramming up in Primary 5 in preparation for  the  PSLE.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder then that in a survey of 1,742 children aged  10\r\n\r\nand  12,  commissioned by SPH last year, students  said  that\r\n\r\nthey  were more afraid of examinations than of their  parents\r\n\r\ndying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also have to ask the question whether it is\r\n\r\nrealistic  for us to assess a child's capabilities and  later\r\n\r\nstream  him  based  only  on the examination  results,  which\r\n\r\nactually measure performance over a very short period of  two\r\n\r\nhours  for each subject.  Based on this, we then decide  that\r\n\r\nthe  child  should go to the fast, the average or  the  slow-learning  track.  Many experts in education are in  agreement\r\n\r\nthat  at the age of 10 years, a child's cognitive skills  are\r\n\r\nnot  fully  developed  yet.  So, is it  reasonable  to  start\r\n\r\nstreaming our children at this age?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of very great concern to parents is the negative\r\n\r\neffect of labelling - EM1, EM2 and EM2, slightly better  than\r\n\r\nthe  old  system  of classifying children  as  being  in  the\r\n\r\nNormal,  Express or Monolingual streams.  But,  nevertheless,\r\n\r\nit  is still streaming.  In those days, if you were a \"Mono\",\r\n\r\nthen  you  are  in deep trouble.  People look  at  you  in  a\r\n\r\ncertain  way  as  if  you  are a  moron  or  doomed  forever.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the labels have changed, the implications  of  this\r\n\r\nlabelling  process remain.  If you are in EM1, you are  first\r\n\r\nclass;  EM2, second class; and EM3, sad to say,  you  are  in\r\n\r\nthird  class.  What is worse is that this labelling could  by\r\n\r\nitself  be  a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Instead of  spurring\r\n\r\nchildren  to greater heights, those labelled EM3  could  very\r\n\r\nwell  say  that they are useless and a failure,  and  nothing\r\n\r\nthat they do can change the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is it fair, reasonable and justifiable to label\r\n\r\nchildren at such a young age, and thereby sowing the seeds of\r\n\r\nelitism and segmentation right from primary school?  Have  we\r\n\r\never considered the impact and damage that such a system will\r\n\r\nhave  on our children's self-esteem and self-confidence, when\r\n\r\nthey are in their crucial years of self-discovery and are  in\r\n\r\nthe  process  of developing emotional and social  anchors  to\r\n\r\nguide them as they grow into adults?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would therefore like to join my other colleagues,\r\n\r\nwho have spoken before me, to ask the Ministry to revisit the\r\n\r\nstreaming  policy.  Please consider doing away with streaming\r\n\r\nat  Primary  4.  The children's examination results  at  PSLE\r\n\r\nare,  in  my  view, sufficient for assessing  our  children's\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and to stream them according to their  results.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if this is not possible ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> 30 seconds, Mdm Halimah.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, I am finishing. Alternatively,\r\n\r\nSir,  if  this  is  not possible, I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider allowing some schools or classes not  to\r\n\r\nhave streaming.  I would also like to ask the Minister to  do\r\n\r\naway  with  the  first class, second class  and  third  class\r\n\r\nlabels\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   EM1,   EM2  and  EM3.   It  has  very  serious  negative\r\n\r\nconnotations and I am not convinced, just like many  parents,\r\n\r\nthat it is good for our society in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I agree with the\r\n\r\nobjective of streaming if it is to maximise the potential and\r\n\r\nability  of  each  individual, develop  his  or  her  special\r\n\r\ntalents and minimise wastage of our education system.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  echo  the  concerns of my hon.  colleagues,  Mdm\r\n\r\nHalimah  and  Mr  Inderjit Singh, on  the  shortfall  of  our\r\n\r\ncurrent streaming system.  As I see it, there are some  areas\r\n\r\nof our current streaming system that must be addressed before\r\n\r\nwe can really achieve the objective we set out to do.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, streaming at Primary 4 is too early, as children\r\n\r\nat  this  age  are  not  fully developed  psychologically  or\r\n\r\nconnectively.  And this is the point that I alluded to during\r\n\r\nthe  debate  on the President's Address, and Mdm Halimah  has\r\n\r\nalso just reiterated the point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, streaming uses only academic results as the\r\n\r\nonly  criteria.   This  fails to  recognise  other  types  of\r\n\r\ntalents  in areas such as sports, arts and music.  If  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  recognise these talents, how can we maximise and develop\r\n\r\nthem?   Is there any surprise that we have not much  luck  in\r\n\r\nachieving sports excellence?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, using academic criteria alone will also result\r\n\r\nin  a  kiasu examination-oriented mentality, and defeats  the\r\n\r\ntrue purpose of education.  It makes study and examination  a\r\n\r\nsource  of stress, just as Mdm Halimah quoted the SPH  survey\r\n\r\nin  2000, that students were more afraid of examinations  and\r\n\r\ntests  than of their parents dying.  I would be very sad  if,\r\n\r\none day, my daughter comes and tells me, \"Dad, I would rather\r\n\r\nyou  die than I fail the examination.\"  Maybe, at that  point\r\n\r\nof time, I would choose to die!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, the present system does not address the need\r\n\r\nof various groups of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstudents  who  do not do well at their streaming examination.\r\n\r\nUnder  the current system, if a student does not do  well  in\r\n\r\nthe examination, he is in EM3.  That is it!  However, we must\r\n\r\nknow  that  children may have done poorly for  a  variety  of\r\n\r\nreasons,  other  than being a slow learner or  of  lower  IQ.\r\n\r\nFirst,  there  may  be a group of students who  are  socially\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged,  such as those who come from broken  families.\r\n\r\nThis group of children would need social intervention to help\r\n\r\nthem,  and  not  a  placement in  EM3.   The  next  group  of\r\n\r\nstudents,  who  may  not  do well, are  those  who  may  have\r\n\r\nlearning  disabilities, such as dyslexia,  and,  again,  they\r\n\r\nneed  special education and not EM3.  The third group may  be\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  just bad luck.  This poor kid  may  be  too\r\n\r\nnervous  and  did  not  do well in the  examination,  or  his\r\n\r\nparents  might  be  quarrelling the night  before,  therefore\r\n\r\naffecting  his mental readiness for examination.  This  group\r\n\r\nof  children need a second chance to sit for the examination,\r\n\r\nand  not  a  placement  in EM3 that labels  him  permanently.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  may  I  urge the Minister to review  the  age  of\r\n\r\nstreaming, and maybe do it at a much later age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should also put in extra efforts to\r\n\r\nidentify the underlying causes of students who do not do well\r\n\r\nin  the streaming - I have stated earlier the reasons for not\r\n\r\ndoing well - and help them accordingly.  Sir, I also urge the\r\n\r\nMinister  to put in appropriate measures to spot and  develop\r\n\r\ntalents in non-academic fields.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, as I have\r\n\r\nanticipated,  what  I wish to say in this House  has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  the subject of much passionate debate.  But the subject\r\n\r\nof  streaming continues to be a cause of so much anguish that\r\n\r\nI  feel it would be morally irresponsible for me not to speak\r\n\r\nup, at the risk of repeating what my colleagues have said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state, at the outset, that I think, overall, we\r\n\r\ndo  have  a good education system, one that is efficient  and\r\n\r\nfocused.   And it has succeeded in producing many generations\r\n\r\nof skilled workers to support our economic thrusts.  It has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplaced  Singapore on the world map as a leader in Mathematics\r\n\r\nand  Science education and the application of IT to learning.\r\n\r\nIt  has  grounded  generations  of  school  children  in  the\r\n\r\nrealities  and  the  joys of multi-racialism  and  harmonious\r\n\r\ncommunal living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 2000, the direction has been towards an ability-driven education to develop and harness the talents of our\r\n\r\nstudents.  But while a differentiated curriculum for students\r\n\r\nto  suit  differing aptitudes is administratively  efficient,\r\n\r\nthe question arises whether the gains to the nation from such\r\n\r\nefficiency is outweighed by the psychological cost  this  has\r\n\r\ninflicted  on Primary 4 10-year olds and their long suffering\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must first give credit where it is due. I know\r\n\r\nof  a  Singaporean mother who has just come back from Germany\r\n\r\nfor her son's education because she feels that the system  in\r\n\r\nGermany  is  the other extreme - too relaxed, no  home  work,\r\n\r\neverything at one's pace, but usually pegged at the speed  of\r\n\r\nthe  slowest child.  Sir, I submit this is not the outcome  I\r\n\r\nwelcome,  as  soon, we, as a nation, may lose our  drive  and\r\n\r\ncompetitive spirit and that is the sure road to perdition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, there is a yawning gap between parents and the\r\n\r\nMOE for all its good and noble intentions.  I believe many in\r\n\r\nthis  House  have  school-going children, or have  interacted\r\n\r\nwith  other parents, and therefore will understand where  the\r\n\r\nstress   point  lies.   At  a  recent  feedback  session   on\r\n\r\nEducation,  the  subject  that occupied  the  most  time  and\r\n\r\nelectrified the atmosphere was, as Members will have  guessed\r\n\r\nit,  streaming.  One participant even objected  to  the  term\r\n\r\n\"gifted children\".  She asked what does that imply about  the\r\n\r\nother children.  Does this mean that they are not gifted?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents say streaming is bad for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nstreaming,  particularly  at the young  age  of  10  years  - Primary  4  - prematurely labels a child as slow,  a  no-hope\r\n\r\ncase and affects his self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt demoralises the child and may make it difficult for him to\r\n\r\nreturn  to mainstream education later on in Express or Normal\r\n\r\n(Academic)  stream.  It disadvantages late bloomers,  causing\r\n\r\nhim to lose opportunities and also causing the system to lose\r\n\r\nwhat  may  have  turned  out to be a brilliant  scientist  or\r\n\r\nentrepreneur.  Einstein, it has been frequently pointed  out,\r\n\r\nwas not exactly a top student in school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, MOE is strongly convinced that streaming is\r\n\r\ngood  for  the  following  reasons:   streaming  allows   our\r\n\r\nchildren  to  learn  at  their  own  pace,  and  not   suffer\r\n\r\nunnecessary  performance-related stress.  The alternative  to\r\n\r\nstreaming,  to  quote  the Minister for  Education  from  the\r\n\r\nBudget 2001 Committee of Supply debate, is that many children\r\n\r\nwill  fail  and they will drop out of school.  No doubt,  MOE\r\n\r\nwill  again furnish more and updated statistics this time  to\r\n\r\nshow the benefits of streaming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am persuaded that there are merits to both sets\r\n\r\nof  arguments.  However, I strongly feel that it is  time  to\r\n\r\nrefine the system, to close this gap between parents and MOE.\r\n\r\nThis  is  especially  critical  when  we  are  committed   to\r\n\r\nmaximising the potential of every Singaporean and  trying  to\r\n\r\nnurture an entrepreneurial spirit in our young. We should not\r\n\r\ndisillusion them by labelling them as no-hope cases at such a\r\n\r\nyoung age.  As noted by the Prime Minister, \"Morale is a very\r\n\r\nimportant thing.  If we feel demoralised, then we are not  in\r\n\r\nthe mood to fight competitively.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister if there are plans\r\n\r\nto  review and modify the current system to mitigate some  of\r\n\r\nthese concerns.  For a start, may I suggest that the Ministry\r\n\r\nassure  parents  that  as much attention,  if  not  more,  is\r\n\r\nfocused   on  these  \"laggard\"  children  to  develop   their\r\n\r\npotential as for the other cohorts.  The successes  of  these\r\n\r\nchildren  should be celebrated as much, if not more than  the\r\n\r\nothers,  so that parents' concerns are mitigated and children\r\n\r\nassured that there are many roads to success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like my parliamentary colleagues before me, I would\r\n\r\nlike to urge the Ministry to heed the call to send all cows\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  vets, for surely this cow needs a thorough  check-up\r\n\r\nand medication, if not a worse fate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, with the world\r\n\r\nchanging  at  a  fast  pace  to  one  that  requires   future\r\n\r\ngenerations to have critical, creative and innovative  minds,\r\n\r\nthere  is  indeed a danger of our young getting lost  in  our\r\n\r\nnation  building process.  I therefore believe it  is  timely\r\n\r\nnow  that  the  Ministry of Education  review  the  streaming\r\n\r\nsystem.   There are side effects about streaming of  students\r\n\r\nunder the current education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, by categorising our young into\r\n\r\nacademically enumerated groupings, this reinforces  the  view\r\n\r\nthat  only  children  who  are academically  intelligent  are\r\n\r\nvaluable   and   relevant  assets  of  the   future.    Those\r\n\r\nindividuals  who  are talented in other  aspects,  be  it  in\r\n\r\nsports or music, etc, seem to have no niche in this streaming\r\n\r\nsystem.   Although the recent announcement of setting  up  of\r\n\r\nthe speciality school can address these problems somewhat,  I\r\n\r\nam of the view that the streaming system should be changed to\r\n\r\nbetter  reflect  the  emphasis on individual  capability  and\r\n\r\ntalent in areas other than just academia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, nation building means coagulating a diverse\r\n\r\npopulation  into one entity.  The streaming system  does  not\r\n\r\nencourage  the  recognition and toleration  of  diversity  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  talents  and capabilities.  The  streaming  system\r\n\r\nsuggests  that  we  are judged purely in  terms  of  academic\r\n\r\nperformance.  In other words, only the academically sound are\r\n\r\ndeemed  working  to  be  our best pillars  of  tomorrow.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  not  all those in the best stream eventually  become\r\n\r\nleaders, and neither will those in the lower stream  fall  by\r\n\r\nthe  wayside.  But, as a general trend, what I have suggested\r\n\r\n-   that the system has inculcated important values which,  I\r\n\r\nemphasise again, are academic capabilities  -  is valid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, although the purpose of streaming is to\r\n\r\nhelp an individual student to develop his or her potential to\r\n\r\nthe fullest, by being able to study in his or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nher  own  pace, the question is whether streaming  itself  is\r\n\r\neffective enough to develop a child's potential.  Earlier,  I\r\n\r\nhave mentioned that streaming will reinforce academic ability\r\n\r\nas  the  only  criterion for judging students.  However,  the\r\n\r\nquestion is: what exactly constitutes academic ability?  Some\r\n\r\nchildren  are  better with their mathematical  understanding,\r\n\r\nsome better with Science, and some are better with languages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current streaming system streams in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe   cluster  of  subjects  and  determination  of  academic\r\n\r\nability, in totality, in the cluster.  Such a system fails to\r\n\r\ntake   into  account  the  relative  strengths  and  relative\r\n\r\ninterests  of each student based on the individual  subjects.\r\n\r\nThis is even more jarring at the Secondary 2 and Secondary  3\r\n\r\nlevels.   For example, a non-Pure Science Express stream,  or\r\n\r\nnon-Express  stream student, is likely to  face  a  situation\r\n\r\nthat  his interest in reading individual Pure Science module,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Biology,  might be hampered  as  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nstreaming.   Also,  for that matter, a Pure Science  streamed\r\n\r\nstudent  might never have the opportunity to pursue technical\r\n\r\nstudies, or arts subject at the \"O\" level, as a result of the\r\n\r\nstreaming.   This  is  because the current  streaming  system\r\n\r\nassumes  that  students streamed to a particular  stream  are\r\n\r\nnaturally more inclined to certain subjects offered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore ask the Ministry to consider exploring\r\n\r\nthe idea of organising schools based on subjects.  This means\r\n\r\nscrapping the current streaming system based on a cluster  of\r\n\r\nsubjects  and  replacing it with a system based on  subjects.\r\n\r\nStudents would be grouped into different classes based on the\r\n\r\nmerit  of  their individual subject.  Although  it  could  be\r\n\r\nargued  that this is still a form of streaming,   I  am  sure\r\n\r\nsuch  a  system of allowing individual students to  learn  at\r\n\r\ntheir  own  pace is more progressive and is likely to  lessen\r\n\r\nsocial  stigma.   This  is not to say  that  schools  are  to\r\n\r\nabandon  the  idea of all-rounded education, but  rather  the\r\n\r\nmain  thrust  of the proposal here is the acceptance  of  the\r\n\r\nfact   that  different  students  have  different  strengths.\r\n\r\nHence, there must be avenues, opportunities and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecognition available to allow individual student to  \"major\"\r\n\r\nin  what  he  or  she  loves.   To  allow  the  above  to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented, there must be a total revamp, in terms of entire\r\n\r\neducation  process,  such as grading,  protocol,  examination\r\n\r\nsystems,  admission  requirements, etc, to  support  the  new\r\n\r\neducation   system   paradigm.   I  do  not   have   specific\r\n\r\nrecommendations  for  the various components,  which  require\r\n\r\nfurther in-depth studies and analysis for more details.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of streaming in schools, ie, allowing children  to\r\n\r\nstudy  at their own pace and capabilities.  However, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  appeal  to  the Ministry to look  at  the  parents'\r\n\r\nconcern.   Streaming  is  not  only  at  Primary  4.   I  see\r\n\r\nstreaming is done at every year of study.  At Primary 5, if a\r\n\r\nstudent does not do well, he will have to slide down  to  EM2\r\n\r\nor  EM3.  This is similarly done in Secondary 1, Secondary  2\r\n\r\nand  Secondary 3.  If the students do not do well, they slide\r\n\r\ndown  to  the Normal stream.  Why do we need to do  streaming\r\n\r\neach year?  I would like to propose to do away with streaming\r\n\r\nat  each  year  as, in the present system, the  students  are\r\n\r\nalready  streamed  and their capability of study  at  certain\r\n\r\nintervals,  after  Primary 6 and at  Secondary  4.   The  two\r\n\r\nstages  at  Primary 4 and Secondary 2 should just be  subject\r\n\r\ncombinations based on the language capability and interest of\r\n\r\neach  child.   Remove the threat that goes with each  student\r\n\r\nthe  possibility of sliding down to the lower stream at  each\r\n\r\nyear.   We  should  allow a more flexible stream,  give  more\r\n\r\nspace  and  time for the children and the parents in  between\r\n\r\nthe  years, ie, before the major examinations of PSLE and GCE\r\n\r\n'O' Level, to explore and have fun in their studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have included the parents, as I know most parents are\r\n\r\nstudying alongside with their children in Singapore.   I  did\r\n\r\nanother  Primary 6 three years ago.  The rush by  parents  to\r\n\r\napply for annual leave\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbefore  each examination is a common phenomenon.  I  used  to\r\n\r\nhave female colleagues coming to apply for leave, but now  we\r\n\r\nsee increasingly more male colleagues coming forward to apply\r\n\r\ntoo - a good sign for the ladies in terms of joint parenting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument is always that the students are allowed to\r\n\r\njump  into  the  upper  stream if they  do  well.   How  many\r\n\r\nstudents, after being shot at the body, face and heart, would\r\n\r\nbe  able  to swim well in the upper stream, which requires  a\r\n\r\nfaster  pace and energy?  I chose the face as \"mien  zi\"  and\r\n\r\nthe  heart  as  confidence.  At the age of  10-15,  face  and\r\n\r\nconfidence  are very important to them.  I sincerely  believe\r\n\r\nthat if the children are motivated with confidence and pride,\r\n\r\nthey would be able to do well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are our principals so concerned and keen to put the\r\n\r\nchild  in the lower stream?  Is it the ranking of schools  or\r\n\r\nthe  actual belief that the child will be better off  in  the\r\n\r\nlower stream and could perform better?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next topic is on ranking of good performing schools.\r\n\r\nI  sincerely appeal to the Ministry to remove the ranking  of\r\n\r\ngood performing schools.  What is the purpose of ranking?  To\r\n\r\nmotivate the schools to perform better?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take two schools, RI and a neighbourhood school,\r\n\r\neg, First Toa Payoh Secondary School.  The assumption is that\r\n\r\nwe  use  the RI infrastructure - creative and flexible course\r\n\r\ncontent, the support finances and the best-qualified teachers\r\n\r\navailable.  Can First Toa Payoh Secondary School be  able  to\r\n\r\nbe  RI,  if it accepts students from the top 1% of  the  PSLE\r\n\r\ncohort  with a score of at least 260 points and above?   Yes.\r\n\r\nI  believe  most  of  us  would agree that  First  Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nSecondary  School  would rank among the top  schools  without\r\n\r\nmuch  effort.  Would RI then become First Toa Payoh Secondary\r\n\r\nSchool,  a  neighbourhood school, if they accept students  at\r\n\r\n<br><br>180&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSLE  scores and above?  RI may not be First  Toa  Payoh\r\n\r\nSecondary  School but would move higher in the ranking,  say,\r\n\r\nperhaps to that of Sin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMing   Secondary   School,  which  is  a  better   performing\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  school.   This  is  in  view  of   our   basic\r\n\r\nassumption of using RI's support infrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most schools serve different levels of students. We are\r\n\r\nranking   the   schools  with  different  fundamentals,   eg,\r\n\r\ncomparing Fuji apples with Australian apples.  Both are still\r\n\r\napples  from the external look, but the taste and crunchiness\r\n\r\nare  very  different.  Most schools would want to become  the\r\n\r\ntop 20 schools to attract the top students of the cohort.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  cycle.   The schools which want to be ranked  high  to\r\n\r\nattract  high-calibre students would have to perform well  in\r\n\r\nthe  assessment  statistics.  For most of  the  schools,  the\r\n\r\nexcuse  is  that  the students would perform  better  in  the\r\n\r\nNormal  stream  if  they have students who fill  the  Express\r\n\r\nstream, but the school does not have a class.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mdm Phua, can you start winding up your\r\n\r\nspeech, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Why not have the time to nurture\r\n\r\nthese  students, as I understand that there  is  currently  a\r\n\r\nsoftware that could even predict a child's performance, based\r\n\r\non PSLE scores?

The maximum curricula  in\r\n\r\nthe  name of maximising each child's potential may jeopardise\r\n\r\ninnovative  skills and creativity in our children,  which  we\r\n\r\nare  trying  to promote.  Today, I would like to beseech  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  to  regard  our  students  not  just\r\n\r\nacademically  but  in totality, especially the  mental  well-being of our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, psychiatrists at the Institute of Mental\r\n\r\nHealth  saw  14,000 children.  This could be the tip  of  the\r\n\r\nstress  iceberg, as psychiatric conditions are still a stigma\r\n\r\nto  many, and many parents do not realise their children need\r\n\r\npsychiatric help.  Suicides accounted for 2.2% of all  deaths\r\n\r\nin  2000.   6% occurred among the 10-19 age group.   Although\r\n\r\nthe death rate from suicides has fallen in the past 20 years,\r\n\r\nsuicides for the 10-19 age group have not fallen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy syllabus, too much homework, enrichment\r\n\r\nprogrammes, assessments and examinations have been  cited  as\r\n\r\nthe cause of stress.  Some stress can be useful and positive,\r\n\r\nbut  this is only up to a certain optimal level, beyond which\r\n\r\na  person's performance will deteriorate and may even end  up\r\n\r\nwith  a  breakdown.   May  I ask the Minister  for  Education\r\n\r\nwhether  studies have been done to look into  this  and  what\r\n\r\nsteps  his Ministry would take to rectify policies  that  are\r\n\r\ncausative factors of stress in our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers who are the surrogate parents during most of\r\n\r\nthe  day  should  try to care for the students  in  totality.\r\n\r\nThey  should  be  alert  to pick up  those  in  psychological\r\n\r\nanguish and refer them for help if necessary.  Early referral\r\n\r\nto  counsellors and doctors will help the students  de-stress\r\n\r\nand cope better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Streaming in schools and ranking of schools stress\r\n\r\nparents.  The students, in turn, feel their stress.  This has\r\n\r\nto be addressed accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;School starting time should be at 8.30 am instead of\r\n\r\n<br>7.00 am presently. Many children have to get up at wee hours\r\n\r\nof  the morning, especially for those who need to travel  far\r\n\r\nfrom their homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classroom learning should be made as interesting as\r\n\r\npossible, with technical aids whenever possible to facilitate\r\n\r\nlearning for students.  This will make learning fun and  less\r\n\r\nstressful.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, there has been a downward trend\r\n\r\nin the number of students who drop out of school.  At the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprimary  level,  the number fell from 1,022 or  2.5%  of  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  1  cohort in 1998, to 183 or 0.4% in 1999.   At  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  level, it fell from 1,844 or 4.3% of  the  primary\r\n\r\ncohort to 1,400 or 3.5% over the same period.  We should view\r\n\r\nstudent  drop-out rates with a great deal of concern,  as  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  those who drop out will face serious difficulties\r\n\r\nfinding decent jobs or fitting into our society, and will  be\r\n\r\ntrapped in a vicious cycle of poverty.  If, on average, 2,000\r\n\r\nchildren drop out of school every year, there will be  20,000\r\n\r\nin  10 years who will join the pool of the unskilled, and  we\r\n\r\nwill  then have to put in a lot more resources to remedy  the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the statistics, I notice that most drop-out\r\n\r\ncases occur at Primary 6 and at Secondary 3.  To me, this  is\r\n\r\nsignificant  as  it  indicates that part of  the  problem  is\r\n\r\nbecause of the serious difficulties that they face in  coping\r\n\r\nwith major examinations, such as PSLE and GCE O-level.  So  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister what measures are currently in\r\n\r\nplace  to  help such students and prevent them from  dropping\r\n\r\nout, and how effective are these measures?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also know that in most cases, the problems are deep-rooted, such as dysfunctional families, poor foundation or\r\n\r\nnegative peer influence.  So the programmes that are  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  must be multi-pronged to reach out to the families  as\r\n\r\nwell.   Better,  in my view, to devote more resources  before\r\n\r\nthey drop out, rather than have the problems compounded later\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister what follow-up action has been taken to bring drop-outs back to school,\r\n\r\nand how successful has the MOE been in this effort?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nJack Neo movie \"I Not Stupid\" was a big hit.

But, through their interactions with their\r\n\r\nfriends and family, we come to see the pressures children and\r\n\r\nadults  face  everyday.   Many  parents  who  saw  the  movie\r\n\r\nidentified with the pressures that their own children face in\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, one of the most emotional scenes of the movie\r\n\r\nwas  when  Kok Pin, the under-performing student,  wanted  to\r\n\r\ncommit  suicide  because  he could  not  cope  with  academic\r\n\r\npressures.  It may be an isolated and extreme example, but it\r\n\r\nhas happened in real life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are these pressures real? Sir, the Far Eastern Economic\r\n\r\nReview of 9th August 2001 reported that in the year 2000, our\r\n\r\nnumber of new cases of young people visiting psychiatrists at\r\n\r\nGovernment  clinics  was 2,491, and  half  were  of   primary\r\n\r\nschool age.  The number has doubled compared to 1990.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can be done to help ease the pressure on students\r\n\r\nin  schools?  There are no easy answers.  But the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation must monitor the situation very closely.   We  must\r\n\r\nnot  wait  for  any more actual and tragic  cases  to  happen\r\n\r\nbefore we spring into action.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, we have\r\n\r\ndebated  on legislation to protect our children from parental\r\n\r\nabuse, to protect them against child labour, etc.  Maybe, one\r\n\r\nday,  we  will  need  a  legislation  to  protect  them  from\r\n\r\nexcessive pressure and stress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our children do face stress from many directions.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  they face stress from their schools.  Teachers  and\r\n\r\nprincipals  are  mindful  of the results  of  their  schools,\r\n\r\nbecause  they are ranked every year based on the  performance\r\n\r\nof  their students.  I believe that some pressure is good  to\r\n\r\npush  the  children  to  go  an extra  mile.   But  excessive\r\n\r\npressure may push them over the limits.  I would like to urge\r\n\r\nthe Minister to consider replacing the current school ranking\r\n\r\nsystem  with  the  banding system.  The  ranking  system  has\r\n\r\ncreated substantial tension among the schools as they compete\r\n\r\nwith one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother.   I  believe that the banding system will  ease  the\r\n\r\npressure  on  the schools and, in turn, ease the pressure  on\r\n\r\nthe  students,  while  still having  sufficient  pressure  to\r\n\r\nencourage the schools and the students to do their best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our children face pressure from their parents.\r\n\r\nMany  young parents today want their children to do  well  in\r\n\r\nthe  schools, yet they spend little time with their  children\r\n\r\nbecause, very often, both parents are working.  They can only\r\n\r\nsend  their  kids to the best tuition classes and  hope  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  outperform  their  neighbour's  kids.   This   is\r\n\r\nparticularly prevalent in the streaming year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have spoken about streaming and I would not\r\n\r\nbelabour this point.  However, I would like to point out that\r\n\r\nit  is true that streaming has created stress.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  request the Ministry to be open to alternative  ways  and\r\n\r\nexplore  some of these to see if it could be done  with  less\r\n\r\nstress  on  the  students.  In this regard, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nvolunteer  myself  to  participate  in  any  review  of   the\r\n\r\nstreaming exercise, and explore alternatives to see if we can\r\n\r\nhelp our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area of stress comes from the students\r\n\r\nthemselves, from their own desire to do well.  This is  good.\r\n\r\nHowever,  when their results are not up to their expectations\r\n\r\nor  the expectations of their parents, some of them may  have\r\n\r\nproblem  coping.  In this regard, psychological and emotional\r\n\r\nsupport for the students is most critical to help them  cope.\r\n\r\nI believe that the problems faced by students are often multi-faceted.   It may involve parental problems or problems  with\r\n\r\ntheir siblings.  Sometimes, it may involve financial problems\r\n\r\nat home or others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I feel that it is crucial to provide a\r\n\r\nholistic,  psychological and emotional support  that  may  be\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  capability of the non-professional  counsellors.\r\n\r\nHence,  I  would  like to ask the Minister  whether  he  will\r\n\r\nconsider  providing the schools with funds so that  they  are\r\n\r\nable  to  engage professional counsellors rather than retired\r\n\r\nteachers or, better still, allow them to tie up directly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  professional organisations, such as the Family  Service\r\n\r\nCentres,  to  provide  professional and holistic  counselling\r\n\r\nservices  to the students and, sometimes, to the  parents  of\r\n\r\nthe  students.   This will also help ease  the  load  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers, who should really focus on teaching.  Direct  link-up  between  the  schools and the professional  organisations\r\n\r\nwill also help build up rapport and enhance the effectiveness\r\n\r\nof  the  support  provider.  They can also become  more  pro-active  in  helping the school to identify students  who  are\r\n\r\npotentially at risk, so that problems can be dealt with at an\r\n\r\nearly stage.\r\n\r\nSir,  once again, children are precious, and all of  us  will\r\n\r\nagree  that  we  must  remake  our  education  system,  where\r\n\r\nnecessary,  to ensure that our children can grow  up  with  a\r\n\r\nbalanced character.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister will take these suggestions\r\n\r\ninto  consideration and, hopefully, we will not see  the  day\r\n\r\nwhere  we  need  to  introduce a Bill on  protection  of  our\r\n\r\nchildren against stress and pressure.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, along the line of my colleague\r\n\r\nwho  spoke earlier, I would also like to ask for a review  of\r\n\r\nthe  existing  system  of  providing counselling  service  in\r\n\r\nschools,  which is currently quite ad-hoc.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that a more formal arrangement be put in place  where\r\n\r\na  trained counsellor is employed by schools or a cluster  of\r\n\r\nschools for the following reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, MOE has said that its education system is\r\n\r\ncapability-driven.   This  means  that   it   is   now   more\r\n\r\nindividualised,  more  suited  to  the  capability  of   each\r\n\r\nstudent.   If  we are moving towards this kind  of  education\r\n\r\nsystem,   there   is,   therefore,   a   greater   need   for\r\n\r\nindividualised  care.  The task of a professional  counsellor\r\n\r\ncould  be  to  help students manage the problems  of  stress,\r\n\r\ncoping with school work, relations with peers and even career\r\n\r\ncounselling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, students today need more emotional and\r\n\r\npsychological  support,  as  they  are  faced  with  multiple\r\n\r\npressures and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  development  process  has become  more  challenging.   A\r\n\r\nrecent newspaper report mentioned that the number of children\r\n\r\nseeking the help of psychiatrists has increased three-fold in\r\n\r\nover  eight  years.  The number had increased from  5,600  in\r\n\r\n1990 to 20,000 in 1998, and this is based on the Institute of\r\n\r\nHealth Child Psychiatric Clinic figures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the problems faced are anxiety disorders and\r\n\r\nbehavourial  problems  which  range  from  fear  of  schools,\r\n\r\nexaminations  and, worst of all, failure.  In  view  of  this\r\n\r\nincreased  pressure  on  our students,  the  present  ad  hoc\r\n\r\napproach  where teachers end up as counsellors is inadequate.\r\n\r\nTeachers  are faced with tremendous time pressures themselves\r\n\r\nto   complete  the  syllabus  and  meet  certain  performance\r\n\r\nstandards.  It is, therefore, not practical to expect them to\r\n\r\nassume more and more non-teaching responsibilities.  Also,  a\r\n\r\nrecent  report in the newspapers involving a school principal\r\n\r\nshows  that  there  are  risks if teachers  are  involved  in\r\n\r\ncounselling, as they are not professionals and thus  are  not\r\n\r\ntrained on how to handle students in counselling sessions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, as the\r\n\r\neducation system evolves and matures, I am confident that  it\r\n\r\nwill  continue to offer to our citizens the best options  and\r\n\r\nservices  to  learning  and training.  Similarly,  the  rapid\r\n\r\nchanges in the economy and the world stage also pose a myriad\r\n\r\nof challenges to our students and parents alike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, through the many interactions that I had with\r\n\r\nstudents  and parents, I have noted that they need assistance\r\n\r\nin   many   non-academic  areas  like   career   and   course\r\n\r\ncounselling,  discipline  and  also  personal  problems.   In\r\n\r\nreality,  our  students are put under a lot of  stress  on  a\r\n\r\ndaily basis.  The majority is able to cope, but more and more\r\n\r\nare  facing  difficulties.  These difficulties are manifested\r\n\r\nin  the  form  of discipline and personal problems.   To  top\r\n\r\nthis,  many  parents are also clueless on the  ways  to  help\r\n\r\ntheir children and the avenues to turn to for help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I would like to propose that the\r\n\r\nMinistry allocate the resources to address the need for  more\r\n\r\nqualified counsellors. I am aware that schools have some form\r\n\r\nof  pastoral programme, but I believe this is not sufficient.\r\n\r\nWe  should avoid resorting to ad hoc and short cuts by  using\r\n\r\nteachers  as  counsellors, but rather strategically  plan  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  pool  of qualified and trained  professionals.\r\n\r\nOur students and parents deserve better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my recent visits to the schools in my constituency\r\n\r\nand  through my discussion with the staff, I gather that  the\r\n\r\nstudents and schools could do with some structured assistance\r\n\r\nin this area.  May I propose that the Ministry assigns one or\r\n\r\ntwo professional counsellors for each school cluster?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report in the newspapers on 16th May 2002 concerning\r\n\r\nthe  complications  as  a  result of misunderstanding  during\r\n\r\ncounselling  further illustrates the complexity of  the  job,\r\n\r\nand  also  the acute shortage of these professionals  in  the\r\n\r\nschool   system.   The  educational  institutions  need   the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  MOE  in  this matter.   I  hope  to  get  the\r\n\r\nMinister's position and plan on this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, in this House, we recognise that\r\n\r\nin   Asian  families,  man  is  still  responsible  for   the\r\n\r\nhousehold.  Hence, woman is denied the medical fees  for  her\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we are talking about Asian families. Most\r\n\r\nparents  would  not come forward to seek help for  themselves\r\n\r\nand their children unless the situation is very serious.   We\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  urge  the Ministry to look  into  preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures to spot high-risk students at a young age and  given\r\n\r\nthe  resources,  to  closely guide them through  the  crucial\r\n\r\nyears  of ages 10-15.  We need to help these children  before\r\n\r\nthey are irrevocably sucked into a life-time of problems, and\r\n\r\neven crimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose three recommendations:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A preventive screening of children at age 9. This\r\n\r\nis at the age when children are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nable to understand and be aware of the situation at home  and\r\n\r\nin  school.  They would also have not lost their innocence in\r\n\r\ntelling  the  truth or become too conscious of  their  family\r\n\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Have qualified full-time counsellors in the\r\n\r\nschools.  We understand from the Senior Minister of State, Mr\r\n\r\nTharman,  in his reply speech to Mr Gan Kim Yong's questions,\r\n\r\nthat  there are two trained teachers in counselling.  I would\r\n\r\nstill like to urge for full-time qualified counsellors in the\r\n\r\nschools.   Counselling needs a lot of time and  intervention,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  seeking family support  for  these  high-risk\r\n\r\nchildren, and requires a lot of effort and visitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides counselling, I am also advocating for these high-risk children to have supervised care. In most of these\r\n\r\nfunctional  families,  the parents are  caught  within  their\r\n\r\nproblems,  and  they have no time to support their  children.\r\n\r\nThe  children,  unable  to defend themselves,  would  usually\r\n\r\nsuffer  in silence until they find their own form of outlets.\r\n\r\nWe  should have a supervised student care programme  for  our\r\n\r\nstudents.  It could be on a cluster basis, a support for  the\r\n\r\nchildren, as well as the parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Ministry to give more support\r\n\r\nto our primary and secondary students in view of the fast and\r\n\r\nintense  pace  of our education system.  As the British  Home\r\n\r\nSecretary, David Blunkett, was recently succinctly quoted  as\r\n\r\nsaying  in  a Straits Times article titled \"Criminals.   Spot\r\n\r\nthem  at  age 3\",  \"Instead of trying to pick up  the  pieces\r\n\r\nwhen  things  go wrong, it makes a lot more sense  to  invest\r\n\r\nresources in prevention.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, in the IT\r\n\r\nvision unveiled by the Education Ministry several years  ago,\r\n\r\nall  schools are to be equipped with a student computer ratio\r\n\r\n2:1  by the year 2002.  We are now in 2002, and I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the Minister for Education how well this  target  is\r\n\r\nbeing met, in view of the importance of computer literacy  in\r\n\r\ntoday's  globalised  world. Also, Sir,  there  is  a  natural\r\n\r\nexpectation for students to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconversant and proficient in the use of computers when  these\r\n\r\nstudents enter into institutions of higher learning, such  as\r\n\r\nthe polytechnics and the universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as part of the overall IT vision, I understand\r\n\r\nmany  schools have introduced computer-based home and project\r\n\r\nassignments.  While  this  is laudable,  my  concern  is  for\r\n\r\nstudents  in the low-income group who cannot afford  to  have\r\n\r\ncomputers in their home environment.  Some low-income parents\r\n\r\nhave  expressed worry about their children losing out to  the\r\n\r\nmany  students  who have ready access to computers  at  home,\r\n\r\nwhile  their  children are deprived from such access.   Their\r\n\r\nconcern primarily stems from such home assignments which form\r\n\r\npart of the year-end assessments and examinations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know whether the Education Ministry\r\n\r\nis directing schools to have supplementary classes for school\r\n\r\nchildren  in  the low-income category, and whether  they  are\r\n\r\npermitted to complete such computer-based projects in  school\r\n\r\noutside of their normal curriculum hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> First,\r\n\r\nlet  me  thank  Members  for  contributing  their  views  and\r\n\r\nsuggestions  to improve our education system.   Allow  me  to\r\n\r\nstart with a broad overview of the progress we have made, and\r\n\r\nwhere  we  are  headed, in order to place this discussion  on\r\n\r\neducation within the larger context of what we are working to\r\n\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been done over the last five years. We have\r\n\r\nmoved  the  school  system forward in a  number  of  critical\r\n\r\nareas,  including major enhancements to the teaching  service\r\n\r\nthrough EduPac, trimming the curriculum to allow more time to\r\n\r\ndevelop   creativity   and  thinking  skills,   strengthening\r\n\r\ncitizenship  and values education, devolving  more  authority\r\n\r\nand  responsibility to schools and school clusters,  renewing\r\n\r\nour  school  buildings,  and  introducing  IT  into  all  our\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad has just asked for an update on the IT\r\n\r\nMasterplan.  The Ministry is completing its evaluation on the\r\n\r\ncurrent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMasterplan  which is nearing completion  -  it has  been  5-6\r\n\r\nyears   -   and will unveil its second IT Masterplan for  the\r\n\r\nperiod  2003-2007 in a few months' time.  So,  I  request  Mr\r\n\r\nMagad  to be just a little patient.  When we wrap it all  up,\r\n\r\nwe will give him a full report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have made much progress, but the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  is  not  resting on its laurels,  and  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House  would not  allow  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation to do so.  Dr Wang has suggested that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nshould   leave  no  stone  unturned.   Indeed,  the  previous\r\n\r\nimprovements I have enumerated have merely been  made  within\r\n\r\nthe  existing structure of the education system.   And  going\r\n\r\nforward, our emphasis would be on structural issues.  We will\r\n\r\nlook  at what structures in the education system may need  to\r\n\r\nbe  changed.  The major thrusts in the coming years would be,\r\n\r\nfirst,  the review of the upper secondary and junior  college\r\n\r\nsector;  and  second,  the restructuring  of  the  university\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will consider a new JC curriculum, better integrated\r\n\r\nupper    secondary    and    JC    programmes,    alternative\r\n\r\nqualifications, and private schools at the secondary  and  JC\r\n\r\nlevels.  We will also consider specialised schools in Science\r\n\r\nand  Mathematics,  and in the arts, like the  sports  school,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  cater to students with different  aptitudes  and\r\n\r\ninterest,  as  Mr  Low desires.  At the tertiary  level,  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts  and  the  La\r\n\r\nSalle-SIA  College  of the Arts, funded by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation,  as  well  as  the  establishment  of  the   Music\r\n\r\nConservatory in NUS will provide more opportunities for those\r\n\r\nwith   the   talent  and  interest  in  these   areas.    The\r\n\r\npolytechnics  and ITE will continue to expand,  and  we  will\r\n\r\nalso  provide more university places in the relevant  fields,\r\n\r\nand   also   possibly  allow  private  universities   to   be\r\n\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, these initiatives will provide more\r\n\r\nopportunities  and  options  to our  students  at  the  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary and tertiary levels, building on a very strong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfoundation which we have today, providing a good solid  basic\r\n\r\neducation  to  our  children  in our  primary  and  secondary\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address some of the specific issues that\r\n\r\nMembers have raised. First, streaming.  First of all, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank  Members for agreeing with the  principle  of\r\n\r\nstreaming.   Streaming provides opportunities for educational\r\n\r\nadvancement to all students according to their aptitudes  and\r\n\r\nabilities.  It is not that we have not tried a system without\r\n\r\nstreaming before.  That was a system I grew up in,  and  also\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  Members of this House.   But  that  left  many\r\n\r\nmembers  of our society by the wayside, and that  is  why  we\r\n\r\nhave,  today,  such a large problem in the age group,  40-50,\r\n\r\nwho have not completed their secondary education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our streaming differentiates curriculum and the pace and\r\n\r\nmethod  of learning, so that each student can proceed at  his\r\n\r\nor  her  own  pace  and  gain  a  sense  of  achievement  and\r\n\r\nmotivation  to learn.  Members have emphasised the  need  for\r\n\r\nthe  education  system  to  maximise  the  potential  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents.  This is precisely what streaming attempts  to  do.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the strength our system has, and is a major  reason\r\n\r\nfor the high achievement levels of our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alternative to streaming is mixed ability classes,\r\n\r\nwhere  teaching  has to be targeted at the average.  In  such\r\n\r\nclasses,  the  more academically able will languish  as  they\r\n\r\nlose  interest in the curriculum, while the less academically\r\n\r\nable  students  give up, as they cannot keep  pace  with  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   This  was  what  we  found  previously   before\r\n\r\nstreaming was introduced.  There is a tendency for us to look\r\n\r\nback in history with rose tinted glasses.  We should take  an\r\n\r\nobjective  look and see whether we are doing better  for  the\r\n\r\nbroad majority of our students today than we did in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah has asked how we address the issue of school\r\n\r\ndropouts.   We do so by trying to make sure that  as  few  of\r\n\r\nthem do so as possible in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough  streaming  and giving those who need  it  a  lighter\r\n\r\ncurriculum or more time, we have reduced educational  wastage\r\n\r\nand  successfully  raised the educational attainment  of  our\r\n\r\nstudents.  In 1980, before streaming was introduced, only 58%\r\n\r\nof  our Primary 1 cohort completed secondary school.  By last\r\n\r\nyear, the proportion had gone up to 93%.  This is because  we\r\n\r\nhave been able to provide a differentiated curriculum for the\r\n\r\nstudents.   Through streaming, we have, therefore, been  able\r\n\r\nto  sharply reduce dropout rates due to educational  reasons.\r\n\r\nStudents may still drop out for a variety of personal, family\r\n\r\nor social reasons. To address this, we work with the VWOs and\r\n\r\nMCDS.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the best indicator of the success of streaming\r\n\r\nis  how  well  it  has served our less academically  inclined\r\n\r\nstudents.    Prior   to  the  streaming   system,   and   the\r\n\r\narticulation of the EM3, normal technical stream and ITE,  we\r\n\r\nreally  had  very few educational opportunities for  students\r\n\r\nlike  these.   They would drop out of school  and  enter  the\r\n\r\nworkforce with no specific skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, we introduced the Normal (Technical) course in\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools.  These students did  not  use  to  go  to\r\n\r\nsecondary schools.  They would go to primary school, spend  a\r\n\r\nfew  extra  years in primary schools as over-sized  students,\r\n\r\nand then go on to VITB.  Those pupils who will do better in a\r\n\r\npractical  rather than academic setting, who previously  went\r\n\r\nto  VITB  after  Primary 6, now have a chance  to  shoot  for\r\n\r\nsecondary  education, to develop the foundation for acquiring\r\n\r\na  higher  level  of  skills  at  the  post-secondary  level.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we upgraded the VITB and restructured  it  to\r\n\r\nbecome a post-secondary institution, the ITE, to provide such\r\n\r\nstudents   with  further  post-secondary  opportunities   for\r\n\r\neducation.   This  has lifted the level  of  these  students.\r\n\r\nWith the expansion of places at junior colleges, polytechnics\r\n\r\nand  ITEs,  8  out of 10 of our students now go on  to  post-secondary  education compared to 1 out of 10  in  those  rosy\r\n\r\ndays  of 1965.  This percentage is at least as high,  if  not\r\n\r\nhigher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthan  even  those  achieved by the most  developed  countries\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked how our less academically inclined\r\n\r\nstudents do after they leave school.  They do very well.  ITE\r\n\r\ngraduates  are  sought after by employers who pay  them  very\r\n\r\nwell.   Even in the midst of the recession last year, 88%  of\r\n\r\nITE  graduates  found  employment  within  three  months   of\r\n\r\ngraduation.   In comparison, there were university  graduates\r\n\r\nwho  were  still  looking for jobs after  half  a  year.   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  the  average  monthly  salary  for   fresh   ITE\r\n\r\ngraduates  range from $1,100-$1,400 a month.   This  compares\r\n\r\nwell  with fresh polytechnic graduates, whose monthly  salary\r\n\r\nranges from $1,500-$1,900 a month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh, Mdm Halimah and others, said that streaming is\r\n\r\ndone  too  early.  Dr Ong asked if streaming  could  be  done\r\n\r\nlater  to  take  into account late-developers.   Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  because  we  have  late-developers  that  we  need\r\n\r\nstreaming.   Otherwise,  what  do  we  do  with   the   late-developers?   Whatever the reason for their  poorer  academic\r\n\r\nperformance at that point in time, forcing them to learn at a\r\n\r\npace  that  they  cannot or are not ready to cope  with  will\r\n\r\nsimply push them out of the system.  Streaming allows them to\r\n\r\ncontinue to learn at a pace comfortable to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after students enter a particular stream, there is\r\n\r\na well-structured progression route for them through to post-secondary education, and a net of \"ladders and bridges\", that\r\n\r\nallows  students  to go as far as they can, and  even  across\r\n\r\nstreams.   It  is  wrong  to say that  our  education  system\r\n\r\nprovides  no  chance for late bloomers.  It is  our  previous\r\n\r\nsystem,  before streaming, that did not provide  chances  for\r\n\r\nlate  bloomers.  That, as I said, is a major  reason  why  so\r\n\r\nmany  of  our 40 and 50-year olds today, people who  went  to\r\n\r\nschool   with  you  and  me,  have  not  completed  secondary\r\n\r\neducation.   They  had no opportunities and,  after  failing,\r\n\r\nstaying  back  a  few  years, they left school,  without  any\r\n\r\nspecific qualification or skill.  In contrast, our system now\r\n\r\nprovides students of all abilities, the opportunity to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  a  solid foundation of at least 10 years of primary  and\r\n\r\nsecondary  education, with 8 out of 10 of them, going  beyond\r\n\r\nthat, to further education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late-developers still have opportunities for self-improvement. Those who do well, and can benefit from going\r\n\r\non  with their education, can do so.  Every year, about 1,000\r\n\r\nITE   graduates  go  on  to  the  polytechnics,   and   1,000\r\n\r\npolytechnic  graduates  go on to our  universities.   Without\r\n\r\nstreaming, late-developers would have been nipped in the  bud\r\n\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a discussion with polytechnic students at a Poly\r\n\r\nSeminar  three years ago.  One student stood up and  lamented\r\n\r\nthat  the  system did not provide second chances.  It  turned\r\n\r\nout that he was 29 years old, and in the Polytechnic.  He was\r\n\r\nin  the process of getting his second chance.  Last year, the\r\n\r\nLee  Kuan Yew Award winner in the ITE was a not so young man,\r\n\r\ncalled  Simon Foo, from the Navy, I am proud to add.  He  was\r\n\r\nthe top graduate of ITE for the year, and has been offered  a\r\n\r\nplace  to  study in the polytechnic.  He is now 27 years  old\r\n\r\nand  married.  Without the Normal programme and the  ITE,  he\r\n\r\nmight never have qualified to go to the polytechnic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the oldest student doing a full-time diploma in our\r\n\r\npolytechnics is now 50 years old.  The oldest doing  a  part-time  diploma  is  68  years old.  The  ITE  is  the  biggest\r\n\r\nprovider  of  continuing education programmes  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwith  34,000  students enrolled, and another  20,000  on  ITE\r\n\r\naccredited  courses conducted by industry training  partners.\r\n\r\nWe  should applaud the chances and opportunities that ITE is,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  giving to many of our students,  to  many  of  our\r\n\r\nmature  Singaporeans,  opportunities  which  they  might  not\r\n\r\notherwise have got.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, a word on streaming. It is important to note\r\n\r\nthat  for streaming in schools, at primary level, there is  a\r\n\r\nparental  option when students are streamed  at  the  end  of\r\n\r\nPrimary  4.  Parents have the final say.  Parents can  choose\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto put their child in the EM3 stream at Primary 5, or if they\r\n\r\nfeel  that they are too stressed, they can choose not to  put\r\n\r\ntheir  children  in  EM1.  But very  few  parents  opt  their\r\n\r\nchildren out of EM1 and many parents opt their children  from\r\n\r\nEM2 to EM1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh suggested that we have a hybrid system where\r\n\r\nchildren  are kept in the same class in primary  school,  and\r\n\r\nbreak  up  for  specific subjects to cater  for  children  of\r\n\r\ndiffering  abilities.  The idea is not a bad one.  The  issue\r\n\r\nis  one  of  practicality - whether  it  will,  in  practice,\r\n\r\nachieve  the  objectives that Mr Singh has  stated.   In  the\r\n\r\nprimary schools, there are basically 4 subjects being taught,\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  being one of them, with the children  already\r\n\r\nsplit  up.  This means that if we split up children for other\r\n\r\nsubjects,  they  would  be breaking  out  of  their  classes,\r\n\r\nperhaps  75-100% of their time.  This would have implications\r\n\r\non resources, time-tabling, etc, and, of course, it will mean\r\n\r\nthat  the  children do not get to spend most  of  their  time\r\n\r\ntogether and just split up for some lessons, which is what Mr\r\n\r\nSingh's objective was.  However, if schools wish to pilot  or\r\n\r\ntry this out, I have no objection to them trying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh also said that students of different abilities\r\n\r\nshould  interact with each other, and I agree  that  this  is\r\n\r\nimportant.   Students have opportunities to build  bonds  and\r\n\r\nfriendships  outside their classrooms.   For  instance,  CCAs\r\n\r\nprovide  avenues for students from different  backgrounds  to\r\n\r\nengage  in the same activities.  The drum-major in the  band,\r\n\r\nthe basket ball captain, or the star in the football team may\r\n\r\nnot  come  from the fastest stream in the school.   And  they\r\n\r\nlearn  to work together and appreciate each other's strengths\r\n\r\nand  weaknesses.  It does not have to be, as Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse say, only in academic activities.  And, in the process,\r\n\r\nthey  get to know each other better and learn to support each\r\n\r\nother  in common endeavours.  I should add that it is because\r\n\r\nwe  have streaming that we pick students from three different\r\n\r\nqueues to enter the same schools, that we have good mixing in\r\n\r\nour secondary schools.  If we did not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave streaming, and students were posted to schools based  on\r\n\r\none  linear list, based on their PSLE t-scores, then all  the\r\n\r\nacademically weakest students would probably be  grouped  in,\r\n\r\nsay,  20  or  so schools, rather than distributed among  more\r\n\r\nthan 120 secondary schools with students from other streams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Khor mentioned that streaming is unpopular among\r\n\r\nteachers.   I  have  frank  discussions  with  teachers   and\r\n\r\nprincipals  regularly, several times a month,  either  during\r\n\r\nschool  visits  or in dialogue sessions at  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  headquarters, in groups of a dozen or so teachers.\r\n\r\nTeachers  generally  recognise children  learn  at  different\r\n\r\npaces, and that it is not helpful for children to be given  a\r\n\r\ncurriculum  that they cannot cope with.  They are  supportive\r\n\r\nof  a  stream, like the EM3, that caters for slower learners.\r\n\r\nContrary to what Mr Singh says, they also do not dread taking\r\n\r\non  EM3  classes.  Some of our most highly motivated teachers\r\n\r\nderive  great  satisfaction, and a  sense  of  mission,  from\r\n\r\nteaching  less  able  kids.  I think Dr Wang  may  well  have\r\n\r\ninterviewed  some  of  them for the Outstanding  Teacher  and\r\n\r\nPresident's Teacher Awards.  But they, like my colleagues  in\r\n\r\nthis  House, do feel for these kids, and wonder how  best  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  kids  cope  with  the  issues  of  labelling   and\r\n\r\nstigmatisation, and to help them build up their self-esteem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These concerns have been expressed by Dr Khor and Mr\r\n\r\nSingh.  Such labelling is really a social phenomenon.  From a\r\n\r\npurely educational standpoint, I think Members in this  House\r\n\r\nwould  agree, that streaming is the correct approach,  as  it\r\n\r\ntries  to maximise the potential of all students by providing\r\n\r\nthem  with  programmes  as well suited  to  the  students  as\r\n\r\npossible,  so  that  as  many of  them  as  possible  can  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful in their own right.  I am not sure really which is\r\n\r\nmore  damaging to self-esteem - to consistently fail  because\r\n\r\nthe curriculum and pace is so fast, or to perform comfortably\r\n\r\nwell,  achieve success in small bites every year, make steady\r\n\r\nprogress in a less demanding stream, and eventually attain  a\r\n\r\nqualification that employers attach value to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has consistently sought to lift the level\r\n\r\nof all our students.  Members, like Dr Ong and Mr Singh, have\r\n\r\nsuggested that there should be additional support for  weaker\r\n\r\nstudents,  and  this  is being done.  At the  primary  school\r\n\r\nlevel,  the  Ministry has a Learning Support Programme  (LSP)\r\n\r\nand  the Encouraging Achievement and Better Learning (ENABLE)\r\n\r\nprogramme to give additional support to pupils who  are  weak\r\n\r\nin  literacy or numeracy skills.  At the secondary level, the\r\n\r\nNormal  (Technical) students were among  the  first  to  have\r\n\r\naccess  to  computers in their schools, before students  from\r\n\r\nany  other streams, when computer laboratories were specially\r\n\r\nset  up  for  the  teaching  of  Normal  (Technical)  subject\r\n\r\nComputer  Applications.   At  the post-secondary  level,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  devoted  great efforts  to  upgrade  technical\r\n\r\neducation.   Sir,  this is a segment of our education  system\r\n\r\nthat  I am particularly proud of.  Some Members of this House\r\n\r\nwere able to accept my invitation to visit the ITE, after the\r\n\r\ndebate on the President's Address, and I would like to extend\r\n\r\nan open invitation to other Members of this House, to see ITE\r\n\r\nfor  themselves, and how well the students are  doing.   Come\r\n\r\nand have a look.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have visited many countries in the past five\r\n\r\nyears, basically to study their education systems, to see how\r\n\r\nwe  can  adapt  the good things that they have done,  to  our\r\n\r\nsystem.  They all have to deal with the issue of how to cater\r\n\r\nto  the different educational needs of the whole spectrum  of\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore education system does this better than\r\n\r\nmost.   And what is the evidence?  In the Third International\r\n\r\nMathematics  and Science Study (1999), 93%  and  80%  of  our\r\n\r\nsecondary 2 students were above the international average for\r\n\r\nMathematics and Science, respectively, for students  of  that\r\n\r\nage group.  Sir, I am not surprised that the US needs to come\r\n\r\nup  with new initiatives like the one that Mr Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\npointed  out,  because a large proportion of  their  students\r\n\r\nfall well behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of a good solid foundation carried through\r\n\r\ninto post-secondary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation,  which  benefits 8 out  of  10  of  our  children,\r\n\r\nprovides them further opportunities in life.  And it places a\r\n\r\nvast  majority  of our students on the correct  side  of  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  divide that divides this world into the  knowledge\r\n\r\nhaves  and the knowledge have-nots.  And our education system\r\n\r\nhas been able to provide a vast majority of Singaporeans with\r\n\r\nthat leg up for the future, in engineering, bio-sciences  and\r\n\r\ninformation technology, not just in the universities, but  in\r\n\r\nthe polytechnics and in the ITEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ultimately, it is better to recognise that\r\n\r\ndifferent  students have different needs, and  to  explicitly\r\n\r\nprovide  different streams and educational opportunities  for\r\n\r\nthem,  than to work on the premise, the hope, that  they  are\r\n\r\nall  the same and fail to provide for their different  needs,\r\n\r\nor  provide for them in an ad hoc way, and then lament  later\r\n\r\nwhen they do not make it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents and schools need to work together so that\r\n\r\neducational  features  like  streaming  and  other  forms  of\r\n\r\nadditional  support  that are meant to help  pupils,  do  not\r\n\r\nbecome  a  cause of stigmatisation.  Ironically,  people  who\r\n\r\noppose  streaming are often the same ones who perpetuate  the\r\n\r\nlabelling of our students - I do not call them failures,  and\r\n\r\nI  am  not  so  sure why so many Members do - by viewing  the\r\n\r\nprovision of a more moderately paced curriculum and  a  sound\r\n\r\ntechnical education for students as something desirable,  and\r\n\r\nwe  can  encourage  them  to achieve their  potential.   This\r\n\r\nattitude   of  labelling and calling them names is  something\r\n\r\nwhich  we  should  change,  and  not  streaming.   I  welcome\r\n\r\nsuggestions  from  Members  on how  we  can  encourage  these\r\n\r\nstudents, and discourage labelling.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang suggested that we should also review school\r\n\r\nranking.   The  introduction of  school  ranking  has  had  a\r\n\r\nsalutary effect on our schools.  It has raised standards  and\r\n\r\nallowed parents to make more informed choices, especially  as\r\n\r\nto which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  value-added schools.  We only rank the top 50  secondary\r\n\r\nschools,  and not all the secondary schools, nor do  we  rank\r\n\r\nthe primary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, school ranking is increasingly being adopted in the\r\n\r\nUnited States and in the UK, where often all the schools  are\r\n\r\nranked  from  top to bottom.  And it is often in response  to\r\n\r\ndemands  from parents to know how well schools are  educating\r\n\r\ntheir  children,  because parents want to know.   I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  if we did not have school ranking  and  did  not\r\n\r\nprovide  information on how schools are doing, there will  be\r\n\r\nparents  who  will ask us, and I think it is their  right  to\r\n\r\nknow.  There is nothing to hide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US and the UK, teachers do not like ranking - Dr Wang is quite right - because the teachers are now held\r\n\r\naccountable  to  standards when, previously, they  were  not.\r\n\r\nBut  should we hold our schools and teachers accountable  for\r\n\r\nstandards?   I think the answer is yes.  Sir, I  am  open  to\r\n\r\nideas  on  how ranking can be improved, and suggestions  from\r\n\r\nMembers of the House are welcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, I informed Members of this House that we\r\n\r\nintroduced   a  new  appraisal  system  called   the   School\r\n\r\nExcellence  Model,  where schools do self-evaluation  on  not\r\n\r\njust their outputs but also their internal processes.  I have\r\n\r\ngiven out awards for Best Practice and Sustained Achievements\r\n\r\nsince  1999, to recognise schools for a wide range of  areas,\r\n\r\nfrom  CCA  to staff development.  However, these awards  have\r\n\r\nnot  attracted nearly as much attention from the  public  and\r\n\r\nthe  media as school ranking.  But I do hope that, over time,\r\n\r\nthe public will learn to recognise that a good school is more\r\n\r\nthan  just an absolute ranking, and consists of a whole  host\r\n\r\nof other things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo has suggested that our system is too stressful\r\n\r\nand  puts too much pressure on students.  It is true that our\r\n\r\nstudents study hard in school, and that our schools  seek  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  students do their best.   However,  the  strong\r\n\r\nfoundation that our Singapore children have acquired from the\r\n\r\nhard work that they put in, and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstrong  work  ethic, are important qualities that  will  help\r\n\r\nthem to succeed in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, Members who feel that our children are\r\n\r\nover  loaded should be strong advocates of streaming,  as  it\r\n\r\naddresses  precisely  their concern  by  differentiating  the\r\n\r\npacing and content  of curriculum according to ability.   Mdm\r\n\r\nHalimah and others have said that children are more concerned\r\n\r\nabout  their  examinations than they are about their  parents\r\n\r\ndying.  Frankly, Sir, I think we are fortunate to live  in  a\r\n\r\ncountry  where  children are focused  on  their  studies  and\r\n\r\nexaminations,  and not on their parents  dying.   I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  that  if we live in a war-torn country  or  a  country\r\n\r\nwhich is rife with terrorism and so on, then children will be\r\n\r\nworried about their parents dying everyday, rather than their\r\n\r\nschools  and  examinations.  I would not like to  live  in  a\r\n\r\ncountry like that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of excessive pressure arises when there is a\r\n\r\nmismatch  between  expectations  and  achievement.   Schools,\r\n\r\nparents and society need to understand that while we want the\r\n\r\nbest  for our children, we should not push them beyond  their\r\n\r\nlimits.   One  example is streaming at Primary 4.   There  is\r\n\r\nreally  no  point  overloading children  with  higher  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  in EM1 if they are unable to cope.  Yet, many parents\r\n\r\nopt in to EM1 stream for their children, and few opt out from\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The movie, I Not Stupid, reflected quite starkly how\r\n\r\nsome  Singaporeans  have  chosen  parochial  definitions   of\r\n\r\nsuccess  and imposed them on their children. Mr Yeo mentioned\r\n\r\na  serious  moment in the movie where one of  the  characters\r\n\r\nwanted  to commit suicide.  Sir, I happen to think that  this\r\n\r\nis an excellent movie.  It  provides a mirror for our society\r\n\r\nand for each of us, and allows each of us to see how we might\r\n\r\nactually  be behaving and how this behaviour may  even,  with\r\n\r\nthe  best  of  intentions,  have a  negative  effect  on  our\r\n\r\nchildren and on others.  It is a useful movie for principals,\r\n\r\nparents  and teachers to watch.   I should point out, though,\r\n\r\nthat in the movie, the student wanted to commit suicide,  not\r\n\r\nbecause  he could not cope with his school work, but  because\r\n\r\nhe could not live up to his mother's unrealistic expectations\r\n\r\nthat he attain more than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n90  marks  in  his  test.   We need a broader  definition  of\r\n\r\nsuccess.   Being  all  that we can be should  be  counted  as\r\n\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr Singh said that the Ministry should set\r\n\r\nperformance  targets on the number of lateral transfers  from\r\n\r\nwhat  he calls a lower stream to a higher stream, he  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  narrowing  the  definition of  what  it  means  to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful, to whether a student is able to move from EM3  to\r\n\r\nEM2.    The  Ministry  does  not  have  targets  for  lateral\r\n\r\ntransfers, because setting such targets means that we will be\r\n\r\nforcing  students  to learn at a pace that they  cannot  cope\r\n\r\nwith.   This is not the best thing for them.  This may result\r\n\r\nin  pushing them out of the system.  It is more meaningful to\r\n\r\nprovide  an  appropriate programme with adequate  and  proper\r\n\r\nsupport  to  weaker students to maximise their potential  and\r\n\r\nprovide  them with avenues of progression.  EM3 students  can\r\n\r\nprogress  through the system.  Nobody has given up  on  them,\r\n\r\nand this has been our approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On counselling, the Ministry has a programme for\r\n\r\naddressing  the  social  and  emotional  needs  of  students.\r\n\r\nCounselling  is  available through the entire  age  range  of\r\n\r\nstudents.    All  teachers  are  given  basic   training   in\r\n\r\ncounselling, and there are teacher counsellors of which there\r\n\r\nare two in each school, but they are part time.  We also have\r\n\r\ntrained  some  30 retired education officers as  counsellors.\r\n\r\nAnd  by July this year, they will be deployed to schools  and\r\n\r\nto  clusters.   But this is an area in which I  will  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  to agree that we can do with more assistance.  Schools\r\n\r\nwork  with VWOs, Family Service Centres and self-help groups.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, that is one of the reasons why since 1997-1998,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Education, together with the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth, has been promoting the support services such as those\r\n\r\nprovided by the Institute of Mental Health, resulting  in  an\r\n\r\nincrease in attendances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While schools provide support for the pupils, the\r\n\r\nsupport  from  home  is  of paramount importance  in  helping\r\n\r\nstudents  to  cope with stress, and when they face  distress.\r\n\r\nMr  Gan  suggested that there might also be a need to counsel\r\n\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, that is so, and where there is a need for parents to  be\r\n\r\ncounselled, I suggest that they be referred to Family Service\r\n\r\nCentres  for  the  necessary support.  The Ministry  and  our\r\n\r\nschools  will  be  happy  to work  with  other  agencies  and\r\n\r\norganisations  on  this issue, as it is an  issue  which  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   itself  is  not  particularly  well  equipped   to\r\n\r\nundertake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education seeks to provide Singaporeans with the\r\n\r\nopportunity to fulfil their potential.  Because the potential\r\n\r\nof our students is multi-faceted, our education system has to\r\n\r\nprovide  opportunities to different programmes and  different\r\n\r\ntypes of institutions.  The way forward is to provide greater\r\n\r\ndiversity  in  the  school  system  and  allowing  for   more\r\n\r\neducational routes and models, not just to consider one route\r\n\r\nor  one model as the success paradigm, as many in this  House\r\n\r\nseem  to have the orientation towards.  Such an approach will\r\n\r\nallow us to more fully develop the different abilities of our\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, the Ministry is currently carrying\r\n\r\nout a review of junior college and upper secondary education,\r\n\r\nand  I  will  ask  the Senior Minister of State,  Mr  Tharman\r\n\r\nShanmugaratnam, to update Members on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam):</b> Sir, Dr Wang Kai Yuen has expressed views on\r\n\r\nthe issues under MOE's review of the junior college and upper\r\n\r\nsecondary education system.  The Review Committee on  JC  and\r\n\r\nUpper Secondary Education, which comprises both educationists\r\n\r\nas  well as people from the people sector, private sector and\r\n\r\npublic  sector  and which I chair, is looking into  two  main\r\n\r\nareas.  First, the principles and framework for a revised  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum;   and,  second,  the  introduction   of   greater\r\n\r\ndiversity of programmes within schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current JC curriculum has its strengths. The 'A'\r\n\r\nlevels have served  as the standard bearer for the rigour and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh standards of our JC and pre-university education for the\r\n\r\nlast  30  years.    Over  the  years,  we  have  continuously\r\n\r\nimproved  the JC curriculum, but the basic structure  of  the\r\n\r\n'A' level programme is unchanged from the time we adopted  it\r\n\r\nfrom  the  British.   It  is a system that  was  designed  to\r\n\r\nprovide students at age 17-18 with a strong core of knowledge\r\n\r\nin  a few subjects  -  3 or 4 subjects  -  to prepare them to\r\n\r\nenter  the workplace.  It also prepared students to go on  to\r\n\r\nuniversities  in  the  British mould  -   universities  which\r\n\r\nrequire  students to complete relatively specialised  degrees\r\n\r\nwithin three years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic structure is one of specialisation at the 'A'\r\n\r\nlevels after a broad secondary school education leading up to\r\n\r\nthe  'O'  levels.  It is like the British system,  but  quite\r\n\r\nunlike  that  in  the US and most of the European  countries,\r\n\r\nwhere  students  undergo a broad-based curriculum  throughout\r\n\r\ntheir  school  and  pre-university years.   Our  universities\r\n\r\nhave, however, departed from the British model.  They offer 4-year  degree  programmes  in many disciplines,  and  are  now\r\n\r\nproviding  a  broader education within the first  and  second\r\n\r\nyears of university.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, most students who are now sitting for the 'A'\r\n\r\nlevels go on to university, unlike the situation 20-30  years\r\n\r\nago.   It  is  no longer a terminal qualification.   Our  'A'\r\n\r\nlevel  curriculum requires students to narrow their  interest\r\n\r\nafter  the  'O'  levels, before they  broaden  out  again  at\r\n\r\nuniversity.   Dr  Wang Kai Yuen described  the  structure  as\r\n\r\nhaving a Coca Cola bottle shape.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are reviewing the JC curriculum, not because it has\r\n\r\nworked  badly,  but  because of the  fundamentally  different\r\n\r\nenvironment which young Singaporeans will have to  engage  in\r\n\r\nin  future.  We have transited to a knowledge-based  economy.\r\n\r\nWe   have  to  prepare  the  young,  as  Dr  Wang  says,  for\r\n\r\nuncertainty, in a rapidly changing environment.  Flexibility,\r\n\r\nand  an ability to understand and draw on different knowledge\r\n\r\ndisciplines, will be at a premium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be difficult for students to know at age 17, or\r\n\r\neven when they are at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuniversity,  what  jobs  they will do  when  they  enter  the\r\n\r\nworkforce, or what new jobs they will take on over the course\r\n\r\nof  their careers.  Further, whatever profession they are in,\r\n\r\nthey  will have to pick up new knowledge and skills every  so\r\n\r\noften, to stay on top of their jobs and to keep an edge  over\r\n\r\nthe  competition.  More of this knowledge will be drawn  from\r\n\r\nthe  interconnections between disciplines.  Many of the major\r\n\r\nbreakthroughs  in  knowledge, and the economic  opportunities\r\n\r\nthat  come  with  them, are coming out of the spaces  between\r\n\r\ntraditional subject disciplines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to prepare our young for this future. An\r\n\r\nexample  is  bio-engineering, already an area  of  tremendous\r\n\r\nopportunity.  To groom talent in bio-engineering, we  ideally\r\n\r\nwant  engineers  who know something about biology.   But  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  JC curriculum, like that in the UK, but unlike  that\r\n\r\nin  the  United States, grooms future engineers who  have  no\r\n\r\nexposure  to biology at the JC level, and often even earlier.\r\n\r\nWithin  the  framework  of  four 'A'  level  subjects,  those\r\n\r\nwanting  to do engineering at university will typically  take\r\n\r\ntwo  mathematics subjects,  physics and chemistry.  There  is\r\n\r\nno  room to spare for biology.  NUS and NTU are now remedying\r\n\r\nthis by requiring engineering students to take biology during\r\n\r\ntheir  first year at university.  But the long-term  solution\r\n\r\nis  to  give some of our future engineers exposure to biology\r\n\r\nat  JC, without them giving up any of the other subjects that\r\n\r\nthey  wish  to  take.  This is an example of why  we  need  a\r\n\r\nbroader and more flexible JC curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key part of the work of the Review Committee is public\r\n\r\nconsultation.  Over the past two months, we have had dialogue\r\n\r\nwith  various groups with a stake in education   -   parents,\r\n\r\nemployers,   entrepreneurs   and  professionals,   academics,\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers, and students themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been broad support in the public consultation\r\n\r\non  the  need  to broaden the JC curriculum, in a  number  of\r\n\r\nrespects.    First,   on  the  academic  component   of   the\r\n\r\ncurriculum,   there  is  consensus  in  favour  of   students\r\n\r\nacquiring\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  broader range of knowledge, and for greater emphasis to be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  critical  process skills,  such  as  thinking  and\r\n\r\ninnovative  skills,  the ability to make  connections  across\r\n\r\nsubject disciplines, and communication skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is considerable feedback that there should\r\n\r\nbe adequate emphasis on the non-academic curriculum, so as to\r\n\r\ndevelop  life skills and enhance the leadership qualities  of\r\n\r\nour  JC students. Employers, teachers and parents alike  have\r\n\r\nemphasised  the  need to nurture strength of character,  team\r\n\r\nspirit,  enterprise, and a passion in what the  students  do.\r\n\r\nWhatever they choose to do, they must have passion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Review Committee is studying various approaches to\r\n\r\nbroaden  the academic curriculum in JCs.  One of these  is  a\r\n\r\nmodular approach to the junior college curriculum, that  will\r\n\r\nallow  students  to  offer  a  core  curriculum  as  well  as\r\n\r\nelectives in different areas.  The elective subjects would be\r\n\r\nquite  unlike the 'S' papers today, for instance, which drill\r\n\r\ndeeper  into  subjects that students are taking  at  the  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel.   The  broader JC curriculum could also be  shaped  to\r\n\r\ntake  into  account  what  a student  studies  in  his  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary  years.   All  JC students  would  thus  undergo  a\r\n\r\nholistic  programme of academic development over four  years,\r\n\r\nin  a  range of subjects at their \"O\" and \"A\" levels, and  at\r\n\r\nvarying  levels of difficulty.  So as not to confuse Members,\r\n\r\nthis  is quite distinct from the issue of integrated schools,\r\n\r\nor  through-train schools, which I will come to in a  moment.\r\n\r\nThe  proposal  I  have just mentioned is one of  those  being\r\n\r\nstudied  for  all  JC students as part of  the  comprehensive\r\n\r\nreview of the JC curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also support in the Review Committee and in our\r\n\r\npublic  consultations for retaining adequate depth in the  JC\r\n\r\ncurriculum.   The main reason for this is that students  have\r\n\r\nto  pursue  some subjects to a sufficient level of depth  and\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  order  to  train their  thinking  skills  and\r\n\r\ndevelop their powers of critical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanalysis.   The traditional reasons for depth  are  also  not\r\n\r\nirrelevant - the foundations that students acquire at  JC  in\r\n\r\npreparation  for university cannot be too thin,  particularly\r\n\r\nfor those going on to pursue engineering and the sciences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes we introduce to the JC curriculum must\r\n\r\ntherefore achieve an appropriate balance between breadth  and\r\n\r\ndepth  of  coverage,  between  content  mastery  and  process\r\n\r\nskills,  and between the academic and non-academic components\r\n\r\nof  the curriculum.  We must not compromise on the rigour  of\r\n\r\nour  JC  curriculum.  If we adopt a broader or more  flexible\r\n\r\ncurriculum,  the learning process must remain demanding.   We\r\n\r\nhave to broaden the scope of the students' curriculum without\r\n\r\nlowering  standards,  the  way it  has  turned  out  in  some\r\n\r\ncountries.  But there will have to be trade-offs, so that  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  increase the overall load on students and  teachers.\r\n\r\nThere is no slack in our JCs, unlike the situation in the UK,\r\n\r\nfor instance, before they introduced recent reforms requiring\r\n\r\nstudents  to  take more subjects at the \"A\" levels,  or  what\r\n\r\nthey  called  \"half-A  levels\".   We  cannot  inject  greater\r\n\r\nbreadth  without reducing the scope of content which students\r\n\r\nlearn  within the subjects they choose to specialise in.   So\r\n\r\nthere are trade-offs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Review Committee is also studying whether we can\r\n\r\nachieve  greater  diversity in the  structure  of  the  upper\r\n\r\nsecondary  and JC education system, by allowing some  schools\r\n\r\nto   offer  new  pathways  to  a  university  education,  new\r\n\r\ncurricula and new assessment methods.  We need this diversity\r\n\r\nin  our  system  because there can be no single  formula  for\r\n\r\npreparing our young for an innovation-driven future   -   and\r\n\r\nan  unpredictable future, a future which Mrs Yu-Foo described\r\n\r\nas \"a change every day\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our public consultation sessions, there has been\r\n\r\npositive  feedback  on  the case for specialised  independent\r\n\r\nschools   to  develop  students  with  special  talents   and\r\n\r\nabilities.  For instance, an Arts School\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor a Mathematics and Science School, modelled along the lines\r\n\r\nof  the Sports School, which will be operational in 2004.  Dr\r\n\r\nWang  asked if such schools should not be run by the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education.  MOE will fund specialised independent schools\r\n\r\nin the same way it funds other independent schools.  However,\r\n\r\nwe  prefer  to have a specialised school run by  a  community\r\n\r\nthat is willing to support the school and has an interest  in\r\n\r\nits  success,  such  as the arts community  in  the  case  of\r\n\r\nstudents with special talents in the arts.  This is the  best\r\n\r\nway of ensuring that there is demand for the school, and that\r\n\r\nthe  expertise,  resources and energy of  the  community  are\r\n\r\nbrought  to  bear  in  the running of the  school,  not  just\r\n\r\ninitially  but on a continuing basis.  The community  has  to\r\n\r\ntake ownership for the school to succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that has attracted much discussion is the\r\n\r\npossibility  of allowing some schools or Junior  Colleges  to\r\n\r\noffer   integrated  programmes,  including  both  the   upper\r\n\r\nsecondary  and  JC level, within the same school.   There  is\r\n\r\nsupport  in  our  public  consultations  for  this  proposal.\r\n\r\nIntegrated  programmes could be either  four-year  programmes\r\n\r\nbeginning  in Secondary 3, up to JC 2, or six-year programmes\r\n\r\nfrom  Secondary 1 to JC 2.  They can be offered by  a  single\r\n\r\ninstitution or by a family of institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the possibilities that is opened up by an\r\n\r\nintegrated school is for some of its students - those who are\r\n\r\nconfident of doing well in their \"A\" levels - to skip the \"O\"\r\n\r\nlevels  to  free up time to develop their interests  and  for\r\n\r\nother  broader educational experiences.  We are also studying\r\n\r\nthe  possibility of allowing students in some schools to work\r\n\r\ntowards  different final qualifications, instead of  the  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevels.   This could include allowing one or two  schools  to\r\n\r\noffer   alternative  programmes  such  as  the  International\r\n\r\nBaccalaureate, with appropriate local content.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that a more diverse education system,\r\n\r\nincluding  new  school structures or schools  with  different\r\n\r\ncurricula,   will   carry  with  it  a   greater   sense   of\r\n\r\ndifferentiation.  However, admission\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  such  programmes has to be open, fair and meritocratic.\r\n\r\nDr  Wang  raised  the  issue  of  whether  the  PSLE  was  an\r\n\r\nappropriate  point at which students should be  selected  for\r\n\r\nintegrated programmes leading up to JC.  We are studying this\r\n\r\ncarefully.   There  could be different points  of  entry  for\r\n\r\ndifferent  schools offering integrated programmes,  depending\r\n\r\non  how  they  structure  their integrated  programmes.   One\r\n\r\nmethod being considered is for schools offering an integrated\r\n\r\nprogramme to admit students after the PSLE, as they currently\r\n\r\ndo, and to assess after the lower secondary years, whether  a\r\n\r\nstudent is suited to progressing on the integrated programme.\r\n\r\nNot  all  students in such schools will want to skip the  \"O\"\r\n\r\nlevels.   The  schools offering integrated programmes  should\r\n\r\nalso  be able to take in a certain number of students at some\r\n\r\npoint  after the PSLE entry level.  The school could do  this\r\n\r\nby administering its own admission tests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we consider freeing up the mainstream state-funded\r\n\r\nschool  system  to  allow for greater choice,  the  case  for\r\n\r\nschools which are privately run and privately funded has been\r\n\r\nless  compelling.   Participants in the  public  consultation\r\n\r\nprocess  have  placed  greater  priority  on  the  need   for\r\n\r\ndiversity  within  the  state-funded  system.   However,  the\r\n\r\nReview  Committee  has  kept an open mind  on  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nprivate  schools at this point.  We are not  ruling  out  the\r\n\r\npossibility of recommending that the Government allow  for  a\r\n\r\nfew private schools who have a particular niche to serve, and\r\n\r\nwho  can  provide  an  added source of ideas  and  innovative\r\n\r\npractices in education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, the review of the JC and upper\r\n\r\nsecondary  education  system is an important  part  of  MOE's\r\n\r\nefforts to meet future challenges.  The Review Committee will\r\n\r\nput up a consultation document for further public comment  in\r\n\r\na few months' time, and make its final recommendations to the\r\n\r\nGovernment within five months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are embarking on major innovations in our upper\r\n\r\nsecondary and Junior College system.  Any changes that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  decides to adopt will have to be thought  through\r\n\r\nin  detail, and prepared for extensively.  Teachers will have\r\n\r\nto be prepared, and will have to be confident of teaching any\r\n\r\nnew  curriculum  well.  A major change to the  JC  curriculum\r\n\r\nwill  take about five years to develop and implement.  If  we\r\n\r\nallow some schools to offer integrated programmes leading  to\r\n\r\nJunior  College, those that are conducted within the existing\r\n\r\ncurriculum framework can take off within the next two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines) Sir, a clarification on the\r\n\r\nMinister's  earlier  statement.  In  asking  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nredefine the definition of success, I would like to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  the  Government is  prepared  to  set  the\r\n\r\nexample  by  doing  away  with the distinction  in  labelling\r\n\r\nwithin  the  civil  service itself.  It is common  perception\r\n\r\nthat  within the service, there is a distinction made between\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin, that is not a clarification.\r\n\r\nThat is a question.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> I will ask a question. I am coming to\r\n\r\nmy  question  soon.

I am sorry.  Mdm Ho Geok Choo.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I am indeed heartened by MOS Mr\r\n\r\nTharman's  enumeration  of what is  likely  to  come  in  the\r\n\r\nrevised syllabus of tertiary students.  I would like to  take\r\n\r\nthis   opportunity  though  to  elaborate  on  the  important\r\n\r\neconomic survival skills that our tertiary students  must  be\r\n\r\nequipped with, in order to give them that booster start  when\r\n\r\nthey enter their first career.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the educational institutions\r\n\r\ntrain  and  educate our students well in  a  broad  range  of\r\n\r\nsubjects, from Mathematics to computing to the life sciences.\r\n\r\nThis education equips our students with knowledge, skills and\r\n\r\nabilities  which  enable them to take up  jobs  in  different\r\n\r\nsectors and thus contribute to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  economic  life of the nation.  It seems to me,  however,\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  a  missing link.  In as  much  as  they  are\r\n\r\ntechnically competent to take on employment, they  are  often\r\n\r\nrelatively less well-prepared to transit into the wider  work\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this I mean that graduates need, on the one hand, to\r\n\r\nhave an awareness of trends and happenings in the wider socio-economic and cultural environment and, on the other hand, the\r\n\r\nability  or, at the very least, an understanding of  what  it\r\n\r\ntakes  to relate and interact with significant others in  the\r\n\r\nworkplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, words like `globalisation', `the knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy' and `continuous learning' are more than buzzwords  - they  have an impact on organisations and people who work  in\r\n\r\nthem.  Do our students actually know what they mean, and what\r\n\r\ntheir  significance is?  How does the economic climate impact\r\n\r\non jobs and careers and how should these changes be managed?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the workplace, for example, how may one conduct\r\n\r\ninterpersonal   relations   effectively?    How   does    one\r\n\r\ncommunicate   with  one's  superiors,  peers,   subordinates,\r\n\r\nclients and suppliers?  What does it take to work in a  team?\r\n\r\nHow  does one motivate oneself and others?  How does one deal\r\n\r\nwith   the  `difference'  in  a  workplace  that  has  become\r\n\r\nincreasingly  diversified?  And as we move to strengthen  our\r\n\r\nservice  sector  of the economy, how much do fresh  graduates\r\n\r\nknow about the management of emotions that is inherent in the\r\n\r\nnature of service work?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All such knowledge constitutes competencies which can\r\n\r\ninfluence   significantly   individual   and   organisational\r\n\r\nperformance.   They  also have a role to  play  in  fostering\r\n\r\ncreativity  and  an innovative frame of mind.   On  a  larger\r\n\r\nscale,  the possession of such competencies can constitute  a\r\n\r\ncompetitive advantage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it may be argued that, even without formal\r\n\r\nlearning,  employees do, in time, acquire  such  competencies\r\n\r\nrelating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  wider  environment and the conduct of  interpersonal\r\n\r\nrelations.  I would contend however that rather than  waiting\r\n\r\nfor  employees to acquire such competencies through what  may\r\n\r\nbe  painful and costly trial-and-error experiences over time,\r\n\r\nwe  can  shorten the learning curve considerably by inserting\r\n\r\nthat   learning  into  the  curriculum  of  polytechnic   and\r\n\r\nuniversity graduates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have in mind the institutionalisation of a course on\r\n\r\nthe  management  of  human relations in the  polytechnic  and\r\n\r\nuniversity  curriculum.   Could the Minister  kindly  outline\r\n\r\nwhat measures his Ministry will take to prepare our graduates\r\n\r\nfor  this transition to the work environment in the knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, some Singaporeans still\r\n\r\nperceive Chinese to be dull and difficult to study,  and  the\r\n\r\nChinese  teachers to be rigid, inflexible and their  teaching\r\n\r\nmethods  outdated  and  uninteresting.   In  fact,  this  has\r\n\r\nimproved  as new teaching methods were introduced, but  image\r\n\r\nproblems  appear  to persist.  Today, more and  more  Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage teachers, as what we understand, employ creative and\r\n\r\nlively teaching methods to cater to today's students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My key concern, however, is that MOE has set too many\r\n\r\nrestrictions on the assessment of the subjects in primary and\r\n\r\nsecondary schools.  Some examples of irrelevant and  outdated\r\n\r\ncontents, such as standard letter-writing format, unrealistic\r\n\r\ncomposition  topics,  were still  enforced  by  MOE  and  the\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to enhance the effectiveness of teaching and\r\n\r\nlearning,  there is a need to review the assessment  methods.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in many secondary schools today, \"ciyu  jieshi\"\r\n\r\nis still a key component of test and CA for Chinese Language,\r\n\r\nwhich  request the students to write out word  by  word  from\r\n\r\nmemory  the meaning of the specific vocabulary.  The  way  we\r\n\r\nset  the  test makes learning of Chinese as if memorising  by\r\n\r\nheart  the book of vocabulary.  This has not only demoralised\r\n\r\nand  made  the learning of the Chinese Language tiresome  but\r\n\r\nalso\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhindered  the  ability of the students to learn  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage  in  a  more  creative and  interesting  way.   Many\r\n\r\nstudents end up really hating the Chinese Language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today, we also have many principals sitting in the\r\n\r\npublic  gallery.   I  really hope  the  MOE  and  the  school\r\n\r\nprincipals will consider this seriously.  The examination and\r\n\r\ntesting  formats  should be closely linked to  the  desirable\r\n\r\nlearning outcomes.  We need innovative ideas for teaching and\r\n\r\nlearning,  but,  more  importantly, we  also  need  them  for\r\n\r\ntesting  and assessment.  Innovation in learning and teaching\r\n\r\nof  the  Chinese  Language  will  not  be  effective  without\r\n\r\ninnovation in the assessment methods.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin Boon Ann, you can try and slip in\r\n\r\nyour question now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I will save my question for\r\n\r\nanother day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the learning of mother tongue as a second language\r\n\r\nin  our schools has been the subject of much contention, both\r\n\r\nwithin and outside this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably, the underlying principle of our second\r\n\r\nlanguage  policy  is,  among other things,  to  preserve  our\r\n\r\ncultural  heritage, since language is the  vehicle  by  which\r\n\r\nvalues are transmitted from one generation to another.\r\n\r\nSir,  in  my  response during the debate on  the  President's\r\n\r\nAddress earlier this year in this House, I had said that  one\r\n\r\nmajor  limitation  of sending Singaporeans overseas  lies  in\r\n\r\neducation.  In particular, I believe that it is the  learning\r\n\r\nof  the  second  language that discourages  many  from  going\r\n\r\noverseas to work.  There is a genuine concern that when  they\r\n\r\nreturn  from  their  overseas posting  or  assignment,  their\r\n\r\nchildren, having spent time overseas, may not be able to cope\r\n\r\nwith  the second language, especially if the posting is to  a\r\n\r\ncountry  that does not provide a proper environment  for  the\r\n\r\nlearning  of  the second language.  The consequence  then  is\r\n\r\nthat for Singaporeans who invest overseas, it is difficult\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  them  to find middle or top management to these  places,\r\n\r\nusually it is these people who are the ones with school-going\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a point, the Government recognises this problem. I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the children of school-going age  who  spent\r\n\r\nsometime  overseas are given some dispensation from  learning\r\n\r\nthe  second  language.  For instance, a child who  is  absent\r\n\r\nfrom Singapore for some time need not offer a second language\r\n\r\nif he or she returns to Singapore in his PSLE year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in an extremely competitive environment, such as\r\n\r\nours, I am not sure if such policies are sufficient to induce\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  go overseas.  While the Ministry  has  been\r\n\r\nflexible in its second language policy, I feel that  it  does\r\n\r\nnot  go  far  enough.  To begin with, it does not  completely\r\n\r\nexempt the child from the requirements of the second language\r\n\r\naltogether.  There could be situations where the child may be\r\n\r\naway  too  long  for him to catch up with his language  to  a\r\n\r\npoint  where he is at a complete disadvantage to  his  peers.\r\n\r\nDoes  this  mean  therefore that he will  perpetually  labour\r\n\r\nunder this disadvantage?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, the Government can do more. First, our\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  be prepared to be more  flexible  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond language requirements if it is clear that the child is\r\n\r\nunlikely  to,  within  the duration  of  his  school  career,\r\n\r\neffectively  attain  a measure of competence  in  the  second\r\n\r\nlanguage  that  will  not put him at a distinct  disadvantage\r\n\r\nwith  the  rest.   In such cases, the Ministry  should  allow\r\n\r\nperhaps  the children the option of doing the second language\r\n\r\nat a more basic level, such as the CL 'B', as a way of easing\r\n\r\nthe children into the language.  Additionally, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  be prepared to back its high demands on the  language\r\n\r\nrequirements, by investing more resources in the teaching  of\r\n\r\nthe  second  language through the Internet.  Sir,  using  the\r\n\r\nInternet has the distinct advantage of allowing people to log\r\n\r\non to the site wherever they are.  It is a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvirtual  classroom  that  is not  constrained  by  space  and\r\n\r\nperhaps time.  With multi-media capability, it would  not  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  for the child to pick up the language skills  even\r\n\r\nin  the  spoken aspect of it.  The Internet may therefore  be\r\n\r\nused  to  update  also  the parents on  the  latest  syllabus\r\n\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that, to deal with the competing demands of\r\n\r\nsecond language and the need to send Singaporeans with  young\r\n\r\nfamilies overseas, we need not solve this by doing away  with\r\n\r\nthe  requirement  to  learn the second  language  altogether.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the Government can be flexible in its demands and\r\n\r\nis  prepared to invest more in Internet technology to  assist\r\n\r\nin  the learning of the language, I am sure it will go a long\r\n\r\nway towards encouraging Singaporeans to go overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, let me tell a\r\n\r\nstory.  Once upon a time, a pack of wolves were living  on  a\r\n\r\nhill.  There  were  black  wolves, brown  wolves  and  yellow\r\n\r\nwolves. At another hill nearby lived a group of monkeys,  and\r\n\r\nthey were gorgeous golden monkeys. Among this pack of wolves,\r\n\r\nthere was one yellow wolf  who did not like the colour of his\r\n\r\nfur, and he was also not happy with the sound of his howling.\r\n\r\nHe  aspired to become a golden monkey, like those  living  on\r\n\r\nthe  nearby hill. He therefore tried very hard to  learn  the\r\n\r\ncries  of  the  monkeys,  imitate  their  postures  and  even\r\n\r\npractised the way they climbed the trees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, he thought he had mastered the crying, walking\r\n\r\nand  climbing skills of the monkeys, and decided to go to the\r\n\r\nother  hill  to  join the monkeys as one of  them.  But,  the\r\n\r\nmoment the monkeys saw this wolf approaching, they surrounded\r\n\r\nhim  and attacked him. Fortunately for him, he managed to run\r\n\r\naway  very quickly, but not before he sustained injuries  all\r\n\r\nover  his  body.   Dejectedly, he returned  to  the  pack  of\r\n\r\nwolves.  But, when he opened his mouth, he had forgotten  how\r\n\r\nto  howl like a wolf, and found himself unable to blend  into\r\n\r\nthe pack of wolves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral of this story is that no matter how well the\r\n\r\nyellow wolf had learnt the language of the monkeys, he should\r\n\r\nnot  neglect  his  own mother tongue, to howl  like  a  wolf.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  no  matter  how hard you have  learnt  to  acquire\r\n\r\nproficiency in another language, you must not forget your own\r\n\r\nmother tongue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his memoir, the Senior Minister mentioned that when\r\n\r\nhe and his wife were studying in England, they met a group of\r\n\r\nChinese students and from his interaction with them, he began\r\n\r\nto realise the extent of his cultural loss.  He did not learn\r\n\r\nthe  Asian  culture,  and he did not belong  to  the  English\r\n\r\nculture.  He  was lost somewhere between the  two.  For  this\r\n\r\nreason,  he subsequently sent all his children to the Chinese\r\n\r\nschool to study their mother tongue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is former NMP, Dr Lee Tsao Yuan. It was\r\n\r\nonly  after  the age of 40 that she began to re-discover  her\r\n\r\nown cultural roots. As such, we have a responsibility to help\r\n\r\nevery citizen know and retain his own cultural heritage,  and\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  is the important key to the  preservation  of\r\n\r\ncultural  heritage.  Therefore, we have a  responsibility  to\r\n\r\nhelp  every  one of our citizens maintain his   own  cultural\r\n\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may say that you could also learn your own\r\n\r\nculture  through  the  English  language.  Is  that   so?   I\r\n\r\npersonally feel that it is impossible for one to go deep into\r\n\r\nthe  quintessence  of  Chinese culture through  English,  and\r\n\r\nlearn to appreciate the beauty of the Tang Dynasty poems. You\r\n\r\ncannot  really  understand your own  language  and  your  own\r\n\r\nculture through another language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people allege that mother tongue is the cause of\r\n\r\nracial segregation, and are fond of proposing that the mother\r\n\r\ntongue  be  abolished.    They  use  incidents  such  as  the\r\n\r\nSeptember  11, the tudung, etc, as an excuse to advocate  the\r\n\r\nscrapping  of  the SAP schools and the community-based  self-help groups. Some   cited the United States as an example and\r\n\r\nsay  that  in  the United States, everybody speaks  the  same\r\n\r\nlanguage. It is a big melting pot, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnobody  cares about his cultural roots.  I do not think  this\r\n\r\nis  true. As a matter of fact, a lot of people in the  United\r\n\r\nStates  are actively searching for their roots. Remember  the\r\n\r\nfamous  best-seller, Roots by Alex Haley. It  gives  a  vivid\r\n\r\naccount  of  how  the Americans are looking  for  their  lost\r\n\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, our political leaders, including the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,   Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation have repeatedly emphasised the importance of mother\r\n\r\ntongue to alleviate the doubts of these people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot prevent other people from giving up their\r\n\r\nown  mother tongue and culture to accept another language  or\r\n\r\nanother culture, like the wolf in my earlier story.   But  we\r\n\r\nmust try to make sure that every Singaporean, whether Chinese\r\n\r\nor  Malay  or Indian, will have the opportunity to learn  his\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  to know his own roots.  Only  then,  can  the\r\n\r\nvarious communities feel that their own culture will  not  be\r\n\r\nthreatened.  By learning their own culture, they will be able\r\n\r\nto build up their  pride and respect for their own community.\r\n\r\nAnd  only with the pride and respect for their own community,\r\n\r\ncan  they trust the other groups and to live in harmony  with\r\n\r\nthe other communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, with this globalised new economy, it\r\n\r\nwill  certainly bring an impact on our society  and  culture.\r\n\r\nThe  retention and enhancement of our traditional values  can\r\n\r\nhelp to alleviate some of these adverse impacts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby urge the Minister for Education to reiterate\r\n\r\nthe  status  of  the mother tongue. I also urge  the  MOE  to\r\n\r\nattach  more  importance to the inculcation  of  culture  and\r\n\r\nvalues  in  the contents of our mother tongue education,  and\r\n\r\nthereby  enhance the students' knowledge in their own culture\r\n\r\nand history.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind Members to be short, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, two to three years\r\n\r\nago,  the  Minister  chaired  the  committee  to  review  the\r\n\r\nteaching of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalay  Language in schools.  It was part of a general  review\r\n\r\nof the teaching of mother tongue in our schools.  Some of the\r\n\r\nkey   recommendations  were  to  modify  the  curriculum  and\r\n\r\ntextbooks, also to introduce a third stream, or to  give  the\r\n\r\noption  to do an examination in Tamil Language B.  The  other\r\n\r\nrecommendation was to enhance the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language\r\n\r\nCentre as a place for the learning of Higher Tamil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my first question is whether the Minister could\r\n\r\ngive  us  a  progress report on the implementation  of  those\r\n\r\nrecommendations and, in particular, on how the upgrading  and\r\n\r\nimprovement  of  the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language  Centre  has\r\n\r\nprogressed and the response of teachers and students to  that\r\n\r\nnew  facility.   The  second question I  have  is,  based  on\r\n\r\nfeedback,  whilst we have modified curriculum and  textbooks,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  perception certainly among many parents,  whose\r\n\r\nchildren take Tamil as a second language, that the assessment\r\n\r\nsystem, whether it is examination or school-based tests,  has\r\n\r\nnot   reflected   the   change  of  the  curriculum   content\r\n\r\nadequately.   This  is  quite a systematic  feedback  and  it\r\n\r\noccurs   both   at  the  levels  where  there  are   national\r\n\r\nexaminations,   like   P4,  P6,  as  well   as   school-based\r\n\r\nexaminations  at other levels.   Sir, I would  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Ministry has a process by which the  curriculum\r\n\r\nchanges and the textbook changes will feed through to have  a\r\n\r\nmaterial impact on the examinations and assessments  that  we\r\n\r\nhave for the mother tongue and, in particular, Tamil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect, Sir, pertains to access to mother\r\n\r\ntongue and specifically Tamil Language.  Sir, Higher Tamil is\r\n\r\noffered  in,  perhaps, two or maybe three  secondary  schools\r\n\r\ntoday - Raffles Institution, RGS, and, possibly, Cedar, I may\r\n\r\nbe wrong there.  The other students are required to go to the\r\n\r\nTamil  Language Centre and take up Higher Tamil.   While  the\r\n\r\nfacility  is  well  appreciated,  it  does  mean  that  these\r\n\r\nstudents have to take time away from school which means  they\r\n\r\neither miss out on CCA, or they miss out on remedial classes,\r\n\r\nor  other  enrichment  classes,  in  order  to  pursue  their\r\n\r\ninterest in Higher\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTamil.   The question is not perhaps that Higher Tamil should\r\n\r\nbe  ubiquitous and offered in all schools.  But in additional\r\n\r\nschools  where  there  might  be  a  critical  mass  of  such\r\n\r\nstudents,  could we reconsider offering it  in  situ  in  the\r\n\r\nschools itself?  One example could be Crescent Girls where  I\r\n\r\nhave  received feedback that there are at least  20  students\r\n\r\nwho are taking Higher Tamil.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Singapore is an\r\n\r\nimmigrant society.  The plural ways of life have been part of\r\n\r\nour  living  here.  Against this background, it is  indeed  a\r\n\r\ngreat  challenge for us to preserve the co-existence  of  the\r\n\r\nplural ways of life among the ethnic groups while pursuing to\r\n\r\nbuild  a  strong  nationhood.  To  a  different  extent,  the\r\n\r\nvarious ethnic groups are facing a common problem, and it  is\r\n\r\nhow to preserve and protect their own language and culture in\r\n\r\na  predominantly English-speaking environment, so  that  they\r\n\r\nwill not be further eroded and even subjugated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In form, the Government's policy appears to favour\r\n\r\nbilingualism, but in substance it is undoubtedly, \"English is\r\n\r\nsupreme!\"    We do admit that the use of English is conducive\r\n\r\nto the interaction among the ethnic groups and enhances their\r\n\r\nmutual   understanding.  But,  do  we  really  want   to   be\r\n\r\nnaturalised  by the English language to become  a  homogenous\r\n\r\npeople?    That  is  an  entirely  different  matter.   While\r\n\r\nprojecting our common destiny as Singaporeans, I believe each\r\n\r\nethnic group also hopes to preserve and retain its own way of\r\n\r\nlife,  its  own  language and culture.  We  also  agree  that\r\n\r\nEnglish  is  useful to us in making a living in  this  highly\r\n\r\ncompetitive  global economy.  However, do we really  want  to\r\n\r\njust  earn  a living and give up our own way of  life?   What\r\n\r\nabout  our  cultural characteristics?  I believe the  various\r\n\r\nethnic  groups of this generation are unwilling  to  see  our\r\n\r\nsociety  losing  its  present  multi-cultural  flavours,   or\r\n\r\ndegenerate into a language and cultural form which is without\r\n\r\nsubstance.   After  all, this is the precious  asset  of  our\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must strike a balance between the nation and the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  and  between  economic development  and  cultural\r\n\r\nheritage.  This is a major issue we must explore  into.   The\r\n\r\nsignificance  and  importance of this kind of  soul-searching\r\n\r\nare  not inferior to the review of our economic strategy.   I\r\n\r\nfeel that the model of seeking similarity while accommodating\r\n\r\ndiversity, mutual tolerance and understanding, plurality  and\r\n\r\nco-existence  is  far  superior  to  the  singular  model  of\r\n\r\n\"English-only\",  and  is  better  able  to  consolidate   our\r\n\r\nfoundation  in building up a multi-racial nation. The  deeper\r\n\r\nthe  understanding of the various ethnic groups in their  own\r\n\r\nlanguage  and culture, the more positive effect it will  have\r\n\r\nin the process of our nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, because of political reasons, the Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity was not able to comprehensively discuss and resolve\r\n\r\nthe problem of its own language and culture. As a result, the\r\n\r\nstandard   of   Chinese  among  the  younger  generation   of\r\n\r\nSingaporean  Chinese  is consistently on  the  decline.  They\r\n\r\ndisregard  and even despise their own language  and  culture.\r\n\r\nThis question comes on from time to time. After being left in\r\n\r\nthe  doldrums  for  some time, it resurfaced  again  recently\r\n\r\nbecause of a few incidents of mistakes in the translation  of\r\n\r\nsome  official publications. It goes to show that the problem\r\n\r\ndoes  exist. We have to look at it squarely.  These incidents\r\n\r\nof  mistakes  in  translation are certainly not  an  isolated\r\n\r\nphenomenon.  It  reflects our society's typical  mindset  and\r\n\r\nstyle  towards the Chinese language. So long as this  mindset\r\n\r\nremains  unchanged, I will not be surprised if this  sort  of\r\n\r\n\"classic jokes\" or \"national disgrace\" are repeated again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the problem we are facing is purely the decline in\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of  Chinese  language,  then  the  remedy   is\r\n\r\nrelatively  easy  to find.  Unfortunately, the  problem  lies\r\n\r\nwith  the  mindset or mentality towards the Chinese language,\r\n\r\nand  this  kind  of mindset is quite common. We  should  ask,\r\n\r\n\"While  some  communities in the world are sacrificing  their\r\n\r\nlives  to  protect  and  defend  their  cultural  and  ethnic\r\n\r\nidentity,  why  are our young people despising or  abandoning\r\n\r\ntheir  own  mother tongue, the most important link  to  one's\r\n\r\ncultural and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nethnic  identity with absolutely no psychological  burden  at\r\n\r\nall?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education said that it would take three\r\n\r\ngenerations before a society can truly claim to be proficient\r\n\r\nin   a   language.  Singapore  needs  another  one-and-a-half\r\n\r\ngeneration  before  English can be extensively  used  by  the\r\n\r\nentire  society.  Regrettably  in  less  than  one-and-a-half\r\n\r\ngeneration,  the  status  of the  Chinese  language  here  is\r\n\r\nalready in a very precarious situation. In another one-and-a-half  generation's time when English is universally  used  by\r\n\r\nthe  entire society, what will be the position of the Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage  then?   If  we do not do something  about  it,  the\r\n\r\nconsequences  will  be quite obvious.  As  far  as  the  many\r\n\r\nintellects  who  take  the destiny of Chinese  to  heart  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, they have already said all that they need to  say,\r\n\r\nand  have probably done all that they ought to do. Yet,  such\r\n\r\nindividual  efforts  are  incapable  of  changing   the   big\r\n\r\nenvironment,  because this big environment  is  set   by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  educational policy and the  society's  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  the  language is influenced by such  an  educational\r\n\r\npolicy. Moreover, whenever the Chinese community talks  about\r\n\r\nthe Chinese language and Chinese culture, it will be labelled\r\n\r\nas being Chinese chauvinists.  We are still living under this\r\n\r\nkind of shadow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government claims the low standard of Chinese is the\r\n\r\nresult  of  the parents' own free choice, and is a  price  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  pay for our economic development.  I am  unable  to\r\n\r\nagree  with this argument. The crux of the matter undoubtedly\r\n\r\nlies  with  the attitude of our people towards  their  mother\r\n\r\ntongue.   Such  an  attitude  is  the  result  of   the   PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment's  social engineering over the past 30-odd  years.\r\n\r\nIt  has  fundamentally altered and even severed the emotional\r\n\r\nties  between  the people and their mother tongue.  They  are\r\n\r\ntreating  the  language entirely by a so-called rational  and\r\n\r\nutilitarian principle.  Some may call it \"pragmatic  policy\",\r\n\r\nbut  I  will  call it the \"rootless policy\". It is  a  policy\r\n\r\nwhereby English reigns supreme.  That being the case, why  do\r\n\r\nwe  not just simply embrace the western civilisation?  If  in\r\n\r\nthe fields of technology, humanity and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nculture, we can thoroughly and effectively arrive at the  way\r\n\r\nit  is  done in the west, then we may well consider it as  an\r\n\r\nalternative.  However, if after careful consideration we find\r\n\r\nthat it is not possible for us to embark on such a path, then\r\n\r\nshould  we  not  accord our own mother  tongue  language  and\r\n\r\nculture the status and respect it deserves?  We should not be\r\n\r\nbashful about it. Otherwise, we may end up \"neither fish  nor\r\n\r\nfowl\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no point to pinpoint who is to blame for all\r\n\r\nthese. The most important thing is that we must have a  clear\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  what our present situation  is.  Recognise\r\n\r\nthat this is indeed a problem. Deal with it seriously. Adjust\r\n\r\nthe  mindset. Shake off the over-sensitiveness in  discussing\r\n\r\nissues  concerning  the Chinese language. Then  mobilise  the\r\n\r\nresources of the Chinese community, and take advantage of the\r\n\r\ncollective  wisdom, and genuinely strive to  improve  on  the\r\n\r\npresent situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should discard the adverse effect of the\r\n\r\ntoo pragmatic attitude on the choice of culture and language.\r\n\r\nRecognise   the  pluralism  of  our  society.  Our   cultural\r\n\r\nfoundation shall never be built on the English language.  The\r\n\r\npassing on of cultural heritage from generation to generation\r\n\r\nrequires firm mother tongue foundation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Low, you have taken up your five\r\n\r\nminutes.

In the past two or three months, we have  seen  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  the  articles of this nature in the Lianhe  Zaobao's\r\n\r\neditorial  and  forum pages. In our exchanges  with  the  NUS\r\n\r\nChinese   Department,   the   Singapore   Chinese   Teachers'\r\n\r\nAssociation and the media, we keep hearing the same voice  of\r\n\r\nconcern.    For  example,  the  many  mistakes   in   Chinese\r\n\r\ntranslations in some of our official publications have become\r\n\r\na  laughing stock, and the fact that some  undergraduates  in\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  Department of NUS had to use  Hanyu  Pinyin  in\r\n\r\ntheir  examination papers because they had forgotten  how  to\r\n\r\nwrite the Chinese characters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general feeling is that while most Singapore Chinese\r\n\r\ncould speak simple Chinese in casual conversations, they  are\r\n\r\ncompletely  off  the  mark  where  reading  and  writing  are\r\n\r\nconcerned. Many Singapore businessmen find themselves  unable\r\n\r\nto communicate with their business partners in China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does the problem lie? First, it would be the\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Because in our environment where English is the\r\n\r\nmain  working  language, there are not many opportunities  to\r\n\r\nspeak Chinese, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot much importance is attached to the Chinese language here.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the curriculum time for the learning of Chinese  is\r\n\r\nreduced. Chinese is regarded as a subject and not a medium of\r\n\r\ninstruction. In Primary 1, the time spent on Chinese is  only\r\n\r\n1/3,  in Primary 4, only 1/5, and in secondary school, it  is\r\n\r\neven  less.   Thirdly,  with  the  retirement  of  the  older\r\n\r\ngeneration  of  Chinese  teachers,  we  are  now   short   of\r\n\r\nspecialist  Chinese  teachers who could  teach  the  language\r\n\r\nwell.  Fourthly, the mentality of the students.  The students\r\n\r\nare  treating  Chinese  as  an  examination  subject.   After\r\n\r\ngraduating, they just throw it aside.  Fifthly, the  teaching\r\n\r\nmethod and curriculum. These were already mentioned by Mr Yeo\r\n\r\nGuat Kwang earlier on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the question is how are we going to improve on all\r\n\r\nthese areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I think the Government leaders should give a\r\n\r\nvery  clear instruction and send a clear signal to raise  the\r\n\r\nstatus  of  Chinese  in  our  society.   For  example,   more\r\n\r\nimportance should be attached to the official publications in\r\n\r\nthe Chinese language.  They should be carefully monitored and\r\n\r\nvetted before they are sent to the printers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have to improve the quality of our Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers.  We must have specialist Chinese teachers, starting\r\n\r\nfrom  primary  school onwards.  We should also send  them  to\r\n\r\nsome well-known overseas universities to improve themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, they should teach Chinese in a more interesting\r\n\r\nmanner, as mentioned by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang earlier on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, to further raise the standard of Chinese in\r\n\r\nthe  SAP  schools and encourage the students  to  learn  more\r\n\r\nprofoundly  the  Chinese  culture,  history,   language   and\r\n\r\nphilosophy.  We could perhaps cooperate with the NUS  Chinese\r\n\r\nDepartment to work out something along this line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, we should let the graduates from our NUS\r\n\r\nChinese Department  play\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan important role in our society.  If we want to benefit from\r\n\r\nthe  emerging  Chinese economy, we should  give  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage in Singapore a boost in the arm.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the lowering of\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of Chinese language in Singapore  has  been  a\r\n\r\ncause   for   concern  among  the  Chinese  community   here.\r\n\r\nEspecially   of   late,   when  the  tourism   pamphlet   was\r\n\r\nmisinterpreted and has created a joke out of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speak Mandarin Campaign has been in place for many\r\n\r\nyears.  The  main objective of this campaign is how  to  make\r\n\r\nMandarin  the  medium  of  communication  among  the  various\r\n\r\ndialect groups in the Chinese community in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our schools, most of the students are able to speak\r\n\r\nand listen to Mandarin.  There is no problem about that.  But\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  writing,  they have  a  lot  of  problems  and\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  In order to raise the standard of the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage,  much will depend on the Government's effort.   The\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Chinese  Clans Association  and  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity  itself  must also put in more efforts  to  conduct\r\n\r\nclasses, hold seminars, discussion sessions and workshops for\r\n\r\nthe improvement of the Chinese language in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, we must start from the schools. This is a\r\n\r\nlong-term  approach to the raising of the  Chinese  language.\r\n\r\nIn  primary schools, there are a lot of opportunities for the\r\n\r\nlearning of English.  But in the case of Chinese language, it\r\n\r\nis  only confined to teaching within the subject.  We  cannot\r\n\r\narouse  the interest of the students in the learning  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  language. In fact, many students treat the  learning\r\n\r\nof the Chinese language as a chore and feel that it is a very\r\n\r\ndifficult  subject to learn.  As a result of  such  attitude,\r\n\r\nthe standard of Chinese remains very low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should include some interesting stories, such as how\r\n\r\nthe ancient sage in China, by the name of Sima Guang, broke a\r\n\r\nlarge water vat to rescue a boy who\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad fallen into it, and another boy, by the name of Kong Rong\r\n\r\nwho,  being  the  youngest  in the family,  was  offered  the\r\n\r\nlargest  of the pears in the tray. He graciously refused  the\r\n\r\noffer and said that since he was the youngest, he should only\r\n\r\ntake  the smallest one, and the biggest pear should be  given\r\n\r\nto  the  eldest brother.  Stories like these are  interesting\r\n\r\nand  inspiring. They could inculcate in our young the correct\r\n\r\nvalues  while capturing their attention with the  interesting\r\n\r\ncontents.   Incidentally, the name of Sima Guang was  changed\r\n\r\nto  Ali  in  our  local  textbook, but this  has  since  been\r\n\r\nrectified by MOE.  We cannot just change the names  of  well-known  characters  in  the Chinese  history  at  random.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  we cannot change the name of Justice Bao to  Kumar,\r\n\r\nor  Dr Sun Yat Sen to Robert Sun.  This will not reflect  the\r\n\r\nphilosophy and the culture that they represent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from teaching the students how to read and write\r\n\r\nthe  language,  we  must  also teach  them  the  culture  and\r\n\r\nphilosophy  behind the language.  Besides the textbooks,  the\r\n\r\neditorials  and the feature articles in the newspapers  could\r\n\r\nalso  be  used as materials for discussion in the  classroom.\r\n\r\nStudents  will then also learn to understand current  affairs\r\n\r\nin  the  process.   They can be encouraged to  express  their\r\n\r\nviews  on  these current affairs using the Chinese  language.\r\n\r\nSuch  application  will strengthen their proficiency  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese language.  The schools can also encourage students to\r\n\r\nwatch  good programmes in the cinemas or on Channel  8.   For\r\n\r\nexample, one programme is Who Wants to be a Millionnaire?  It\r\n\r\nis  a  good programme.  It enriches the general knowledge  of\r\n\r\nthe  students  and  can  also enhance  the  interest  in  the\r\n\r\nlearning  of the Chinese language.  Such programmes  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  help  students  to better  understand  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should encourage the students who are better in the\r\n\r\nChinese  language  to  take up Higher  Chinese.   With  China\r\n\r\nopening up successfully, and with strong economic growth,  we\r\n\r\nmust encourage our people to jump onto the bandwagon.  But if\r\n\r\nour  standard of Chinese is low, then we will not be able  to\r\n\r\nsucceed in China.  For\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample,  when it comes to signing of agreements in  Chinese,\r\n\r\nwe will have problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With proper learning of the Chinese language and\r\n\r\nculture,  the  students will be better-equipped  to  take  on\r\n\r\nChina  as the future engine of growth. The Chinese Department\r\n\r\nof NUS can play a greater role in this respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ang, finish your speech, please.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> Sir, can I have another two minutes?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Half a minute.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I believe that we must\r\n\r\ncorrect  the   attitude of the students on Chinese  language.\r\n\r\nGive them more training to enhance the value of Chinese.  The\r\n\r\nChinese  community should organise more cultural  activities.\r\n\r\nThe  various Government departments should emphasise  on  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  Chinese  language. MPs who  are  conversant  in\r\n\r\nMandarin, should speak more in Mandarin. The TV media  should\r\n\r\nintroduce   more  educational  programmes.    Through   these\r\n\r\nchannels,  we  will be able to enhance the  standard  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese language in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Teachers play\r\n\r\nsignificant  roles  in  ensuring that  our  students  receive\r\n\r\nproper  guidance  and quality education in schools.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave  proposed  in this House before that we need  a  quality\r\n\r\naccreditation system, such as the ISO 9000 in the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  and  our  schools.  This will  provide  consistent\r\n\r\nquality  assurance  in our education system.   It  will  also\r\n\r\nbenchmark   our   education   services   with   international\r\n\r\nstandards.  We need a quality system to make sure that  there\r\n\r\nare  quality policies and procedures in place in our  schools\r\n\r\nand  in the Ministry.  Sir, we need quality input and quality\r\n\r\nprocess to produce quality output.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, the Ministry has been actively\r\n\r\nrecruiting  many  new  teachers to  address  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nteacher  shortage  and  replacing retiring  teachers.   I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned about the quality of teachers recruited, especially\r\n\r\nduring  the recession.  Sir, I hope the Minister could update\r\n\r\nthe House on the recruitment process of teachers and what are\r\n\r\nthe  quality criteria for teachers.  I would also like to ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister the following questions:  One, how many teachers\r\n\r\nwere  recruited over the last five years, and how  many  have\r\n\r\nleft  the  Ministry?  Two, what is the long-term strategy  to\r\n\r\nattract good quality teachers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, this subject of\r\n\r\nclass  size is not a new issue.  I have brought up this issue\r\n\r\nof class size many times in this House.  As a former teacher,\r\n\r\nI  know  that it is impossible to teach effectively  a  class\r\n\r\nsize  of  40-44  pupils.  I am certain the Minister  is  also\r\n\r\naware  of this.  But, year after year, the Minister adamantly\r\n\r\ndefends  the  huge class size that we have in our  Government\r\n\r\nschools,  except  the independent schools where  the  average\r\n\r\nclass size is much smaller, at about 25 pupils per class.  25\r\n\r\npupils  per class is a good class size.  But I am only asking\r\n\r\nfor  a  reduction from the present average of 40  pupils  per\r\n\r\nclass   to  30  pupils  per  class.   This  is  a  reasonable\r\n\r\ncompromise between an educationally acceptable class size and\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  building  more schools  and  the  problems  of\r\n\r\nrecruitment of more teachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that much of our problems of low education\r\n\r\namongst a large section of our workforce can be traced to our\r\n\r\nlarge class size that is still found in our schools.  Despite\r\n\r\nrigorous  streaming in our schools, there are still  sizeable\r\n\r\ndropouts  from  our schools at the Primary 6  and  the  lower\r\n\r\nsecondary  school levels.  These children normally come  from\r\n\r\nnon-English  speaking  homes.   The  English  language  is  a\r\n\r\nforeign  language to them and, due mainly to lack  of  family\r\n\r\nsupport,  they  just cannot cope with the  English  language,\r\n\r\nneither can the teachers in the schools help them because  of\r\n\r\nthe  large class size. The teachers do not have the  time  in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  class size to give more individual attention to  the\r\n\r\nslower pupils in the class. They, therefore, year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter  year, fail badly in their English language  tests  and\r\n\r\nother  subjects.  In fact, English language to  these  pupils\r\n\r\nhas  never  really taken root.  They will join  the  pool  of\r\n\r\ndropouts in our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that at least this year, the Minister will say\r\n\r\nthat he recognises that large class size is a problem in  our\r\n\r\nschools  and  the  Ministry shall start  to  look  into  this\r\n\r\nproblem, rather than brushing it off year after year and hope\r\n\r\nthat this problem shall go away.  Unfortunately, it shall not\r\n\r\ngo away unless the Ministry does something about it.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I understand\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's problem in wanting to recruit  more  teachers\r\n\r\nand to double the number of schools if they are to reduce the\r\n\r\nclass size.  We are not talking about doubling or reducing  a\r\n\r\nclass  size  by  50%.  I also understand  that  the  Minister\r\n\r\nactually understands that certain subjects like English would\r\n\r\nbe  most  beneficial if the class size is smaller.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to urge the Ministry to consider reducing class size for\r\n\r\nthis subject in particular.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a small class size is the first step in the right\r\n\r\ndirection.   It  gives  more  individual  attention  to   the\r\n\r\nstudents in their learning and practice of this language and,\r\n\r\nalso  at  the same time, reduces the workload and demands  on\r\n\r\nthe  teachers.   The  learning of  English  is  very  much  a\r\n\r\npractice  subject and individual attention  of  the  teachers\r\n\r\nwould  be  there  to help spot grammar mistakes  and  correct\r\n\r\npronunciation errors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a shortage of good English teachers in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  will  support the  Ministry  in  its  overseas\r\n\r\nrecruitment   for  more  qualified  native-speaking   English\r\n\r\nteachers  to  come and teach our children.  In  view  of  the\r\n\r\nimportance of good English language in our society,  and  the\r\n\r\ngenerally weaker English language foundation of our  students\r\n\r\nentering  the neighbourhood schools, I hope the Ministry  can\r\n\r\nstart  and  put more emphasis on the reduction of class  size\r\n\r\nfor this particular subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, before the PAP came to power,\r\n\r\nnearly  all Chinese schools were private schools.  They  were\r\n\r\nknown  as  private  schools because they were  all  privately\r\n\r\nfunded  and administered.  Nowadays, all schools in Singapore\r\n\r\nare  Government schools except for the foreign schools  which\r\n\r\nare all private schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Government schools are centrally controlled and\r\n\r\nsupervised  by  the  Ministry of  Education.   Our  so-called\r\n\r\nIndependent schools are really not independent at all.   They\r\n\r\nare  very  much controlled and regulated by the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.   Since our schools are centrally controlled,  one\r\n\r\nwould  expect  that  there is uniformity  in  all  Government\r\n\r\nschools in Singapore.  All our children wear uniforms in  our\r\n\r\nschools up to the level of junior colleges and the curriculum\r\n\r\nand  syllabuses  of  all  Government schools,  as  one  would\r\n\r\nexpect, are fairly narrow, restricted and uniform.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all developed countries like England and\r\n\r\nAmerica,  private schools blossom in those countries.   Those\r\n\r\nschools are privately run, and are dynamic and vibrant.  They\r\n\r\nproduce outstanding students who serve their countries  well.\r\n\r\nI  think we should also encourage private schools to be built\r\n\r\nin our country in the light of Singapore wanting to encourage\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship.   The Government must change  its  attitude\r\n\r\nand  be  more  liberal.  The Education Act must  be  amended,\r\n\r\ntogether  with  its  related laws,  to  make  it  easier  for\r\n\r\nenlightened Singaporeans, who wish to set up private  schools\r\n\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think funds are not the real problem. The obstacle is\r\n\r\nthe   reluctance  of  the  Government  to  encourage  private\r\n\r\nschools.  All private schools we see in Singapore are set  up\r\n\r\nby  the  foreign  communities here.   If  funds  are  not  an\r\n\r\nobstacle to foreigners building their own private schools  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   why   should  funds  be  a  problem   to   local\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who outnumber the foreigners?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nour  national schools provide excellent opportunities for our\r\n\r\nchildren to mix and integrate.  They\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  the  common  grounds for our children to experience  and\r\n\r\nexplore  our  commonalties and, at the same time,  appreciate\r\n\r\nour apparent differences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the natural reaction is for our children to\r\n\r\ngravitate  among their own kind.  Children's minds  are  most\r\n\r\nimpressionable when they are still in school.  Value  systems\r\n\r\nand  social  behaviours are often shaped through  such  early\r\n\r\nexperiences in schools.  Given the backdrop of September  11,\r\n\r\nand the increasing need to enhance inter-ethnic understanding\r\n\r\nand  appreciation among our people, we must ensure  that  our\r\n\r\nschools  continue  to  provide a  conducive  environment  for\r\n\r\nstudents  to  mix, and mix well.  To this end, Sir,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister the following questions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What in the Minister's assessment is the current\r\n\r\nlevel of inter-ethnic integration in our schools today?  From\r\n\r\na  scale of 1 to 10, where are we?  What would be some of his\r\n\r\ncriteria in making such an assessment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Are there differences in the levels of inter-ethnic\r\n\r\nintegration  in  the  different types  of  schools,  eg,  the\r\n\r\nIndependent   schools,  neighbourhood   schools,   autonomous\r\n\r\nschools and the SAP schools?  If there are differences,  what\r\n\r\nare the Ministry's plans to improve the situation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What does the Ministry plan to do with the schools\r\n\r\nthat  have a lower proportion of ethnic minorities?  How  can\r\n\r\ninter-ethnic  integration be enhanced in  these  schools?   I\r\n\r\nthink more needs to be done than merely expecting them to mix\r\n\r\nthrough  the  school cluster system, where  students  in  the\r\n\r\ncluster  of schools get to mix through some joint  events  or\r\n\r\nfunctions. There must be a concerted effort that ensures  the\r\n\r\nprocess is continuous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What are the programmes that have been put in place\r\n\r\nto ensure better inter-ethnic integration in our schools?  We\r\n\r\nhave to go beyond the programmes that see our children put on\r\n\r\neach  other's ethnic costumes during Racial Harmony Day.   If\r\n\r\nthere are such programmes, what are the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noutcome  indicators of these programmes, ie,  how  would  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  determine the success of these  programmes?   Where\r\n\r\nare  we today in terms of these indicators?  What do we  hope\r\n\r\nto achieve in the immediate and the long-term future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Have there been studies that document the level of\r\n\r\ninter-ethnic  integration in our schools to  date?   If  yes,\r\n\r\nwhat are the findings? And if no, is the Ministry planning to\r\n\r\nconduct one such study?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we certainly cannot take our inter-ethnic\r\n\r\nrelationship  for  granted.   This  relationship,  like   our\r\n\r\nchildren,  is the cornerstone of our future.  Our  children's\r\n\r\nformative years in school will have significant influence  on\r\n\r\ntheir attitudes and perceptions in their adult lives.  I have\r\n\r\ncome  across  many university undergraduates, who  know  very\r\n\r\nlittle  about  the top cultural values and practices  of  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  ethnic  groups.   When  given  an  assignment   to\r\n\r\ninterview people who are ethnically different from them, many\r\n\r\nhave  difficulties, even when the assignment allows  them  to\r\n\r\ninterview people who they already know. This seems to suggest\r\n\r\nthat  these  undergraduates  do  not  know  people  who   are\r\n\r\nethnically  different from them as  part  of  their  network.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  hope this is not a result of what happened in  their\r\n\r\nearlier schooling years.  These undergraduates are our future\r\n\r\nleaders.    We   must  ensure  that  such  trends   are   not\r\n\r\nperpetuated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, we must invest in the formative years of\r\n\r\nour  children  to ensure that their experiences are  positive\r\n\r\nand  meaningful, thereby guaranteeing a future generation  of\r\n\r\nsocially    conscious    and   inter-ethnically    networking\r\n\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,\r\n\r\nschools, no doubt, play a key role to instill racial harmony.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding what multi-racialism is about in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\ncritical,  if we are serious about integration. Despite  over\r\n\r\n36  years of our efforts at nation-building, there are  still\r\n\r\nserious gaps of understanding and misunderstanding about what\r\n\r\nit takes to make a success of multi-racialism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is MOE's experience in tackling this problem and at\r\n\r\npromoting integration?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay MPs, sometime back, had taken the initiative\r\n\r\nto  request  that there be a cap of 25% admission to  Primary\r\n\r\nOne  intake,  the  purpose being to encourage  better  inter-racial  mixing and to facilitate more Malay students  to  use\r\n\r\nEnglish rather than just Malay language among themselves.   I\r\n\r\nrealise   that   there  are  practical  problems,   including\r\n\r\nconvenience and transportation, that made parents request for\r\n\r\nmore  admission despite the cap.  What is MOE's  position  on\r\n\r\nthat  cap now?  I think, as far as possible, that cap  should\r\n\r\nbe encouraged for better performance and integration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, it was brought to our attention that certain\r\n\r\nschools,  for  example, Siglap Secondary  School,  had  Malay\r\n\r\nstudents  reaching  60% of the student  population.  This,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, was because of the post-PSLE posting and choice made\r\n\r\nby  the  students themselves.  I gather too that  in  certain\r\n\r\nclasses  in  such schools, the number of Malay students  even\r\n\r\nreached  90%.  I was also told that once such schools  attain\r\n\r\nsuch   an   image,  non-Malay  students,  especially  Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents,  even  refrain  from  choosing  such  schools   for\r\n\r\nposting.   Is  this  true,  Sir?  What  effect  does  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation have on our efforts at integration?  Will  MOE  try\r\n\r\nto  have a better spread of students to make the schools more\r\n\r\nmultiracial and thus, facilitate integration?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge MOE to view the matter seriously\r\n\r\nand not allow expediency, eg, convenience of language classes\r\n\r\nor  transport  consideration, to deter them from  efforts  to\r\n\r\nforge a better integrated society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

The mismatch of supply and demand  of\r\n\r\nschool placement often causes much anxiety among parents, who\r\n\r\nwill  thereafter make numerous appeals to the  school.   With\r\n\r\nfluctuating child births yearly, and rapid population shifts,\r\n\r\nit  is  difficult for the Ministry to forecast the demand  of\r\n\r\nschool placements in schools.  As such, we need to review the\r\n\r\nplanning  process  of  schools  to  better  cope  with   this\r\n\r\nfluctuating demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister the following questions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the measures taken by the Ministry to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  students  staying within 1 kilometre of a neighbourhood\r\n\r\nschool can have a place?\r\n\r\n(2)  Can schools be planned and built based on actual school\r\n\r\nplacement demand data obtained through an early school\r\n\r\nregistration system?\r\n\r\n(3)  Will the Ministry consider increasing the capacity of\r\n\r\nschools so as to cope with the yearly fluctuating demands for\r\n\r\nschool placements?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On school design, the development expenditure of $1.48\r\n\r\nbillion  in the building programme of schools and educational\r\n\r\ninstitutions must be carefully monitored to ensure that money\r\n\r\nis  appropriately spent to provide a conducive and functional\r\n\r\nlearning  environment for our students.

Strong  moral\r\n\r\nvalues  are  promoted through the Civics and Moral  Education\r\n\r\nprogramme.  Last year, we also announced a set of initiatives\r\n\r\nto  develop  and enhance arts education in our  schools.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the changes to the University Admission System  in\r\n\r\n2003  will  include  bonus points  for  CCA.   So  that  will\r\n\r\nreinforce other measures of ability and make CCA count.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh and Mdm Ho had spoken about the need to expose\r\n\r\nour  students  to  entrepreneurship, financial  planning  and\r\n\r\nstarting  up  businesses, for the  new  economy.   While  the\r\n\r\nspecific  skills  of financial planning  and  starting  up  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  are  not  an  integral part  of  the  programme  in\r\n\r\nschools, students do learn useful practical life-skills, such\r\n\r\nas    self-management,   social   and   cooperative   skills,\r\n\r\ncommunication, and information skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In co-curricular activities in particular, students have\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to organise challenging activities involving\r\n\r\nmanaging people, time and money.  Some schools have their own\r\n\r\ncooperatives,  for  example, Ping Yi.   And  Anderson  Junior\r\n\r\nCollege's Enterprise runs a gift shop in the college and  has\r\n\r\na  link-up  with  One.99 shops.  Students acquire  experience\r\n\r\nrunning a company and even raising business capital.  Temasek\r\n\r\nJunior  College, Mr Singh's alma mater, has an Entrepreneurs'\r\n\r\nClub  with  50  members learning about product marketing  and\r\n\r\nrisk  management from external instructors and  mentors,  and\r\n\r\nthey are trying to put their skills to work on some projects.\r\n\r\nWe  encourage  schools  to  provide  such  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nstudents,  but we leave it to schools to decide whether  such\r\n\r\nactivities fit into their overall programme and priorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main focus is really at the post secondary level,\r\n\r\nwhere  much  has already been done.  At ITE, entrepreneurship\r\n\r\ntraining is now part of the core training programme  for  all\r\n\r\nstudents, as it is in the polytechnics, particularly for  the\r\n\r\nengineering, IT and life sciences, the non-business  courses.\r\n\r\nNTU  has the Nanyang Technopreneurship Centre hosted  by  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  Business  School, and NUS  has  the  NUS  Enterprise\r\n\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also asked about the mother tongue policy.\r\n\r\nOn  one  end  of  the spectrum, we have Mr Sin  suggesting  a\r\n\r\nrelaxation  of mother tongue requirements, on the other  end,\r\n\r\nwe  have  Dr  Ong and others, highlighting the importance  of\r\n\r\nmother   tongue   and  that  it  cannot  be  over-emphasised.\r\n\r\nBilingualism  will  remain  a cornerstone  of  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem.   English  is  needed for the globalised,  knowledge-based  world,  and  as a common language to communicate  with\r\n\r\neach other across ethnic boundaries, and the mother tongue to\r\n\r\nimbibe values and appreciate our cultural heritage.  This  is\r\n\r\nour policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy is to encourage every Singaporean to study\r\n\r\nhis  mother tongue in school for as long as possible, and  to\r\n\r\nas high a level as he is capable of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang asked for a review of our mother tongue policy,\r\n\r\nto turn over this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstone.   It  was  indeed reviewed in 1999  by  a  high  level\r\n\r\ncommittee  chaired  by  DPM  Lee.   The  1999  mother  tongue\r\n\r\nlanguage  review made several recommendations to achieve  our\r\n\r\nobjectives.   The recommendations were carefully  calibrated,\r\n\r\nand we are just implementing them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognised that not all pupils have the same natural\r\n\r\nability,  home background and motivation.  We needed  a  more\r\n\r\ncustomised  approach, where we aim for  different  levels  of\r\n\r\nachievements for pupils of different abilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Wang has said, the growing proportion of English-speaking families, and the large difference home language\r\n\r\nbackground  makes,  means  that we  cannot  ignore  the  real\r\n\r\nproblems some children have learning the mother tongue.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  we  introduced the Mother Tongue B  syllabus.   This\r\n\r\nsyllabus focuses more on speaking and listening aspects,  and\r\n\r\nis  designed  to  make the attainment of  a  basic  level  of\r\n\r\ncompetency   in  mother  tongue  to  proceed  to   the   next\r\n\r\neducational  level  less of a hurdle for  students  who  face\r\n\r\nexceptional difficulties in learning their mother tongue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we also sought to enlarge the pool of\r\n\r\nstudents studying Higher Mother Tongue, so as to broaden  the\r\n\r\nbase  for a literary elite.  I agree with Dr Ong and  Mr  Ang\r\n\r\nthat  we  should  have high standards for the  mother  tongue\r\n\r\nlanguage.   Higher Mother Tongue is the standard  bearer  for\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  in  Singapore, and incentives  are  given  to\r\n\r\nencourage students who are strong in mother tongue  to  offer\r\n\r\nHigher Mother Tongue.  And these incentives include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Relaxing the eligibility criteria to allow more students\r\n\r\nto offer their Higher Mother Tongue, from what was 10% to now\r\n\r\nthe top 30% of a cohort;\r\n\r\n(2)  Providing 2 bonus points for Higher Mother Tongue for\r\n\r\nadmission to junior colleges, and bonus points for students\r\n\r\nwho perform well in mother tongue, or Higher Mother Tongue at\r\n\r\nA-level for admission to courses related to mother tongue\r\n\r\nlanguages in our local universities;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Increasing the number of Special Assistance Plan\r\n\r\n(SAP)  schools  from  9  to  10, and  introducing  a  special\r\n\r\nprogramme  called \"Elective Programme in Malay  Language  for\r\n\r\nSecondary  Schools (EMAS)\" at Bukit Panjang  Government  High\r\n\r\nSchool  as well as upgrading the Umar Pulavar Tamil  Language\r\n\r\nCentre  for the teaching of Higher Tamil and Tamil  Language.\r\n\r\nThis Centre which is now open  -  Mr Iswaran asked about this\r\n\r\n-  also serves as a national resource centre for the teaching\r\n\r\nand learning of Tamil Language.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also set up the third centre for the Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage elective programme at Nanyang JC, and introduced the\r\n\r\nMalay   elective  programme  at  Tampines  JC.    Outstanding\r\n\r\nstudents   are   awarded  the  language  elective   programme\r\n\r\nscholarships.  This more customised approach at both ends  of\r\n\r\nthe  spectrum   -  the lower achiever end mother  tongue  and\r\n\r\nhigher  achiever  end mother tongue  -   has  allowed  us  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  the standard of mother tongue that can be  attained\r\n\r\nby  the majority of students with reasonable effort.  And  we\r\n\r\nwill  review our mother tongue policies regularly  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat our policy objectives continue to be met.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo and Mr Ang spoke on Chinese language teaching and\r\n\r\nlearning.   We agree with them that it is important  to  make\r\n\r\nthe  learning  of  mother  tongue  languages,  including  the\r\n\r\nChinese  language,  not only effective but also  interesting.\r\n\r\nFollowing   the  Mother  Tongue  Reviews,  Chinese   Language\r\n\r\nsyllabuses  were revised, and new textbooks have been  phased\r\n\r\nin  by  level  from  the  year 2002.   Training  courses  and\r\n\r\nworkshops  on  the  use  of the new  materials  and  creative\r\n\r\nstrategies  on  the  teaching of Chinese Language  have  been\r\n\r\nconducted for teachers.  As Mr Yeo has said, today, more  and\r\n\r\nmore  Chinese  language teachers employ creative  and  lively\r\n\r\nteaching methods to cater to the needs of their students, and\r\n\r\nwe want to encourage this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be reviewing the modes of assessment and the\r\n\r\nexamination formats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  curriculum and assessment are  aligned  and\r\n\r\ngeared to achieving the learning outcomes of the new syllabi.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Mr Yeo's comment that the Ministry sets\r\n\r\ntoo  many restrictions on the teaching of the subject, I like\r\n\r\nto  clarify  that students are not required to  memorise  the\r\n\r\ncontent  of  the  text or the meanings of  words.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nteachers   are   encouraged   to  exercise   flexibility   in\r\n\r\ndetermining the modes of assessment when setting school-based\r\n\r\nexaminations for their students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran asked if the Ministry could allow a school\r\n\r\nwith  20  Indian students taking Higher Tamil to have school-based   Higher   Tamil  classes.   I  fully  understand   the\r\n\r\naspirations  of  parents who want to  see  Tamil  instruction\r\n\r\noffered in as many schools as possible, and the Ministry will\r\n\r\nstrive  to  do  this.  But if a school has only  20  students\r\n\r\noffering Higher Tamil across Secondary 1 to Secondary  4,  it\r\n\r\nmeans there will be, on average, only five students per level\r\n\r\noffering Higher Tamil.  I think this is too small a number to\r\n\r\njustify starting Higher Tamil classes in that school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Singh asked about non-Tamil Indian languages. At\r\n\r\npresent,   the  Ministry  conducts  examinations  for   these\r\n\r\nlanguages at PSLE, N levels, 'O' and 'A' levels.  And  grades\r\n\r\nobtained  at these national examinations are treated  on  the\r\n\r\nsame basis as the other official mother tongue languages.   I\r\n\r\nam  aware that the non-Tamil Indian speaking communities have\r\n\r\nmade  commendable  efforts to improve the teaching  of  their\r\n\r\nlanguages,  and  that they hope to persuade the  Ministry  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  non-Tamil  Indian  language  marks  in  the   five\r\n\r\ndifferent  languages  - Hindi, Punjabi,  Gujarati,  Urdu  and\r\n\r\nBengali   - for various purposes, on a comparable basis  with\r\n\r\nstudents taking the three official mother tongue languages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should say from the outset that those taking non-Tamil Indian languages have a dispensation that no other\r\n\r\ngroup\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans have.  Chinese Singaporeans are not  allowed\r\n\r\nto  offer  Cantonese or Hokkien nor Singaporeans of  Javanese\r\n\r\nextraction, Javanese.  All other Singaporeans are required to\r\n\r\noffer  one  of our three official mother tongue languages  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Schools  will  place students  taking  non-Tamil\r\n\r\nIndian languages in the appropriate classes, and assess their\r\n\r\neligibility  for  Edusave and other awards,  based  on  their\r\n\r\nability demonstrated by the students in their other subjects.\r\n\r\nStudents   are   therefore   not   unduly   advantaged    nor\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged  by  this.   Though we allow  non-Tamil  Indian\r\n\r\nlanguages  to  be  offered in lieu  of  the  official  mother\r\n\r\ntongues, we can make accommodations and arrangements only  up\r\n\r\nto a point.  I will ask my officials to work with the various\r\n\r\ngroups   offering  these  five  different  non-Tamil   Indian\r\n\r\nlanguages to discuss what can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the important subject of teachers, Mr Chiam and Mr\r\n\r\nChia  have  raised  the subject of pupil-teacher  ratios  and\r\n\r\nsmaller class sizes.  The issue of smaller class sizes is not\r\n\r\nnew.   It was something I discussed at length at last  year's\r\n\r\ndebate.   Mr Chia was not in this House then, and  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure  if  Mr  Chiam was present when I gave  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\nresponse  on this matter.  Nevertheless, this is a matter  on\r\n\r\nwhich Mr Chiam crows as often as the sun rises!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, we should have small classes, every one of\r\n\r\nwhich  would be taught by good teachers.  But, as I explained\r\n\r\nlast  year,  there  is a real trade-off between  quality  and\r\n\r\nquantity  of  teachers  - and this is a problem  which  every\r\n\r\ncountry faces, not just us, in the United States and the  UK,\r\n\r\nwhich  is coming to us and trying to recruit our teachers   - especially  when  we  take the desire to have  smaller  class\r\n\r\nsizes over the teacher numbers required for the entire school\r\n\r\nsystem.  It is actually not too difficult to double the  size\r\n\r\nof  the  teaching force.  All I have to do is  to  lower  the\r\n\r\nstandards  that  we  require of our teachers.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nshortage of applicants if we lower standards.  The choice  is\r\n\r\nnot  between  40  students taught by a good teacher  and  two\r\n\r\nclasses  of  20, each taught by an equally good teacher;  but\r\n\r\nhaving 20 of these 40 students\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  is perhaps not fit to teach by today's standards  for  a\r\n\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our approach to building up our teaching force is\r\n\r\nto  recruit  as  many  teachers that  we  can  who  meet  our\r\n\r\nstandards.  We take this issue of teacher-student ratios very\r\n\r\nseriously and we do not brush it aside.  We have not  limited\r\n\r\nthe  numbers  that we can recruit.  Through EduPac,  we  have\r\n\r\nmade a career in teaching more attractive and rewarding.   We\r\n\r\nhave  been  able  to expand the size of our  teaching  force,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  the last five years with some help  from  the\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo asked how many teachers we have recruited and our\r\n\r\nattrition  rates.  In the last five years, the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nbeen  able to recruit more than 2,000 teachers per year  into\r\n\r\nthe Education Service.  This is more than 10,000 teachers  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  five years in the teaching force of about  25,000.\r\n\r\nThe resignation rate of teachers has been fairly constant and\r\n\r\nlow,  between  2%  and 3% per year in the  last  five  years.\r\n\r\nHowever,  our  retirement rates have gone up,  as  the  large\r\n\r\nnumber  of  teachers recruited in the 1960s reach retirement.\r\n\r\nOver the next five years, 3,500 teachers will retire, or  700\r\n\r\nteachers a year.  On the whole, however, as a result  of  the\r\n\r\nhigher  recruitment numbers, the size of the teaching service\r\n\r\nhas  increased from about 22,500 teachers in  1997 to  24,500\r\n\r\nin  2001,  a  9%  increase.  In fact,  there  has  been  some\r\n\r\nimprovement of pupil-teacher ratios  -  not large, but  some.\r\n\r\nBut  because our target is to recruit our teachers  from  the\r\n\r\ntop one-third of each cohort, there is a limit to how far  we\r\n\r\ncan  reduce  pupil-teacher  ratios  without  compromising  on\r\n\r\nteacher quality.  At the recruitment rate of 2,000 per  year,\r\n\r\nwe  are already recruiting 1 out of every 8 of the top  third\r\n\r\nof  each  cohort.  And these new recruits have  to  stay,  on\r\n\r\naverage,  12.5 years in order to maintain the teaching  force\r\n\r\nat  the  current level of about 25,000 teachers.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  this is achievable, but I am not confident that we  can\r\n\r\nhave  a  dramatic increase in the size of our teaching  force\r\n\r\nwithout a significantly lowering of quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these constraints, our position on deploying our\r\n\r\nteacher resources is to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  so  where  the  additional teachers can  contribute  most\r\n\r\ntoward  the  learning of students.  Mr  Chia  said  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry should at least reduce class size for some subjects,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  English, so that students can get better  attention\r\n\r\nand  learn  better.  This is indeed what we are  doing.   One\r\n\r\ngood  example is the Learning Support Programme (LSP)   where\r\n\r\nPrimary  1  and 2 pupils with difficulties in basic  literacy\r\n\r\nskills  are  taught  in  small group sizes  of  8-12.   Using\r\n\r\nteacher  resources  for targeted programmes,  like  the  LSP,\r\n\r\nwhich  may mean smaller class sizes for specific subjects  or\r\n\r\nperiods for specific students, is more effective than to  try\r\n\r\nto reduce class sizes across the board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On private schools, Mr Tharman's committee is studying\r\n\r\nthis  subject  already, and I shall ask him to  take  special\r\n\r\nnote  that  Mr  Chiam supports the introduction of  privately\r\n\r\nfunded private schools, like the exclusive schools in the  UK\r\n\r\nand the US.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now ask my Parliamentary Secretary, Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi,  to  address issues on ethnic integration and  school\r\n\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Hawazi Daipi):</b> Sir, Dr Mohamad Maliki asked\r\n\r\nabout  programmes  to  promote ethnic integration  and  their\r\n\r\neffectiveness.   Mr  Zainul  Abidin  asked  whether  students\r\n\r\nappreciate the constraints and value the opportunities  of  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE actively promotes social cohesion among students of\r\n\r\ndifferent  races and different ability groups.  Our education\r\n\r\nsystem and our school programmes foster social cohesion among\r\n\r\nthe different races at every opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Dr Maliki that we have achieved a\r\n\r\nhigh level of acceptance and appreciation of ethnic diversity\r\n\r\nin  schools.   This is based on the National Education  Study\r\n\r\nwhich MOE has been conducting annually since 1997.  Findings,\r\n\r\nsince  the  1997  baseline  study, also  show  that  students\r\n\r\ngenerally  have a better appreciation of racial  harmony,  as\r\n\r\nthey proceed to the next higher level of their education.  We\r\n\r\nwill continue to strengthen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninter-racial understanding and mixing in schools through  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum,   co-curricular  activities   (CCA)   and   other\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through subjects like Civics and Moral Education, Social\r\n\r\nStudies  and History, the formal school curriculum emphasises\r\n\r\nappreciation  and  respect  for  the  cultures,  customs  and\r\n\r\ntraditions of the various ethnic communities in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has also developed and implemented the National\r\n\r\nEducation  (NE)  programme since 1997, which  aims  to  build\r\n\r\nnational cohesion and inculcate the instinct for survival and\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the  future.   It  reinforces  the  important\r\n\r\nmessage that Singapore is a multi-racial society.  As part of\r\n\r\nNE, schools set aside one day in the year -  21st July, to be\r\n\r\nprecise   - to commemorate Racial Harmony Day.  This  is  the\r\n\r\nday  when students reflect on and celebrate our success as  a\r\n\r\nharmonious  nation  built on a rich  diversity  of  cultures.\r\n\r\nSince  its inception, this commemorative event has proven  to\r\n\r\nbe  effective  in promoting inter-racial understanding  among\r\n\r\nour  students.   By learning about Singapore's  strengths  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  constraints and vulnerabilities,  through  subjects\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Social Studies, History and Geography, as  part  of\r\n\r\nNational  Education  and  through  other  National  Education\r\n\r\nactivities,  we  are  able  to deepen  understanding,  foster\r\n\r\ncomradeship  and  bonding  among students,  both  inside  and\r\n\r\noutside the classroom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Co-Curricular Activities programme also promotes\r\n\r\nsocial  integration, by providing avenues for  students  from\r\n\r\ndifferent social and racial backgrounds to engage in the same\r\n\r\nactivities.  Students train side by side in sports,  organise\r\n\r\nclub  activities in committees, and participate  actively  in\r\n\r\nhouse  competitions.  In the process, they get  to  know  one\r\n\r\nanother  better  and learn to support one  another  in  their\r\n\r\ncommon    endeavour.     This   enriches   students'   social\r\n\r\nexperiences  and enables them to have a better  understanding\r\n\r\nof the spectrum of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools on their own have also embarked on various\r\n\r\ninitiatives to knock\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndown  barriers  between  students of different  races.   Last\r\n\r\nyear,  for example, Ngee Ann Primary School set up  a  multi-racial  \"gamelan\" Malay Cultural Ensemble Group.   Nan  Chiau\r\n\r\nSecondary  School,  which  is a  Hokkien  Huay  Kuan  school,\r\n\r\nencourages its Secondary 1 Malay and Indian students to learn\r\n\r\nChinese calligraphy and Chinese painting.  There are numerous\r\n\r\nexamples  of  how  our  schools  have  been  able  to  foster\r\n\r\ncomradeship, and to foster closer rapport among  students  of\r\n\r\nvarious  ethnic backgrounds.  Schools within the same cluster\r\n\r\ncan  also  come  together  to  organise  joint  projects  and\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our national schools, students of different races and\r\n\r\nreligions  go  through a common curriculum,  share  a  common\r\n\r\nexperience of growing up together, studying together, playing\r\n\r\ntogether,  and  singing  the National  Anthem  together,  and\r\n\r\nreciting  the  Pledge  together.  These are  invaluable  life\r\n\r\nexperiences,   which   help  in  building   emotional   ties,\r\n\r\nidentification, and a sense of commitment to one  another  as\r\n\r\nfellow citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on strengthening of racial harmony in schools, we\r\n\r\nhave   been   successful  in  having  an  easy  and   relaxed\r\n\r\nrelationship  among  our communities in  Singapore.   In  the\r\n\r\naftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States,  and\r\n\r\nthe  heightened sensitivities to race and religion that  have\r\n\r\nfollowed,  we  need to further enhance racial  and  religious\r\n\r\nharmony   in  our  schools.   Let  me  highlight  two   major\r\n\r\ninitiatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One change that MOE is effecting that can enhance cross-cultural interaction is in the extension of its Third\r\n\r\nLanguage  programme.   PM announced recently  that,  starting\r\n\r\nfrom 2004, MOE will offer Chinese as a third language to non-Chinese  students with the aptitude for it, in the  same  way\r\n\r\nthat  Malay is now available as a third language to non-Malay\r\n\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE will also be relaxing the eligibility criteria for\r\n\r\nthe  existing  Malay as a Third Language programme,  so  that\r\n\r\nmore non-Malay students can qualify.  The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelaxed  criteria  will  also apply to  Chinese  as  a  Third\r\n\r\nLanguage programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has also set up the Committee on Strengthening\r\n\r\nRacial   Harmony   in   Schools   to   enhance   inter-racial\r\n\r\nunderstanding and mixing in schools, and organise  activities\r\n\r\nto  strengthen  racial  harmony in schools.   The  Committee,\r\n\r\nwhich I chair, comprises representatives from schools, parent\r\n\r\nsupport groups, and the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked for an update on the Committee's work.\r\n\r\nThe   Committee  aims  to  broaden  and  deepen  inter-racial\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and  mixing  in schools  through  articulating\r\n\r\ndesirable programmes and strategies, seeding initiatives  and\r\n\r\nraising the profile of Racial Harmony activities, such as the\r\n\r\ncelebration of Racial Harmony Day.  The Committee  will  also\r\n\r\nconsider  how  the  impact of racial harmony  initiatives  in\r\n\r\nschool could be assessed.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has come out with several preliminary\r\n\r\nideas to deepen understanding and mixing among students.  One\r\n\r\nway  is  to  raise the profile of the Racial Harmony  Day  by\r\n\r\norganising  an  annual  symbolic event  for  all  schools  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in.  This year, the event will  be  known  as  a\r\n\r\nRacial Harmony Games Day, to be celebrated on Saturday,  20th\r\n\r\nJuly,  to  promote inter-racial interaction through enjoyable\r\n\r\ngames.   Another  initiative is through the sharing  of  good\r\n\r\npractices  and  useful  resources from schools  and  external\r\n\r\norganisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul also shared with this House efforts by the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development  Councils to promote  racial  harmony.\r\n\r\nThe  Committee has noted that external organisations such  as\r\n\r\nCDCs  and  Parent Support Groups have a key role to  play  in\r\n\r\npromoting  racial harmony and suggests that schools  leverage\r\n\r\non  these  organisations  to maximise  efforts  in  promoting\r\n\r\nracial harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee will be meeting community leaders,\r\n\r\nparents,  teachers and principals in focus group  discussions\r\n\r\nto gather their views on how to broaden and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndeepen further inter-racial understanding and interaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Zainul asked about racial quotas for Primary One\r\n\r\nintake  in schools.  We tried implementing in 1987 a  Primary\r\n\r\nOne  racial quota where Primary One Malay student  intake  in\r\n\r\neach  school  was limited to 25%.  However, there  were  many\r\n\r\nimplementation problems.  The HDB's housing quota, introduced\r\n\r\nin  1989,  has  helped  to reduce the  problem  and  maintain\r\n\r\ncertain balance in our primary schools.  We will continue  to\r\n\r\nmonitor  the  situation and, if necessary,  see  what  action\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be  taken.  For secondary schools,  streaming  has\r\n\r\nhelped us to ensure a better mix of students in our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude on this point, let me just say that we\r\n\r\ntry  to  integrate  students  of various  ethnic  communities\r\n\r\nthrough  cultural activities and traditions of the  different\r\n\r\ncommunities  as well as through better mixing.  This  can  be\r\n\r\ndone  through  the curriculum, through outside the  classroom\r\n\r\nactivities, CCA, and enrichment programmes as well as through\r\n\r\nthe  National Education programme.  We celebrate  four  major\r\n\r\nevents   in   a   year  in  school  -  Racial  Harmony   Day,\r\n\r\nInternational  Friendship Day, Youth  Festival  and  National\r\n\r\nDay.   These are all activities which can prove to be  useful\r\n\r\nin strengthening further racial cohesion among our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about school planning and the\r\n\r\ndesign  of schools.  MOE plans the provision of school places\r\n\r\nsuch  that  no  child in Singapore will be  denied  a  school\r\n\r\nplace.   We  ensure that every Primary One-going  child  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  place  in  a  school in the  town  where  he  lives.\r\n\r\nHowever,  it is not possible to ensure that every child  will\r\n\r\nbe  placed  in a primary school located no further  than  one\r\n\r\nkilometre from where he lives.  To do this, we would need  to\r\n\r\nbuild many more primary schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In planning for the building of new schools, MOE takes\r\n\r\ninto  account  the  actual  number of  school-going  children\r\n\r\nliving  in  a town and potential demand due to new  residents\r\n\r\nmoving in, based on data from the Housing and Development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard.   MOE  does not just look at total demand  for  school\r\n\r\nplaces,  but  ensures that there will be enough  Primary  One\r\n\r\nplaces each year to cater to projected demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist students who move house and need a school\r\n\r\nplace nearer their new home, MOE conducts what we will call a\r\n\r\nStudent  Transfer  Exercise for Primary School  Children,  or\r\n\r\nSTEPS,  every  year,  to  facilitate their  transfer.   These\r\n\r\nstudents  should be able to get a school place  nearer  their\r\n\r\nhome, provided they have no specific choice of schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are sufficient vacancies for all, MOE\r\n\r\nrecognises that parental demand for places in popular schools\r\n\r\nwill  always  exceed available vacancies.  Where  demand  for\r\n\r\nplaces   exceeds  available  vacancies,  balloting  will   be\r\n\r\nconducted.  Allowing parents to register for Primary One  two\r\n\r\nyears  ahead of actual intake would not remove the  need  for\r\n\r\nballoting, as parents would still continue to opt for popular\r\n\r\nschools,  but two years earlier.  Hence, the \"Build-to-Order\"\r\n\r\napproach  is not likely to work for the provision  of  school\r\n\r\nplaces  since  parents would still not  be  guaranteed  of  a\r\n\r\nschool place for their children in the more popular schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on school design, school development projects are\r\n\r\nconstantly  guided  by design criteria that  are  crafted  to\r\n\r\nensure  value for money and that they meet users'  functional\r\n\r\nrequirements such as safety, flexibility and maintainability.\r\n\r\nSchool  designs are rigorously checked at various  stages  to\r\n\r\nensure  compliance  with our design parameters  and  standard\r\n\r\nspecifications.  Features that are not functional  or  costly\r\n\r\nto  build  and  maintain will be rejected.  Our  schools  are\r\n\r\nfunctional, and yet aesthetically pleasing, with each  having\r\n\r\na unique identity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Teo that durability and maintainability\r\n\r\nare  two  key  design  considerations in the  development  of\r\n\r\nschools.   Over the past five years, the buildability  scores\r\n\r\nof  our  schools have ranged from 72 to 77.  This  is  higher\r\n\r\nthan the requirement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  64  for  schools set by the Code of Practice on Buildable\r\n\r\nDesign  under the Building Control Act.  Based on the records\r\n\r\nof our managing agent, the maintenance cost of our schools is\r\n\r\ngenerally  lower,  at $9.40 per square  metre  per  year,  as\r\n\r\ncompared  with about $15 per square metre per year for  other\r\n\r\nlow-rise buildings maintained by them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Design and Build\" (D&B) is one of the contract\r\n\r\nprocurement methods used by both public and private  sectors,\r\n\r\nand  MOE has called a number of D&B contracts in the past for\r\n\r\nschool  projects.  When used, we will ensure overall  control\r\n\r\nof the design.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, on this cut, I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  talk  about  the  development  in  National\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore (NUS).  Many of us are alumni of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  and  we have very fond memories of  our  time  as\r\n\r\nstudents.   As such, the continued development of NUS  is  of\r\n\r\ngreat interest to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to the casual onlooker, one can discern that a\r\n\r\nreform  is  being implemented in NUS, which goes  beyond  the\r\n\r\nchange  of the title of Vice-Chancellor to President.   There\r\n\r\nwas  a newspaper report carried by Today, dated 19th February\r\n\r\n2002,  commenting on certain aspects of the changes currently\r\n\r\nongoing, under the title \"The Plain and the Gain\".  The paper\r\n\r\nlater  apologised, retracted the article in full and  without\r\n\r\nreservations on 2nd May.  Nonetheless, the fact remains  that\r\n\r\nthe  attrition of the faculties has been high in  year  2002,\r\n\r\nand  many  from these faculties are well-known names  in  the\r\n\r\nacademic circle in the Asia Pacific region.  This NUS  reform\r\n\r\nwas  also  described  by an article that appeared  in  Times,\r\n\r\nHigher   Education  Supplement,  dated  3rd  May   2002,   as\r\n\r\n\"Americanization\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Feedback Unit Chairman, Sir, I too got an earful. I\r\n\r\ngained  the  impression that the morale of the staff  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  is  low, as established norms of  employment  are\r\n\r\nturned  upside down.  I hesitate to give some of the comments\r\n\r\nI heard, but I thought that perhaps I should do so, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngive a depth of the emotion of the undercurrent that is going\r\n\r\non.   But  I  would  like  to disassociate  myself  from  any\r\n\r\ninnuendoes associated with them.  For instance, a  number  of\r\n\r\nstaff  reaching 50 years old were given short-term  2-3  year\r\n\r\ncontracts,  which  is very upsetting to the  staff  who  have\r\n\r\ncommitted their working life to the University.  On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  President has recruited advisers and  consultants\r\n\r\nfrom US universities, many of them 60 years old or above,  to\r\n\r\nadvise him on various development programmes.  It seems  that\r\n\r\nwe are forsaking younger staff for older staff.  Of course, I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  reform that impacts  established  norms  is\r\n\r\nalways unwelcome and discomforting to the incumbents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is disquiet on the NUS campus. The public is\r\n\r\nuncertain of what is going on.  I would like the Minister  to\r\n\r\nlift  this  veil  off  the reform in the University,  and  to\r\n\r\nelaborate on the goals and objectives of the reform currently\r\n\r\nbeing  implemented.   For  instance,  what  are  the  desired\r\n\r\noutcomes?   What is the progress to-date and  how  would  the\r\n\r\nproposed setup of another campus for the NUS tie in with  the\r\n\r\nproposed  plan of a fourth university that we earlier  talked\r\n\r\nabout?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>VISIT OF THE BRITISH PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Presence in Gallery)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Is it a model where we are going  to  have  many\r\n\r\nuniversities,  such  as the addition of a fourth  university,\r\n\r\nmaybe  a  fifth,  or  one where we are going  to  have  fewer\r\n\r\nuniversities,   such  as  the  existing   three,   but   then\r\n\r\nmushrooming multiple campuses?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I ask this is because previously, when we had\r\n\r\ndiscussion  on  the fourth university, Deputy Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nTony  Tan had made the point that Singapore should move  away\r\n\r\nfrom  the  model of one university suits all, and  we  should\r\n\r\ninstead  be encouraging the development of diversity  in  our\r\n\r\nuniversity  system, so that there is diversity  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ncurriculum, criteria for enrolment and generally in terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  cultural lifestyles of these universities.  So, I  would\r\n\r\nlike some clarification on that as to how we will proceed  as\r\n\r\nthe University system develops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A related question then is that for a university like\r\n\r\nNUS,  which  already  has a capacity of  about  15,000-16,000\r\n\r\nstudents, if I am not mistaken, is developing more campuses a\r\n\r\ndesirable  way  to go forward?  Or would it have  an  adverse\r\n\r\nimpact  on  its  standing  as  a  premier  research  academic\r\n\r\ninstitution in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final question is that of the fourth university\r\n\r\nwhich  had  been announced as something that was under  quite\r\n\r\nintense  study.  I want to know whether as a result  of  this\r\n\r\nannouncement by NUS, that plan has now been set back or it is\r\n\r\nproceeding apace.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, the idea of a fourth\r\n\r\nuniversity  was  first  mooted by the International  Academic\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Panel in January 2001.  The IAP had felt then  that\r\n\r\nthere was room for greater diversity in university education,\r\n\r\nwith a number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstitutions  each  having  its  own  niche  and   areas   of\r\n\r\nspecialisation.   The Panel thus supported the  establishment\r\n\r\nof  a fourth university which will be built upon the role  of\r\n\r\nthe  polytechnics.  Many Singaporeans, including  polytechnic\r\n\r\ngraduates,  will  then  have a shot at university  education.\r\n\r\nCurrently,   a  significant  seven  out  of  10   polytechnic\r\n\r\ngraduates  go  on to pursue degrees, many of  them  overseas.\r\n\r\nThis is a leakage that the local universities can plug.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February 2002, Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan had\r\n\r\nnoted  in  his  speech  at  the Graduation  Ceremony  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Chicago Graduate School of Business  that  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  to Review Upgrading Opportunities at Degree  Level\r\n\r\nhad  submitted a report to MOE recommending the establishment\r\n\r\nof  a  fourth university.  DPM Tony Tan had then said that  a\r\n\r\nfundamental review of the structure of the University had  to\r\n\r\nbe  undertaken  before a decision on the  proposed  structure\r\n\r\ncould be finalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, like many of my parliamentary colleagues\r\n\r\nalluded to, it was reported in the press (Straits Times, 30th\r\n\r\nApril  2002) that NUS will be setting up two new campuses  by\r\n\r\n2010,  in  response  to  the growing  demand  for  university\r\n\r\neducation  in  Singapore.  One of the two new campuses  would\r\n\r\ntake  3,000  undergraduates  into practice-based  engineering\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported that the potential target students for\r\n\r\nthis campus were polytechnic graduates who now go overseas to\r\n\r\nupgrade their qualifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister in the context of\r\n\r\nthe NUS' plans to go multi-campus, if there has been a change\r\n\r\nof  heart  regarding the establishment of a fourth university\r\n\r\nand, if so, the rationale for the change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Government's aim to increase\r\n\r\nSingaporeans' access to university education so that  one  in\r\n\r\nfour Singaporeans in each year's cohort,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstead of the current one in five, will have the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  attend  university in Singapore by 2010.  This is  timely\r\n\r\nand  indeed  crucial  in view of the  demands  for  a  better\r\n\r\neducated workforce.  It is also in line with our rallying cry\r\n\r\nto   allow  every  Singaporean  a  chance  to  maximise   his\r\n\r\npotential.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With both NUS' multi-campus plan and the establishment\r\n\r\nof  a fourth university, both would also help to achieve  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  objective of increasing the  university  cohort\r\n\r\nparticipation  rate.  But I feel that the  fourth  university\r\n\r\nroute  would  contribute more definitively to the development\r\n\r\nof a vibrant university sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed fourth university, as recommended by the\r\n\r\nCommittee to Review Upgrading Opportunities at Degree  Level,\r\n\r\nis to have a practical bent with industry links.  It is to be\r\n\r\na  major provider of continuing education and training and is\r\n\r\nto  cater to both part-time and full-time learning as well as\r\n\r\nadult  education.  The Committee had felt then  that  with  a\r\n\r\nfourth university, the higher education sector would be  more\r\n\r\nequipped  to cater to the varying needs of both industry  and\r\n\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully concur with these observations. I feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  introduction of a fourth university  would  better\r\n\r\nenrich   our  university  education  ecosystem.   The  fourth\r\n\r\nuniversity  with its own mission, structure  and  niche  will\r\n\r\ninject diversity into our university education landscape  and\r\n\r\nmore competition amongst the universities.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth university with the specific mission to focus\r\n\r\non  practice-oriented programmes and caters to the continuing\r\n\r\nprofessional development needs of working adults up to degree\r\n\r\nlevel  would help fill the gap that currently exists  in  our\r\n\r\nuniversity system, ie, giving a second chance to those who do\r\n\r\nnot  make  it to the local university system the  first  time\r\n\r\nround.  I feel that a fourth university that is given such  a\r\n\r\nclear  mandate  would be better able to tailor its  programme\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadmission  criteria to meet the needs of this group  than  an\r\n\r\nNUS  that  tries to be all things to all men with  a  diverse\r\n\r\nrange  of  objectives and goals that may be incongruent  with\r\n\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, I feel that a fourth university will be\r\n\r\nunencumbered by any baggage which the existing university may\r\n\r\ncarry.   For  instance, currently, only the  top  polytechnic\r\n\r\ngraduates in each cohort are able to gain admission into NUS,\r\n\r\nor  NTU, in view of the keen competition for a limited number\r\n\r\nof places.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Khor, could you please wind up your\r\n\r\nspeech?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Yes. So these applicants are\r\n\r\nrequired  not  only  to  have good academic  results  in  the\r\n\r\npolytechnic  but  also at \"O\" level and it clearly  does  not\r\n\r\ngive late bloomers a second chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore strongly urge the Ministry to study the\r\n\r\nmerits   of   establishing  a  fourth  university   to   meet\r\n\r\nSingaporeans' increasing demand for university education  and\r\n\r\nto  give  that second chance in life that they are  searching\r\n\r\nfor in the new social compact.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, there was a recent newspaper\r\n\r\narticle  in  the  Straits  Times  \"NTU  Grads:   Is  there  a\r\n\r\ndifference?\" dated 8th April which reported that there  is  a\r\n\r\ndifference between NUS and NTU graduates.  According  to  the\r\n\r\nreport,  local  companies surveyed found that  NUS  graduates\r\n\r\nwrite  and speak better, but NTU graduates are more creative.\r\n\r\nAre  these  true  or  are  they just perceptions?   The  more\r\n\r\ncritical  question is whether it is writing, speaking  skills\r\n\r\nor  creativity,  have our universities sufficiently  prepared\r\n\r\nour graduates for the new economy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than students, I share the concern of the other\r\n\r\nMembers, with the transformation of the university, what  has\r\n\r\nthe impact been on the academic staff?  Has the rapid changes\r\n\r\nin the universities, particularly the NUS, affected the staff\r\n\r\nmorale?  This is a critical issue because the morale  of  the\r\n\r\nstaff may affect the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third issue I want to raise here, which is my main\r\n\r\nconcern, is the role of the Chinese Studies Department of the\r\n\r\nNUS,  guo  da zhong wen xi.  Here, in Singapore, the  Chinese\r\n\r\nStudies  Department  plays a key role  in  nurturing  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage  teachers and journalists.  Would the Ministry  want\r\n\r\nthe   NUS   Chinese  Studies  Department  to  continue   this\r\n\r\ntraditional role in future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new broad-based education system to be implemented\r\n\r\nin  the NUS emphasises an all-rounded general education, that\r\n\r\nmeans,  undergraduates are encouraged to study a broad  range\r\n\r\nof  subjects  and  would learn about each subject  in  lesser\r\n\r\ndepth.  In this case, my worry is that undergraduates in  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Chinese Studies would  study  only  a  single\r\n\r\nChinese major plus other non-Chinese subjects.  This is a big\r\n\r\nchange  as  students  of the department  today  are  used  to\r\n\r\nstudying double majors, namely, Chinese Language (Hanyu)  and\r\n\r\nChinese  Studies (Hanxue), which would give them a reasonably\r\n\r\nall-rounded  exposure to Chinese language,  culture,  history\r\n\r\nand  philosophy.   Many people worry that, with  such  a  big\r\n\r\nshift,  graduates  of the future would be  sufficiently  less\r\n\r\nproficient  in  Chinese to be Chinese language  teachers  and\r\n\r\njournalists.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One practical suggestion is that there should be a\r\n\r\nscheme  for undergraduates who intend to be Chinese  Language\r\n\r\nprofessionals, such as teachers and journalists, etc,  to  be\r\n\r\nexempted  from  this  generalist approach  and  opt  for  the\r\n\r\npresent  system.   They  should be allowed  to  study  double\r\n\r\nmajors,  ie, Chinese Language and Chinese Studies (Hanyu  and\r\n\r\nHanxue)  like  the previous batches.  At the same  time,  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Studies Department should continue to offer  courses\r\n\r\nto others who would like to study it as a single subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Sir, the House was recently\r\n\r\ntold about the high amount of subsidy the Government provides\r\n\r\nfor  tertiary  education.  This is  rightly  so  knowing  how\r\n\r\nimportant our human resources are.  We need to do all we  can\r\n\r\nto ensure that those deserving of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntertiary education be given all the support necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, the Malay community also deeply\r\n\r\nappreciates the tertiary fee subsidy given to the Malays  who\r\n\r\nqualify for university and polytechnic education.  Those  who\r\n\r\nare  better off give up that subsidy for the benefit  of  the\r\n\r\nneedy  and  those  who  are more deserving.   But  those  who\r\n\r\nreceive  the Malay TFF subsidy will be required to give  back\r\n\r\nto  the community by doing social service.  This is the point\r\n\r\nwhich  I  would  like to raise about tertiary students  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the large subsidy given by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for tertiary education, our graduates  should  be\r\n\r\ntaught  to  pay back to society in one way or another.   Will\r\n\r\nMOE consider programmes to encourage and facilitate that?  At\r\n\r\nthe  North  East  CDC,  for example,  we  encourage  tertiary\r\n\r\nstudent  recipients of our programmes, for example, the  BUST\r\n\r\nsubsidy  programme to help in the community work.  They  help\r\n\r\nin our IT programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is how MOE could\r\n\r\nkeep  in touch with students who study overseas.  MOE  should\r\n\r\nwork  with the Singapore International Foundation and Contact\r\n\r\nSingapore for that purpose.  Sir, the Government has recently\r\n\r\ndecided  to  remove  the  tax rebate for  Singapore  students\r\n\r\nstudying overseas.  I think it is a pity as it could serve as\r\n\r\nan  indirect  bond for them.  I would like the Government  to\r\n\r\nplease  reconsider  withdrawing  that  rebate.   The  British\r\n\r\nCommissioner  is here, he knows that we have a  few  thousand\r\n\r\nstudents studying in UK, a few more thousands in the US and a\r\n\r\nfew  more  thousands in Australia.  But I  think  only  about\r\n\r\n5,000 benefit from that tax rebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not easy for parents to send their children to\r\n\r\nstudy  overseas.  Some go because they could not get a  place\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, others for courses not available here.  In any\r\n\r\ncase,  they are enhancing their worth and, thus, their future\r\n\r\ncontribution to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment having to spend more on subsidies for MOE.  I  was\r\n\r\nat  the memorial service at Ann Arbor where an undergraduate,\r\n\r\nthe  late  Miss Amanda Yeo, who was studying at the  Michigan\r\n\r\nUniversity died at a road accident.  She was the only girl of\r\n\r\nthe  family.  I met her family at the church service  in  Ann\r\n\r\nArbor  and I could feel the anguish and the tragedy  felt  by\r\n\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents whose children study overseas face all kinds of\r\n\r\nanxiety and uncertainty.  They deserve understanding.  I must\r\n\r\ndeclare  my  interest.  I am also a recipient and beneficiary\r\n\r\nof  that.   But  on  a larger picture, beyond  the  financial\r\n\r\nconsideration, beyond the tax rebate, we need to find ways to\r\n\r\nbond overseas students to Singapore.  I think MOE can help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, can MOE update the House on its thinking about\r\n\r\nthe honours course for Malay studies at the NUS?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, it was only about three years\r\n\r\nago  that the Ministry announced that the US-based Scholastic\r\n\r\nAptitude Test (SAT) would be used as an additional assessment\r\n\r\ntest  for  university entrance.  Presumably,  once  accepted,\r\n\r\nthis would become a substitute for the \"A\" level examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are problems with this approach. At this\r\n\r\npoint in time, the inclusion of SAT simply meant that our  JC\r\n\r\nstudents   have  to  prepare  for  two  university   entrance\r\n\r\nexaminations  in their final year of studies.   Interestingly\r\n\r\nenough,  none other than the respected UC President,  Richard\r\n\r\nAtkinson, has lambasted the SAT 1 test as being unsuitable as\r\n\r\na  university admission assessment test.  As a result, the US\r\n\r\nCollege  Board  announced  in March  this  year  that  it  is\r\n\r\nplanning   to  revise  its  SAT  1  to  better  service   its\r\n\r\nobjectives.   For  a test that the Americans themselves  have\r\n\r\ndeclared as not very suitable, we have to ask ourselves  what\r\n\r\nis  the value of us switching to SAT.  Of course, I am  aware\r\n\r\nthat  there is another part of SAT, known as SAT II, that  is\r\n\r\nmore vigorous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Addendum to the President's Address, the\r\n\r\nMinistry has declared its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nintention  of  taking  greater  control  of  the  \"A\"   level\r\n\r\nexaminations  in  year 2002.  It also  floated  the  idea  of\r\n\r\nsetting  up our very own Examinations Authority.   It  states\r\n\r\nthat  from year 2003 onwards, university admission will  take\r\n\r\ninto  account other measures, in addition to the \"A\"  levels.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  find out from the Ministry  whether  this\r\n\r\nannouncement meant that we have second thoughts about SAT.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage of development, Sir, I think we do not\r\n\r\nhave  to  depend any longer on the \"O\" level  and  \"A\"  level\r\n\r\nexaminations.   As  an  independent nation  with  outstanding\r\n\r\nscholastic  track  record, a well-funded R&D  sector  and  an\r\n\r\naspiration  to  become an education hub for the  Asia-Pacific\r\n\r\nregion, I strongly support the proposal to establish our  own\r\n\r\nExaminations  Authority.  However, we should be always  aware\r\n\r\nof  the  penchant of Singaporeans to crank up standards  year\r\n\r\nafter year.  In establishing our own Examinatiions Authority,\r\n\r\nwe should focus on developing a well educated individual with\r\n\r\nhigh  academic achievement, strong cultural ballast and sound\r\n\r\ncharacter.   We should avoid falling into the  trap  of  ever\r\n\r\nincreasing content to stress the students to the limit.  Sir,\r\n\r\nwould  the Minister share with this House on his thinking  on\r\n\r\nthe Examinations Authority?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nas  we embark on the new high-tech knowledge-based economy in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we require not only many graduates from  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions, we also need highly-skilled technical  officers\r\n\r\nso  that all these technologies could be applied smoothly  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE had, during our early days of nation building,\r\n\r\nplayed  a  major role in producing our skilled workforce.   A\r\n\r\ngreat   number  of  technicians  were  cultivated   for   our\r\n\r\nindustries, particularly the building industry. Now, with our\r\n\r\neconomy restructuring, we need a different type of skills for\r\n\r\nour  workers  and it is quite different from  those  that  we\r\n\r\ntrained  in  the old days.  Very often, during  my  meet-the-people sessions, I would meet residents who complained to  me\r\n\r\nthat  their  children  were sent to ITE  and  they  were  not\r\n\r\ncomfortable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout it.  They wanted their children to go to the mainstream\r\n\r\nschools.  To them, those who were sent to ITE were those  who\r\n\r\ncould  not make the grade to the mainstream schools. Given  a\r\n\r\nchoice,  they  would  want  their  children  to  go  to   the\r\n\r\nmainstream  schools, so that they could do their  \"O\"  level,\r\n\r\n\"A\"  level  and  then go to the university.  Because  in  the\r\n\r\nminds of the parents, going to the university is a sign and a\r\n\r\npromise of a good future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, when parents have overly high expectations\r\n\r\nfor  their  children, it could result in the  students  being\r\n\r\npressurised, and when they are sent to ITE, they will be very\r\n\r\ndemoralised,  and  lose  their  self-respect.  Many  of  them\r\n\r\nbelieve that   graduating from ITE may not land them a job. I\r\n\r\nam  very  glad to hear from the Minister, just now, that  the\r\n\r\nprospects  of ITE graduates were not too bad after  all.   We\r\n\r\nhave  read newspaper reports of some ITE graduates  who  have\r\n\r\ngained  admission to the polytechnic, and from there  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversity where they obtained their bachelor or even masters\r\n\r\ndegrees. Some went on to become successful entreprenuers.  It\r\n\r\nshows  that our ITEs are also capable of producing successful\r\n\r\nand useful citizens for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the problem lies with the fact that many\r\n\r\nparents do not understand what prospects their children  have\r\n\r\nwhen  they  go  to  ITE.   So I feel  that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  should give ITE a make-over. Like the Remaking  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, we should also have a Remaking of ITE.  We  should\r\n\r\nestablish its brand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I observe that students of ITE are still required\r\n\r\nto  wear  uniforms, like the school children from the  junior\r\n\r\nschools,  while the polytechnic and university undergraduates\r\n\r\nare  not  required to wear any uniform. This  makes  the  ITE\r\n\r\nstudents  feel  inferior.   Why can  we  not  allow  the  ITE\r\n\r\nstudents  to do away with their uniforms like the  university\r\n\r\nundergraduates?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if we want to instill more confidence in their\r\n\r\nparents, we should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenhance  the status of ITE. Our universities have  linked  up\r\n\r\nwith  other  renowned foreign universities to  become  sister\r\n\r\nuniversities.   Why can we not encourage ITE to tie  up  with\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  well-known colleges overseas  to  enhance  its\r\n\r\nreputation?   Here I am not saying that the moon overseas  is\r\n\r\nbrighter than the one in Singapore.  But I am saying that the\r\n\r\nSingapore  moon  is just as round as the moon  in  the  other\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I hope, Sir, that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation  would make efforts to \"remake ITE\" while  remaking\r\n\r\nSingapore,  so  that the students of ITE will  be   proud  of\r\n\r\nthemselves.   As a matter of fact, many parents felt  ashamed\r\n\r\nwhen  their  children were sent to ITE. When asked  by  their\r\n\r\nfriends where their children were studying, they would  reply\r\n\r\nshamefully,  \"Oh, some neighbourhood school.  I do  not  know\r\n\r\nits name.\"  Why is it that we make these parents harbour such\r\n\r\ninferiority complex?  Why can we not do something  about  it?\r\n\r\nRaise  the status of ITE, tell the parents that the  moon  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  just as round as in the other countries,  that\r\n\r\nour  ITE  in  Singapore  is just as  good  as  the  technical\r\n\r\ncolleges overseas.  I know the Minister for Education is very\r\n\r\nmodest,  but  I  think sometimes he can  afford  to  be  more\r\n\r\narrogant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Sir, I am not sure if we should thank\r\n\r\nMr  Jack  Neo for thrusting ITE into the limelight  with  the\r\n\r\nfilm I Not Stupid because \"it not good\"!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ITE plays a crucial role in providing the much-needed skills training, as well as continuous training. One\r\n\r\ngood  thing  about the recession is that it reminds  us  that\r\n\r\nskills training is an integral part of our economic survival.\r\n\r\nAs  Singapore  restructures our economy,  there  is  an  even\r\n\r\ngreater need to increase the pool of skilled workers.   Those\r\n\r\nwho  do not possess relevant skills will find it increasingly\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  keep their jobs or find new jobs  in  time  to\r\n\r\ncome.   The ITE produces more than 10,000 graduates  a  year,\r\n\r\nand many of them have done well.  In fact, more than 1,400 of\r\n\r\nthem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthereafter.  This shows that ITE indeed is not the end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I feel compelled to remind ourselves that the\r\n\r\nsuccess  and  the contribution of ITE should not be  measured\r\n\r\nonly by the number of graduates who proceeded to polytechnics\r\n\r\nor  universities.  We need to redefine success and, to do so,\r\n\r\nwe  must  first recognise that ITE provides a wide  scope  of\r\n\r\ncurriculum, ranging from cutting-edge information  technology\r\n\r\nto biomedical technology.  ITE graduates are professionals in\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  fields,  and  they  can  excel  and   make\r\n\r\npositive, even critical, contributions to the economy and the\r\n\r\nsociety,  even if they do not proceed to the polytechnics  or\r\n\r\nuniversities eventually.  Without them, we will not  be  able\r\n\r\nto attract good investments to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister said earlier that even in the year 2001,\r\n\r\nwhen the recession was at its worst, 88% of the ITE graduates\r\n\r\nwere  able to secure a full-time job within three months  and\r\n\r\ntheir  average salary ranged between $1,100 and  $1,400,  not\r\n\r\nbad  in  a recession year.  We have also heard stories  about\r\n\r\nITE   graduates  being  successful  in  business.   ITE  has,\r\n\r\nundoubtedly,  done  a  good  job.   Its  graduates  are  well\r\n\r\nregarded  by their employers.  Unfortunately, Sir, the  image\r\n\r\nof  ITE  has been somewhat less than what it deserves, partly\r\n\r\ndue  to  its association with its predecessor, the VITB,  and\r\n\r\npartly due to the show I Not Stupid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether he would\r\n\r\nconsider putting in more resources into ITE to further expand\r\n\r\nand  upgrade  its programmes, as well as to have a  proactive\r\n\r\nprogramme to improve its profile and image.  I note that  the\r\n\r\nrecurrent  budget for ITE has been reduced by 2.6% while  the\r\n\r\nrecurrent  budget for the overall Ministry of  Education  has\r\n\r\nincreased by 1.5%.  I hope that we are not sending the  wrong\r\n\r\nmessage.  However, I note that the capital expenditure budget\r\n\r\nfor the ITE has increased substantially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister would also consider encouraging\r\n\r\nthe ITE to have academic exchange programmes with reputable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsimilar   nature.   This  will  undoubtedly  inject   greater\r\n\r\nprofessionalism  into  ITE.  It  will  also  help  raise  the\r\n\r\ninternational standing of ITE and boost its image.  Then,  we\r\n\r\ncan  change the image of ITE and it is no longer the end  but\r\n\r\nto change it to the Institute of Technical Excellence.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Institute  of  Technical Education in  our  country  has\r\n\r\nplayed  an  important  role  and will  continue  to  play  an\r\n\r\nimportant role in training our technicians and engineers  for\r\n\r\nthe  future, our industry and the new economy.  In our effort\r\n\r\nto   remake  Singapore,  we  should  study  skills  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogrammes,   retraining  and  lifelong  learning   for   our\r\n\r\nworkforce.    The   ITE  and  polytechnics   will   play   an\r\n\r\nincreasingly  important  role  in  this  matter.   The   main\r\n\r\nchallenge  for  the ITE and polytechnics is  to  attract  and\r\n\r\nencourage our workers to return to school or the classroom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we often hear stories of outstanding ITE and\r\n\r\npolytechnic graduates who become successful entrepreneurs and\r\n\r\nbusinessmen.   They bring pride to the ITE and  polytechnics,\r\n\r\nand  I feel more will achieve success.  They make a name  for\r\n\r\nthemselves, thus bringing prestige to the institutions of ITE\r\n\r\nand  the  polytechnics through their success.  Through  their\r\n\r\nsuccess, we will better appreciate the good efforts of  these\r\n\r\ninstitutions  that have prepared and equipped  them  for  the\r\n\r\nemployment  market and the industrial world  which  are  very\r\n\r\nchallenging and competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ITE is one of the pillars of our education system.\r\n\r\nBoth  the ITE and polytechnic system emphasise excellence  in\r\n\r\ntechnical  education.   Year after year,  these  institutions\r\n\r\nhave    undergone   numerous   renewals.    Therefore,    job\r\n\r\nopportunities for ITE and polytechnic graduates are good, and\r\n\r\nSingapore  offers  many opportunities for those  who  undergo\r\n\r\ntechnical  education.   We will see more  new  jobs  and  new\r\n\r\npotential   in   the   knowledge-based  economy.    ITE   and\r\n\r\npolytechnic  graduates will find that they have a  place  for\r\n\r\nthemselves\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many areas in which the ITE and\r\n\r\npolytechnics can explore.  The services industry has a  large\r\n\r\npotential  for them.  Our nation is expanding the information\r\n\r\ntechnology, life sciences and chemical industries.  These are\r\n\r\nareas  which  need a skilled workforce, and the ITE  and  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics  could think of ways to support  these  thriving\r\n\r\nindustries.  Like other educational institutions, ITE and the\r\n\r\npolytechnics  should  encourage  creativity  and  innovation.\r\n\r\nTheir students should be given the freedom to explore and  go\r\n\r\ndeeper  into  their  studies.  Practical skills  and  certain\r\n\r\nskills  are  important, but they cannot ensure our  survival.\r\n\r\nWe should nurture our students with an entrepreneurial spirit\r\n\r\nand  a \"dare to fail\" attitude so that they would work harder\r\n\r\nand face new challenges with success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of technical education is high, and we are\r\n\r\nrespected  in  many countries in the world.  There  are  many\r\n\r\nexamples  where  ITE graduates are successful  in  continuing\r\n\r\ntheir  education  to  the university and  polytechnic.   This\r\n\r\nshows  that the ITE has built a strong foundation and  should\r\n\r\nbe  seen  as  a  good beginning for our students.   Technical\r\n\r\ntraining and the ability to \"adapt oneself\" for the  ITE  and\r\n\r\npolytechnic  graduates  are seen as two  positive  traits  to\r\n\r\nnurture  those  who  are technopreneurs.   But  ITE  and  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics  can  do  more by offering  additional  business\r\n\r\nmodules and giving support to the potential graduates through\r\n\r\nan  incubation  system  and network of graduates.   Technical\r\n\r\neducation  in  our  country has come  a  long  way  and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to expand.  With new changes in the structure of ITE\r\n\r\nand  polytechnics and also continuous upgrading of the  staff\r\n\r\nand  their  facilities, these institutions will  continue  to\r\n\r\nexcel.   Our  polytechnics have trained many people  in  this\r\n\r\nregion.  They appreciate our assistance and have praised  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  the  courses that we offer.  Our  neighbours  in\r\n\r\nASEAN have also benefitted.  From one angle, we grapple  with\r\n\r\nthe  effort to continue improving our products and  services,\r\n\r\nbut  here we already have a good product, ie, the quality  of\r\n\r\nour education and training.  Outsiders see these as our brand\r\n\r\nname, but we have not reaped its full benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy  do we not market our educational services industry  more\r\n\r\naggressively?  Sir, I propose that our main institutions  can\r\n\r\nlead  in  this effort.  We should not have the old  thinking,\r\n\r\nie,  \"Why  should we help others to catch up or compete  with\r\n\r\nus?\"  This is wrong because, if we do not improve on whatever\r\n\r\nwe  have,  others will take over our place.  Let us  increase\r\n\r\nour effort to market our courses and services.  Singapore can\r\n\r\nbecome  the  leading  education centre  in  this  region.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  we  can  expand our services beyond the  borders  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Sir, we have a strong and diverse\r\n\r\npost-secondary  sector  that caters  to  different  types  of\r\n\r\nstudents.   Our  ITE,  polytechnics  and  universities  offer\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  access  to an array of academic  and  technical\r\n\r\noptions in further education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to thank Mr Ong, Mr Gan and Mr\r\n\r\nZainudin for the encouragement that they have given  to  ITE.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to try and market ITE as well as we can.  In\r\n\r\nfact, I would invite all Members of this House to come along,\r\n\r\nand  I hope that they will come, including Mr Inderjit Singh,\r\n\r\nto see for themselves how well the students are doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE has come a long way. It is now a confident,\r\n\r\nincreasingly    well-regarded   post-secondary    educational\r\n\r\ninstitution.   The  real success of ITE is  not  measured  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  how  many  students  have  been  able  to  go   to\r\n\r\npolytechnic  or how many students have gone on to  university\r\n\r\nfrom   ITE,  although  we  celebrate  the  success  of  these\r\n\r\nstudents.  The real success of ITE has been the fact that  it\r\n\r\nhas  successfully  raised  the prospects  and  maximised  the\r\n\r\npotential  of  young  Singaporeans who,  in  other  education\r\n\r\nsystems all over the world, would have been left behind.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that youth unemployment in Singapore is not a  problem,\r\n\r\neven  in  the  middle of the recession, is  evidence  of  the\r\n\r\nsuccess of ITE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a robust polytechnic sector which provides vital\r\n\r\ntechnical and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupervisory  manpower,  and many  of  our  entrepreneurs  and\r\n\r\nbusiness leaders today come from the polytechnics.   We  have\r\n\r\nthree  good  universities,  each  with  their  different  and\r\n\r\ndistinct   focus   and   character.    Different   types   of\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  each  with different  missions  and  different\r\n\r\nemphasis, together, they provide a range of options  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe needs of both the economy and individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward, we intend to expand opportunities and\r\n\r\nintroduce greater diversity in the further education  sector.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to  increase capacity so that  all  those  able  to\r\n\r\nbenefit  from  further  education  can  have  access  to  our\r\n\r\ntechnical institutes, polytechnics and universities.  We have\r\n\r\nsignificantly expanded opportunities across all types of post-secondary  and  tertiary education.  Twenty years  ago,  less\r\n\r\nthan  three  out  of  10  pupils made  it  to  post-secondary\r\n\r\neducation.  Ten years ago, it had grown to nearly six out  of\r\n\r\n10.   Today, more than eight out of 10 do so.  At the  degree\r\n\r\nlevel,  the Ministry is considering further expansion of  the\r\n\r\nuniversity sector.  Our university cohort participation  rate\r\n\r\nhas  quadrupled  from  5% in 1980 to  21%  today.   With  the\r\n\r\nsounder  foundation that our students now receive in  school,\r\n\r\nthe  university cohort participation rate can be raised  from\r\n\r\nthe  current 21% to 25%, and we are now working to make  this\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater capacity is also necessary to provide for the\r\n\r\nlarger  cohorts  of  students feeding through  to  the  post-secondary  sector.  As Members know, 1988 was a dragon  year,\r\n\r\nwith  a  bumper  crop  of 53,000 babies.   In  the  10  years\r\n\r\nfollowing  that,  the number of babies born averaged  49,000,\r\n\r\nabout 20% higher than the decade before 1988.  These children\r\n\r\nstarted to come into the school system in 1995.  In 2005, the\r\n\r\ndragon  babies  will be ready to enter ITE, the  polytechnics\r\n\r\nand  pre-university.  We have anticipated this, and  we  will\r\n\r\nhave sufficient places for them.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve greater diversity and expand opportunities in\r\n\r\nthe  sector,  the  Ministry is currently  restructuring  ITE,\r\n\r\nbuilding  a  fifth polytechnic and reviewing  the  university\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE will regroup its current 10 campuses into three\r\n\r\nRegional  Campuses (RCs) over the next 15 years.  The  larger\r\n\r\ncampuses  will  allow each campus to offer a  full  range  of\r\n\r\ncourses  and provide the opportunities for cross-disciplinary\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$700 million will be spent to build a fifth polytechnic\r\n\r\nwhich  will  open its door in 2003.  The Republic Polytechnic\r\n\r\nwill  not  only  increase capacity, it  will  inject  greater\r\n\r\ndiversity into this important sector of our education system,\r\n\r\nand help to further raise standards all round.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Inter-ministerial Committee, chaired by Dr Ng, is\r\n\r\ncurrently  reviewing the university sector.  He  will  update\r\n\r\nMembers on this later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with specific issues on our public\r\n\r\nuniversities brought up by Dr Wang and Mr Yeo.  I would first\r\n\r\nlike  to thank Mr Yeo for pointing out that NUS and NTU  have\r\n\r\nachieved  a  degree of international standing for themselves.\r\n\r\nBoth  NUS  and NTU aim for excellence in education,  research\r\n\r\nand contribution to the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo expressed concern on the impact of curricular\r\n\r\nbroadening on the Department of Chinese Studies.  I have been\r\n\r\ntold  by NUS that the emphasis on broad-based education  does\r\n\r\nnot  preclude  students from gaining a rigorous grounding  in\r\n\r\nChinese  Literature, Chinese Language, history or philosophy.\r\n\r\nStudents  can  still  opt  to read modules  in  both  Chinese\r\n\r\nStudies and Chinese Language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, a university will only flourish if they have\r\n\r\ncapable  and committed staff of high quality.  Both  NUS  and\r\n\r\nNTU  have  put  in  place  a market-driven  performance-based\r\n\r\nrenumeration  system  that  gives them  more  flexibility  to\r\n\r\nreward excellence and to attract and retain talent.  Dr  Wang\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Yeo have expressed some concern about the impact  of\r\n\r\nthese  changes  on staff.  Sir, both universities  are  going\r\n\r\nthrough  a period of transition from basically teaching-based\r\n\r\ninstitutions  to  institutions that place  emphasis  on  both\r\n\r\nteaching  and  research.  Some staff may  adapt  faster  than\r\n\r\nothers.  However, I am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfident that these changes are necessary for the success of\r\n\r\nthe  universities in the long-term.  Dr Wang  said  that  the\r\n\r\nstaff attrition rate of NUS is high.  Last year, 5.9% of NUS'\r\n\r\nfaculty  members  or 116 left the university.   This  is  not\r\n\r\nunreasonable, especially compared to the attrition  rates  of\r\n\r\nreputable universities worldwide, where the attrition rate of\r\n\r\n10%,  12%  or  15%  is not uncommon.  NUS has  been  able  to\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  recruit new faculty members.   Last  year,  NUS\r\n\r\nrecruited 194 new faculty members. Too high a turnover  rate,\r\n\r\nof  course, is undesirable.  But a certain level of  turnover\r\n\r\nis  healthy,  if any organisation is to renew and  regenerate\r\n\r\nitself.    This   turnover   of  faculty   in   NUS   creates\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  intellectual  renewal  and  ensures  high\r\n\r\nacademic standards, which is key to NUS' goal of being world-class.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our educational institutions must recruit the people\r\n\r\nstrictly based on merit, and if Dr Wang has any evidence that\r\n\r\nthis has not been so in any of our institutions, I would urge\r\n\r\nhim to immediately make this known to my Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang spoke about universities switching to SAT. I\r\n\r\nwould  like to clarify that my Ministry has never  said  that\r\n\r\nSAT will replace the \"A\" levels.  SAT I is only one component\r\n\r\nof  the University Admission System and serves as a reasoning\r\n\r\ntest that complements a content-based \"A\" level examinations.\r\n\r\nHaving a basket of admission requirements provides for a more\r\n\r\nholistic measure of an applicant's ability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAT II tests that Dr Wang mentioned are tests that\r\n\r\nmeasure  specific content-based knowledge and would duplicate\r\n\r\nthe  function already served by the \"A\" levels.   Hence,  MOE\r\n\r\nhas  no  intention to introduce SAT II.  We will  study  what\r\n\r\nchanges  the College Board intends to make to SAT I, and  see\r\n\r\nif  it  continues to be a test that suits our  purpose.   The\r\n\r\nestablishment  of an examination board does not  reflect  any\r\n\r\nsecond thoughts about SAT I.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of establishing an examination board is to\r\n\r\nbuild up our own capability and expertise in educational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassessment and examination services.  As Dr Wang pointed out,\r\n\r\nit  will  support  our  efforts to develop  Singapore  as  an\r\n\r\neducational  hub.   The examination board  will  conduct  the\r\n\r\nnational  examinations  based on  the  Ministry's  prescribed\r\n\r\nsyllabuses  and curriculum framework, and the Ministry  would\r\n\r\nensure   that  the  examinations  accurately  assess  pupils'\r\n\r\nachievement validly and reliably and are closely  aligned  to\r\n\r\ncurricular objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, examinations, testing and assessments are an\r\n\r\nintegral  part of the education process. They should  not  be\r\n\r\nseen as something separate.  They provide feedback and ensure\r\n\r\nthat  standards  are  maintained.  Examinations  only  become\r\n\r\ndysfunctional if they are not aligned with the objectives  of\r\n\r\neducation.  If they measure things which are not really  what\r\n\r\nyour  objectives are in education, it thereby leads  students\r\n\r\ndown a path which is not what you really want them to do.  To\r\n\r\nreflect  our focus on creativity and thinking, we  have  been\r\n\r\nmodifying  our  examination  formats  to  include  open  book\r\n\r\nexaminations,  source-based  questions  where  students   are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  draw inferences, project work, and school-based\r\n\r\ncontinuous  assessment  of  the  practical  and  experimental\r\n\r\ncapability of our \"A\" level Science students. These are quite\r\n\r\ndifferent  from the traditional examinations and tests  which\r\n\r\nstudents  have taken in the past.  Of course, they  are  more\r\n\r\nchallenging  for  both the students and teachers  to  prepare\r\n\r\nfor.   Such assessments are more aligned with our educational\r\n\r\ngoals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our own examination board, we will be more able to\r\n\r\nensure   that   examinations  are   well-aligned   with   our\r\n\r\nobjectives, and that we can introduce innovations, such as IT-based  assessments, without having to wait  till  others  are\r\n\r\nready.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now ask Dr Ng to respond to the other points that\r\n\r\nMembers have raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman, the Minister has sketched an overview of our  post-secondary education sector.  I would like\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  address specific queries from some Members.  Let me touch\r\n\r\non ITE and the polytechnic first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry wholeheartedly agrees with Mr Ong, Mr Gan\r\n\r\nand  Mr  Zainudin Nordin that the polytechnic and ITE sectors\r\n\r\nare  important pillars of our education system.  I would like\r\n\r\nto assure Members that the Government will continue to invest\r\n\r\nin  technical  education.  For  FY2002,  the  Government  has\r\n\r\nbudgeted  $1.2  billion which translates to  an  increase  of\r\n\r\nabout 25% over FY2001's provision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed FY2002 budget may give some Members,\r\n\r\nincluding  Mr  Gan,  the impression that  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nspending  less.   This  is because in FY2001,  the  operating\r\n\r\nbudget included a one-off payment for the outstanding GST  on\r\n\r\nthe  polytechnics  and ITE for prior years.   Excluding  this\r\n\r\nitem,  Government's  spending  for  the  technical  education\r\n\r\nsector is actually significantly higher for FY2002.  A  fifth\r\n\r\npolytechnic  will be developed and we will be  spending  more\r\n\r\nthan $350 million in developmental costs to build ITE's first\r\n\r\nRegional  Campus  at Simei.  The construction  of  the  first\r\n\r\nRegional Campus will begin in the second half of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mr Gan Kim\r\n\r\nYong  agree  with  the  Ministry that  ITE  is  an  excellent\r\n\r\ninstitution. They feel that the ITE has been wrongly maligned\r\n\r\nand  asked if we can do more to improve the public perception\r\n\r\nof  ITE.   I agree that ITE has been unfairly misrepresented.\r\n\r\nMOE  is  extremely  proud of what ITE has  accomplished.   We\r\n\r\nconsistently \"show off\" ITE to overseas guests  who  go  away\r\n\r\nwith  great  admiration and commend us for  doing  it  right.\r\n\r\nWhat  they mean is that we have resisted, in the words of  Dr\r\n\r\nAmy  Khor,  trying to be \"all things to all  men\".   We  have\r\n\r\nfocused  on substance, rather than form.  We have  done  this\r\n\r\nbecause  we assess correctly the abilities of that sector  of\r\n\r\nthe  students, given them relevant value-added education  and\r\n\r\nthereby help them find jobs and retain their dignity.  Mr Ong\r\n\r\nAh  Heng can tell the parent, who was worried about her child\r\n\r\nwho went to ITE, that not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly is the moon very round, it is like a moon cake, you  can\r\n\r\ntaste  the substance, with the yolk. The Minister has already\r\n\r\nreported that 88% of our ITE graduates find employment within\r\n\r\nthree  months of graduation.  This is not not bad.   This  is\r\n\r\nvery  good.  Hong Kong recently reported an unemployment rate\r\n\r\nof 14% for those aged 25 years and below, first time entering\r\n\r\nthe  job  market.  Many of these students  went  through  the\r\n\r\neducation  system, but failed in so many subjects  that  they\r\n\r\nachieve neither substance nor form.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we get international praise for ITE whilst some\r\n\r\nlocals  perceive ITE negatively?  Singaporeans will  have  to\r\n\r\nexamine  themselves  to  determine if  they  are  making  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  value judgement.  We will be proud, as  my  Minister\r\n\r\nsays, to take them on a tour around ITE to help them make  up\r\n\r\ntheir  minds.   But  my ITE board, principals,  teachers  and\r\n\r\nstudents know full well my highest regard for them and  their\r\n\r\ninstitution.   More importantly, the teachers  are  proud  to\r\n\r\nteach  in ITE - they have a very low turnover rate.   If  the\r\n\r\ninstitution  is bad, explain to me why the turnover  rate  is\r\n\r\nonly  4%?   They  are  proud despite the derision  from  some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  many  of whom have never  visited  ITE.  These\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, by their unfair remarks, diminish the good work\r\n\r\nof  committed  teachers and the significant  achievements  of\r\n\r\nstudents in ITE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, the majority of the public is more\r\n\r\ndiscerning  and  this  has  been  helped  by  ITE's  outreach\r\n\r\nprogramme.  ITE indeed reaches out to 14,000 students in  the\r\n\r\nNormal  Stream and 1,800 parents annually.  Special  outreach\r\n\r\nprogrammes  are also conducted for existing secondary  school\r\n\r\nteachers  and principals and the graduating trainee  teachers\r\n\r\nat  NIE,  as  they are significant groups of people  who  can\r\n\r\nadvise students on their post-secondary educational choices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to report that ITE's image has improved\r\n\r\nsignificantly  in recent years.  In an ITE public  perception\r\n\r\nsurvey  conducted in 1997, many Singaporeans felt  that  \"ITE\r\n\r\nwas  good but not for me\".  However, in the 2000 survey, many\r\n\r\npeople are now accepting that ITE does indeed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprovide  an alternative and viable educational pathway  which\r\n\r\nmeets  their career and academic aspirations.  What  is  more\r\n\r\nencouraging  is that 37% of respondents put  ITE  as  one  of\r\n\r\ntheir top three choices for post-secondary education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the polytechnic sector. Mr Zainudin\r\n\r\nNordin has asked if we should leverage on our reputation  and\r\n\r\nstrength to market services and products in quality technical\r\n\r\neducation.   Our  institutions have already done  that  to  a\r\n\r\nlimited  extent.  I must, however, emphasise  that  marketing\r\n\r\nservice   overseas  is  not  the  primary  mission   of   our\r\n\r\npolytechnics  and  ITE.   Our  polytechnics  and  ITE  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  focus  on  providing  accessible  and   quality\r\n\r\ntechnical education to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now speak about the university sector. I\r\n\r\nthank  Dr Wang, Mr Iswaran and Dr Amy Khor for their interest\r\n\r\nin the Government's approach to expanding the capacity of the\r\n\r\nuniversity sector.  Both at the Inter-Ministry Committee  and\r\n\r\nthe  ERC,  we  are  fundamentally reviewing  what  roles  the\r\n\r\nuniversities need to perform to continue to play an  integral\r\n\r\npart  in supporting our economic initiatives.  This would  be\r\n\r\nan  opportune  time  to  surface strategic  issues  regarding\r\n\r\nuniversity education in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For brevity, I will simplify things by stating that the\r\n\r\nuniversities play three roles for Singaporeans. Firstly, they\r\n\r\nfulfil aspirations for those who want degrees. Secondly, they\r\n\r\ntrain  and  produce  graduates  to  support  our  industries.\r\n\r\nThirdly, they are incubators and \"hatching grounds\" for ideas\r\n\r\nthat will lead and shape industry.  We would have started  on\r\n\r\na  very  wrong footing if we approached the review mainly  to\r\n\r\nfulfill aspirations - as Dr Amy Khor suggested, to give  some\r\n\r\npeople  a  second chance - of just deciding how to create  an\r\n\r\nadditional  3,000  more  university  places  each   year   to\r\n\r\naccommodate  25% of our cohort of students.   Governments  in\r\n\r\nsome   European  countries  funded  the  expansion  of  their\r\n\r\nuniversities to cater to an ever-increasing pressure to allow\r\n\r\nmore and more citizens to enter universities - and with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiminishing returns. The idea is noble, well-intentioned  but\r\n\r\nillusory:   whoever seeks to be educated in  whatever  course\r\n\r\nshall  be  admitted.   If  the citizen  is  enriched  through\r\n\r\neducation,  even  if  he does not have the  academic  ability\r\n\r\nrequired, then society is still enhanced.  What happens?  30-50%  of  the  first  year  cohort drop  out;  professors  and\r\n\r\nlecturers  become  disheartened  and  demoralised.  Standards\r\n\r\ndrop,  and the diminishing cycle perpetuates.  Consider this.\r\n\r\nDespite   50%  of  the  cohort  in  some  European  countries\r\n\r\nattending university, Europe is short of engineers  (as  told\r\n\r\nto  me  by Spanish, Danish industrialists and the UK Sterling\r\n\r\nGroup  of  Professors)!  So, too the United States.   Let  me\r\n\r\nquote   to  you  what  the  Dean  of  Engineering  at  Tuft's\r\n\r\nUniversity at Boston testified at the Capitol Hill last week.\r\n\r\nHe  said, \"We have a severe shortage of engineers. We  import\r\n\r\nengineers from abroad and a lot of our new technologies  that\r\n\r\nwe rely on for security reasons are developed abroad.  And  I\r\n\r\ndon't think that's a safe path\".  Despite a dramatic increase\r\n\r\nin  the country's demand for engineers, interest in the field\r\n\r\nhas   dropped  significantly  at  colleges  and  universities\r\n\r\nnationwide.   So this leading academician is now  asking  for\r\n\r\nmore  funds  to reverse this trend.  Even if he gets  it,  it\r\n\r\nwill take some years for them to catch up.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been more prudent and only funded students\r\n\r\nof  sufficient calibre to enter our public universities  and,\r\n\r\nmore  so,  in  particular  disciplines  of  engineering   and\r\n\r\nsciences that would help our overall economy.  That policy of\r\n\r\nproducing graduates relevant to industry enabled us  to  ride\r\n\r\non  globalisation and manufacturing in the last  two  decades\r\n\r\nand  the economy thrived.  This policy will continue but will\r\n\r\nnot  be enough to secure our future prosperity as we move  up\r\n\r\nthe value chain in a knowledge-intensive economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China has a birth cohort of 24 million per year.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  they  produce  1.6 million  graduates,  and  that\r\n\r\nnumber will grow.  In comparison, Singapore produces\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10,000 graduates each year from our public universities.   We\r\n\r\ncannot compete on size or the average of our graduates alone.\r\n\r\nThe  \"peaks\", in other words, the highs that our universities\r\n\r\nand  their  graduates  attain, must  be  our  differentiating\r\n\r\nfactor.  Our universities must now move further up the  value\r\n\r\nchain  and  have  people  who can create  new  knowledge  and\r\n\r\ninnovate.  They must be able to effectively transfer this new\r\n\r\nknowledge  into  the business and industry,  so  that  wealth\r\n\r\ncreation will ensue.  This is not something that we want  but\r\n\r\nneed to have for our economy to grow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The precious material in a knowledge-based economy is\r\n\r\nbrain power, and investments will flow to wherever there is a\r\n\r\nconcentration  of this.  The Research Triangle  Park  in  the\r\n\r\nstate of North Carolina, where Deputy Prime Minister Tan  and\r\n\r\nI visited recently, clearly exemplifies that universities can\r\n\r\ncreate  wealth for the country.  The state of North  Carolina\r\n\r\nhas  about  eight million people.  Forty years ago,  its  per\r\n\r\ncapita  income was the second lowest in the USA,  only  above\r\n\r\nthe  state of Mississippi.  They were very much dependent  on\r\n\r\ntobacco,   textiles   and   agricultural   industries    with\r\n\r\ndiminishing profits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leaders from business, academia and industry, with\r\n\r\nthe  help from legislators, decided to start a research  park\r\n\r\nbased on their three leading universities - the University of\r\n\r\nNorth  Carolina  at  Chapel Hill, the  North  Carolina  State\r\n\r\nUniversity  at  Raleigh  and  the  private  Duke  University.\r\n\r\nToday,  the  Research Triangle Park has achieved  the  wealth\r\n\r\ncreation  effect.   Gross  revenue generated  last  year  was\r\n\r\nUS$6.5   billion  and  the  park  provides  work  for  44,000\r\n\r\nresidents.  The average incomes of the state have risen to be\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  the average income earned  in  the  USA,  and\r\n\r\nworkers  within  the park earn 120% of the median  income  of\r\n\r\nworkers  within  the  USA.   The  average  salary  is   about\r\n\r\nUS$55,000 a year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story of brains attracting investments is repeated\r\n\r\nacross  the  USA  and, indeed, much of  the  world,  eg,  the\r\n\r\nOresund Region based in Sweden and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDenmark.  Some are planned more than others, but the elements\r\n\r\nof   success   are   the  same.   Multi-national   industrial\r\n\r\ncorporations  are moving away from their central laboratories\r\n\r\nto  congregations of brains to mine for ideas.  This  creates\r\n\r\nwealth and it is a virtuous cycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are cogent lessons to be learnt. The first is\r\n\r\nthat  our universities must become engines of growth for  our\r\n\r\neconomy,  not  only  just produce graduates  to  support  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   All our public universities must find their  niche\r\n\r\nin creating wealth.  How can we help them do this?  We can do\r\n\r\nso by matching capabilities with resources; allowing students\r\n\r\nand,  indeed, faculties to move at the desired pace.  We must\r\n\r\ncreate   a   robust  eco-system  incorporating   our   public\r\n\r\nuniversities, ie, NUS, NTU and SMU, research institutions and\r\n\r\neven  private  universities.  We must allow  each  university\r\n\r\nand,   indeed,  each  faculty  or  discipline   within   that\r\n\r\nuniversity,  to differentiate itself and find  its  niche  in\r\n\r\nthis economic imperative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25% of our students will go to university by 2010. They\r\n\r\nwill  have  differing capabilities and  strengths.   I  agree\r\n\r\nabsolutely with Dr Amy Khor that the university cannot try to\r\n\r\nbe 'all things to all men'.  Our universities must respond to\r\n\r\nthat diversity, take ownership of their students, faculty and\r\n\r\ninstitutions, and understand their mission accordingly.   Not\r\n\r\nall can or will want to do research.  Some would prefer to be\r\n\r\nmore  industrially-oriented.  So it is not only about setting\r\n\r\nup a fourth or even a fifth university, as Dr Amy Khor and Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran enquired, but about establishing a university  system\r\n\r\nthat can fulfill our desired goals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not come to a conclusion, but the multi-campus\r\n\r\nmodel for NUS appears attractive for a number of reasons.  By\r\n\r\nintroducing  a multi-campus structure, we can  build  on  the\r\n\r\nstrengths  of  our  existing universities and  still  promote\r\n\r\ndiversity.  We can allow each campus to develop strengths  in\r\n\r\ndifferent disciplines.  For example, the University of  North\r\n\r\nCarolina  (UNC)  system is a state university  comprising  16\r\n\r\ncampuses.   The UNC at Chapel Hill is a centre of  excellence\r\n\r\nin liberal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narts  and  professional disciplines, while the North Carolina\r\n\r\nState  University has a strong engineering  school,  with  an\r\n\r\nemphasis on industrial engagement and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the scenario of a multi-campus NUS, we can\r\n\r\nimagine  the  campus  at  Kent Ridge focusing  more  on  R&D,\r\n\r\ntogether  with research institutions in engineering, medicine\r\n\r\nand  the  sciences.   NUS at Outram could  house  a  graduate\r\n\r\nmedical  school  and  expand  into  biomedical  sciences  and\r\n\r\nnursing.    NUS  (X)  would  excel  in  industrially-oriented\r\n\r\nengineering  and  info-communications technology.   We  could\r\n\r\nalso   create   a  creative  cluster  within   NUS   (X)   by\r\n\r\nincorporating the Arts Faculty, Architecture and a School  of\r\n\r\nDesign,  Media and Visual Arts.  Mr Iswaran asked  if  multi-campuses would drag down the flagship campus.  It did not  in\r\n\r\nthe UNC system.  We do not think it would in ours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the form, the over-arching mission for\r\n\r\nuniversities  to  bring wealth to Singapore will  remain  the\r\n\r\nraison  d'etre.   My committee will need  to  study  all  the\r\n\r\noptions of expansion carefully and examine which will  create\r\n\r\na university sector that is best for Singapore.  We target to\r\n\r\ncomplete our study by the end of 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a final note, I could not agree more with Mr Zainul\r\n\r\nAbidin when he says that we must inculcate a sense of bonding\r\n\r\nand  social  responsibility in our graduates  from  ITE,  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics and the universities.  We have chosen to  invest\r\n\r\nheavily in their education for a brighter future.  It  is  up\r\n\r\nto  each of them to determine how he or she repays that  debt\r\n\r\nto society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> On a point of clarification,\r\n\r\nSir.

In  view  of  these\r\n\r\nrealities, I am proud and glad to know that MOE has  started,\r\n\r\nfor  several years now, a special scheme called the  Learning\r\n\r\nSupport  Programme  (LSP)  to  assist  students  with  innate\r\n\r\nlearning problems.

How many students are undergoing the Learning\r\n\r\nSupport  Programme, and what is the success rate?   What  are\r\n\r\nthe  plans  of the Ministry to extend this programme  to  all\r\n\r\nschools  and at all levels?

Should there be a limit?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school's sports scene, I believe, is premised on the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of bringing out the best endeavours of our  school\r\n\r\nboys and girls through amateur sports.  It is founded on  the\r\n\r\nspirit competition that seeks to rely as much as possible  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own ability and resources in order to achieve sporting\r\n\r\nglory.  This spirit of self-reliance is important in that  it\r\n\r\nhelps  to build and bring out the character and determination\r\n\r\nof  the  sportsmen  and  sportswomen through  hard  work  and\r\n\r\ntraining.   This  spirit is in keeping  with  the  ideals  of\r\n\r\neducation, of which sports is a necessary part.  With limited\r\n\r\nresources  in  our  schools, we have a level  playing  field.\r\n\r\nHard  work  and training will allow every school to  stand  a\r\n\r\nchance   of   attaining  national  glory   through   sporting\r\n\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, enlisting outside help for massive resources may\r\n\r\nlead  to  adverse consequences.  First, not every  school  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   has  a  rich  alumni  to  generously  fund   such\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   If such funding was allowed, it would  rob  the\r\n\r\nincentive  of the other schools, which are not so  generously\r\n\r\nendowed, to compete or participate in competition where  they\r\n\r\nknow the playing field is not level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if we allow generous funding for selected\r\n\r\nsports, it would be possible for the schools to bring in top-grade  sportsmen  or foreign talent, and  leverage  on  these\r\n\r\nsportsmen  to  win  national glory.  A friend  of  mine  once\r\n\r\nremarked to me that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith that level of funding, there is no need for the boys  to\r\n\r\ntrain  hard.  All they need to do, for example, is  to  bring\r\n\r\nthe top Fijian or New Zealand boys team to play for them.  If\r\n\r\nthat were so, would our boys and girls find the incentive  to\r\n\r\nwant to train hard for competition?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, sports in school have the objective of instilling\r\n\r\ncharacter   and  discipline  in  our  children.    I   would,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  like  to  ask the Minister whether  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nwould  consider  regulating  the  extent  to  which  external\r\n\r\nfunding may be provided for sports in schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> Madam, we all agree and know that\r\n\r\nmany  parents  are  very  concerned  about  their  children's\r\n\r\nfuture.   Speaking as a parent myself, we worry  whether  our\r\n\r\nchildren  can  cope with the extremely competitive  education\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we parents are more concerned than our children.\r\n\r\nWe  are  so  afraid of our children not having the best  and,\r\n\r\nwhenever possible, many would try their best to assist  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  This feeling is so strong that even in the  choice\r\n\r\nof  the  co-curricular activity or the CCA choice,  we  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  tell our kids what they should choose.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthis is one area where we should let our children decide  and\r\n\r\nchoose for themselves.  This choice should be based on  their\r\n\r\npersonal  interest and talent.  And this is one area  outside\r\n\r\nof  the  academic  field that I feel we can choose  to  groom\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we want the education system to prepare the\r\n\r\nfuture  generations  for  the rapid changes  and  to  produce\r\n\r\nnimble, creative and innovative minds.  This should not  only\r\n\r\nbe  done in classrooms.  We must use the CCA and exploit  its\r\n\r\npotential  to  educate our students on the other  aspects  of\r\n\r\nlife.   CCA  should  not  be seen as a  chore  or  burden  to\r\n\r\nschools,  parents  and  staff but, rather,  as  an  important\r\n\r\nextension to education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through CCA, we can inculcate important values on\r\n\r\ndiscipline,  leadership,  social  interaction,   sports   and\r\n\r\nhealthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should invest in CCA and improve the programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Madam, as we grow as a young nation and\r\n\r\nfurther  improve  our education system, we should  strive  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  more holistic approach towards education.   Academic\r\n\r\nexcellence  should not be the only thrust  of  education.   A\r\n\r\nchild   should  be  nurtured  on  values,  such  as  national\r\n\r\neducation, community spirit, social services, voluntarism and\r\n\r\nsports.   This  will nurture a well-rounded  individual  with\r\n\r\nstrong  community  ties.  Ultimately,  our  education  system\r\n\r\nshould  aim to develop citizens who are able to put Singapore\r\n\r\nand  community  before self.  And I believe the co-curricular\r\n\r\nactivity is an important aspect of such a system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Madam, with the pressure of living\r\n\r\nmounting in every facet of life, including in our schools, it\r\n\r\nis important for us to continually build confidence and self-esteem,  particularly in our young.  The  Prime  Minister  is\r\n\r\nsensing  the erosion of Singaporeans' confidence as a  result\r\n\r\nof  the  economic downturn and has, in fact,  asked  us,  his\r\n\r\nfellow MPs, to lift the spirit and inject a greater degree of\r\n\r\nconfidence in our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, while he is seeing this in an economic context,\r\n\r\nsimilar  confidence  building should  also  be  done  in  our\r\n\r\nschools.    I   officiated  at  a  school  ceremony   in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency  recently where the National  Youth  Achievement\r\n\r\nAward  (NYAA)  scheme has been used to maximum  advantage  to\r\n\r\ninculcate  excellence and develop its students to their  full\r\n\r\npotential.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of over 300 students who participated in the scheme, 99%\r\n\r\nof  them received at least a Bronze Award.  This is no  small\r\n\r\nfeat considering the amount of time and effort the school has\r\n\r\nto  put in to make sure that all the students go through  the\r\n\r\nrigour of the entire course.  The students I met appeared  to\r\n\r\nbe very confident of themselves and are highly motivated.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to suggest that MOE adopt a strategy to  require\r\n\r\nall schools to send a certain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nminimum  number of their students to participate in the  NYAA\r\n\r\nScheme  so that these students could be role models  for  the\r\n\r\nrest of their school counterparts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Mdm Chairman, we have always taken\r\n\r\npride  in  our academic achievements.  Our children  have  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  performed much better than students  in  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  even  some  of  the  developed  countries.    The\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry must be given credit for  doing  a  great\r\n\r\njob,  especially  so in view of Singapore's small  population\r\n\r\nbase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, education is not just about academic\r\n\r\nachievements.  Academic development is only one component  of\r\n\r\na  person's  development.  We must aim to provide a  holistic\r\n\r\neducation  for  our children which aims to strike  a  balance\r\n\r\namong   academic,  physical,  emotional,  mental  and  social\r\n\r\ndevelopments.  In particular, I think there may be a need for\r\n\r\nus  to re-look at our curriculum to strengthen our efforts in\r\n\r\ncharacter building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three specific aspects need to be emphasised: moral\r\n\r\nvalues, social responsibility and capacity for failure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moral values: it is most crucial to teach our children\r\n\r\nthe  sense  of  right and wrong.  If we  fail  in  this,  the\r\n\r\nsociety  will  degenerate into lawlessness.   Our  basis  for\r\n\r\njustice  and  equality will disintegrate,  and  our  academic\r\n\r\nachievement will mean nothing in the end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social responsibility: we must inculcate in our youths\r\n\r\nthat they have a responsibility towards the society that they\r\n\r\nlive  in.   They are not just individuals striving for  their\r\n\r\nown success at the expense of others.  Instead, they need  to\r\n\r\nrecognise the needs of the society and see themselves as part\r\n\r\nof the solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capacity for failure: our own failures as well as those\r\n\r\nof others.  We must learn to be tolerant of failures.  We can\r\n\r\nthen be willing to take risks and venture out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the beginning of nurturing entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chairman, character building is a difficult\r\n\r\nsubject  to  teach, as it is a rather abstract  concept.   It\r\n\r\ncannot  be  taught through classroom lessons.  It has  to  be\r\n\r\nnurtured through life experiences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, in this regard, the community involvement\r\n\r\nprogramme (CIP) is an excellent initiative in building up the\r\n\r\ncharacter  of  our  students by involving them  in  community\r\n\r\nprojects.    However,   the   current   programme   has   its\r\n\r\nlimitations.  For example, the requisite hours of CIP is only\r\n\r\nsix  hours a year.  Hardly anything can be done in six hours.\r\n\r\nSome  schools  end up visiting old folk homes,  much  to  the\r\n\r\nannoyance  of the homes.  But do not get me wrong.   This  is\r\n\r\nstill  good effort.  However, I think the impact is  somewhat\r\n\r\nunlikely to be lasting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Ministry could consider providing some\r\n\r\nguidelines on the CIP programme, without stifling creativity.\r\n\r\nI  would also like to suggest to the Minister that we  should\r\n\r\nencourage schools to partner maybe selected voluntary welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  in designing and implementing CIP  programmes.\r\n\r\nThis  way, it will inject greater professionalism in the  CIP\r\n\r\nprogrammes  while at the same time reduce  the  load  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers.   Students may also find real life programmes  more\r\n\r\nenriching and more meaningful.  They may even grow  up  later\r\n\r\non to become volunteers.  For example, I know that NJC runs a\r\n\r\npartnership programme with the private hospitals to allow its\r\n\r\nstudents to be attached to the hospitals as assistants during\r\n\r\ntheir holidays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, character building is the key to building a\r\n\r\nprogressive,  committed  and  caring  people.   This  is  the\r\n\r\ncornerstone  of  our  nation building.  There  is  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying, \"Shi nian shu mu, ba nian shu ren\", which means  that\r\n\r\nit  takes  10 years to grow a tree but it takes 100 years  to\r\n\r\ngrow a man.  I would like to urge the Minister to review  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum programmes of our schools and our kindergartens to\r\n\r\nensure  sufficient attention is given to character  building.\r\n\r\nWe must start early, as early as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npre-schools, as character building is a lifelong process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mdm Chairman, I recently\r\n\r\ntalked  to  an  overseas scholar who told me  that  he  never\r\n\r\nreally understood what \"brilliant\" meant until he went to MIT\r\n\r\nin  Boston.   He  went  on to explain,   \"Brilliance  is  the\r\n\r\nability  to  think on your feet and deliver a very  confident\r\n\r\nand  eloquent argument when called upon.\"  According to  him,\r\n\r\nthere  are  many  brilliant  students  in  these  prestigious\r\n\r\nuniversities  who are highly eloquent and very  confident  in\r\n\r\ntheir presentation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I do not have the privilege of an overseas\r\n\r\neducation  but  I  do agree with this understanding.   To  be\r\n\r\nconsidered  brilliant,  one of the  key  ingredients  is  the\r\n\r\nability  to think on our feet, stand and deliver -  with  the\r\n\r\nconfidence and eloquence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confidence and eloquence are something that can be built\r\n\r\nand  trained.  Although not every child will grow up to score\r\n\r\n100  marks  for  eloquence, or become  super-confident,  they\r\n\r\nshould  at  least score an A or a B+ with more  training  and\r\n\r\nmore practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly speaking, I do not see this being emphasised in\r\n\r\nour  schools.   The  current  education  system  expects  our\r\n\r\nchildren to sit quietly and listen to the teachers in a class\r\n\r\nsetting.  When children make any noise, they are told to keep\r\n\r\nquiet  and shut up, or stand up and get out.  These acts  are\r\n\r\nnot  helpful  in  the  building of  confidence  and  speaking\r\n\r\nskills.   They  will all learn to keep their  mouths  tightly\r\n\r\nshut  like  the fishes in Jack Neo's movie, \"I  Not  Stupid\".\r\n\r\nThis will be at society's loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I hope the Education Minister can see this point\r\n\r\nof  view and look into implementing greater emphasis to  help\r\n\r\nbuild  the confidence of our children and students in  public\r\n\r\nspeaking,  encouraging them to speak up and  build  up  their\r\n\r\neloquence.  Together with the current curriculum and emphasis\r\n\r\non  knowledge  and  skills,  we will  have  developed  a  new\r\n\r\ngeneration  of  future leaders for Singapore - brilliant  and\r\n\r\ntalented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Madam, the number of\r\n\r\njuvenile delinquency cases has dropped from 3,400 in 1999  to\r\n\r\n2,500  in 2001.

In Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontext, these figures are still high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main concern is about the problem faced by students\r\n\r\nin  the  neighbourhood schools.  I notice that many of  these\r\n\r\nstudents  have  been recruited by street gangs  to  be  their\r\n\r\nmembers.  The  street gangs make use of them to sell  pirated\r\n\r\nCDs  in the  neighbourhood.  I am worried about their future.\r\n\r\nI  often  wonder  what  else  can these  young  and  innocent\r\n\r\nstudents do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street gang members who come from low-income families\r\n\r\nprobably  were  forced by circumstances to  join  the  gangs.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  they wanted more income.  It may well be that  they\r\n\r\nare under the illusion that these street gangs can offer them\r\n\r\nmore  protection and care than what their families could give\r\n\r\nthem!  Their parents have to work the whole day, and probably\r\n\r\neven at night, to make ends meet. They are unable  to monitor\r\n\r\nthe activities of their children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for those coming from middle and upper-income\r\n\r\nfamilies  they  probably  join them  because  they  want  the\r\n\r\ncompany  of  these \"friends\". Perhaps they are the  neglected\r\n\r\nones. Although their parents can offer them material comfort,\r\n\r\nthey lack the concern, guidance and support of their parents.\r\n\r\nVery often, the gang leaders are normally those who have  the\r\n\r\nmost pocket money to spend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must consider ourselves lucky that in Singapore,\r\n\r\npossession and carrying of  guns and other dangerous  weapons\r\n\r\nare  prohibited.

And if we do  not  address  this\r\n\r\nearly, they will become bolder and more daring.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, may I ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the steps that have been taken to curb\r\n\r\nthese teen-gang problems?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Are enough resources in place to assist students to\r\n\r\nquit the teen-gangs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the common traits, if any, among the\r\n\r\nstudents that are involved in gangs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Is there a task force at national level to tackle\r\n\r\nthis issue?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Mr Zainudin and Dr Teo Ho Pin spoke\r\n\r\nabout the Learning Support Programme (LSP).  Both Mr Zainudin\r\n\r\nand  Dr Teo asked if LSP could be extended to Primary  3  and\r\n\r\nbeyond.   Mr Zainudin asked whether the LSP would be expanded\r\n\r\nto include more subjects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Learning Support Programme is an early intervention\r\n\r\nlanguage and literacy programme, first introduced in  primary\r\n\r\nschools in 1992, to provide additional support to students in\r\n\r\nPrimary  1  and Primary 2 who are educationally `at-risk'  of\r\n\r\nfailing in school.  Each year, about 10% to 15% of Primary  1\r\n\r\nand  Primary 2 students are supported in the Learning Support\r\n\r\nProgramme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LSP is implemented in all primary schools. The\r\n\r\nschools  are  provided with an additional  teacher  and  this\r\n\r\nallows  students in the LSP to be taught in small  groups  of\r\n\r\neight to 12.  Where the school cohort is large or has a  high\r\n\r\nproportion of `at-risk' students, a second additional teacher\r\n\r\nhas  been  provided.  A purpose-built classroom for  LSP  has\r\n\r\nalso  been factored into all new schools and those undergoing\r\n\r\nPRIME.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, Learning Support Programme students start\r\n\r\nschool  at  P1  with  limited reading skills,  equivalent  to\r\n\r\nchildren  of less than five years of age.  In 2001, after  10\r\n\r\nmonths of intervention in LSP, the average reading age of LSP\r\n\r\nstudents  increased  to  seven  years  of  age.   They   were\r\n\r\ntherefore almost on par with the rest of the Primary 1 cohort\r\n\r\nin  terms  of their reading skills.  Improvements in  reading\r\n\r\ncarry  over  to  the  classroom, and increase  the  students'\r\n\r\nability  to  learn new materials.  This is reflected  in  the\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  pass  rates of students  in  the  LSP.   For\r\n\r\nexample, in 2001, less than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhalf  (45%) of Primary 1 LSP students passed English  at  SA1\r\n\r\n(or   mid-year   examination).   By  the   second   semestral\r\n\r\nexamination at the end of the year, the pass rate was 65%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of Primary 1, 60% of the LSP students are\r\n\r\ndischarged  from  the  programme.   The  remaining   students\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  receive  support  in  Primary  2.   These   are\r\n\r\ntypically  students who have failed the semestral examination\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of Primary 1, or whose reading ages  are  still\r\n\r\nbelow their chronological age.  Given another year of support\r\n\r\nin   Primary   2,   the  majority  of  these  students   will\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  bridge the gap with their peers,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nliteracy and language skills.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LSP is now in its 11th year of implementation. Over\r\n\r\nthe years, the programme has developed and improved such that\r\n\r\nwe  are currently obtaining results that are close to optimal\r\n\r\nlevels.  MOE allocates resources according to what will  work\r\n\r\neffectively  in meeting the different needs of our  students.\r\n\r\nInstead of extending the LSP to Primary 3, we will focus  our\r\n\r\nresources on introducing an LSP for Mathematics, as this  has\r\n\r\nbeen identified as an area of need by schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LSP for Mathematics is currently implemented in 50\r\n\r\nschools  for  this year on a pilot basis.  These schools  are\r\n\r\nprovided   with  an  additional  teacher  to  implement   the\r\n\r\nprogramme.   A  two-year study is underway to  determine  the\r\n\r\noptimal level of implementation for LSP for Mathematics.   If\r\n\r\nproven  successful, the programme will be rolled out  to  all\r\n\r\nschools in phases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other than the LSP, we have another programme to\r\n\r\nhelp  students at lower primary level who have problems  with\r\n\r\ntheir  work.   We  call  it the Encouraging  Achievement  and\r\n\r\nBetter  Learning programme (ENABLE).  Started  in  1989,  the\r\n\r\nENABLE  programme is a focused diagnostic remedial  programme\r\n\r\nthat  caters to the underachievers in Primary 1 to Primary  3\r\n\r\nwith at least average ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach school has an ENABLE coordinator and teachers trained to\r\n\r\nprovide  systematic remediation for identified underachieving\r\n\r\npupils.   Trained  teachers provide  remediation  in  English\r\n\r\nand/or Mathematics with an emphasis on diagnostic teaching to\r\n\r\nunderachievers   twice   a   week  after   curriculum   time.\r\n\r\nApproximately  13%  to 17% of P1 to P3 students  are  in  the\r\n\r\nENABLE programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On co-curricular activities, Mr Zainudin asked about\r\n\r\nplans  to  enhance  the  CCA programme.   He  also  spoke  of\r\n\r\nparents'  concerns about the children spending too much  time\r\n\r\non  CCA.   Mr  Zainudin urged that parents let  the  children\r\n\r\ndecide on the CCA that the children would like to participate\r\n\r\nin.   I  think  we should leave it to parents to decide  with\r\n\r\ntheir  children what best suits the children.  I do not think\r\n\r\nMOE  would want to meddle in what parents and students should\r\n\r\nbest decide for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gan Kim Yong spoke of the importance of character\r\n\r\nbuilding   and  national  education.   Schools  place   great\r\n\r\nimportance  on character development and national  education.\r\n\r\nWe  actively promote character development through the  Civic\r\n\r\nand Moral Education programme, CCA programme and the pastoral\r\n\r\ncare   programme.   The  CCA  programme  forms  an   integral\r\n\r\ncomponent  of  our  education system.  Sports  is  one  major\r\n\r\ncomponent  of  the school's CCA programme.  The  other  areas\r\n\r\ninclude  the  uniformed groups, music and dance, and  various\r\n\r\nclubs  and  societies.  CCA engages students in a  meaningful\r\n\r\nway,  provide  opportunities  for  character  and  leadership\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  and promote the acquisition and application  of\r\n\r\nsocial and cooperative skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Gan's remark that schools should partner with\r\n\r\ncommunity  development, I think I fully agree with  him.   In\r\n\r\nfact,   schools   are  already  partnering   with   community\r\n\r\norganisations  in  implementing  the  Community   Improvement\r\n\r\nProgramme (CIP).  I think we can encourage more schools to do\r\n\r\nthat  so that not only would their partners benefit, but  our\r\n\r\nstudents   too  would  benefit  from  learning  in  providing\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage innovation, independent schools have been\r\n\r\ngiven the autonomy to decide on the niche it wants to develop\r\n\r\nin.   I  would like to inform Mr Sin Boon Ann that MOE  funds\r\n\r\nIndependent  Schools  on  the  same  per  capita   basis   as\r\n\r\nGovernment  secondary  schools.   MOE  has  no  objection  if\r\n\r\nindependent  schools can acquire additional funding,  whether\r\n\r\nthrough  sponsorship or fund raising activities,  to  put  in\r\n\r\nplace  various  schemes  in order to provide  a  well-rounded\r\n\r\neducation for their students.  MOE will not disallow ACS  for\r\n\r\nbuilding  its own swimming pool, even though it may give  ACS\r\n\r\nan  unfair advantage over other schools in swimming.   So  we\r\n\r\nare even-handed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Gan for highlighting the\r\n\r\nimportance of character building.  As I mentioned earlier, we\r\n\r\nhave  also  developed and implemented the National  Education\r\n\r\nprogramme  since 1997.  National Education,  which  places  a\r\n\r\npremium on responsible citizenship, has been integrated  into\r\n\r\nthe  different  subjects  and  incorporated  in  many  school\r\n\r\nactivities.   Besides  these, each  student  is  required  to\r\n\r\nperform a minimum of six hours of community service under the\r\n\r\nCommunity Involvement Programme and go on a Learning  Journey\r\n\r\neach  per  year.  Through the CIP, we help to instil  in  our\r\n\r\nstudents  a  conscience to give back to society  and  develop\r\n\r\nthem  into  socially  responsible adults.   Through  Learning\r\n\r\nJourneys,  we  hope our students will be able  to  complement\r\n\r\ntheir learning in the classroom of what makes Singapore tick,\r\n\r\nand foster bonding among themselves as they observe and learn\r\n\r\nabout Singapore's vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, because of the vast range of co-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities   in   schools,   MOE  developed   the   Character\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Programme in 2001 to guide schools in  providing\r\n\r\nfor  a  balanced programme for each student in three domains:\r\n\r\n(1)  leadership, (2) citizenship, and (3) personal and social\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   Activities  in  the  leadership   domain   are\r\n\r\ndesigned  to provide opportunities for students  to  lead  as\r\n\r\nthey serve, and to serve as they lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder  the  citizenship domain, activities are  organised  to\r\n\r\nhelp  students acquire values, such as loyalty and commitment\r\n\r\nto  nation.  In the social and personal domain, students  are\r\n\r\nexposed  to  activities  that  heighten  their  awareness  of\r\n\r\noneself and their relationship with others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the average, students attend CCAs once a week with\r\n\r\nsome  doing it twice a week.  Generally, students  find  CCAs\r\n\r\nmanageable, fun and enjoyable, and therefore do not  consider\r\n\r\nit  as a burden, or source of stress.  In many instances, the\r\n\r\ninterest  acquired through participation in a particular  CCA\r\n\r\nbecomes  a  life-long  pursuit  and  the  friendships  formed\r\n\r\nlasting ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the academic development of children is important,\r\n\r\nparents   should  not  overlook  the  fact  that   purposeful\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  CCAs provides a good balance  to  academic\r\n\r\npursuits  in schools.  It also provides our students  with  a\r\n\r\nwell-balanced  life  and  holistic  education.   Parents  and\r\n\r\nschools should help children manage their time well, so  that\r\n\r\nthey can cope with both school work and CCAs.  So we will not\r\n\r\nmeddle  but  we  hope parents will be able  to  advise  their\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ahmad Magad would be pleased to note that MOE\r\n\r\nrecognises  students'  involvement  in  the  National   Youth\r\n\r\nAchievement  Award (NYAA) scheme as part  of  their  CCA  and\r\n\r\nawards  them CCA points.  Since the NYAA's inception in  1992\r\n\r\nand  up  to  January  this  year,  34,000  youths  have  been\r\n\r\nregistered  in  the  scheme and, of this, 90%  are  secondary\r\n\r\nschool students.  To date, 10,000 students from 171 secondary\r\n\r\nschools,  junior  colleges  and centralised  institutes  have\r\n\r\nreceived   the  various  NYAA  awards.   This  is  a   strong\r\n\r\nindication  that  students  in  our  secondary  schools   are\r\n\r\nactively  involved in the NYAA scheme.  In fact,  the  scheme\r\n\r\nhas been so successful and well received by secondary schools\r\n\r\nthat it will now be extended to 10 primary schools on a pilot\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia spoke about the need for students to\r\n\r\ndevelop confidence and eloquence.  The building of confidence\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neloquence   requires  a  combination  of  verbal  competence,\r\n\r\ncritical  thinking,  emotional control  and  opportunity  for\r\n\r\npractice.   The development of verbal competence is  provided\r\n\r\nfor  in  the academic curriculum, which emphasises crititical\r\n\r\nthinking  and  the acquisition of language and  communication\r\n\r\nskills.  Schools provide students with life skills lessons to\r\n\r\nequip  students  with  tools for personal  and  interpersonal\r\n\r\neffectiveness.    Schools  also  provide  opportunities   for\r\n\r\nstudents  to  develop  self-confidence through  co-curricular\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, on school discipline, Mr Zainudin and Mr Ong Ah\r\n\r\nHeng  raised  some concerns regarding school  discipline  and\r\n\r\ngangsterism.  I would like to assure Mr Zainudin and  Mr  Ong\r\n\r\nthat  the overall state of discipline in our schools is good.\r\n\r\nSerious  cases  of  breach of discipline are  infrequent  and\r\n\r\ngangsterism is not a problem in school.  The Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs' statistics indicate that the number of students aged\r\n\r\n12  to  19 years who are dealt with for involvement in  gang-related  activities is low.  There were 142 in 1999,  154  in\r\n\r\nyear  2000, and 139 in year 2001.  So I am not sure  what  is\r\n\r\nthe  source  of information that Mr Ong had given  the  House\r\n\r\nearlier.   These form less than 0.06% of the students  within\r\n\r\nthis age range.  Girls account for a small proportion of  the\r\n\r\ncases of gangsterism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding, schools are mindful of the need to be\r\n\r\nvigilant   against  the  development  of  gangsterism   among\r\n\r\nstudents.   Schools have formal structures to  actively  deal\r\n\r\nwith  discipline problems.  When students are  identified  as\r\n\r\nbeing involved in gang-related activities, schools take steps\r\n\r\nto counsel them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1997, MOE has been collaborating with the Police\r\n\r\nto  set  up as one of the Inter-Ministry Committee  on  Youth\r\n\r\nCrime    initiatives,   the   Honorary   Voluntary    Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary  Scheme  (Hon  VSC  Scheme).   More   than   200\r\n\r\nDiscipline  Masters, Operations Managers  and  teachers  have\r\n\r\nsince been trained and appointed as Honorary VSC officers  in\r\n\r\nschools.   This serves as an extension of police presence  to\r\n\r\nkeep youth-gang influence away from our schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools cannot be solely responsible for the discipline\r\n\r\nof  our  young.  Parents, schools and the  community  have  a\r\n\r\nshared responsibility in ensuring the proper behaviour of our\r\n\r\nchildren.  Schools work closely with parents to involve  them\r\n\r\nin educating their children and to provide the necessary home\r\n\r\nsupport  to  sustain  the  changes in  behaviour.   MOE  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  work  with other Ministries  and  agencies  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  to  coordinate and develop initiatives  to  arrest\r\n\r\ndisciplinary problems and further improve school discipline.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Madam, the Compulsory Education Act\r\n\r\nhas  two  specific objectives.  The first is to  provide  our\r\n\r\nchildren  with a common core of knowledge, and the second  is\r\n\r\nto  ensure that they share a common experience.  Seen in this\r\n\r\nlight,  the  Act  is therefore an important piece  of  social\r\n\r\nlegislation.   Its key objective is to change  behaviour  and\r\n\r\nmindset towards education so that education is given the  top\r\n\r\npriority which it deserves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Act is timely, as the number of\r\n\r\nchildren who fails to register for Primary 1 has been  rising\r\n\r\nsteadily.   According to a newspaper report,  1,677  children\r\n\r\ndid  not register for Primary 1 in 1997.  It went up to 1,708\r\n\r\nin  1998 and, in 1999, it was 1,921, which is about 3% of the\r\n\r\ncohort.  In 2000 and 2001, it was estimated that about  2,000\r\n\r\nchildren  a year did not make it to school.  However,  in  my\r\n\r\nview,  legislating a problem alone will not make the  problem\r\n\r\ngo  away.   I  am  quite sure that even when the  MOE  starts\r\n\r\nenforcing  the  Act  next year, there  will  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nparents who will not register their children for Primary 1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to legislation, we need to identify what are\r\n\r\nthe  underlying  causes which prevent  parents  from  sending\r\n\r\ntheir  children to school and address them.  I am  aware  the\r\n\r\nreasons could include children who are sent to madrasahs,  or\r\n\r\nare  overseas, or are being taught at home.  Other than  this\r\n\r\ngroup,  other children could be kept away from school because\r\n\r\nof  their  parents'  ignorance,  poor  priority  accorded  to\r\n\r\neducation   and,   perhaps   a   major   concern,   financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister what measures have been put in\r\n\r\nplace  to identify and reach out to such children who are  at\r\n\r\nrisk, to render assistance to their families and to regularly\r\n\r\nmonitor them so that once they are attracted to school,  they\r\n\r\nwill not drop out of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, under this Act also, all students\r\n\r\nof  madrasahs are required to sit for the PSLE examination in\r\n\r\nthe  year  2011.   Madrasahs  suffer  from  a  constraint  of\r\n\r\nmanpower and other resources compared to the national schools\r\n\r\nand  they  will face difficulties in meeting the requirements\r\n\r\nof the Compulsory Education Act, if nothing is done to assist\r\n\r\nthem.   In  this  respect,  may  I  ask  the  Ministry   what\r\n\r\nassistance  is  being  rendered to  madrasahs  to  help  them\r\n\r\nprepare  their  students to sit for the PSLE examinations  in\r\n\r\n2001?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam Chairman, the Ministry's\r\n\r\ncontinued  effort  to  provide education  for  children  with\r\n\r\nspecial  disabilities, together with the VWOs,  and  NCSS  is\r\n\r\nindeed  commendable.   Despite these  improvements  made  and\r\n\r\nresources  committed to special education, there remain  some\r\n\r\nareas  of  concern, especially to parents  of  children  with\r\n\r\nspecial  needs.   I  would  like to highlight  two  of  these\r\n\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern refers to the high staff turnover and\r\n\r\nlow  morale  of  special school teachers.  I understand  that\r\n\r\nspecial schools are plagued by high staff turnover and  often\r\n\r\nlow  morale  among the teachers due to less attractive  terms\r\n\r\nand  conditions  of employment and poorer career  advancement\r\n\r\nprospects  compared  to  teachers in the  mainstream  school.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an  anomaly  because it  is,  without  doubt,  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  and  challenging to teach  children  with  special\r\n\r\nneeds  than  it is to teach mainstream pupils.   It  requires\r\n\r\nspecial training, a different set of skills, and a love  that\r\n\r\ntranscends  physical handicap.  Those who  continue  in  this\r\n\r\ncalling despite such odds, exhibit a spirit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  noble self-sacrifice, and their life should not  be  made\r\n\r\nharder  by poor rewards and lack of recognition.  They should\r\n\r\nnot  be  made  to  feel  that teaching in  special  education\r\n\r\nschools belong to the realm of social welfare and it is not a\r\n\r\nlegitimate  profession and, therefore, can be  paid  a  lower\r\n\r\nsalary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern refers to integration into mainstream\r\n\r\nschools.   Madam,  children  with  special  needs  should  be\r\n\r\nintegrated  into mainstream schools where possible,  as  this\r\n\r\nwould help in the intellectual and social development of high-functioning  special-needs children.  Other children  in  the\r\n\r\nschool  can also benefit enormously by interacting  with  the\r\n\r\nspecial-needs   children  and  learn   that   they   have   a\r\n\r\nresponsibility towards these less fortunate kids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in this respect, I am pleased to note that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  currently  has six designated mainstream  secondary\r\n\r\nschools   that  admit  the  hearing-impaired  and   visually-handicapped  children.  I would like to urge the Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider  extending  this  programme  to  mainstream  primary\r\n\r\nschools.   Designated  primary  schools  in  each  region  of\r\n\r\nSingapore could be equipped to cater to children with special\r\n\r\nneeds  who  have  been assessed to be capable of  integrating\r\n\r\ninto mainstream schools.  This could take place, say, at  the\r\n\r\nupper  primary level, from Primary 4.  I understand that  the\r\n\r\nCanossian School for the Hearing Impaired already offers such\r\n\r\nopportunities.   However, there is a need for  more  of  such\r\n\r\nschools,  to  allow  as many children  as  possible  who  are\r\n\r\ncapable  of  integrating  into the mainstream  to  enrol  and\r\n\r\nbenefit  from the system.  Early intervention has been  found\r\n\r\nby  experts  to  be  of great importance  in  the  successful\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  of children with special  needs.   Hence,  we\r\n\r\nshould  provide such facilities at primary schools  that  can\r\n\r\nmaximise  the  chance of successful rehabilitation  of  these\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I feel that it is now time for us to work harder\r\n\r\non  building  our  social  capital and  accord  every  child,\r\n\r\nincluding those with special needs, a chance to develop their\r\n\r\npotential to the fullest.  I,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntherefore,  urge the Minister to consider the issues  I  have\r\n\r\nraised to further improve our special education system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Khor, would you like to continue with\r\n\r\nthe next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Madam, I wish to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> OK. Mr Gan Kim Yong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Madam, there have been recent studies\r\n\r\npointing to the value of pre-school education.  These studies\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  much  of  a child's capacity  to  learn  self-confidence, self-respect, his ability to communicate and  his\r\n\r\nattitude towards learning are determined during the first six\r\n\r\nyears   of  a  child's  life,  before  the  start  of  formal\r\n\r\neducation.  There have been some suggestions in the past that\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  of  pre-school education may not  be  lasting.\r\n\r\nHowever,  long-term  studies have now been  done,  and  these\r\n\r\nstudies  show that children who have had pre-school education\r\n\r\ntend  to do better later in life, even as late as age 27,  at\r\n\r\nwhich  the  study  was done.  These are in  terms  of  social\r\n\r\nresponsibility,   educational   performance   and    economic\r\n\r\nachievement.   By  that,  it  means  how  much   they   earn.\r\n\r\nObviously,  these  studies have their  limitations,  but  the\r\n\r\nresults  warrant a serious review of our policy towards  pre-school education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the Ministry of Education spends $16,600 per\r\n\r\nuniversity  student at the top of the scale, and  $3,200  per\r\n\r\nprimary  school  student  at  the  other  end.   I   am   not\r\n\r\nquestioning  the basis of this ratio.  However, I  am  rather\r\n\r\nsad  that  we spend little or almost nothing at all  on  pre-school  education.  A total of 98,000 children are  attending\r\n\r\nkindergartens  today.  A significant number of  our  children\r\n\r\neither  do not go to kindergartens or they drop out  after  a\r\n\r\nshort  while.   Based on my discussions with  some  self-help\r\n\r\ngroups,  most  of these tend to be the lower income  families\r\n\r\nwho  could  not  afford  the  unsubsidised  fees.   As  these\r\n\r\nchildren  move  on  to  primary level,  they  would  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  compete  with those who  have  had  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation.  Yet, the same families would again find it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult to provide added help, such as tuition classes,  to\r\n\r\nhelp them catch up.  It is, therefore, a double jeopardy  for\r\n\r\nthese  families.  Pre-school education cannot equalise  every\r\n\r\nchild, but it certainly can at least narrow the gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to consider\r\n\r\nproviding  more resources to pre-school education.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to suggest that at least the following areas should  be\r\n\r\nlooked  into.   Firstly, providing funding for selected  non-profit  kindergartens; secondly, provide guidelines on  basic\r\n\r\ncurriculum;  and, thirdly, specify minimum qualifications  of\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For funding, the Government should not subsidise\r\n\r\nkindergartens which are profit-oriented, but should  consider\r\n\r\nhelping those which are being run purely as social service to\r\n\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Gan, you will have to wrap up your\r\n\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Madam, other than providing funding,\r\n\r\nwe believe that the Government should also provide guidelines\r\n\r\non  basic curriculum that are broad enough to leave room  for\r\n\r\ncreative teaching.  There is also a critical need to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthe  quality of our kindergarten teachers, not just providing\r\n\r\nthe funding, but also to provide the teaching facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we have gone a long way in our formal education.\r\n\r\nMany  of  us  are proud of our achievements.  It is  time  we\r\n\r\nlooked  at  pre-school  education in  a  more  intensive  and\r\n\r\nfocused  manner so that it becomes an integral  part  of  our\r\n\r\ntotal  education  policy.  It will then  make  our  education\r\n\r\npolicy complete.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> At the risk of sounding like a\r\n\r\nspoilt  recorder, I would like to propose to the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  to seriously consider bringing the early childhood\r\n\r\neducation into the formal education system.  Put it  directly\r\n\r\nunder  the  purview of MOE.  This portion  of  our  education\r\n\r\nsystem  has mostly been left to  community organisations  and\r\n\r\nthe  private sector.  We know that the Ministry of  Education\r\n\r\nhas some initiatives and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogrammes in this area.  Are these enough?  Can we do more?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly believe we can and we should do more in the\r\n\r\narea  of  pre-school education.  As the pressure for economic\r\n\r\nexcellence  continues, we will see more  dual-income  earning\r\n\r\nfamilies.   Parents  need support to cope  with  the  growing\r\n\r\ntrends and phenomena.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many developed countries that have\r\n\r\nincorporated  pre-school  education into  primary  education.\r\n\r\nThere must be many reasons that compelled them to do so.   As\r\n\r\nwe  progress and more of our female citizens go out  to  join\r\n\r\nthe  workforce, we will encounter more demands for  a  better\r\n\r\nand  structured  pre-school system existing under  mainstream\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of the compulsory education law is a\r\n\r\nlandmark  decision  and,  I  believe,  the  next  significant\r\n\r\ndecision,  and  a  more important one, is to incorporate  the\r\n\r\nfoundation years into mainstream education provided by MOE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we must provide our children the equal\r\n\r\nopportunity to education at the earliest age possible.   Many\r\n\r\nexperts  have deliberated on the importance of the foundation\r\n\r\nyears, and many have agreed.  There are many parents in  this\r\n\r\nHouse and, if we, as parents, sincerely believe otherwise, we\r\n\r\nwould  not have sent our kids to nurseries and kindergartens.\r\n\r\nInstead, we are sending them to the best possible nursery and\r\n\r\nkindergartens.  Why is that so?  Does it mean that pre-school\r\n\r\nis  not important?  On the contrary, we know deep down in our\r\n\r\nhearts  that  it  is  important.  If so, I  still  could  not\r\n\r\nunderstand  why the Ministry of Education, which is  supposed\r\n\r\nto  be  the protector and torch-bearer of education  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  takes  a laissez faire attitude towards  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation when it can play a more decisive role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more senior Members of this House would probably be\r\n\r\nable to recall that in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1979, the pre-primary system was implemented in some schools.\r\n\r\nThe purpose was for bilingual education, ie, to give students\r\n\r\nequal  exposure  to  both Mandarin and  English.   It  was  a\r\n\r\nworthwhile  exercise and the Ministry of Education  then  had\r\n\r\nthe   motivation,  the  vision  and  boldness   to   see   it\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zainudin, can you please ask your\r\n\r\nquestions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin:</b> It was discontinued in 1989. Now,\r\n\r\nin  the  year 2002, we should ask ourselves: are the  reasons\r\n\r\nmore compelling?  The answer is yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Madam, for the pre-school system, the\r\n\r\nterrain is characterised by a bewildering array of choice  by\r\n\r\nany  parameter.  If we look at fees, we have a  few  tens  of\r\n\r\ndollars  of monthly fees to over a thousand dollars.   If  we\r\n\r\nlook  at  pedagogic methods, we have the whole range  -  from\r\n\r\nMontessori  to  all  forms  of  experimental  and  the   very\r\n\r\ntraditional classroom-based methods.  If we look at  it  from\r\n\r\nthe  angle of the sort of emphasis it has on language and  so\r\n\r\non,  again, there are some that are specialist or  known  for\r\n\r\ntheir English, and others for their Mandarin and so on.  This\r\n\r\nis  a diversity that ought to be celebrated and welcomed,  if\r\n\r\nit   were   underpinned   by  a  few   key   parameters   and\r\n\r\nconsiderations, and I would like to outline them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is quality assurance. We can have diversity\r\n\r\nin  teaching methods, classroom style and so on but,  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  the  day,  parents want to be assured  that  a  core\r\n\r\ncurriculum  that  is  necessary in preparing  the  child  for\r\n\r\nPrimary 1 is being delivered.  And this is one area  in which\r\n\r\nMOE  could make a difference.  The Ministry has said that  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not want to get involved in pre-school education.   But\r\n\r\nit  can  play the role of a quality assurer or, at  least,  a\r\n\r\nquality prescriber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is in the area of teacher training. Several\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have mentioned this.  I just want to  stress  the\r\n\r\npoint  that  we need to professionalise pre-school  teaching,\r\n\r\nand that means training is essential and the Ministry must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplay  a catalytic role in this regard, because the output  of\r\n\r\nthe PSE system is the input of the primary school system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the issue of access, it would be desirable\r\n\r\nfor  us to create a situation where every child would be able\r\n\r\nto  get access to at least two years of pre-school education.\r\n\r\nCost is an inhibitor and there are other factors as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago, Dr Aline Wong told this House - she was\r\n\r\nthen  the  Senior Minister of State for Education - that  MOE\r\n\r\nwas  embarking on a pilot research programme to establish the\r\n\r\nlong-term  cognitive and non-cognitive benefits of pre-school\r\n\r\neducation  so  that  the Ministry can assess  what  level  of\r\n\r\nGovernment investment is justifiable in pre-school education.\r\n\r\nThe  longitudinal study was expected to take seven years, but\r\n\r\nDr Wong did give the assurance that after two to three years,\r\n\r\nif  the preliminary result of the study were convincing,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry would act.  I would like to know what is the  status\r\n\r\nof this study and what actions the Ministry is contemplating.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Madam, I have only one question for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, and that is about the innovative  kindergarten\r\n\r\nin  Denmark.   I  read in the papers that  a  team  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education has visited Denmark and that they  have\r\n\r\nalso seen the innovative kindergartens there.  I believe  the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  that  team have found that Denmark's  innovative\r\n\r\nkindergartens have some relevance to Singapore at this  point\r\n\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denmark, although a very small country with only five\r\n\r\nmillion people, slightly more than Singapore, has produced 11\r\n\r\nNobel  Prize  winners.  That speaks a lot for  the  education\r\n\r\nsystem  in  Denmark.  I think it is good for us to study  the\r\n\r\neducation  system  there.  I certainly  would  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Minister  shall  be  introducing  some  of  the\r\n\r\nimportant features of the innovative kindergartens  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  team  saw in Denmark.  Perhaps the Minister  could\r\n\r\nenlighten us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Madam, I will answer the\r\n\r\nquestions that have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  raised on pre-school education.  Mr Zainudin has  asked\r\n\r\nabout  the  Ministry's policy towards the pre-school  sector,\r\n\r\nand   whether   the  Ministry  should  not   in   fact   take\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for the pre-school sector,  as  it  does  for\r\n\r\nschools.  Mr Gan Kim Yong spoke of the benefits of pre-school\r\n\r\neducation, and asked that the Government provide funding  and\r\n\r\ncurriculum  guidelines for pre-school education.  Mr  Iswaran\r\n\r\nspoke  about  the  ways  in  which we  could  raise  quality,\r\n\r\ncurriculum  standards and teacher training.   He  also  asked\r\n\r\nabout the progress of the Pre-school Steering Committee.  And\r\n\r\nI will come to Mr Chiam's point later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start by saying that the Ministry does not view\r\n\r\npre-school  education as providing children with a simplified\r\n\r\nprimary school curriculum in preparation for formal education\r\n\r\nat  Primary 1.  Pre-school education should aim to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndistinct  development needs of the child in his early  years.\r\n\r\nIt   should   aim   to  help  the  child  develop   socially,\r\n\r\nemotionally,  physically, and not just provide  literacy  and\r\n\r\nnumeracy skills to prepare the child for Primary 1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE has no intention of taking over the provision of pre-school education. Various community and private\r\n\r\norganisations  are providing a range of pre-school  education\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to cater to different needs.  It is important  to\r\n\r\npreserve this diversity for the very reason that there is  no\r\n\r\nsingle  model  for developing children at an  early  age.   I\r\n\r\nagree  fully  with  Mr Iswaran's comments in  this  regard  - diversity  is important, especially at the pre-school  stage.\r\n\r\nParents  should have a choice of pre-school models to  select\r\n\r\nfrom,  according  to their preferences and  their  children's\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of becoming a provider of pre-school education,\r\n\r\nMOE  is  therefore putting resources into areas  which  would\r\n\r\nhave  the  greatest  leverage on the  quality  of  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation.    The  Pre-School Steering Committee,  which  was\r\n\r\nchaired  by Dr Aline Wong, and which I now chair, is  an  on-going  Committee.  It has implemented a number of initiatives\r\n\r\nwhich are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfocused on key areas of leverage.  These include drawing up a\r\n\r\nset of Desired Outcomes of Pre-School Education, developing a\r\n\r\ncurriculum  framework,  setting standards  for  teachers  and\r\n\r\naccrediting teacher-training programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE is also putting in place a licensing scheme to\r\n\r\nregulate kindergartens and to help ensure that standards  are\r\n\r\nmaintained.  However, MOE has to regulate with a light touch.\r\n\r\nWe  can  set the requirements for teacher qualifications,  we\r\n\r\ncan encourage kindergartens to develop coherent curricula and\r\n\r\nwe  can  help  them to achieve good standards in delivery  of\r\n\r\nthat  curricula, but we cannot intrude to the extent that  we\r\n\r\neffectively run the kindergartens.  This licensing scheme  is\r\n\r\nbeing  developed.   It  will  be  introduced  soon.   It   is\r\n\r\nessentially  modelled on the scheme that MCDS has  for  child\r\n\r\ncare centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best way to leverage up the quality of pre-school\r\n\r\neducation  is by better training of principals and  teachers,\r\n\r\nand  by  attracting  and retaining well-qualified  personnel.\r\n\r\nThat  is why the Government has provided, beginning from this\r\n\r\nyear,  annual  recurrent grants to eligible kindergartens  so\r\n\r\nthat they can structure attractive pay schemes to incentivise\r\n\r\ntraining and to attract better qualified personnel.  Most pre-school  education  providers are  on  track  in  meeting  the\r\n\r\ntargets  that  have been set for training of  principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers.    The   Joint  MOE-MCDS  Pre-school  Qualification\r\n\r\nAccreditation Committee, which was set up last year,  has  to\r\n\r\ndate   accredited  33  courses  from  15  training  agencies,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  National  Institute of  Education,  Ngee  Ann\r\n\r\nPolytechnic and other private training organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran asked about the pilot study that was\r\n\r\nmentioned  a  while ago as part of the work of  the  Steering\r\n\r\nCommittee.   First, let me say that international studies  on\r\n\r\nthe benefits of pre-school education are varied.  That is why\r\n\r\nwe  are  embarking on a pilot study of our own, in the  first\r\n\r\ninstance to test the effectiveness of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew  curriculum  design and teaching methodologies  that  are\r\n\r\nbeing  put in place.  And in the longer term, to look at  the\r\n\r\nbenefits of improved pre-school education  -  the benefits in\r\n\r\nterms of cognitive development, social skills and so on.  The\r\n\r\ninitial  two-year  phase  of  this  longitudinal  study   was\r\n\r\nimplemented last year, and would be completed at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year.  The results will be made known at the  beginning\r\n\r\nof next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran had also asked if there will be a skills\r\n\r\nbenchmark of sorts for different subjects that are taught  at\r\n\r\npre-schools for students who are entering Primary 1.  MOE has\r\n\r\nconsidered  this  earlier  and decided  that  the  pre-school\r\n\r\ncurriculum framework will not benchmark skills for  different\r\n\r\nsubjects  in  relation  to  the  Primary  1  syllabus.    The\r\n\r\nframework  instead  emphasises the  holistic  development  of\r\n\r\nchildren  -  their  social skills, values, communicative  and\r\n\r\nmotor  skills,  self-concept and confidence, and  of  course,\r\n\r\ncognitive skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE is encouraging kindergartens to move away from the\r\n\r\ncurrent pre-dominantly academic focus towards a more balanced\r\n\r\ncurriculum  aimed at the all-round development of the  child.\r\n\r\nThere  are two reasons for this.  The first is that cognitive\r\n\r\ndevelopment of a child in these early years proceeds hand  in\r\n\r\nhand  with  the  development  of these  other  basic  skills,\r\n\r\nincluding social and communicative skills that enable a child\r\n\r\nto  listen  with  understanding, to express  himself,  to  be\r\n\r\ncurious, and to explore.  A second reason relates to what  Mr\r\n\r\nGan  Kim Yong mentioned, which is the importance of character\r\n\r\ndevelopment, and the fact that the building of the  character\r\n\r\nhas  to  begin  in  the  early  years.   The  new  curriculum\r\n\r\nframework will be disseminated at the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam had commented on the need for kindergartens to\r\n\r\nbe more innovative and interesting and referred to the Danish\r\n\r\nexperience.   One  objective  of  developing  the  pre-school\r\n\r\ncurriculum framework is to help kindergartens in planning and\r\n\r\nimplementing more innovative programmes.  Currently, there is\r\n\r\na range of approaches adopted in the kindergartens.  Some of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  are  quite  innovative.  Some  kindergartens  emphasise\r\n\r\nchild-directed learning.  Others have adopted approaches such\r\n\r\nas  project work, real life situations, field trips, interest\r\n\r\ncorners,   dramatisation  and  role-playing,  and  fun-filled\r\n\r\nlanguage  activities.  More kindergartens are also  involving\r\n\r\nparents  in learning activities during curriculum time.   The\r\n\r\nDanish  experience is interesting and so are the  experiences\r\n\r\nof  some other countries which we intend to study.  There  is\r\n\r\nsomething to be learned.  The Danish experience is, in  fact,\r\n\r\none  which focused, at an initial stage, principally  on  the\r\n\r\ntraining of teachers. This is what we are seeking to do  now.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the first and most important step in leveraging  up\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  pre-school education. We will  continue  to\r\n\r\nstudy  these overseas experiences and learn what we can  from\r\n\r\ntheir strengths, as well as their weaknesses, as we go along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On compulsory education, Mdm Halimah raised the issue of\r\n\r\nparents  who  may  not  register their children  for  primary\r\n\r\nschool, even though compulsory education will be coming  into\r\n\r\neffect  next  year.  Compulsory education will be implemented\r\n\r\nfrom  next  year.  Registration for  Primary  1  in  national\r\n\r\nprimary schools will take place in July and August this year.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be  media  announcements and  publicity  on  the\r\n\r\nexercise.  Parents will be reminded that compulsory education\r\n\r\nwill  be implemented from 2003, what this means and how  this\r\n\r\ncan  help  their  child. The extent of  non-registration  for\r\n\r\nPrimary 1 for 2003 will only be known in September this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE does try to visit all cases of non-registration\r\n\r\nwhere  they  are  contactable.  We will be  deploying  people\r\n\r\nafter this year's exercise to visit homes to counsel families\r\n\r\nto register their children for school. If they have financial\r\n\r\nproblems,  we will get the community to help them and  advise\r\n\r\nthem   that  the  school  can  help  them  after  they   have\r\n\r\nregistered.   Financial difficulties are not a reason  for  a\r\n\r\nchild not attending school. They can be attended to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah also asked about the preparedness of the\r\n\r\nmadrasahs for compulsory education.

First,  let\r\n\r\nme thank her for her encouragement and positive remarks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has asked regarding the possibility of integrating\r\n\r\nspecial  schools  with normal schools.  We have,  already  in\r\n\r\nplace,  a  multi-tier system to provide for the education  of\r\n\r\nspecial  needs  children.  Those who are able to  follow  the\r\n\r\nmainstream  curriculum study in the mainstream  schools.   In\r\n\r\ncertain designated schools, special facilities and additional\r\n\r\nresources  are  provided to help them in their learning.  For\r\n\r\nexample, we have about 502 pupils with hearing impairment and\r\n\r\n61  with visual impairment in our mainstream schools.   Other\r\n\r\nchildren  who  need  specialised programmes  and  paramedical\r\n\r\nsupport  are  better  served  in  the  19  special  education\r\n\r\nschools.  The key word is capability.  If they can cope  with\r\n\r\nthe  mainstream  curriculum,  we  will  expand  the  capacity\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1999, MOE has increased its provision of\r\n\r\nfacilities and resources for disabled children, both  in  the\r\n\r\nmainstream  and  SPED schools.  These include one  mainstream\r\n\r\nschool per cluster to be fitted with full facilities for  the\r\n\r\nphysically handicapped, learning equipment for the mainstream\r\n\r\nschools   with  hearing  impaired  and  visually  handicapped\r\n\r\npupils, computer-related facilities for the SPED schools  for\r\n\r\nsensory-impaired   children  and   purchase   of   IT-related\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  maintenance  of  equipment  for  other  SPED\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCSS has also put into place a structured socialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme  to help mainstream schools and SPED school  pupils\r\n\r\nintegrate. The programme is working well and has proven to be\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards her comment that there is low morale and high\r\n\r\nstaff  turnover in these schools, first of all,  these  staff\r\n\r\nare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  NCSS, they are not under MOE.

According to the report, the root  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of commercial schools here is that  Singapore's\r\n\r\nthree universities provide places for no more than 15% of 18-year  olds.  The alternative of going overseas to be educated\r\n\r\nis  expensive.  The remaining option is thus to  enrol  at  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  school  offering an  overseas  degree  backed  by\r\n\r\noverseas institutions. The writer said, \"All you need to open\r\n\r\nup  a  school  in Singapore is approval from the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation (although you can call yourself a \"consultant\"  and\r\n\r\nget  away  without registering).\"  It seems so easy like  \"bo\r\n\r\njeng hu\" .\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask what is the Ministry's criterion in\r\n\r\napproving the registration of commercial schools.  Are  these\r\n\r\nschools  monitored  after  registration?  Does  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nmonitor  the  number  of  students taking  lessons  in  these\r\n\r\ncommercial schools?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, another issue I wish to raise is that there have\r\n\r\nbeen   many  suggestions  that  Singapore  universities   can\r\n\r\ncollaborate with Chinese universities to provide joint degree\r\n\r\nor  Chinese MBA programmes.  These suggestions are sound,  as\r\n\r\nit  will  not  only help establish networking,  it  can  also\r\n\r\npotentially  help more Singaporeans understand  China  better\r\n\r\nand strengthen our ability to ride on the China growth train.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I was told that the NUS has decided not to continue\r\n\r\nits  Chinese MBA programme.

In my answer regarding the university  sector,  I\r\n\r\nspoke that many proceeded in terms of fulfilling aspirations.\r\n\r\nWe  have kept that to a minimum in our public universities by\r\n\r\nmaintaining   high   standards.    Therefore,   the   private\r\n\r\ncommercial schools have now responded to their need.   Do  we\r\n\r\nwant  to keep an arm's length from it?  We would like to tell\r\n\r\nthe  public that they would very much have to investigate the\r\n\r\nschools  for  themselves.  We do not want to enter  into  the\r\n\r\nfray  to  decide which schools can.  It is not exactly  a  bo\r\n\r\njeng hu situation, as Mr Yeo Guat Kwang suggests.  We do have\r\n\r\ncriteria    in    registering   commercial   schools.     For\r\n\r\nregistration, we require private schools to demonstrate  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  adequate space and facilities  to  conduct  their\r\n\r\ncourses.  They are also required to report to MOE any changes\r\n\r\nto  the composition of their management committee, as well as\r\n\r\nappointment and termination of teachers.  For external degree\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  the degrees need to be granted by  a  bona  fide\r\n\r\noverseas  university, and should have minimum disparity  with\r\n\r\nwhat  is  offered by the same on campus in terms of  academic\r\n\r\nprogrammes.    However,  we  do  not  accredit   nor   accord\r\n\r\nrecognition to these external degree programmes,  as  it  may\r\n\r\ntake many forms, covering different disciplines, and can even\r\n\r\nbe delivered by correspondence, or over the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more practical approach for such programmes is to\r\n\r\nsubject themselves to the test of the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked about the NUS Chinese MBA programme.\r\n\r\nNUS  is  doing  exactly  what he  has  suggested.   They  are\r\n\r\ncollaborating  with the Bei Tah University.   Students  would\r\n\r\nspend  one  year in Bei Tah, and one year in  NUS,  taking  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  22  modules  in  both  English  and  Chinese.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the programme includes Student Exchange Programmes\r\n\r\nwith  some Chinese universities, such as the Xin Hua, Fu Tan,\r\n\r\nand  Xian  Jiau Dong University.

Has\r\n\r\nthe Ministry changed its policy? If so, why?  As it is today,\r\n\r\nwe  are  seeing more and more schools shifting to the  tender\r\n\r\nsystem,  and  the  successful bidders  then  subcontract  the\r\n\r\ncanteen  stalls out to third party stallholders.

Does  the\r\n\r\nMinistry monitor the prices regularly and try to prevent  the\r\n\r\nprices from being inflated?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mdm Chairman, I am\r\n\r\nraising the same issue.  Many a time when I met my residents,\r\n\r\nI received complaints that when the schools are upgraded, the\r\n\r\nprices of food at the canteen are also upgraded.  A plate  of\r\n\r\nchicken rice which used to be sold for 50 cents is now  being\r\n\r\nsold  at  $1, a 100% increase!  Last night, I met a  resident\r\n\r\nwho  is a hawker at the Ahmad Ibrahim School. He told me that\r\n\r\nthe  school would be upgraded next month, and an open  tender\r\n\r\nwill  be called for the operation of the school canteen. With\r\n\r\nthese canteens being operated on an open tender system,  soon\r\n\r\nwe will have \"Million Dollar Canteens\" just like the \"Million\r\n\r\nDollar Coffeeshop\" that we are having now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being the case, how are the students going to\r\n\r\nafford the food at the \"Million Dollar Canteen\"?  If you  are\r\n\r\noutside, you can say, \"Well, the food here  is too expensive,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  want  to  buy from here as  I  can  get  my  food\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\"  But,  if  you are in a  school,  you  cannot  go\r\n\r\noutside  to buy your food. If you do not buy from the  school\r\n\r\ncanteen,  you will just starve to death.  So, if a  plate  of\r\n\r\nchicken  rice is now being sold at $1 or $2 and even a  glass\r\n\r\nof soft-drink will cost 60 cents, I believe children from the\r\n\r\nlower  income group will not be able to afford  it.   If  the\r\n\r\npoor  family has three children studying in school, then  the\r\n\r\nburden  will be very heavy for the parents.  I hope that  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education would reconsider this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should have control over the prices. The canteen\r\n\r\nshould  be  let out to the operators at a nominal price.   We\r\n\r\nshould look after the children so that they have healthy food\r\n\r\nto eat.  As such, the school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncanteen  should be charged just a nominal rent,  and  not  an\r\n\r\nopen  tender price.  There must also be stipulations  on  how\r\n\r\nmuch they can charge for each food item.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the Adviser to the National Transport Workers'\r\n\r\nUnion.   We  have  some food kiosks at the bus  terminals  to\r\n\r\nserve our bus drivers. There, they charge 25 cents for a  cup\r\n\r\nof  coffee, and nothing more. A plate of fried noodle is  $1,\r\n\r\nand  that  is  it.  Of course, the food kiosk  operators  are\r\n\r\ncharged  very  nominal rents to operate at the bus  terminus.\r\n\r\nWe should look after the interest of the lower income people.\r\n\r\nWe must review this open tender system for school canteens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Madam, the school tuckshops exist\r\n\r\nprimarily  to  serve  the  needs  of  students.   Hence,  the\r\n\r\ncornerstone  of  MOE's tuckshop policy  is  the  welfare  and\r\n\r\ninterest of the students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are committed to ensure that tuckshop\r\n\r\nstallholders are able to provide not only good services,  but\r\n\r\nalso cater to the nutritional needs of students and that  the\r\n\r\nfood  sold  in  the tuckshop is wholesome, and at  reasonable\r\n\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary consideration for the selection of\r\n\r\nstallholders  is, therefore, the ability and  suitability  of\r\n\r\nthe applicants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single tender system introduced in 1987 provides an\r\n\r\nalternative  for  the  provision  of  tuckshop  services   to\r\n\r\nschools.  In line with MOE's policy of giving principals more\r\n\r\nautonomy in the administration of their schools, the existing\r\n\r\npractice  is that new schools, or schools to be relocated  to\r\n\r\nnew  buildings, can opt for the single tender system, as long\r\n\r\nas students get good value for their money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, a total of 16 Government schools, or 6% of the\r\n\r\ntotal  number of 253 Government schools, have opted for  this\r\n\r\nsystem.   The  number is quite small.  The  majority  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Government  schools are  still  on  the  individual\r\n\r\nstallholders'  system.   Under  the  single  tender   system,\r\n\r\nschools  call a tender to invite a single operator to  manage\r\n\r\nall the foodstalls in the tuckshop at controlled prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  bidding  rental  ranges from $320-$2,000  per  month  at\r\n\r\nGovernment  schools.   Irrespective  of  whichever   tuckshop\r\n\r\nsystems, schools are required to evaluate the food prices and\r\n\r\nquality proposed by the contractor or stallholder before they\r\n\r\nare awarded the right to run the stalls.  The single operator\r\n\r\nalso  would need to seek approval from schools to sublet  the\r\n\r\nstalls.   Schools  would need to ensure  that  this  approach\r\n\r\nwould not increase food pricing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On food prices, one perception of the single tender\r\n\r\nsystem  is that it may result in higher food prices.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nMr  Ong and Mr Yeo have raised this concern, and I am sure  a\r\n\r\nlot of Members here are concerned about that possibility.   A\r\n\r\nsurvey  conducted in September 1998 showed that  the  average\r\n\r\nprice  of food and drink items sold in school tuckshop  under\r\n\r\nthe  single  tender  system and those  under  the  individual\r\n\r\nstallholder  system,  was  of  little  difference.   Feedback\r\n\r\nreceived  from  schools  under the single  tender  system  in\r\n\r\nFebruary  2000 also showed that food quality and prices  were\r\n\r\nmaintained at reasonable level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it will take me probably until 7.00 pm if I were\r\n\r\nto  read  out the details of the difference in prices between\r\n\r\nthose  at  single  stall and individual  stallholder  system.\r\n\r\nBut, let me just give some examples.  Under the single tender\r\n\r\nsystem  (STS), at primary school level for cooked  food,  the\r\n\r\naverage  price  is  88  cents, whereas under  the  individual\r\n\r\nstallholder system is 81 cents.  So the difference is only  7\r\n\r\ncents.  For hot drinks, 44 cents at single tender system  and\r\n\r\n49  cents  at normal stall.  Cold drinks, 60 cents at  single\r\n\r\ntender  stall and 61 cents at individual stall.   So  on  the\r\n\r\naverage,  the  price is about 64 cents at the  single  tender\r\n\r\nsystem stall and 63 cents at the normal school stall.  So the\r\n\r\nprice difference is really marginal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each school has a school tuckshop committee to manage\r\n\r\nits  tuckshop.   This committee is chaired by the  Principal,\r\n\r\nand  comprises  representatives of the  school  staff.   This\r\n\r\ncommittee  monitors  the  food  quality  and  prices  in  the\r\n\r\ntuckshop  regularly to ensure compliance, and for consistency\r\n\r\nof the service quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has reduced the tuckshop fees for the\r\n\r\nindividual stallholder system in January 2002.  Under the new\r\n\r\nscheme,  individual stallholders pay only  a  nominal  rental\r\n\r\nranging  from  $5-$15  per  month,  depending  on  the  pupil\r\n\r\nenrolment in the school.  The previous rates ranged from $50-$60,  in  return  stallholders are to pay  utilities  charges\r\n\r\ndirectly  to  Power Supply.  Under PRIME,  about  90  schools\r\n\r\nwould be merged or relocated.  Schools which are affected  by\r\n\r\nmerger  would  have to go through a re-selection  process  of\r\n\r\nstallholders  since  the  number of stalls  available,  after\r\n\r\nmerger,  will be reduced.  The relocating schools can  either\r\n\r\nretain  their existing individual tuckshop stallholders,  opt\r\n\r\nfor the re-selection process or for the single tender system.\r\n\r\nExisting   stallholders  who  are  affected  by   merger   or\r\n\r\nrelocation of schools would be automatically shortlisted  for\r\n\r\ninterview, if they apply for a tuckshop stall, either in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  school, or in the new school.  Their past experience\r\n\r\nwill be give due consideration during the selection process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Is it not expensive to pay for an\r\n\r\naverage  of  60  cents for a cold drink, and if  I  heard  it\r\n\r\ncorrectly,  the Parliamentary Secretary said the  survey  was\r\n\r\nconducted  in September 1998?

It sets out key strategic\r\n\r\ndirections in balancing sustainable development and having  a\r\n\r\nquality   living  environment  in  Singapore.   As  Singapore\r\n\r\nrestructures  its economy, the composition of its  industries\r\n\r\nmay  change  drastically  from one of manufacturing-based  to\r\n\r\nhealthcare  and life sciences.  This poses new challenges  to\r\n\r\nour environmental management efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides adopting the existing principle of planning,\r\n\r\nmonitoring and enforcement, I would like to propose that  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Ministry conduct environmental  impact  analysis\r\n\r\nfor projects with high impact on the environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to seek the following clarifications from\r\n\r\nthe Minister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the key performance indicators for Green\r\n\r\nPlan 2012?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the key strategies to promote sustainable\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the key plans to manage solid waste in\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land scarce Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) How can the Ministry promote the development of\r\n\r\nenvironmental conscience among Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> The Singapore Green Plan 2012 in a way\r\n\r\nencapsulates  certain balances that have to be  made  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of  the  dilemma of development.   As  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nscaling   up   the   economic  ladder,   there   is   growing\r\n\r\ninternational  expectation that we will do our  part  in  not\r\n\r\njust  setting  a  good example in environment management  but\r\n\r\nalso  promulgating  and propagating it.  At  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans' own expectation of environmental issues and our\r\n\r\ncompliance  to them is rising.  And, yet, we have  to  assess\r\n\r\nthe  economic  impact  of  onerous  environmental  standards,\r\n\r\nespecially in this economic environment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich is very competitive and cost pressures are great.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see the Green Plan 2012 as an effort to address this\r\n\r\nchallenge  to meet Singaporeans' aspirations, to live  up  to\r\n\r\nour  responsibilities within the international community and,\r\n\r\nat  the  same time, trying to balance our economic and social\r\n\r\ninterests.   I do have, however, some specific questions  and\r\n\r\nproposals which I would like the Minister to respond to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that the plan outlines some very specific\r\n\r\ntargets that are to be attained over a 10-year period.   This\r\n\r\npertains  to  recycling rate where the target is  an  overall\r\n\r\n60%, that is, where 67% of land is to be water catchment  and\r\n\r\n60%  of  electricity generated is to be from natural gas.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask how realistic are these targets, given  our\r\n\r\ncity  state environment.  How do they compare with  developed\r\n\r\ncountries and are we over-stretching or keeping pace?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister what is the\r\n\r\npotential  impact  of such targets, and  the  Green  Plan  in\r\n\r\ngeneral,  on  businesses.  I am particularly concerned  about\r\n\r\nsmall  businesses, and whether compliance to some of the  new\r\n\r\ninitiatives that are being considered by the Ministry of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  might have an adverse effect on  business  cost,\r\n\r\nparticularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Green Plan envisages the people, private\r\n\r\nand  public  sector  involvement in the  realisation  of  its\r\n\r\nvision.  I would like to ask the Minister how the Ministry of\r\n\r\nthe  Environment proposes to educate and enthuse Singaporeans\r\n\r\naround  the goal of the Green Plan.  Singaporeans  have  been\r\n\r\nsomewhat apathetic to various efforts like recyling and other\r\n\r\nenvironment-friendly  measures.   How  can  we  ignite  their\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  and  get it going, so that the intention  becomes\r\n\r\naction?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in the Green Plan, I have not come across any\r\n\r\nspecific  proposal to promote Singapore as a  venue  for  the\r\n\r\nenvironment business.  There are many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninitiatives  today around the world, through  technology  and\r\n\r\nother  measures,  to  come  out  with  environmental-friendly\r\n\r\nsolutions to conventional problems.  The question is  whether\r\n\r\nSingapore can position itself well in that spectrum.  I would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask the Minister what plans his Ministry has in that\r\n\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Mdm\r\n\r\nChairman, Singapore today is clean and green.  However, if we\r\n\r\nlook into the future, with a growing population and expanding\r\n\r\neconomy, we are going to see more people on the street,  more\r\n\r\ncars on the road, more air-conditioners at homes, and at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  we  are  going  to see ourselves  consuming  more\r\n\r\nenergy,   maybe  producing  more  wastes.   It  is  therefore\r\n\r\nimportant that we do not take for granted that the clean  and\r\n\r\ngreen environment in Singapore will last forever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Chairman, just about 18 months ago, the World\r\n\r\nEconomic  Forum  commissioned  a  study  to  look  into   the\r\n\r\nenvironmental  sustainability of  various  countries  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   This  study came out with a ranking of  the  various\r\n\r\ncountries   along   the   line  of  an   ESI   (Environmental\r\n\r\nSustainability  Index).  122 countries were covered  by  this\r\n\r\nstudy.   When  the report came out, we found ourselves  being\r\n\r\nranked  tenth.   Not tenth from the top, but tenth  from  the\r\n\r\nbottom,  meaning that the study concluded that  Singapore  is\r\n\r\namong  the worst 10 countries in the world, in terms  of  our\r\n\r\nability to stay away from environmental disaster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion of this study is that Singapore, sooner\r\n\r\nrather  than  later, is going to face with a serious  problem\r\n\r\nwith  the  environment.  The ENV was taken by  surprise.   We\r\n\r\nstudied the report carefully.  We disagreed with the findings\r\n\r\nof  the  report.   So  we approached the research  group  and\r\n\r\nexplained to them that the sustainability of environment went\r\n\r\nbeyond  just natural endowment.  Because, at the end  of  the\r\n\r\nday,  there  are  still  these things  known  as  technology,\r\n\r\ninnovation,  discipline and determination.  Our point to them\r\n\r\nwas that Singapore because of our ability to make use of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnology,  our ability to come up with new  ideas  all  the\r\n\r\ntime,   our   willingness   to  be   disciplined,   and   our\r\n\r\ndetermination to ensure that the clean and green  environment\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  can be sustained over the long term,  we  have\r\n\r\nmade Singapore what it is today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some exchanges, the study team was half convinced.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, when they released the formal report at the\r\n\r\nWorld Economic Forum, we looked at the top of the report,  we\r\n\r\nwere not there; we looked at the bottom 10, we were no longer\r\n\r\nthere.  In fact, we came in  65th, in the middle of the table\r\n\r\nof  122 countries.  So it shows that the study team was  half\r\n\r\nconvinced  by our argument.  One year later, in January  this\r\n\r\nyear, the same study team produced a second annual report  on\r\n\r\nESI  ranking again.  This time round, the report was released\r\n\r\nin  New York city, because the World Economic Forum was  held\r\n\r\nin  New York City.  When the report was out, we looked at the\r\n\r\nbottom 10.  No, we were not there.  We looked at the top  10.\r\n\r\nWe  were  not there.  We looked at the middle 10.  Again,  we\r\n\r\nwere  not  there.  So we thought, what happened to Singapore?\r\n\r\nWe   went   through  the  whole  list.   In  fact,  Singapore\r\n\r\n\"disappeared\"  from the list.  What happened  was  the  study\r\n\r\nteam,  after one year of analysis, of looking at  the  model,\r\n\r\ncame  to  the  conclusion that Singapore is in a very  unique\r\n\r\nsituation.   Because there is no way they could  explain  the\r\n\r\nperformance of Singapore  -  based on the model  they come up\r\n\r\nwith,   they  decided to call Singapore  \"an  outlier\".   But\r\n\r\nthere  are two types of outlier - the positive type  and  the\r\n\r\nnegative  type.  Fortunately, in our case, they have  decided\r\n\r\nthat  we  were  a positive outlier.  Meaning that,  based  on\r\n\r\ntheir  model,  we  should  be living  closer  to  environment\r\n\r\ndisaster.   They do not know why Singapore is different  from\r\n\r\nthat particular model.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I relate this particular episode to convey the\r\n\r\npoint  that environmental sustainability is something not  to\r\n\r\nbe taken for granted.  Singapore is clean and green today not\r\n\r\nbecause  we have all the natural endowment to make  us  clean\r\n\r\nand green,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  because  we,  as  Singaporeans, as  Government,  as  one\r\n\r\npeople, work together all these years to ensure that  we  are\r\n\r\nclean,  we  are  green.   We created this  environment.   Our\r\n\r\nchallenge  is  to  continue  with  this  determination,  this\r\n\r\ncreativity,  this innovation, to ensure that we  can  sustain\r\n\r\nour clean and green environment for a long time to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that regard, I fully agree with Dr Teo Ho Pin on his\r\n\r\npoint  that  we need to balance sustainable development  with\r\n\r\nquality  living environment.  This is exactly the  vision  we\r\n\r\nhave  in the SGP 2012.  Our vision for the SGP 2012 is to  go\r\n\r\nbeyond  clean  and  green,  to strive  towards  environmental\r\n\r\nsustainability.   In other words, we are  not  talking  about\r\n\r\nimproving  our environmental performance in the  short  term.\r\n\r\nRather,  we  are  talking  about  how  we  can  sustain   our\r\n\r\nenvironment  for the long term.  This change  in  mindset  is\r\n\r\nvery  important  because  the only way  we  can  sustain  our\r\n\r\nenvironment   is   to  harness  the  full   commitment,   the\r\n\r\nparticipation  of  the 3P sectors - the  people  sector,  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector and the public sector - on an on-going basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran asked whether the targets we set under the\r\n\r\nSGP  2012  are  realistic  and whether  we  have  taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  cost to the industry.   This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant point.  I want to assure Mr Iswaran that the  whole\r\n\r\nreview exercise of the SGP 2012 is spearheaded by three focus\r\n\r\ngroups, with 51 members coming from the 3P sectors.   The  3P\r\n\r\npartners  together identified the challenges, formulated  the\r\n\r\nstrategies  and,  together,  they  set  the  targets.   These\r\n\r\ntargets  are not set by the ENV alone.  Rather, they are  set\r\n\r\nby  the 3P partners collectively.  Therefore, Mr Iswaran  can\r\n\r\nbe  rest  assured  that,  with the private  sector  being  an\r\n\r\nintegral  part of the exercise, the targets we set under  the\r\n\r\nSGP  2012  are realistic and pragmatic.  Further,  after  the\r\n\r\ntargets  were set, we put all the information on the Internet\r\n\r\nfor  the public to give their feedback over a 3-month period.\r\n\r\nThe  feedback period is over. We are now reviewing the draft,\r\n\r\nbased on the feedback we received from members of the public.\r\n\r\nWith the involvement of the 3P sectors, we now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  a  shared  vision in the SGP 2012.  We now  have  joint\r\n\r\nownership of the SGP 2012.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked what are the key performance\r\n\r\nindicators  we  have under the SGP 2012.  Mdm  Chairman,  the\r\n\r\nfirst  key thrust of the SGP 2012 is to ensure the innovative\r\n\r\nand efficient use of scarce resources to ensure that we would\r\n\r\nbe  able  to achieve environmental sustainability.   When  we\r\n\r\ntalk   about  innovative  use,  we  are  not  talking   about\r\n\r\ninnovation for the sake of innovation.  We are talking  about\r\n\r\ninnovation  with  a  specific  purpose  in  mind.   And  this\r\n\r\nspecific purpose in mind is to ensure that we would  be  able\r\n\r\nto  sustain environmental performance over the long term.  At\r\n\r\nthe same time, be able to reinvent the environmental industry\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   There are various key targets set  regarding\r\n\r\nthe innovative and efficient use of scarce resources.  Let me\r\n\r\nstart with solid waste.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall recycling rate of solid waste in Singapore\r\n\r\nreached  44% last year, after stabilising at 40% since  1996.\r\n\r\nOur aim under the SGP 2010 is to increase this recycling rate\r\n\r\nto  60% by year 2012.  At the same time, we aim to double the\r\n\r\nlife-span of Pulau Semakau from the 25-30 years today  to  at\r\n\r\nleast  50  years.   Mr  Iswaran asked how  does  this  target\r\n\r\ncompare  to the developed countries.  The target  of  60%  is\r\n\r\ncomparable  to  the best practices in the world.   Take,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the Netherlands, the Number 1 country in  recycling\r\n\r\ntoday.   They  have the highest recycling rate in  the  world\r\n\r\ntoday,  and it is about 65%.  In other words, if we are  able\r\n\r\nto  achieve  60%,  it will put us at least above  average  by\r\n\r\nglobal  standing.  We are also going beyond the 60% recycling\r\n\r\nrate.  We are going to adopt the best practice of Netherlands\r\n\r\nand  strive towards zero landfill.  This means as we  promote\r\n\r\nrecycling, we hope  the day will come when we do not need  to\r\n\r\nlandfill any refuse or waste.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second target we have set is regarding our\r\n\r\nwater  supply.   Our  target for the  next  10  years  is  to\r\n\r\ndiversify and increase water supply in Singapore, so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we  can become more self-sufficient.  Today, we  depend\r\n\r\nentirely on the conventional sources of supply, meaning local\r\n\r\ncatchment  water  as  well as the river water  imported  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia.   Over the next 10 years, our target is to  develop\r\n\r\nnon-conventional sources of supply, namely, desalination  and\r\n\r\nwater reclamation, so that these non-conventional sources  of\r\n\r\nsupply   will  complement  and  supplement  the  conventional\r\n\r\nsources  of  supply to account for about  25%  of  our  water\r\n\r\ndemand by the year 2012.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third target we have set is regarding the air\r\n\r\nquality in Singapore.  Over the next 10 years, we aim to keep\r\n\r\nthe  ambient air quality in Singapore to within the standards\r\n\r\nset by the World Health Organisation and the USEPA, and to be\r\n\r\ncomparable with the best cities in the world.  In the past 5-10  years, if we look at our PSI performance,  the PSI is  in\r\n\r\nthe  \"good\" range for about 60-80% of the year, except during\r\n\r\nthose  periods  when we were affected by the  regional  haze.\r\n\r\nOur aim for the next 10 years is to maintain this level of 60-80%  in the \"good\" range and, if possible, to strive for 85%,\r\n\r\nwith  the  remaining 15% in the moderate  range.   What  this\r\n\r\nmeans  is  that  we  need to make more use of  clean  energy,\r\n\r\nstrive  for greater energy efficiency and, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nto adopt best practices in pollution control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, all these strategies must cut across\r\n\r\nall  sectors  of  the economy and society, from  industry  to\r\n\r\npower  generation, to vehicular emission, to  the  commercial\r\n\r\nsector  and  to the public consumers.  Lastly,  we  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  air  pollution knows no boundary.  Therefore,  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  strengthen our regional effort to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nreturn of the regional haze.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fourth target we set is relating to public\r\n\r\nhealth.   Singapore  is  located in a region  where  tropical\r\n\r\ndiseases  are  endemic.  We aim to ensure the  low  incidence\r\n\r\nrate of food borne, water borne, vector borne and indoor  air\r\n\r\nborne  diseases.   We  have  to strengthen  our  surveillance\r\n\r\nsystem,  invest in applied research, collaborate with  public\r\n\r\nhealth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstitutions and work in partnership with the community.  Our\r\n\r\naim  over the next 10 years is to transform Singapore into  a\r\n\r\nleading  regional  centre  in the  research  and  control  of\r\n\r\ncommunicable  diseases that are transmitted by  food,  water,\r\n\r\nvector or indoor air.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Iswaran asked whether ENV could do\r\n\r\nmore  to  promote environmental awareness among Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nin  particular, the younger Singaporeans.  This is indeed the\r\n\r\nsecond  key  thrust of the SGP 2012, which is to promote  the\r\n\r\nactive   participation  of  all  to  sustain  quality  living\r\n\r\nenvironment  in Singapore.  In this regard, we are  going  to\r\n\r\npromote  3P  participation  in all  our  major  environmental\r\n\r\ninitiatives.   We  are  also going  to  step  up  efforts  to\r\n\r\nincrease   public   awareness,  public  education,   and   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen joint ownership in the 3P sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV is going to put our money where our mouth is. In\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  I am pleased to share with you  that  ENV  has\r\n\r\ndecided to set up a 3P Partnership Fund.  We have decided  to\r\n\r\nset  aside  $750,000 for collaboration with the 3P  partners,\r\n\r\nand  this money will come from our existing budget.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  instead  of  spending the money  conducting  our  own\r\n\r\nprogrammes, we have decided to set aside some of our existing\r\n\r\nresources to undertake programmes jointly with the 3P sector,\r\n\r\nand get it done through the 3P sector.  We hope that, through\r\n\r\nsuch  initiatives, we will be able to promote joint ownership\r\n\r\nin recycling and in various key environmental programmes.  In\r\n\r\nthis regard, we welcome any ideas and any proposals from  our\r\n\r\n3P partners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iswaran also asked what are the initiatives in SGP\r\n\r\n2012  to  promote environmental related industry.   He  asked\r\n\r\nwhether we have any intention to turn Singapore into a centre\r\n\r\nof  environment technology and to come out with environmental\r\n\r\nfriendly  solutions.  This is a very good  point  because  we\r\n\r\nlook at the environmental industry as an integral part of the\r\n\r\n3P partnership.  As we promote 3P\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npartnership,  as we engage the people sector in  our  various\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  it  is very important that  we  make  sure   the\r\n\r\nenvironmental  industry  is  able  to  offer  the   effective\r\n\r\nsolutions to solve our environmental challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ENV has embarked on an exercise, for more than\r\n\r\nsix months now, to re-invent the environmental industry.   We\r\n\r\nare  now  working towards upgrading the capabilities  in  our\r\n\r\nenvironmental industry, so that the industry will  make  more\r\n\r\nuse  of technology.  The jobs should be redefined, the skills\r\n\r\nof  the workers should be redeveloped so that, over time,  we\r\n\r\nwill be able to professionalise the industry and enhance  the\r\n\r\nimage  of the industry.  The ENV is now working very  closely\r\n\r\nwith  the  Waste  Management  and  Recycling  Association  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, which is the industry body.  At the same time,  we\r\n\r\nare  drawing  on  the  support of the various  public  sector\r\n\r\norganisations.  For example, the JTC is working  with  us  to\r\n\r\ncreate  an  eco-recycling park, with 19 hectares of  land  in\r\n\r\nTuas.  Our intention is to turn the eco-recycling park into a\r\n\r\nshowcase  of the environmental industry of the future,  where\r\n\r\nthe  deployment of technology, the redefinition of jobs,  the\r\n\r\nredefinition  of skills would be done in a concerted  manner.\r\n\r\nWe  will  also involve the unions to ensure that  Singaporean\r\n\r\nworkers will be able to benefit from this re-invention of the\r\n\r\nenvironmental  industry.  At the end of the day,  we  believe\r\n\r\nthat only by having a capable industry, an active people  and\r\n\r\na  responsive Government, can we have a strong 3P partnership\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third key thrust of SGP 2012 is to do our part for\r\n\r\nthe  global community.  We will continue to play a pro-active\r\n\r\nrole  in  the  regional  effort to  stamp  out  transboundary\r\n\r\npollution  threats, such as the regional haze.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  we are committed to fulfill our obligations to various\r\n\r\ninternational  agreements  that  we  are  party   to.    More\r\n\r\nimportantly,  we  are going to do more for the  international\r\n\r\ncommunity by supporting capacity building efforts.   Many  of\r\n\r\nthe  developing  countries  are now  pursuing  the  ideal  of\r\n\r\nsustainable development.  However, capacity building is a key\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchallenge faced by many of these developing countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ENV will continue to provide training to these\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries,  including the ASEAN neighbours and the\r\n\r\nsmall  island developing states.  We intend to  step  up  our\r\n\r\ntraining efforts and offer training not just in the technical\r\n\r\narea, but also in environmental management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the SGP 2012 will be formally launched in\r\n\r\nAugust.  It will be presented in World Summit for Sustainable\r\n\r\nDevelopment in September.  SGP 2012 is jointly formulated  by\r\n\r\nthe 3P partners, and it will require the joint efforts of the\r\n\r\n3P  partners for us to turn our vision of going beyond  clean\r\n\r\nand   green  towards  sustainability  into  reality.   I   am\r\n\r\nconfident  that,  as long as 3P partners  work  together,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be able to go beyond clean and green, and put Singapore\r\n\r\nfirmly on a path towards environmental sustainability.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Madam, I am indeed glad to learn from\r\n\r\nthe  Environment  Minister  that Singapore  has  been  tested\r\n\r\npositive  for the environment sustainability index.   Let  us\r\n\r\nnow discuss how can we sustain the water supply in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent press reports regarding the water agreement\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and Malaysia have raised much concern among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Many Singaporeans now recognise that water  is\r\n\r\na  strategic  resource,  and would  like  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nexplore ways to make Singapore self-sufficient in water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of ways Singapore can be self-sufficient in our water needs. Essentially, three key\r\n\r\nstrategies  can be adopted, namely, (1) increase  sources  of\r\n\r\nwater supply; (2) conserve water consumption; and (3) recycle\r\n\r\nused  water.  For example, we can reclaim land to form  water\r\n\r\ncatchment, explore underground water or desalinate  seawater.\r\n\r\nAt  the same time, we should embark on a nation-wide campaign\r\n\r\nto  conserve  water.   Today,  we  are  still  using  potable\r\n\r\ndrinking water for washing our corridors and watering plants.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can explore innovative\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechniques of water recycling used in many other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I wish to ask the Minister the following\r\n\r\nquestions:  (1) What is the long-term plan to increase  water\r\n\r\nself-sufficiency in Singapore?  Is it possible for  Singapore\r\n\r\nto  be  completely self-sufficient in water one day?  (2)  Is\r\n\r\nwater recycling applicable in Singapore?  What is the cost of\r\n\r\nrecycled  water?  (3) What are the plans to further encourage\r\n\r\nwater conservation among businesses and consumers?\r\n\r\n<br>6.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Madam, as\r\n\r\nwe   move  towards  less  dependency  on  water  supply  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  we  have to look for  a diversity of water  supply\r\n\r\nsources.  At present, half of our water supply depends on our\r\n\r\nrainfall  catchment,  the  other  half  from  the  two  water\r\n\r\nagreements  with Malaysia.  The NEWater project is  promising\r\n\r\nand  could  be  one of the important sources of water  supply\r\n\r\nupon  the  expiry of the first water agreement with Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThe  first,  and it could be the last, seawater  desalination\r\n\r\nplant  will  be  on stream by the year 2005,  supplying  one-seventh of Singapore's water needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, the water agreement with Malaysia is\r\n\r\nhighly uncertain.  We may disagree with the terms due to  the\r\n\r\nprice,  or  the  quality of the water,  because  there  is  a\r\n\r\ngrowing  trend  of water pollution.  We must take  this  time\r\n\r\navailable  now  to find viable alternatives  if  we  fail  to\r\n\r\nextend the water agreement in the future.  What we need to do\r\n\r\nis  to  explore reliable fresh water sources in  the  region,\r\n\r\nlike  Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand and Kalimantan, which\r\n\r\nare  actually not very far away from Singapore.   The  common\r\n\r\nthought  of  lay persons on the high transportation  cost  of\r\n\r\nwater  from  these countries is misleading.  When we  compare\r\n\r\nthe transportation cost with the price of water from brackish\r\n\r\nwater  (RO)  and seawater desalination, it is very affordable\r\n\r\nand very cheap.  Just take an official quotation of US$20,000\r\n\r\nto  charter an oil tanker of 200,000 tonnes from Australia to\r\n\r\nSingapore, it works out to less than\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUS10 cents per cubic metre.  Therefore, this is a viable  way\r\n\r\nof  transporting water from a nearby country in the region to\r\n\r\nSingapore  if  the raw water price charged is reasonable.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to urge the Ministry not to abandon the concept of\r\n\r\nexploring  the shipping of fresh water from the  region.   It\r\n\r\ncould  be one of the very viable means of fresh water  supply\r\n\r\nin  the  future, at least in case of an emergency.   Five-six\r\n\r\ntankers will be sufficient to supply Singapore with one day's\r\n\r\nwater  needs.   I would like to ask the Minister  whether  he\r\n\r\nwould  consider this particular idea of shipping  water  from\r\n\r\nthe nearby countries to Singapore, as one of the alternatives\r\n\r\nfor fresh water supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEWater is one of the very promising areas.\r\n\r\nTechnically, NEWater is much cleaner than normal  water.   If\r\n\r\nwe  take  the Chua Chu Kang Water Treatment Plant, the  water\r\n\r\nquality contains about 350 parts per million in terms of  the\r\n\r\ntotal dissolved salt, whereas the NEWater only contains  less\r\n\r\nthan 50 parts per million.  This is why the NEWater is a very\r\n\r\nattractive water to the wafer fab industry, because it  costs\r\n\r\nthem  much  less  to convert it into ultra-pure  water.   The\r\n\r\nquestion now is:  how do we market the NEWater?  Are we going\r\n\r\nto  charge  a cheap price and make it look like poor  quality\r\n\r\nwater,  or should we market it as a branded product and  only\r\n\r\npeople  who  need  high  quality water  will  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\npurchase  this  water at a high price?  If  we  are  able  to\r\n\r\nmarket  the NEWater in this particular manner, we could  tell\r\n\r\nthe  people  that it is high quality water, and there  is  no\r\n\r\nreason why people would think that it is dirty and refuse  to\r\n\r\nconsume it.  So, I would like to ask the Minister whether  he\r\n\r\nhas  any  plan  to  promote the use of NEWater  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we are talking about a potential ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Low, can you please wrap up your\r\n\r\nspeech?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

In\r\n\r\nsome countries - I am told Orange County in California, USA - water produced or reclaimed, using the same technique used in\r\n\r\nour  NEWater plant, is supplied for domestic consumption.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the quality of our NEWater is  safe  and  is\r\n\r\nvery  good.   So, I want to ask the Minister whether  he  has\r\n\r\nplans to take on this potential supply of NEWater, which is a\r\n\r\nmore  reliable source of water supply, to fulfill  our  water\r\n\r\nrequirements.  If so, when can this happen?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Khor is not in the House. Dr Michael\r\n\r\nLim  is  also  not around.  Mr Iswaran is not  speaking.   Mr\r\n\r\nAhmad Magad.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad:</b> Madam, my topic is also on\r\n\r\nNEWater.   First,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for the Environment had spoken at length last  year\r\n\r\nin  this  House about the potential use of NEWater, and  that\r\n\r\npriority of its use will be for the wafer fab industry, which\r\n\r\ndemands  ultra-pure and very clean water.   However,  in  the\r\n\r\nlight of the changed situation, where the Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid in Parliament recently that we are gradually moving away\r\n\r\nfrom and decreasing our dependence on Malaysia for the supply\r\n\r\nof  water, I would like to know from the Minister what is his\r\n\r\nMinistry's revised plan in domesticating the use of NEWater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, is the NEWater Visitor Centre at Bedok\r\n\r\nready  and open to members of the public?  Beyond its use  in\r\n\r\nindustry,  I  think  there  is a need  to  accelerate  public\r\n\r\neducation  on domesticating the use of NEWater for  the  home\r\n\r\nenvironment, particularly if it is meant for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrinking.  For the many of us who have visited the plant,  we\r\n\r\nare   convinced  that  NEWater  is  clean  and  suitable  for\r\n\r\nconsumption.   But members of the public need  to  understand\r\n\r\nwhat we are doing to purify recycled water, and the resultant\r\n\r\nquality  from  this  process,  so  that  they  too  can  feel\r\n\r\ncomfortable  of  its  cleanliness and suitability  for  human\r\n\r\nconsumption,  if  we  have to move in this  direction  sooner\r\n\r\nrather than later.  Perhaps laying down a time-table for  the\r\n\r\ndomestic use of NEWater would be useful, so that we can adopt\r\n\r\na  phased  approach of its application for both industry,  as\r\n\r\nwell as for domestic consumption.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Madam, it is getting late,\r\n\r\nand I will try to be brief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, Mr Steve Chia spoke about the need to create\r\n\r\nbrilliance  in  our kids in school, and then Mr  Chiam  spoke\r\n\r\nabout Sweden and Nobel prize winners, but I am afraid I  will\r\n\r\nbe talking about bottom-lines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's plan to dig deep for our bottom-line\r\n\r\nsewerage  needs says a lot about our Government's  foresight.\r\n\r\nThey  not only think far, but also deep.  As the saying goes,\r\n\r\n\"we  leave  no stone, or is it earth, unturned.\"   For  land-scarce Singapore, we have understood the need to go skywards.\r\n\r\nWe know why we need to reach for the sky, while our feet must\r\n\r\nfirmly be on the ground, and now even going underground.   We\r\n\r\nare  also  going  seawards,  with reclamation,  but  that  is\r\n\r\nanother story.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new area of sewerage development is all the more\r\n\r\ncritical, as we are now turning to NEWater, as mentioned by a\r\n\r\nfew  Members earlier on, as an alternative source  of  water.\r\n\r\nSo  these deep tunnel sewerage projects are going to be  very\r\n\r\nimportant for our NEWater project too.  We are not only land-scarce  but water-scarce, and thus Singaporeans must be  made\r\n\r\nconscious of the importance of the deep tunnel projects.  Can\r\n\r\nthe  Minister share with us Environment Ministry's  plans  to\r\n\r\ninform  the  public  about the importance  of  the  projects?\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  these  projects, deep they  may  be,  are  not\r\n\r\ncheap.  Can the Minister explain what are the cost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimplications for our water and utilities charges in the  long\r\n\r\nterm?   Also,  will the Minister look into other needs  which\r\n\r\ncould  be  synergised with the building of the deep  tunnels?\r\n\r\nIt is well known in Singapore that one digging always follows\r\n\r\nanother  when it comes to utilities work, leaving  the  roads\r\n\r\nmessy  and traffic inconvenienced.  So with the deep tunnels,\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity comes once, and thus must be used for  other\r\n\r\nneeds,  eg,  if there are other needs to be met in  terms  of\r\n\r\nelectricity  or  other  utilities.  Madam,  the  deep  tunnel\r\n\r\nsewerage project is innovative, and I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\nnot be cursive and shallow in his answer to my questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Madam, I am speaking on the\r\n\r\nrecycling of waste.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People may be aware of the fire outbreaks at companies\r\n\r\ncollecting  wood  wastes.  These cases happened  in  Lim  Chu\r\n\r\nKang,  and also the recent case in Tuas.  It took a few  days\r\n\r\nfor the Fire Department to put out the fire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection of wood wastes without the need to\r\n\r\nrecycle is a very lucrative business.  For every ton of  wood\r\n\r\nwastes, they charge more than $40.  Some waste collectors dig\r\n\r\na  big  hole in the ground and they try to bury as much waste\r\n\r\nas possible in a limited collector's site.  Some of them also\r\n\r\npile  up  all  the wood wastes to the height of  a  mountain.\r\n\r\nToday,  after  the fire in Lim Chu Kang, the  black  hill  is\r\n\r\nstill  standing high and is an eyesore object.  This  reminds\r\n\r\npeople  of  the misuse of the waste collection for recycling.\r\n\r\nSuch  potential  fire  hazards due to wood  waste  stockpiles\r\n\r\nstill  exist in Lim Chu Kang, Sungei Kadut Industrial Estate,\r\n\r\nand also in Tuas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether there is a plan\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the recycling company is genuinely  carrying\r\n\r\nout recycle work.  If their products do not have a market, or\r\n\r\nthe market is smaller than what they can recycle, they should\r\n\r\nbe  honest  and stop collecting the wastes.  They should  let\r\n\r\nthe  incinerator take over the wastes, instead of piling them\r\n\r\nup,  and  waiting for a time when the fire would solve  their\r\n\r\nproblem.  It will endanger the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlives of the people and also endanger the properties near the\r\n\r\nstockpile  area.  It will also cause air and water pollution,\r\n\r\nif such uncontrolled fire incidents take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry should look into the matter and see whether\r\n\r\nthe  recycling  companies  are  genuine,  and  whether  their\r\n\r\nstockpiles are beyond the capacity of what they can  recycle.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister should also take tough punitive actions against\r\n\r\nanyone  who does not comply with the original conditions  for\r\n\r\nthe setting up of a wood recycling company.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now the Minister\r\n\r\nmentioned that we have been progressing well in the recycling\r\n\r\nof waste materials, but this is only for paper and plastics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a garden city. Over the years, many, many\r\n\r\ntrees have been planted all over the island.  A lot has  been\r\n\r\ndone to keep these trees in good shape and good health.   The\r\n\r\nNational  Parks Board carries out maintenance work  on  these\r\n\r\ntrees, by pruning them every now and then.  In the process, a\r\n\r\nlot of branches are being cut off everyday.  Can the Minister\r\n\r\nenlighten  us  as  to  whether  these  cut  branches  can  be\r\n\r\nrecycled?  If so, have they been recycled?  I understand that\r\n\r\na  certain company has been recycling the husks of durian  to\r\n\r\nproduce flower pots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For recycling to be successful in Singapore, we need the\r\n\r\nsupport  of the grassroots organisations and the people,  and\r\n\r\nwe should step up the education campaign in recycling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also promised some rebates on our\r\n\r\ngarbage disposal fees, if a certain percentage of our  wastes\r\n\r\ncould  be  recycled.  With the advancement in  technology,  I\r\n\r\nwould  imagine  that  more of our waste  materials  could  be\r\n\r\nrecycled,  and  hence  our garbage  disposal  fees  could  be\r\n\r\nlowered.   But  instead we find that the fees are  increased.\r\n\r\nCan  the  Minister  tell  us how much  more  we  must  do  in\r\n\r\nrecycling in order to claim the said rebates?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Madam, in the midst of the current\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn, another increase that would  add  to  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  living  has been announced.  The  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  announced the increase in the  fees  for  refuse\r\n\r\ndisposal.    The  increase  was  passed  on  to   households,\r\n\r\nshopkeepers, shopowners, market and stallholders  immediately\r\n\r\nby  the  waste  collection company.   The  Ministry,  in  its\r\n\r\nannouncement, also stated that by raising the refuse disposal\r\n\r\nfees  to  the  actual  cost recovery  level,  will  encourage\r\n\r\nrecycling, something which is very funny to me.  I would like\r\n\r\nto know:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whether it is the Ministry's intention to\r\n\r\neventually pass on the full cost of refuse disposal  fees  to\r\n\r\nthe  households.   If so, will the increases  ultimately  add\r\n\r\nburden to the average household?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What efforts has the Ministry made to encourage\r\n\r\nrecycling,   in  the  context  of  keeping  waste  collection\r\n\r\ncompany's  fees  down?   They  did  not  pass  the  cost   to\r\n\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) I understand the Minister said that the target for\r\n\r\nrecycling  is  60%. Is this 60% going to be achieved  by  his\r\n\r\nMinistry's increase in refuse disposal fees?  That  was  what\r\n\r\nhe said in the statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Recently, the refuse\r\n\r\ndisposal  fee was increased by about 15% for private housing.\r\n\r\nSo,  I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.  First\r\n\r\nof  all,  why is there a need to increase the refuse disposal\r\n\r\nfee  by  15%?  Is it not better to increase the fee when  the\r\n\r\neconomy  improves in future?  The other question  is  whether\r\n\r\nthe  refuse collector is over-charging.  Because the increase\r\n\r\nin incinerator fees may not necessarily be transferred to the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  fees  for  refuse collection.   So,  could  the\r\n\r\nMinister respond to my question, whether the refuse collector\r\n\r\nis actually over-charging?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof Low, do you want to move on to your\r\n\r\nnext cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.
