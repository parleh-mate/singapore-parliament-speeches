When  and  how\r\n\r\nnationalisation  of  the  bus  companies  will  be\r\n\r\nbrought  about must depend on the ability  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  meet  the  financial  problem   of\r\n\r\ncompensating the bus companies.

With men of vision and  good\r\n\r\nsense  on  the Board of Management, it is possible\r\n\r\nfor  such  a school to achieve a higher degree  of\r\n\r\nefficiency. On the other hand, it is not  uncommon\r\n\r\nfor  a Board of Management with good intention but\r\n\r\nlittle  knowledge of education to  interfere  with\r\n\r\nthe  staffing  and the educational policy  of  the\r\n\r\nschool   to  such  an  extent  that  progress   is\r\n\r\nseriously hampered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The   Review  Committee  clearly  indicated   that\r\n\r\nsomething   is   basically  wrong   with   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  The  ideals of the  founders  of  the\r\n\r\nNanyang University were admirable. They set out to\r\n\r\nestablish  a  University to meet  the  demand  for\r\n\r\nhigher  education  for students from  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nsecondary  stream  at  a time  when  the  colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment  failed  to  do anything.  However,  in\r\n\r\nmoving towards their goal, the founders, who  have\r\n\r\nbecome  the  Management Committee, were confronted\r\n\r\nwith  university  problems which their  commercial\r\n\r\nand trading\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexperience could not provide the answers, to.  Had\r\n\r\nthe  previous Government been realistic  in  their\r\n\r\napproach to problems, they should have immediately\r\n\r\nwarned   Nanyang   University,  soon   after   its\r\n\r\nestablishment, of the dangers arising out  of  the\r\n\r\ncontrol of the University by businessmen, who  are\r\n\r\nwithout  the  experience of dealing  with  matters\r\n\r\nconcerning  higher education. This  misfortune  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University would not  have  reached  such\r\n\r\nproportions  today  had  the  previous  Government\r\n\r\nacted in a more responsible manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Nanyang University Ordinance came into\r\n\r\nbeing, Nanyang University was organised and run on\r\n\r\nthe   basis  of  a  limited  company.  The   major\r\n\r\npreoccupation of the Management Committee was  how\r\n\r\nto  run  the University without too big an  annual\r\n\r\ndeficit.  No  doubt  some  $20  million  had  been\r\n\r\npromised  to the University, but out of  this  sum\r\n\r\nonly   $13  million  is  reported  to  have   been\r\n\r\nsubscribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its four years of existence, Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity suffered many setbacks, but  none  more\r\n\r\ncrippling  than  the lack of expert  planning  and\r\n\r\nadvice. A group of shrewd businessmen started  the\r\n\r\nUniversity with a great deal of initiative, but  a\r\n\r\nuniversity  is  an organisation for  learning  and\r\n\r\nresearch  and  not  a  business  enterprise.   The\r\n\r\nattitude  which  goes  to make  for  a  successful\r\n\r\nbusiness   enterprise  is  not   necessarily   the\r\n\r\nattitude  required  for administering  a  seat  of\r\n\r\nlearning.  In a university, a line must  be  drawn\r\n\r\nbetween  general policy and academic  policy,  and\r\n\r\nthe latter should be left in the hands of academic\r\n\r\npersonnel.  In  Nanyang  University,  the  curious\r\n\r\nsituation  had arisen where the Secretary-General,\r\n\r\nwho    has    no    acquaintance   of   university\r\n\r\nadministration,  found  himself  on  all  academic\r\n\r\ncommittees  and also one of the three  members  of\r\n\r\nthe Final Examinations Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new university could not possibly achieve both\r\n\r\nquality  and  quantity in a short space  of  time.\r\n\r\nPerhaps   out   of  consideration  for   financial\r\n\r\nstability,  quality  has been  sacrificed  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of quantity. Further, there appears to be\r\n\r\nno proper evaluation of the individual\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteacher's  qualifications  and  merit.  From   the\r\n\r\nReview  Committee's Report, it  appears  that  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum of Nanyang University shows a  lack  of\r\n\r\nsystematic planning and proper co-ordination,  and\r\n\r\nindividual guidance from staff members appears  to\r\n\r\nbe lacking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the Singapore Government's stand on\r\n\r\nNanyang University in view of the findings of  the\r\n\r\nGwee   Ah  Leng  Review  Committee?  Despite   the\r\n\r\ncritical   findings  contained   in   the   Review\r\n\r\nCommittee's  Report, the Singapore Government  has\r\n\r\ndecided to employ Nanyang University graduates and\r\n\r\nto  recognise  the Nanyang University  degrees  as\r\n\r\nequivalent   to  Pass  Degrees  of  a   recognised\r\n\r\nuniversity.  Selection  will,  as  usual,  be   on\r\n\r\nindividual merits through interview by the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission. But in the  public  interest,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government will have to  reconsider\r\n\r\nthe  position  if the next graduation examinations\r\n\r\nare conducted in this lackadaisical manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next important question is, in what manner\r\n\r\nand  under  what  conditions  will  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment   be   prepared  to   support   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the People's Action Party Government's\r\n\r\neducation  policy is based on parity of  treatment\r\n\r\nfor the four streams of education in Singapore, it\r\n\r\nfollows  that the new Government will be  prepared\r\n\r\nto support Nanyang University on the same basis as\r\n\r\nit  does  the University of Malaya, provided  that\r\n\r\nthere are similar safeguards as to the maintenance\r\n\r\nof proper academic standards and proper accounting\r\n\r\nof public monies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Review Committee has recommended certain\r\n\r\nreorganisational changes which, if effected, would\r\n\r\nresult  in  the  following  budget  deficits   for\r\n\r\nNanyang University and which they recommend should\r\n\r\nbe  met by Government, namely, $606,570 for  1960,\r\n\r\n$675,302 for 1961, and $745,034 for 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government has no hesitation in\r\n\r\naccepting  its  share of these deficits,  for  the\r\n\r\nSingapore students in Nanyang University  who  are\r\n\r\nestimated  at  40  per cent of the  total  student\r\n\r\npopulation.

Since\r\n\r\nthe   proportion  of  Singapore  students  at  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Malaya was agreed at one-third  and\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds  for  the  Federation,  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  has agreed to subsidise the University\r\n\r\nof  Malaya  to  the  extent of one-third  of  $9.2\r\n\r\nmillion,  or $3.06 million, which sum was approved\r\n\r\nunder  sub-head  60 in the 1960  Education  budget\r\n\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we use the same \"per capita\" cost formula for\r\n\r\nNanyang  University basing on  1959  enrolment  of\r\n\r\n1,700  students as the basis for 1960 as well,  we\r\n\r\narrive  at  a  deficit  of $5.286  million.  Since\r\n\r\navailable facts would indicate that 40 per cent of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University students are  from  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government is prepared to subsidise\r\n\r\n40  per  cent  of $5.286 million, or  the  sum  of\r\n\r\n$2.115 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is the duty of the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  only to subsidise its own students  at\r\n\r\nNanyang  University, we are however prepared,  for\r\n\r\nthe time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeing,  to shoulder a greater financial burden  in\r\n\r\norder  that  Federation students  now  in  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  may  be  allowed  to  complete   their\r\n\r\nstudies with the same advantages and facilities as\r\n\r\nSingapore students and at the same cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be stated, however, that this proposed\r\n\r\nannual  grant  is  in  addition  to  the  $600,000\r\n\r\nalready  approved under sub-head 54 of the  recent\r\n\r\nbudget for Bursaries and Scholarships for Nan-yang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  But, before any grant  can  be  made,\r\n\r\nGovernment  must be assured that government  funds\r\n\r\nare  well  spent and properly accounted  for,  and\r\n\r\nthat  proper standards in regard to academic staff\r\n\r\nand the teaching are maintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point worthy of mention, at this juncture,\r\n\r\nis  the fact that the last Government paid the sum\r\n\r\nof  $385,896  on  6th May, 1959,  to  the  Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  authorities  to  meet  their  supposed\r\n\r\ndeficit  for  1958. Payment was made  \"subject  to\r\n\r\nproduction   of  audited  accounts  as   soon   as\r\n\r\npossible\", on the basis of a Statement of  Account\r\n\r\nrendered  by  the Chairman and Hon.  Treasurer  of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University Council on 13th  April,  1959,\r\n\r\nshowing  a deficit of $450,000 out of a budget  of\r\n\r\n$1.4 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to state that after three reminders for\r\n\r\nthe  1958 audited accounts, the last of which  was\r\n\r\non  23rd January, 1960, the audited accounts  were\r\n\r\nreceived by the Ministry of Education only a  week\r\n\r\nago, on 2nd February, 1960, and is now the subject\r\n\r\nof    study.   Any   properly   organised   public\r\n\r\ninstitution  working  on  a  budget  of  under  $1\u00bd\r\n\r\nmillion per annum should be able to render audited\r\n\r\naccounts  within three months. The fact  that  the\r\n\r\nNanyang  University authorities  had  to  take  13\r\n\r\nmonths  to submit audited accounts is a matter  of\r\n\r\nconcern to the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University must therefore be\r\n\r\nreorganised,  academic standards must  be  raised,\r\n\r\nand  the general policy of Nanyang University must\r\n\r\nbe  entrusted  to  a  group of  people  with  high\r\n\r\nacademic  reputation and experience  to  discharge\r\n\r\nsuch  onerous duties, and adequate checks made  on\r\n\r\nexpenditure and accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Singapore Government is alone in\r\n\r\nshouldering  the  financial  burden   of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity,  Nanyang University will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nreorganised  to  serve  the  needs  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore  the present policy regarding intake  of\r\n\r\nstudents  from outside Singapore will have  to  be\r\n\r\nrevised. After all, it is the responsibility of  a\r\n\r\nState to provide education for the children of its\r\n\r\nown  citizens  and taxpayers, first and  foremost.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Singapore Government will be prepared\r\n\r\nto  subsidise non-Singapore students to a total of\r\n\r\n15  per  cent of the student population in Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity. The common practice in other countries\r\n\r\nis  to  have less than 5 per cent of the  students\r\n\r\nfrom  outside  their territories. Reorganisational\r\n\r\nrestrictions, when introduced, will be  applicable\r\n\r\nto new entrants only.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With full Singapore Government support for\r\n\r\nNanyang  University,  it is  envisaged  that  even\r\n\r\nthose  who  fail  to  obtain  bursaries  from  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government will not find it  impossible\r\n\r\nto  benefit from further studies, should  lack  of\r\n\r\nfinance  be  the  chief obstacle. Therefore,  full\r\n\r\nSingapore    Government   support   for    Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity will result in more students  from  the\r\n\r\npoorer classes benefiting from higher education at\r\n\r\nNanyang  University,  than has  been  possible  at\r\n\r\npresent.  Higher  education  should  not  be   the\r\n\r\npreserve of only those who can afford to pay  high\r\n\r\nfees,  but  should be thrown open to  as  many  as\r\n\r\npossible  who have the mental capacity to  undergo\r\n\r\nhigher  studies,  so that more  graduates  can  be\r\n\r\nturned  out  to  make  their maximum  contribution\r\n\r\ntowards the betterment of society in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government accepts, in principle,\r\n\r\nthe main recommendations contained in the Gwee  Ah\r\n\r\nLeng   Review   Committee's  Report   on   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity.  As stated earlier, we are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nprepared    to   go   even   further   than    the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  in  applying  the  principle   of\r\n\r\nparity of treatment to Nanyang University together\r\n\r\nwith  the  financial  implications  thereof.   The\r\n\r\nquestion  is,  whether to patch  and  tinker  with\r\n\r\nNanyang  or really to resolve the basic  problems.\r\n\r\nWe will not shirk our responsibility of supporting\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly  the  reorganisation   of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  to back it with adequate finance, when it  is\r\n\r\nin  the  interest of the people and the  cause  of\r\n\r\neducation  in  Singapore so to  do.  To  the  many\r\n\r\nbenefactors who have so generously contributed  to\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang University endowment fund, Government\r\n\r\nappeals for their continued support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government, on its part, has\r\n\r\ndecided  to take all the steps necessary  to  make\r\n\r\nthe  Nanyang University a real university and,  to\r\n\r\nthis end, would be prepared to spend as much money\r\n\r\non the Nanyang University as it is spending on the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Malaya, on the basis of  parity  of\r\n\r\ntreatment.  At the same time, in the  interest  of\r\n\r\nhigher   education  in  Singapore,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment will see that positive steps  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken   to  ensure  closer  co-operation   between\r\n\r\nNanyang  University and the Singapore Division  of\r\n\r\nthe University of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as we expect the Singapore Division of the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Malaya, which was  established  to\r\n\r\nmeet the needs of higher education for the English\r\n\r\nstream,  to open its doors to those emerging  from\r\n\r\nthe  non-English  secondary streams,  so  in  like\r\n\r\nmanner  Nanyang University, which was  established\r\n\r\nto  meet  the  needs of higher education  for  the\r\n\r\nChinese   stream,  should  develop  in  a  similar\r\n\r\nfashion  to  absorb  the products  from  the  non-Chinese   secondary   streams.   The   media    of\r\n\r\ninstruction in the two universities will remain as\r\n\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years now, the people of Singapore have\r\n\r\nbeen   wondering  what  will  become  of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity  and  its future destiny.  The  present\r\n\r\ndecision  of the Singapore Government will  settle\r\n\r\ntheir doubt. With reorganisation, students will be\r\n\r\nassured of a future and parents can also plan  the\r\n\r\ncareers of their sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the members of the management Committee of\r\n\r\nNanyang  University,  we say  that  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  welcome  the  holding  of  early\r\n\r\ndiscussions  on the implementation of this  policy\r\n\r\nstatement  prior  to  reorganisation  of   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity as recommended\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby the Gwee Ah Leng Review Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest is an appendix to the statement, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister can table the\r\n\r\nAppendix.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* see cols. 217-8.\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1960/19600210/19600210-HA-0120217.pdf\"\">REPORT OF NANYANG UNIVERSITY REVIEW COMMITTEE(Cols 0217-0218)</a><br>\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Yes, thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If there is any hon.

In Committee I shall move certain  amendments  which will not affect the general features of the scheme\r\n\r\nembodied  in this Bill. These are the encouragement\r\n\r\nof  collective bargaining with a view to  the  free\r\n\r\nnegotiation  of  collective agreements  on  matters\r\n\r\naffecting  the  relations  between  employers   and\r\n\r\nemployees,   conciliation   to   assist   in    the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  and,  as far as possible,  to  remove\r\n\r\ndeadlocks   in   the  negotiations,  and   finally,\r\n\r\narbitration where agreement cannot be reached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer first to collective\r\n\r\nbargaining,  because  I wish to  lay  the  greatest\r\n\r\npossible  emphasis  upon the importance  that  this\r\n\r\nGovernment attaches to the bargaining provisions of\r\n\r\nthis Bill. The Government believes in the value  of\r\n\r\nfreely   negotiated  industrial   agreements   and,\r\n\r\nindeed, I venture to say that few will deny that an\r\n\r\nagreement  is  the best method whereby  in  a  free\r\n\r\nsociety  the relations between people or groups  of\r\n\r\npeople  can  be  regulated.  The  proposition  that\r\n\r\npeople  ought  to observe their agreements  is  one\r\n\r\nwhich commands universal acceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, conciliation has proved valuable\r\n\r\nin  the  past  and we propose that the services  of\r\n\r\nspecially   trained  conciliation  officers   shall\r\n\r\ncontinue to be available where this can help  those\r\n\r\nendeavouring  to reach agreement.  In  relation  to\r\n\r\nthis  aspect  of the Bill, I would point  out  that\r\n\r\nprovision has been made to ensure that negotiations\r\n\r\ninitiated, as provided in the Bill, are not  unduly\r\n\r\nprolonged;  that  collective  agreements  shall  be\r\n\r\nenforceable in the same way as arbitral awards; and\r\n\r\nthat  where negotiations break down or where  there\r\n\r\nis  a  refusal  to  negotiate,  there  is  a  means\r\n\r\nprovided  whereby  disputes  may  be  resolved   by\r\n\r\narbitrable awards. This, Sir, I emphasise,  is  the\r\n\r\nway  in  which  the arbitral provisions  should  be\r\n\r\nviewed.  One often hears collective bargaining  and\r\n\r\narbitration  spoken  of as if  they  were  mutually\r\n\r\nexclusive alternatives. This, Sir, is not  so,  and\r\n\r\nwe  are providing a system which allows for the co-existence of agreements and awards. If matters work\r\n\r\nout  in the way that we hope and expect, agreements\r\n\r\nwill  be  the rule and awards we hope will  be  the\r\n\r\nvery rare exception. Fears have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen expressed that the court will, soon after its\r\n\r\nestablishment,  be faced with  a  volume  of  work\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be beyond its capacity to dispose  of\r\n\r\nexpeditiously. I hope that this will not prove  to\r\n\r\nbe  the  case, but one of the amendments  which  I\r\n\r\nshall  move  at a later stage will be designed  to\r\n\r\nenable  this position to be controlled  should  it\r\n\r\narise.   I  hope,  however,  that  it  will   not.\r\n\r\nCompulsory    arbitration,    unlike    collective\r\n\r\nbargaining  and conciliation, is I  admit  new  to\r\n\r\nSingapore   and   I   can  well   understand   any\r\n\r\nreservations  about it, and indeed any  opposition\r\n\r\nto  it  that  may be expressed. On the  employers'\r\n\r\nside,  it  invades, for example, their liberty  to\r\n\r\nengage  labour at the rates established in a  free\r\n\r\nmarket,  that is, it may force them  to  pay  more\r\n\r\nthan  they  would  otherwise  have  to  pay.   And\r\n\r\nequally, on  the  employees'  side,  it   implies\r\n\r\nlimitation  on the right to use direct  action  to\r\n\r\nobtain the limit of what can be obtained by  trial\r\n\r\nof  strength, that is, awards must be accepted. On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, there are correlative advantages\r\n\r\nto  both  sides. Awards are a great  safeguard  to\r\n\r\nemployees   particularly  in  times  of   economic\r\n\r\nadversity, and from the employers' point of  view,\r\n\r\nthere  is  the  assurance that the  system  offers\r\n\r\ncontinuity  of  work and stability  in  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps the most important consideration is\r\n\r\nthis.  Strikes and lockouts and other  traditional\r\n\r\nforms   of  direct  action  cause  suffering   and\r\n\r\nhardship to those involved, and economic  loss  to\r\n\r\nthe  community  as  a whole on  a  scale  which  a\r\n\r\nprogressive society, aiming at a happier life  and\r\n\r\nhigher economic standards for all, cannot tolerate\r\n\r\nand  cannot afford. I ask all of those who dislike\r\n\r\nthe  element  of judicial regulation  involved  in\r\n\r\ncompulsory arbitration to view the matter  in  the\r\n\r\nlight o those considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we are setting out to do is to\r\n\r\nsubstitute  the  rule of law for the  law  of  the\r\n\r\njungle  in industrial relations, to establish,  in\r\n\r\nthe words of the first president of the Australian\r\n\r\nArbitration Tribunal, \"a new province for law  and\r\n\r\norder\". But I repeat, Sir, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrule  of  law never means that one side  can  have\r\n\r\neverything  its own way. A system of  law  implies\r\n\r\nrights  and  obligations  and  there  can  be   no\r\n\r\nenjoyment of the rights without observance of  the\r\n\r\nobligations.  What we want to see is  the  general\r\n\r\nobservance  and  acceptance  of  the  awards   and\r\n\r\nagreements by both sides. But, Sir, it will depend\r\n\r\non  the  spirit in which employees and  employers,\r\n\r\nand  particularly  their organisations  and  their\r\n\r\nleaders,   approach   the   new   system:    their\r\n\r\nwillingness  to  meet round the bargaining  table,\r\n\r\nand  their  preparedness to place their respective\r\n\r\npoints  of view fairly before the court if matters\r\n\r\ngo  to arbitration. I appeal to all, who desire to\r\n\r\nsee   the   establishment   and   maintenance   of\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace, to approach  the  scheme  in  a\r\n\r\nspirit conducive to the achievement of those  good\r\n\r\nresults  which I am confident it can yield.  As  I\r\n\r\nhave already said, I know that certain features of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  will arouse dislikes and even fears  in\r\n\r\nsome   quarters;   fears  that  powers   will   be\r\n\r\nexercised,  for  example, sc as to impose  ruinous\r\n\r\nobligations on employers or savage penalties  upon\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  of employees. I ask those  who  may\r\n\r\nthink in that way to believe that experience  will\r\n\r\nshow that such disasters will not materialise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court is, of course, tripartite in character.\r\n\r\nThere will be members nominated by each side drawn\r\n\r\nfrom  panels constituted by the Minister.  But  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  president on whom, if  the  members\r\n\r\ndiffer,  the final decision will rest. It  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  our intention to appoint a man  who  will\r\n\r\nhave   a  full  sense  of  the  high  duties   and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  of  his  office  and  who   will\r\n\r\ndischarge  his functions in a judicial spirit  and\r\n\r\nwith due regard to all the factors relevant to and\r\n\r\nthe  interests  affected by the decisions  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be suggested that the president being, as\r\n\r\nhe  will be, an impartial person may, in the  very\r\n\r\nnature  of  things,  have neither  a  trade  union\r\n\r\nbackground such as to enable him to appreciate the\r\n\r\nfeelings and aspirations of the workers,  nor  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  experience which will  enable  him  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the problems of management. But  it  is\r\n\r\nfor this reason\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namong  others that we have provided that  the  two\r\n\r\nmembers  who  will  join  with  the  president  in\r\n\r\nconstituting the court will be drawn  from  panels\r\n\r\nconstituted  from  among  the  nominees   of   the\r\n\r\nemployers'   and   employees'  organisations.   In\r\n\r\nselecting  members from the panels for  particular\r\n\r\ncases,  the  parties' preferences  will  be  given\r\n\r\neffect to. The members will be members in the full\r\n\r\nsense, not representatives of the disputants, much\r\n\r\nless  advocates for them. Their membership  should\r\n\r\nensure  that no aspect of a case is overlooked  or\r\n\r\nnot fully appreciated when the court comes to make\r\n\r\nits decision. With regard to the representation of\r\n\r\nthe parties in proceedings before the court, it is\r\n\r\nour  belief that this is a function which is  best\r\n\r\nperformed by officers of trade unions. We have not\r\n\r\nlimited  it  strictly to officers,  as  clause  62\r\n\r\nshows. I shall move certain amendments at a  later\r\n\r\nstage  with  the object of making the clause  less\r\n\r\nrestrictive,   because   it   is   realised   that\r\n\r\nparticularly in the early stages of the  operation\r\n\r\nof the Ordinance some unions may not have officers\r\n\r\nequipped  to do this work effectively.  But  in  a\r\n\r\nscheme  such as this, the representation of  union\r\n\r\nmembers  in  negotiations  and  before  the  Court\r\n\r\nshould come to be regarded as the normal function,\r\n\r\nindeed  one of the principal functions of a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  leader.  He has a part to play  within  the\r\n\r\nsystem  and  it  offers him a new  field  for  the\r\n\r\nexercise  of  his  talents  and  for  serving  his\r\n\r\nmembers with credit to himself. This, Sir, is  the\r\n\r\nconsideration  which has led us  to  provide  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  not be representation by an  advocate\r\n\r\nand   solicitor  in  arbitral  proceedings.   This\r\n\r\nprovision is not intended as any reflection on the\r\n\r\nlegal profession. Indeed we know that if the  Bill\r\n\r\npermitted it, professional representation would be\r\n\r\nvery frequently availed of. One difficulty relates\r\n\r\nto  a matter always close to a lawyer's heart,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Farrer Park very well knows,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  the question of costs; and the  workers'\r\n\r\norganisations  could  be in real  difficulties  if\r\n\r\nthey  were confronted by Counsel on the other side\r\n\r\nas  they have not the resources to pay for similar\r\n\r\nrepresentation.  This, however, is  not  the  main\r\n\r\nreason why the Bill\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproposes  as  it does. It is desired to  encourage\r\n\r\nunion officials particularly on the workers'  side\r\n\r\nto  handle  their union affairs. On the employers'\r\n\r\nside,  the  larger  employers already  include  on\r\n\r\ntheir  staff  officers  who  are  specialists   in\r\n\r\nindustrial relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it must be pointed out that\r\n\r\nproceedings   before   the   Court   relating   to\r\n\r\nindustrial  matters are not judicial  proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe  judicial  function is the  ascertainment  and\r\n\r\nenforcement of rights under the law. The  arbitral\r\n\r\nfunction  involves the determination of  what  the\r\n\r\nrights  and  duties are to be in the  future.  The\r\n\r\narbitrator's role is closer to that of the parties\r\n\r\nwhen  they negotiate an agreement than that  of  a\r\n\r\njudge  when he decides the matter litigated before\r\n\r\nhim.  Indeed,  if there is an analogy,  it  is  to\r\n\r\ndelegated legislation. When this is realised,  the\r\n\r\nexclusion of professional representation assumes a\r\n\r\ndifferent   aspect.  Likewise,  the  question   of\r\n\r\nappeals.  It  will be noted that an award  is  not\r\n\r\nsubject   to   review  except  by  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court itself upon an application  for\r\n\r\nvariation.  If  there were to be  a  review,  this\r\n\r\nwould not be a function of a court of law for  the\r\n\r\nreason that I have just explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have referred to fears that may exist that the\r\n\r\nCourt  may, through  inexperience,  do  something\r\n\r\nwhich  could involve us all in economic  disaster.\r\n\r\nThe Court is empowered by clause 32 to have regard\r\n\r\nto  the  interest of the community as a whole  and\r\n\r\nthe  condition  of the economy of the  State.  The\r\n\r\nCourt  includes members who will be aware of these\r\n\r\nconsiderations. Strong advocacy in the Court  will\r\n\r\nensure that such considerations are put before the\r\n\r\nCourt.   The  Court  is  empowered  to  vary   its\r\n\r\ndecisions  where sufficiently strong  reasons  are\r\n\r\nadvanced. Finally, the President will, as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  be  a responsible man chosen with the  full\r\n\r\nrealisation  of  the importance of  the  Court  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to the economy. As the system  develops.\r\n\r\nit could be that we may have to have more than one\r\n\r\nCourt  to deal with matters in the first instance.\r\n\r\nIf that happened, the question of an appeal system\r\n\r\nwould arise, but any appeal would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnaturally be to another arbitral body and  not  to\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary courts. However, all that is for the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has received the very careful\r\n\r\nconsideration of myself and all my colleagues.  We\r\n\r\nhave  had the benefit of advice and experience  in\r\n\r\nthe  planning  and  in  the  drafting  stage  from\r\n\r\nAustralia, where industrial arbitration  has  been\r\n\r\nin  operation for over sixty years. But we do  not\r\n\r\nclaim  that  the Bill is perfect  and  we  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the Ordinance will operate  for  any\r\n\r\ngreat  length of time without amendments. We will,\r\n\r\nof  course, watch its operation most carefully and\r\n\r\nI draw the attention of this Assembly to clause 87\r\n\r\nunder  which the President is required  to  report\r\n\r\nannually to the Government on the working  of  the\r\n\r\narbitration system. In this, we have followed  the\r\n\r\nAustralian law where a similar provision  provides\r\n\r\na  regular opportunity to review the operation  of\r\n\r\nthe  system. I assure this House that we will give\r\n\r\nvery careful consideration to these reports and to\r\n\r\nrepresentations  made  to  us,  and  we  will  not\r\n\r\nhesitate to introduce amending legislation if  the\r\n\r\nneed to do so is shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have also decided to leave\r\n\r\nthe  Services  and  their  employees  out  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill. This is because our State\r\n\r\nis fully self-governing in internal affairs but is\r\n\r\nnot a sovereign State as far as external relations\r\n\r\nand  internal  security are  concerned.  For  that\r\n\r\nreason,  we are in no position to pass  any  local\r\n\r\nlegislation  binding on Her Majesty's  Government.\r\n\r\nThat  being  so,  we consider  that  it  would  be\r\n\r\nadvisable  to leave it to the Services  and  their\r\n\r\nemployees to decide whether they would freely wish\r\n\r\nto  avail  themselves  of the  machinery  we  have\r\n\r\nprovided  in  this  Bill  for  the  settlement  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  disputes, and it would be up  to  them\r\n\r\ntherefore to decide whether they would freely come\r\n\r\nin  or keep out altogether. In this connection,  I\r\n\r\nhave   been   advised   by  the   United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nCommissioner  in  Singapore, with  whom  both  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  and I have had discussions,  that\r\n\r\nthe United Kingdom departments are not opposed  in\r\n\r\nprinciple to the objects of the Bill, since indeed\r\n\r\narbitration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourts  have  for  long been a normal  feature  of\r\n\r\ncivil  service negotiating machinery in the United\r\n\r\nKingdom.  I have also been informed by the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom  Commission here that the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\ndepartments  could  not,  however,  agree  to  the\r\n\r\nBill's  application without modification to  cover\r\n\r\ncertain  aspects  which  are  governed  by  United\r\n\r\nKingdom statute or practice and are not within the\r\n\r\ndirect  competence of the United  Kingdom  Service\r\n\r\ndepartments functioning in Singapore. I hope  that\r\n\r\nit  will  be possible in the near future  for  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom Service departments  to  reach  an\r\n\r\nagreement  with their employees on the application\r\n\r\nof the Bill on such terms as may be agreed between\r\n\r\nthem,  and, if such agreement is not possible,  to\r\n\r\nsettle their problems by other amicable means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to the\r\n\r\nAssembly and I do move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Minister has given us reasons why he considers\r\n\r\nsuch a Bill is necessary at the present time,  and\r\n\r\nwhile  we do not disagree with him on some of  the\r\n\r\nreasons,  we  do feel that certain  provisions  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill go far beyond what is required. I  will\r\n\r\ntherefore go through this Bill and point  out  the\r\n\r\nvarious clauses where I feel that amendments  have\r\n\r\nto  be made in order to make it more effective  or\r\n\r\nless reprehensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, towards the end of his speech, the Minister\r\n\r\ntells  us why it has been necessary that employees\r\n\r\nin  Service  departments have to be excluded  from\r\n\r\nthe operation of this Bill, but that if they, of\r\n\r\ntheir own accord, desire to enjoy the operation of\r\n\r\nthis Bill they may do so. It therefore means, Sir,\r\n\r\nif  I  read the definition of \"employee\" correctly\r\n\r\nin  page  2 of the Bill, that officers or servants\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Government are for the purposes\r\n\r\nof this Ordinance \"employees\". If that is so, Sir,\r\n\r\nthen the definition of \"employer\" will have to  be\r\n\r\namended   because  the  definition  of  \"employer\"\r\n\r\nrestricts  the  class or classes  of  officers  or\r\n\r\nservants  in the employment of the Government.

I might remind the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill that we are on the Second Reading of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill and I trust that he will not go into the\r\n\r\ndetails  of his amendments or the details  of  the\r\n\r\nclauses,  because paragraph (2) of Standing  Order\r\n\r\n67 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On the order for the second reading of a Bill\r\n\r\nbeing read, a motion may be made \"That the Bill be\r\n\r\nnow  read  a second time\", and a debate may  arise\r\n\r\ncovering the general merits and principle  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There have been several notices of amendments sent\r\n\r\nin, and I trust that the Member for Cairnhill will\r\n\r\nbe  patient  and  wait until the  Committee  stage\r\n\r\nbefore commenting in detail on the clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I understand that, but this is in relation to\r\n\r\nthe   principle  whether  all  employees  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment are employees for the purposes of  this\r\n\r\nOrdinance and I am a little puzzled as to  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are or they are not. If they are, then  well\r\n\r\nand  good:  if they are not, then I have something\r\n\r\nto say on principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see that one of the most important clauses\r\n\r\nin  this  Bill  is  clause 62. The  Minister  gave\r\n\r\nreasons why trade unions should not be represented\r\n\r\nby  an advocate and solicitor. While I agree  with\r\n\r\nhim  on those reasons, I cannot help but say that,\r\n\r\nprevious to the tabling of this Bill, trade unions\r\n\r\nhave   found  it  not  only  desirable  but   also\r\n\r\neffective  that they should be represented  by  an\r\n\r\nadvocate and solicitor who knows what is going  on\r\n\r\nin the trade union field and who is, shall we say,\r\n\r\nau fait with almost all labour legislation to help\r\n\r\nthem  in  arguing  conciliation cases  or  in  the\r\n\r\ncourts.  It  seems,  Sir,  that  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nleaders  of  the  P.A.P. who  are  advocates  and\r\n\r\nsolicitors as well now feel that such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  thing  should not be allowed because, in  their\r\n\r\nview, the trade union leaders themselves are quite\r\n\r\ncapable of carrying out their functions in arguing\r\n\r\na  case  in the Arbitration Court. Sir, I  do  see\r\n\r\nthat  in  denying  a  trade  union  the  right  of\r\n\r\nemploying  an  advocate and solicitor  to  present\r\n\r\ntheir  case  in  court  the employer  is  also  so\r\n\r\nbarred,  but  then,  as the Minister  himself  has\r\n\r\nsaid,   most  employers  have  employed  personnel\r\n\r\nmanagers  who are well trained and are specialists\r\n\r\nin  their  jobs. But I do not think that the  same\r\n\r\ncan  be said of all the trade unions in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  are  some  officers  of  trade  unions,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  who  are  quite capable  of  representing\r\n\r\ntheir unions. But there are many - many more - who are\r\n\r\nnot in that position. Therefore, I feel, Sir, that\r\n\r\nfor  the  present,  as  the Minister  himself  has\r\n\r\nindicated  that this law has to be tried  out  and\r\n\r\namendments may be found necessary, that until  all\r\n\r\nthe  trade union officers have enough training  to\r\n\r\nrepresent   their  unions  on   their   own,   the\r\n\r\nassistance   of  an  advocate  and  solicitor   in\r\n\r\nrepresenting the case of trade unions  before  the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court should be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am wondering whether the Minister, because\r\n\r\nhe  has  said  that he has several  amendments  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  during  the Committee stage  in  order  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  the Bill, would agree  to  refer  this\r\n\r\nBill to a Select Committee. If he does, then there\r\n\r\nis no need for a lengthy debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one is not so clear in regard to Part III,\r\n\r\nparticularly  clauses 18 and 20. According  to  my\r\n\r\nreading  of these two clauses in relation to  this\r\n\r\nPart of the Bill, when the Commissioner for Labour\r\n\r\nhimself  is  notified by a trade union of  workmen\r\n\r\nthat  it  has submitted a request to the  employer\r\n\r\nfor  negotiations, he must notify the Minister but\r\n\r\nhe  cannot  notify  the Registrar  of  the  Court,\r\n\r\nunless the Minister so directs. We can understand,\r\n\r\nSir,  why  that clause is necessary,  because  the\r\n\r\nMinister  feels that he may consider it  necessary\r\n\r\nthat  a further attempt at conciliation under  his\r\n\r\nchairmanship or under the chairmanship of somebody\r\n\r\nappointed  by  him may help to resolve  the  trade\r\n\r\ndispute.  But there is nothing, Sir, in this  Part\r\n\r\nof this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill  to  say  that  if such  an  attempt  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  resulted in failure,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nshall  direct  the  Commissioner  to  notify   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of the Court. One can say  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimplied in those words, but I feel that it has  to\r\n\r\nbe  inserted into the clause in order to  make  it\r\n\r\nabundantly  clear  that  if  any  attempt  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister   to   bring  about   a   settlement   by\r\n\r\nconciliation   results  in   failure,   then   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  shall  be  directed  to  notify  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24, Sir, is rather complicated. This\r\n\r\nclause   brings  in  the  question  of   a   union\r\n\r\nsubmitting a notice to more than one employer,  or\r\n\r\nmore  than  one union sending in a  notice  for  a\r\n\r\ncollective  agreement to one employer. The  clause\r\n\r\nis  a bit puzzling. It brings in the question that\r\n\r\nunless  all the employers or all the trade  unions\r\n\r\nhave  reached  agreement,  the  matter  should  be\r\n\r\nreferred to the Commissioner for Labour.  I  think\r\n\r\nit  would be desirable, if one trade union has  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  three notices to three separate employers,\r\n\r\nand  if  agreement  has been reached  between  the\r\n\r\ntrade  union  and  one employer, that  the  matter\r\n\r\nshould be taken out of this clause. But if  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  so, whether or not agreement has been reached\r\n\r\nbetween  a trade union and one employer, all  that\r\n\r\nmust be reported to the Commissioner for Labour. I\r\n\r\nthink that clause requires amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see, Sir, that in regard to the President of\r\n\r\nthe Court, he shall be appointed on the advice  of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister. But in regard to the  Acting\r\n\r\nPresident,  who  is to have the  same  duties  and\r\n\r\nfunctions  of the President, he is to be appointed\r\n\r\non the advice of the Minister for Labour. I do not\r\n\r\nsee  why  it  should  be  necessary  to  have  two\r\n\r\nappointing bodies. If it is going to be the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, why not make him the appointing body for\r\n\r\nboth appointees? Or the Minister for both?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the qualifications of a member of\r\n\r\nthe  Panel. I feel that anyone who is a  Committee\r\n\r\nmember  of  any  political party  or  any  of  its\r\n\r\nbranches  should be disqualified from  serving  on\r\n\r\nthe  Panel. The Minister has said that the members\r\n\r\non  the  Panel  are not there to  look  after  any\r\n\r\nparticular interest - that I accept. They are  there\r\n\r\nwith an open\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmind  to  try  and understand the problems  before\r\n\r\nthem  and to consider them in the light of  clause\r\n\r\n32,  whether or not it is in the economic interest\r\n\r\nof  the  country  that any improvements  in  their\r\n\r\nwages  and  salaries should be made. I  feel  that\r\n\r\nCommittee members of political parties should  not\r\n\r\nbe on this Panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have learnt during my few years of service\r\n\r\nin  this  House that the power to appoint  carries\r\n\r\nwith  it the power to remove. But I see in  clause\r\n\r\n9,  the  removal  of a person from  the  Panel  in\r\n\r\ncertain  instances by the Minister, and  in  other\r\n\r\ninstances by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (obviously\r\n\r\non  the  advice of the Minister). Surely, Sir,  if\r\n\r\nremoval  is necessary of any member of the  Panel,\r\n\r\nthe Minister should have that power to remove such\r\n\r\nmembers.  He need not have to advise the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to remove anybody who, according to\r\n\r\nsub-clause (2) of clause 9, has become permanently\r\n\r\nincapable of discharging his functions. Surely  if\r\n\r\nhe   has   become  \"permanently  incapable\",   the\r\n\r\nMinister  can say. \"Well, sorry. You cannot  serve\r\n\r\nbecause  you are permanently incapable.\" There  is\r\n\r\nno  need  to  ask  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  to\r\n\r\ndeclare   that,  because  a  member   has   become\r\n\r\npermanently  incapable, he  cannot  serve  on  the\r\n\r\nPanel.  But I think why the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nhas  been  brought into this matter  to  remove  a\r\n\r\nmember  of the Panel is because of sub-clause  (2)\r\n\r\n(b):  that  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is  of  the\r\n\r\nopinion  that that member is not a fit and  proper\r\n\r\nperson  to  be selected to constitute  the  Court.\r\n\r\nSir,  before  any  nominee  of  the  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress or any nominee of the employer's side  is\r\n\r\nappointed  by the Minister to serve on the  Panel,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, under clause 6 sub-clause (6), must\r\n\r\nbe  of  the opinion that that person is a fit  and\r\n\r\nproper  person. If he is a fit and  proper  person\r\n\r\nbefore his appointment how can he become not a fit\r\n\r\nand  proper person after his appointment? It could\r\n\r\nonly lead to speculation that such a case can only\r\n\r\narise  if that member on the Panel does not  carry\r\n\r\nout  his duties to the wishes or to the liking  of\r\n\r\nthe government of the day. I do not think that  is\r\n\r\nso. I do not believe that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  so.  Therefore, I would suggest,  \"Let  us\r\n\r\ncarry  on  with the normal way of legislating - that\r\n\r\nthe  power to appoint will carry with it the power\r\n\r\nto remove.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to clause 23, Sir, in the case of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  which have reached  agreement  with\r\n\r\ntheir employers, they must prepare a memorandum of\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of  agreement and  submit  it  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of the Court. But there is  nowhere  in\r\n\r\nthis clause which says that it can be submitted in\r\n\r\neither  of  the four languages of Singapore - Malay,\r\n\r\nEnglish, Chinese or Tamil. But in another  clause,\r\n\r\nclause 45 (2), the Registrar shall cause copies to\r\n\r\nbe  made in these four languages. I am sure,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  it  is just an oversight, and it is not  the\r\n\r\nintention  of the Minister that the memorandum  of\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of agreement reached between  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion and the employer must be in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 31 is, I think, going a bit too\r\n\r\nfar - giving   unnecessary   protection    to    the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Clause 31 says that before a matter or\r\n\r\na  trade  dispute  between the  Government  as  an\r\n\r\nemployer and its employees can be arbitrated upon,\r\n\r\nthe President must get the sanction of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. But the matter cannot come  before\r\n\r\nthe  Court;  the Court cannot have cognizance  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a trade dispute unless the two parties, i.e.\r\n\r\nGovernment  on the one side and its  employees  on\r\n\r\nthe  other, both agree to refer the matter to  the\r\n\r\nCourt,   or   where  the  Minister   directs   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Labour that such a trade  dispute\r\n\r\nshould  be notified. Once the Commissioner has  so\r\n\r\nnotified  the  Court  through the  Registrar  that\r\n\r\nthere is a trade dispute between the Government as\r\n\r\nan  employer and its employees, surely,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nCourt  should  go  ahead without  getting  another\r\n\r\n\"green  light\", shall we say, from  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure is, I understand, that if a trade\r\n\r\nunion and an employer cannot reach an agreement in\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  then  the Commissioner  for  Labour\r\n\r\nwill have a try. He will ask conciliation officers\r\n\r\nto  bring  the  two  parties together  to  try  to\r\n\r\nconciliate  to reach agreement. If  he  fails,  he\r\n\r\nwill then tell the Minister, \"I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfailed.\" The Minister, again, can under clause  21\r\n\r\nsay,  \"All right. I think there should be  further\r\n\r\nconciliation.\" He steps in, either with he himself\r\n\r\nas  the chairman or somebody appointed by him. And\r\n\r\nthen if he finds that he has failed, he says, \"All\r\n\r\nright.  Refer  to the Court.\" Then  the  President\r\n\r\nwill  have another try. Sir, this is dragging  the\r\n\r\nmatter  unnecessarily. The  Commissioner  has  one\r\n\r\ntry, the Minister for Labour has one try, and when\r\n\r\nit  reaches  the Court, I think the  Court  should\r\n\r\nstraightaway  sit and arbitrate  on  the  dispute,\r\n\r\ninstead of having a further try. As we know,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  longer a dispute is left to exist,  the  more\r\n\r\nheart-aches there will be between disputants. So I\r\n\r\nfeel  that,  once the Commissioner for Labour  has\r\n\r\nhad his trial, and the Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nhas had his second trial, the President should not\r\n\r\nbe  given  the power to say that there  should  be\r\n\r\nanother  trial.  I feel that the Court  should  go\r\n\r\nstraight ahead arbitrating on the trade dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read in the Press that the Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress  have called a meeting of its constituent\r\n\r\nmembers  to seek their views on this Bill,  but  I\r\n\r\nhave  not  read in the Press any more whether  the\r\n\r\nTrades Union Congress have made representations to\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   or  whether  the   Minister   has\r\n\r\nconsidered such representations, and that  in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of  such representations, he  is  going  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  amendments during the Committee  Stage  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that this is a very important Bill. It\r\n\r\nis  a  Bill  designed  to bring  about  industrial\r\n\r\npeace. Everyone wants that. We know that in  1956,\r\n\r\n1957 and 1958, because there was no such Bill  and\r\n\r\nbecause there were no restrictions on trade unions\r\n\r\non  strikes,  there had been a lot  of  industrial\r\n\r\nunrest.  The  Government may be profiting  by  the\r\n\r\nexperience of their own sins in the past  and  may\r\n\r\nnow  have  realised  that to  foster  strikes  and\r\n\r\nencourage   trade  unions  to  go  to  the   limit\r\n\r\nirrespective of the economy of the country is  all\r\n\r\nwrong,  and that such things should not be allowed\r\n\r\nto take place again. And I even find, under clause\r\n\r\n83,  that  an officer of a trade union  cannot  go\r\n\r\ninto a place of work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto talk about trade union matters. I think it is a\r\n\r\ngood thing. But then I cannot help but say that it\r\n\r\nwas  because of an officer of a trade union  being\r\n\r\nrefused  by  an employer to go into the  place  of\r\n\r\nwork  to talk to members of a trade union on trade\r\n\r\nunion matters that the union called a strike,  and\r\n\r\nthat  particular union had for its  legal  adviser\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. the  Prime  Minister.  Maybe  they  are\r\n\r\nlearning their mistakes, or learning the folly  of\r\n\r\ntheir  ways,  and  they think that  such  a  thing\r\n\r\nshould  not be repeated. I am with them.  I  think\r\n\r\nthey are right now and that they were wrong in the\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this clause 37, sub-clause (2)\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- it is a bit difficult to understand why it is\r\n\r\nnecessary. Now, it is right that there  should  be\r\n\r\nprotection  to ensure that the employer  does  not\r\n\r\nget  out  of  an  award by just  transferring  his\r\n\r\nbusiness to somebody else. If an employer  employs\r\n\r\na  devious  method of getting out of an award,  he\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  allowed to do so. That  I  agree,\r\n\r\nunder clause 37 (1) (d), that is, any successor or\r\n\r\nany  assignee or transmittee shall be bound by the\r\n\r\naward. But I cannot understand the purpose of sub-clause (2) of clause 37. What it means is this, if\r\n\r\nI  have read it right. If A starts a business  at,\r\n\r\nsay,  No.  51 Neil Road, and then later  he  finds\r\n\r\nthat  he cannot carry on any longer and he  closes\r\n\r\nthe  shop.  Then another man starts a business  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  address  and  does  the  same  kind  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.  Even though he may have  no  connection\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  with  A, he is to  be  bound  by  this\r\n\r\naward - just  because he happens to  find  that  the\r\n\r\npremises  are  suitable for his business.  He  may\r\n\r\nhave his own set of employees. He may have removed\r\n\r\nhis  business  from a different  address  to  this\r\n\r\naddress - to  No.  51 Neil Road,  for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\nargument. Is it intended that he should  be  bound\r\n\r\nby  the award - he, who has no connection whatsoever\r\n\r\nwith the previous employer who was a party to this\r\n\r\naward?  I  think  it  is wrong  to  encourage  the\r\n\r\npremises to be left vacant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do feel, Sir, that this Bill should be\r\n\r\nreferred to a Select Committee, and I am sure that\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  and  employers alike  will  greatly\r\n\r\nwelcome  the opportunity to submit representations\r\n\r\nto this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  in  order  to  make  this  very\r\n\r\nimportant labour legislation a welcome one by  all\r\n\r\nsides.

Such was the fate of  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement in the past. The labour  movement\r\n\r\nwas  designed to create unity so that the  workers\r\n\r\ncould  earn a living for their families and  their\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill, Mr Speaker, is to help\r\n\r\nthe  labour  movement.

When this Bill was\r\n\r\nfirst  introduced into this Assembly,  the  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress and 16 unionists read  through  it\r\n\r\nvery  carefully, and afterwards submitted  certain\r\n\r\namendments to the Minister for Labour and Law.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same  time, the Federation of  Employers  and\r\n\r\nother  employers  also went into  this  Bill  very\r\n\r\nthoroughly,   and   they   submitted   a   20-page\r\n\r\nmemorandum to the Minister for Labour and Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade union side read this Bill through very\r\n\r\ncarefully.  We  had the opportunity  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law. In fact, we discussed\r\n\r\nthe  Bill clause by clause, and also discussed the\r\n\r\namendments  which  will  be  introduced   at   the\r\n\r\nCommittee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main aim of this Bill is to stabilise the\r\n\r\nrelations between employer and employee in a  more\r\n\r\npractical  way  with regard to trade  disputes  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This Bill, in fact, is in line with our\r\n\r\nParty's  policy which we put before the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore during the elections. And, of course, we\r\n\r\nthen  mentioned  categorically that  our  aim  was\r\n\r\nindustrial peace with justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was hearing the speech of the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill,  I  thought he was  going  to  make  an\r\n\r\noutburst  against this Bill. In fact, he  had  not\r\n\r\nmuch to say. He just took clause 50. When the  Minister made his speech earlier, he had\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaid  that  he  would make certain  amendments  to\r\n\r\nclause  50,  and therefore clause 50  is  no  more\r\n\r\nvalid.  Even if he makes capital out  of  it,  the\r\n\r\ntrade   unionists  cannot  carry  on  their  union\r\n\r\nactivities  in  their  working  place.

But we  are  quite\r\n\r\nproud of the way in which the Minister dealt  with\r\n\r\nlabour  disputes  during the  last  six  or  seven\r\n\r\nmonths  as  compared with the  way  in  which  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill, when he was  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare, dealt with  labour  disputes\r\n\r\nduring his four and a half years of office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unions in their day-to-day dealings with the\r\n\r\nemployers usually meet two categories of employers\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  One  is the unscrupulous  type  of\r\n\r\nemployers,  and when the P.A.P. took  office  they\r\n\r\nquite  understood  the P.A.P.'s  policy - industrial\r\n\r\npeace  with  justice. The behaviour of  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions   for   the  last  six  months   has   been\r\n\r\ncreditable.  I  should like to say here  that  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions,  as a whole, stick to  the  Party's\r\n\r\npolicy  and they behave quite responsibly in  that\r\n\r\nrespect.  But  the employers, on the  other  hand,\r\n\r\ntook  advantage of the situation. They  said  that\r\n\r\nsince   the   P.A.P.   Government's   policy   was\r\n\r\nindustrial peace with justice, they would make use\r\n\r\nof   the  fact,  thinking  that  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  would one day or other go  against  this\r\n\r\nGovernment and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreate  industrial disturbances in  Singapore.  To\r\n\r\ndeal  with this situation, therefore, we must have\r\n\r\nsome kind of legislation to pin down this type  of\r\n\r\nemployers, and that is the main reason why we, the\r\n\r\ntrade unions, support this Bill in principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is going to move an amendment in clause 28, and when this amendment is made, most\r\n\r\nof  the fears of the trade unions will be removed.\r\n\r\nClause  28  deals  with  the  question  when  both\r\n\r\nparties jointly request arbitration. Paragraph (b)\r\n\r\nof  clause  28  will be deleted when the  Minister\r\n\r\nmoves  his amendment. Why I say the trade  unions'\r\n\r\nfears will be partly removed is this. There  is  a\r\n\r\ntime  lapse when negotiation fails and  the  court\r\n\r\ntakes  cognizance of the trade dispute; and during\r\n\r\nthis  period  the trade unions are at  liberty  to\r\n\r\ntake  industrial  action against their  employers.\r\n\r\nBut the important point is this - that the court  is\r\n\r\nonly going to take cognizance of the trade dispute\r\n\r\nafter  the Minister informs the court. Of  course,\r\n\r\nwe  agree  in  principle that when the  matter  is\r\n\r\nreferred   to  the  court  there  should   be   no\r\n\r\nindustrial action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again in this Bill, if any collective\r\n\r\nagreement is reached between both parties and that\r\n\r\nagreement is registered with the court, it has the\r\n\r\neffect of an award. In the situation in Singapore,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  find  in most cases that when  employers\r\n\r\nnegotiate  with  employees  and  reach  a  certain\r\n\r\nagreement, and when the time comes for them to put\r\n\r\ntheir  signature on the agreement,  the  employers\r\n\r\njust  say, \"No, we are not going to sign  it.\"  So\r\n\r\nmany  of  these cases are happening, even  in  the\r\n\r\nLabour Ministry. A union submitted a claim.  Their\r\n\r\nemployers  negotiated with  them  and  reached  an\r\n\r\nagreement.  But  when  the  time  came   for   the\r\n\r\nemployers to put their signature on the' agreement\r\n\r\nand  make  it  valid,  the union  found  that  the\r\n\r\nemployers just flatly refused to sign and were not\r\n\r\ngoing to adhere to what they had agreed during the\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  At the present moment,  in  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation, either the unions will have to call for\r\n\r\nindustrial action or go to the Ministry of  Labour\r\n\r\nand Law. And if they go to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Labour and Law on  the  existing\r\n\r\nrules   and  regulations,  the  Minister  or   his\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  or  anybody  cannot   do\r\n\r\nanything, because the law is such and they  cannot\r\n\r\ngo  beyond  the law. But when this Bill is  passed\r\n\r\nand an agreement is reached, it is notified to the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of the Court and the Registrar  will  in\r\n\r\nturn  inform  the  President  who  will  sign  the\r\n\r\nagreement, and that agreement will be valid for l\u00bd\r\n\r\nyears or 2 years or 3 years, or whatever period is\r\n\r\nagreed between the union and the employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important fact is this. We find that there\r\n\r\nare  people who take an active part in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement  for their selfish  interest.  The\r\n\r\nemployers  know the situation well and easily  buy\r\n\r\nthese people over with prize appointments, so that\r\n\r\nthey  will become black-legs or traitors to  their\r\n\r\nunion;  and  when  the union submits  demands  and\r\n\r\nsomething  is achieved, these people are benefited\r\n\r\nboth ways:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Being traitors to the union, they will get\r\n\r\nprize appointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) When the union makes an agreement with the\r\n\r\nemployers, they will get the same benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>But  one  important fact to strengthen  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement is this. So far, when a trade union\r\n\r\nputs up a demand and an agreement is signed, or it\r\n\r\ngoes  to  arbitration and an award is  made,  that\r\n\r\naward  is only applicable to members of that trade\r\n\r\nunion.  That  is  now going to be amended  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  That one clause is very  important  for\r\n\r\nthe  growth  of a healthy trade union movement  in\r\n\r\nthis  country. Knowing that position, no employees\r\n\r\ncan  loyally work for an employer, or be  traitors\r\n\r\nto  the union. If they do, then the union is in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  say  that these  employees  are  not\r\n\r\neligible  for that award for which the  union  has\r\n\r\nfought so hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the amendments which are going to\r\n\r\nbe  introduced by the Minister, I think, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the trade unions in Singapore will  be\r\n\r\nhappy about this Bill. For the last six months\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  trade unions have shown a considerable amount\r\n\r\nof   responsibility  and  cooperation   with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  At  the same time, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law and the whole of his Ministry  have\r\n\r\ntried  their level best to bring about  industrial\r\n\r\npeace  with justice. The trade union movement  has\r\n\r\ncomplete confidence in the present Government, and\r\n\r\nespecially in the Ministry of Labour and  Law,  in\r\n\r\nseeing  that this Bill, when it is passed and  put\r\n\r\ninto  operation,  will surely  benefit  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement as a whole, and any fears among the\r\n\r\ntrade  union  movement, if  there  are  any,  will\r\n\r\neasily be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this Bill which we have before the House  is\r\n\r\nan  important piece of legislation and we must pay\r\n\r\ntribute to the Minister for Labour and Law who has\r\n\r\ndone  so  much during these last eight months  for\r\n\r\nthe  labour movement. We know that since  he  took\r\n\r\noffice  in  June  last year he has  fulfilled  the\r\n\r\npromise  of  getting a Trade Union House  for  the\r\n\r\nlabour movement. He has also introduced a Bill  to\r\n\r\neliminate yellow and splinter unions so  that  the\r\n\r\nlabour movement could be strengthened and be in  a\r\n\r\nbetter   position  to  bargain  collectively   and\r\n\r\nachieve better things from the employers.  And  we\r\n\r\nknow that his Ministry has also been seeing to  it\r\n\r\nthat  the  legislation which has been in force  is\r\n\r\nbeing carried out. No one can deny that during the\r\n\r\nless  than nine months since the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhas been in control, there have been confidence in\r\n\r\nthe Government and industrial stability. This Bill\r\n\r\nseeks   to  promote  stability  so  that   capital\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  industrial  expansion  could  be\r\n\r\ncarried   out.   We  all  know  of   the   growing\r\n\r\nunemployment  in Singapore. We all know  that,  to\r\n\r\nsurvive, we have to industrialise; and we all know\r\n\r\nthat  no  one  will invest money unless  there  is\r\n\r\nstability.   This   piece  of   legislation   will\r\n\r\nencourage  such capital development and industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion. At the same time, this Bill  will  also\r\n\r\nensure that the worker gets his fair share of  the\r\n\r\nfruits of his labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.

I am\r\n\r\nglad he has realised that the introduction of this\r\n\r\nBill will be good for the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.29 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  would be very interesting to speculate on what\r\n\r\nwould   have  happened  had  such  a   Bill   been\r\n\r\nintroduced three or four years earlier. I  venture\r\n\r\nto  suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if  this  Bill\r\n\r\nhad  been in force four years ago, quite a lot  of\r\n\r\nthe  Members  sitting opposite me might  not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  in  this  Assembly. However, these  are  all\r\n\r\nmatters  of  speculation. Any one's guess  may  be\r\n\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing is that we are here this\r\n\r\nafternoon to debate the principle involved in this\r\n\r\nBill.  Speaking for myself and for Members in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  I think it is a good Bill.  It  is  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  attempt  by the Government  to  hold  the\r\n\r\nbalance  equally  between  the  employer  and  the\r\n\r\nemployee in the interests of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems to be the principle underlying this\r\n\r\nBill'.   It  is  a  principle  accepted   by   the\r\n\r\nOpposition, and if anyone says it should have been\r\n\r\nimplemented earlier he may be right or he may  not\r\n\r\nbe  right.  It may be that four or five years  ago\r\n\r\nthe  time was not opportune. Perhaps this  is  the\r\n\r\ngolden moment when it should be introduced and the\r\n\r\ngolden moment is in the hands of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour and Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in seeking to bring- about\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace  and good relationships  between\r\n\r\nemployees  and  employers, a principle  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted in the past is being departed  from\r\n\r\nand  a  new principle is being introduced.  It  is\r\n\r\nimportant  not only to the employees but  also  to\r\n\r\nthe  employers that this Bill should be a success,\r\n\r\nbecause it is vital to the survival of the  State.\r\n\r\nSo  I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that all aspects of\r\n\r\nthis Bill should be very carefully considered. The\r\n\r\nHon. the Minister for Labour and Law himself said\r\n\r\nthat he and his Government\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  given this Bill a great deal of thought  even\r\n\r\nbefore they put it down as Bill No. 61. Apparently\r\n\r\non  this matter, the Government was assisted by an\r\n\r\nAustralian expert loaned to them by the Australian\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But at this late stage this  morning,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, the Minister  has  filed  very\r\n\r\nimportant  amendments which, to my mind,  somewhat\r\n\r\ndisturb the original balance held in the Bill. The\r\n\r\namendments  to  be moved are important.  The  Bill\r\n\r\nitself   is   sufficiently  important,   but   all\r\n\r\ninterested  opinion  on  this  matter  should   be\r\n\r\nconsulted  before a new system whereby  industrial\r\n\r\npeace  may  be  achieved is to be  implemented.  I\r\n\r\nwould  therefore ask the Minister for  Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw  to consent to this Bill being referred  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee in order that that end might  be\r\n\r\nachieved. But if the Minister feels that he  would\r\n\r\nnot  permit it to go to a Select Committee,  could\r\n\r\nhe  consider deferring the Committee stage of this\r\n\r\nBill  in  order  that further  and  more  adequate\r\n\r\nrepresentation be made to him before final  action\r\n\r\nis  taken  by the Assembly? The Minister  himself,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, did not indicate to  the  House\r\n\r\nwhat  representations had been made to him, either\r\n\r\nby  employers  or employees, but  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah, who seems to be very well-informed\r\n\r\nin  these  matters, made so bold as  to  say  that\r\n\r\nrepresentations had been made. But in  so  far  as\r\n\r\nthe Minister himself is concerned, he has not made\r\n\r\nany  statement  to  the House  as  to  what  those\r\n\r\nrepresentations were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Bill\r\n\r\nbecause  it  contains  provisions  whereby   small\r\n\r\nunions  can  be  given the opportunity  to  derive\r\n\r\nbenefits  as  a  result of negotiations  with  big\r\n\r\nemployers.  With the existence of this Bill,  such\r\n\r\nunions can fight in the interest of their members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague the Member for Telok Blangah has\r\n\r\npointed  out  just  now, only  employees  who  are\r\n\r\nmembers  of  unions  will stand  to  benefit  from\r\n\r\nagreements signed with their employers. This is  a\r\n\r\nmatter which employees should be proud\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof,   because   hitherto  all  employees   derived\r\n\r\nbenefits  as  a  result  of  negotiations  between\r\n\r\nemployers and trade unions, despite the fact  that\r\n\r\nsome  of  them were non-members of the unions.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that  such people are obstructionists.  They\r\n\r\nhinder  a healthy labour movement. When this  Bill\r\n\r\nis  enacted, these opportunists will no longer  be\r\n\r\nable  to  derive  benefits from agreements  signed\r\n\r\nwith their employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Cairnhill stated that\r\n\r\nunder  this  Bill,  if, for instance,  a  business\r\n\r\nconcern  at No. 51 Neil Road, came to an agreement\r\n\r\nwith  its employees and it became bankrupt  months\r\n\r\nlater,  its successor would have to abide  by  the\r\n\r\nagreement  reached earlier. It  was  the  practice\r\n\r\nduring the past Government for a business concern,\r\n\r\nafter   having  reached  an  agreement  with   its\r\n\r\nemployees, to wind up its business on the  pretext\r\n\r\nof  bankruptcy. Then a few months later, this firm\r\n\r\nwould establish itself under a different name  and\r\n\r\nunder  a different management board; but the  fact\r\n\r\nis that the same persons managed the new firm. The\r\n\r\nreason  for  that  is that they  wished  to  avoid\r\n\r\npaying the benefits to their employees. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwith  the  existence of this Bill, I am sure  that\r\n\r\nthe  employers who had been encouraged by the past\r\n\r\nGovernment to indulge in such malpractices will no\r\n\r\nlonger  be  able to get an opportunity to  oppress\r\n\r\ntheir employees in such a manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park said just now that if\r\n\r\nthis Bill had been enacted four or five years  ago\r\n\r\nthose trade union leaders who are now on this side\r\n\r\nof  the House would surely not be here today.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like to explain the stand of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unionists  who are  in  this  Assembly\r\n\r\ntoday. Their stand is different from that taken by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Farrer Park. In the last election,\r\n\r\nhe  stood as an Independent candidate, but when he\r\n\r\nwas  returned, he became an S.P.A. member. But the\r\n\r\nstand  of the trade unionists on this side of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  has never wavered. There is no doubt  that,\r\n\r\nin  spite of the fact that some of them are on the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side,  they  will  still  continue  to\r\n\r\nstruggle in the interest of the workers,  as  they\r\n\r\nhave  done previously. We do not switch our  stand\r\n\r\nfrom one side to another. Why I say this,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, is because when this  Bill  was\r\n\r\nread  the  First time, we trade unionists  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side  and other trade  unionists  were\r\n\r\ninvited to attend a conference to discuss the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  is before us today clause by clause.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult, several amendments were put forward by the\r\n\r\ntrade unionists. Therefore, we trade unionists  on\r\n\r\nthis side of the House fully support this Bill  to\r\n\r\nwhich  several amendments will be moved  later  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr   Speaker,   Sir,  although   the   Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Bill which is being introduced  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Labour and Law has not  reached  the\r\n\r\nideal  stage,  I  do think, however,  that  it  is\r\n\r\npractical,  for the reason that it will substitute\r\n\r\nthe  legislation of the previous Government  which\r\n\r\nhas   taken  an  irresponsible  attitude   towards\r\n\r\nindustrial relations in this country. This Bill is\r\n\r\nan   attempt  to  amend  the  legislation  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  irresponsible  Government  and   it   is\r\n\r\npractical  in the interest of the masses  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people have the power to\r\n\r\nrun  their own affairs. Therefore, the people  who\r\n\r\nhold this power must be represented by themselves.\r\n\r\nAn  important  fact arises out of  this  important\r\n\r\npiece of legislation. Those who are interested  in\r\n\r\nthe trade union movement believe that the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Labour and Law has the final say. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this Bill has not been drafted in a  day  or\r\n\r\ntwo.  It  has been drafted after the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour has put in much effort, energy and time  in\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with  members of  trade  unions,  and\r\n\r\nafter  agreement has been reached on many  matters\r\n\r\nin  this  Bill. Because this Bill has been amended\r\n\r\nin  many  respects, we can see for ourselves  that\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.  Government  is  different  from  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government. Our policy is based  on  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the masses of the people.  Their  views\r\n\r\nmust  be  respected  and given preference  to  and\r\n\r\nshould be embodied in Government legislation. When\r\n\r\nthat happens, we accept them and amend the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when going through the Bill,\r\n\r\nwe   found   a  clause  in  relation  to  disputes\r\n\r\nsubmitted  by the Minister for Labour and  Law  to\r\n\r\nthe Arbitration Court. The previous Government was\r\n\r\ncunning.  They  used  to  cheat  and  deceive  the\r\n\r\nbrothers and sisters of the workers. They used  to\r\n\r\nrefer  disputes to the Arbitration Court. We  know\r\n\r\nthat  the previous Arbitration Court was  a  fake.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in this sense, such a Court could  only\r\n\r\nrepresent a one-sided view. On the other hand, the\r\n\r\nviews  of  the other side were totally  overlooked\r\n\r\nand neglected. But our Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nhas  adopted a different attitude. If any  dispute\r\n\r\narises, and if our Minister thinks that it can  be\r\n\r\nreferred to the Arbitration Court, then he has the\r\n\r\npower  to submit it to the ruling and findings  of\r\n\r\nthe Court. If the dispute between the employer and\r\n\r\nthe  employee  can  be solved by conciliation,  he\r\n\r\nwill then leave it to the conciliation officers to\r\n\r\ndecide. This attitude is very practical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember in the past I\r\n\r\nrepresented   the   Singapore   Telephone    Board\r\n\r\nEmployees' Union in negotiations. When the workers\r\n\r\nsubmitted  their terms to the employer,  they  got\r\n\r\ntheir  victory. Many of the workers did  not  join\r\n\r\nthe union, but they gave full support to the union\r\n\r\nin  their  negotiations with their employer.  Thus\r\n\r\nthose who did not join the union also enjoyed  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  fought for by the union for the members.\r\n\r\nThis  fact  was  unique  under  the  rule  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  government. From this we  can  obviously\r\n\r\nsee  for  ourselves  that there were  unreasonable\r\n\r\nthings  in  society. The employers would blackmail\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union movement; they would  discourage\r\n\r\nworkers  to  join trade unions. We could  see  for\r\n\r\nourselves many workers sitting on the fence.  They\r\n\r\ndid  not  join  the trade unions, but  waited  for\r\n\r\nothers  to  fight for them. There is now provision\r\n\r\nin the present Bill to provide that any member who\r\n\r\ndoes  not  join a union in negotiations  with  the\r\n\r\nemployer  will  not  be  entitled  to  enjoy   the\r\n\r\nbenefits  fought for by the union for its members.\r\n\r\nThis   provision  will  enable  the   workers   to\r\n\r\nunderstand that it is essential for them to join a\r\n\r\nunion.  It  is in their interest to join  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion.   This   provision  fully  represents   the\r\n\r\ninterests of the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus when the Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nintroduces this Bill, I think it is practical for\r\n\r\nthe reasons I have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker. Sir, when this Bill was debated just\r\n\r\nnow, the Opposition Members - the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark,  the  Member for Cairnhill, and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  the  Southern  Islands - put  forward  various\r\n\r\namendments and views. I would like to say, as has\r\n\r\nalso  been  said by my colleagues just now,  that\r\n\r\nbefore   this   Bill  was  debated   today,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  received  representations   from\r\n\r\nseveral  trade unions in Singapore, and  that  we\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists had got together  and  discussed\r\n\r\nits  pros and cons and reached a certain  measure\r\n\r\nof agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill not only protects\r\n\r\nthe workers but also ensures industrial stability\r\n\r\nand  peace.  Under the previous government,  when\r\n\r\nthey  enacted  a  Bill, it  often  appeared  good\r\n\r\noutwardly,  but  in effect it did  not  give  the\r\n\r\nworkers anything concrete. What I have just said,\r\n\r\nperhaps  the  Opposition Members themselves  will\r\n\r\nunderstand,  for  they  know  what  happened   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the  past.  We  had  strikes   and\r\n\r\nlockouts.   The   outdated  Ordinance   was   not\r\n\r\neffective  and  had  no  provisions  as  are  now\r\n\r\nembodied in this Bill. After this Government  had\r\n\r\nassumed office for a few months, I myself,  as  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union leader, had negotiated with  several\r\n\r\nemployers for better conditions of service,  such\r\n\r\nas  overtime pay, involving sums amounting to not\r\n\r\njust  hundreds of dollars but many  thousands  of\r\n\r\ndollars, which the employers were obliged to pay.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  result of the present Government's\r\n\r\ngenuine  intention to better the economic  status\r\n\r\nof  the workers. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir,  by\r\n\r\nthis  Industrial Relations Bill, as I  have  said\r\n\r\nearlier, not only will it protect the workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  but  it  will also  ensure  industrial\r\n\r\npeace.   Therefore,  as  regards  some   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members, they should  be  ashamed  of\r\n\r\nthemselves for what they had failed to do in  the\r\n\r\npast.   When  we  enact  such  a  Bill  as   this\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Bill, we do not merely enact\r\n\r\nit for the sake of enacting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  but, at the same time, we will carry out  its\r\n\r\nprovisions  to  the letter and  take  appropriate\r\n\r\naction  against employers who fail to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a convenient time to suspend.\r\n\r\nI shall take the Chair again at half-past five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\"><i>at 4.57 p.m. until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question,\r\n\r\n\"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. Kandasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. Kandasamy (Kampong Kapor):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  responsibility for the maintenance  of\r\n\r\nthe country's industrial peace is tripartite.  It\r\n\r\nrests on the Government, on the employers and  on\r\n\r\nthe  workers. But Government up to 1959 had  been\r\n\r\nnothing more than an administrative machinery  to\r\n\r\nbe used by the employers, and a machinery for the\r\n\r\nenforcement  of order over the workers,  so  that\r\n\r\nthe  exploitation of the workers  could  continue\r\n\r\nunhindered. In those circumstances,  it  was  not\r\n\r\nsurprising to find that all arbitration tribunals\r\n\r\nand courts of enquiries had been directed against\r\n\r\nthe  workers, and had never been impartial bodies\r\n\r\nat all. We have had examples of these in the case\r\n\r\nof  the  Naval  Base Arbitration  Tribunal  whose\r\n\r\nChairman  was  on  the  reserved  list   of   the\r\n\r\nAdmiralty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago, We former Government set up a\r\n\r\nCourt of Inquiry, and when its findings were  not\r\n\r\nfavourable  to  the  Government,  the  Government\r\n\r\nrefused  to implement the findings of that  Court\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry. It was not long ago that the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park was a member of  the  so-called\r\n\r\nindependent   panel  of  the  Industrial   Courts\r\n\r\nOrdinance. Those were the conditions under  which\r\n\r\nthe workers found themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  were faced with so-called independent Chairmen\r\n\r\nand  independent persons, but they were, in  fact,\r\n\r\nnot independent at all but, in one way or another,\r\n\r\nwere associated with the employers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employers,\r\n\r\ntoo,   have   a   responsibility  for  maintaining\r\n\r\nindustrial peace. But the employers of today  have\r\n\r\nnever  progressed  from  the  days  of  indentured\r\n\r\nlabour, the Kangani system. The trade unions  have\r\n\r\nquite often found it difficult to expect employers\r\n\r\nto  abide  by  collective agreement, and  even  to\r\n\r\nobserve  the  minimum requirements of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Even now we come across employers  who\r\n\r\nare   not  observing  the  Labour  Ordinance,  the\r\n\r\nminimum standards laid down by the Shop Assistants\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and  the  Clerks Employment  Ordinance.\r\n\r\nWith  these  experiences  the  workers  could   do\r\n\r\nnothing  else  but  resort to  industrial  action.\r\n\r\nTheir frustrations and discontent found expression\r\n\r\nin strikes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party contested the election on a policy\r\n\r\nbased  on  industrial  peace  with  justice.   Its\r\n\r\nleaders  have  for  a very long time  worked  with\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  and  with  the  workers,  and  were\r\n\r\ntrusted  by them. True to the policy of my  Party.\r\n\r\nthis Bill has been introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill introduces a new chapter in the\r\n\r\nhistory  of  our country. For the  first  time  it\r\n\r\nintroduces a new concept, the concept of the force\r\n\r\nof law to collective agreement voluntarily reached\r\n\r\nbetween employers and workers. Never before has  a\r\n\r\ncollective  agreement been binding.  Never  before\r\n\r\nhas   a  collective  agreement  been  enforceable.\r\n\r\nEmployers have just ignored agreements whenever it\r\n\r\nsuits  them.  Agreements have been signed  on  one\r\n\r\nday,  and on the following day, the employers have\r\n\r\njust  ignored them. To my mind, this is  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant   step   taken  to  promote   collective\r\n\r\nbargaining in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also aims at promoting collective\r\n\r\nbargaining  between employers and their respective\r\n\r\ntrade  union of workers. As the Bill  will,  at  a\r\n\r\nlater  stage,  be amended, it will be  found  that\r\n\r\ncollective   bargaining  is  being  kept   between\r\n\r\nemployers and trade unions of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is to avoid the present situation whereby  an\r\n\r\nassociation of employers reached agreement with  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union  of  workmen,  and  subsequently  the\r\n\r\nindividual   employers  resigned  from   the   old\r\n\r\nassociation and refused to abide by that agreement\r\n\r\nwhich  they were a party to when they were members\r\n\r\nof  the  old  association.  In  order  to  prevent\r\n\r\nemployers  from  cluttering up  the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court by forwarding, by default,  all\r\n\r\ndisputes  to the Court, the Bill will  enable  the\r\n\r\nunions  to  decide whether or not to  take  strike\r\n\r\naction.  The  right to strike is still maintained.\r\n\r\nIt  must be maintained, otherwise we might find  a\r\n\r\nsituation  where  the Arbitration  Court  will  be\r\n\r\ncluttered  up with all those trade disputes  which\r\n\r\ncan rightly be solved by negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the right to strike must be exercised in a\r\n\r\nresponsible manner. As long as it is exercised for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the workers, it must be maintained.\r\n\r\nThis Bill provides sufficient freedom, and, at the\r\n\r\nsame  time, sufficient protection to see that this\r\n\r\nweapon  is  not used by wild men to enhance  their\r\n\r\npersonal  power  or to coerce the Government.  The\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists have accepted the principle  that\r\n\r\ntrade   union  leaders  who  obstruct  the  proper\r\n\r\nfunctioning  of the Court should be punished,  but\r\n\r\nnot the union as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Law must be complimented for agreeing to the deletion of the\r\n\r\nprovisions  dealing with the cancellation  of  the\r\n\r\nregistration  of unions whose leaders deliberately\r\n\r\nflouted the orders of the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The denial of the right of representation before\r\n\r\nthe Court to an advocate and solicitor is in order\r\n\r\nto direct the attention of the Court to the merits\r\n\r\nof  the  case before it, rather than to engage  in\r\n\r\nlegal   technicalities   and   formalities.   This\r\n\r\nparticular clause will enable trade unions  to  be\r\n\r\nrepresented  by persons who are considered  to  be\r\n\r\nmost suitable for this task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill cast a slur on the\r\n\r\ntrade  union movement when he said that the  trade\r\n\r\nunions   did   not  have  sufficient   experienced\r\n\r\nofficers to represent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  case  of  the workers before the  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt. Sir, the trade union movement is capable of\r\n\r\nlooking   after   itself.   It   is   capable   of\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the interests of the workers  before\r\n\r\nthis  Court - so long as we know that the  Court  is\r\n\r\nthere  to  judge and decide on the merits  of  the\r\n\r\ncase  and not on the form of representation or  on\r\n\r\nthe technicalities of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill must be supported if we are to solve\r\n\r\nour  economic ills and expand our economy so  that\r\n\r\nwe  may  abolish unemployment from our country.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  this  Bill is one that will  keep  labour\r\n\r\ndisputes to a minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory arbitration is not a popular\r\n\r\nsolution.  It is not a solution wholly  acceptable\r\n\r\nto  the unions. But in the situation that we  find\r\n\r\nourselves  in today, there is no better instrument\r\n\r\nthan  compulsory  arbitration. In  this  Bill  the\r\n\r\nemphasis  is  on collective bargaining.  But  when\r\n\r\ncollective   bargaining  fails,  there   must   be\r\n\r\narbitration, and arbitration, if it is to succeed,\r\n\r\nmust  also  have  the force of  law.  It  must  be\r\n\r\nbinding  on the parties that do appear before  the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court. This Bill provides  such  force\r\n\r\nof  law.  I,  for  one, am sure  that  responsible\r\n\r\nleaders on either side of the labour dispute  will\r\n\r\nresort  to  collective bargaining. But both  sides\r\n\r\nhave  their  wild men, perhaps the employers  more\r\n\r\nthan  the  workers, and to ensure that these  wild\r\n\r\nmen do not destroy our standards of living and our\r\n\r\neconomy,  this Bill is necessary. Sir,  I  support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T.

Members in the Opposition.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  they are not sure on which side the  Bill\r\n\r\nis  weighted,  whether it is on the  side  of  the\r\n\r\nemployers or on the side of the workers.  However,\r\n\r\nthe Bill before the House today is, as a matter of\r\n\r\nfact,  the  most  important piece  of  legislation\r\n\r\nintroduced by the Government so far, and one  that\r\n\r\nhas  initiated widespread interest and discussion.\r\n\r\nEmployers  and  bodies  of  employers  have  quite\r\n\r\nobviously  scrutinised  the  Bill  carefully.  The\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  has editorially commented  on  the\r\n\r\nBill more than once, and has even aired the unsaid\r\n\r\nfears of the employers. On\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe other hand, Sir, the trade unions have set  up\r\n\r\nspecial sub-committees to study the Bill and  have\r\n\r\ngone  over,  clause by clause, the provisions  for\r\n\r\nand   against  their  interests.  The  unions  and\r\n\r\nemployers   have  made  representations   to   the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed my duty today to speak both as\r\n\r\na  trade  unionist and as a Government Member,  as\r\n\r\none who understands and shares the aspirations  of\r\n\r\nthe   workers   and  recognises   the   legitimate\r\n\r\ndemocratic rights of the trade unions in the field\r\n\r\nof  industrial  relations, and as one  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the  ideals and objectives of  the  Party.  I\r\n\r\nthink,  Sir,  at  the outset it  is  important  to\r\n\r\nmention  the  fact  that although  both  sides - the\r\n\r\nemployers and the employees - seem to have expressed\r\n\r\ncertain  fears  with regard to the application  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  no one so far appears to quarrel  with\r\n\r\nthe   intention   of  the  Bill.  The   underlying\r\n\r\nprinciple   of  the  P.A.P.'s  labour  policy   is\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace with justice. This will  be  the\r\n\r\nobjective  which  the Bill in its  final  form  is\r\n\r\nintended  to achieve, and the truth of all  truths\r\n\r\nis to put into practice this principle in the most\r\n\r\neffective and workable manner. Fears we all  have.\r\n\r\nI  am  sure  Members  of this House  have  various\r\n\r\nfears,  just as the employers and the trade unions\r\n\r\nhave  fears on the result of the operation of this\r\n\r\nBill.  I  am being frank and honest when  I  state\r\n\r\nhere in clear and unambiguous terms the fears  and\r\n\r\nthe worries of the workers and the trade unions in\r\n\r\nregard to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I proceed any further, I must state\r\n\r\nquite  definitely  that  despite  the  fears   and\r\n\r\nconcern of the workers, they are quite prepared to\r\n\r\naccept the Bill, with the amendments, in the final\r\n\r\nform  in which it appears after the trimming. This\r\n\r\nis solely because they have hope and confidence in\r\n\r\nthe  men  who  are  going to  be  responsible  for\r\n\r\noperating  this Bill, namely, the Members  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, Sir, I just want to refer to a\r\n\r\nstatement  by  the hon. Member for  Cairnhill.  He\r\n\r\nsounded  as  though he was sorry that he  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  the opportunity of introducing such  a  Bill\r\n\r\nduring  his term of office. Let me tell the  House\r\n\r\nquite plainly this. If it is the Lim Yew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHock  Government which were to introduce the Bill,\r\n\r\nthen  I  say today there would be workers  outside\r\n\r\nholding  placards, his the faith in the leadership\r\n\r\nof  the  Government and in the basic intention  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, i.e. to mete out justice to the workers\r\n\r\nwhile  preserving  peace on the industrial  front,\r\n\r\nwhich led the trade unions to take this decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to refer very briefly to a few clauses\r\n\r\nwhich  are  causing  some apprehension  among  the\r\n\r\nworkers. To start with, it is necessary to examine\r\n\r\nthe difference between the Party's election pledge\r\n\r\nand  the  provisions of this Bill. In the  Party's\r\n\r\nmanifesto  during the elections in regard  to  the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court, it was stated that  the  union\r\n\r\ncould opt to be brought within the jurisdiction of\r\n\r\nsuch a court. When the union so opts, the employer\r\n\r\nis  automatically brought within the  jurisdiction\r\n\r\nof the court. This, Sir, is no longer the case now\r\n\r\nunder  this Bill, and quite rightly there is  some\r\n\r\nuncertainty  and  worry creeping  into  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 of the Bill, as the amendments to be\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the Minister will provide,  will  allow\r\n\r\nemployers and the trade unions who are parties  to\r\n\r\na  trade  dispute  to  make a request  jointly  in\r\n\r\nwriting to the Registrar that the trade dispute be\r\n\r\nsubmitted to arbitration, and when this  is  done,\r\n\r\nthe  court  shall  have cognizance  of  the  trade\r\n\r\ndispute.  The fear of the trade unions is  on  the\r\n\r\nopportunities   which  this   clause   will   give\r\n\r\nemployers  to refer, or refuse to refer,  disputes\r\n\r\nwith  the  unions  according to  their  particular\r\n\r\nbenefits  and thus make the workers helpless.  But\r\n\r\nthe  safeguard  against  this  possible  abuse  is\r\n\r\nprovided  by a sub-clause under the clause,  where\r\n\r\nthe  Minister will have the authority to direct  a\r\n\r\ndispute to arbitration. Here it is appropriate to)\r\n\r\ndraw an illustrious example of what I said just a\r\n\r\nlittle  earlier. While the unions strongly  desire\r\n\r\nwhat  was  promised to them during the  elections,\r\n\r\nthey are prepared to accept the amendments to this\r\n\r\nprinciple,  in  the  belief  and  faith  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, in particular the Minister who has  to\r\n\r\noperate this Bill, will do so judiciously\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  in  a manner that will preserve the unity  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers and add strength to the working class\r\n\r\nmovement.  But  sad to say, Sir, if  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwere to be, for example, the Member for Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nthen  we would have to be prepared to face another\r\n\r\nround of the industrial unrests of 1955 and 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer to clause 32. Here, the Court in\r\n\r\nreaching its decision may have regard not only  to\r\n\r\nthe interests of the persons immediately concerned\r\n\r\nbut  to  the interest of the community as a  whole\r\n\r\nand  to the economy of the State as a whole.  This\r\n\r\nclause   is  considered  by  workers  to   be   an\r\n\r\nemployers' clause, for the simple reason  that  it\r\n\r\nappears   to  transmit  the  frequent   howls   of\r\n\r\nemployers. We all know that employers are  in  the\r\n\r\nhabit  of  crying  about  the  interests  of   the\r\n\r\ncommunity and the conditions of the economy of the\r\n\r\nState  every time the unions make claims for  just\r\n\r\nand  improved  conditions of  employment  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers. It must be stated that this clause in the\r\n\r\nBill  affords opportunities for employers  to  try\r\n\r\nand  seek to prejudice the reaching of a just  and\r\n\r\nreasonable  settlement through arbitration.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter of fact, without any Ordinance to cite, the\r\n\r\ncounsel for the Singapore Traction Company, in its\r\n\r\nrecent  dispute  with  the union,  at  the  actual\r\n\r\nhearing  roared something to the effect  that  the\r\n\r\neyes  of the industry were upon the Tribunal,  and\r\n\r\nthat the eyes particularly of those investors  who\r\n\r\nsought  to invest money in the City were  watching\r\n\r\ncarefully the deliberations of the Tribunal, it is\r\n\r\nwell  known now, Sir, what effect this has had  on\r\n\r\nthe  Tribunal which was fairly constituted and  it\r\n\r\nis  not unlikely that there will be many more  Mr\r\n\r\nHills in the future casting intimidatory words  at\r\n\r\nthe  proposed Court and the President. It is  also\r\n\r\nnot unlikely that it may affect adversely the case\r\n\r\nof  the  employers. But nevertheless, I must  warn\r\n\r\nthat  if  the  decision of  the  Court  is  to  go\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the  interests and feelings  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers, because  of  the over-emphasis  of  this\r\n\r\nclause,  there will be grave dangers in  that  the\r\n\r\nCourt  will not only be brought into disrepute  in\r\n\r\nthe eyes of the workers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the whole machinery of arbitration jammed, but\r\n\r\nthe   employers  will  also  have  to   bear   the\r\n\r\nconsequences.  Sir, this is not to  say  that  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the whole community and the whole eco\r\n\r\nnomy should not be considered, but they should not\r\n\r\nbe  a  blind  for  all kinds of spurious  argument\r\n\r\nadvancing selfish interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, I have one point to make on the penal\r\n\r\nclauses.  Here,  what is of deep  concern  to  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  is the provision that  will  appear\r\n\r\nafter  the amendment which will prohibit  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  leader  from holding office for  a  certain\r\n\r\nperiod.  To  forfeit the trade  union  leader  the\r\n\r\nright  to be an officer is something that no union\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  see happen, and I  am  sure  that\r\n\r\nnobody  on  this side of the House is particularly\r\n\r\nkeen  to  deprive any leader of the  right  to  be\r\n\r\nelected. The intention of the Government to  check\r\n\r\nirresponsible Trade unionism is appreciated by the\r\n\r\nunions.  But the fear remains on the grounds  that\r\n\r\nthis clause may be abused. However, this fear will\r\n\r\nbe  rendered  groundless  if  the  officer  is  of\r\n\r\nobvious  integrity.  These are  the  main  clauses\r\n\r\nwhich remain a source of uncertainty and worry  to\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions,  but what  is  of  the  utmost\r\n\r\nimportance is the actual function of the Court and\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of the various  provisions  of\r\n\r\nthe Bill. Hope for the workers emerges as a result\r\n\r\nof  the  confidence in the men who  are  going  to\r\n\r\noperate  this Bill. As far as the trade unions  of\r\n\r\nworkers are concerned, the passing of this Bill in\r\n\r\nwhatever form is not the be all and end all of the\r\n\r\nmatter.  I  might say that certain  employers  who\r\n\r\nhave  yet to learn the lessons of the past - lessons\r\n\r\nof  reality -   may  feel  that  they  can  use  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill to harass and irritate the\r\n\r\nunions.  And  there  may be undesirable  elements,\r\n\r\npimps  and  stooges of vested interests,  who  may\r\n\r\nwant  to  sabotage the proper functioning of  this\r\n\r\nCourt.  Sir, it is common knowledge to  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  witnessed and who have participated  in  the\r\n\r\ncombats  between the employers and  employees  how\r\n\r\njolly well employers desire to maintain industrial\r\n\r\npeace  but resist justice from being done  to  the\r\n\r\nworkers. If this is going to be the case,  then  I\r\n\r\nmust point out that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade  unions of workers are not going to let  the\r\n\r\nemployers  get away with that. The employers  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  face the force of a united and determind\r\n\r\ntrade union movement, and while the Government has\r\n\r\ndecided to establish and foster industrial  peace,\r\n\r\nit  has made it abundantly clear that it will  not\r\n\r\nallow  injustice to be meted out to  workers.  Let\r\n\r\nthere be no doubts in the minds of employers  that\r\n\r\nif  and when such a situation develops, the  whole\r\n\r\nmachinery of the Government will be trained on the\r\n\r\nemployer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I have no doubt\r\n\r\nthat the trade unions will give every co-operation\r\n\r\nand assistance to the Government to work the Bill,\r\n\r\nand  my  only  hope  is  that  the  employers   do\r\n\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak on the\r\n\r\nBill  which we are now debating. I understand that\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of this Bill is to promote industrial\r\n\r\npeace.  I  have  heard  it  expressed  by  several\r\n\r\nexperts  or champions of the labour movement  that\r\n\r\nthis Bill aims at protecting the interests of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  However,  there are many  provisions  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill which affect the prosperity and economy\r\n\r\nof our State. On the whole, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot  entirely  disagree  with  this  Bill.  It  is\r\n\r\nforeseeable that this Bill will not be referred to\r\n\r\na  Select Committee and that it is necessary  that\r\n\r\ncertain provisions therein should be amended. I do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to  be a defender of the Government  on\r\n\r\nthis  issue. But we must be careful if we want  to\r\n\r\nensure  the peace and prosperity of the  State.  I\r\n\r\nknow,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Members  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  side  have declared  that  it  is  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the P.A.P. to fight for the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  I,  as a Member on  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nside,  do not deny this. It is a fact and we  have\r\n\r\nhad  proof that it is the policy of the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nbe the champions of the workers on this island.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that most of the workers in the labour\r\n\r\nmovement  are illiterate in the English  language.\r\n\r\nWhen this Bill is enacted, all the provisions will\r\n\r\nbe printed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin English. I am sure not all the workers will be\r\n\r\nable  to  comprehend  the  true  meaning  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Bill which we are now debating.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  think the time has  come  for  the\r\n\r\nchampions  of  the workers who  are  now  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment side and who, as I have said  earlier,\r\n\r\nhave achieved successful results in the field  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unionism,  to guide the workers  in  their\r\n\r\ninterest.  In  this situation, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nlawyers  should also be given the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nrepresent either the employers or employees in  a\r\n\r\ntrade   dispute  when  it  is  referred  to   the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court for settlement, because if  the\r\n\r\nworkers  are not represented by a lawyer  in  the\r\n\r\nCourt, I am confident that the employers who have\r\n\r\nall  the necessary resources will be able to  put\r\n\r\nforward their case better than can the employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot disagree with the Bill as a whole. But I have\r\n\r\nnot yet received any clarification concerning the\r\n\r\nreported  agreement reached as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\ndiscussions   between  the   trade   unions   and\r\n\r\nemployers. We should have clarification  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  as  to what percentage of trade unions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to dwell on this Bill at length,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  and I am prepared to  receive  any\r\n\r\nexplanation from the Government. But if  this  is\r\n\r\nunacceptable to us, it is just like  the  proverb\r\n\r\nof the camel having to surrender to its master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>\r\n\r\n<b></b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we are fully aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  Industrial  Relations  Bill  has  been\r\n\r\ndiscussed  at  great length during the  past  few\r\n\r\nweeks. The labour movement and the employers have\r\n\r\nexpressed  their  intention  to  join  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  stabilise  the  economy   through\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations. We are determined  not  to\r\n\r\nallow an atmosphere which would create industrial\r\n\r\nchaos.  We are also determined to make an all-out\r\n\r\neffort  to  maintain industrial  peace.  We  have\r\n\r\nheard  the views of the Members on the Opposition\r\n\r\nside  on  this  Bill and all the criticisms  that\r\n\r\nhave been put forward\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill    be   considered   by   Government.    The\r\n\r\nimplementation of this Bill will be  carried  out\r\n\r\njudiciously.   The  Government   has   considered\r\n\r\ncarefully  the  amendments put up by  the  labour\r\n\r\nmovement   and   employers  and   after   careful\r\n\r\nconsideration of these amendments, the Government\r\n\r\nhas made several amendments to this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be understood that all those concerned\r\n\r\nin  a  trade dispute should be asked to reach  an\r\n\r\namicable  settlement, but there  are  times  when\r\n\r\nsuch  a  settlement cannot be reached because  of\r\n\r\nthe attitude adopted by one side or by the other.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  such  a  situation,  the\r\n\r\nMinister then should be empowered to have  a  say\r\n\r\nin the matter and thus avoid what would otherwise\r\n\r\nbe  a  bad situation. If it is felt that the only\r\n\r\nrecourse  to  the trade unions  is  to  be  given\r\n\r\ncomplete  freedom  to take industrial  action  or\r\n\r\nresort to strike action in order to achieve their\r\n\r\nobjectives,  it  is  not  the  intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to deny them this right. However,  it\r\n\r\nis  important for the Minister and the Government\r\n\r\nto  have  powers  to  achieve  industrial  peace.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is found necessary  to  give  such\r\n\r\npowers  to  the  Minister  who  will,  no  doubt,\r\n\r\nimplement the provisions of this Bill judiciously\r\n\r\nin  any trade dispute which may arise. This  Bill\r\n\r\nat first was considered to be too drastic, but it\r\n\r\nwas  subsequently  found necessary  to  strike  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between the employers and  the  workers.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, it is admitted that clause  82  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  concerning \"go slow\" action  will  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out by the workers because it is  feared\r\n\r\nthat  certain unscrupulous employers will exploit\r\n\r\nthis clause to the detriment of the workers.  We,\r\n\r\nthe   Government,  admit  that  the  workers  and\r\n\r\nemployers  now  have a new sense of consciousness\r\n\r\nand we feel that such a state of relations should\r\n\r\nbe  reflected in agreements which are  backed  by\r\n\r\nlaw. Such agreements or decisions reached in  the\r\n\r\nCourt  will  definitely stabilise conditions  and\r\n\r\nbenefit the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Bill particularly aims at achieving industrial peace with justice in this\r\n\r\ncountry.  Not  only  does  this  rest  with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, but all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerned   must   make  an  effort   to   achieve\r\n\r\nindustrial  peace with justice. Therefore,  anyone\r\n\r\nwho  shirks  his  obligations and responsibilities\r\n\r\nwill  find  that there are clauses  in  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwhereby action can justifiably be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  since  the  introduction  of   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Bill in Singapore,  everyone\r\n\r\nhas  concentrated his attention on it. We all know\r\n\r\nthat Singapore is a small island. If any sector of\r\n\r\nthe community is not well looked after, then there\r\n\r\nwill be no peace in industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill was moved for Second Reading, our\r\n\r\nfriends   on   the  Opposition  side   felt   very\r\n\r\ninterested and made speeches in the hope that they\r\n\r\nwould become the champions of the workers. So they\r\n\r\ncriticised  this and that, saying that  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwas  not  appropriate. Of course, we know that  if\r\n\r\nany  clause  of  this  Bill  is  contrary  to  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the people, then the people will  not\r\n\r\nwelcome the Bill and will not support it.  We  can\r\n\r\nsee  for  ourselves very clearly that  during  the\r\n\r\nLabour Front Government the representatives of the\r\n\r\ntrade unions had discussed with them at that  time\r\n\r\nthe  impracticability of a  Bill  which  they  had\r\n\r\nwanted to put through concerning the trade unions.\r\n\r\nAt  that time, if they could have looked after the\r\n\r\npeople  well and had listened to them, then  there\r\n\r\nwould  not have been so many placards and  slogans\r\n\r\nagainst them. It is evident that their actions and\r\n\r\nattitudes  were  against  the  interests  of   the\r\n\r\npeople.  But  today  they  feel  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  neglect  the  interests  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and put through the Bill. They are  under\r\n\r\nthe impression that, in criticising the Government\r\n\r\nBill,  they  will  become  the  champions  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  However, my colleagues  have  explicitly\r\n\r\ndeclared  that  in drafting this  Bill  they  have\r\n\r\naccepted representations from every sector of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity. And we can say that in the interests of\r\n\r\nthe  people,  we  have tried  to  repeal  the  old\r\n\r\nOrdinance  without fear. They are putting  a  mask\r\n\r\nover their face, being themselves cheats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Sir, this Bill is\r\n\r\nthe first attempt to bring order into the field of\r\n\r\nindustrial  relations,  and  to  allow  reason  to\r\n\r\nprevail.  It is in pursuance of the Labour  policy\r\n\r\nof  the  People's Action Party. At the  outset,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to point out that in one  respect  we\r\n\r\nhave departed from the set programme of the Party,\r\n\r\nnamely, in giving power to the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nand   Law   to   send  a  matter  to  arbitration,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  the wishes of  the  union  or  the\r\n\r\nemployer. It was our original intention to try and\r\n\r\nwork  out  a  scheme whereby all unions  could  be\r\n\r\naffiliated to a Trades Union Congress, which would\r\n\r\nopt  for  arbitration  on behalf  of  all  unions.\r\n\r\nHowever,   the   Minister,  after  eight   months'\r\n\r\nexperience in his Ministry, has assured  us  that,\r\n\r\nregardless of the ultimate shape and form  of  the\r\n\r\nT.U.C. and its constitution, it is necessary  for\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to have this reserve power in  order\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that, in the unlikely  event  of  both\r\n\r\nunion  leaders  and employers being  recalcitrant,\r\n\r\nmatters  should  not  be  allowed  to  take  their\r\n\r\nillogical  course and end in an industrial  strike\r\n\r\nand confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to deal with points of\r\n\r\ndetail - they  have been raised by  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  I  shall leave that to my  colleague,\r\n\r\nthe  Hon. Minister who is moving the Bill.  But  I\r\n\r\nwould like to answer Members of the Opposition  on\r\n\r\ntheir  request  that this Bill be  referred  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee. My colleagues and I have  given\r\n\r\ncareful consideration to whether or not this  Bill\r\n\r\nshould go to a Select Committee. The conclusion we\r\n\r\ncame  to  is that the sooner the Bill is  enacted,\r\n\r\nthe  sooner we can get the provisions worked  out,\r\n\r\nand the better possible it is for the Minister  to\r\n\r\nimplement our Labour policy. It would take several\r\n\r\nmonths  to have the Court set up, the form agreed,\r\n\r\nand  the machinery set in motion. To send the Bill\r\n\r\nto a Select Committee where it may lie for another\r\n\r\nthree  or  four months would be another  three  or\r\n\r\nfour months lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of principle, may I say that\r\n\r\nthis  is a new field of legislation? Whether these\r\n\r\nprovisions are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npracticable  and  workable, or  whether  they  are\r\n\r\nacademic  and  unsuited to local conditions,  will\r\n\r\nnot  depend  upon an academic debate in  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  but upon the actual implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of the Bill. On principle, we  are\r\n\r\ndetermined - as  indeed we have  the  right  to  be,\r\n\r\nhaving  stated  it quite clearly in  our  election\r\n\r\nprogramme - to  bring about industrial peace  which,\r\n\r\nat  the same time, ensures that justice is done to\r\n\r\nthe workers. If there were a question of principle\r\n\r\ninvolved  in which employers or unions could  make\r\n\r\nrepresentations on the basic features of the Bill,\r\n\r\nthen  some  useful  purpose  might  be  served  by\r\n\r\nsending  it to a Select Committee. But as  far  as\r\n\r\nthe  main features of the Bill are concerned,  its\r\n\r\nframework  and  its  structure have  already  been\r\n\r\ndecided upon, namely, that the emphasis must be on\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  Provisions  have  been   laid   out\r\n\r\nwhereby   unions  can  either  get  or   not   get\r\n\r\nrecognition.  Provisions are laid out  as  to  how\r\n\r\nnegotiations  can  be  commenced   and   must   be\r\n\r\ncommenced. Provisions are made as to what is to be\r\n\r\ndone if either negotiations are not commenced,  or\r\n\r\na deadlock is reached in negotiations. There is no\r\n\r\nquestion  of  principle involved on which  we  can\r\n\r\ngive  way.  The only question is on the smoothness\r\n\r\nof   the  implementation  of  the  intentions  and\r\n\r\nobjects of the Bill. That is a matter which we can\r\n\r\nonly learn from experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two principal objectives which this\r\n\r\nBill  seeks  to achieve. First, that  the  workers\r\n\r\nreceive their fair share of the fruits which their\r\n\r\nlabour  helps  to create. Second, that  it  should\r\n\r\nestablish   conditions  which  are  conducive   to\r\n\r\nindustrial expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if only the first objective is achieved,\r\n\r\nnamely, that workers get their fair share, or more\r\n\r\nthan their fair share, without creating conditions\r\n\r\nconducive  to  industrial  expansion,   then   our\r\n\r\nproblems of unemployment will mount over the  next\r\n\r\nfour  years to disproportionate figures  by  1964.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is fundamental that we should  also\r\n\r\nachieve  stability  in  industrial  relations,  to\r\n\r\nassist  the  necessary expansion of  industry,  to\r\n\r\ncreate employment for the 20,000 to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30,000  young men and women who every, year  enter\r\n\r\nthe field looking for jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the other hand, if this Bill only\r\n\r\nsucceeds  in  creating  stability  for  industrial\r\n\r\nexpansion,  without  bringing  the  benefits   and\r\n\r\nensuring  that  fair  shares  are  given  to   the\r\n\r\nworkers,  then we will have failed as  a  movement\r\n\r\ndedicated to the advancement of the working class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our hope that an intelligent application\r\n\r\nof  the  provisions of this Bill by the Government\r\n\r\nwill  prepare  the  conditions  under  which  both\r\n\r\nobjectives can be secured. Needless to say, it  is\r\n\r\nfundamental to the working of the whole Bill  that\r\n\r\nthe Court must be so constituted that it earns the\r\n\r\nrespect,  if  not the admiration, of both  workers\r\n\r\nand  employers.  That  is,  the  awards  must   be\r\n\r\nbalanced and fair, made on the merits not only  of\r\n\r\nthe  dispute but of the dispute within the context\r\n\r\nof the whole complex of our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not pretend that all parts of the Bill\r\n\r\ncommend  themselves  to employers  or  to  unions.\r\n\r\nThere  are several provisions in the Bill to which\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  of  Employers  takes  exception.\r\n\r\nIndeed, as some Members on the Government side  of\r\n\r\nthe House have informed you, Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nunions  are  not  without their views  as  to  the\r\n\r\npossible    effects    of   certain    provisions,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  penal  ones  on   trade   union\r\n\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last analysis, it is the balancing of\r\n\r\ncompeting  interests - first, fair  shares  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers; and, second, industrial conditions  which\r\n\r\nwill encourage investment and expansion - which  has\r\n\r\nresulted in the Bill and its proposed amendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could have done one of two things. The\r\n\r\nfirst  one is to proceed with the Bill,  which  we\r\n\r\nare doing. The other is to leave things alone. The\r\n\r\nsecond  alternative  really  means  the  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  which prevailed for many years  past,  in\r\n\r\nwhich   there   were   no  adequate   and   proper\r\n\r\nlegislative  controls,  resulting  very  often  in\r\n\r\nunlimited scraps between employers and unions, and\r\n\r\nthe  intervention  of the Government  not  through\r\n\r\nlegislation   designed   for   the   purpose    of\r\n\r\ncontrolling  industrial disputes, but intervention\r\n\r\nthrough  legislation designed to maintain law  and\r\n\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  the  last analysis, if the law is flouted  and\r\n\r\ndisorder   prevails,  then  the  Government   must\r\n\r\nabdicate and allow disorder to be supreme.  It  is\r\n\r\nhoped  that  these special legislative  provisions\r\n\r\nwill  work and operate to maintain the balance  of\r\n\r\nthese  two competing objectives, and that it  will\r\n\r\nbe  unnecessary  ever to invoke  those  provisions\r\n\r\nmeant  for the supreme crisis where order must  be\r\n\r\nre-established at all costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this attempt to re-establish sense and\r\n\r\nstability  in  a  field so far left  untouched  by\r\n\r\ndetailed  legislation succeeds, if only  in  part,\r\n\r\nthen  I  think we should all be grateful  for  the\r\n\r\nadvance  the whole country would be making towards\r\n\r\nsense  and  stability in our industrial relations.\r\n\r\nIn  the  earnest hope that the sooner  we  achieve\r\n\r\neven  part of that objective that we have set  out\r\n\r\nto  achieve the better it will be, we have decided\r\n\r\nto  go  through with the Bill -  the Second Reading,\r\n\r\nthe  Committee stage and the Third Reading - at this\r\n\r\nsitting of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.41 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed very\r\n\r\ndisappointed   with   the   performance   of   the\r\n\r\nOpposition Front Bench this afternoon.

What he tried to do just now\r\n\r\nwas  to pick a few holes in a few clauses of  this\r\n\r\nBill  and suggest to the House that the Government\r\n\r\nhad  given very little attention to these matters.\r\n\r\nHe  then expressed regret that he, as head of  the\r\n\r\nformer Government, was unable to introduce similar\r\n\r\nlegislation when his Government was in power. Then\r\n\r\nhe  passed  on the buck to the Member  for  Farrer\r\n\r\nPark who graciously admitted that this was a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood  Bill,  but  regretted that it  had  so  many\r\n\r\nclauses, that it affected so many interests,  that\r\n\r\nhe  really  had  not  much time  to  consider  the\r\n\r\ncontents of this Bill, and that it would  be  most\r\n\r\nagreeable  to  all the Members of  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nFront Bench if this Bill could be sent to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  for  further  consideration,  and   for\r\n\r\nfurther inaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also noticeable, Mr Speaker, Sir, that\r\n\r\ntoday  the  Member for Tanglin has  shown  a  very\r\n\r\ngreat reluctance to perform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

He  appeared  to  be   very\r\n\r\nconfused about the question of the appointment  of\r\n\r\nthe President of the Court. He wondered why it was\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara   to\r\n\r\nappoint   the   President  of  the   Court   after\r\n\r\nconsultation with the Prime Minister, and  why  it\r\n\r\nshould be left to the Minister for Labour and  Law\r\n\r\nto appoint the Acting President. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  have given this question of the appointment of\r\n\r\nthe President of the Court considerable attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the wording of this Bill is so\r\n\r\nphrased  as  to  shut out the  provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service  Commission  in  relation  to  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  the President of this  Court.  It\r\n\r\nwill   be  appreciated  that  it  would  be  crass\r\n\r\nstupidity on the part of the Government if it ever\r\n\r\nwas  tempted to let the Public Service  Commission\r\n\r\nput  out an advertisement calling for applications\r\n\r\nfor  this  appointment. If we did so, I think  the\r\n\r\nOpposition Front Bench might lose another Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will see from clause 4 of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  that  it  is  the  intention  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  the person who is  appointed  to\r\n\r\nthis high office will have the rights, privileges,\r\n\r\nprotection and immunity of a Judge of the  Supreme\r\n\r\nCourt.  The constitution of the State of Singapore\r\n\r\nprovides  that  Judges  do  not  hold  any  public\r\n\r\noffice; that they hold public office only for  the\r\n\r\npurposes of ensuring their pension rights. It  was\r\n\r\nvery necessary, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this method\r\n\r\nof  appointing  an independent President  of  this\r\n\r\nCourt should be adopted by the Government. In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  the Acting President, when the President\r\n\r\nis away, we felt that such an appointment could be\r\n\r\nsafely  entrusted in the hands of the  appropriate\r\n\r\nMinister. In this case, the Minister will  be  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Labour and Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Cairn-hill has\r\n\r\nsuggested  that it would be a good  thing  if  all\r\n\r\nthose  who  serve on the committees  of  political\r\n\r\nParties  were excluded from either the  employers'\r\n\r\nor  the  employees'  panel. Mr  Speaker,  we  are\r\n\r\nalways  accused by the Opposition  of  being  very\r\n\r\nilliberal in our ideas. We are accused of  wanting\r\n\r\nto  place shackles on trade unions and wanting  to\r\n\r\ninhibit  political  Parties  from  functioning.  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest to the Member for Cairn-hill that it\r\n\r\nwould  be  unfair to place such a  restriction  on\r\n\r\npersons, who are connected -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A democratic person's rights\r\n\r\nand privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> - with political Parties, from\r\n\r\nserving  on these panels.

Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nsurely he would not think it unfair that we should\r\n\r\neven consider such a proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill has not understood the intentions of sub-clause (2) of clause 9 of this Bill. Would it  not\r\n\r\nbe  more  appropriate  to  allow  a  member  of  a\r\n\r\npolitical  Party  or  a  committee  member  of   a\r\n\r\npolitical Party to serve on these panels? If  they\r\n\r\nshow  by their attitudes that they are not persons\r\n\r\nto  be trusted, and if they show that they are not\r\n\r\npersons  who  will  serve  impartially  on   these\r\n\r\npanels, it could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  left  then  to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  to\r\n\r\nremove them from these panels on the grounds  that\r\n\r\nthey are not fit and proper persons to be selected\r\n\r\nto  constitute  the court. Would  not  that  be  a\r\n\r\nfairer thing to do? Why prejudge the issue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now refer to another\r\n\r\ncriticism which the Member for Cairnhill has  made\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  clause  23  of  this  Bill.   He\r\n\r\nexpressed surprise that this clause provided  that\r\n\r\na memorandum of any collective agreement should be\r\n\r\nin  writing, but did not indicate that the writing\r\n\r\nof the memorandum should be in the Tamil, Chinese,\r\n\r\nEnglish or Malay language. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is\r\n\r\nthe intention of the Government to leave it to the\r\n\r\nparties  to  express their agreement  in  whatever\r\n\r\nlanguage they choose. If they do so, then there is\r\n\r\nprovision  in clause 45 sub-clause (2) for  copies\r\n\r\nto  be made of the document in the Malay, English,\r\n\r\nChinese  and  Tamil languages. Is  there  anything\r\n\r\nunfair in this? Are we placing any shackles on the\r\n\r\nparties?

He\r\n\r\nhas made a reference to clause 31 of this Bill and\r\n\r\nhas  said quite blithely here - why should the civil\r\n\r\nservants  be  put  to the trouble  of  getting  an\r\n\r\nendorsement from the Yang di-Pertuan Negara before\r\n\r\na civil service issue is to be put to arbitration?\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  unfortunately for  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill, I was a civil servant when he  was  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister of the Colony of Singapore. Amongst\r\n\r\nmy  other  duties was the duty of  drawing  up  an\r\n\r\narbitration  agreement  on  behalf  of  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice  with the Government of which  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill was the Chief Minister. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the Chief Minister understands very well that\r\n\r\nit  is  very necessary in civil service issues  to\r\n\r\nwrite   in   safeguards   into   any   arbitration\r\n\r\nagreement, because the civil service does not  run\r\n\r\nlike  ordinary businesses in the sense that it  is\r\n\r\ngeared  to produce a profit. In the civil  service\r\n\r\nthe   Government  is  not  entitled  to  use   the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers'  funds improperly. For that reason,  it\r\n\r\nis very necessary that no reference to arbitration\r\n\r\nshould  be  allowed which involves any expenditure\r\n\r\nfrom the public funds, or which in any way affects\r\n\r\nthe  discretion of the Public Service  Commission,\r\n\r\nunless the approval of the Head of State is  first\r\n\r\nobtained.  That is the practice in all  democratic\r\n\r\ncountries which run or operate civil services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park has\r\n\r\nstated  that other members of the Government  have\r\n\r\nreferred to the discussions which the Minister has\r\n\r\nhad  with  representatives of unions, but  he  has\r\n\r\nexpressed great surprise that the Minister himself\r\n\r\nwas  silent  in  regard to these matters  when  he\r\n\r\nmoved the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading of this Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I\r\n\r\nam   now  going  to  inform  the  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  Front  Bench that  I  have  taken  the\r\n\r\ntrouble  to discuss the clauses of this Bill  with\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the trade unions who have shown  more\r\n\r\ninterest  in this Bill than any of those  who  are\r\n\r\nsitting now on the Opposition Front Bench. I  will\r\n\r\nrefer  particularly to clauses in this Bill  which\r\n\r\nwere  discussed  during the time that  I  held  my\r\n\r\ndiscussions with the representatives of the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will look at clause 16\r\n\r\nyou  will see that the intention there is that the\r\n\r\ncollective   bargaining   procedure   should    be\r\n\r\navailable both to the employer and to the union of\r\n\r\nemployers. The unions complained that it would  be\r\n\r\nunfair  to  allow  a trade union of  employers  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  any collective agreement with  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  of employees in the sense that the  bargain\r\n\r\ning  strength  of one was much stronger  than  the\r\n\r\nbargaining  strength of the  other.  It  was  also\r\n\r\nrepresented  to  me that it would  not  serve  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the economy of the State if employers\r\n\r\nwere allowed to reach collective agreements with a\r\n\r\ntrade  union  of  employees  through  a  union  of\r\n\r\nemployers. The more prosperous employers could get\r\n\r\nthemselves linked up in a union and thereby try to\r\n\r\nget  an  agreement with a trade union of  workmen.\r\n\r\nThe  effect would be that the employer who is  not\r\n\r\nin  the trade union of employers would not be able\r\n\r\nto  pay  the same wages as those employers in  the\r\n\r\nunion  would  be  able to do, in  which  case  the\r\n\r\nsmaller  businessman would be put out of business.\r\n\r\nAnd the result of that would be that the worker in\r\n\r\nthat  small business would lose his job and  would\r\n\r\nbe  the  person most likely to suffer. It  is  for\r\n\r\nthis  reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  I  shall  be\r\n\r\nmoving an amendment to this clause later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the unions also did not like\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of sub-clause (3) of clause 18  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. That is a sub-clause which enables  an\r\n\r\nemployer  to  say to the Commissioner  for  Labour\r\n\r\nthat  the  workmen  in  his  undertaking  are  not\r\n\r\nmembers of the trade union which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclaims  to represent them; and it also enables  an\r\n\r\nemployer  to  say to the Commissioner  for  Labour\r\n\r\nthat even though his employees are represented  by\r\n\r\na particular trade union which claims to represent\r\n\r\nthem,  nevertheless, in his opinion,  he  believes\r\n\r\nthat his own employees do not desire that union to\r\n\r\nrepresent  them. Now, the unions were particularly\r\n\r\nunhappy  with clause 18 (3) (b) as it stands.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  now decided  that  it  will  keep\r\n\r\nclause 18 (3) (a), but delete clause 18 (3) (b) on\r\n\r\nthe  grounds  that if effect is given  to  it,  it\r\n\r\nwould  unduly  restrict the  activities  of  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and  would enable employers to  meddle  in\r\n\r\ntrade union affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another provision in the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich gave considerable concern to the unions  was\r\n\r\nclause  28  (b)  where  it is  provided  that  the\r\n\r\nPresident  of the Court should be given  the  last\r\n\r\nopportunity   to  try  to  effect  a  conciliation\r\n\r\nbetween  the parties before he decides to refer  a\r\n\r\ntrade dispute to arbitration. Mr Speaker, Sir, it\r\n\r\nwas  pointed out that it would be unwise to allow\r\n\r\nthe  President to be in a position where he  could\r\n\r\nconciliate and, at the same time, be the judge  of\r\n\r\na   Court  of  Arbitration.  In  the  process   of\r\n\r\nconciliation,   it  is  very   likely   that   the\r\n\r\nconciliator  forms an opinion  with  regard  to  a\r\n\r\ndispute. That being so, he might consider that the\r\n\r\nunion  is  either unreasonable in not agreeing  to\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of  the employer, or the  employer  is\r\n\r\nunreasonable in resisting the claims of the union,\r\n\r\nand, therefore, it would be unfair, after he forms\r\n\r\nsuch an opinion, to require him then to adjudicate\r\n\r\non the same issues as President of the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill also\r\n\r\nreferred earlier on to the provisions of clause 18\r\n\r\n(4)  and  clause 20 (b) of the Bill. You will  see\r\n\r\nthere,  Sir,  that the Minister has the  power  to\r\n\r\nstop the Commissioner from notifying the Registrar\r\n\r\nof  the  Court  that  a trade dispute  exists.  In\r\n\r\nclause  18  (4),  he  has  the  power  to  stop  a\r\n\r\nnotification reaching the. Registrar of the  Court\r\n\r\nwhere  the parties have refused to negotiate;  and\r\n\r\nin  clause  20  (b), he has the power  to  stop  a\r\n\r\nnotification reaching the Registrar of  the  Court\r\n\r\nwhere a deadlock has resulted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nduring  the  negotiations. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill  himself  has  proposed  an\r\n\r\namendment  in  this  part  of  the  Bill.  He  has\r\n\r\nsuggested that the Commissioner should be required\r\n\r\nto  notify the Court of a trade dispute where  the\r\n\r\nparties   have  refused  to  negotiate,  where   a\r\n\r\nnegotiation  has  broken  down,  and   where   the\r\n\r\nMinister has failed to conciliate after making  an\r\n\r\nattempt  to do so. Mr Speaker, Sir, in discussing\r\n\r\nthis clause with the unions, they pointed out that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  was, in fact, receding  from  its\r\n\r\nposition  with regard to a union being  given  the\r\n\r\nsole  right  to  opt to bring a  case  before  the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court as the employer would, under the\r\n\r\nParty's policy statement, be required to submit to\r\n\r\narbitration  if  the  employees  union   requested\r\n\r\narbitration. Mr Speaker, Sir, the difficulty  was\r\n\r\nto  reconcile  the bargaining position  of  unions\r\n\r\nwith the principle of compulsory arbitration.  The\r\n\r\nunions  have  a  right to threaten  to  use  their\r\n\r\ncollective strength during the bargaining process.\r\n\r\nThey might be able, by the mere fact that they are\r\n\r\nable  to  use this threat, to induce the employers\r\n\r\nto  reach  an agreement with them, and  they  felt\r\n\r\nthat  that position should be safeguarded for them\r\n\r\nin  this clause of the Bill. They recognised  also\r\n\r\nthat  it  was the Government's policy  to  promote\r\n\r\nindustrial peace with justice, and that being  so,\r\n\r\nthey  accepted the position that power  should  be\r\n\r\nplaced in the hands of the Minister to direct that\r\n\r\nany dispute, whether an ordinary trade dispute  or\r\n\r\na  dispute in an essential service, should be  put\r\n\r\nto  arbitration. For that reason, clause 28 (c) of\r\n\r\nthe Bill is to be amended as appears in the notice\r\n\r\nof amendments which the Government has given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the unions also had a fear\r\n\r\nthat   if   the  impression  gained  ground   that\r\n\r\narbitration was automatic, it was likely that all\r\n\r\nissues would be submitted to arbitration and  that\r\n\r\nthe  Court  would  be cluttered up  with  numerous\r\n\r\npending  issues.  And to that  extent,  the  whole\r\n\r\npolicy  of  the  Government  would  be  completely\r\n\r\nfrustrated.  It  was  for that  reason  that  they\r\n\r\nagreed that the Minister should have the final say\r\n\r\nas  to  whether a trade dispute should be  put  to\r\n\r\narbitration or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has\r\n\r\nalready expressed to this House the misgivings  of\r\n\r\nthe  unions  with  regard to  the  application  of\r\n\r\nclause  32  of this Bill which provides  that  the\r\n\r\nCourt  shall have regard not only to the  interest\r\n\r\nof  the  persons who are affected by the  dispute,\r\n\r\nbut  also to the interest of the community and  to\r\n\r\nthe  economy  of  the  State.  He  felt  that  the\r\n\r\nemployers would try to put this to their use.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in our policy statement,  we  have\r\n\r\nmade  it clear that when an Arbitration Court  was\r\n\r\nset up, it would be required to have due regard to\r\n\r\nthe  complexities  of our economy  and,  for  that\r\n\r\nreason,  we  have had to tell the unions  that  we\r\n\r\nfelt  that clause 32 is vitally necessary for  the\r\n\r\noperation  of  this  Bill.  But  we  have  made  a\r\n\r\nconcession. Instead of requiring the Court to have\r\n\r\nregard  to these matters, we have left it  to  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion of the Court to do so. The Court  will,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  be  fully  informed  of  the  position\r\n\r\nbefore making up its mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has\r\n\r\nalso  referred  to  the penal provisions  of  this\r\n\r\nBill.  We  have taken counsel with the unions  and\r\n\r\nafter considerable discussions the Government  has\r\n\r\nagreed  to  delete  the provisions  of  this  Bill\r\n\r\naffecting the deregistration of trade unions.  But\r\n\r\nthe Government has decided to retain the provision\r\n\r\nwhich  places  irresponsible trade  union  leaders\r\n\r\nunder  restriction against participation in  trade\r\n\r\nunion  activities if they are found guilty by  the\r\n\r\nPresident of the Arbitration Court of contempt  of\r\n\r\nthe  authority of the Court. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we\r\n\r\nourselves on the Government side have said that we\r\n\r\nhope  that  it will never be necessary  for  these\r\n\r\nprovisions ever to be implemented, and  that  with\r\n\r\nthe  experience gained from the operation of  this\r\n\r\nlaw and with goodwill on both sides, the tradition\r\n\r\nof  collective bargaining will be built up,  which\r\n\r\nwill  make it unnecessary for the penal provisions\r\n\r\nof  this law ever to be applied against any  trade\r\n\r\nunion leader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are other provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill which also gave considerable concern  to\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the  unions,  but  I  do  not\r\n\r\npropose to take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  much  time by referring to them,  because  the\r\n\r\nopportunity will be given to me to deal with these\r\n\r\nmisgivings  and fears when the Bill is dealt  with\r\n\r\nat the Committee stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have also had discussions\r\n\r\nwith  the Federation of Employers. They have  said\r\n\r\nin a very lengthy memorandum that they also do not\r\n\r\nlike  the  provisions  of  this  Bill.  They  have\r\n\r\nmisgivings  with  regard to certain  clauses,  and\r\n\r\nthey  frankly admit that they do not understand  a\r\n\r\nlot  of these clauses. Mr Speaker, Sir, they  are\r\n\r\nparticularly concerned with the clause in the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  denies a disputant a right of  appeal  from\r\n\r\nthe  decisions  of the Court of Arbitration.  They\r\n\r\nconsider  that  the  disputant has  a  fundamental\r\n\r\nright  of appeal, and they say that it might  very\r\n\r\nwell  be that the Court might make a mistake which\r\n\r\nwould   cause   considerable   damage   to   their\r\n\r\ninterests.  For  that reason they  have  suggested\r\n\r\nthat there should be an appeal from the decisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Arbitration Court to the ordinary Courts.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I pointed out, when I moved this\r\n\r\nBill,  that  the Court that will be set  up  under\r\n\r\nthis  law  is  not  a  Court  of  Judicature.  Its\r\n\r\nfunction will be to make an agreement for  parties\r\n\r\nwhere  they  fail to agree, and as I have  pointed\r\n\r\nout  earlier,  that  function  is  more  akin   to\r\n\r\ndelegated legislation; so that if there is  to  be\r\n\r\nan  appeal  from the decision of the  Court,  that\r\n\r\nappeal   must   lie   to  a  superior   Court   of\r\n\r\nArbitration; it cannot lie to the ordinary  Courts\r\n\r\nof Judicature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Federation of Employers\r\n\r\nalso  told  me  that they did not  understand  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of clause 55 of the Bill. That  clause\r\n\r\nis designed to ensure that either party may not be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  pick and choose the parts  that  they\r\n\r\nagree  to accept in any award. The Court  has  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  under  that clause to  say  to  either\r\n\r\nparty,  \"You  will either have the whole  of  that\r\n\r\naward  or  no  award at all.\" Sir,  after  a  long\r\n\r\ndiscussion  with the representatives of employers,\r\n\r\nthey  were satisfied that the Government was doing\r\n\r\nits   best  to  provide  to  both  employers   and\r\n\r\nemployees  of  their organisations  the  machinery\r\n\r\nwhereby disputes could be settled, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  otherwise result in strikes  and  lock-outs\r\n\r\nand   other  industrial action  which  could  cause\r\n\r\nconsiderable damage to the economy of our State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister just now\r\n\r\nhas given the House reasons why the Government has\r\n\r\ndecided  not  to  refer  this  Bill  to  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. As the Prime Minister has pointed  out,\r\n\r\nthere  is a lot of work yet to be done under  this\r\n\r\nBill-regulations will have to be made,  the  Court\r\n\r\nwill have to be set up, and we will have to get on\r\n\r\nwith  the job of making this Bill operate. And  it\r\n\r\nwould not do for us to spend our time arguing  the\r\n\r\nclauses  of  this  Bill in protracted  discussions\r\n\r\nbefore  a  Select Committee, and for  that  reason\r\n\r\nGovernment has decided to proceed with the  Second\r\n\r\nReading  and Committee stage of this Bill at  this\r\n\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee Friday, 12th February, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TRADE DISPUTES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.23 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the\r\n\r\nBill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, proposes certain\r\n\r\namendments to the Trade Disputes Ordinance,  which\r\n\r\nare  associated  with  the  Ordinance  called  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance. I have  given  the\r\n\r\nBill  its  full title, but I intend to move  at  a\r\n\r\nlater  stage certain amendments designed to delete\r\n\r\nthose parts of the Bill which would alter the  law\r\n\r\nrelating to strikes and lock-outs in the essential\r\n\r\nservices. In particular, I shall propose that  the\r\n\r\nparagraphs  in  page 2 of the  Bill  dealing  with\r\n\r\nstrikes  and  lock-outs in essential  services  be\r\n\r\ndeleted,  and  that clause 7 be omitted  from  the\r\n\r\nBill.  I  do not, therefore, comment now on  those\r\n\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the Bill is to add to the\r\n\r\ntypes  of strikes and lock-outs which are  already\r\n\r\nillegal - strikes and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlock-outs  which  are  in  furtherance  of  trade\r\n\r\ndisputes  of  which  the  Industrial  Arbitration\r\n\r\nCourt  has cognizance. Such strikes and lock-outs\r\n\r\nare  in essence directed against the Court. Quite\r\n\r\nobviously, the  Court cannot deal  in  a  proper\r\n\r\natmosphere  with  issues  in  dispute,  if  those\r\n\r\nissues  are the subject of direct action  outside\r\n\r\nthe  Court. The right to strike during bargaining\r\n\r\nstages  are left unimpaired, but when  a  dispute\r\n\r\ngoes to Court, direct pressure should cease. Sir,\r\n\r\n\"you cannot have recourse to law and recourse  to\r\n\r\nforce  at the same time\" is a simple proposition.\r\n\r\nWhen  an  award is made, the Court has performed\r\n\r\nits  task.  Of course, not every award will  give\r\n\r\nemployees  everything they would like. Indeed  it\r\n\r\nis  sometimes said that it can never be  possible\r\n\r\nto  give employees everything they would like  to\r\n\r\nhave,  but  the  system requires  that  employees\r\n\r\nshould  work  in accordance with  the  award.  It\r\n\r\ntherefore  requires that it should not be  lawful\r\n\r\nto  incite  them  not to do so.  The  Bill  gives\r\n\r\neffect  to this in the new clause 3 (c) which  it\r\n\r\nis proposed to insert in the principal Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the Bill to this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and\r\n\r\ncommitted to a Committee of the whole Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee Friday, 12th February, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOSPITALS BOARD (REPEAL) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.27 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hospitals Board was established to determine\r\n\r\nfees  on  condition  that the Minister  concerned\r\n\r\nconfirmed them earlier, and to receive such fees.\r\n\r\nAmong  its  functions, the Board is to  determine\r\n\r\nthe income approved by the Government.

However,   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government  is  now  issuing  Treasury\r\n\r\nBills,  and  the  Singapore  Government  similarly\r\n\r\nintends  to  issue  Treasury  Bills  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is considered that the time has\r\n\r\nnow  come  for Treasury Bills to be brought  under\r\n\r\ncontrol, and this precisely is the main purpose of\r\n\r\nthis  amendment Bill now under consideration. When\r\n\r\namended,  the  Exchange  Control  Ordinance   will\r\n\r\nconform more closely to the United Kingdom Control\r\n\r\nAct of 1947.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is also intended to effect an amendment\r\n\r\nto  subsection  (5) of section 2 of the  principal\r\n\r\nOrdinance  which contains a reference  to  British\r\n\r\nsubjects.

If such rooms are\r\n\r\nthen  used  for  the purposes of prostitution,  no\r\n\r\naction can be taken against the hotel keeper under\r\n\r\nthe  present law. The Bill seeks to change the law\r\n\r\nby  providing that a tenant, occupier or person in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  any premises who lets the premises  or\r\n\r\nany   part  thereof  shall,  notwithstanding  such\r\n\r\nletting,  be guilty of an offence if the  premises\r\n\r\nor  any  part thereof are or is used as a brothel,\r\n\r\nunless he proves that he has no knowledge that the\r\n\r\npremises or such part thereof are or is used as  a\r\n\r\nbrothel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where premises are used as a brothel, the Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  that the tenant, occupier or  person  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  the  premises shall be  guilty  of  an\r\n\r\noffence, unless he proves that he has no knowledge\r\n\r\nof  the  use  of  the premises as a  brothel.  The\r\n\r\nowners  or  agents of the owners of  premises  are\r\n\r\nonly   liable  if  it  is  shown  that  they  have\r\n\r\nknowledge of the use of the premises as a brothel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"brothel\" has been amended so\r\n\r\nas  to  include not only a house or place but  any\r\n\r\nportion of any house or place, and also to make it\r\n\r\nunnecessary to prove contemporaneous use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  premises for the purposes of prostitution\r\n\r\nby   two   women   or  girls.

Members can see from the explanatory\r\n\r\nstatement,  this winding up Bill seeks  to  repeal\r\n\r\nthe  War  Savings Certificates Ordinance of  1940.\r\n\r\nThe  principal Ordinance was passed on 30th August,\r\n\r\n1940,  to  authorise the Governor of  the  Straits\r\n\r\nSettlements to raise a loan from the public  as  a\r\n\r\ngift to the British Government for the prosecution\r\n\r\nof  the  Second  World War. This was  to  be  done\r\n\r\nthrough  the  sale of War Savings Certificates  in\r\n\r\nunits   of  $15  each,  and  the  Government   was\r\n\r\nauthorised to sell up to $20 million worth of such\r\n\r\ncertificates.  However, only $9,724,440  worth  of\r\n\r\ncertificates  were sold from 1st September,  1940,\r\n\r\nto   15th   February,   1942.   These   $15   unit\r\n\r\ncertificates  had a redemption  value  of  $20  on\r\n\r\nmaturity  of  10  years from the  date  of  issue.\r\n\r\nCompound interest at 3 per cent per year was  paid\r\n\r\non   certificates   which  were  redeemed   before\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmaturity.  The  latest balance sheet  as  at  31st\r\n\r\nDecember  1958,  shows that the biggest  liability\r\n\r\nitem   is   a  sum  of  $359,436  outstanding   to\r\n\r\npurchasers  of savings certificates  as  repayment\r\n\r\nfor  principal sums and payment of interest  sums.\r\n\r\nOn  balance, however, there is a favourable credit\r\n\r\nof $424,547.30 on the surplus and deficit account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains provisions which are largely\r\n\r\nprocedural. For instance, clause 5 (1) of the Bill\r\n\r\nprovides   that  all  outstanding  principal   and\r\n\r\ninterest  payments due on unredeemed  certificates\r\n\r\nshall  be  settled  within six  months  after  the\r\n\r\ncoming into operation of the Ordinance out of  the\r\n\r\nassets  of  the  War Savings Certificates  Sinking\r\n\r\nFund.

Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Party\r\n\r\nwhich I represent, I am taking this opportunity to\r\n\r\nconvey   some   of   its  views   concerning   the\r\n\r\nconstitution  of  trade unions in  my  adjournment\r\n\r\nspeech  in  this Assembly. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ntime has come for us to draw the attention of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to the fact that amendments  should  be\r\n\r\nmade  to the constitution of trade unions  to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that  all  the  personnel  managing  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and  labour  unions must  be  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all  know,  we\r\n\r\nhave discussed today at great length the enactment\r\n\r\nof   trade   union  laws  in  order  to   maintain\r\n\r\nindustrial peace. As we already have our own  flag\r\n\r\nand  our own national song, we feel that the  time\r\n\r\nhas  come  for  consideration to be given  to  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  Singapore to  participate  in  trade\r\n\r\nunion  and  labour union affairs. We certainly  do\r\n\r\nnot  like  to see persons who are non-citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore upsetting the livelihood of our workers.\r\n\r\nWe wish for peace, progress and prosperity for our\r\n\r\nState.  At  this  moment, we have  representatives\r\n\r\nelected  by the people who, I am sure, are capable\r\n\r\nof effecting a change to the constitution of trade\r\n\r\nunions so that only citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  play a leading part in trade unions.  We  are\r\n\r\ngoing  ahead  with  our plans to  make  Malay  the\r\n\r\nnational  language in the future.  The  matter  on\r\n\r\nwhich  I am speaking is of only a minor character,\r\n\r\nand  I  am  sure the Government will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nresolve it without much waste of time. We do  wish\r\n\r\nthat  citizens  of  Singapore should  be  given  a\r\n\r\ngreater opportunity to lead in the field of  trade\r\n\r\nunionism. If possible, we do not wish citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya to take an active part in\r\n\r\nour   trade   union  affairs.  Citizens   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation   of   Malaya  are   citizens   of   an\r\n\r\nindependent State, and we should not give them  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to play a leading role in  our  trade\r\n\r\nunion   activities.  We  must   also   take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration the fact that Commonwealth  citizens\r\n\r\nshould  also be excluded from taking part  in  our\r\n\r\ninternal affairs. The time has now come for us  to\r\n\r\ntake  part  in affairs which affect us.  In  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  Sir,  I hope the  Government  will\r\n\r\ngive  consideration  to the points  which  I  have\r\n\r\nraised  with  a view to framing a new constitution\r\n\r\nwhereby  we  can  give opportunities  to  our  own\r\n\r\npeople -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether\r\n\r\nthe  hon. Member is advocating legislation. If  he\r\n\r\nis,  then this is not the time to do so. He  is  a\r\n\r\nlegislator and has an opportunity of introducing a\r\n\r\nBill if necessary. An adjournment speech must  not\r\n\r\nsuggest legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo  not wish to introduce legislation during  this\r\n\r\nperiod when I have been permitted by you to speak.\r\n\r\nI   am   merely  drawing  the  attention  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  what I have just  said  about  the\r\n\r\npersonnel  in our trade unions, in the  hope  that\r\n\r\nthey can concede to the wishes of the majority  or\r\n\r\nthe majority of the citizens of Singapore. In this\r\n\r\nmatter  relating  to  the  constitution  of  trade\r\n\r\nunions   or  labour  unions,  we  hope  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  take  a  serious  view  of   the\r\n\r\npersonnel who play a leading role in trade unions,\r\n\r\nespecially in Service trade unions. We can see  in\r\n\r\nthese  trade  unions that their  leaders  are  not\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore. Although the money paid  to\r\n\r\nthe Service employees is not borne by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis Government but by the British Government,  we\r\n\r\nall  know  that  the  majority  of  these  Service\r\n\r\nemployees   are   Singapore   citizens.   It   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   desirable  that   the   citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore should be given an opportunity  to  take\r\n\r\nover  the  responsibility of running their  unions\r\n\r\nwhen  they  come  together  during  their  general\r\n\r\nmeetings,  and that future legislation  should  be\r\n\r\npassed   by   this  Government  to  this   effect.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  with  such  encouragement   from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   I  believe  that  the  citizens   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be grateful to the Government  and\r\n\r\nthat  they  will support the Government  in  other\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, Mr Speaker, Sir, we do\r\n\r\nnot  wish  to see people, who have not  taken  out\r\n\r\ncitizenship papers, take part in running our trade\r\n\r\nunion  affairs.  What  is the  purpose  of  giving\r\n\r\nopportunities  to  citizens of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya to play an important role in our unions? We\r\n\r\nare  fit  and  capable  of administering  our  own\r\n\r\naffairs. If there are persons in these unions with\r\n\r\ninfluence  or ulterior motives, then I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government should take a more active interest\r\n\r\nin  such affairs. These may be affairs relating to\r\n\r\nthe  security and peace of our State,  because  we\r\n\r\nknow that undesirable elements are waiting for  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to make use of the trade  unions  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own ends with a view to grabbing  power  in\r\n\r\nthe  next  elections.  The members  of  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions could be influenced ideologically by  these\r\n\r\nundesirable elements. If such a state  of  affairs\r\n\r\nexists - and the Government is fully aware of this - I\r\n\r\nthink the time has come, Mr Speaker, Sir, for  us\r\n\r\nto  take appropriate action. We do not wish to see\r\n\r\nsuch  persons interfering in our domestic affairs,\r\n\r\nbecause  these  are  affairs  which  concern   the\r\n\r\nworkers  and their families. If there are  persons\r\n\r\nwho  are non-citizens of Singapore taking part  in\r\n\r\nunion activities which would result in hardship to\r\n\r\nthe  workers  and their families, the consequences\r\n\r\nwill  be  very serious. This will not only  affect\r\n\r\nthe  workers  but  also their families  and  their\r\n\r\ndependants. But the main thing, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nis  this - let us make an effort to get rid of those\r\n\r\npersons  who  do  not wish to become  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore or who are not brave enough to show\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir undivided loyalty to this State. Our aim  is\r\n\r\nto   protect  the  interest  of  the  citizens  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. If such undesirable persons  are  given\r\n\r\nan opportunity to play a leading role in our trade\r\n\r\nunion  activities, Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe  we\r\n\r\nwill  be confronted with bigger problems, because,\r\n\r\nas  I have said earlier, this can be considered as\r\n\r\nan  external threat which is in conflict with  our\r\n\r\nown  interest.  If such a threat exists,  it  will\r\n\r\nlead to disaster and the name of our State will be\r\n\r\ndamaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will look into this matter\r\n\r\nso  that we can restrict such persons who are non-citizens of Singapore - irrespective of whether they\r\n\r\nare citizens of the Federation of Malaya or of the\r\n\r\nUnited   Kingdom   and  Colonies   or   of   other\r\n\r\nindependent States -  from playing a leading part  in\r\n\r\ntrade unionism in Singapore. These persons have no\r\n\r\nfranchise and they are not citizens of our  State.\r\n\r\nI  hope the Government will take a serious view of\r\n\r\nthis  matter  so  that  we  can  fulfil  our  main\r\n\r\nobligation, that is, to help our own citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kernbangan that the Government\r\n\r\nis at present giving very serious consideration to\r\n\r\nintroducing a new Trade Union Ordinance to  repeal\r\n\r\nthe  present  Ordinance, and  to  give  effect  to\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy with regard to trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.

I  do  not propose to mention  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  the  names of unions which  restrict  their\r\n\r\nmembership to persons of a certain race.
