But I have explained  that  in\r\n\r\nmost  of  the countries quoted by Members of the Opposition, there is  only  one\r\n\r\nnationality, one culture and one religion. We should not forget that the  people\r\n\r\nof  our  country  are different in race and religion. Therefore,  the  basis  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy which should be practised here is to respect the views of all sections\r\n\r\nof  the population. If we ignore this basic principle of democracy, then it will\r\n\r\nbe a death-blow to democracy in our country.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, to return to the question which will be posed to the electorate; let us say that it will be on merger. All are unanimously agreed that merger must come. The question to be answered is what kind of merger. We must be aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government have been elected by the people and that  they  have  left\r\n\r\ntheir  destiny in the hands of the Government. Therefore, the Government  in  im\r\n\r\nplementing  the  task entrusted to them must always bear in  mind  that  the  in\r\n\r\nterests  of  the  people come first. The Government have on  many  occasions  re\r\n\r\niterated  that we must respect the views of all sections of the people.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition will also respect the rights of all sections of the  people.  We\r\n\r\nshould  not think in terms of what we want. For instance, yesterday, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Jalan Kayu quoted the example of buying an article in a shop and that if the\r\n\r\narticle  offered to us is unacceptable we go to the next shop. We  can  go  from\r\n\r\nSungei Road to Robinson, Sir, but there is a difference in the price. The prices\r\n\r\nof  articles in Sungei Road vary very much from those in Robinson. The price  of\r\n\r\nan  article depends on its quality. So it is with merger. If we want a super mer\r\n\r\nger,  then we must be prepared for sacrifices. But instead of fighting  for  the\r\n\r\nrights  which  we are enjoying now, we are asking for other rights.  As  I  said\r\n\r\npreviously,  our wives will remain our wives. But we should not  be  asking  for\r\n\r\nother people's wives. If the Federation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya  can be likened to a shop and if the products sold in that shop  are  not\r\n\r\nsuitable,  where  shall we go? We do not want Singapore and  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  to  be a second Palestine. We must admit that this referendum  is  on  a\r\n\r\nnational  issue and not on a political issue. In facing this national issue,  we\r\n\r\nmust  be realistic. We must respect one another's views and rights. We must  not\r\n\r\nmake  this  Referendum Bill an issue for winning the next election. We  must  be\r\n\r\nfully aware of this as we are the elected representatives of the people in whose\r\n\r\nhands  the people have put heir destiny. Therefore, Mr Speaker, in facing  this\r\n\r\nissue, we oppose the proposition that only one question is to be put to the elec\r\n\r\ntorate. We must submit a number of reasonable questions because we are concerned\r\n\r\nwith  merger.  There must be agreement on both sides and the view of  the  other\r\n\r\nside  should be taken into consideration as well. If I take my child to a  shop,\r\n\r\nhe  might  want to buy expensive articles. But I must first find out  whether  I\r\n\r\nhave enough money in my pocket before I can buy them for him. So, if what I have\r\n\r\njust  said  materialises, then Singapore and the Federation  will  be  a  second\r\n\r\nPalestine.  There  will  be no peace between these two  countries.  'Therefore,\r\n\r\npolitical  leaders, in facing this problem, must be sober in  the  interests  of\r\n\r\nnational unity and peace for the country.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say\r\n\r\nsomething on this disgusting National Referendum Bill. It does not look  like  a\r\n\r\nnational Referendum Bill. It is something like a repressive Bill. It does not re\r\n\r\nally  reflect  the views of the people. This Bill can only force the  people  to\r\n\r\nchoose two unacceptable alternatives. The people in the whole of Singapore  know\r\n\r\nthat this Bill is a very undemocratic Bill. The Government have put on the cloak\r\n\r\nof  democracy.  But,  as  a  matter of fact, they are selling  the  contents  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy. Therefore, this Bill is a plot.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have reason to believe that this national Referendum Bill\r\n\r\nhas  been  created  by some of the leaders in the P.A.P. in order  to  trap  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  hope  that the Back-Benchers of the Government  Party  will  come\r\n\r\nforward to uphold justice and the people's democratic rights.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, now let me come back to the clause. The clause which we have been discussing is one of the most important clauses. Mr Speaker, Sir, if the\r\n\r\namendment  proposed by the Opposition is not acceptable by the Government,  then\r\n\r\nit only proves that the Party in power does not dare to face the people. It also\r\n\r\nproves that the P.A.P. Government has lost its own confidence in the White Paper\r\n\r\nmerger  proposals. Mr Speaker. Sir, regarding the questions why the leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. have to go back on their word, why they want to distort facts,  why\r\n\r\nthey dare not bring up their White Paper proposals for the people to decide, let\r\n\r\nus  see  whether  the  people want their proposals or  not.  Mr  Speaker,  this\r\n\r\nquestion  has been debated in this House for a long time, because the  Party  in\r\n\r\npower itself knows that its own White Paper proposals are not in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe  views  of  the majority of the people. If the Government put forward  these\r\n\r\nproposals they are sure to be rejected by the people. Therefore, the leaders  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  shamelessly go back on their word. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the  Gov\r\n\r\nernment  leaders have decided to pose two questions to the people for  their  de\r\n\r\ncision.  This is clear to everyone and we have spoken at great length  on  this.\r\n\r\nBut  originally the Government wanted to pose only one question,  but  now  they\r\n\r\nhave  decided to pose two questions. The P.A.P. leaders are very clever  people.\r\n\r\nThey can think out all sorts of devices. What is the device? It is that they try\r\n\r\nto  create  confusion over the title of the Bill. The Government has  altered  a\r\n\r\nspecific  Bill for the specific question of merger to a general Bill. This  Bill\r\n\r\nhas  been  changed by the Government into a general Bill, so that the  Party  in\r\n\r\npower  can  pose one, two, three or four questions to the people.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  because the Government have changed the fundamental nature of  this  Bill,\r\n\r\ntherefore  they  are trying to quote instances from other countries  to  justify\r\n\r\ntheir stand . This  is meant only to confuse the vision of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npeople.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, let me quote some examples  to  show  you  how  the\r\n\r\nGovernment are trying to confuse the people's vision. This is a copy of the  Sin\r\n\r\nChew  Jit  Poh  of  7th of June in the local field. A speech  by  the  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Prime Minister was published on this page in which he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Here the Government has decided to hold a national Referendum on the question\r\n\r\nof  merger. However, we must be clear that this National Referendum Bill is  not\r\n\r\nonly  meant for this merger issue; it is not only applicable to a referendum  on\r\n\r\nthe merger issue, but it is also intended to be applied for future referenda  on\r\n\r\nother issues.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And  in  discussing this Bill the question of merger was mentioned. This  is  be\r\n\r\ncause it is necessary to cite examples. It is not a central question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that this Bill was brought up because the Gov\r\n\r\nernment  wanted  to carry out its White Paper merger proposals,  but  today  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  try  to  describe  it  as a general National  Referendum  Bill.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment at the same time have inserted certain provisions into this  Bill  in\r\n\r\norder to distort it: that is to say, if there is only one question posed to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  then  it means a waste of public money. This is said by  the  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Prime Minister. He is trying to distort the spirit of this Bill\r\n\r\ninto  something else. Now, let me quote him. This was on the 9th of this  month.\r\n\r\nIt  was published in the local news, the Sin Chew Jit Poh. Mr Speaker, Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthis article he said about the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is someone who mentioned two examples. One example is the question of\r\n\r\nMalay  as  the official language. Everybody agrees that this should be  so.  But\r\n\r\nwhen Malay is made the national language, evervbody agrees that it should be the\r\n\r\nofficial language. But there might be a divergency of views on when this  should\r\n\r\nbe  implemented. Therefore, the Government should seek the views of the  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Government will have to ask the people  whether  it  should  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  in  5  years  or  7 years or 10 years.  The  second  example  is  a\r\n\r\nhypothetical example, and that is the control of toddy shops. This example shows\r\n\r\nthat  if  only  one question is posed and if the answer requires only  'yes'  or\r\n\r\n'no',  it  might become very restrictive. These two examples show  that  if  the\r\n\r\nanswer  is a straightforward 'yes' or 'no', it will not effectively reflect  the\r\n\r\nviews of the people, If in the national Referendum we provide only one question,\r\n\r\nthen the Government has to hold 3\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nor  4  national referenda and each national referendum will cost about $400,000.\r\n\r\nWhy  should  we spend so much money unnecessarily to pose only one question  and\r\n\r\nthe answer is 'yes' or 'no'? Why should we do that and spend so much money?'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from this speech we can see very clearly that the Government\r\n\r\nhave  put  in an entirely different question in this Bill. This is very  unfair.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, we can see the P.A.P. Government are trying to twist the Bill\r\n\r\ninto  something  else  and it becomes something else. That  is  why  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment want to turn a specific Bill for the merger question into  a  general\r\n\r\nBill. Mr Speaker. Sir, I want to point out to you that the Government have lost\r\n\r\ntheir  confidence  in their own merger proposals but they are  not  prepared  to\r\n\r\nabandon  them. The Government have put their own interests above  those  of  the\r\n\r\npeople. They are trying to achieve their ends without regard to the means.  They\r\n\r\ndo not care whether it is justifiable or reasonable and they do not care whether\r\n\r\nit is democratic or not.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now we listened to the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister when he rebutted a remark by the Opposition. The example  quoted\r\n\r\nby  the Opposition of buying things is merely to show that we have a freedom  of\r\n\r\nchoice  when  we buy things. But what we buy must be something which  we  really\r\n\r\nwant  to have, but the things which are offered by the Government are not wanted\r\n\r\nby  the people. The Government themselves know that they have no faith in  their\r\n\r\nown  goods.  Only the P.A.P. Government are anxious to have this  thing  because\r\n\r\nthey try to make use of this method to salvage their political fortunes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance in his speech yesterday made many\r\n\r\nabusive,  distorted and smear remarks about the Opposition. He said the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and  Mr  Marshall have maintained that the right to  say  no  is  the\r\n\r\nfundamental  and basic right of the people. The right to say no is the  fundamen\r\n\r\ntal right of human beings, but the P.A.P. would not like the people to have such\r\n\r\na right. From this you can see why we do not understand what the Minister for\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nFinance has said. The example should be taken to mean to refer to the Government\r\n\r\nthemselves.  That would be more proper. The Government want to  have  a  certain\r\n\r\ntype  of  referendum in order to deprive the people of their democratic  rights.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  you  can see that the Government - the Party in power - are  preparing  for  their outrage. They are not a clean Party. That  is  why  they  are\r\n\r\ntrying to deprive the people of the right to say no and to force them to say yes\r\n\r\nin order to meet their own desires and wishes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to note two points. The first is I want to touch upon the purpose\r\n\r\nof the amendment. Later on he said everything was in a mess.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to avail myself of this chance to reason with this muddle-headed Minister for Finance. The purpose of our proposing this amendment is very simple because we want the Government to pose only one question, to ask\r\n\r\nthe  people  whether  they  want the Government's White  Paper  on  merger.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  not  try to confuse the people  by  setting  more  than  one\r\n\r\nquestion. That is the purpose of our amendment, but our particular Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  of  Singapore  up to now has not understood  this,  and  that  is  very\r\n\r\npitiful. I hope he will not avoid our questions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has also touched upon another point, namely,\r\n\r\n\"that  the Barisan Sosialis is now in a quagmire.\" That is what he said. I  will\r\n\r\nnot  touch  on this point. He said, \"Let me straightforwardly say that  we  will\r\n\r\nvery  easily  frame the question on this issue whether you want to  accept  this\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper merger. And the answer can he 'Yes' or 'No'. If the answer is 'No'.\r\n\r\nif you prefer this one to the other one, you can have what you want from the two\r\n\r\nalternatives.\"  I can rebut him on this point. You can see that the  P.A.P.  Gov\r\n\r\nernment  are very worried. They are now struggling very hard to save themselves.\r\n\r\nBut I will say this: if the P.A.P. will not change and try to improve themselves\r\n\r\nand  make  things  better  for  all, then their  struggle  will  only  end  with\r\n\r\nthemselves dead.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another question - the last question - which is a true\r\n\r\nquestion. Here it says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The true question is not \"Yes\" or \"No\" to merger hut whether the Communists\r\n\r\nand their stooges will have the chance to pretend to have complete merger and to\r\n\r\nsabotage the national referendum.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this question should be explained in this way. The true\r\n\r\nquestion should be one that would require \"Yes\" or \"No\", it is not a question of\r\n\r\nwhether  the Communists have any chance to sabotage the referendum.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthemselves are the culprits. They are trying to wreck the national referendum by\r\n\r\nmeans  of this Bill because they do not have confidence in themselves. They  are\r\n\r\nnow trying to destroy the national referendum and yet they say others are trying\r\n\r\nto  wreck  it.  This  is very improper.

Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we on the\r\n\r\nGovernment side have all along maintained that this Bill is a general Referendum\r\n\r\nBill  and  that it would be improper to incorporate in it a provision  like  the\r\n\r\namendment  proposed which would have the effect of limiting  the  scope  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  The Member for Anson argued that if it was clearly the intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to use this Bill for the purpose of holding a referendum on  merger.\r\n\r\nwould  the  Government  not  have  acted more appropriately  and  fairly  if  it\r\n\r\nintroduced  a specific Referendum Bill to hold a referendum on merger?  He  said\r\n\r\nthat  this  was done in all countries where referenda were held.  Is  there  any\r\n\r\nmerit  in  this  argument? All Bills which deal with referenda matters,  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  called  general Referendum Bills or specific Referendum  Bills,  must\r\n\r\nprovide  the  machinery  whereby questions can be put  to  the  electorate,  and\r\n\r\nwhereby  the  choice  of  the electorate can be ascertained  through  the  usual\r\n\r\nelectoral procedures. The only difference between a Bill to hold a referendum on\r\n\r\na  specific issue and a general Referendum Bill is that in the former  the  ques\r\n\r\ntions  are framed as a clause in the Bill. In other words, the participation  of\r\n\r\nthe Legislative Assembly is sought by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the framing of the question or questions before they are  put  to\r\n\r\nthe electorate. When the Opposition was seeking to create a song and dance about\r\n\r\nthis,  you  yourself, Sir, pointed out to them that the remedy lay in their  own\r\n\r\nhands.  You indicated that there was nothing to stop the Opposition from tabling\r\n\r\na motion in the Legislative Assembly on the question or questions that should be\r\n\r\nput  to  the  electorate in the referendum on merger. This you  suggested  would\r\n\r\nprovoke a debate and, by recourse to the normal constitutional machinery open to\r\n\r\nall  Members of this Assembly, the Assembly would be able to debate the  matter,\r\n\r\nand  the participation of the Legislative Assembly would in this way be obtained\r\n\r\nin the framing of the questions that would he put to the electorate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party have since taken your advice in\r\n\r\nthis  matter and have tabled a motion indicating the sort of question they would\r\n\r\nwant  to  he  put to the electorate in a referendum on merger, so  that  it  can\r\n\r\nreadily be seen that there is very little substance in the distinction that  the\r\n\r\nopposition  sought to draw between a general Referendum Bill  and  a  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill on a specific issue.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Select Committee when the amendment proposed by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson seeking to limit the scope of this Bill was under consideration, we on the\r\n\r\nGovernment side gave very serious consideration to the proposition contained  in\r\n\r\nthis  amendment. The proposition was this: if there was to be what  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis and Workers' Party considered to be a fair referendum, there must be in\r\n\r\ncluded  in the Bill a provision that there must be only one question, that  this\r\n\r\nquestion  must be limited to a single issue, and that the electorate  should  be\r\n\r\ninvited to say \"Yes\" or \"No\". We had therefore to consider whether there was any\r\n\r\nmerit  in this proposition. We began by testing this proposition from the common\r\n\r\nsense point of view.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was you, Mr Speaker, who suggested the case of toddy shops. You said that\r\n\r\nin a referendum on toddy shops, it was\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npossible  that  two  or  more  questions could be put  to  the  electorate.  The\r\n\r\nelectorate could be asked such questions as:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Should all toddy shops be closed?;\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Should only Government toddy be sold in shops?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Minister for Finance then said that if a referendum was to be held  on  the\r\n\r\nquestion  as  to  when  Malay should be adopted as the  official  language,  the\r\n\r\nelectorate could be asked to indicate in two questions whether it should be in 5\r\n\r\nor 10 years.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were seriously considering the merits of this proposition, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  in his usual way became very frivolous about the matter.  He  asked,\r\n\r\n\"What about a referendum on taxi girls?\" I replied: \"What about a referendum  on\r\n\r\nsmoking?\"  As  time went on, he became more and more frivolous,  more  and  more\r\n\r\nexcited, and went on to talk about referenda on such questions as the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Do you prefer to heat your wife or do you prefer to beat your mother?\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Then you, Mr Speaker, interposed and said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What about the question, 'Would you like to beat or list your wife?'\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Then the Member for Anson went on further to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What about a referendum on this question, 'Would you like to shoot or fist\r\n\r\nyour wife?'\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a clear indication that trouble is brewing in the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson's matrimonial household. I have no doubt that when  his  good\r\n\r\nlady comes to know that such serious propositions have come from the lips of the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson himself, she will have very good reason to seek the protection\r\n\r\nof  the police almost immediately. I know, Sir, that the Member for Anson  is  a\r\n\r\nvery  able  lawyer  and that it is part of his training, for which  he  receives\r\n\r\nhandsome rewards, to interpret unlawful acts in a favourable light. In order  to\r\n\r\nget  back  to a serious note, I told him that we on our side were most concerned\r\n\r\nwith  lawful  propositions and suggested that it would be more  worth  while  to\r\n\r\nconsider the questions that could be put in a referendum on smoking.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has been said by the Opposition that instead of treating this Bill\r\n\r\nseriously,  we  on  the Government side have been talking  about  referendum  on\r\n\r\npiddling  matters like toddy shops and smoking. I do not think that the  records\r\n\r\nwill support such a charge.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we nevertheless felt that in spite of the eccentricities of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson,  the  question  that  he posed in  his  amendment  required  serious\r\n\r\nconsideration and, for this reason, we proceeded to find out whether there  were\r\n\r\nany  precedents which support his proposition and whether it is true that  if  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  is  to  be held on an important constitutional issue,  we  would  be\r\n\r\nacting  unfairly  and unjustly to the electorate if we were not  to  accept  the\r\n\r\nproposition  contained  in  his amendment. In support  of  the  proposition,  we\r\n\r\nascertained that it was true that referenda had, in fact, been held limited to a\r\n\r\nsingle  question  where the voter was asked to say yes or no  in  the  following\r\n\r\ncountries in the past. For example:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Western Australia in 1933, on the question whether Western Australia\r\n\r\nshould secede from the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. France in 1958, to approve a new constitution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. New Zealand in 1959 -[Interruption].\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>I  will deal with that. Be patient about it. New Zealand in 1959, whether or not\r\n\r\nthe  electorate supported the introduction of compulsory military training. Here\r\n\r\nthe  elector  was not asked to say yes or no, but to strike out the proposal  he\r\n\r\ndid not support, which was much the same thing as saying yes or no.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> I vote\r\n\r\nfor/I vote against.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> New Zealand, you strike out one.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes or no.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Jamaica?

The examples are the two referenda held in Newfoundland in\r\n\r\nJune and July 1958.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T.

It was stipulated that if any of the questions put did\r\n\r\nnot  receive an overall majority, the question which received the lowest  number\r\n\r\nof  votes in the first referendum would be dropped, and a second referendum held\r\n\r\non  the  two remaining questions. As in the first referendum, no single question\r\n\r\nreceived an overall majority, a second referendum had to be held.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next examples we found were on referenda held in Australia and New Zealand\r\n\r\non  the  local licensing laws. These precedents established that it was quite  a\r\n\r\nnormal  thing  in  Australia and New Zealand for referenda to be  held  on  such\r\n\r\nquestions as the hours during which premises selling intoxicating liquor  should\r\n\r\nbe  opened  and  whether particular areas should be prohibited or non-prohibited\r\n\r\nareas for the sale of intoxicating liquor. Precedents also established that when\r\n\r\nsuch  referenda were held, it was usual for two or more questions to be  put  to\r\n\r\nthe electorate and for the electorate to he invited to make a choice of one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next example was the referendum held in the Cameroons. The Prime Minister\r\n\r\ndrew public attention to this referendum in a recent public forum on merger.  In\r\n\r\nthis  referendum, two questions were put to the electorate of  North  and  South\r\n\r\nCameroons,  which were trust territories administered by the British Government.\r\n\r\nThe  people  in each of these two territories were asked to decide whether  they\r\n\r\nwanted  to  join the independent Republic of the Cameroons, which was  a  former\r\n\r\nFrench colony which had become\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nindependent, or whether they wanted to join the Federation of Nigeria, which had\r\n\r\nbecome independent. Each voter was given a ballot paper which he had to place in\r\n\r\nwhichever of the two ballot boxes which corresponded to his choice, namely,  the\r\n\r\nbox  marked to correspond with the choice of joining the Federation of  Nigeria,\r\n\r\nor  the box marked to correspond with the choice of joining the Republic of  the\r\n\r\nCameroons.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after a study of the precedents, it occurred to us that there was a close\r\n\r\nanalogy  between the procedure adopted in referenda where two or more  questions\r\n\r\nwere put to the electorate, and where the elector was invited to choose one, and\r\n\r\nthe normal procedure that is followed in a general election or by-election.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> On a point of elucidation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will give way.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Can the Minister indicate the number of countries that he has quoted\r\n\r\nso far where in the referenda, irrespective of the number of questions posed - two\r\n\r\nor three or four questions\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- the basic right of a voter to either accept, reject or abstain was denied?

He went on to say that the analogy  was  false\r\n\r\nbecause  we were, in fact, saying that in general elections, we do not permit  a\r\n\r\nnegative  reply and the voter must say yes. This was, in his view, an inaccurate\r\n\r\nstatement  of the position. His argument was that in a general election  or  by-election, the elector could put in a blank ballot paper. This was denied to  him\r\n\r\nunder  clause 29 of the Bill which provides that where a ballot is  unmarked  or\r\n\r\nuncertain,  the voter is deemed to have accepted or to be willing to accept  the\r\n\r\ndecision of the Legislative Assembly on the matter referred in the referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that except in the case of the referendum held in the Cameroons.\r\n\r\nwhere  two  or  more questions were put to the electorate and  the  elector  was\r\n\r\ninvited  to  make a choice of one, the elector was allowed to  put  in  a  blank\r\n\r\nballot  paper  if he wished to do so.

Let us look and see if there is any  merit  in\r\n\r\nthis  submission. I have already mentioned the referendum held in the  Cameroons\r\n\r\nwhere  the  elector  was  asked to answer one of two  questions  and  where  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  adopted was that he should put his ballot paper in whichever  of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  ballot boxes which corresponded with his choice. This was a referendum held\r\n\r\nunder  the  supervision of the United Nations. In this referendum, the procedure\r\n\r\nadopted  can  be assumed to be unimpeachable. Yet in the procedure adopted,  the\r\n\r\nvoter  was  not given the opportunity of putting in a blank ballot paper.  Where\r\n\r\nthen is there any merit in the Member for Anson's argument that if an elector is\r\n\r\nnot given an opportunity of saying no, by putting in a blank ballot, then he  is\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  his  fundamental right to say no and the whole  procedure  thereby\r\n\r\nbecomes tainted? In the case of the referendum held in the Cameroons, it is true\r\n\r\nthat  the  elector  could  decide to stay away if he  chose,  as  there  was  no\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Anson then went on to argue that in his view, if two or\r\n\r\nmore questions were put to the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nelectorate  and they were asked to choose one, then there was an  obligation  on\r\n\r\nthe  part of the Government to give an opportunity to the elector to say yes  or\r\n\r\nno  to each of the questions put. He cited as his authority for this proposition\r\n\r\nthe  many  multiple  referenda  which have been held  in  Austra1ia  under  the\r\n\r\nReferendum  (Constitution  Alteration) Act of 1906.  Everybody  knows  that  the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth of Australia is constituted by a constitutional instrument, it  is\r\n\r\nprovided in this constitutional instrument that wherever changes are to be  made\r\n\r\nto  the  constitution  1tself or to laws of general applicability,  it  will  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for the changes to the constitution or to these laws to be  submitted\r\n\r\nto  the electorate by way of a referendum. It is also provided in the Australian\r\n\r\nConstitution that where such proposals are put to the electorate  by  way  of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum, the elector must be given the right to say yes or no to each of  the\r\n\r\nproposals put.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I have with me now a copy of the ballot paper which was used in a\r\n\r\nreferendum  held in Australia in 1946 when proposals were made to the Australian\r\n\r\nelectorate  to decide on changes to be made in three laws concerning the  social\r\n\r\nservices, organised marketing of primary products, and industrial employment. In\r\n\r\neach  case  the  electorate was asked to say yes or no to each of the  questions\r\n\r\nput.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> So that, Sir, the position in Australia is that neither the Common\r\n\r\nwealth  Parliament nor any of the State Legislatures can make any law on matters\r\n\r\nwhich,  under the constitution, require popular approval by way of a  referendum\r\n\r\nunless  a  referendum is first held. Sir, that is certainly not the position  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. The Singapore Legislative Assembly has the power under section 47  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council to make laws for the peace, order\r\n\r\nand  good  government  of  Singapore. It is nowhere provided  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\n(Constitution) Order in Council that any law has to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreceive  the approval of the electorate by way of a referendum before it  is  to\r\n\r\nhave  legal  validity. How then can the Member for Anson support his proposition\r\n\r\nthat  when more than one question is put to the electorate, the electorate  must\r\n\r\nbe given the opportunity of saying yes or no to each of the questions put?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already said in this Assembly that the Member for Thomson has a\r\n\r\nfar  sharper mind than the Member for Anson in these matters. Yesterday in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  the  Member for Thomson said that it would be stupid  of  anybody  to\r\n\r\nconsider clause 5 of the Bill as it stands unless at the same time he gives  his\r\n\r\nattention  to  clause  29, because  clause  29  deprives  the  elector  of  his\r\n\r\nfundamental right to say no to each of two or more questions where he  is  asked\r\n\r\nto make a choice by putting in a blank ballot. He vent on to refer to what I had\r\n\r\nsaid  to Mrs Leon-Soh when she gave evidence before the Select Committee.  Mrs\r\n\r\nLeon-Soh asked what should an elector do if he did not like any of the questions\r\n\r\nthat  were  put, assuming that two or more questions were put. I said  that  the\r\n\r\nelector  could keep away. The Member for Thomson then feigned to express  great\r\n\r\nsurprise that such words could have come from the Minister for Law.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was clause 21 of the Bill which provides for compulsory voting. \"Here\r\n\r\nwas a Minister for Law telling the elector that he should keep away.\" The Member\r\n\r\nfor Thomson is not a naive person by any means. He well knows that clause 29 was\r\n\r\nnot in the original Bill and had to be introduced. Sir, I hinted to him that  it\r\n\r\nwas  because of the presence of clause 21 in the Bill that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\ncould not organise a boycott of the election by getting those whom they tried to\r\n\r\ndupe to keep away from the polls.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Quite simple.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He told me in polite terms that I should mind my own business, and\r\n\r\nthat the Barisan Sosialis did not need my advice on how they\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nshould go about their affairs. Sir, shortly after he spoke yesterday, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Nee Soon let the cat out of the bag. He accused the Government of trying  to\r\n\r\nset  a  trap  for the Barisan Sosialis and that we were trying to  get  them  to\r\n\r\norganize a boycott of the election so that the procedures to be found in  clause\r\n\r\n21  of  the  Bill accrue to the Government's advantage. He himself  offered  the\r\n\r\nexplanation that if the Barisan Sosialis were foolish enough to organise such  a\r\n\r\nboycott,  it would be the Barisan Sosialis who would suffer a crushing blow,  as\r\n\r\nthe  names  of  their dupes would be removed from the electoral register.  There\r\n\r\nwould  then be a deliberate delay in the revision of the registers and meanwhile\r\n\r\na snap election would be held under circumstances where their dupes would not be\r\n\r\nable  to  vote. I can assure the Member for Thomson and the Member for Nee  Soon\r\n\r\nthat  there was no trap set by the Government because clause 21 of the  Bill  is\r\n\r\nalmost  an  identical  reproduction of a similar section which  appears  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance passed by the last Government\r\n\r\nin 1959.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The purpose of his  challenge\r\n\r\nto  the  Prime  Minister  at this radio forum was to  deceive  the  people  into\r\n\r\nbelieving  that  he could get better terms for them from the  Tunku  than  those\r\n\r\ncontained in the White Paper proposals. Recently he wrote a letter to the  Tunku\r\n\r\ntelling  him that the Workers' Party was quite prepared to accept that  citizens\r\n\r\ndomiciled  in  Singapore should vote only in Singapore and that candidates  from\r\n\r\nSingapore for the Central Legislature\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be citizens domiciled in Singapore. He also asked the Tunku if, in  view\r\n\r\nof  these acceptances, he would be prepared to consider a common citizenship for\r\n\r\nboth  territories. If he wishes it to be believed that it will be  possible  for\r\n\r\nhim  to  get better terms from the Tunku than we have been able to get  for  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore in the White Paper proposals, I challenge him to publish the\r\n\r\nTunku's reply. I have seen the Tunku's reply and so have all my colleagues.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that the Tunku has given the Prime Minister a copy of his reply shows that\r\n\r\nhe  would not consider it a breach of confidence if the Member for Anson were to\r\n\r\npublish his reply.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known the Member for Anson not to be a man of courage and not to be a\r\n\r\nman  of  convictions  at  all.  When clause 29 was under  discussion  in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee,  he  issued  what he described as a warning.  This  warning  was  not\r\n\r\ndirected  specifically to anybody, otherwise he would have  mentioned  expressly\r\n\r\nthe  person  or  persons to whom this warning was addressed.  This  warning  was\r\n\r\ncouched in rather equivocal terms. He urged the Government to recognise that  if\r\n\r\nin  the  referendum to be held on merger a citizen was deprived of the right  to\r\n\r\nvote  against the Government's provisions and thereby the Government was to give\r\n\r\na  legalistic cloak to a dishonest maneuver, such a referendum would require  to\r\n\r\nbe  condoned by both the United Kingdom Government and the Federation Government\r\n\r\nbefore  it  can be put into effect. And he said that he did not think  that  the\r\n\r\nU.K.  Government would lend itself to a major act of perfidy in the  context  of\r\n\r\nthe day nor would the Government of the Federation of Malaya lend itself and co-operate actively in this major act of perfidy on the people of Singapore to seek\r\n\r\nimperial  dominion  under  a  legalistic cloak. He  also  went  on  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  if it really believed that the United Nations would permit  in  this\r\n\r\nera  an attempt at imperial annexation by the Federation of Malaya of the  State\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. I was anxious to know to whom he had addressed this warning,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore I felt it my duty to refer to this warning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nof  his  in the following terms.

I\r\n\r\nsaid  that  if  you would agree to that. I for one, and I hope my  Party,  would\r\n\r\nstruggle  with  all  our efforts to make this White Paper acceptable  with  that\r\n\r\nprovision. Now, Sir, it is true that I failed. But I\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nnever  said  to anybody that I could get it. Then, Sir, it is  said  that  I\r\n\r\nissued  a  challenge  to  the  National  Union.  The  inaccuracy  is  merely\r\n\r\nsymptomatic  of the entire inaccuracy of the inferences. He now accepts  the\r\n\r\ncorrection of the inaccuracies. I will not call them false. Sir,  because  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  that  part was intentional. But the inaccuracy  affects  the\r\n\r\nvenue  and  the  exact challenge. The challenge was that the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwas  indicating in the radio forum that he wanted two questions  because  of\r\n\r\nhis  deep  anxiety for the democratic process and respect for the Opposition\r\n\r\nviews. Above all, he wanted to put the Opposition view. He was a nice  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  who  believed  in  democracy. And it was  only  fair  to  put  the\r\n\r\nOpposition view. And I said if he would put the Opposition view,  which  was\r\n\r\ndeliberately  enunciated by us in our amendment of the 21st November,  1961,\r\n\r\nthis  is what we wanted. Now, Sir, I do ask you, could any reasonable  human\r\n\r\nbeing  suggest  that because that is what I wanted I meant that  is  what  I\r\n\r\npersonally  could get? Therefore, in saying that that is what the Opposition\r\n\r\nwant.  I am being dishonest? Sir, the charge of dishonesty has almost become\r\n\r\nso  trite that it ceases to have the gravity of effect it should have  in  a\r\n\r\ndecent  society.  Audi the Government have been repeatedly  charged  openly,\r\n\r\nfrankly  with  being  completely dishonest, and I so charge  the  suggestion\r\n\r\nmade  that because tile Opposition seek in a conciliatory effort to  achieve\r\n\r\nalterations  of  that  White Paper which could make it  acceptable,  we  are\r\n\r\ndishonest because we know we cannot get it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has added that I issued a warning to the Government of the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom. I would draw\r\n\r\nyour  attention, Sir, to column 363 [No. 6] of the Official Report of the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  the Singapore National Referendum Bill, and I  want  to  nail\r\n\r\nthat falsehood to his throat. This is the last paragraph:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'But finally, I would urge the Government to recognise that even if they\r\n\r\ncan  get  the Federation Government and the Government of the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nto lend themselves to this major act of perfidy, there is the United\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNations  and  the  Committee of Nineteen who have  the  duty  to  see  that  the\r\n\r\nimplementation -'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Surely, it is nut only the right but the duty of every citizen  who\r\n\r\nseeks  merger to make strenuous and conciliatory efforts to inprove those  terms\r\n\r\nto a point where in his view they might be acceptable to the majority.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second representations to the Prime Minister of the Federation should be\r\n\r\nput in their proper context.

The first was that in\r\n\r\nthe  context  of  the  majority representation in  the  Federation  of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nParliament,  with  100  in the Federation and 15 in Singapore,  the  possibility\r\n\r\nexists  constitutionally for the Federation representatives to  amend  the  cons\r\n\r\ntitution in a manner that might adversely affect the rights and responsibilities\r\n\r\nof  the  citizens of Singapore.

This is that those residents domiciled in one State - that is  to  say,\r\n\r\ntaking the Federation as a State, Singapore as a State, and Brunei.

Mr Chairman, this matter was adumbrated\r\n\r\nin the Select Committee, and you know that by virtue of clause 21 the person who\r\n\r\nkeeps away is not merely punished with a fine of $5. The very dangerous position\r\n\r\narises that he is deprived of his right of voting or standing for election - and\r\n\r\nthat  is a few of them - but the vast majority are deprived of their right to vote\r\n\r\nuntil  after the next register is compiled, and the compilation of the register,\r\n\r\nbeing  unfortunately  at the present time in the hands of the  P.A.P.,  you  can\r\n\r\nanticipate that they will be as dilatory as they were in holding by-elections. A\r\n\r\nman may expect, if he does not go to vote at this referendum, not only to pay  a\r\n\r\n$5  fine to get back on the register but possibly for two years he will  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  vote,  and  the P.A.P. would no doubt welcome the opportunity  whereby\r\n\r\nthose who arc the opponents of these merger proposals,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  consequently  the  opponents  of  the  P.A.P.,  will  thereby\r\n\r\ndisfranchise  them  selves  and  prevent themselves  from  voting  at  the  next\r\n\r\nelection, if, in fact, a next election takes place. So therein is the perfidy of\r\n\r\nthat  suggestion; that those persons whose conscience does not  permit  them  to\r\n\r\nvote  for  the alternatives offered, who are not permitted to deface the  ballot\r\n\r\npaper,  and  if  they leave it blank will be deemed to accept  the  Government's\r\n\r\nview,  the suggestion is that they should keep away. In truth and in fact,  this\r\n\r\nis  a  suggestion to entrap those who feel a deep sense of resentment  amounting\r\n\r\nalmost  to  hate  of  this Government which, utilising their majority,  seek  to\r\n\r\nimpose  their  will  on them. They want their opponents to  be  struck  off  the\r\n\r\nregister.  Then they will only have to contend with the S.P.A. And  I  will  say\r\n\r\nthis  to you, Mr Speaker, if you will permit an aside, I think the S.P.A. even\r\n\r\nwill  give  them a thrashing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I\r\n\r\nthink,  Sir, that must be admitted. If that is so, why not bring in  a  specific\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill for this purpose and not a general Referendum Bill? Because they\r\n\r\nwant  the best of two worlds. I did show you yesterday, Sir, and I do not intend\r\n\r\nto  repeat  it, that the Minister for Law - and, Sir, the reference  in  case  he\r\n\r\nwants to check, because I do not cheat by saving it is there when it is not: the\r\n\r\nreference is the 16th of March, page 21 of the revised transcript [Vol. 17,  No.\r\n\r\n3, col. 270] -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhe  pointed  out  to you that the New Clause (A), which is now  clause  29, was\r\n\r\nproduced specifically for the purpose of dealing with anti-merger elements. \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,\r\n\r\naccording to his speech on the 16th of March, it was a specific Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\nWhat  has he since said?

When I asked him whether he thought that the\r\n\r\nvoting of the majority against the merger proposals would be voluntary or not,\r\n\r\nhe said, \"Of course, the Member for Anson knows, and we all know, that it would\r\n\r\nbe voluntary. It will be because everybody hates the P.A.P. so much. They are so\r\n\r\nsick of the P.A.P. they want to bury them quickly so that Singapore may be\r\n\r\ncleaner and they will vote against the merger proposals to get rid of the P.A.P.\" Now, the P.A.P. say of course the merger proposals will go\r\n\r\nthrough because it is only the Communists who are going to vote against them.\r\n\r\nBut I do ask the Member for Cairnhill, whether persons will vote against the\r\n\r\nmerger proposals because they hate the P.A.P. or for any other reason  they not\r\n\r\nto have a democratic right to vote against the proposals? If putting one\r\n\r\nquestion would wreck the merger proposals, does he mean that putting one\r\n\r\nquestion would give the people the right to say \"No\", and he does not want them\r\n\r\nto have the right to say \"No\"? If that is the position, then, Sir - that seems\r\n\r\nto be the logical inference - what is the difference between the stand of the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. and the stand of the P.A.P.? Granting that the S.P.A. do not have the\r\n\r\narrogance and do things with courtesy, the position seems to be the same. We\r\n\r\nwant to cheat the people for their own good! That, in essence, seems to be the\r\n\r\ncommon stand of these gentlemen who face each other across the Floor. As a\r\n\r\nresponsible Party leader of a responsible people, which the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nis so proud of, he has damned the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. up hill and down dale. And I agree with him. And yet he votes with them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, he says that it would be better and would not wreck the referen\r\n\r\ndum  on merger if we were to have three questions. How would that help, Sir?\r\n\r\nIf  we  had  three questions, does he mean that then the people  cannot  say\r\n\r\n\"No\"  to  the  White  Paper proposals? I am glad that we are  in  Committee,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  do  appreciate  the frustrating position  where  you  are  asked\r\n\r\nquestions which are rhetorical and you cannot answer them.\r\n\r\nHere  the  Member for Cairnhill has the right to reply, and I mean the questions\r\n\r\nnot  as rhetorical questions, but as questions for his consideration. If you\r\n\r\nhave  three questions, would the people have the right to say \"No\"? If  they\r\n\r\nhave  the right to say \"No\", then they would reject the P.A.P. proposals  in\r\n\r\nthe same way, would they not? But then that is just what he does not want.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, he says he is prepared to offer them the alternative of merger\r\n\r\nlike  one of the Borneo States or merger like a State within the Federation.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  we  have  seen  how the English of  this  Assembly  has  been distorted,  so that you need a special dictionary when you are dealing  with a  statement from the Front Bench of the Government. A dictionary  of  words\r\n\r\njust  as you need a dictionary of words when you are in Communist China - when\r\n\r\nyou  hear  \"socialist\", that means \"Communist\"; when you  hear  \"democracy\",\r\n\r\nthat  means  \"dictatorship\". Here you hear \"complete merger\"  and  they  say\r\n\r\nthat means \"cut your citizenship in half\". That is the P.A.P. dictionary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at least the P.A.P. merger proposals have been spelt out to some extent in White Paper Command No. 33, although I notice that the Prime Minis\r\n\r\nter  is  very reluctant that the real draft constitution should be disclosed\r\n\r\nto  us  before voting day. I do not know what more there is in store in  the\r\n\r\nway  of  perfidy  for our people from this Government in that  constitution,\r\n\r\nbut  I  do  note with some anxiety that we are refused sight  of  the  draft\r\n\r\nbefore  referendum.  But  I  ask, how can he then offer  other  alternatives\r\n\r\nwhich  have  not  been  spelt out and feel safe that  the  Government  would\r\n\r\nimplement  the other alternatives in the spirit in which they are  intended?\r\n\r\nIf the other alternative is complete merger or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmerger  like Brunei, does he know to what extent it would be distorted? Because,\r\n\r\nlet us recognise that when the Barisan Sosialis first used the words \"Penang and\r\n\r\nMalacca\", they used them in reply to the Deputy Prime Minister's letter and they\r\n\r\nsaid,  Mr Speaker, this is the context, \"an immediate, full and complete merger\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore  joining the Federation as a constituent State like  Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca\".  Sir,  the  context was \"a constituent State\";  the  context  was  \"an\r\n\r\nimmediate,  full and complete\". Now, Sir, there were no Penang or  Malacca  citizens;  so  there can be no question that anybody was deprived of his citizenship\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation. If you want to take any State, Sir - there were, say,  Johore\r\n\r\ncitizens  or citizens of the Sultan who immediately became citizens  when,  say,\r\n\r\nJohore  and  Negri  Sembilan -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I wonder whether the Member\r\n\r\ncould  not reserve those comments until we deal with the motion to be  moved  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown wherein he asks this House to condemn the Government\r\n\r\nfor  its \"dishonest and malicious distortion\" of the Opposition's stand  on  the\r\n\r\nmerger issue. Otherwise we will never finish.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, indeed. I have\r\n\r\nbrought it up in the context of a question to the Member for Cairnhill: how does\r\n\r\nhe  anticipate that the posing of another question, two questions,  or  a  third\r\n\r\nquestion, that is to say, questions that have not been clearly spelt out,  would\r\n\r\nbe helpful in the context of this referendum? And finally, Sir, he did in Select\r\n\r\ncommittee  move  an  amendment which was negatived by the Government's  majority\r\n\r\nthat every voter should be allowed to vote \"Yes\" or 'Nay\" to each question.  But\r\n\r\nhe  agreed  that  there  should be one issue, but any number  of  questions.  In\r\n\r\nfairness,  let  us  get  it  clear, that insofar as  one-third  of  the  present\r\n\r\namendment  goes,  he  did not agree that there should be one  question.  But  he\r\n\r\nagreed  that  each referendum should be limited to one issue and  that  a  voter\r\n\r\nshould be required to answer \"Yes\" or \"Nay\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, that is the crux, I repeat crux, of the whole exercise. If the voter\r\n\r\nhas the right to put a cross for \"Yes\" or for \"No\", to say \"Yes\" or 'No\", then,  Sir,  \r\n\r\nwhatever the Machiavellian efforts of the Government, I  think,  on balance, the people \r\n\r\nwould be safe. If the voter does not have the right  to  say \"Yes\" or \"No\" to each question \r\n\r\nand he is compelled to have a choice, then,  Sir, the  choice can be so presented, as the \r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill himself said,  that the  only  possible one, the least unacceptable one, \r\n\r\nwould be the one which  the Government  proposes.  Now,  the Member for Cairnhill  knows  that,  \r\n\r\nand  it  is interesting  to  notice his change of stand on this crucial  issue.  Whereas  in\r\n\r\nSelect Committee, he was prepared to support, and in fact, propagated a specific\r\n\r\namendment to enable the people of Singapore to say \"Yes\" or \"No\", here  we  have\r\n\r\nfair words, as fair words as were in Select Committee, but shorn of the deed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Minister for Law has the gall to say that in Australia and the Cameroons they did not have the choice to say \"No\". Sir, I will be happy to\r\n\r\npass  this book down. I thought I read it yesterday hut I just want to show  the\r\n\r\nballot  paper. I can assure you I will not trespass on time more than necessary.\r\n\r\nSir, Australian Commonwealth Acts 1901 to 1950, Volume IV, page 3585;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Where there are several propositions to the people of Australia, each one\r\n\r\nmust be answered with a 'Yes' or a 'No'.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, he says \"But that is in the Constitution\". Ha! I do not understand\r\n\r\nthe argument, Mr Speaker, forgive me. That is so. It is in the Constitution.  A\r\n\r\nconstitution enunciated for the welfare of the people and for their just  govern\r\n\r\nance. He says in Singapore we have got a right to make laws for good government,\r\n\r\nand  obviously  for  bad  government, of the country. We  are  not  bound  by  a\r\n\r\nconstitution. Does that mean, Sir, that we have a right to be dishonest  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide for machinery whereby in the words, the classic words now, of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill, the Government can have flexibility for dishonest manoeuvre? What\r\n\r\nis wrong with following the Australian provisions, Sir? What harm could possibly\r\n\r\nbe done? We showed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyou, as we sought yesterday to say - I know that the Front Bench is deaf - that  the\r\n\r\nCameroons was a trust property, that the United Nations could only give them two\r\n\r\nalternatives:  there were no other alternatives available, and those  two  alternatives were given to the people without compulsion to vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the cameroons were in a specific and unusual position. Our Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  unfortunately  has  said that if you  ask  624,000  of  our  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens what kind of merger they want, they will get 624,000 types of merger. I do not agree with him, but let us take him at his word. It is not therefore\r\n\r\ntwo alternatives! There are, according to the P.A.P. Prime Minister, 624,000  alternatives you can give: therefore is it not proper at least that in our efforts\r\n\r\nto  seek their opinion we should give them the opportunity to say \"Yes\" or  \"No\"\r\n\r\nto  each proposition which is going to affect them and their children for  ever,\r\n\r\nSir?  This is not a matter of a Licensing Bill; this is not a matter of toddy-shops;\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  matter  of our future. Can the Minister indicate,  apart  from  the\r\n\r\nunusual position of the Cameroons, that, in fact, he knows very well where there\r\n\r\nwas  the  question  of  a  constitutional change in Switzerland.  And,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nSwitzerland is it not provided in the constitution that they shall say \"Yes\"  or\r\n\r\n\"No\"? In Switzerland there was a special law passed in 1892 to implement Article\r\n\r\n120, and it was that law which says that every referendum must require an answer\r\n\r\nof \"Yes\" or \"No\". We have told you because we have already shown it to you - West\r\n\r\nAustralia, Jamaica. Sir, why cannot we follow all these countries? \"Because this\r\n\r\nis  a general referendum Bill!\" We now go back to the curious somersault of the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister.  I  am  told  that  was  unfortunate.  It  came   about\r\n\r\nunfortunately because he did not hear the expose earlier on of how  I  indicated\r\n\r\nthat  they had all said that it was a specific provision for a specific purpose.\r\n\r\nI think he said \"one prospect only\", Sir;\r\n\r\nI  take it whichever way you read P.A.P. English, \"one prospect only\" means  one\r\n\r\npurpose only.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> All right, let us make it one\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am obliged to the Deputy Prime Minister if he agrees then\r\n\r\nthat  this  Bill should be for one purpose only.

To  deny  to  this\r\n\r\nGovernment  the right to cheat the people because they say  if  you  do  not\r\n\r\ncheat them, they will be robbed. So it is better that we should\r\n\r\ncheat  them for their own good. That is the essential purpose for which I  stand\r\n\r\nand  I  know, Sir, that there are many Members who have not spoken from  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A. side,  and I do hope to hear from them, perhaps in clarification  of\r\n\r\nthe  position which would correct the unhappy effect I received last  night.\r\n\r\nUntil last night, Sir, I thought that if we go down, at least we go down  as\r\n\r\na  united group, a united group which will highlight the basic dishonesty of\r\n\r\nthis Government, and not - The Member for Thomson has risen, Sir.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Bani, four\r\n\r\nminutes to five o'clock.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I realise\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister for Health and Law has got his warring glands functioning  ab\r\n\r\nnormally today and I do not want to earn his displeasure, at least not more than\r\n\r\nis  necessary.

It  has  been  done in the Assembly, time and again. The  Standing  Order\r\n\r\nitself  is  a  curious Standing Order. It is very flexible.  I  think  the  word\r\n\r\n\"flexible\" has been used in this debate. Standing Order 46 (4) reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It shall be out of order to use offensive and insulting language about\r\n\r\nMembers of the Assembly.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a particularity - you must be guilty of using offensive language\r\n\r\nabout Members of the Assembly.

Sir,  even  in  Nazi\r\n\r\nGermany,  as  has already been pointed out a number of times by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson,  the right of the people to reject a proposition  was  given.  I\r\n\r\nknow  this hurts the Ministers very much, Sir, and naturally they would like\r\n\r\nto  try  and ensure that the case is not put forward as clearly as possible.\r\n\r\nSo  far in the past, at forums and elsewhere, they have been getting away by\r\n\r\ngiving  apparently .a coherent argument because they have forced  discussion\r\n\r\nin isolation of one clause against another.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I did say yesterday that as far as we are concerned, we do not seek\r\n\r\nto  confuse anybody. We are quite prepared to sit down and argue this out as\r\n\r\nclearly  and  as  simply as possible so that nobody would be  confused,  not\r\n\r\neven the most stupid of persons who live in Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the examples of the New Zealand referenda quoted by the\r\n\r\nMinister for Law were already dealt with by me yesterday, and I do not  want\r\n\r\nto  go  back and deal with them once again, but I must emphasise once  again\r\n\r\nthat in\r\n\r\nthe  New  Zealand referenda, the basic and fundamental democratic  right  of  a\r\n\r\nvoter  to either accept or reject or to abstain was not denied to him either\r\n\r\nby legislation or by any other force.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Minister for Labour quotes the Cameroons example, and to my\r\n\r\nquestion  as  to  whether there was compulsory voting, the Minister  himself\r\n\r\nsaid  that  there  was no compulsory voting. It is true, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nfrom  what  I understand, in the Cameroons, the voters were asked to  choose\r\n\r\nbetween two propositions, and in the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npolling booth, two boxes were put, and the voter was expected to put his vote in\r\n\r\none  of the two boxes depending on what proposition he chose. First of all.  The\r\n\r\nreason why they put the boxes was that in the Cameroons the rate of literacy  is\r\n\r\nvery  low and because they did not want to confuse the people by asking them  to\r\n\r\nvote in writing or vote by marking on a ballot paper, they made it a very simple\r\n\r\naffair  by  making the boxes represent the propositions. Because  there  was  no\r\n\r\ncompulsory voting in the Cameroons - this does not mean we are against compulsory\r\n\r\nvoting:\r\n\r\nI  have  already stated earlier that we have nothing against clause  21  of  the\r\n\r\nBill - a voter, if he did not like both these propositions, need not have gone  to\r\n\r\nvote.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every voter wants to exercise his right to vote. No voter wants to go and\r\n\r\nput  in  a  blank vote. No voter wants to stay away unnecessarily, and no  voter\r\n\r\nwants to tear away a ballot paper. Every voter, I am quite certain, is conscious\r\n\r\nof  his  civic rights and he wants to exercise that voting right. But if  it  is\r\n\r\nsought  to force him to vote one way or the other, if it is sought to indirectly\r\n\r\ncompel  the 624,000 voters in our electorate to vote for one of two unacceptable\r\n\r\nalternatives, then undoubtedly there is going to be a large percentage of voters\r\n\r\nwho  would  be  helpless. And if one wants to tear away a ballot paper,  if  one\r\n\r\nwants to put in a blank vote, it is not because he does not like to exercise his\r\n\r\ncivic right, but because he finds that he cannot choose between two unacceptable\r\n\r\nalternatives.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Yesterday, I said that we  have\r\n\r\ngreat respect for the intelligence of the people and we do not think any man - let\r\n\r\nalone the P.A.P.

Sir, it is suggested that it is necessary to  have\r\n\r\nmore than two questions and it is necessary to have certain other provisions  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill because they want to fix the Barisan Sosialis and they want to fix the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  This  is a very serious proposition, Mr Speaker,  Sir.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  himself - none other than the master of the P.A.P. - has said that  there\r\n\r\nare  only 300 Communists in Singapore. I ask then, Sir, whether they are in fact\r\n\r\nfixing  the  300 Communists or if they are fixing the lives of over 1.6  million\r\n\r\npeople in denying the\r\n\r\n624,000 voters the basic right of free choice.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that notwithstanding the number of\r\n\r\nquestions,  the fundamental right to choose freely, to say yes  or  no,  or,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  abstain,  must  be  given to the  people.  And  that  is  the  basic\r\n\r\nproposition the Barisan Sosialis is making. We do not like two questions.

The Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nsays that we are going to get it. Let them show it by supporting this amendment.\r\n\r\nLet  them  show  it  by supporting the amendment to clause 29.  It  is  not  the\r\n\r\nCommunists or the Barisan Sosialis who are going to be in a zugzwang.  Those  of\r\n\r\nus  in the Barisan Sosialis are not worried because we know one cannot cheat the\r\n\r\npeople all the time. We know what the consequences are going to be, and we  know\r\n\r\nwho is going to pay for this.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not afraid of a referendum. We do not want to block a referendum. We\r\n\r\nwant  a  referendum. We insist that the people must be consulted, but in a  fair\r\n\r\nand decent referendum. We oppose this Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, not because we  do\r\n\r\nnot want a referendum, hut because the Bill is undemocratic and because the Bill\r\n\r\nwill  not bring about a fair and reasonable referendum which will ascertain  the\r\n\r\nviews of the people. They have said, \"What is wrong with putting two questions?\"\r\n\r\nI  tell them, Sir, fundamentally, there is nothing wrong. But first we must  not\r\n\r\nforget  clauses 21 and 29. It is a very desirable democratic right of the people\r\n\r\nto choose freely. They should have an uninterfered right to choose 'yes', 'no' or\r\n\r\nto  abstain.  That is fundamental. That we cannot compromise. If that  right  is\r\n\r\ngiven to the people, then we say, \"You want to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhave  two  questions, first question- White Paper merger;  second  question-\r\n\r\nyou  want  to  put  the Bartizan type of merger, put the  Bartizan  type  of\r\n\r\nmerger  as  has been stated.\" At least they must have the common decency  to\r\n\r\nlet us tell what we mean by complete merger.\r\n\r\nIt  is utterly ridiculous for them to suggest, \"This is what we mean by  com\r\n\r\nplete  merger-half the voters lose their citizenship rights.\"  I  would  not\r\n\r\nventure\r\n\r\nTo distort what their version of anything\r\n\r\nIs. I would have, as I said, the common\r\n\r\ndecency to ask them to define what they\r\n\r\nwant. What we want has already been\r\n\r\ndefined in clear and in unambiguous\r\n\r\nterms in the amendment we moved to\r\n\r\nthe motion sometime in November. At\r\n\r\nthe right time, we shall say that once\r\n\r\nagain. But let not lies and distortions\r\n\r\ncloud the issues. Today the Government\r\n\r\nwant to have a referendum that would\r\n\r\nget a majority support for the White\r\n\r\nPaper merger. It is imperative. This is\r\n\r\nsomething on which the survival of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. depends.  And because of that, they are prepared  to  sacrifice  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the people. Because they are committed to a referendum,  they\r\n\r\nhave  to hold one. If they hold a referendum, they must make sure that  they\r\n\r\nget  the  majority. So under the Referendum Bill before the Committee,  with\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  as they stand now, if ten per cent of the voters  vote  for\r\n\r\nthe  Government's proposition (No. 1, White Paper merger), 30 per cent  vote\r\n\r\nfor proposition No. 2, and 60 per cent abstain because of the provisions  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  it will in fact mean that 70 per cent support the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nmerger.  This is no zugzwang for the Barisan Sosialis. This is  no  zugzwang\r\n\r\nfor the Communists. This\r\n\r\nis zugzwang  for  the people. And whoever supports this Bill,  I  will  say  in\r\n\r\nsimple language he is a traitor.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  the  Member for Anson posed certain  questions  to  me  last\r\n\r\nnight.

You will remember that at one stage the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nsaid - this  is  at  column 150 [Official Report of the Select Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore National Referendum Bill (No. 3) dated 8th May, 1962]:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Goh Keng Swee: I think the Member for Cairnhill has succeeded in\r\n\r\nconfusing everybody.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And you, Sir, said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I think he has . . .

I must say that - definitely confused!'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>So,  it would seem that in order to try to make confusion less confounded, I had\r\n\r\nonly  succeeded in making confusion more confounded. Then the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\ntried to explain. I am indeed indebted to him for trying to explain my stand. He\r\n\r\ngave his reasons. And you, Sir, said at column 152:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Member for Cairnhill is interpreting his amendment in that way, and I\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Anson has interpreted it in a different way.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>So, my suggestion was capable of various interpretations, so much so that  even\r\n\r\nwhen  we  adjourned  and  met on Friday, 11th of May, we discussed  this  matter\r\n\r\nfurther  and this was what the Member for Hong Lim said at column 157  [Official\r\n\r\nReport  of  the Select Committee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill  (No.\r\n\r\n4)]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I feel that the amendment to the amendment moved by the Member for Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nalthough he is trying to bring both views to a compromise, still leaves room for\r\n\r\nmanoeuvring, and as such I oppose it.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>The Member for Queenstown was quick to follow at column 158. He had this to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Therefore, the amendment to the amendment again does not solve the problem\r\n\r\nand  it will not achieve the objective of getting a true and correct answer from\r\n\r\nthe electorate.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And the Member for Anson, at column\r\n\r\n161, had this to say - it was coming to\r\n\r\nthe end of the debate: \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Now, in answer to the Member for Cairnhill. My suggestion\r\n\r\nis that in  matters of  grave  national moment, there must be precision in the questions sought.  \r\n\r\nIf there are alternatives to he put, then each alternative can he put  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  a  separate referendum with the text of the proposed constitutional  changes attached. \r\n\r\nThey are of considerable clarity.'  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  was  clear that in the Select Committee when I was trying to be  helpful  it turned out that I made everybody confused, even my friends in the Opposition. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of 4, 3 began to have doubts and, therefore, when I asked for leave to\r\n\r\nmove that amendment, leave was not granted.

Thank you,\r\n\r\nSir, for your correction. The amendment was defeated not only on the vote of the\r\n\r\nGovernment, but on the vote of the Opposition in association with the Government\r\n\r\nagainst poor me - the S.P.A. Member in the Select Committee.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I came to this sitting last Wednesday - two days ago - I was ready to\r\n\r\nmove my amendment. I had, in fact, a gestetnered copy of a similar amendment and\r\n\r\nI  thought  I could move my amendment when this particular amendment was  moved,\r\n\r\nbut  then  because  I  saw  that even on the first amendment,  on  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nconstitutional  practice  and  procedure, there was  so  much  unnecessary  heat\r\n\r\ngenerated and so much unnecessary talk and exchange of harsh words that  I  felt\r\n\r\nthat  it  would  not  be right for me to try and put in an  amendment  that  had\r\n\r\nalready  been  defeated and not supported by some Members of the Opposition,  to\r\n\r\ntry and prolong this - I would not say this unnecessary - debate on a very important national issue. Therefore, I did not move  it.\r\n\r\nOf  course, if I were like some Members who wish to hear their own voice in this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  I might have done it, but being a responsible Member of the Assembly,\r\n\r\nI  felt  that  the  time  of  this Assembly should  be  devoted  to  matters  of\r\n\r\nimportance, matters that can serve the interests of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore did not send in my amendment, although I was prepared to do\r\n\r\nit.  We  have  so  far  already spent fifteen hours debating  this  present\r\n\r\namendment.  I  was  indeed very glad to hear you say before  the  tea-break\r\n\r\nthat  you  proposed to put the Question after all the charges  levelled  at\r\n\r\ncertain  Members  of  this  Assembly  had  been  answered  by  the  Members\r\n\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the Select Committee, I made it clear that I did not like the\r\n\r\namendment  of  one  question one issue. I did not like it  and  I  gave  my\r\n\r\nreasons in\r\n\r\nmy  two speeches why I could not support the amendment, and I spoke in  very\r\n\r\nstrong  language  in  Select Committee because it was not  refuted  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that I had come to know that the Government proposed to put  two\r\n\r\nquestions - \"Do you want White Paper 33 where we have autonomy in labour  and\r\n\r\neducation?\"  Or \"Do you want the Barisan type of merger where 340,000  non-local  born citizens will lose their citizenship rights?\" Sir, when I heard\r\n\r\nthat  it  was suggested that these two questions should be posed, naturally\r\n\r\nI  was  not only very angry but I would say annoyed and gave a piece of  my\r\n\r\nmind.  I said I would not allow the Government to go on with this dishonest\r\n\r\nway  of  posing questions in a referendum on merger. I made my stand clear.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister for Finance has said that the Government will agree that  the questions  will  be debated in this Assembly before they  are  posed  in  a referendum.  That, I take it, is an admission that they saw  the  error  of\r\n\r\ntheir  ways  and  that they are prepared to amend their  ways.  Surely  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis will still be able to have the opportunity to  speak  for\r\n\r\ndays on end when the questions are being debated in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, talking of my supposed change of stand from a \"yes\" to a \"no\", what I\r\n\r\nsuggested in the Select Committee was that, first, there should be one\r\n\r\nissue  but there could be more than one question, but the meat of the issue\r\n\r\nshould  be  posed first - \"Do you want closer association with the Federation\r\n\r\nof  Malaya'?\" Yes or No. If it is \"yes\", then there could be 3, 4, 5, or  6\r\n\r\nquestions; everything like \"Yes\", \"No\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes\",  \"No\",  \"Yes\", \"No\", and it was, I think, the Member for Anson  who  said\r\n\r\nthere could be 3 yeses and then, where would we be? Then I said we would get  no\r\n\r\nanswer.  Surely  to  spend  $400,000 of public money  on  a  referendum,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  an  answer in clear and certain terms  should  be  ascertained.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I did not move my amendment and now what is this referendum to be  on\r\n\r\nmerger?  We  claim that White Paper Command 33 is not merger;  it  is  a  closer\r\n\r\nrelation  with the Federation of Malaya - that we do not mind - we do not  want  to\r\n\r\nquibble about words. It is, can we say, half merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Parties, I said yesterday, are committed to merger. Everyone, even if I\r\n\r\ntake  my  Party  Constitution's objects, wants to achieve merger with  the  Fede\r\n\r\nration  of  Malaya. The P.A.P., the Barisan Sosialis, the U.P.P.,  the  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  and even the Parties that are not represented in the Assembly say merger,\r\n\r\nmerger,  merger,  but  no Party has defined what that term  'merger'  means.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it must be merger. Admitted that what is meant by that is that we  want\r\n\r\nto join the Federation of Malaya as a constituent State in the Federation in the\r\n\r\nsame way as other constituent States are in the Federation. We want that because\r\n\r\nwe  want  to  be  free from British colonial rule. Right, so  all  Parties  want\r\n\r\nmerger.  So what is wrong if the P.A.P. says, \"Sorry, we cannot achieve  merger.\r\n\r\nThe  best that we could do with the Tunku is this half merger.\" There are  other\r\n\r\nParties  who  are  more bold, more brave, more militant, but unfortunately  more\r\n\r\nunrealistic by demanding complete merger. Merger to the extent that they know it\r\n\r\nin  the  objects of their Parties, on the platforms of their Parties. They  want\r\n\r\ncomplete  and  unconditional merger. So why do they not pose that question?  Now\r\n\r\nbecause  of  Brunei,  Sarawak and Borneo coming into the greater  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, what is wrong in posing that question to the electorate, \"Do you  want\r\n\r\nit  like Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei?\" So there I say, when you pose these  three\r\n\r\nquestions - the first is White Paper Command 33, I call it half merger; the second\r\n\r\nis complete and unconditional merger with the Federation on\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe same basis as any one of the constituent States in the Federation; the third\r\n\r\none  is  entering  the Federation of Malaysia on terms no less  favourable  than\r\n\r\nthose  of  any  one  of the Borneo territories - those are  the  three  possible\r\n\r\nquestions that face anyone -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think the Member has made this point on this amendment.\r\n\r\n1'hat  argument will arise, as I say, when the Minister for Finance  tables  the\r\n\r\nmotion.  I do not know what procedure he is adopting, but he has said that  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  is going to debate the questions to he put to the people. So  I  think\r\n\r\nall this can be reserved until we do debate these questions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, the charge of the Member for Anson is\r\n\r\nnot  the  posing of three questions, but my keeping firm in \"yes\" or \"no\".  Yes,\r\n\r\nSir,  I am trying to answer the \"yes\" or \"no\" charge of the Member for Anson.  I\r\n\r\nam not posing the three questions. So, well, I -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. But the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  has  gone  a  little further. He says what is  wrong  with  these  three\r\n\r\nquestions'? That is exciting a debate. Another Member can properly stand up  and\r\n\r\nsay, \"Oh, it is wrong.\" A Member in the Opposition might say the second question\r\n\r\nis  wrong.  Therefore, the whole debate is opened up. Let us get  on  with  this\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am bound by your ruling, Sir. The questions I said I heard\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. were intending to pose in a referendum were dishonest, but I  cannot\r\n\r\nagree to one question, because it would give us an answer that would not be  the\r\n\r\ncorrect answer. So, let us have three questions, four questions, five questions,\r\n\r\nso  long  as the questions to be posed are settled by a full, frank and  lengthy\r\n\r\ndebate  in  this  Assembly. Sir, everyone wants merger,  that  is,  every  Party\r\n\r\nrepresented  here  and  outside wants merger.  So,  let  us  make  use  of  this\r\n\r\nreferendum  and go and ascertain from the people what type they  want.  Do  they\r\n\r\nwant this half merger of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  or  do they want the full complete merger of all political Parties,  or\r\n\r\ndo  they  think  now, \"Maybe we have the Federation of Malaysia,  we  want  the Borneo  territories merger.\" On the Borneo territories, there is a lot  of  heat generated because of the moves and counter-moves, political moves and  what  not that  this Bill presents. It is said that this is a general referendum Bill  hut they are trying to prove that this Bill is meant only for the merger referendum.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Government that the only way to take the heat off this unnecessary, lengthy and provocative debate is to give an assurance to this House that once the referendum is completed, the Ordinance will be repealed. Let us forget whether it is going to be a general Bill or a merger Referendum Bill. Let us get down to the serious business of the day. We want a referendum on merger. We want the questions for the referendum to be debated in this Assembly. We want the questions to be posed in an honest, straightforward manner. And we\r\n\r\nwant to get an answer from the people of Singapore as to what they like.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, to reply to certain charges made by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson.

Sir, my point, is that the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nand  the Workers' Party have said quite clearly and unequivocally that they want\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger. May I read again what the Workers' Party has said about  this?\r\n\r\nThey  believe that the ultimate solution is integration with Malaya on an  equal\r\n\r\nbasis  with the other States. They go on to say that what they want is  complete\r\n\r\nand unconditional merger with the Federation of Malaya. So does the Barisan.\r\n\r\nNow,  how does this clause, this addition of automatic conversion of citizenship\r\n\r\ncome  about? I suggest this proviso of automatic conversion is merely  their  in\r\n\r\nterpretation of what complete merger means. May I quote from what the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  said during the debate on referendum? You will recollect that we said  we\r\n\r\nwere  not prepared to support complete merger because it meant that half of  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore could be disfranchised.

We will say complete merger on the same and equal basis as any State of the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. That is a fair enough proposition. If they  believe  that\r\n\r\nthat  means automatic conversion, they are entitled to believe that that is  so,\r\n\r\nbut whether they are right or whether we are right is a matter to be settled  by\r\n\r\nconstitutional jurists. I mean the laws of citizenship are there; they apply  in\r\n\r\nthe  Federation:  they would apply in Singapore. But if their proposal  is  more\r\n\r\nthan\r\n\r\ntheir  interpretation of what complete merger means, then all I say is they  are\r\n\r\nsimply  asking for super merger, merger on more favourable terms and  conditions\r\n\r\nthan any of the 11 States of the Federation enjoys in respect of citizenship.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I wonder if I can ask the Minister one question.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister will\r\n\r\ngive way.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged.\r\n\r\nCould  the  Minister say whether the Government is in possession of any  jurist opinion on the issue? \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have the views of the Governinent's legal adviser, the State Advocate- General and he is a lawyer of some eminence, and we base our opinion on his interpretation.

I do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  repeat all the arguments, Sir, except to say that even  here  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  they have been saying that this is a Referendum Bill and also a Bill  for\r\n\r\nmerger.

When  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  that, Sir, the Prime Minister jumped up and asked if  I  could  quote\r\n\r\nreferences.  I have the quotes, Sir, and I will show them to you now.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nSir,  textbooks  all  over  the  world say that the  correct  translation  of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  is  not  \"chyuen mm tou piau\" but \"chyuen min fu chyueh\".  I  am  now\r\n\r\nquoting, Sir, from a textbook called \"On Comparative Study of Constitutions\". It\r\n\r\nis  a  texbook of China published in 1936 and is used for the Peking  University\r\n\r\nDepartment of Law. It is written by Hwang Shih Chieh and Chen Tuan Tseng.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former was once a Foreign Minister of old China. I will now read to you\r\n\r\nfrom  page  277  where  the  authors talk of direct legislative  rights  of  the\r\n\r\ncitizens. I will read it in Mandarin so that it can be translated for you by the\r\n\r\nofficial interpreter:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Interpreter's version]-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A referendum means that any Bills or\r\n\r\nconstitutional resolutions are put to the citizens for a decision as to  whether\r\n\r\nsuch Bills or constitutional resolutions are to be approved.

It is  only\r\n\r\nthen that the result can be said to be the expression of the will of the people.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by freedom or choice of vote not only includes the right to say no\r\n\r\nbut  also  the  right  of  people  to organise political  parties  and/or  other\r\n\r\norganisations in order to strengthen the opposition [that is to the issue].'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have only given one quotation from this book but if the Government\r\n\r\nMinisters want to challenge me on quotations I can assure them that I  can  give\r\n\r\nthem  another  10 or 20 quotations. I think this should convince the  Government\r\n\r\nMinisters  that  we  are  not  talking without any  basis.  It  is  the  general\r\n\r\nrecognition  all  over  the world that when you talk of a  referendum  you  mean\r\n\r\ntaking the decision already arrived at and passed in the Legislative Assembly to\r\n\r\nthe  people  so that the people outside the Assembly may accept or  reject  such\r\n\r\ndecision  on  any  proposed law in the country. This  is  very  important,  Sir,\r\n\r\nespecially in relation to the White Paper merger proposals of the P.A.P. today.\r\n\r\nOf  course they want to get out of their own zugzwang by posing two unacceptable\r\n\r\nquestions in the referendum but I hope to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbring that in when I move my motion condemning the Government for the distortion\r\n\r\nof our stand.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance says that the real issue at stake in the whole\r\n\r\nof this Referendum Bill - and he mentioned it in relation to the amendment that is\r\n\r\nbefore  us - is:  should  the  Communists be  allowed  the  chance  to  wreck  the\r\n\r\nreferendum?  Sir,  all  their arguments do not hold water.  Whenever  they  find\r\n\r\nthemselves cornered, whenever they find that their arguments are rebutted,  they\r\n\r\nalways go back to the same old theme, that this is a general Referendum Bill, or\r\n\r\nwhen  that  fails, they bring up the Communist bogey. It is always the Communist\r\n\r\nbogey,  Sir. Why? Because the Communists cannot answer back. Nobody defends  the\r\n\r\nCommunists and nobody can answer for them and therefore it is a convenient label\r\n\r\nto  put on because, the Communists being illegal, none of us would speak up  for\r\n\r\nthem.  But  let  us see what substance they have in their arguments.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister in a speech before the foreign correspondents before he went to  London\r\n\r\nsaid  that  the  Communists were never more isolated. Similarly,  Mr  Jek  Yuen\r\n\r\nThong,  the Political Secretary to the Prime Minister, said over the  radio  the\r\n\r\nsame  thing, that the Communists are now conscribed and isolated. Even the Minister  for Finance said something to that effect, and the Prime Minister,  in  London,  mentioned also that 99.5 per cent of the people in Singapore  are  neutral\r\n\r\nand  that only a very small section of the people were supposed to be Communists\r\n\r\nand  pro-Communists. Sir, the Minister for Finance now says that this is  all  a\r\n\r\nCommunist  threat.  Of course they have been contradicting  themselves  all  the\r\n\r\ntime, but one has to pin them down some time or other and we must ask them:\r\n\r\nWho is the person who has not been speaking the truth? Was it the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nor  was it Mr Jek Yuen Thong or was it the Minister for Finance? Tell us.  Only\r\n\r\none  person  can speak the truth in this case and they must tell us who  is  not\r\n\r\nspeaking the truth. Sir, it is always the habit of the Government to concentrate\r\n\r\ntheir attack and their propaganda\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmachine  against  any section of public opinion or public activity  that  causes\r\n\r\nthem  anxiety. By this, Sir, they hope to prejudice public opinion against  that\r\n\r\nsection of people who cause anxiety to them, and the commonest label which  they\r\n\r\ncan  think of nowadays is the \"Communist and the Red\". I remember I said  before\r\n\r\nin  this House some time back that the label they used about 40 or 50 years  ago\r\n\r\nwas  \"Socialist\"  or  \"Labour\"; that about 70 or 80 years  ago,  the  label  was\r\n\r\n\"Radical\",  and  that  possibly  1,900 years ago,  the  label  was  \"Christian\".\r\n\r\nNowadays, Sir, Communism has become synonymous with effective opposition and  if\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister himself will remember, he also was labelled Red and a  pro-Communist  when he was in the Opposition. Let us see their arguments,  Sir.  All\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  anti-Communist claim that they are anti-Communist  because  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  are dictatorial and because they rob the individual of his  freedom.\r\n\r\nBut  let  us  examine  what  has happened in Singapore  today  and  ask  who  is\r\n\r\ndictatorial  and  who  is  robbing the individual of  his  freedom?  Is  it  the\r\n\r\nOpposition? Is it the Barisian Sosialis? It is none other, Sir, than the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P.,  especially the Prime Minister and the Minister  for  Finance,  are\r\n\r\ndoing  just  that.  They are not only dictatorial outside but also  inside  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  I  do not think I need remind you, Sir, of the many occasions  of  their\r\n\r\npractice of parliamentary dictatorship in this House.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

This alone, Sir, should tell us how dictatorial the Government\r\n\r\nare in everything they do.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to answer again the charge that it is due to the Communists. Sir, in the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nworld  today,  especially when the socialist movement is gaining strength  every\r\n\r\nwhere,  there must be Communists everywhere. There must be Communists  all  over\r\n\r\nthe  world,  in  Britain itself, in the United States of America.  In  Indonesia\r\n\r\nthere  are  2 million Communists. In Singapore only 300, according to the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  So it is absurd to say that just because there are certain Communists\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, therefore, we fire not supposed to have our democratic  right  of\r\n\r\nsaying  \"No\"  and  other rights of freedom. The Communists have advocated  anti-colonialism. They have advocated that the wages of workers be raised. They  have\r\n\r\nadvocated  that our standard of living should be raised. Does it mean that  just\r\n\r\nbecause  they have advocated these things, so we cannot also advocate the  same'\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, the argument which the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have  been  advancing cannot convince many people. They  cannot  even\r\n\r\nconvince themselves, and they can only hope to deceive themselves. What we light\r\n\r\nfor  are  the  interests  of the people, and if they should  coincide  with  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the Communists, then we should not be debarred from working for the\r\n\r\nsame  interests that serve the people. Even the Prime Minister himself said that\r\n\r\nif  there are things that are good for the Communists but if they are also  good\r\n\r\nfor  the  people,  then the P.A.P. would support them; but it appears  that  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister only thinks of the P.A.P. these days.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have repeatedly claimed that all those who are against merger are\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Today they have further claimed that all those who are against  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill are also Communists or pro-Communists. I do not know, Sir, about\r\n\r\nthe  Workers' Party and about the Member for Anson. Nobody can say that he is  a\r\n\r\nCommunist. The Member for Hong Lim of the United People's Party - nobody  can  say\r\n\r\nthat  he  is a Communist.

By so doing,  they\r\n\r\nhope  that the Opposition will be, according to the words of the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\ncontained, conscribed and rendered ineffective. Of course, when there is no more\r\n\r\nopposition to the P.A.P., then they hope to maintain themselves in office and to\r\n\r\nlive  and rule merrily ever after. 'The intention, Sir, is very clear.  All  the\r\n\r\ntime  they  talk of the Communist bogey, but it is not because of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  or of anything else, but because of the selfish interests  of  a  few\r\n\r\nleaders in the P.A.P. I do not think I need go further on this, Sir, but  may  I\r\n\r\nbe  permitted to say a few words on the question which the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nhas  been  talking about? He said, \"Do you prefer complete merger to  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  merger?\" Sir, this is a most misleading question. What we are asking  for\r\n\r\nis  not a double-headed question but a simple and straightforward one. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthis  question  can he divided into two. It is not one question. There  are  two\r\n\r\nquestions  put  into  one. And, therefore, it is unfair  to  the  voter  and  is\r\n\r\ncompletely  misleading. That is why we stress that the question must  be  simple\r\n\r\nand straightforward in order that the voter in clear conscience can answer \"Yes\"\r\n\r\nor \"No\".

I think the Members on the Government side should\r\n\r\nalso have regard to what the Chair is trying to do. The Chair has suggested that\r\n\r\nthere should be a winding-up and the Member for Queenstown is probably trying to\r\n\r\ngive effect to the Chair's wishes.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Most of our arguments have already been given in Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, Sir, and Members can always look up the arguments, but I want to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncorrect  the erroneous analysis of the Member for Cairnhill. He was saying  that\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. was committed to a referendum only after the radio forum in September\r\n\r\n1961  and it was because the Barisan Sosialis said \"No, no, no\" that the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndare not have one question, and hence the delay.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you the correct picture of this referendum plot. I would also like\r\n\r\nto  tell you more about how the referendum plot originated, but I think  I  will\r\n\r\nreserve  that  part of it until I come to the amendment on the  announcement  of\r\n\r\ndetails in the electoral divisions. I will just run through it quickly and  tell\r\n\r\nyou  how  the  P.A.P. was committed to the holding of a referendum  long  before\r\n\r\nthat.  It was not without reason that the P.A.P. had decided on a referendum.  A\r\n\r\nreferendum, first of all, need not involve the resignation of  the  Government,\r\n\r\nand secondly, the P.A.P. Ministers' private interests would be served. But, as I\r\n\r\nsay, I will come to that later on.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original intention, as has been correctly said by the Member for Cairnhill, was that one question on the White Paper merger proposals would be put to\r\n\r\nthe  people and that the people would be required to give an answer of \"Yes\"  or\r\n\r\n\"No\".  That  was  clearly indicated in the many communications which  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  let  out.  He  said  that the people  could  reject  or  accept  those\r\n\r\nproposals. He also gave a very graphic explanation in the Nanyang Siang Pau  and\r\n\r\nthe  Sin Chew Jit Poh on 25th September, 1961. There he clearly indicated to the\r\n\r\npeople  how the people could vote. He said if the people did not like the merger\r\n\r\nproposals  put  before them, all they need do was to put a cross  in  the  space\r\n\r\nindicating \"no\", and if they want to support those proposals, they could  put  a\r\n\r\ncross in the space indicating \"yes\". Therefore, Sir, the original intention  was\r\n\r\nto put the White Paper merger proposals before the people and the people were to\r\n\r\nbe  asked one simple question that required the simple answer of \"Yes\" or  \"No\".\r\n\r\nBut  since that day, Sir, there has been widespread opposition and, as correctly\r\n\r\nstated by the Member for Cairnhill, the P.A.P. quickly\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncame  to  realise  that their merger proposals would not be  acceptable  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Therefore, the original plan had to be scrapped and a new one  substitu\r\n\r\nted. Since the original one-question referendum would be a risky business, more\r\n\r\nthan  one question would have to be submitted to the people. Therefore, the plot\r\n\r\nwas to pose two or more unacceptable questions to the electorate. Hence you see,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  the original Bill and even in the present clause 13 of the Bill  there\r\n\r\nare \"questions\" to be posed.\r\n\r\nOf course, the plot was and still is to\r\n\r\npose  the two unacceptable questions - one being the White Paper, which would  he\r\n\r\nthe  less  objectionable of the two unacceptable alternatives. The  people  were\r\n\r\nexpected  to choose the lesser of two evils. This is what I want to  impress  on\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Cairnhill, if the information could be handed to  him.  The  in\r\n\r\ntention,  therefore, under those circumstances, was to have a  snap  referendum,\r\n\r\nblitzkrieg  style, and only five days would be allowed for the  referendum  from\r\n\r\nthe  date  of  notification to the actual date of referendum. That  was  in  the\r\n\r\noriginal  Bill - clauses 6 and 13. Now they have amended the period from  five  to\r\n\r\nseven  days  and from seven to 14 days In the original clause it was  only  five\r\n\r\ndays - to make sure that the Opposition Parties would be prevented from mobilising\r\n\r\nall  their strength for canvassing. They made sure that there would be  complete\r\n\r\nprohibition  of canvassing. That was in the original clause 42. Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nwhole  idea  was  to  limit  and  restrict  the  Opposition's  normal  means  of\r\n\r\ncommunication  with  the masses. No canvassing would be  allowed.  It  would  be\r\n\r\ncomplete  prohibition. Of course, the P.A.P., would have all the  facilities  of\r\n\r\npropaganda  through the unrestricted use of Government machinery, including  the\r\n\r\nradio and Rediffusion. That is found in clause 40. I do not intend to go further\r\n\r\ninto it now, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original plan for a referendum of only one straightforward question that\r\n\r\nrequired  a simple answer of \"yes\" or \"no\", was, therefore, changed and switched\r\n\r\nto  a  referendum of two questions, which made it a choice of two evils. In  the\r\n\r\nconfusion so caused, and with the short period allowed to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople, the P.A.P. had hoped that the\r\n\r\nvoters  might  vote for the White Paper merger proposals. This  was  the  actual\r\n\r\nthinking  and behind-the-scenes plotting before the merger debate. That  is  why\r\n\r\nthe National Referendum Bill had its First Reading on the 27th of November.\r\n\r\nI will only go so far about the plot, but\r\n\r\n1  will  enlarge and go into further details later on. This is just to tell  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill  that  when they tabled the Bill  in  the  Assembly,  the\r\n\r\ndecision  had already been arrived at to have two unacceptable questions  to  be\r\n\r\nposed  to the people. They call this the National Referendum Bill. We hope  that\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will accept the amendment and\r\n\r\nreally  give a chance to the people to say no to the question posed. This  would\r\n\r\nthen make it really a National Referendum Bill and not a P.A.P. Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I just want to take up the last point made by the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill as to the nature of the Bill. Considerable heat has been generated  in\r\n\r\nthe  debate  in the last few days that this is a general Bill. It  would  appear\r\n\r\nthat all the Opposition - the S.P.A., the Workers' Party, the U.P.P.\r\n\r\nand  the  Barisan Sosialis - object to this Referendum Bill being called a general\r\n\r\nBill.  Mr  Speaker, I take it that it is the wish of the Opposition  that  this\r\n\r\nBill  should  not be a general Bill and that it should apply only to  the  refer\r\n\r\nendum  on merger.

I am asking that symbols should be fair and should not work unfairly on\r\n\r\nthe subconscious mind of the voter. If symbols are to be chosen, they should  be\r\n\r\nneutral  and have no religious or other unsavory significance in them.  Here  we\r\n\r\nare asked to put our trust in the correct judgment of the Superintendent. It may\r\n\r\nopen  the Superintendent to criticism of unfairness if he should make a mistake.\r\n\r\nUnder  those  circumstances,  the Superintendent  would  be  placed  in  a  most\r\n\r\ninvidious  position.  To  prevent  all this unhappiness  and  possible  misunder\r\n\r\nstanding,  we  suggest  that the symbols be debated  in  the  Assembly  so  that\r\n\r\nalthough  they may ultimately still have a political bias because of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmajority  in the Assembly, at least the publicity of the debate will enable  the\r\n\r\npeople to know exactly what the symbols are all about.

We  must\r\n\r\nremember,  Sir,  that  certain symbols need explanations, and,  at  the  present\r\n\r\nmoment, the whole of the Government propaganda machinery is in the hands of  one\r\n\r\nParty and it may not allow the other Parties equal opportunity to explain to the\r\n\r\npeople unless we have a debate on this in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member formally move the amendment?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A3, lines 32 to 34, to leave out \"the Superintendent may adopt such\r\n\r\nsymbols as he thinks fit and such symbols shall be printed on the ballot  paper\"\r\n\r\nand insert \"symbols as indicated by the Legislative Assembly shall be printed on\r\n\r\nthe ballot paper.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the House that the symbols\r\n\r\nto  be chosen will not have a religious significance or bear any resemblance  to\r\n\r\nthe symbols of any political Party.

Mr Speaker, the  weather-cock of the P.A.P. has turned from north to south, and east to west, and back to\r\n\r\nnorth,  so that we do not really know where we stand here as to whether this  is\r\n\r\nnow  a  general Referendum Bill or a specific Referendum Bill. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  they  go  into a huddle somewhere and make  up  their  minds  and\r\n\r\nsolemnly assure us on which one it is, so that we know how to argue. If it is  a\r\n\r\ngeneral Referendum Bill, you will appreciate that to give the people seven days'\r\n\r\nnotice in respect of any question is inadequate for the purposes of canvassing\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nand  explaining  to  them the meaning of that question.  If  it  is  a  specific\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill, I would like to add this. You are aware that the Government are\r\n\r\ntaking  credit throughout the country, and when the Member for Cairnhill was  on\r\n\r\nthe  radio  forum,  he  seemed delighted at the assurance  given  by  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  that  in respect of the questions to be asked in this referendum,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would permit a debate on them. I am sorry I was not present,  and  I\r\n\r\ngather  from  the Minister for Finance that the assurance was given  by  him.  I\r\n\r\naccept the correction. I have no doubt it is accurate. An assurance was given by\r\n\r\nhim  that  the Government would permit a debate on the questions to be asked  in\r\n\r\nthe  referendum. That is very generous of the Government. The truth is,  at  the\r\n\r\ntime  they  gave that assurance they were under a constitutional  obligation  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in the debate, because the Opposition had given notice that it would\r\n\r\nbe  seeking  a  debate  on  a motion as to the questions  to  be  posed  in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum.  However, Sir, the purpose of my remark is not to deflate  yet  once\r\n\r\nmore  the  pouter pigeon credit that they seek, to which they are not  entitled,\r\n\r\nbut  merely to say this, that I am conscious of the possibility - I say no more - be\r\n\r\ncause  undertakings by this Government, you have seen, can change from  hour  to\r\n\r\nhour.  We  have been told, Sir, that this is a general Referendum Bill.  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  abused  in  a  most scurrilous fashion. They have  even  indulged  in  the\r\n\r\nimpudence  of  introducing my wife's name. I take strong  exception  to  obscene\r\n\r\npeople  using her name. On top of it now, we have the Minister for Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nsaying  to us that he will scrap this Bill as soon as the merger referendum  has\r\n\r\nbeen put. Are they changing their minds from minute to minute - maybe they and  I\r\n\r\ndo  not speak the same language, Sir, - we will leave it at that. What I want  you\r\n\r\nto notice is this. Assuming for the sake of argument that that part of the assur\r\n\r\nance  given  by the Minister is going to be carried out, that we do not  have  a\r\n\r\nprorogation,  let  us  say,  before we have the motion - they  can  prorogue  this\r\n\r\nAssembly. Now, Sir, assuming then that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  people  will know what the questions are; assuming furthermore  that  those\r\n\r\nquestions will be specified by the Superintendent - because there is no legal duty\r\n\r\non him so far according to this Bill, but let us assume it. Then we come to this\r\n\r\nposition.  I  say that accepting this as specific for the moment, accepting  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  assurances at their full value, nevertheless we  are  left  in  this\r\n\r\nposition.  Though we may know the questions, we will only have a limited  period\r\n\r\nfor  canvassing.  In fairness - and I do not want to mislead anyone-assuming  that\r\n\r\nthey  carry  out  all  the  promises made, which are not  legally  binding,  the\r\n\r\nquestions  will  be known, in fact, when His Excellency orders the  gazetting - gazettes  his  orders to the Superintendent to put to the people the  matter  of\r\n\r\nmerger by way of a referendum. The moment he says, \"Order from His Excellency to\r\n\r\nthe  Superintendent that the matter of merger be put to the people by way  of  a\r\n\r\nreferendum.\"  Then we have got 14 days. In fairness, that would be  correct,  although  we do not know the exact questions for another 7 days. Nevertheless,  if\r\n\r\nthey  keep their word and the questions are here debated, and the same questions\r\n\r\nare  put  by the Superintendent, we will have 14 days. That is taking everything\r\n\r\nthat is favourable. Now, Sir, 14 days. I would suggest to you, in the context of\r\n\r\na  trading  and commercial community where people have to earn their livelihood,\r\n\r\nand  I  am talking of the common people - we in the Assembly on this side are  not\r\n\r\nsupposed to be earning our livelihood; the Government side is doing jolly well.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that in order to educate the people, how shall I say, Sir, to\r\n\r\nthe  issues  during that period and for having mass meetings, and  you  will  re\r\n\r\nmember,  Sir, that the Member for Hong Lim who sought a mass meeting in his  own\r\n\r\nhome  town, on his own home ground, has been refused a licence because  of  some\r\n\r\ntechnicality which I trust\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I do not know, maybe I am trusting\r\n\r\ntoo  much  again: I withdraw that trust. But on the assumption that at  election\r\n\r\ntime the technicalities will be waived\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nand  we  will be permitted at short notice to hold mass rallies - that  gives  us,\r\n\r\nSir,  a  maximum  of  two Sundays - the Sunday immediately  after  His  Excellency\r\n\r\ngazettes the Order and one more Sunday. It gives us two Sundays and two Saturday\r\n\r\nafternoons on which to hold mass rallies at which the people of Singapore  could\r\n\r\nattend.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I say with respect that asking for four weeks is reasonable and surely,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  the context of the obvious insistence of the  Government  that\r\n\r\nseveral  questions will be put, four weeks is not unreasonable; it is necessary.\r\n\r\nI must touch here, Sir - though it is in the Select Committee's Report - on the fact\r\n\r\nthat in Jamaica where they had a special referendum law they specified - and though, Sir, in that law itself the question was clearly enunciated - that\r\n\r\nthe  Governor  must  lay down the date for polling at least six  weeks - forty-two\r\n\r\ndays - from  the date of the proclamation. I am here asking for no more  than  28\r\n\r\ndays between the gazetting of the questions and the polling date. Sir, I am at a\r\n\r\nloss  to  understand the vigorous resistance to a request which is supported  by\r\n\r\nevery  possible precedent that could be thought of. I would draw your  attention\r\n\r\nto  the fact that the Member for Cairnhill voted in favour of this amendment  in\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee.  It  is a minor thing, Sir,I know we were  outvoted  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment - five to all the Opposition four. I do say that asking for 28 days for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of canvassing is the basic reasonable minimum. I will  not  say  I\r\n\r\ntrust  that  the Government will accept it, but I do urge that there  should  be\r\n\r\nunity at least on this side in insisting on it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I formally move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A3, line 37, to leave out \"seven\" and insert \"twenty-eight\"*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The same ammendment also stood in the name of Dr Lee Siew Choh.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when we do not agree with the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson, he says that we are dictatorial, and when we do agree with him, he doubts\r\n\r\nour intentions and our sincerity.

Sir, I should like to come back to this allegation that the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not giving the Opposition time to explain to the people  regarding\r\n\r\nthe  merger  issue.  Nothing  is further from the  truth  than  this  ridiculous\r\n\r\nallegation.  Since the Barisan Sosialis and their newly acquired  mouthpiece  in\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Anson  are only interested in this  specific  case  of  merger\r\n\r\nreferendum, I shall perhaps be permitted to dwell at length on this case.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, the issue of merger, if I remember correctly, was being\r\n\r\ndiscussed  seriously ever since June 1961, following the statement made  by  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime Minister in May 1961. A White Paper on merger was  tabled  for\r\n\r\ndebate  in  the  Legislative  Assembly in November  1961.  The  debate  went  on\r\n\r\nuninterruptedly for three weeks with the Member for Queenstown making his record-breaking seven and a half-hour speech. No one can deny that there was a thorough\r\n\r\nventilation of views on the merger issue in the Assembly. There was,  indeed,  a\r\n\r\nfree,  full and frank discussion. The issue was finally concluded at the end  of\r\n\r\nthree weeks with no dissenting votes on the White Paper. Since then the issue of\r\n\r\nmerger  has  been more intensively discussed in the newspapers, at radio  forums\r\n\r\nand  at mass meetings. Indeed, in the last month the form in which the questions\r\n\r\nwill  take  has  begun to take shape. Surely, information on the issue  for  the\r\n\r\ncoming  referendum  has been given in advance far beyond the  twenty-eight  days\r\n\r\nwhich the Barisan Sosialis and their newly acquired mouthpiece have demanded.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

The charge that the Government is not democratic  in\r\n\r\nnot giving the Opposition sufficient time to explain to the people cannot stand,\r\n\r\nespecially  so  when we have already given an assurance to this House  that  the\r\n\r\nquestion to be put to the people will be debated in this House.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the mover of this amendment, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson,  did  in his opening remarks say that if this Bill was  intended  to\r\n\r\nrefer  to the merger referendum, then he might have different views on the  time\r\n\r\nrequired  for canvassing and for referendum meetings. It was I who suggested  to\r\n\r\nthe Government in my earlier speech that perhaps if they could give an assurance\r\n\r\nthat  this Bill would only be used once for the merger referendum, it would take\r\n\r\nthe  heat off on a number of succeeding proposed amendments. I am glad that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson has given an indication that if it was meant to be  used  only\r\n\r\nonce for the merger referendum, then we might have softer views - not so harsh - but\r\n\r\nsofter views on the matter with regard to this question of time for canvassing.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the other assurance given by the Government is that the questions will be\r\n\r\nfully  debated  in  the Legislative Assembly. They will be  fully  debated  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  the public will be able to get an idea of the pros and cons  of  the\r\n\r\nquestions  to  be  posed. In the light of that assurance, I wonder  whether  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson will be so insistent on the time required for canvassing  and\r\n\r\nfor referendum meetings. But I will assure him that no matter what it is, be  it\r\n\r\n28 days or be it what he thinks is more reasonable, we will support him.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we have all the time been saying that the Government\r\n\r\nhave been very dishonest.

They  were  thus  implying\r\n\r\nindirectly that this Bill was meant for merger. And yet all along they have been\r\n\r\ntrying  to  say that this is a general Referendum Bill. Therefore, you  can  see\r\n\r\nfrom this alone that if the argument suits them, they say that this Bill is  for\r\n\r\nthe referendum on merger. If the argument does not suit them, they say that this\r\n\r\nBill is a general Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is not the case of 200 days or 14 days for the issue. It is not the\r\n\r\nissue that we want to talk about. It is the questions which the people must know\r\n\r\nabout and discuss. If the questions were given early, we would be able to have a\r\n\r\nfull  debate on them. But through the pressure of our arguments and through  the\r\n\r\npressure  of  public opinion - in truth, they are trying to give an appearance  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  on  their  part - they have now given in to  our  insistence  that  the\r\n\r\nquestions should be debated in the Assembly. In fact, in giving the promise  now\r\n\r\nthat  the  questions will be debated in the Assembly, they have already admitted\r\n\r\nthe validity of all our arguments. I only need, Sir, to remind the House that in\r\n\r\nall  other countries the period of canvassing allowed is either six weeks or two\r\n\r\nmonths.  For  example,  in the referendum that is going to  be  carried  out  in\r\n\r\nAlgeria, the notification was given on the 15th of May, and they announced  that\r\n\r\nthe referendum would be held on the 1st of July.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question was given to the people three or four weeks before the date of\r\n\r\nthe  referendum.  Everybody  knew  what  it  was  all  about.  The  Government's\r\n\r\ninsistence of only one week now therefore cannot be defended.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson referred to the Hong Lim by-election and to the Anson by-election - 7 weeks and 5 weeks. Yet the original intention was -, and I suppose it\r\n\r\nstill is - that canvassing after discussion of the question\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwill only be one week. Even the Prime Minister himself, during the Hong Lim  by-\r\n\r\nelection, suggested that seven weeks was not long enough for the P.A.P. to  put\r\n\r\ntheir  views  across to the people. He thought at that time that  if  he  had  a\r\n\r\nlonger period, possibly he might have swung the results the other way round.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing about canvassing, Sir, is this: if you really intend to allow\r\n\r\ncanvassing,  you  must  allow the time and the facilities  for  canvassing.  Gov\r\n\r\nernment  has  full  advantage of the propaganda material  in  Radio  P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nRediffusion; and even the Press is under pressure. I mentioned to you the  other\r\n\r\nday,  Sir, that if the editors of certain newspapers do not toe the line of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. then  pressure is exerted on the newspaper and even its  circulation  is\r\n\r\nthreatened.  For  example,  in  this particular case  of  the  Sunday  Mail,  we\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the editor has now been transferred as a result of negotiations\r\n\r\nbetween  the  people  in  charge of the Straits  Times  and  the  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Just because a headline did not suit the purpose of the P.A.P.,  all\r\n\r\nthis has happened. Sir, a lot of reporters have put in their reports of the  day\r\n\r\nto  the  newspapers, but after sub-editing they just do not see  their  original\r\n\r\nstories  anymore. All because of some frantic telephone calls from the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Culture. This is an open secret, Sir, and I think everybody knows about  it.\r\n\r\nSo,  from  this  alone,  we can see what pressure the Government  exert  on  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers and indirectly on the Opposition Parties. When you come to clause  4,\r\n\r\nSir,  you will see that the P.A.P. do not intend to allow Opposition Parties  to\r\n\r\nput  up posters. I do not intend to say very much on that now, but just to point\r\n\r\nout that they have given an undertaking that they would allow canvassing as in a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election. \"As in a general election\" does not mean seven days; \"general\r\n\r\nelection\" means six or seven weeks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the questions that are going to be put in the referendum will be\r\n\r\ndebated  now  in  the Assembly, it will still take some time for  the  different\r\n\r\nmeanings, and hidden meanings especially, of these questions to be placed before\r\n\r\nthe people. When we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nask  permission for a rally, Sir, they always put difficulties in our way.  They\r\n\r\nallow  us to have our rallies, but they make sure that our preparation  for  the\r\n\r\nrally  is  very strictly limited. Permission is only given almost  at  the  last\r\n\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, this clause ties up\r\n\r\nwith  their  original  intention to have a snap referendum.  But  now  that  the\r\n\r\nquestions are going to be debated, they relax the time period for canvassing  to\r\n\r\na  certain  extent. Even then in relaxing the canvassing period, they limit  our\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  the  minimum, making sure that we cannot  communicate  with  the\r\n\r\npeople as easily as we like. I hope the Government will really live up to  their\r\n\r\npromise of allowing canvassing \"as in a general election\", and if canvassing  is\r\n\r\nto  be  allowed as in the general election then it is a minimum of four  to  six\r\n\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before this Bill went to Select Committee it\r\n\r\nprovided that a notification should be published not later than five days before\r\n\r\nthe date of the referendum.

But when in Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, Mr Speaker, Sir, it was pointed out to the Member for Anson that his\r\n\r\noriginal  amendment was that five days should be amended to ten days, if  I  can\r\n\r\nquote from the Official Report of the Select Committee on the Singapore National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill of 11th May, 1962, No. 4, col. 207, Mr Speaker, Sir, his  reply\r\n\r\nwas \"Never\".

When we agree with them, they say we  change\r\n\r\nour  stand  to suit our purpose; and when we oppose them, they say we are  being\r\n\r\ndictatorial. The Member for Anson has drawn particular attention to the question\r\n\r\nof whether this Bill is a general Referendum Bill or a Bill meant for a specific\r\n\r\nreferendum, and I think he mentioned it several times during the course  of  the\r\n\r\ndebate.  If, as I have said, this Bill could he used for a referendum on merger,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Anson also insisted that it should be employed for a referendum\r\n\r\non merger. But when the Minister for Home Affairs agreed that if that were so he\r\n\r\nwould  be quite prepared to repeal the Bill, the Member for Queenstown  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson said that we changed our stand to suit our  purpose.  On  the\r\n\r\ncharge  of  the  Member for Queenstown that the Opposition do not have  adequate\r\n\r\ntime  to campaign on the question of referendum for merger, Members of the House\r\n\r\nwill  remember that in the debate on a motion moved some months back, we pointed\r\n\r\nout  to  the  House that the Ban-san had jumped the gun long ago.

That  is  a  falsehood,  Mr  Speaker - a  plain\r\n\r\nfalsehood. I have all along insisted that this Bill is inappropriate for  a\r\n\r\nmerger,  that we should have a specific merger Referendum Bill.  They  have\r\n\r\nconsistently denied it. They say that I made the issue as to whether it  is\r\n\r\nspecific  or  general - I  made  the  issue  to  show  with  contempt   their\r\n\r\ndishonesty - how  if one thing suits them it is one thing and  when  it  does\r\n\r\nnot,  it  is another. When it was debated on the Second Reading,  everybody\r\n\r\nsaid it was\r\n\r\nspecific.  Then the fantastic exhibition throughout the Select Committee -   'This\r\n\r\nis  general. This is general.\" And when we come back here, the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister - not being here when I draw attention to it - comes in and  puts  his\r\n\r\nfoot  into it, and says, \"This is general, this is general\". When it is  ex\r\n\r\nposed  to  the public gaze, to a point where nobody can miss it,  they  now\r\n\r\nsay  it  is  specific. I say again, the Jamaican Referendum Bill was  short\r\n\r\nand  simple  with  a few clauses. Why should we not have it?  And  this  is\r\n\r\npertinent because the Minister - I think I can say which Minister it  was,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  was the Minister for Law -  said, \"In every legislation which  pro\r\n\r\nvided  for  a specific referendum, the question was framed in the Ordinance\r\n\r\nitself.\" That was said this afternoon, Sir. That is what I am seeking,  and\r\n\r\nthat is what is being denied, and that is what is important.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this alleged concession is no concession at all. We knew exactly what\r\n\r\nwas  meant, and we pointed out that there was no other referendum  in  view\r\n\r\nbut  the  idea of having a specific-cum-general Bill is merely in order  to\r\n\r\nhave  flexibility  for  dishonest  manoeuvre.

Their original intention\r\n\r\nwas  only  five  days, then it was changed to seven days, and now  the  question\r\n\r\nitself will be debated. So all their giving way on the question is because  they\r\n\r\nwant to pose themselves as democrats. We have criticised them so much, Sir, that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot take it any more. Public opinion is pressing them and they have  to\r\n\r\ngive  in some way or other. All because they have a sure win referendum in their\r\n\r\nclause  29.  Under those circumstances, they think they can relax, but  even  in\r\n\r\nrelaxing they want to make sure that canvassing will only be limited to  a  very\r\n\r\nshort period, and during that short period no posters will be allowed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani</b> rose-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Bani, on this\r\n\r\nissue?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Yes.

We asked that the matter to be put to the people be first\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in  this  Assembly, so that the people can be fully  aware  of  their\r\n\r\narguments  for  and against that question, but the Government  rejected  it.  We\r\n\r\nasked  that  only  one question be posed in the referendum, so that  the  people\r\n\r\nwould not become confused, but the Government rejected it. Now, Sir, we ask that\r\n\r\nthe  people be given more time so that they could fully understand and  consider\r\n\r\ncarefully  the  question  before they vote, but the  Government  is  once  again\r\n\r\nrejecting it. Sir, it is important. It may be a bit tedious but, nevertheless, I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is important to realise, particularly on an issue of this  magnitude,\r\n\r\nwhy in fact the Government is behaving like this.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason the Government gave for rejecting this amendment in Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  was  that if more time were given, the people would  be  confused.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  was  the  Minister for Home Affairs who moved  this  amendment.  He\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  if  more time were given, it would allow  unscrupulous  men  to\r\n\r\nconfuse the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> It has been done.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> And he had one Mr Oon\r\n\r\nPeet  Fong  who made representation to the Select Committee on the  same  lines.\r\n\r\nSir, to suggest that if the people were given more time to consider the question\r\n\r\nthey  would become confused is, in fact, an insult to the people. Does  not  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leadership at least have some respect for the intelligence of the people?\r\n\r\nIs  the P.A.P. seriously saying that our people are so foolish that if more time\r\n\r\nwere given, they would be confused?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you are aware that prior to and even during the 1959 elections the same\r\n\r\nsuggestion  was made by the S.P.A. There was the suggestion that the P.A.P. won\r\n\r\nthe elections because they confused the people. And it was people like the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and various others who denied this. They said, \"No, our electorate is a\r\n\r\nsophisticated electorate; they are intelligent enough to choose the policies one\r\n\r\nstands for and not the individuals themselves.\" For example, the people of  Hong\r\n\r\nLim were given\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nseven  weeks  to  decide. This was longer than the time given  for  the  general\r\n\r\nelections. Those seven weeks, Sir, were given by the P.A.P. Government. Does the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. agree  that  it gave seven weeks longer than the period  given  for  the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> They already got 7-plus!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Longer than normal because they wanted to confuse the people? The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister says they have already had longer than seven weeks. We have  had\r\n\r\nlonger than seven weeks to discuss and decide in the face of restrictions on the\r\n\r\nPress,  and  in  the face of restrictions on the availability of  media  to  put\r\n\r\nforward  our  views,  notwithstanding that we have had a  longer  time.  But  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss  what?  To discuss whether we want merger or not. In 1959 everybody  was\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Yes.  Merger  is  the next constitutional step.\"  But,  Sir,  in  this\r\n\r\nreferendum  it  is  not important whether one wants merger or  not,  but  rather\r\n\r\nwhether  the  question  posed is understood. Even if  they  were  to  bring  the\r\n\r\nquestion  to  this  Assembly for debate, one may not fear a  longer  period  for\r\n\r\ncanvassing, or for allowing all political Parties to explain to the people their\r\n\r\npoints  of  view.  And there is no need to have this lack of confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nintelligence of the people to decide definitely one way or the other.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>8.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the elections were over, the Prime Minister suggested that had a\r\n\r\nlonger time - longer than seven weeks\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- been given for canvassing, perhaps the tables would have been turned on the\r\n\r\nMember  for Hong Lim. Was he then, Mr Speaker, Sir, suggesting that  if  longer\r\n\r\ntime  had  been  given, the P.A.P. would have confused the people  and  won  the\r\n\r\nelections?  I  have not heard arguments more absurd than the one the  P.A.P. is\r\n\r\nputting  forward in defence of this undemocratic Bill. This is because they  are\r\n\r\nvulnerable and their arguments are untenable.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in opposing this amendment moved by the Member for Queenstown, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs said in Select Committee that the Government could\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nnot  agree  because this was a general Referendum Bill and that  the  Government  might  have  to ask any number of questions. Sir,  the  Minister  here\r\n\r\nwanted  to  reserve  the  right for the Government to  pose  any  number  of\r\n\r\nquestions, 20 questions if necessary. But in opposing it, the Minister  also\r\n\r\nsaid  that in a referendum only one or just two questions would be  put  and\r\n\r\nthat,  therefore, there was no need to have a longer period  given  for  the\r\n\r\npeople to consider the issues.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the Government wants to preserve the right to put as many\r\n\r\nquestions as they want, and on the other hand, they want not more than  seven\r\n\r\ndays  given for the people to consider the questions. Sir, who is  trying  to\r\n\r\nconfuse the people? Whatever the\r\n\r\nMinister  says, Sir, we know for a fact that this Bill is primarily for the  purpose  of  pushing  through  the  unfair merger  arrangements.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance said at col. 181 of the Official Report of  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  on the Singapore National Referendum Bill, No. 4, dated 11th  May,\r\n\r\n1962:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Let us come down to brass tacks. This referendum will be about merger.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is admitted. That is so. We also know, Sir, that to get through this\r\n\r\nunfair  merger arrangement, the Government has not only to rig the referendum\r\n\r\nhut also to confuse the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the basic P.A.P. theme that we should understand if we are to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  P.A.P. wriggling in and out of contradictory arguments.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment does not want to pose just one question, viz. \"Are you in  support\r\n\r\nof  the  merger arrangement on terms contained in the White Paper?\",  because\r\n\r\nthe  people's  answer is going to be a categorical \"No\".  So  they  want  the\r\n\r\nright  to  pose more than one question. They want the right to  pose  perhaps\r\n\r\ntwo unacceptable alternatives in a context where the people have no right  to\r\n\r\nsay  \"no\" and where they cannot abstain. The Government does not want, at the\r\n\r\nsame  time, to give sufficient time for canvassing, because it knows that  if\r\n\r\nsufficient  time  is  given the people will know the  P.A.P.'s  strategy.  In\r\n\r\nfact, Mr\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Bill in its original form gave no opportunity for  canvassing\r\n\r\nat  all.  Why are they afraid of facing the people and of putting forward  their\r\n\r\ncase and giving the right to the Opposition Parties to do the same?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, the Government, in effect, wants to give seven days of very\r\n\r\nrestricted canvassing on the referendum. But since the Select Committee convened\r\n\r\nand  up  to the time of the sitting of this House, the Government wanted to  prohibit  completely canvassing. The reason why today the Government is willing  to\r\n\r\nallow  even this very restricted canvassing is because of the pressure it faces.\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people  and because it finds that the resistance to the  undemocratic\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  this Bill is very strong from the people and the  organisations.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, they now seek to appear reasonable. But everyone knows that  al\r\n\r\nlowing  seven days of very restricted canvassing is not being reasonable by  any\r\n\r\nstretch of the imagination.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That the word proposed to be left out, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Division, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee divided: Ayes, 20; Noes, 23; Absent, 8.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n       Ayes.

Government will  permit\r\n\r\nthe Assembly to debate the questions to be asked in this referendum? If they are\r\n\r\nso  informed, I trust they will keep that information in mind during the  debate\r\n\r\non  this  amendment. If they do so, they will not repeat the ugly exhibition  of\r\n\r\ncontradicting each other and themselves which we have witnessed on the  question\r\n\r\nwhether  this was a general or specific Referendum Bill. In March,  we  had  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, the Minister for Law, and the Minister for Finance tell us  that\r\n\r\nit  was  a  specific Bill for merger. In April, the Deputy Prime Minister  in  a\r\n\r\nsolemn\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmotion  told  us it was only for the merger. In May, we had in Select  Committee\r\n\r\nthe  extraordinary exhibition of forgetfulness on the part of the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLaw,  the  Minister for Home Affairs, and the Minister for Finance of what  they\r\n\r\nthemselves and their Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister had said.  To  cap\r\n\r\nit  all,  yesterday we had the Deputy Prime Minister tell us this is  a  general\r\n\r\nNational Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\nWell  now let us come down to clause 13 of this National Referendum Bill now  no\r\n\r\nlonger  general. In my amendment, I asked that the questions be  framed  by  the\r\n\r\nAssembly. Now that the Minister for Home Affairs, having recognised the error of\r\n\r\nhis  ways,  is going back to the original intention and saying that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nspecific  Bill, I would remind him of some remarks he listened to with  a  broad\r\n\r\nand  pleased  countenance at the magnificent acumen of his  colleague.  I  would\r\n\r\nrefer  to the 8th of May, Sir, column 110, No. 3, of the Official Report of  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill. It is very pertinent\r\n\r\nin this context because\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- need I remind you, Sir? - all I ask is that the questions be framed by the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly. Now, Sir, column 110, we have Mr Byrne, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLaw, here. May I refer to one-third of the way down, Sir, so as not to weary you\r\n\r\nby reading too far? It is about 15 lines down, Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'My point here, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that this is a general referendum Bill.\r\n\r\nIf there was before the Committee a Bill dealing with a\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nspecific  referendum issue, there is nothing to prevent the Legislative Assembly\r\n\r\nfrom deciding the questions to be put to a Referendum. But in this case, this is\r\n\r\na general Referendum\r\n\r\nBill. . . .'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now we have it on the assurance\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister  for Home Affairs that this is a specific Referendum  Bill - you\r\n\r\nhave  got  a  somersault.  Will the Minister for Law  concede - and  I  trust  his\r\n\r\ncolleagues  too - that there is nothing to prevent the Legislative  Assembly  from\r\n\r\ndeciding  the questions to be put? May I also remind this House that we  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  Hansard, that earlier this afternoon the Minister for Law from a  prepared\r\n\r\nspeech said to us that it is\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntrue in every specific referendum law he could trace, the question was framed by\r\n\r\nthe  legislative authority that framed the Act? Now, Sir, need I add more?  That\r\n\r\nis all I seek here.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is not the purpose of\r\n\r\nthis amendment for my standing up here to do more than to point their own volte-face.  I  would be very happy if we could now just take a vote quietly and  bury\r\n\r\ntheir own shame.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  really surprised at the ignorance of the Member for Anson  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter. There is no constitutional precedent anywhere in the world where  it  is\r\n\r\nwritten  in  the  law  to provide for the Legislature to  do  the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nExecutive. The framing of the question is an executive action of the Government,\r\n\r\nfor  the  simple  reason  that if the Legislature is  allowed  to  do  executive\r\n\r\nfunctions of this character, then there might as well not be a Cabinet.  Let  me\r\n\r\nnow  quote what the Member for Queenstown said in the Select Committee. This  is\r\n\r\nthe Official Report of the Select Committee on the Singapore National Referendum\r\n\r\nBill, No. 3, 8th of May, 1962, column 78, the last paragraph. We were discussing\r\n\r\nwhether  the Head of State should be advised by the Government or the  Assembly.\r\n\r\nThis is the same principle. Now, this is what the Member for Queenstown said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The suggestion [that is, the Head of State to be advised by the Assembly]\r\n\r\nwill also allow the elected representatives and political\r\n\r\nParties  to  discuss  the  issue. Although we realise  that  discussion  in  the\r\n\r\nAssembly ultimately means that the view of the majority, namely, the Government,\r\n\r\nwill  still prevail, we feel that in the discussion and in the debate many  good\r\n\r\npoints will be brought forth,...'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Member for Queenstown is only\r\n\r\nasking  that  the  issue be brought up in the Assembly for debate  so  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  will have an opportunity to air their views. And then  far  from  we\r\n\r\nbeing  forgetful as alleged by the Member for Anson - may I quote what he said  in\r\n\r\nSelect Committee at column\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n94  of the same Official Report, somewhere in the middle of the column. This  is\r\n\r\nwhat the Member for Anson said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We are not asking that the Opposition should have the right to dictate what\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should  ask. We are asking that we should  have  the  right  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in a debate whereby we [that is, the Member for Anson and the  other\r\n\r\nOpposition Members] could guide the Government on the issue.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Here  it  is  clearly stated in black and white that he is not asking  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition should have the right to dictate what the Government should ask. Now,\r\n\r\nbe  that as it may, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are going to move immediately after the\r\n\r\nThird Reading of this Bill a motion containing the actual questions to be put to\r\n\r\nthe  people  for debate in this Assembly. The Member for Anson will  have  ample\r\n\r\nopportunity to discuss the question.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we see the dishonesty of the P.A.P. Government in\r\n\r\nevery  clause of the Bill. In fact, Sir, I wonder if you notice it - they  are  so\r\n\r\ncrestfallen all of a sudden. Mr Speaker, Sir, something must be happening.  You\r\n\r\nwill notice their faces - all of a sudden they are long, like those of horses.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hope the Member for Queenstown has not looked at the\r\n\r\nSpeaker's face also.

They say it is meant for different types of smoking, the sale\r\n\r\nof  toddy.  In fact, Sir, I have already marked this paragraph out for quotation\r\n\r\nand  I  am glad that the Member for Anson has quoted it because this is a  clear\r\n\r\nadmission from the Minister for Health and Law that he is the expert on whom the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance depended. I refer you to column 107 of the Official  Report\r\n\r\nof  the Select Committee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill, No. 3, dated\r\n\r\n8th May, 1962, Sir:\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I give two reasons why these amendments are unacceptable.\r\n\r\nFirst, it contravenes, on the authority of my colleague, -'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell,  this  is the authority of his colleague, and what does he say  in  column\r\n\r\n110?

That is a fact. If it  is\r\n\r\na  general Bill, questions have got to be set and it will be the Government that\r\n\r\nwill have to accept the responsibility for setting those questions. But you have\r\n\r\nheard the undertaking given by the Minister for Home Affairs just now that  even\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Third Reading of this Bill the questions will be brought  here  for\r\n\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>9.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has always accused us of having\r\n\r\nshort  memories.

I do not see why it should be necessary for a Minister  of\r\n\r\nthe Government and for some Members of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nOpposition to bring in extraneous matters, try to stand on their dignity and try\r\n\r\nto  tear  one another down by flinging back and forth words of abuse,  words  of\r\n\r\ndistrust and words that are bound to heat up the debate unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what we are very concerned about is that the questions should be fully\r\n\r\ndebated in this Assembly and decided upon before they are posed in a referendum.\r\n\r\nSir,  we would like to see that written into the law, but the Minister said.  It\r\n\r\ncould  not be done. They reserve their constitutional right. The assurance given\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister that a motion will be before this House for debate  after  the\r\n\r\nThird  Reading  of  the Bill makes me think that it might be a quicker  process.\r\n\r\nBecause if it were written into the law, then there would have to be more delay,\r\n\r\nand  it  would be necessary for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to give assent.  That\r\n\r\ntakes  time and later on the Government will have to come to this House  with  a\r\n\r\nmotion  for the questions to be debated.

That is the  constitutional\r\n\r\nposition.  He has heard his colleagues refer to the Newfoundland Referendum  Act\r\n\r\nof  1948.  Perhaps he thinks that is unconstitutional? He has seen the  Jamaican\r\n\r\nReferendum  Act  of  1960.  Is that unconstitutional? What  constitution  is  he\r\n\r\nthinking of?

This is all my amendment asks. My amendment asks  for\r\n\r\nit  to  be  written  into  the law that the questions as  debated  will  be  the\r\n\r\nquestions  put.  Both  Ministers,  who  obviously  do  not  understand   English\r\n\r\nadequately, have quoted passages, Sir, wherein we have pointed out to them  that\r\n\r\nwe  are  not  asking  to dictate. This clause does not ask that  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nshould  dictate the question. It asks that the questions should be  incorporated\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill, and the Government, with its majority, can always have what  ques\r\n\r\ntions  it  will. All we ask is that in this Bill there should be a law that  the\r\n\r\nquestions as debated by this Assembly\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- where the Government has the majority and where it can bulldoze what questions\r\n\r\nit  will - will  be the questions put and none other. This is not a  clause  which\r\n\r\nwill  remedy the Bill. It will improve it a little. Because, unquestionably,  it\r\n\r\nstill leaves it to the Government to put two or a hundred filthy alternatives to\r\n\r\nthe  people. But it does at least insist that the questions as debated  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  will  be  the  questions put to the people.  This  is  what  has  been\r\n\r\npromised. Why the objection now to its incorporation?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must confess, Sir, I cannot understand why the Member for Cairnhill, says\r\n\r\nthat he accepts the assurances when' he has had repeated proof of their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsomersault?

We find sub-clause (4) says that the list\r\n\r\nprepared  by  the  Superintendent  shall be  delivered  to  the  Registration Officer,  and  then sub-clause (5) -  the sub-clause which I seek to  amend - says\r\n\r\nthat the Registration Officer will delete from the register the names of  all\r\n\r\npersons  who have not voted. Now, what happens to those people - some  of  whom\r\n\r\nmay  be  away  from  Singapore, some of whom may be sick on  that  day?  What\r\n\r\nhappens  to them when their names are taken off the register? We  then  come\r\n\r\nto sub-clause (8) - they  must satisfy the Registrar that they had a good reason or  they  must\r\n\r\npay  $5. Now, Mr Mammen, Sir, that is not onerous and that is perfectly fair\r\n\r\nand  I  accept  it.  But notice the last three lines: \"Such  names  shall  be\r\n\r\nrestored to the register ... at the next ensuing revision     ...\" And  that  is\r\n\r\nthe  rub.  These  people who may, through no fault of their  own,  have  been\r\n\r\nprevented from voting are deprived of the right to vote until after the  next\r\n\r\nrevision of the register and that may he two years, or three years,  or  four\r\n\r\nyears.  Sir,  it can be said that this is identical with a clause  introduced\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Cairnhill when he was Chief Minister and made the  voting\r\n\r\ncompulsory. That may be so. In fact, I think it is correct.

Take  anybody,  Sir.\r\n\r\nTake a humble servant who is sick. Take somebody who has gone to Hongkong or to\r\n\r\nPenang. Now, why should they be deprived of the basic rights of citizens to vote\r\n\r\nand  stand for election because they were absent from Singapore on that  day?  I\r\n\r\ncan  find  absolutely  no  answer to what seems to  be  a  perfectly  legitimate\r\n\r\nrequest, that before a man's name is struck off the register, he should he given\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  to say why he did not vote and if the answer is  satisfactory,\r\n\r\nthen  to leave his name on the register hut if his answer is unsatisfactory,  to\r\n\r\nrequest  him to pay the $5 fine which we authorise, if he pays the $5  fine,  to\r\n\r\nleave his name on the register. But if he refuses to answer, refuses to pay  the\r\n\r\n$5,  refuses to come, then take his name off the register.

I  think  in\r\n\r\nthis  case particularly, we should consider the practical implications  of  what\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson proposed. I can assure you, Mr Mammen, that the amendments\r\n\r\nsuggested by the Member for Anson are an administratively impossible task.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 is taken out word for word from a similar section in the Singapore\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly  Elections  Ordinance.  I  am  sure  that  when  the  last\r\n\r\nGovernment  passed the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance,  this\r\n\r\nsection must have been fully considered and the implications fully thought  out.\r\n\r\nHowever, I shall give some facts and figures concerning this particular  clause,\r\n\r\nsince  we  have had one general election and two by-elections over the last  few\r\n\r\nyears.  And  from  the  facts,  hon. Members in this  House  will  realise  how\r\n\r\nimpractical is the\r\n\r\namendments of the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a general election in 1959, the non-voters numbered about 59,000, which\r\n\r\nwas about ten per cent of the\r\n\r\n'electorate. Of this number, a substantial portion represented persons  who  had\r\n\r\nthings  their  addresses since the registers were certified and, therefore,  did\r\n\r\nnot  receive the poll card which informed them of the polling station  at  which\r\n\r\nthey  were  to vote. This resulted in their not going to vote at all.  Among  the\r\n\r\nothers, a portion represented those who had left the country or had died.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, under the Member for Anson's amendment, notices should he sent to all\r\n\r\nsuch persons informing them that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithin 28 days they should either pay $5 or give good reasons for not voting.\r\n\r\nMr Mammen, no one can expect such persons to reply if notices are sent to them,\r\n\r\nas  the  notices will not reach them. Moreover, the time taken to send  out  the\r\n\r\nnotices  will be considerable, depending upon the number of nonvoters.  Assuming\r\n\r\nthat all those who received the notices replied, it would take considerable time\r\n\r\nfor  the enquiry to be completed in respect of all these cases - extending to some\r\n\r\nmonths  and on occasions going beyond the date due for the next revision of  the\r\n\r\nelectoral  registers.  If the number of non-voters who  have  replied  is,  e.g.\r\n\r\n40,000,  it  would take 200 workers to complete the enquiry at the rate  of  200\r\n\r\ncases  a  day. The names o, these electors cannot be expunged from the registers\r\n\r\nuntil  their  cases have been adjudicated upon by the Registration  Officer.  If\r\n\r\nthere should be an election in the meantime, all these persons would be able  to\r\n\r\nvote  as their names would still be in the registers. This, in fact, means  that\r\n\r\nwhile on the one hand we agree on compulsory voting, on the other band, we  make\r\n\r\nit so laborious and burdensome for the administrative machinery to carry out the\r\n\r\nprovisions  relating thereto. Further piecemeal deletions and additions  to  the\r\n\r\nregisters  resulting from prolonged enquiries are likely to cause  confusion  in\r\n\r\nthe mechanical processes involved in the preparation of the registers. A further\r\n\r\npoint is that the names of non-voters are not deleted from the registers without\r\n\r\ntheir  knowledge, as claimed by the Member for Anson. Every elector in Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  by  now  be  aware of the provisions for compulsory voting  and  that  the\r\n\r\ninitial  penalty for not voting is the removal of his name from the register  of\r\n\r\nelectors. If an elector does not vote at an election, he must expect  his  name\r\n\r\nto be deleted from the register.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now give the figures of nonvoters at the general elections and at the\r\n\r\nHong Lim and Anson by-elections, and the number of applications received for the\r\n\r\nrestoration  of names, in the case of the general election, the number  of  non-voters is 58,850. The number of applications for restoration of names is\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n6,413.  In  the  case of the Hong Lim by-election, the number of  non-voters  is\r\n\r\n1,072,  and the number of applications for restoration of names is 227.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase of the Anson by-election, the number of non-voters is 1,384, and the number\r\n\r\nof applications for restoration of names is 32.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen that even after three years since the general elections, only\r\n\r\n6,400 applications out of 58,000 for restoration of names were received. And the\r\n\r\nposition  at Hong Lim and Anson even more shows how indifferent people are  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  the restoration of names on the electoral registers, and as  I  said\r\n\r\n(and  probably the Member for Cairnhill is correct on this point) a large number\r\n\r\nof these voters were probably in the grave.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Mammen, Sir, apart from the administrative difficulties con\r\n\r\nnected  with  the  implementation of the procedure proposed by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson,  tinder  the  procedure proposed by him, the elector who  has  failed  to\r\n\r\nrecord  his vote will be treated with the tenderness which he does not  deserve.\r\n\r\nSurely it is the duty of every citizen to record his vote where voting is compul\r\n\r\nsory. And if he fails to do so for any reason whatsoever, the onus should surely\r\n\r\nbe  on  him  to apply for the restoration of his name on the electoral register.\r\n\r\nThe  onus being properly placed on the elector, who has failed to vote, to apply\r\n\r\nfor  the  restoration of his name on the electoral register, it follows that  he\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  wait until the next ensuing revision of the electoral  register\r\n\r\nbefore his name is, in fact, restored to the electoral register as such revision\r\n\r\nof  the electoral register cannot be made on a piecemeal basis. Nor is there any\r\n\r\ninjustice done to him if before the next ensuing revision of the register he  is\r\n\r\ndeprived of an opportunity of exercising his vote if a by-election, an election,\r\n\r\nor a referendum is held in the interval. Furthermore the knowledge that there is\r\n\r\nthis  penalty  will  be an added stimulus as it will serve  as  a  deterrent  to\r\n\r\nelectors  keeping away from the poll and will encourage a larger  attendance  at\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npolls,  thereby helping to achieve the objects for which compulsory  voting  had\r\n\r\nbeen introduced. I cannot see how it can be contended that this is undemocratic.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Mammen, it must surprise you, Sir, the extraordinary in\r\n\r\ncapacity  of  the  Government Benchers to understand  elementary  humanity.  The\r\n\r\nMinister says that I seek exceptional tenderness towards a defaulting voter  and\r\n\r\nhe  does  not  deserve to be treated tenderly. I pointed out to you,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthere are people who have legitimate reasons for being unable to go to the poll.\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  commercial city. Many of us travel.  They  could  be  away  on\r\n\r\nperfectly legitimate business. Do they deserve added penalty? Are they criminals\r\n\r\nif  they  do not find their way to the polling booth on polling day?  Do  people\r\n\r\nseek  to be sick? You know, Mr Mammen, Sir, that there is not a day in the year\r\n\r\nwhen  each of our hospitals is not full of adult citizens, who are so  ill  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot go to a polling booth. Do they deserve added penalty? What talk  is\r\n\r\nthis?  When  the  Member  for Cairnhill introduced this section,  there  was  no\r\n\r\nthought  of  a  penalty other than the penalty of $5. That is why there  is  the\r\n\r\nprovision that if he satisfies the Superintendent or Registration Officer,  then\r\n\r\nhe does not have to pay a penalty at all if he has got a legitimate reason. That\r\n\r\nis that. That is fair enough. If he has not got a legitimate reason, he is fined\r\n\r\n$5. That was the only penalty thought of, Mr Mammen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. now having discovered that, in fact, there is this added injustice\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- not penalty - seek to make a penalty for those who have committed no wrong. They\r\n\r\nsay  that  there  is administrative difficulty. Mr Mammen, Sir,  curiously  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Home Affairs has himself admitted inferentially that at a  general\r\n\r\nelection they issued some 600,000 notices addressed to the electors. (I hear  no\r\n\r\ndissent.) In that case where is the administrative difficulty of issuing  49,000\r\n\r\nafter  the  election,  which  is  ten  per cent  of  the  difficulty  originally\r\n\r\nexperienced?  Now,  Sir, out of that 49,000, you might get 7,000  replies.  Fair\r\n\r\nenough. Immediately you get the others automatically expunged from the register.\r\n\r\nAnd as\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhas  been indicated quite clearly, there are a number who die each year,  Mr\r\n\r\nMammen,  Sir,  and they would naturally not reply. But the majority  of  the\r\n\r\n7,000 who do reply may have perfectly legitimate reasons. Why should we  not\r\n\r\ntreat  them with the same respect which is due to honest citizens who  have\r\n\r\ncommitted  no  wrong?  Why  this  talk of  added  penalties?  What  is  this\r\n\r\nadministrative difficulty? There is nothing possible, Sir, to  the  man  who\r\n\r\ndoes  not want to do it; and there is nothing impossible or little to  those\r\n\r\nwho genuinely make an effort.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find the excuses specious, and in one instance - not surprisingly seeing\r\n\r\nthe source - inhuman.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Mammen,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  all  know that the Member for Anson is full of human kindness.

Ministers. You see, Sir, I have put in this amendment to say that\r\n\r\nthe exact details of the results should be made known to the people. But the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government want to keep it a secret because, as I go along, you will  see\r\n\r\nthat that secret is only meant for the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. They want to know the detailed\r\n\r\nresults  of the various divisions, but nobody else will know it. Then  from  the\r\n\r\nnumber of votes cast for the P.A.P. proposals, they can find out what support  the P.A.P. has in the various divisions. That is the plot which I am going\r\n\r\nto reveal, and I will do so step by step.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I do not think we should go into very many details. An\r\n\r\nallegation  can  be  made, of course, and the Member is entitled  to  make  that\r\n\r\nallegation.  But  I do not think we should go into too many deaths  about  that,\r\n\r\nbecause  those details become irrelevant to the amendment itself. An  allegation\r\n\r\nof  that nature, I suppose, is perfectly legitimate in urging the amendment. But\r\n\r\nif  the  hon.  Member goes into details, we will enter into a  debate  within  a\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will then not go into details and I will only give you the\r\n\r\nbrief outline.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you the general picture so that you may grasp exactly what it is\r\n\r\nall  about.  Although at that period there was talk of throwing in  the  sponge,\r\n\r\nthere  was also the fear of the Ministers that they would not be able to  regain\r\n\r\ntheir  seats should there be a general election. Hence, the idea of a referendum\r\n\r\nwas  mooted. At that time, immediately after the Hong Lim by-election, we had  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  discussions, Sir, and we were asked to give our views as to whether  or\r\n\r\nnot the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                              \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government should stay in office, and whether the referendum  should  be\r\n\r\nheld before or after Anson. There are a lot of details which many people do  not\r\n\r\nknow  about.  They are directly linked with the amendment which I  have  put  in\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originally, the referendum, even from this little bit that I have told you,\r\n\r\nwas meant to find \"safe\" seats for the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nEven at that period, the P.A.P. realised\r\n\r\nthat  if  any referendum was going to be held, only one straightforward question\r\n\r\nwas  to  be  put  to the people. The people were supposed to be asked,  \"Do  you\r\n\r\nsupport the P.A.P. Government?\" Yes or No? That was all. But, of course,  later\r\n\r\non, they changed their ideas.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then explain how this idea of \"safe\" seats was to work. You see, Sir,\r\n\r\nonce the votes have been cast, the constituencies which show the biggest pro\r\n\r\nP.A.P. majority margins would be the\r\n\r\nfirst-class \"safe\" seats; those with smaller majority margins would  be  second-class  \"not-so-safe\" seats; and a sim majority margin would be  the  third-class\r\n\r\n\"unsafe\"  seats.  Of  course, if there should be a general  election,  then  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  would  be assigned to all the first-class \"safe\"  seats;  the  Parliamentary  Secretaries and some of the blue-eyed boys would  be  assigned  to  the\r\n\r\nsecond-class  \"not-so-safe\" seats; and some of the other people  would  have  to\r\n\r\ntake their chances with the third-class \"unsafe\" seats.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see from this that the original intention of the P.A.P. in a referendum\r\n\r\nwas  not  to  find out whether or not the people wanted to accept  their  merger\r\n\r\nproposals,  but  to cater for the selfish interests of the P.A.P.  Ministers  themselves. \r\n\r\nNow in the Bill itself, the P.A.P. plot is not to reveal all these facts\r\n\r\nto  the  people, and depending on how the votes are cast, the P.A.P. hope  to\r\n\r\nfind out which seats would be safe for them. And after this referendum, if there\r\n\r\nis a general election, their Ministers - especially, I suppose, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand the Minister for Finance - would be going to those first-class \"safe\" seats to\r\n\r\nmake sure that they come in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have moved this amendment, Sir, in\r\n\r\norder  to  ensure  that there would be no secret kept from the  people.  If  the\r\n\r\nvoting tells us that so many votes support the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. merger proposals, so many votes\r\n\r\nsupport  any proposition which they may suggest to the people as an alternative,\r\n\r\nor any other alternative, then all those detailed results must be revealed: and\r\n\r\nall the people of Singapore must know about them. Then even if they intend that\r\n\r\ncertain  safe seats should only be known to themselves, at least all the  people\r\n\r\nin Singapore will also share the same secret.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the Minister for Home Affairs stated that the referendum had\r\n\r\noriginally been mentioned in July, he made a slight error. He should  have  said\r\n\r\n\"In  May  after Hong Lim.\" I can even tell you, Sir, that when the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries  were  asked  what the P.A.P. should do  at  that  time,  there  was\r\n\r\npersuasion  used in many forms. We were given dinners. They were hoping  thereby\r\n\r\nto soften our jaw, so to speak, and we were expected to agree to the suggestions\r\n\r\nthat were put to us with regard to the holding of a referendum after Hong Lim.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of order, Sir.

It is only a question of procedure. I notice that when\r\n\r\nthe  Member reads Hansard, he reads the name of the Member. That is strictly not\r\n\r\ncorrect.  Even  when he reads, he ought to say, \"The Minister for  Finance  said\r\n\r\nthis\", or \"the Minister for Law said this\" or \"I said this\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In column 295, Sir, I was asking about how, a recount was\r\n\r\ngoing to be taken. And the Minister for Finance said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Therefore, if there is a recount, my guess is that it will be a recount of\r\n\r\nall the votes cast and not division by division.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Now let us see. If there is provision for recount, how do we ask for a recount if\r\n\r\nwe do not know the detailed results? If you will remember, Sir, in the general\r\n\r\nelections,  the  S.P.A. candidate for River Valley lost by five  votes  to  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Member for River Valley. There were two recounts. They had the  detailed\r\n\r\nresults and they could ask for a recount. But on this occasion, Sir, there is  a\r\n\r\nprovision for a recount and we do not know how to ask for a recount. Surely  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is not gong to suggest that we have to wait until the total result of\r\n\r\nthe  whole island is announced before we ask for a recount? Under those circumstances, bow can our counting agents know when to ask for a recount? If you read\r\n\r\nthe Bill, Sir, there is provision for a request for a recount to be asked by the\r\n\r\ncounting agent. But the counting agent will not be able to ask for a recount  if\r\n\r\nthe  detailed results are not made known to him. So what happens? Sir, my  amendment  here  also, as directed by Mr Mammen, is related to clause 30  about  the\r\n\r\nstatement of voting. I have moved this amendment in order to get a statement  of\r\n\r\nthe voting in the Schedule to the Bill in order that the people of Singapore may\r\n\r\nknow  exactly how they have voted in a referendum. Any honest government,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwill  not  want  to  hide the result of the voting. Only a  government  that  is\r\n\r\ndishonest and wants to rig either the elections or the referendum\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwould  like to hide the result of the referendum from the public gaze. In  fact,\r\n\r\nit  is  the duty of the Government to inform the people of the exact details  of\r\n\r\nthe  voting.  And the people have a right to know. But in the Bill the  detailed\r\n\r\nresults  will  not  be  made known to the people. Even in the  Local  Government\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  and in the General Elections Ordinance, there is a form which  gives\r\n\r\nthe detailed result of the poll.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I refer you, Sir, to the Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance, section 49, subsection (2), at the last sentence:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Returning Officer shall forthwith after the result has been declared by\r\n\r\nhim  compile  a statement of the poll in the Form 17 'In the First  Schedule  to\r\n\r\nthis  Ordinance and shall cause the name or names of the members so elected  and\r\n\r\nalso the said statement to be published in the Gazette.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And in Form 17, Sir, you have the number of the ballot papers issued; the number\r\n\r\nof  the ballot papers cast for whatever candidate it is, and the number  of  rejected ballot papers. And it all adds up on both sides. Similarly, in the  amendment  which I have moved, I seek, Sir, to have the following. I am now referring\r\n\r\nto the Schedule, Sir:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n 'Number of ballot papers issued\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n  Number of ballot papers cast in respect of\r\n\r\n         do.         do.       do.\r\n\r\n         do.         do.       do.\r\n\r\n  Number of unmarked ballot papers cast\r\n\r\n  Number of uncertain ballot papers cast\r\n\r\n  Number of tendered ballot papers'\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment which I seek shows up the utter dishonesty of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  in the referendum. It is a plot to hide from the eyes of the  people\r\n\r\nthe actual result of the voting in the referendum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us trace the arguments and see how the P.A.P. Ministers argued in the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee. I refer you to column 388 of the Official Report of the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Singapore National Referendum Bill, No. 6, Sir, dated 16th May,\r\n\r\n1962. The Minister for Home Affairs said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, we cannot accept the amendment and the Schedule proposed\r\n\r\nby  the  Member for Queenstown, because the result, according to  the  proposed\r\n\r\nSchedule,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column : 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwould  be  declared  division by division; whereas, as  I  think  I  have  said\r\n\r\nearlier  in  this  Select  Committee, the result of  the  referendum  would  he\r\n\r\ndeclared for Singapore as a whole.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And he followed up. It is a very interesting bit, Sir, and I think it deserves -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Honourable\r\n\r\nmention!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - to be recorded in the Hansard.

They cannot be blank papers. As I say, if we look at the New\r\n\r\nClause  (A),  you  will  find  that unmarked and  uncertain  ballot  papers  are\r\n\r\nprovided, but not blank papers.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>He  was trying to make out that unmarked papers are not blank papers. These  are\r\n\r\nexcuses. We will read through and see:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Then spoilt ballot papers too, I think, should not be lumped together with\r\n\r\nuncertain ballot papers.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>You  will remember, Sir, that when I first moved the amendment, the wording  was\r\n\r\nnot  very accurate and, of course, he had his legitimate objections. He  further\r\n\r\nraised objections:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'They are two different things. No mention again in the Schedule, for\r\n\r\ninstance,  is  made  of rejected ballot papers which are different  from  spoilt\r\n\r\nballot papers.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>I  have  now  in the amendment, unmarked paper, rejected ballot paper - everything\r\n\r\nthat he asked for.
