But I am  not  sure  whether\r\n\r\nthis will do any good to the trade union movement in the\r\n\r\nlong run. For one thing, there is no guarantee that  the\r\n\r\npowers  so given will not be abused. If the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  only consists of persons like the  Member  for\r\n\r\nBras  Basah  and  the Member for Telok Blangah  who  are\r\n\r\nreasonable and intelligent people, then there need be no\r\n\r\nworry.

What we are asking under section 77 is that the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  be  simplified as we have  come  across  many\r\n\r\ncases  of  victimisation  and  we  have  found  it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to bring the employers to book. What makes the\r\n\r\nprocedure  cumbersome is this, Sir. Undue  emphasis  has\r\n\r\nbeen  placed  on the reference to the Public  Prosecutor\r\n\r\nfor  his  opinion on whether the prosecution  is  to  be\r\n\r\ninstituted or not. The whole point is that we  want  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance to be simplified. We do not want to be so very\r\n\r\nunreasonable as to prosecute employers as soon  as  they\r\n\r\ndismiss the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> I have not come to that story yet.\r\n\r\nI will give it later. I am inclined to believe that most\r\n\r\nof the unions affiliated to the N.T.U.C. are reasonable.\r\n\r\nThey  are  led by responsible leaders and they will  not\r\n\r\nabuse  the power. But I am not so sure about the  unions\r\n\r\nwhich  are  not  affiliated to the N.T.U.C.,  especially\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are  assisted by Lenin-styled lawyers.  Once\r\n\r\nthis power is given, I am quite sure they will abuse  it\r\n\r\nto  the full and bring our economic system to a grinding\r\n\r\nhalt.  In  fact, they are already doing  this  now  even\r\n\r\nwithout the help of this power. What will happen if this\r\n\r\npower is given to them will be unimaginable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another point. A man who has invested\r\n\r\nhis  money  in  a  shop or a firm or a factory  and  has\r\n\r\nbecome  an employer would like to be given some  freedom\r\n\r\nof  what  is  called \"Hire and fire\". If every  time  he\r\n\r\ndismisses a worker, whether on genuine grounds  or  not,\r\n\r\nhe is to be hauled up in court to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanswer  charges of victimisation, life would  be  indeed\r\n\r\nquite  miserable for him. In fact, the N.T.U.C. at  one\r\n\r\ntime  earlier  had wanted to lay down in  the  Ordinance\r\n\r\nthat the employer has to go to gaol once he is convicted\r\n\r\nunder section 77. What would the employer think of  this\r\n\r\nif  every  time he sacks a man he has to go to gaol  for\r\n\r\nit? How would he maintain discipline in his factory? If,\r\n\r\nin  these circumstances, a man still wants to invest his\r\n\r\nmoney here and open up factories to benefit our workers,\r\n\r\nthen  I  think  he  must have his head examined  at  the\r\n\r\nWoodbridge Hospital. So it is no wonder that  when  this\r\n\r\nproposal  of  the N.T.U.C. was put up to the  Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation, there was an uproar from the employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are in a very delicate position.\r\n\r\nWe  are  a  pro-labour Government and we  want  to  make\r\n\r\neverything easy for the workers. But, on the other hand,\r\n\r\nwe  must also protect the interests of the employers  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  are not unduly persecuted and do  not  start\r\n\r\nrunning away. On the one side, there is this demand from\r\n\r\nthe N.T.U.C., and on the other, there is this resistance\r\n\r\nfrom  the employers. We must strike a balance somewhere,\r\n\r\nand  I  say the compromise is in clause 22 of the  Bill.\r\n\r\nThere  were extensive discussions among Mr Devan  Nair,\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General,  officials  in  my  Ministry  and\r\n\r\nmyself   before  we  finally  put  in  this   amendment.\r\n\r\nHitherto,  a  complaint of victimisation is reported  to\r\n\r\nthe  police and they will investigate it from the police\r\n\r\npoint  of  view. They seldom secure enough  evidence  to\r\n\r\ninitiate  proceedings. But after this amendment,  it  is\r\n\r\nprovided  that  a  complaint of this  nature  should  be\r\n\r\nreferred  to the Commissioner for Labour. He  will  then\r\n\r\ninvestigate the case from the industrial angle. If he is\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  there is evidence of victimisation,  he\r\n\r\nwill inform the Public Prosecutor and proceedings can be\r\n\r\ninitiated. In this way, we are able to sieve through all\r\n\r\nthe  cases  before they go to the court. Otherwise,  our\r\n\r\ncourts will be jammed up with all kinds of complaints of\r\n\r\nvictimisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exact copy of this Bill was forwarded to the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. on 14th September, 1965. For nearly four months\r\n\r\nit  was lying in the office of the N.T.U.C. and we  have\r\n\r\nnot heard from them that there is something wrong in the\r\n\r\nBill.  Based on this copy which we had forwarded to  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C.,  the  then Secretary-General of the  N.T.U.C.,\r\n\r\nMr  Devan  Nair, has this to say in his report  to  the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. Second Annual Conference in October this  year,\r\n\r\nand I quote, in page 18 --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> From the same paper?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Yes, in the same report. In page\r\n\r\n18, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A close study of the Bill will show that the\r\n\r\nN.T.U.C. can feel justifiable pride at having  secured\r\n\r\nprogressive  amendments  to  the  Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nOrdinance  in  the interest of industrial  justice  and\r\n\r\nfair play.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the personal opinion of Mr Devan Nair, for\r\n\r\nthis  report  was unanimously adopted by  the  N.T  U.C.\r\n\r\nConference in front of trade union leaders from the \r\n\r\nAfro-Asian countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the remarks made by the Member for Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  when  he raised a query on whether  the  proposed\r\n\r\nsection  15A  would  restrict the  Minister's  right  to\r\n\r\nintervene in any dispute between an employer and a trade\r\n\r\nunion  which has lost out on a secret ballot.  The  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  need  not  have  any fear  on  this  score.  The\r\n\r\nproposed  amendments  do not in  any  way  restrict  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  power, and I can assure the  Member  that  I\r\n\r\nstill  have  the  power to direct any trade  dispute  to\r\n\r\narbitration  by the Industrial Arbitration  Court  under\r\n\r\nsection 28 (b) of the Industrial Relations Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the Member for Telok Blangah's complaint\r\n\r\nthat  the 14 days' limit for making an appeal against  a\r\n\r\nreferee's  decision, as provided for in  sub-clause  (6)\r\n\r\nof  clause  18, it is apparent that he is not conversant\r\n\r\nwith  the procedure of the Industrial Arbitration  Court\r\n\r\nin  this matter. I would like to enlighten him that  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  practice  of the Court is to  insist  that  all\r\n\r\nreferee's decisions should be handed down in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwriting  either  by  the  referee  himself  or  to   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar at the direction of the Court. A copy  of  the\r\n\r\nwritten  decision  of  the referee is  immediately  made\r\n\r\navailable to the parties concerned. The regulations that\r\n\r\nwill  be  prescribed  for  appeal  will  lay  down   the\r\n\r\nprocedure  for  appeal step by step beginning  with  the\r\n\r\nnotice  of  appeal. Once the notice of appeal  has  been\r\n\r\nfiled within 14 days under sub-clause (6) of clause  18,\r\n\r\nthe  court  will  proceed  to make  available  the  full\r\n\r\ntranscript of the referee's proceedings together with  a\r\n\r\ncopy of the referee's decision and all relevant exhibits\r\n\r\nto  enable  the  appellant to prepare  his  petition  of\r\n\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the Court has not laid down any time limit for\r\n\r\nthe  appellant  to submit his petition  of  appeal,  but\r\n\r\neventually this will be regulated. I, therefore, fail to\r\n\r\nsee  the  necessity for the amendment  proposed  by  the\r\n\r\nMember.  In view of this, I see no necessity for  either\r\n\r\nan  employer or a union to employ stenographers  at  its\r\n\r\nown  expense to take down court proceedings for its  own\r\n\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Jek Yeun Thong]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

The Administration of Estates Act,  1925,\r\n\r\nof  the  United  Kingdom, which  is  not  applicable  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  vests  the real and personal  estate  of  an\r\n\r\nintestate until administration is granted in the Probate\r\n\r\nJudge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore it is assumed that the estate of an\r\n\r\nintestate  vests  in all the Judges of  the  High  Court\r\n\r\npending  the  grant  of administration.  Clause  5  will\r\n\r\nclarify the legal position by vesting the estate  of  an\r\n\r\nintestate in the Chief Justice between the death of  the\r\n\r\nintestate and the grant of letters of administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 proposes to add to section 54 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance  a proviso to make it clear that the  Official\r\n\r\nAssignee  can,  in urgent cases, apply  for  letters  of\r\n\r\nadministration  within six months of the  death  of  the\r\n\r\ndeceased. At present it would appear that he has to wait\r\n\r\nfor  six months to elapse from the death of the deceased\r\n\r\nperson  before  applying  for  probate  or  letters   of\r\n\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 9 and 10 propose to introduce detailed\r\n\r\nprovisions  for the administration of the  assets  of  a\r\n\r\ndeceased  person  whether  the  estate  is  solvent   or\r\n\r\ninsolvent  at the death of the deceased, and to  provide\r\n\r\nfor  the manner in which charges on the property of  the\r\n\r\ndeceased are to be paid. These provisions are taken from\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom Administration of Estate Act,  1925.\r\n\r\nThey  also  appear  in  the Probate  and  Administration\r\n\r\nOrdinance, 1959, of the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 60 of the Probate and Administration\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  the  Official Assignee  may  administer  the\r\n\r\nestate  of  any  person  who dies  leaving  property  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  not  exceeding $2,000  in  value,  as  though\r\n\r\nletters of administration had been granted to him.

In the first\r\n\r\nplace,    the   Bill   seeks   to   implement    certain\r\n\r\nrecommendations of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Prisons  Inquiry Commission which was appointed  in\r\n\r\nNovember  1959  and,  among  other  things,  recommended\r\n\r\nreform   of   the  existing  legislation  dealing   with\r\n\r\ndestitute persons. Under the Vagrancy Ordinance (Chapter\r\n\r\n125),  no distinction is made between destitute  persons\r\n\r\nand  petty criminals, who are all broadly classified  as\r\n\r\nvagrants  and  may he committed to a house of  detention\r\n\r\nmaintained by the Prisons Department in the precincts of\r\n\r\na  prison  under  the provisions of the  Ordinance.  The\r\n\r\nPrisons  Inquiry Commission recommended  in  its  report\r\n\r\npublished in 1960 that no person should be committed to\r\n\r\na  prison because of destitution, that destitute persons\r\n\r\nshould  be  kept  in  welfare homes run  by  the  Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  Department  as  part  of  the  State's  Welfare\r\n\r\nservices, and that their admission to these homes should\r\n\r\nbe   through  the  Social  Welfare  Department  and  not\r\n\r\nnormally  through a court sentence, as  is  the  present\r\n\r\npractice    under   the   Vagrancy   Ordinance.    These\r\n\r\nrecommendations have been accepted by the Government  in\r\n\r\nthe White Paper on the Commission's Report (Cmd. No.  30\r\n\r\nof   1961),  which  was  presented  to  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly on 27th October, 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill accordingly amends the\r\n\r\nVagrancy  Ordinance by excluding destitute persons  from\r\n\r\nthe  definition of vagrants, so that that Ordinance will\r\n\r\nin  future apply only to petty criminals - as  distinct\r\n\r\nfrom  purely  destitute persons -  who  may,  under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of that Ordinance, be committed  to  varying\r\n\r\nterms of imprisonment. The Bill also deletes Part II  of\r\n\r\nthe  Vagrancy Ordinance relating to the setting up of  a\r\n\r\nhouse  of detention which will no longer be required  on\r\n\r\nthe establishment of welfare homes for destitute persons\r\n\r\nunder   the   provisions  of  this  Bill.   Transitional\r\n\r\nprovisions are also made for persons at present detained\r\n\r\nin  the  house of detention under the provisions of  the\r\n\r\nVagrancy  Ordinance to be admitted  to  a  welfare  home\r\n\r\nafter due inquiry by the Director of Social Welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill will enable the Government to deal\r\n\r\nmore effectively\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith   the   beggars  problem  which  has  lately   been\r\n\r\naggravated  by  the activities of professional  beggars,\r\n\r\nincluding  many from across the Causeway who have  found\r\n\r\nit  extremely profitable to come to Singapore to beg for\r\n\r\nalms.  As  hon.  Members are aware, the  Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment has been engaged for some time in a  campaign\r\n\r\nto  clear  our streets of these beggars, especially  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  beggars, and some  statistics  may  be  of\r\n\r\ninterest  to  the  House. Since  the  beginning  of  the\r\n\r\ncampaign in November last year, the Department has dealt\r\n\r\nwith  some  450 beggars. Of these, some 70  or  so  were\r\n\r\nfound to have come from across the Causeway - some from\r\n\r\nas  far  north  as  Kota  Bahru  and  Alor  Star  -  and\r\n\r\narrangements  were  made  to send  them  back  to  their\r\n\r\ncountry  of origin. Those of Singapore origin, who  were\r\n\r\nfound to be genuinely destitute and without relatives or\r\n\r\nfriends  to  care for them, were given  shelter  in  the\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare Department's homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill gives power to the Department of Social\r\n\r\nWelfare  to deal directly with the beggars problem,  and\r\n\r\nwill  therefore  enable more effective  and  expeditious\r\n\r\naction   to  be  taken.  The  Bill  provides   for   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  welfare  homes  for  the   care   and\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  of destitute persons, and  empowers  the\r\n\r\nDirector of Social Welfare to require destitute  persons\r\n\r\nto  reside in welfare homes after due inquiry. There  is\r\n\r\nalso  provision for any destitute person to be  admitted\r\n\r\nto  a  welfare home on his own application.  Alterations\r\n\r\nhave been made to one of the Department's existing homes\r\n\r\n-  the  Bushey Park Home - to adapt it for the reception\r\n\r\nof  destitute persons. This Home will be the first to be\r\n\r\nset  up  as a welfare home under the provisions  of  the\r\n\r\nBill.  And  as the need arises, other appropriate  homes\r\n\r\nrun by the Department will be similarly adapted and used\r\n\r\nfor the purposes of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, any person who has been admitted to a\r\n\r\nwelfare  home may be discharged to relatives who satisfy\r\n\r\nthe  Superintendent of their ability to support or  care\r\n\r\nfor  the  person to be discharged.

And  one  of  the  most\r\n\r\ncommon,  and  also  the most successful  transplantation\r\n\r\noperations  at  the  present time, is  that  of  corneal\r\n\r\ngrafting, where the corneal graft is obtained  from  the\r\n\r\neye of a recently dead person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, more spectacular transplantations have been\r\n\r\nattempted  although  with less successful  results.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  there  have been transplantations  of  organs,\r\n\r\nlike kidneys, from one person to another, and there  are\r\n\r\nreasonable  hopes that such operations may  become  more\r\n\r\ncommonplace and successful in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been attempts to use tissues from\r\n\r\nanimals  and  even of inert materials such as  plastics,\r\n\r\nfor  replacement and transplantation operations, but the\r\n\r\nmain  source  of transplant material, in the foreseeable\r\n\r\nfuture, will continue to be that of human tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, there is no legislation in existence in\r\n\r\nSingapore whereby a person may \"will\" his body  or  part\r\n\r\nof his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbody  to doctors for use as transplant material. Such  a\r\n\r\ndeficiency  in  our laws has somewhat  hindered  medical\r\n\r\nprogress  in  Singapore for the more  extensive  use  of\r\n\r\ntissue  transplants. As a result, many blind persons  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  for  example, unfortunately have  to  remain\r\n\r\nblind,  because of the lack of sufficient corneas  which\r\n\r\ncan  be  willed for their benefit. This Bill, therefore,\r\n\r\nserves  to bring light and happiness to those now doomed\r\n\r\nto  a  life  of  eternal  darkness  and  unhappiness  by\r\n\r\nenabling persons who are prepared to \"will\" their  eyes,\r\n\r\non their death, for use on suitable persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, advantage has been taken for the Bill to be\r\n\r\ndrafted  for even wider general application and  is  not\r\n\r\nbeing  limited  only to the transplantation  of  corneal\r\n\r\ngrafts.  The  Bill makes it possible  to  use  parts  of\r\n\r\nbodies  of deceased persons for medical treatment,  i.e.\r\n\r\nfor  transplantation of any tissue or organ, as and when\r\n\r\nsuch   operations  can  be  successfully  performed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.

The total cost to Government for  this  \r\n\r\nFive-Year Plan is estimated at $1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action on a national basis is required to cope with\r\n\r\nthe   present   problem  of  uncontrolled  increase   of\r\n\r\npopulation which, if left unchecked, may well hinder and\r\n\r\neven  to nullify present great and strenuous efforts  at\r\n\r\neconomic expansion by the Government and its people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief purpose of this Bill is to provide the legal\r\n\r\nmeans whereby the Five-Year Plan for Family Planning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  be  given effective direction and  execution.  If\r\n\r\nthis  Family Planning programme succeeds -  and  we  are\r\n\r\ndetermined  that it should - besides increasing  welfare\r\n\r\nand  happiness  for  hundreds of thousands,  Singapore's\r\n\r\nfuture  annual net increase in population in the  1970's\r\n\r\ncan be brought down to one-half of its present rate, and\r\n\r\nthus  be  brought in line with the prevailing  rates  of\r\n\r\npopulation  increase  now found in  the  prosperous  and\r\n\r\nadvanced countries of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for the formal constitution of a\r\n\r\nbody  corporate  to  be known as \"the  Singapore  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  and  Population Board\" as recommended  in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper on Family Planning. The Board is to have  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  membership of 15 members, vide  clause  4.  The\r\n\r\nBoard  represents  a broad spectrum of interests,  seven\r\n\r\nare  ex-officio members (five representing the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health  and  the other two from the  Statistics  and\r\n\r\nSocial  Welfare  Departments  respectively)  and   eight\r\n\r\nothers  are  non-officials, two of whom would  represent\r\n\r\nthe  University of Singapore and up to six  others  from\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public who are  deeply  interested  in\r\n\r\nfamily planning and population control activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual powers are given to the Board under clause 6\r\n\r\nto  employ such stall as may be deemed necessary for the\r\n\r\neffective carrying out of its work and programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important provision of the Bill is clause 11 which\r\n\r\nprovides  that  any  person,  body  or  association  now\r\n\r\ncarrying out family planning work in Singapore has to be\r\n\r\nregistered with the Board. Specific exemption,  however,\r\n\r\nis  made for medical practitioners arid pharmacists  who\r\n\r\nare  registered under the Medical Registration Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Cap.  191)  and  Registration of Pharmacists  Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Cap. 198) respectively. The Board may also register any\r\n\r\nbody, association or person carrying out family planning\r\n\r\nwork  with  or without conditions. This is necessary  as\r\n\r\nthe Board is to he the sole agency for the promotion and\r\n\r\ndissemination  of  information  pertaining   to   family\r\n\r\nplanning in Singapore and it must ensure that such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  valuable  social  programme is not  to  be  exploited\r\n\r\ncommercially or otherwise by any other agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent for me to mention, at this stage, of\r\n\r\nthe  prominent  work of two voluntary organisations  now\r\n\r\nconducting  family  planning  activities  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the  Singapore  Family  Planning  Association,\r\n\r\nwhich  was established as far back as 1949, or 16  years\r\n\r\nago,  and at whose request, Government was asked to take\r\n\r\nover  90  per cent of their present responsibilities  on\r\n\r\nfamily  planning.  Arising  out  of  this  move  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Family Planning Association, the White  Paper\r\n\r\non  Family Planning thus came into being. Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nSouth-East  Asia  and  Oceanic Regional  Centre  of  the\r\n\r\nInternational Planned Parenthood Federation and to which\r\n\r\nFederation the Singapore Family Planning Association  is\r\n\r\nalso  a member thereof. This Regional Centre of I.P.P.F.\r\n\r\nserves  as a Training Centre for family planning workers\r\n\r\nfor  the  territories ranging from Fiji in the  east  to\r\n\r\nBurma to the west of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these two voluntary organisations would be\r\n\r\nrequired to register with the Board under the provisions\r\n\r\nof  clause 11 of the Bill, the closest co-operation with\r\n\r\nthese    two    agencies   will   be   maintained,    as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from each of these  two  agencies  have\r\n\r\nbeen sounded to serve as members of the Board under  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  clause 4 (1) (i), and I  am  pleased  to\r\n\r\nstate that these invitations have been accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a provision under clause 12 for the\r\n\r\nMinister,  if  he  deems  it  necessary  in  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest  to do so, to order the Board to take over  the\r\n\r\nfunctions  pertaining to family planning and the  assets\r\n\r\nand  property  of  any  body  or  association  which  is\r\n\r\nrequired either to be registered under the provisions of\r\n\r\nclause 11 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 spells out in detail the functions of the\r\n\r\nBoard   which  covers  family  planning  and  population\r\n\r\ncontrol  programmes, and clause 17 provides for  various\r\n\r\npenalties  for any person who fails to comply  with  the\r\n\r\nvarious  provisions of the Bill. The other  clauses  are\r\n\r\nmainly administrative in character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill.-[Mr Yong Nyuk Lin].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment: read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RESIGNATION OF MEMBER</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FOR BUKIT MERAH</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Mr Lim Huan Boon)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>Announcement by Mr Speaker</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.
