Although  there  was  no  mention  of  this\r\n\r\nmeeting  in the English Press, both the Sin  Chew  Jit\r\n\r\nPoh and the Nanyang Siang Pau issues of 15th December,\r\n\r\n1961,  carried a report of the Press conference  which\r\n\r\nthey   gave   after  the  interview,  and  there   are\r\n\r\nindications that this organisation will persist in its\r\n\r\nagitation  over the recent examination boycott  issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, since the new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool  year  is due to begin a fortnight from  today,\r\n\r\nand  in  the  meantime graduation ceremonies  and  tea\r\n\r\nparties  are  being held in various Chinese  secondary\r\n\r\nschools whilst the proposed Commission of Inquiry into\r\n\r\nthe  examination  boycott has yet to be  appointed,  I\r\n\r\nfeel  it my duty, Sir, to acquaint this House of  what\r\n\r\ntranspired vis-a-vis the interview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, 13th December, I received a registered\r\n\r\nletter  in Chinese from a certain Tan Kong Eng stating\r\n\r\nthat a delegation of seven representatives of the \"All-Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese Secondary Students/Parents Association\" would call on me on 14th of  December  at\r\n\r\n10 a.m. to  discuss - this,  Sir,  is  the   English\r\n\r\nequivalent: I quote - \"matters concerning  the  change\r\n\r\nof system in the Chinese secondary schools with a view\r\n\r\nto  arriving  at an amicable settlement\".  The  letter\r\n\r\nsaid  that as the matter concerned the development  of\r\n\r\nChinese education, the Minister should spare some time\r\n\r\nfor discussion though he might be very busy. After the\r\n\r\ninterview, it was agreed that they would go back to re-discuss\r\n\r\nwhat had transpired at this interview and that\r\n\r\nthey could come back again for another discussion,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary.  I  advised them that, in the meantime,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  desirable to avoid issuing Press statements\r\n\r\nuntil the matter was resolved to mutual satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I see in the 15th December, 1961, issue of\r\n\r\nboth  the  Sin Chew Jit Poh and the Nanyang Siang  Pau\r\n\r\nthat a Press conference was held immediately after the\r\n\r\ninterview, it was reported inter alia - here again, Sir,\r\n\r\nI quote the English equivalent:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We wish to reiterate the nature of our\r\n\r\nrepresentation. We would seriously point out that this\r\n\r\ndelegation  was created by the \"All Singapore  Chinese\r\n\r\nSecondary  Students/Parents Association\" to  maintain\r\n\r\nand  protect  Chinese education,  to  look  after  the\r\n\r\npersonal welfare of our children, to find a reasonable\r\n\r\nsolution  to  the  problem  of  changing  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nsecondary    school    system.    These    are     the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  entrusted  to  us  by   over   2,000\r\n\r\nparents.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>What, in fact, is the true character of this committee\r\n\r\nof  seven, who purport to represent the \"All-Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese Secondary Students/Parents Association\"?  It\r\n\r\nshould be remembered that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeeting of 2,000 so-called parents held in the Chinese\r\n\r\nHigh  School  on  Sunday,  3rd  December,  1961,   was\r\n\r\nconvened by the so-called Action Committee of Students\r\n\r\nwho  boycotted the Government Secondary IV Examination\r\n\r\non  the  issue that it was an \"unreasonable condition\"\r\n\r\nfor  Government to insist that only those who pass the\r\n\r\nGovernment   Secondary  IV  Examination  can   present\r\n\r\nthemselves  for  the  Government  Upper  Secondary  II\r\n\r\nExamination,  which examination will only  take  place\r\n\r\nfor  the  first time at the end of 1963.  This  normal\r\n\r\neducational  practice and procedure has been  accepted\r\n\r\nwithout question by 27 principals of Chinese secondary\r\n\r\nschools  and the Singapore Chinese Schools  Committee-Teacher Association. Of the seven representatives  who\r\n\r\nmet me, four of them claimed that they were not  able\r\n\r\nto  fill  up a form in Chinese which I asked  them  to\r\n\r\ncomplete, and they had to be assisted to do so  by  my\r\n\r\nofficials. They were Mr Lee Swee Seng, Madam Liu Geok\r\n\r\nLan, Madam Yap Kim Lan and Madam Tan Wei Lam. It was a\r\n\r\nsimple  form,  Sir, that I asked them to  fill  up  in\r\n\r\norder  to  check  on  their  credentials  before   the\r\n\r\ninterview got started. Briefly, it asked for the  name\r\n\r\nof the student each represented, his school and class,\r\n\r\nthe relationship of the representative to the student,\r\n\r\nhis  occupation and address, whether he or  she  is  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen and his or her signature. They  were\r\n\r\nat  first reluctant to complete this form and it  took\r\n\r\nme  nearly  15  minutes  to persuade  them  they  must\r\n\r\nestablish  their  credentials.  At  one  stage,   they\r\n\r\ninsisted on calling in the Press. Later on, they  even\r\n\r\nasked for an adjournment to consider this matter,  but\r\n\r\nI  said  it  was unnecessary and that all I wanted  to\r\n\r\nknow was whom they were representing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, of this committee of seven which claims to\r\n\r\nrepresent   \"Parents  of  all  students   of   Chinese\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools\", not a single one is, in  fact,  a\r\n\r\ngenuine parent of a student studying in a Secondary IV\r\n\r\nclass.  One of the representatives, Madam Yap Kim  Lan\r\n\r\nclaimed  to  have a step-daughter in  a  Secondary  IV\r\n\r\nclass in Chung Cheng High School but was unable to say\r\n\r\nwhich of the 15 Secondary IV classes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshe  was in. However, a tedious search was made of the\r\n\r\nschool  registers by my officials, but they failed  to\r\n\r\nfind the student's name that was supplied. Two of them\r\n\r\ndid have some relationship with Secondary IV students,\r\n\r\nnamely,  Tan Kong Eng and Ong Ban Song as brothers  of\r\n\r\nstudents  studying in Secondary IV classes at  Sin  Min\r\n\r\nHigh  School and Chung Cheng High School respectively.\r\n\r\nThe third, Lee Swee Seng, is not even a relative but a\r\n\r\n\"friend\" of a Secondary IV student in Chung Cheng High\r\n\r\nSchool. Of the remaining three representatives who had\r\n\r\nnothing  to do with Secondary IV students, one claimed\r\n\r\nto  have a younger sister studying in Secondary II  at\r\n\r\nYoke  Eng High School, and two others claimed to  have\r\n\r\ndaughters studying in Secondary III at Chung Hwa Girls\r\n\r\nHigh School and Kong Yiong High School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen, therefore, that this committee of\r\n\r\nseven  cannot claim to speak for parents of  Secondary\r\n\r\nIV  students who boycotted the examination - not to  say\r\n\r\nof  all  parents  of  students  in  Chinese  secondary\r\n\r\nschools. They were so told at this interview. Contrast\r\n\r\nthem  with  the genuine parents who accompanied  their\r\n\r\nchildren  to  the  examination  centres  despite   the\r\n\r\npicketing  and  thus proved that the boycott  and  the\r\n\r\npicketing was organised by a minority of agitators who\r\n\r\nmisinformed  the students and others  over  the  issue\r\n\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, Sir, the following interesting additional\r\n\r\ninformation  on  three  of the seven  representatives.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  Tan Kong Eng - the man who wrote the  letter\r\n\r\nseeking the interview - is also known as Tan Kwong Yong.\r\n\r\nHe  is  the  brother and not the parent of  Tan  Kwong\r\n\r\nBuck,  aged 19, a Secondary IV student of Sin Mm  High\r\n\r\nSchool,  who  was  a member of the student  delegation\r\n\r\nwhich met my Parliamentary Secretary on 16th November,\r\n\r\n1961. Secondly, Ong Ban Song was a Communist terrorist\r\n\r\nwho  surrendered to the Johore police  on  8th  March,\r\n\r\n1954, after deserting from the 5th Independent Platoon\r\n\r\nat  Kulai and was released on 31st May, 1954.  He  has\r\n\r\nbeen  Welfare Officer of the Kampong Kembangan  Branch\r\n\r\nof the Singapore Rural Residents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociation and its General Affairs Officer since June\r\n\r\n1961. His younger brother, Ong Ban Kim, aged 17, is in\r\n\r\nSecondary IVA of Chung Cheng High School and  was  one\r\n\r\nof  the picketers. Thirdly, Lee Swee Seng, also  known\r\n\r\nas  Wai  Tau,  is an active supporter of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis.   His  Secondary  IV  student  friend,   who\r\n\r\nboycotted the Government examination, Ng Way Ten  aged\r\n\r\n21,  of  Chung Cheng High School, Secondary IVK class,\r\n\r\nwas  one  of  the spokesmen of the student  delegation\r\n\r\nwhich met my Parliamentary Secretary on 16th November,\r\n\r\n1961  and  an active picket leader at the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation.  It  will  be remembered,  Sir,  that  this\r\n\r\nstudent delegation was responsible for distorting what\r\n\r\nactually  took  place at the same  interview  with  my\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary. And  their  circular  letter\r\n\r\ndated  17th  November, 1961, which was distributed  to\r\n\r\nstudents  and  Members of the public,  first  received\r\n\r\nprominence  in the second issue of Barisan,  organ  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis, on 22nd November, 1961, which  I\r\n\r\nmade mention of in my earlier statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the House may have a true picture of\r\n\r\nwhat  transpired at this interview last Thursday,  and\r\n\r\nto  avoid  misrepresentation, I wish to summarise  the\r\n\r\nposition   as   follows.  These   so-called   parents'\r\n\r\nrepresentatives were told that the Ministry could  not\r\n\r\nagree  to  their request to do away with the so-called\r\n\r\n\"unreasonable condition\" - that only those who pass the\r\n\r\nGovernment   Secondary  IV  examination  can   present\r\n\r\nthemselves  for  the  Government  Upper  Secondary  II\r\n\r\nexamination, which will not be held till  the  end  of\r\n\r\n1963.  It  was  suggested by one representative,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat the \"unreasonable condition\" was not accepted  by\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   Chinese  Schools   Committee-Teacher\r\n\r\nAssociation  hut that it was surreptitiously  inserted\r\n\r\ninto  the Press statement by the Ministry without  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  of the Committee-Teacher Association.  This\r\n\r\nis  not  true.  After a two-hour discussion  over  the\r\n\r\nissues,  agreement  was  reached  and  a  joint  Press\r\n\r\nstatement as published in the Sin Chew Jit Poh and the\r\n\r\nNanyang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSiang Pau on 6th October, 1961, was first read out  by\r\n\r\nmy Parliamentary Secretary in the presence not only of\r\n\r\neight members of the Committee-Teacher Association but\r\n\r\nalso  members of the Press. There is a photo, Sir,  in\r\n\r\nthe   Sin  Chew  Jit  Poh  showing  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  in  the  act of reading  the  agreed  Press\r\n\r\nstatement.

This  could  not  be accepted   as   no\r\n\r\ngovernment in the world would consult immature  school\r\n\r\nchildren  on educational policies. What would  be  the\r\n\r\nsituation if a referendum were asked on whether  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  examinations  at  all?  I  think  it   was\r\n\r\nindicated  by  the  Member for Farrer  Park  that  the\r\n\r\nlikely result would be \"No\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the evidence we had about this so-called\r\n\r\nparents' representatives and the students' boycott, it\r\n\r\nis   now  clear  that  the  whole  operation  of   the\r\n\r\nexamination  boycott  was part  of  the  pro-Communist\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  stir up feelings against the Government.\r\n\r\nAfter  the boy-Cotters had failed in their attempt  to\r\n\r\nwreck  the  Government Secondary IV examination,  they\r\n\r\norganised a four-day \"student congregation\"  from  5th\r\n\r\nDecember to 8th December to have so-called \"collective\r\n\r\nlife\" and \"Hsueh-hsi\", similar to the 1956 period,  at\r\n\r\nthe Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh  School and Chung Cheng High School. During these\r\n\r\nso-called  \"Hsueh-hsi\" sessions, student leaders  read\r\n\r\naloud  the  article on examination  boycott  from  the\r\n\r\nBarisan,  the organ of the Barisan Sosialis. At  these\r\n\r\nsessions student leaders reminded those present of the\r\n\r\nCommunist-inspired  student movement  which  began  on\r\n\r\n13th  May, 1954. One of the girl student leaders asked\r\n\r\nthose  present  not to be afraid of brutal  force  and\r\n\r\ncited  the  May  13  incident as a worthy  example  to\r\n\r\nemulate.  She  urged that they should consolidate  and\r\n\r\nprepare   for  a  more  bitter  struggle  ahead.   She\r\n\r\nstressed,  Sir,  that  in this  Assembly,  instead  of\r\n\r\ndebating  the question of merger, the Government,  she\r\n\r\nalleged   had  brought  in  the  motion   for   police\r\n\r\nprotection   for  parents  of  students   taking   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  examination in order to  divert  the  main\r\n\r\nissue  with  the hope that this bogus merger  proposal\r\n\r\ncould be carried through. Students were also taught to\r\n\r\nsing the following songs, \"The May 13 March\", \"Holding\r\n\r\nHands\",  \"Praised  be  the  month  of  May\",  \"May  13\r\n\r\nRemembrance Song\". For the Current Affairs  test,  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  questions were among those set  for  verbal\r\n\r\nanswer:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(l) Why is it that the education policy of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is similar to that of the  Lim  Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment? Give reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is there any difference between \"citizen\" and\r\n\r\n\"national\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What difference is there between a \"complete\r\n\r\n\"merger\" and \"Malaysia\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Is there any dissimilarity in the education\r\n\r\npolicy  of the Singapore Government and  that  of\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Why do we boycott the examination and what is the\r\n\r\nreaction of the public?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear that student agitators were making\r\n\r\nuse  of innocent students to whip up sentiment against\r\n\r\nmerger,  and  this  boycott was no doubt  part  of  an\r\n\r\noverall  anti-Government  campaign  inspired  by  pro-Communist  elements to subvert the Government  and  to\r\n\r\ncampaign against merger. As we have said from the very\r\n\r\nbeginning,  this  has become not an educational  issue\r\n\r\nbut a political issue engineered by Communists and pro-Communists with the ulterior motive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  discrediting  the  Government.

By   sitting   for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment examination, the majority of students  have\r\n\r\nexposed the true nature of pro-Communist agitation  as\r\n\r\nan  attempt  to  sacrifice students for their  selfish\r\n\r\npolitical  interest.

I remember at one time that a certain\r\n\r\nschool  was offered a piece of that property. I  think\r\n\r\nsome  of  the leases might be expiring at the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year  or  at the end of the next  two  or  three\r\n\r\nyears.   Sir,   this  will  give  the  Government   an\r\n\r\nopportunity to remove some of the very unhealthy areas\r\n\r\nthere and do some clearance work. At the same time, we\r\n\r\nrealise  very well the great difficulty in  resettling\r\n\r\nthe  people  affected. I remember visiting one  family\r\n\r\nliving in a very dingy and poorly ventilated room  and\r\n\r\nthe rent was $20 to $30 per room in that area. I asked\r\n\r\nthem why they did not go for the Housing Board houses,\r\n\r\nwhere  they could get similar accommodation for  about\r\n\r\n$20.  The answer was that they wanted to be near their\r\n\r\nwork.  \"Besides, if we go for the Housing Board houses\r\n\r\nin  Queenstown, it means more transport money, loss of\r\n\r\ntime;  so we would rather pay even $10 per month  more\r\n\r\nthan  go  over  there.\" Sir, these  are  some  of  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties, and we wonder whether the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nmade  plans on the development of the area and how  he\r\n\r\nproposes to resettle these people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> I do\r\n\r\nnot  think we can rebuild the slums of Singapore  just\r\n\r\non the basis of property reverting to the State on the\r\n\r\nexpiry of the ninety-nine year lease. It is only  bits\r\n\r\nof  property  here  and  there and  not  a  continuous\r\n\r\npurchase  of property that will revert to  the  State.\r\n\r\nBut  I think the Member for Tanglin has raised a  very\r\n\r\nvital  issue  which has been exercising the  minds  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  for some time. But we do  not  see  it  as\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we  can do as  part  of  the  present\r\n\r\nDevelopment Plan, because the Housing Board has enough\r\n\r\non its hands to carry out its own housing programme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  will be mainly outside the centre of the  city.\r\n\r\nBut  obviously something must be done about the  slums\r\n\r\nof Singapore. The building are old and dilapidated and\r\n\r\nare  not being maintained. One possible approach which\r\n\r\nthe Government has been thinking about is not only  to\r\n\r\nmake  use  of  the  properties which revert  to  their\r\n\r\nownership at the end of the leases but also to buy  up\r\n\r\nall  properties in areas to be re-developed. But  this\r\n\r\nis  going to be a massive operation. Certainly it will\r\n\r\ncost  several hundred millions of dollars, and it will\r\n\r\nperhaps  take more than a decade to complete. We  have\r\n\r\nasked the United Nations to send a specialist who  can\r\n\r\nadvice  us  on  how  to  proceed with  this  long-term\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the city itself, how we can get rid  of\r\n\r\nthese slum buildings, and how in their places a proper\r\n\r\nand modern city could be built. But as I said, this is\r\n\r\nreally  a rather long-term problem, something  perhaps\r\n\r\nfor  consideration in the second Five-Year Development\r\n\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware that in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  when  these 99-year  leases  expired,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  renewed  them  on  a  similar  basis  with\r\n\r\ncertain  conditions  which the  Minister  calls  in  a\r\n\r\nhaphazard   fashion.  There  are  certain   areas   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  Sir, where a 99-year lease is  granted  in\r\n\r\nrespect of large tracts of land on which a very  great\r\n\r\nnumber  of  houses stand.

Sir, that being so,\r\n\r\nI  would like, first of all, to say that from a  close\r\n\r\nstudy of the Development Estimates which we have  here\r\n\r\nfor 1963 - it would appear that little work has been put\r\n\r\ninto  it.  With  only  one exception,  it  is  a  very\r\n\r\nconvenient   reproduction  of  the  1962   Development\r\n\r\nEstimates,  with  different amounts  estimated  to  be\r\n\r\nspent  in  1963.  Sir, the 1962 Development  Estimates\r\n\r\nhave  at least been prepared with care, giving details\r\n\r\nof   plan   costs,   revised  plan  costs,   estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure  up  to  31st  December,  1961,  estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure in 1962, expenditure required to complete,\r\n\r\nand  notes. The 1963 Development Estimates, Sir,  just\r\n\r\nshow  plan  costs,  revised plan costs  and  estimated\r\n\r\nexpenditure in 1963. These, therefore, do not  give  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  picture.  The  1963  Estimates  have  to  be\r\n\r\nstudied alongside the 1962 Estimates in order to  have\r\n\r\na  clear  understanding of what the  1963  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates are about. Sir, may I touch on this? From  a\r\n\r\nclose study of the two Development Estimates, it would\r\n\r\nappear that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>1963 Development Estimates can be divided  into  five\r\n\r\nclasses.  The first class is that under  the  item,  a\r\n\r\nfull  vote has already been provided for in 1962,  and\r\n\r\nyet for 1963 a token provision of $10 is asked for.  I\r\n\r\nfind  it difficult try understand this. As far  as  my\r\n\r\nlittle  knowledge goes of how budgets  are  drawn  up,\r\n\r\nwhen  one  puts in a token vote of $10, it means  that\r\n\r\nwhile the principle has been accepted, as in the  case\r\n\r\nof  the  hospital at Kandang Kerbau  which  is  to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt,   the  details  have  yet  to  be  studied   or\r\n\r\nfinalised. But in this case of a token vote  in  1963,\r\n\r\nit  is  an extra $10 that is asked for on an item  for\r\n\r\nwhich  full  provision has already  been  provided  in\r\n\r\n1962.   Therefore,  I  say,  Sir,  that   these   1963\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates have been prepared with  little\r\n\r\nor  no  work  at  all. It makes it difficult  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition to understand and appreciate what is behind\r\n\r\nthe   motive  in  presenting  as  a  rush  matter  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates that do not coincide  with  the\r\n\r\nregular  yearly  Development  Estimates,  where   full\r\n\r\ndetails are given. The Government wants a rush job  of\r\n\r\nthis for reasons which they have already explained. We\r\n\r\nhave  accepted those reasons. But they  have  made  it\r\n\r\nmore  difficult for the Opposition to understand  what\r\n\r\nthey  are driving at. That is one of it. One class  is\r\n\r\nwhere  full  estimates have already been  provided  in\r\n\r\n1962,  and  yet for 1963, a token provision  is  asked\r\n\r\nfor. A token provision of $10, as far as we understand\r\n\r\nit,  and as has been explained by the Minister in this\r\n\r\nHouse,  it  always put in where a principle  has  been\r\n\r\naccepted, but the details of the works have  not  been\r\n\r\nfinalised  or  completed. How  could  it  be  a  token\r\n\r\nprovision when the work has already started,  and  the\r\n\r\nfull amount has already been given? That is one class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second class is that full votes have already been\r\n\r\nprovided in 1962, and yet for 1963 some more money  is\r\n\r\nasked  for.  I  think there are over a  hundred  items\r\n\r\nwhere full votes have already been provided in 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just take a case in point, the multi-storey car\r\n\r\npark. Now, for 1962, $2 million has been provided, and\r\n\r\nthe cost of that multi-storey car park is estimated to\r\n\r\ncost  $2 million. Yet for 1963, $1 million is put  in.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  I  can understand, Sir, that  $1  million\r\n\r\ncould  be  a revote, because the Government  does  not\r\n\r\nexpect  that the full amount could have been  paid  or\r\n\r\nthat  the car park could have been completed in  1962.\r\n\r\nBut then in 1962, in cases where it is a revote, it is\r\n\r\nclearly  stated that the vote asked for is  a  revote.\r\n\r\nThat  is in 1962, where actual facts are given, it  is\r\n\r\nrevote.  But  for 1963, just \"Multi-storey  Car  Park,\r\n\r\nPlan  Cost  $2 million, Revised Plan Cost $2  million,\r\n\r\namount  asked for $1 million.\" If we were  to  approve\r\n\r\nthat  $1  million, it could mean that  the  Government\r\n\r\ncould use that extra million to pay for a multi-storey\r\n\r\ncar  park over and above the revised plan cost. Unless\r\n\r\nit  is put in the notes column that it is a revote, we\r\n\r\ncan  have no control. Sir, it seems that the Ministers\r\n\r\ncannot  be  serious about it. They want the Opposition\r\n\r\nto  vote a million dollars for them to put in an extra\r\n\r\nstorey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> I do\r\n\r\nnot want it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, they are now trying to tell a\r\n\r\ncock-and-bull  story about the way they  present  this\r\n\r\nBudget which-they say - what did the Minster for Finance\r\n\r\nsay?  He  explained  in page 37, paragraph  3  [\"First\r\n\r\ncopy\" of the Hansard]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'To settle the details of allocation of votes and\r\n\r\nrevenue   between   State  and   Central   Government.\r\n\r\nadditional work will devolve on Treasury officials and\r\n\r\nthose    Ministries   affected   by    transfers    of\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  and it is not likely  that  the  1963\r\n\r\nBudget will be ready in time. This may well expose the\r\n\r\nGovernment to criticism. There might even be a loss of\r\n\r\nconfidence in the administration. For this reason  and\r\n\r\nin  fairness to the administration, I will   be  asking\r\n\r\nthe  House to approve a vote on account for the  first\r\n\r\nsix  months of 1963. I also intend to ask approval for\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates for the whole of 1963.'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In fairness to the administration\"- May I say to the\r\n\r\nadministration,  in fairness to the  Opposition,  that\r\n\r\nthey must\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent  something that contains full details  and  not\r\n\r\npresent something with no details at all and ask us  to\r\n\r\nvote for it, as I have tried to explain in the case  of\r\n\r\nthis  multi-storey car park. If we were to approve that\r\n\r\nvote  of  $1  million,  although  in  fairness  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  it means a revote, it means we  would  give\r\n\r\nthe  Government the authority to spend $1 million  over\r\n\r\nand  above the $2 million asked for in 1962. Sir,  that\r\n\r\nis the second class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third class is this. In 1962, you will find that\r\n\r\nthe  revised  plan cost is so much; so much  will  have\r\n\r\nbeen  spent by the 31st December, 1961, and a  vote  is\r\n\r\nasked  for in 1962, and there is still some more  money\r\n\r\nrequired to complete. Therefore, that money required to\r\n\r\ncomplete  would, of course, have to be found  in  1963.\r\n\r\nBut then in the 1963 Development Estimates, what is put\r\n\r\nin  to  complete the work is more than what is inserted\r\n\r\nin  the  1962  Budget as required to complete.  Take  a\r\n\r\nsimple   item,  Civil  Aviation.  [Interruption]   That\r\n\r\nhappens  to  be  the first one. Sub-Head  9,  Passenger\r\n\r\nTerminal  Building. According to the 1962 Budget,  what\r\n\r\nis  required  to complete this sub-head is  $1,140,000.\r\n\r\nBut  for 1963, the vote asked for is $2,140,000,  which\r\n\r\nis  $1 million more. And yet there is no explanation at\r\n\r\nall  in  the space provided for notes. Sir, if we  were\r\n\r\njust to consider the 1963 Development Estimates without\r\n\r\nbothering to check every item bit by bit with the  1962\r\n\r\nEstimates,  we  would not know. It would just  disclose\r\n\r\nthat  the  cost of the Passenger Terminal  Building  is\r\n\r\n$4.8  million, the revised plan cost is $3.14  million,\r\n\r\nand  what  is  asked for for 1963 is $2.14 million.  It\r\n\r\ndoes not give the true story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third class is that the vote asked for in 1963 is\r\n\r\nmuch  more than what is required to complete the  work,\r\n\r\naccording to the 1962 Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another class, Sir, and this is really very\r\n\r\nfunny.  For 1962, $10, a lot of $10, that is to say,  a\r\n\r\ntoken  vote  of $10 to say that they want  to  build  a\r\n\r\nhospital,  but the details have not yet been  completed\r\n\r\nor  finalised or worked out. Therefore, a token vote of\r\n\r\n$10.  And  our approving a token vote of $10  for  1962\r\n\r\nwill allow the Government to go ahead with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  scheme and to work out plans for whatever  project\r\n\r\nthe  token vote is for. And for 1963, yet another token\r\n\r\nvote  is asked for. That shows they do not want  to  do\r\n\r\nany work in 1962. If they do not want to do any work in\r\n\r\n1962,  then why ask for a token vote for 1962? Why  not\r\n\r\ncome  to us in 1963? They think it is a playing  matter\r\n\r\nthat  they do not want to do any work for the  good  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore [Laughter]. A laughing  matter\r\n\r\nwhen  they do not care to do that work with which  they\r\n\r\nare  entrusted.  So  you have a  token  vote  in  1962;\r\n\r\nanother token vote in 1963; there may be further  token\r\n\r\nvotes  in  1964  and 1965. I do not think  it  will  go\r\n\r\nbeyond 1963, Sir, because they will be no more by then.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. Government will have been finish ed by then.\r\n\r\nThat is class four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, class 5. This is another funny thing, Sir. They\r\n\r\nhave  in  1962,  if you make a comparison,  work  which\r\n\r\nstarted  in 1960. They paid some money in  1961,  They\r\n\r\nasked  for money in 1962. Then is a balance to complete\r\n\r\nin 1963. And yet in 1963 they put down a token vote. Do\r\n\r\nthey  not know what is required to complete? Must  they\r\n\r\nput  down a token vote of $10? This just goes to prove,\r\n\r\nSir,  that the Ministry of Finance has done no work  on\r\n\r\nthis. If it had done some work, it would have presented\r\n\r\nto this Assembly a picture of the real development that\r\n\r\nis  going on in the country and the development  plans,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  giving us something which is so  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  understand. Sir, if we were just  to  take\r\n\r\nthese  1963 Development Estimates, we would be thinking\r\n\r\nthese are new items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth class I have no quarrel with the Government\r\n\r\nwhen  they put in an amount which is less than the full\r\n\r\namount  to  complete a job. That shows  there  is  some\r\n\r\nwork.  Let  us  take the case where the work  has  been\r\n\r\nstarted in 1961, is to be carried on in 1962, and to be\r\n\r\ncompleted in 1963. An amount is given and then  another\r\n\r\namount is given here where, instead of $1 million,  the\r\n\r\namount  given  is about $800,000. This shows  that  the\r\n\r\nsecretary  in  charge of this has at  least  done  some\r\n\r\nwork,  for he thinks that for 1963, only $800,000 worth\r\n\r\nof  works  will be done. I do not complain about  that.\r\n\r\nBut if it is true that there is work to be done, and if\r\n\r\nreal work had been done,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthere  would  have been a fairer picture presented  to\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly, instead of the Finance Minister coming\r\n\r\nto  us  and saying, in fairness to the administration,\r\n\r\nhe  is  putting  this.  I  say,  in  fairness  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  present, something that does  not  try  to\r\n\r\nhide a lot of work that should have been done but  was\r\n\r\nnot done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the six classes, Sir. Can the Minister\r\n\r\nanswer  them?  In the case of votes that have  already\r\n\r\nbeen  given, why is it that a token vote is now  asked\r\n\r\nfor?  And is my interpretation of a token vote  right?\r\n\r\nThat  is  one.  Why is it that when the full  vote  is\r\n\r\nalready given up to 1962, another amount is asked for?\r\n\r\nIf  it  is meant to be a revote, why not say it  is  a\r\n\r\nrevote?  If  it is not so stated, it could  mean  that\r\n\r\nthat  extra money could be spent by the Government  on\r\n\r\nthe  project.  The third one is, why is it  that  more\r\n\r\nmoney  is  put in to complete the work than  what  has\r\n\r\nbeen stated in the 1962 Development Estimates as money\r\n\r\nrequired to complete the work? The fourth one is,  why\r\n\r\ntwo  token votes, one in 1962 and another in 1963?  Do\r\n\r\nthe Government now say that for the whole of 1962 they\r\n\r\nwill  have no time because they will be in,  I  think,\r\n\r\nthe  fourth round or fifth round of the fight with the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and therefore they will not be  able\r\n\r\nto  do any work? So that they still want a token  vote\r\n\r\nfor 1963. Why two token votes? Does it mean no work in\r\n\r\n1962,  or does it mean that is the convenient  way  of\r\n\r\nputting  $10? The fifth one is, when work has  already\r\n\r\nbeen started and some monies are required to complete.\r\n\r\nwhy  should a token vote of $10 be put in?  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  the Minister for Finance can satisfy us on  all\r\n\r\nthose  points. No matter how he satisfies us, once  we\r\n\r\nhave approved these Development Estimates as stated in\r\n\r\nthis  Cmd. Paper 38, it will give the Government every\r\n\r\nright  to  spend an extra million dollars on a  multi-storey car park or wherever such extra money is  asked\r\n\r\nfor.  I  would therefore urge the Government that,  in\r\n\r\nfairness  to the Opposition, the Minister should  take\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates back and get his Ministry to\r\n\r\ndo  some real work on them, and then come back to  us.\r\n\r\nThere is no rush for 1963; even in July, August\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  even  as  late  as November, he  can  present  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Estimates, as merger in  1963  will  have\r\n\r\nlittle  or no impact on the Development Estimates.  So\r\n\r\nwhy  rush  all  this? I would urge the  Government  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw   these   Estimates  and   re-present   them,\r\n\r\notherwise  it  shall be the duty of the Opposition  to\r\n\r\noppose them through every amendment that I have  under\r\n\r\nmy name - 206 of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon.

Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> While you are in the boxing ring, we are working!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Honestly he has spent some time\r\n\r\nand  effort  on this, and I think he has  raised  some\r\n\r\nvery  pertinent points which I will try to explain  to\r\n\r\nthe  House. First, he grumbles about the fact that the 1963  Development Estimates \r\n\r\nare a virtual reproduction\r\n\r\nof  the 1962 Development Estimates. That is so, and  I\r\n\r\ndid  explain in my statement that both in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinary Estimates and the Development  Estimates\r\n\r\nwe intend not to introduce any new items. So, I think,\r\n\r\nthat comes as no surprise to the Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\nNow,  the six classes of items - combination of  items.\r\n\r\nThe first one is where a full amount has been provided\r\n\r\nfor in 1962, a token sum of $10 is also entered in the 1963 Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should best discuss this in terms of\r\n\r\nconcrete examples, so that everyone will know why this\r\n\r\nprocedure is adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take Head D13, subhead 14 - High Capacity Foam\r\n\r\nTender. I do not know what a High Capacity Foam Tender\r\n\r\nis, but  my  colleague the Deputy Prime Minister,  in\r\n\r\nfact, intends to buy one in 1962. So the full cost  of\r\n\r\nthe  High  Capacity Foam Tender has been  entered  for\r\n\r\n1962.  Now it may just be possible that the Department\r\n\r\nof  Civil  Aviation might place the  order  and  there\r\n\r\nmight be some delay in delivery and, in fact, the bill\r\n\r\nmight  not be presented for payment in 1962, in  which\r\n\r\ncase payment must be made in 1963. The only reason for\r\n\r\nputting   a   $10  vote  in  1963  is  to  meet   such\r\n\r\neventualities. They are not expected to happen but, on\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, we cannot be sure. If in the unlikely\r\n\r\nevent the bill for the High Capacity Foam Tender  does\r\n\r\nnot  arrived in time in 1962, then in 1963,  we  shall\r\n\r\nhave to make use of this vote to pay for it - of course,\r\n\r\nthrough some transfers from other subheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat disposes of the hon. Member's first point on  the\r\n\r\nitems in the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the second one cited was an instance where the\r\n\r\nfull  amount  has been provided in the 1962  Estimates\r\n\r\nand   yet  a  substantial  sum  appears  in  the  1963\r\n\r\nEstimates.  The  multi-storey  car  park  is  a   good\r\n\r\nexample.  Of  course,  the explanation  given  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill is correct. It is, in  fact,  a\r\n\r\nrevote.  The hon. Member asks, \"Why not say a revote?\"\r\n\r\nThe  reason is that before any item is entered in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates as a revote, certain procedures will have to\r\n\r\nbe  complied with; that is, a progress report will  he\r\n\r\nmade to the Treasury - explanation for delay of payments\r\n\r\nand  so  on -  and then it is approved as a revote  and\r\n\r\nentered  accordingly. But I think it is obviously  too\r\n\r\nearly  to enter this item formally as a revote because\r\n\r\na  start has not been made on the project at all. Nor,\r\n\r\non  the  other hand, can we just enter a token sum  of\r\n\r\n$10  because,  in this particular Head, there  is  not\r\n\r\nenough money under other subheads to effect a virement\r\n\r\nof  transfer  of funds. If you look at Head  D19,  you\r\n\r\nwill  see  that  there  are only  two  subheads;  one,\r\n\r\nConstruction and Installation of Parking Places, a sum\r\n\r\nof  $120,000 has been asked for 1963. And  should  the\r\n\r\nMulti-storey Car Park be not completed in  1962,  then\r\n\r\nthere is absolutely no money to pay for the completion\r\n\r\nof  this  project.  Therefore,  we  put  in  a  fairly\r\n\r\nsubstantial sum to meet this eventuality. Of course, I\r\n\r\nhave  had  a  word with the Deputy Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nurged  him  to  get on with this project  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible.  I  understood from him that he has  already\r\n\r\ngot cracking on it. That explains the second class  of\r\n\r\nitems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the third one refers to instances where a vote is\r\n\r\nprovided in 1962 - let us get this right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> More than what is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, the case of subhead 9 of Head\r\n\r\nD13,  Passenger  Terminal Building. The  revised  plan\r\n\r\ncost   is   $3,140,000;  $2  million   is   voted   for\r\n\r\n1962 - leaving therefore $1,140,000 as a balance - whereas\r\n\r\nthe amount asked for in 1963 is just $1 million more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere  again,  the  sum of $2,140,000 consists  of  two\r\n\r\nparts: one is the balance and the other is, in fact, a\r\n\r\nrevote item just in the event that the progress on the\r\n\r\nPassenger  Terminal Building is not  as  fast  as  one\r\n\r\nwould hope it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come to the fourth class of items. He refers\r\n\r\nto  the two $10 token votes for the consecutive  years\r\n\r\n1962  and  1963. He refers to items in the plan  where\r\n\r\neither  there is an order of priority for  getting  it\r\n\r\noff the mark where we can wait for some time and there\r\n\r\nis  no urgency about the matter, or else it means that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry concerned are having second thoughts  on\r\n\r\nthat  project and they have not finally made up  their\r\n\r\nminds whether they want to include it or throw it  out\r\n\r\nor  substitute  some other project. So  for  the  time\r\n\r\nbeing  in  case they revert back to the original  plan\r\n\r\nand  if they want to proceed with it in 1963, they can\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth class is where work has started in 1961,\r\n\r\nsums have been spent in 1962, and a token sum of $10\r\n\r\nis entered in 1963. This is really the same as the\r\n\r\nfirst instance where we have provided a full total for\r\n\r\n1962 but just in case the expenditure is not\r\n\r\ncompleted, where the work is not completed -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Can I explain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What I have said is that the work\r\n\r\nhas  been started in 1961, is carried on in 1962,  and\r\n\r\nthere  is a balance required to complete; and yet  for\r\n\r\n1963,  instead of working out the actual  amount  that\r\n\r\nwould  be  required to be spent in 1963, a  convenient\r\n\r\nway  has been adopted by just putting in a token  vote\r\n\r\nof  $10;  whereas in other cases where some  work  has\r\n\r\nbeen done some amounts have been inserted.

I  think it was for  the  preliminary\r\n\r\ninvestigations, soil-testing and so on, and then later\r\n\r\non  the  Ministry  decided not to  proceed  with  this\r\n\r\nproject.

There will be  no  control.\r\n\r\nTake the Multi-storey Car Park. The revised cost is $2\r\n\r\nmillion and the plan cost is $2 million. They ask  for\r\n\r\n$2 million for 1962 - it is all right. Then they ask for\r\n\r\nan  extra $1 million for 1963 to the extent that it is\r\n\r\nmeant to be a revote. If it were clearly stated  as  a\r\n\r\nrevote  in  the Estimates, I would have no  objection.\r\n\r\nBut  to  vote that $1 million is equivalent to  giving\r\n\r\nthe  Government the right to spend an extra $1 million\r\n\r\nso  that, as they have said, if they want to put up  a\r\n\r\nstorey, they can do so with this $1 million if  it  is\r\n\r\napproved by us. They could put up another two storeys.\r\n\r\nIf  they  suddenly think they might  want  to  have  a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. house  on top, they can still put  it  up.

I  still  maintain  that  these\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates have not been properly  prepared\r\n\r\nand  they do not present a correct picture.

And  the\r\n\r\nMinister says that no new item has been inserted.  May\r\n\r\nI  point out to him that a new item has been inserted,\r\n\r\nand no mention has been made by the Minister?

All  these things simply show that he  is  not\r\n\r\nmaking statements which are helpful to us in making  a\r\n\r\nstudy, in an attempt to help him over his troubles and\r\n\r\nall that. He makes it more difficult. Therefore, if it\r\n\r\ngives  him pleasure to give trouble to the Opposition,\r\n\r\nI  will  say that it is the duty of the Opposition  to\r\n\r\nreturn that pleasure with interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nfor  one  am indebted to the Member for Cairnhill  for\r\n\r\ndrawing  the  attention of the House  to  these  grave\r\n\r\ninadequacies in the Development Estimates for 1963.  I\r\n\r\nam  particularly perturbed, Mr Speaker, at the second\r\n\r\nand  third classes to which he has drawn the attention\r\n\r\nof the House. That is, as in the case of the car park,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  full vote having been made for $2 million for 1962,\r\n\r\nwe have another $1 million for a car park in 1963. And\r\n\r\nin  so far as I can judge, there is nothing to prevent\r\n\r\nthe  Government from having a car park for  a  million\r\n\r\ndollars  in 1963 in respect of which there is no  real\r\n\r\nauthorisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third class, Sir, is where more money has been\r\n\r\nvoted  during  the years 1962 and 1963 in  respect  of\r\n\r\nitems  such  as  the Passenger Terminal Building,  the\r\n\r\ncost  as indicated. This means, Sir, that within  that\r\n\r\nparticular Head, Government would be free, by  way  of\r\n\r\nvirement, to utilise these additional monies for other\r\n\r\nitems where they wish to expand the original scheme. I\r\n\r\nsay, Mr Speaker, that the Opposition, and I trust the\r\n\r\nwhole  House, is indebted to the Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nfor    drawing    attention   to   the    Government's\r\n\r\nextraordinary  fashion  in  presenting  a  budget  and\r\n\r\nseeking a free hand in respect of public monies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final matter, Sir, which is rather a matter of\r\n\r\nprocedure  which  has  not the same  gravity  as  this\r\n\r\nextraordinary confession on the part of the  Minister - that  he  has for 1962 a $10 token vote is respect  of\r\n\r\nmatters  on  which the Ministry has not  made  up  its\r\n\r\nmind.  That is why he seeks another $10 for 1963.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, is it appropriate that the Government  should\r\n\r\ntrouble this House to make up its mind on principle in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  matters  in  connection  with  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment itself has not made up its mind?  What  are\r\n\r\nwe  playing?  Marbles in this House? It is  even  more\r\n\r\nsurprising,  Mr  Speaker,  that  we  have   had   the\r\n\r\nconfession  made  by the Minister in respect  of  Head\r\n\r\nD25,  item 5: that $12,000 is expected to be spent  in\r\n\r\nthe year 1962 in respect of works when, in so far as I\r\n\r\ncan  understand  him, it is intended  to  abandon  the\r\n\r\nSecond District Hospital. How is it that the money has\r\n\r\nalready  been allocated or allocation has been  sought\r\n\r\nin  respect of payment for something which they do not\r\n\r\nwish  to use?

He\r\n\r\nmentioned just now, Sir, that if the planner for  this\r\n\r\ncar park were to start work by, say, April, and decide\r\n\r\nto  build  a  car  park that is  worth  more  than  $2\r\n\r\nmillion, he would obviously be ultra vires. I  submit,\r\n\r\nSir,  the planner who plans a $3 million car  park  in\r\n\r\nApril  1962 is not ultra vires because, in so  far  as\r\n\r\nthis  House  is  concerned,  if  the  two  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates  had  been passed, we would have  authorised\r\n\r\nthe expenditure of $2 million in 1962 and a further $1\r\n\r\nmillion in 1963, making an estimated total expenditure\r\n\r\nof  $3  million  for the years in 1962  and  1963.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt, Sir, the plan costs and the revised plan  costs\r\n\r\nonly  permit the planner an expenditure of $2 million.\r\n\r\nBut  this House which has sat, considered, debated and\r\n\r\npassed  the Budget, allows the planner expenditure  to\r\n\r\nthe  extent of $3 million. I will, therefore, say here\r\n\r\nthat it is a matter of grave doubt whether the planner\r\n\r\nshould allow himself to be guided by the plan costs or\r\n\r\nby that exact amount of monies voted by this House.  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  the  Minister, in the same  tone  as  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Cairnhill has urged him,  to  bring  this\r\n\r\nDevelopment  budget hack and revise it; put  notes  if\r\n\r\nnecessary  to explain that this $1 million would  only\r\n\r\nbe spent should the $2 million be under spent in 1962.\r\n\r\nAnd  whatever  vote  that has been  underspent  should\r\n\r\nlapse in 1962, thereby making it necessary for this $1\r\n\r\nmillion to be spent in 1963. In view of the absence of\r\n\r\nany  explanatory notes, it would appear, Sir, that  if\r\n\r\nthe  two  Development budgets have  been  passed,  any\r\n\r\nplanner who has any respect for the decisions of this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse  would be within his right and within his  power\r\n\r\nto plan a car park which is worth $3 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, over and above the difficulties of\r\n\r\nthe Member for Cairnhill as experienced, I myself have\r\n\r\nexperienced another difficulty which I wish  to  bring\r\n\r\nto  the  notice of the Finance Minister. In  his  1962\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates, Mr Speaker, Sir, if  you  will\r\n\r\nbe  good enough to look at page 7 of Paper Cmd. 36  of\r\n\r\n1961  being  Development Estimates  of  the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore for the Year 1962, and previous to that page\r\n\r\n\"Development  Fund Account\", there is a  statement  of\r\n\r\nEstimated Receipts and Payments. Mr Speaker, you will\r\n\r\nnotice that the Balance as at 31st December, 1961,  is\r\n\r\n$131  million. Then there are a number of items  which\r\n\r\nset  out  the monies which are going to be  paid  into\r\n\r\nthat   Fund.  On  the  right-hand  side  is  Estimated\r\n\r\nPayments  cut  of that Fund for the year  1962,  after\r\n\r\nwhich  the  total  sum  on  the  Receipts  column   is\r\n\r\nexhausted.  So that on the basis of total  expenditure\r\n\r\non  the  Development Fund for the year 1962, the  Fund\r\n\r\nwill  remain nil as at 31st December, 1962.  If  I  am\r\n\r\ncorrect  in  that, then on the 1st January,  1963,  we\r\n\r\nstart with nothing in the kitty except for $80 million\r\n\r\nwhich  was transferred by the Assembly - I think it  was\r\n\r\nlast  week -  from  the  Consolidated  Fund  into   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund, together with the $30 million  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  transferred by the Ministry of Finance  from\r\n\r\nthe  Consolidated  Fund for the  year  1962  into  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund. There will then be $80 million  plus\r\n\r\n$30 million, i.e. $110 millions. So that. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, we start off then on 1st January, 1963, with $110\r\n\r\nmillion,  and the Minister for Finance is asking  this\r\n\r\nHouse  to approve Development Fund expenditure  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  extent  of $173 million. In other  words,  he  is\r\n\r\nasking  this House to approve expenditure payable  out\r\n\r\nof the Fund, the capital of which is not sufficient to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  expenditure he is asking us  to  meet.  The\r\n\r\ncurious thing about these 1963 Estimates, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, is that the Statement of Estimated Receipts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Payments  which appears in the  1962  Development\r\n\r\nEstimates does not appear. It is conspicuously absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to ask and which is causing\r\n\r\nsome  confusion amongst the Opposition Members is this\r\n\r\ncar  park. Will the Minister assure the House that the\r\n\r\ngoverning factor for the expenditure of monies will be\r\n\r\nthe total revised cost?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, in view of the guillotine, may\r\n\r\nI say this to the Minister?

So how can they be so sure about anything?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> May I explain this? When I was\r\n\r\nbending  my mind to the problem of how to present  the 1963   Estimates  \r\n\r\nto   the  Assembly,   I   had   two\r\n\r\nalternatives. One is to present them in a simple  way,\r\n\r\nwith  three  columns, which is fairly straightforward.\r\n\r\nThe  other  one  would be to take  into  account  what\r\n\r\nhappened  in  the  plan cost, the revised  plan  cost,\r\n\r\nexpenditure  in  1961  and 1962, amounts  required  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  amount estimated in 1963; whether there  are\r\n\r\nrevotes or no, and so on and so forth. That would make\r\n\r\nthe  matter of presentation rather complicated. If the\r\n\r\nMembers opposite so desire, it is a simple matter  for\r\n\r\nme  to  do. I am quite willing to reproduce  the  1963\r\n\r\nEstimates  absolutely on the same  basis,  because  we\r\n\r\nhave  all the working papers in our own files.  It  is\r\n\r\nonly to save Members of the Opposition from trying  to\r\n\r\nread  columns  that  we have presented  three  columns\r\n\r\nonly. If they want eight columns, so be it. I am quite\r\n\r\nhappy to present to the Assembly the same stuff by the\r\n\r\nsame  identical  method. It is not a  question,  as  I\r\n\r\nsaid,  of whether we have been working on them or  not\r\n\r\nworking on them. It is a matter of presentation.  They\r\n\r\nwant   a   more  complicated  presentation.  If   that\r\n\r\nsatisfies  them,  I  am  quite happy  to  take  these\r\n\r\nEstimates  back  and come back to the  Assembly  again\r\n\r\nnext month. But I do ask Members of the Opposition  to\r\n\r\nthink carefully about it. Do we want to waste the time\r\n\r\nof the Assembly all over again over a set of estimates\r\n\r\nwhich  would differ only in presentation, only in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  columns  they should have?  The  substance\r\n\r\nwould  be  absolutely  the same.  If  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition want it, I am quite happy with it.  I  have\r\n\r\nno objection at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is there a way\r\n\r\nwhereby the Finance Minister can withdraw?

The\r\n\r\nreason  why they should go to the Estimates  Committee\r\n\r\nto  consider the form in which these Estimates  should\r\n\r\nbe  presented is that no decision has been arrived  at\r\n\r\nby  the House.

Sir, it is comparatively easy to  formulate\r\n\r\npolitical  policies. But political policies which  are\r\n\r\nnot  geared to economic realities become mere  slogans\r\n\r\nand  are doomed to failure. The harsh reality that  we\r\n\r\nmust constantly remember is the rapid increase of  the\r\n\r\npopulation - about  4 per cent per  annum - one  of  the\r\n\r\nhighest  in the world, which is confined to  a  little\r\n\r\nisland of 200 square miles, so that within the next 20\r\n\r\nyears  we  will not only be packed like sardines,  but\r\n\r\nthere  will  be real competition for land between  the\r\n\r\nliving  and  the dead. It is estimated  that  in  1962\r\n\r\nthere  will be a net increase of 14,000 people looking\r\n\r\nfor  employment;  and  by  the  end  of  1964,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  some  84,000  jobs  be  created.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  at  unemployment  is  aggravated  by  another\r\n\r\nthreat.  Traditionally a city that has  lived  on  its\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade,  we now find that this  prop  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic  life is being slowly eaten away  because  of\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries  resorting  to  direct   trade\r\n\r\narrangements and to the improvement of their own  port\r\n\r\nfacilities.  In  order  to  prevent  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem from growing to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunmanageable proportions within the next  five  years,\r\n\r\nit  is, therefore, very necessary that the foundations\r\n\r\nfor  industrialisation should now be made and a  crash\r\n\r\nprogramme carried out. Such a crash programme  has  to\r\n\r\nbe  mainly  in building and construction  and  in  the\r\n\r\nexport  industries.  The importance  of  building  and\r\n\r\nconstruction can be gauged by the estimate that  5,000\r\n\r\npeople  lost  their jobs between 1957  and  1960  when\r\n\r\nthere was a slowing down of building activities.  This\r\n\r\nyear  saw  the  revival  of the construction  industry\r\n\r\ninitiated by the building programme of the Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board and the revival of private  building\r\n\r\nactivity  due  to  the  favourable  change  of  policy\r\n\r\ntowards  the development charges for main City Council\r\n\r\nservices.  The  number  of  houses  expected   to   be\r\n\r\ncompleted  by the Housing and Development  Board  this\r\n\r\nyear  is  7,454;  and next year, the  Board  hopes  to\r\n\r\nachieve its target of 10,000 houses a year. All  this,\r\n\r\nof  course, means, firstly, fulfilling the  dreams  of\r\n\r\nseveral  thousand people who have applied  for  public\r\n\r\nhousing  for  as  long  as six  years.  Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nincrease in building activity means that the estimated\r\n\r\n5,000  building  workers who became unemployed  during\r\n\r\nthe  building slump of 1957 to 1960, have now been re-engaged  in construction and it is possible  that  new\r\n\r\nlabour  has  also entered the building  industry.  The\r\n\r\nincrease  in building and construction also  means  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in demand for building materials, especially\r\n\r\ncement,  sand  and steel. In fact, imports  of  cement\r\n\r\nhave  increased  by  40 per cent for  the  first  nine\r\n\r\nmonths of this year, and the supplying of sand for the\r\n\r\nbuilding  trade has increased to such an  extent  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has recently found  it  necessary  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  Bill to control sand washing activities.\r\n\r\nThe  boom in the building and construction sector  has\r\n\r\ngenerated  considerable activity in many  spheres  and\r\n\r\nought  to  quicken the setting up of the  $50  million\r\n\r\nsteel mill which is to be located in Jurong. Steps  to\r\n\r\nstimulate  the  setting  up of  export  industries  in\r\n\r\nJurong and other industrial estates have already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  explained in detail by the Finance  Minister  in\r\n\r\nhis  Budget  Speech  on the 7th  of  this  month.  The\r\n\r\nIndustrial Development Board has already been  set  up\r\n\r\nand  it  will  be assisted by the Industrial  Research\r\n\r\nUnit which is now being formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ancillaries to this industrial leap forward, it is\r\n\r\nnecessary  that  there must be an adequate  supply  of\r\n\r\nelectric  power  and  water.  A  consultant  firm   of\r\n\r\nengineers  has already been appointed to  study  plans\r\n\r\nfor the construction of a new power station. The first\r\n\r\nstage of the power station will have a capacity of  60\r\n\r\nmegawatts. This plan should be ready by next year when\r\n\r\nwork  commences.  Recently, an  agreement  to  extract\r\n\r\nwater  from  the Scudai River was concluded  with  the\r\n\r\nJohore  Government.  Work  on  the  Scudai  Waterworks\r\n\r\nshould commence next year and the first phase is aimed\r\n\r\nat  producing 15 million gallons per day. The tempo of\r\n\r\nindustrial activity ought to heighten next  year.  The\r\n\r\nindustrial  estates will have to be served  by  roads.\r\n\r\nThis  means that the road-building programme  will  be\r\n\r\naccelerated  and also facilities at the Harbour  Board\r\n\r\nand Airport must be increased. All these plans will be\r\n\r\nset  in motion now that the Development Estimates  for\r\n\r\n1962  have  been passed by the Assembly. Three  berths\r\n\r\nwill  be completed by the Singapore Harbour Board next\r\n\r\nyear, and the extended runway at the Airport should be\r\n\r\nbrought  into  operation by the end  of  January  next\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrialisation is synonymous with the availability\r\n\r\nof technicians and skilled workers. Recently, a survey\r\n\r\nof  technical education was presented to the  Assembly\r\n\r\nand  the  Minister for Education will present a  White\r\n\r\nPaper on the Report sometime next year. Meanwhile, the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  is now training nearly 2,400 students  in\r\n\r\nvarious technical subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All avenues of employment should be explored.\r\n\r\nIndustrialisation cannot take place overnight or,  for\r\n\r\nthat   matter,  within  a  year.  We  have   therefore\r\n\r\ninvestigated  the  possibilities  of  increasing   the\r\n\r\nnumber of Singapore citizens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  employment on board ships. Nearly 100 vessels\r\n\r\nare  cleared each day from our harbour, and as the\r\n\r\nfifth largest port in the world, it is right  that\r\n\r\nmore of our people should look towards the sea for\r\n\r\ntheir  career.  At  some opportune  date  I  will\r\n\r\npresent a report to the Assembly of the steps that\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  take  to  increase   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  for seamen and other categories  on\r\n\r\nboard ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1959 and 1960, when we first took over\r\n\r\nthe  Government, we had to feel our way and  study\r\n\r\nthe  problems that face the administration and the\r\n\r\npeople. Between 1960 and 1961, concrete plans  for\r\n\r\neconomic  development were drawn up. These  plans,\r\n\r\ncalled   the  Four-Year  Development  Plan,   were\r\n\r\npresented to the Assembly in March this year.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  half  of 1961 marks the beginning  of  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the Four-Year Development  Plan.\r\n\r\nNext  year, 1962, should see the Development  Plan\r\n\r\nbeing   carried  out  with  increased  tempo   and\r\n\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,I have tried to present in a very simple\r\n\r\nform  the  general problem that faces us  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry. Since the postwar years of Singapore have\r\n\r\nbeen  very stormy, it is important that we in  the\r\n\r\npolitical forest should not lose our way  by  only\r\n\r\nlooking at the trees, and it is important that  we\r\n\r\nshould also be able to see the picture as a whole.\r\n\r\nWhoever  may  be  in charge of the  administration\r\n\r\nwill  be faced with this vexations problem of  the\r\n\r\nrising  birth-rate  and, at  the  same  time,  the\r\n\r\nproblem of providing jobs for the people.  Here  I\r\n\r\nhave  tried  to  present  very  simply  what   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  proposes to do in 1962 and  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  outlined in the Negara's speech. As  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned   earlier,  we  have   dealt   in   very\r\n\r\nparticular  detail  with that  during  the  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate and in Committee of Supply on the Estimates\r\n\r\nfor 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the speech\r\n\r\nof the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed to:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of\r\n\r\nSingapore, express our thanks to the Yang di\r\n\r\nPertuan Negara for the speech which he delivered\r\n\r\non behalf of the Government at the opening of the\r\n\r\npresent session of this Assembly.\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That the following Address in reply to the\r\n\r\nspeech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed\r\n\r\nto:- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of\r\n\r\nSingapore, express our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which he delivered\r\n\r\non behalf of the Government at the opening of the\r\n\r\npresent session of this Assembly.\".'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Order Paper stands an amendment in the\r\n\r\nname  of the Member for Queenstown*.

On  many\r\n\r\noccasions he has been to Cameron Highlands. He is\r\n\r\ntrying  to get support from the Right-wing people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. On the one hand, he  has  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the reporters here and, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nhe has to write his own stories and make speeches\r\n\r\nover  radio.

I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  because the Prime Minister  has  been\r\n\r\nbusy  with such activities, the problems  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the rural areas have been overlooked.\r\n\r\nSo  the  question of the livelihood of the people\r\n\r\nhas  been  ignored  for the time  being.  In  the\r\n\r\nspeech  delivered by the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,\r\n\r\nthere  is no mention of anything which can  truly\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problems affecting the livelihood  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  and  of improvements  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  In  the policy speech, mention  has  been\r\n\r\nmade  only  in  regard to items  such  as  social\r\n\r\nservices,  which are not very important.  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat social services are only of minor importance\r\n\r\nand that there is no need for any emphasis on it.\r\n\r\nI  feel that this emphasis is only given to cover\r\n\r\nup the opportunistic means of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in the last two\r\n\r\nyears,  although the P.A.P. has  installed  some\r\n\r\nstandpipes  and built some parks  in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  let  me tell them: do not  make  use  of\r\n\r\nthese minor\r\n\r\nimprovements   to   bluff  the   rural   people.\r\n\r\nEverybody  knows that every year the  Government\r\n\r\ntaxes  the  people a great deal,  and  so  these\r\n\r\nsocial services are a\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Government.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nneed   for   any   emphasis  in  this   respect.\r\n\r\nPersonally  I  feel  that  the  installation  of\r\n\r\nstandpipes  and  construction of  roads  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas are not very important, because they\r\n\r\nare part and parcel of the social services which\r\n\r\ndo  not actually go towards improving the  basic\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the people in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since colonial rule, many people in Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  been  in  a very difficult position.  This\r\n\r\ndifficulty   is   well  known  to   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, because in the past the  P.A.P. had\r\n\r\nmany branches in the rural areas and some P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders were in touch with the rural people.  At\r\n\r\nthat time these leaders made some suggestions to\r\n\r\nimprove the livelihood of the people. There were\r\n\r\nalso  some good and valuable ideas put  forward,\r\n\r\nbut up to now the P.A.P. Government has not done\r\n\r\nmuch  to  improve the livelihood  of  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us recollect the\r\n\r\n1959  general elections. At that time the policy\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. was stated in the pamphlet  [The\r\n\r\nTasks Ahead]. The first point mentioned was  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of  the  rural   areas   and   the\r\n\r\nimprovement  of the people therein. This  policy\r\n\r\nwas  welcomed and supported by the people in the\r\n\r\nrural   areas.  The  farmers  thought  that   by\r\n\r\nsupporting the P.A.P. their livelihood would  he\r\n\r\nimproved  and so they voted for the  P.A.P.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P., which depended on their support, finally\r\n\r\nwas  very successful in the elections in all the\r\n\r\nrural areas. But since taking over the reins  of\r\n\r\ngovernment, the leaders of the P.A.P. only  knew\r\n\r\nhow   too  consolidate  their  position  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and their political influence.  They\r\n\r\njust did not care very much for the rural people\r\n\r\nwho they thought are simple-minded and gullible.\r\n\r\nThey thought that if they could\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo  a  bit of social service to the rural people,\r\n\r\nthe people would be satisfied. But as a matter of\r\n\r\nfact,  that  idea is all wrong. The rural  people\r\n\r\nare  generally dissatisfied with the  Government.\r\n\r\nEverybody  says that the P.A.P.'s  The  Tasks\r\n\r\nAhead  proclaimed  during the  general  elections\r\n\r\nwere nothing but a bluff. They cry out wine,  but\r\n\r\nsell  vinegar  instead. The rural people  thought\r\n\r\nthat  since the P.A.P. has been in power for some\r\n\r\ntwo years, it should try to go all out to improve\r\n\r\nthe  lot  of the rural people. But up to now  we,\r\n\r\nhave  not  seen the P.A.P. Government  fulfilling\r\n\r\nits   election  promises.  The  P.A.P. has  made\r\n\r\ncertain  promises to the rural people  but  after\r\n\r\nhaving been in office for half the term, none  of\r\n\r\nthe  election promises has been fulfilled. It  is\r\n\r\nobvious that the P.A.P. Government is not willing\r\n\r\nto go all out to serve the rural people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now quote the\r\n\r\npamphlet  [The Tasks Ahead] issued by the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nin  1959  during the general elections.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  quote some paragraphs to show that  the\r\n\r\npolicy  speeches of the Government for this  year\r\n\r\nor  for  next year are not very helpful in regard\r\n\r\nto  the  promises made to the rural people.  This\r\n\r\nwill also show that the P.A.P. Government is  not\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  or interested in  improving  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the rural people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in this pamphlet\r\n\r\noutlining the policy of the P.A.P., there is  one\r\n\r\nsection  regarding  the  economy  of  the   rural\r\n\r\npeople. The first question on \"Rural Development\"\r\n\r\nconcerns the improvement of the lot of the  rural\r\n\r\npeople.  Now, let me read out several  paragraphs\r\n\r\nwhich  were  then very impressive but  which  now\r\n\r\nshow   that   the   P.A.P.  Government   is   not\r\n\r\nresponsible for what it said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first paragraph, it is stated:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our farmers in the rural areas are already\r\n\r\nproducing  all the poultry, eggs and  pigs  which\r\n\r\nour  population needs and there is a surplus  for\r\n\r\nexport. This they have been able to do with  very\r\n\r\nlittle   support  and  encouragement   from   the\r\n\r\ngovernment.'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  past  and the present governments  have  not\r\n\r\ngiven  very  much encouragement in this  respect.\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy  Speaker, Sir, this  paragraph  shows\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  farmers in Singapore play a great  role  in\r\n\r\nthe  produce  of  Singapore,  but  the  colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment and the Lim Yew Hock Government  gave\r\n\r\nthem  little  encouragement and support.  During\r\n\r\nthe election time these words made the people in\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas very happy. But now the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment has done hardly anything to encourage\r\n\r\nand  to support the produce of the rural people.\r\n\r\nAs  a  matter of fact, the P.A.P. Government  is\r\n\r\ntoeing the line of the Lim Yew Hock Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency most of the dwellers are\r\n\r\nfarmers,  and so I can clearly understand  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood,  and  more so when  I  myself  am  a\r\n\r\nfarmer  there. Some of the farmers are concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the rearing of domestic animals; some  are\r\n\r\nengaged in agricultural activities. We know that\r\n\r\nto  rear  pigs, we need pig sties, and  to  keep\r\n\r\npoultry  we need chicken runs. But it  was  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  get approval for the construction\r\n\r\nof   these   facilities  due  to  the  stringent\r\n\r\nconditions  and  regulations  of  the   previous\r\n\r\nGovernment. As a result, the farmers in the past\r\n\r\nsuffered  great inconvenience. At that  time  we\r\n\r\ncould  not  see  any application from  a  farmer\r\n\r\nbeing approved for the construction of pig sties\r\n\r\nand  chicken  runs.  But now  under  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  these unreasonable and  unfavourable\r\n\r\nregulations still exist. When a farmer wants  to\r\n\r\nput  up  a  chicken run, he has to go through  a\r\n\r\ncertain  procedure  and  a  lot  of  trouble  is\r\n\r\ninvolved, as otherwise he will be fined. Even in\r\n\r\nrepairing  old structures, it is still necessary\r\n\r\nto go through such procedure and trouble, to say\r\n\r\nnothing  about  new structures. Furthermore,  as\r\n\r\nthe  farmers are not aware of the procedure and\r\n\r\nwhere  these  departments are, very  often  they\r\n\r\nhave to waste a lot of time and money going from\r\n\r\none  department to another to get  things  done.\r\n\r\nThey  have gone through a lot of suffering,  and\r\n\r\nso  they  cannot help thinking that the promises\r\n\r\nmade by the Government during election time were\r\n\r\nwild promises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me again quote\r\n\r\nfrom  this pamphlet the last paragraph on  rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment to show that the Government  is  not\r\n\r\nsincere and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis bluffing the people. (Well, the Government\r\n\r\nhas bluffed me at least.)\r\n\r\nThe last paragraph reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A source of considerable irritation to dwellers\r\n\r\nin  the  rural  areas  is the unsatisfactory  and\r\n\r\narchaic  Rural  Board  Building  bye-laws.  These\r\n\r\nimpose undue hardships on rural dwellers in  such\r\n\r\nmatters  as the repair of their homes.  We  shall\r\n\r\nensure  that  these  sources  of  irritation  are\r\n\r\nremoved  and that all rural dwellers  are  freely\r\n\r\ngiven  permission whenever they find it necessary\r\n\r\nto repair their modest\r\n\r\nhomes.'\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.

I  wish  to   draw\r\n\r\nattention to the Standing Order on the quorum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice taken that thirteen Members were not\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members summoned as if for a division pursuant\r\n\r\nto the Standing Order, and meeting resumed upon a\r\n\r\nquorum being then present.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  would  like  to go  on  with  my  speech\r\n\r\nregarding poultry and other domestic animals.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as  I know, during the time of the  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock  Government, there were some  chemicals  for\r\n\r\ndomestic  animals which were easily available  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But  during the term  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, steps have been taken to see that\r\n\r\nthese chemicals for domestic animals cannot be\r\n\r\nobtained without a veterinary\r\n\r\nofficer's  permission. As far as I know,  it  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult for the ordinary farmer to  look\r\n\r\nfor  a  veterinary officer. So when the  animals\r\n\r\nbelonging  to the farmers suffer from  diseases,\r\n\r\nthe  farmers  suffer a great loss,  because  the\r\n\r\nchemicals\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  medicines are not easily available. I want\r\n\r\nto  remind the Government to find a solution to\r\n\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the\r\n\r\nsecond question of the improvement of the rural\r\n\r\npeople.  That  is the reduction of agricultural\r\n\r\ncosts.  In  the  P.A.P.'s  pamphlet,  The  Task\r\n\r\nAhead,  at  page 1 of the Chinese  version,  it\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is our aim to expand and improve on\r\n\r\ngenetics and nutrition research with regard  to\r\n\r\nour animal population, and by well\r\n\r\nplanned extension services, to bring the\r\n\r\nbenefits of this research to our farmers ...'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There is another paragraph which states:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is our aim to give economic aid to the\r\n\r\nfarmers in their production.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  these sentences  are  very\r\n\r\nshort.  But  they  are  of great  significance,\r\n\r\nespecially the second part. If this part of the\r\n\r\nprogramme  is carried out, then the problem  of\r\n\r\nthe  farmers will be solved to a great  extent.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P.  Government  has  made  a  lot   of\r\n\r\npromises but has not carried them out  and  the\r\n\r\npeople know about it. As a matter of fact,  the\r\n\r\nlot  of the farmers is a painful one. They  are\r\n\r\nhoping  that  the  Government will  look  after\r\n\r\ntheir  welfare. During the general election  in\r\n\r\n1959,  the  Government came to  power  with  an\r\n\r\noverwhelming majority with the support  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers. But the last two years have been  very\r\n\r\ndisappointing to the rural people. These people\r\n\r\nhave  made sacrifices, but in return they  have\r\n\r\nnot received any reasonable rewards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quote the cost and the prices of\r\n\r\nagricultural  products. The feeding  stuff  for\r\n\r\nanimals  costs $15 to $17 per picul.  Based  on\r\n\r\nthis,  it will cost the farmers $120 to produce\r\n\r\na  hundred  katties of pork or  fowls.  If  the\r\n\r\nmarket  price is good, the farmers may be  able\r\n\r\nto  make  some profit. But if it is  bad,  then\r\n\r\nthey may lose some money by rearing poultry.  I\r\n\r\nwant  to bring up the question of rearing pigs.\r\n\r\nThe feeding stuff for pigs costs $13 to $15 per\r\n\r\npicul. So you must spend about $85 in order  to\r\n\r\nproduce $85 worth of meat. If a pig costs about\r\n\r\n$70 per picul then the pig-rearers will sell at\r\n\r\na  loss. This is the same with eggs. At present\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of chicken feed is so high  that  it\r\n\r\nwill cost\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout eight cents to produce one egg. The selling\r\n\r\nprice  is only about nine to ten cents. When  the\r\n\r\nprice is low, it comes to about seven and a  half\r\n\r\ncents. Mr Speaker, Sir, you will see, therefore,\r\n\r\nfrom  their  costs and their selling prices  that\r\n\r\nthe  people  in  the  rural areas  are  suffering\r\n\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I want to touch upon the third\r\n\r\nquestion - rural development; that is the\r\n\r\ncare to be taken of the farmers' land. 'Singapore\r\n\r\nis a very small island with a\r\n\r\ngreat population. The arable land is\r\n\r\nlimited. The farmers are very concerned\r\n\r\nwith their possession of arable land. Although\r\n\r\nthe farmers cannot contribute\r\n\r\na great deal to the food of the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, they do play a great part in  the\r\n\r\nsupply of vegetables, eggs and other meats. These\r\n\r\nsupplies  all come from the farmers of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  this respect, they play a great part  in  the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  Singapore.  This  question  of   the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  arable land is very  important.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  land  owned  by  the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  usually on  lease.  This  land  is\r\n\r\nusually  under  the control of the  Land  Office.\r\n\r\nSome  land belong to the military forces. We know\r\n\r\nthat, in general, the land does not belong to the\r\n\r\nfarmers themselves. So they cannot freely develop\r\n\r\nit.  Not  only  are, they unable  to  develop  it\r\n\r\nfreely, but they are also usually confronted with\r\n\r\nsome  restrictions. I can quote you one  concrete\r\n\r\nexample  which I have personally come across.  It\r\n\r\nwas  about  half  a year ago.  In  Yio  Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nbetween  the  9\ufffd  and the 11  m.s. there  was  a\r\n\r\nvillage  known  as  Chin  San  Village.  In  this\r\n\r\nvillage  there were originally about 300 families\r\n\r\nof  farmers.  Some  families were  asked  by  the\r\n\r\nmilitary  forces to quit from this  land  because\r\n\r\nthey  wanted  to  set up some  areas  there,  and\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the telecommunications  system  they\r\n\r\ncomplained that the farmers made a lot  of  noise\r\n\r\ndisturbing  the telecommunication  services.  The\r\n\r\nwireless  station is near the main Yio  Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nRoad and there is heavy traffic along it. As  far\r\n\r\nas  I understand, many children attend schools in\r\n\r\nthis area and they are affected by this notice to\r\n\r\nquit. The so-called\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndisturbance   to  the  wireless   service   was\r\n\r\nactually caused by the heavy traffic along  Yio\r\n\r\nChu  Kang  Road, but instead the complaint  was\r\n\r\nmade  against the farmers living in  the  small\r\n\r\nvillage. The military forces just cooked  up  a\r\n\r\nreason  to ask the farmers to quit, as a result\r\n\r\nof  which,  the livelihood of the  farmers  was\r\n\r\naffected.  But the so-called popularly  elected\r\n\r\nGovernment  who were brought to  power  by  the\r\n\r\npoor people simply neglect the people there and\r\n\r\ngive  them  no, protection whatsoever.  So  the\r\n\r\nwireless  station gave notice to the  villagers\r\n\r\nto  quit  and  they were forced to leave  their\r\n\r\nland.  As far as I understand, when the farmers\r\n\r\nwere confronted with this notice to quit, their\r\n\r\nlivelihood was affected to a very great extent.\r\n\r\nThese families who were asked to quit from  the\r\n\r\nvillage  were  paid some sort of  compensation,\r\n\r\nbut  every  family was not given enough  arable\r\n\r\nland  to carry on its production work. It could\r\n\r\nget only one-quarter acre of land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point about their difficulty\r\n\r\nis as follows. The farmers who were\r\n\r\nforced to quit were not compensated\r\n\r\nreasonably well, according to the law.\r\n\r\nAccording to their valuation, it was only\r\n\r\none dollar compensation per square foot\r\n\r\nin respect of cemented floor, and in respect of\r\n\r\nuncemented floor the compensation rate was only\r\n\r\n80 cents per square\r\n\r\nfoot. As regards chicken runs and pig\r\n\r\nsties only 70 cents per square foot was\r\n\r\npaid in respect of cemented floor and 50\r\n\r\ncents  in  respect  of  uncemented  floor;  and\r\n\r\nevery  acre  of  land could not get  more  than\r\n\r\n$1,500  compensation. Let  me  quote  one  more\r\n\r\nexample.  Say  you have a house which  occupies\r\n\r\nabout   900  square  feet.  According  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's rate of compensation, you will get\r\n\r\nabout  $700  to  $900. But we know  that  after\r\n\r\nthese farmers have been forced to quit, it will\r\n\r\ncost  them  far more to put up a similar  house\r\n\r\noccupying a similar area. In fact, you  require\r\n\r\ndouble the amount of compensation to put up the\r\n\r\nsame type of house occupying the same area.  We\r\n\r\nwill  take  an example of the zinc  roof  structure.  If you want to touch it up well to  give\r\n\r\nit an attractive appearance, it will cost about\r\n\r\nthree times the compensation\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npaid  to  the  farmer. So we  can  see  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's rate of compensation is quite unfair\r\n\r\nand unreasonable, and this is a great blow to the\r\n\r\nfarmers. This is a very serious matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to list the third point regarding\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties of the farmers. You  must  know\r\n\r\nthat  it  takes  a long time for the  farmers  to\r\n\r\nestablish   their  business.  It  can   only   be\r\n\r\nestablished in at least three to five years,  and\r\n\r\nin the course of three to five years, the farmers\r\n\r\nhave  to work very hard. They must till the  land\r\n\r\nwith   great   effort  in  order   to   establish\r\n\r\nthemselves. If we compare this state  of  affairs\r\n\r\nwith  what I have just said in regard to the rate\r\n\r\nof  compensation, the farmers suffer indeed great\r\n\r\nlosses. Let us take the compensation paid to  the\r\n\r\nvillagers  of Chin San Village. As I  have  said,\r\n\r\nthe  compensation  was too  inadequate  to  cover\r\n\r\ntheir losses, and was a great blow to them. Every\r\n\r\nfamily  at that time could get only about  $2,000\r\n\r\nto  $3,000  as compensation, and only a  minority\r\n\r\ngot  about  $5,000 to $6,000. We  know  if  every\r\n\r\nfamily got only $2,000 or $3,000 as compensation,\r\n\r\nthen  when it came to building up their  business\r\n\r\nagain,  this  amount would be  used  up  in  just\r\n\r\nputting up a house. They would not be able to pay\r\n\r\nfor  other amenities out of the compensation.  So\r\n\r\nthe question of safeguard to the farmers' land is\r\n\r\nvery  important. We hope the Government will,  in\r\n\r\nthe   Agricultural   Leases   Bill,   take   into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the interest of  the  farmers  and\r\n\r\nmake provisions to look after the land leased  to\r\n\r\nthem.  In the meantime, I feel that they must  be\r\n\r\ngiven reasonable opportunities for expansion  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  At  present, I know  that  on  some\r\n\r\nprivate  land  the  landlords do  not  allow  the\r\n\r\nlessees to put up chicken runs and pig sties.  In\r\n\r\nrespect   of  arable  land,  the  landlord   will\r\n\r\nrestrict  the activities of the farmers  and  the\r\n\r\nrent  is  rather unreasonable too. As  far  as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  in  the case of private  land  if  a\r\n\r\nfarmer is allowed to build any structure thereon,\r\n\r\nhe  has to comply with certain conditions such as\r\n\r\nthe giving of\r\n\r\n'coffee money', and so it will cost a few\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhundred dollars to put up a simple structure.  I\r\n\r\nhope this additional exploitation of the farmers\r\n\r\nwill  be got rid of by the Government by way  of\r\n\r\npassing  legislation to relieve the  farmers  of\r\n\r\ntheir  difficulties. I hope the Government  will\r\n\r\nalso  do its best, as it should. I know that  in\r\n\r\nthe  Land  Office,  which  is  under  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's   Office,  there   are   many,   many\r\n\r\nregulations and restrictions on the construction\r\n\r\nof  pig  sties  and  chicken runs.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will give farmers facilities  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction   of   chicken   runs   and   other\r\n\r\nagricultural  structures  and  that   the   rent\r\n\r\nimposed  by  the Land Office would be reasonable\r\n\r\nto the farmers. In my ward at the 9th milestone,\r\n\r\nYio  Chu  Kang  Road, there is  an  organisation\r\n\r\nknown   as   the   Rural  People's  Association.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of this Association  have  asked\r\n\r\nthe  Government to reduce the rent. I feel  they\r\n\r\nhave  every  reason to ask for the reduction  of\r\n\r\nthe  rent,  because the place is a  resettlement\r\n\r\narea and the farmers only paid a very cheap rent\r\n\r\nfor  staying  there  before the  area  was  esta\r\n\r\nblished.  The  assessment and  the  ground  rent\r\n\r\nbefore  the  establishment of  the  resettlement\r\n\r\narea  came to only a few dollars per year. Since\r\n\r\nthe  Government  started work  on  resettlement,\r\n\r\nevery  family has been given an acre of land  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government in this resettlement  area.  The\r\n\r\nrent   costs  about  $10  per  year,   and   all\r\n\r\nstructures  thereon  have  to  be  rebuilt   and\r\n\r\nmodified.  As a result of this, the resettlement\r\n\r\narea looks very neat and attractive. But as  far\r\n\r\nas  I  know, this resettlement has dealt a great\r\n\r\nblow  to  the  people's livelihood, because  the\r\n\r\nassessment rates have been reconsidered  against\r\n\r\ntheir  favour. They have to pay ten  times  more\r\n\r\nthan what they used to pay. The assessment rates\r\n\r\non Crown land have been similarly increased, and\r\n\r\nso  they have to pay these increases. Therefore,\r\n\r\nevery  family  has to pay tens of  dollars  more\r\n\r\nevery year. In this resettlement, the Government\r\n\r\nwill  wait for five or six years to collect rent\r\n\r\nor assessment, and so the payment has to be made\r\n\r\nin  one  lump  sum. Every family living  in  the\r\n\r\nresettlement area will then have to pay $100  to\r\n\r\n$200 in one lump sum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the idea of having a\r\n\r\nresettlement  is  to solve the  problems  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers. It is a good idea indeed. But in  actual\r\n\r\nfact   it   seems   that   the   Government    is\r\n\r\nconcentrating  them  in  one  area  in  order  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  exploitation. I hope  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill have a reasonable solution to the question I\r\n\r\nhave raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from what I have said, you\r\n\r\ncan  see  that the livelihood of the  farmers  is\r\n\r\nindeed  a very difficult problem. The economy  of\r\n\r\nthe  rural areas is facing a crisis and is on the\r\n\r\nverge  of  bankruptcy. The farmers have to  worry\r\n\r\nabout  their three meals. In the meantime,  their\r\n\r\ndebts    are   continuously   rising.   Generally\r\n\r\nspeaking, the average farmer living in the  rural\r\n\r\narea   is  heavily  indebted.  The  farmers   now\r\n\r\ncomplain  that  the promises made by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbefore  they  came to power were very attractive.\r\n\r\nThey  had all sorts of plans on rural development\r\n\r\nin order to improve the standard of livelihood of\r\n\r\nthe  farmers. But 2\ufffd years have gone by  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have done very little to improve  the\r\n\r\nliving  conditions of the farmers. Their standard\r\n\r\nof  livelihood has not been improved. In fact, it\r\n\r\nhas deteriorated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the last few days, a sum of\r\n\r\nmoney  has been approved in respect of  the  Main\r\n\r\nEstimates,  and  the  Development  Estimates  for\r\n\r\n1962. The sum approved is the highest so far, and\r\n\r\nI  hope the Government will be able to make  good\r\n\r\nuse  of this money to look after the requirements\r\n\r\nof  the people. They should not make use of  this\r\n\r\nmoney  to  do superficial things or to  cover  up\r\n\r\ntheir failures and shortcomings. They should  not\r\n\r\nbluff the people and bring about a phoney merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the Government that they\r\n\r\nshould  not sacrifice the interest of the  people\r\n\r\nfor the sake of a minority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, after reading the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech and after listening to\r\n\r\nthe speech by the Deputy Prime Minister today,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwho  made  a  very  unrealistic  impression,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I am reminded of a proverb  which\r\n\r\nsays  that once you are faced with an experience,\r\n\r\nyou  will  learn from it. Once you  have  knocked\r\n\r\nagainst  a wall, you will never do it again.  The\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore are not fools. In  my  view,\r\n\r\nafter more than two years of actual experience, I\r\n\r\ndoubt  the  beautiful promises of the Government.\r\n\r\nIn  spite  of  the emphasis of the Government  on\r\n\r\nindustrialisation and a common  commodity  market\r\n\r\nfor  the  two territories, after two and  a  half\r\n\r\nyears the industrialisation plan is still a plan.\r\n\r\nI  can  see no improvement in the living standard\r\n\r\nof  the people of Singapore. Up to now, the talks\r\n\r\nin respect of the common commodity market for the\r\n\r\ntwo  territories  are  still  at  the  discussion\r\n\r\nstage.  In  my  view,  success  is  very  remote.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the beautiful promises and  plans  of\r\n\r\nthe Government are just like stones being boiled,\r\n\r\nas they can never be boiled. We can only hear the\r\n\r\nbubbling noises made by the stones in the  stove.\r\n\r\nThese  plans sound nice to the ear but, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthey are impractical. They are just like biscuits\r\n\r\ndrawn  on  paper  which cannot be  eaten  by  the\r\n\r\npeople.  On other Government plans also,  success\r\n\r\nis  very  remote. For example, in the  Government\r\n\r\nelection pamphlet concerning women's rights, many\r\n\r\npromises   were  made.  They  spoke   about   the\r\n\r\nprotection  of  women's rights and raising  their\r\n\r\nstatus  in  society. But after coming  to  power,\r\n\r\nthey  have forgotten all these promises.  We  can\r\n\r\nsee no benefits to the women. The Government said\r\n\r\nthat they would help to protect the rights of the\r\n\r\nworkers. But today they have become anti-workers.\r\n\r\nAs  to the improvement of the rural areas and the\r\n\r\nraising of the standard of livelihood of the  far\r\n\r\nmers, this is all forgotten. I was brought up and\r\n\r\nI  have  lived  in the rural areas. Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand very well the sufferings of the  rural\r\n\r\npeople.   I   have  a  deep  concern  for   these\r\n\r\nsufferings.  During those days, the  P.A.P. made\r\n\r\npromises that they wanted to improve the  lot  of\r\n\r\nthe farmers and of the people living in the rural\r\n\r\nareas,   and  these  promises  were   very   well\r\n\r\nreceived. I was also attracted by these  promises\r\n\r\nmade by the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

It\r\n\r\nshe  wants  to mention the troubles  of  farmers\r\n\r\nagain, perhaps she can do that in passing, but I\r\n\r\nthink the Member for Jalan Kayu made a very long\r\n\r\nand detailed speech about that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  what  I want to talk about is the beautiful\r\n\r\nplans  and promises of the Government which  have\r\n\r\nnot  materialised. We do not see any  results  at\r\n\r\nall.  On  the  other  hand,  the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  not realistic.  The  contents  or\r\n\r\ntheir  policy are lost and there is only an empty\r\n\r\nshell left. For instance, in the policy statement\r\n\r\nof  the  first  Session, it was stated  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would try its best to promote  agricul\r\n\r\nture, animal husbandry and fisheries. But in  the\r\n\r\npolicy  statement of the second Session  entitled\r\n\r\n\"The Year of Construction\", the Government talked\r\n\r\nabout  providing the farmers with fertilisers  in\r\n\r\norder  to  reduce the cost of their  agricultural\r\n\r\nproduce.   It   was  also  mentioned   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  tried  to  improve  the  strains   of\r\n\r\nchickens  in  order to increase the stock.  There\r\n\r\nwas also mention that Government intended to help\r\n\r\nthe fishermen to fish along the seashore of Singa\r\n\r\npore. If all these schemes had been carried  out,\r\n\r\nthey    would    have   been   quite    practical\r\n\r\nachievements.  But  in the policy  statement  for\r\n\r\nthis  session, we cannot see any proposal of this\r\n\r\nsort. Perhaps there could have been no results to\r\n\r\nannounce\r\n\r\nin the policy statement. It seems that the work\r\n\r\nto he done in the rural areas cannot\r\n\r\nbe  carried out, or whether that was carried  out\r\n\r\nwas  not quite up to expectations. In short,  the\r\n\r\nwork  in  respect  of rural improvement  and  all\r\n\r\nprojects to be implemented in the rural areas are\r\n\r\nin a very pitiful state. There are no results and\r\n\r\nthe  improvement of livelihood of farmers has not\r\n\r\nbeen  realised.  The  cost  of  fertilisers   for\r\n\r\ngrowing  vegetables and of food for  poultry  has\r\n\r\nnot been reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The Government have not paid attention to\r\n\r\nthe  livelihood of the farmers and people in the\r\n\r\nrural  areas, but instead they have been talking\r\n\r\nabout  providing amenities to the rural  people.\r\n\r\nAll this talk is not realistic and practical. If\r\n\r\nyou  do  not  look after the livelihood  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers,  then they will not have the  necessary\r\n\r\nmoney to buy fertilisers for growing vegetables,\r\n\r\nof  to rear poultry. Therefore, all this talk of\r\n\r\nhelping them by scientific aids and agricultural\r\n\r\nknowledge  is  useless,  even  after  they  have\r\n\r\nlearnt  all  the scientific methods  of  raising\r\n\r\nchickens, farm keeping, land cultivation, and so\r\n\r\non and so forth, what is the use if they have no\r\n\r\nmoney  to  apply  their knowledge  Therefore  in\r\n\r\norder   to  develop  the  rural  areas  and   to\r\n\r\nsafeguard   the  livelihood  of   the   farmers,\r\n\r\nGovernment should try to do something  concrete.\r\n\r\nIf   the  livelihood  of  the  farmers  is   not\r\n\r\nprotected  and  not well looked  after,  then  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Government policy in this respect  is\r\n\r\ndoomed to failure. Anyway, Mr Speaker, Sir,  in\r\n\r\npresenting its policy, Government wishes to  put\r\n\r\nup  a  beautiful facade and disregard  the  true\r\n\r\nmeaning  of  its  contents.  This  is   a   very\r\n\r\nirresponsible attitude.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Government's industrialisation policy\r\n\r\nand plan to solve the problem of unemployment, I\r\n\r\nfeel this is similar to the wrong policy adopted\r\n\r\nin  regard to the farmers. Because of  the  past\r\n\r\ncolonial economic policy, the farmers are  in  a\r\n\r\nvery  bad  position  today. They  are  in  great\r\n\r\ndifficulty.  It  is quite correct  to  say  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no arable land in Singapore  for  the\r\n\r\ncultivation of staple food. But to say that  the\r\n\r\nfarmers cannot grow them is not correct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmers have the ability to grow them but\r\n\r\ntheir  economy is hampered. Even then they  grow\r\n\r\nfood not only for their own consumption but they\r\n\r\nalso\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2557</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsupply   food   to  neighbouring  countries.   If\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  look after the  production  of\r\n\r\nsupplementary items of food, then they  would  be\r\n\r\ncontributing  much to the economy  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  are  about 20,000 farmers engaged  in  the\r\n\r\nproduction of supplementary items of food for the\r\n\r\nneeds  of Singapore, and the livelihood of  these\r\n\r\n20,000  families are directly affected  by  their\r\n\r\nincomes. Moreover, the national income  is  in  a\r\n\r\nway  affected  by the purchasing power  of  their\r\n\r\nproduce  of  these  farmers.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nfluctuations   in  the  prices  of   agricultural\r\n\r\nproduce  also  affect  the  livelihood  of  these\r\n\r\nfarmers.  The market for supplementary foodstuffs\r\n\r\nis  now  facing  keen  competition  from  outside\r\n\r\nproducers. The market prices are fluctuating  all\r\n\r\nthe  time and the trend is downward, because  the\r\n\r\ncost  of production is high and also because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  not properly looking  after  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the farmers. The farmers are not  able\r\n\r\nto  keep up with this competition, and therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  development of agriculture is  hampered.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers are free, they can go to the rural\r\n\r\nareas and farms to have a look. They can see  the\r\n\r\nvery  pitiable state of things there.  Everything\r\n\r\nis  in a tattered and dilapidated state. All  the\r\n\r\npig  sties and chicken sheds are near collapsing,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  farmers are very poor and  have  no\r\n\r\nmoney  to repair them. Many of them, with a  very\r\n\r\nsorrowful  heart, have come to the city  to  look\r\n\r\nfor employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Therefore,   if   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   want  to  solve   the   problem   of\r\n\r\nunemployment,  they should look at  it  from  all\r\n\r\naspect, adopting various methods to deal with it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2558</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for industrialisation, the policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment  depends too much on  foreign  capital\r\n\r\nand  neglects local capital. They have  neglected\r\n\r\ntheir   own   responsibility  to   help   cottage\r\n\r\nindustries.  This is a very wrong attitude.  From\r\n\r\nexamples in Japan and Hong Kong, we can see  that\r\n\r\ntheir   industrial  products  are  flooding   our\r\n\r\nmarkets.  Our  new  local and cottage  industries\r\n\r\nhave  not been promoted and encouraged and cannot\r\n\r\ncompete  with them, and they are faced  with  the\r\n\r\nprospect of being eliminated. If Government could\r\n\r\nencourage and promote local light industries  and\r\n\r\ncottage  industries, then unemployment  in  Singa\r\n\r\npore will be reduced. Women too will benefit from\r\n\r\nthe setting up of cottage industries, because new\r\n\r\navenues of employment will be open to them.  This\r\n\r\nwill  help to a great extent the economy  of  the\r\n\r\nwhole nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as to the question of the\r\n\r\nSingapore   River,  the  Government  have   made\r\n\r\nbeautiful plans but have not carried them out. I\r\n\r\nwould like to take the opportunity here to quote\r\n\r\na   publication  of  the  Ministry  of   Culture\r\n\r\nentitled \"The Plans of the People\". On  page  16\r\n\r\nof  the  Chinese version, the importance of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore River is stressed. It states that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore River will be improved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This river is the lifeline of the entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade of Singapore. On this river you have  some\r\n\r\n2,000  specially built vessels going to and  fro\r\n\r\nto load and unload goods. About half the imports\r\n\r\nand exports of Singapore are handled by lighters\r\n\r\nin the Singapore River. In fact, a great deal of\r\n\r\nthe imports and exports in Singapore have to  go\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Singapore River.  Stevedores,  who\r\n\r\nnumber about 4,000, and workers on the lighters,\r\n\r\nwho number about 2,000, are given opportunities\r\n\r\nfor employment because of the Singapore\r\n\r\nRiver.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since Government have\r\n\r\nstressed the importance of the Singapore  River,\r\n\r\nhow is it that they have not done anything about\r\n\r\nit?  Just now the Acting Prime Minister said  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech that if we have a plan but no  money\r\n\r\nto  implement it, then it is nothing  more  than\r\n\r\nslogan-shouting. I would ask:  if  you  had  the\r\n\r\nmoney but no plan to utilise the money, then how\r\n\r\nwould you call this state of affairs?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2559</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, then they talk about the urban\r\n\r\nservices.  I feel that since the P.A.P. came  to\r\n\r\npower, they have a very strange policy in dealing\r\n\r\nwith welfare services in the urban areas. In some\r\n\r\ndistricts, the Government have done a great  deal\r\n\r\nin   respect  of  welfare  services   and   urban\r\n\r\namenities.  This  is because the  Ministers  come\r\n\r\nfrom  these  constituencies.  In  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  there  are  services  like   the\r\n\r\nrepair of roads, the putting up of standpipes and\r\n\r\nthe  building of community centres. Creches  have\r\n\r\nalso  been built. But in the other constituencies\r\n\r\nnothing seems to have been done. For example,  in\r\n\r\nthe  Stamford  constituency, the Government  have\r\n\r\nset  up  only one standpipe. The Government  will\r\n\r\nonly  go  according to its interest and whims  to\r\n\r\ncarry out welfare services in the urban areas. If\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  like any particular  Member,  then\r\n\r\nnothing   will  be  done  in  his  or   her   own\r\n\r\nconstituency.  This  is not  what  a  responsible\r\n\r\ngovernment should do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just now I have touched upon\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore River. Stamford Ward has  an  area\r\n\r\nconnected with the Singapore River. Many  workers\r\n\r\nin  this  particular area belong to the  Stamford\r\n\r\nWard.  I  have  received  complaints  from  these\r\n\r\nworkers.  The complaints come from three sources.\r\n\r\nSome  come  from the workers, some from  lighter-owners, and some from businessmen. The complaints\r\n\r\nof  the workers are that the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nhave  not  done anything to repair the  Singapore\r\n\r\nRiver  and  so this has caused some inconvenience\r\n\r\nto  their  work. The complaints of  the  lighter-owners  are mainly that because the river bed  is\r\n\r\nnot deep enough, the lighters get easily damaged.\r\n\r\nThe businessmen's complaints are that because the\r\n\r\nriver  bed  is not deep enough, it is  impossible\r\n\r\nfor  the  lighters to go near the shore when  the\r\n\r\ntide is low. As a result, the lighters have to be\r\n\r\nanchored in the middle of the river at low  tide.\r\n\r\nWhen this is discovered by the Marine Police, the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen   or  lighter-owners   will   receive\r\n\r\nsummonses.   To   put  it  in  a  nutshell,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment have done nothing about the Singapore\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nRiver. Hence we have all these troubles. I feel\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government's aim in  passing  a  law\r\n\r\nshould  not mainly be to fine people so  as  to\r\n\r\nincrease their revenue. Their aim should be  to\r\n\r\nso regulate the affairs of the people that they\r\n\r\nwill  not  go  out of hand. It is not  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to pass a law to fine the people. If\r\n\r\na  lot of summonses and fines are being imposed\r\n\r\non  the  people,  then the Government  have  to\r\n\r\nreview their policy and the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is very regrettable for\r\n\r\nme  to  say  that  the policy  speech  of  this\r\n\r\nsession  has  forgotten entirely the  women  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   who  constitute  about   half   the\r\n\r\npopulation.   The  Government  seem   to   have\r\n\r\nneglected  the  role which women  can  play  in\r\n\r\nnation  building. The Government have also  for\r\n\r\ngotten the policy they made regarding women  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I feel it is very strange  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  policy speech of this Session,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen no mention of women of Singapore. It seems\r\n\r\nthat  all  the problems of women are solved  by\r\n\r\nthe  passage  of  the Women's Charter.  It  was\r\n\r\nstated  in  the manifesto of the P.A.P. during\r\n\r\nthe election that it was the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe  Party  to liberate the women of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  Women's Charter is only a part and not the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  the  work of liberation.  There  are\r\n\r\nother  more important work which the Government\r\n\r\nhave  not  done during their term of office  so\r\n\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope to have your\r\n\r\nindulgence to talk about women's problems.  But\r\n\r\nbefore   I   do  so,  we  must  recognise   one\r\n\r\nprinciple.  The  women  themselves  are  not  a\r\n\r\nproblem. In a very unreasonable society,  women\r\n\r\nhave  to face many problems. It is only because\r\n\r\nof  an  unreasonable social system  that  these\r\n\r\nproblems have arisen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, before any reform is made to the\r\n\r\nunreasonable  social system, the  sufferings  of\r\n\r\nthe women cannot be solved basically. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  want  to touch upon the fact that this Govern\r\n\r\nment  which  have come forward in  the  name  of\r\n\r\nsocialism, have in the course of their office of\r\n\r\nabout two and a half years, seen the sufferings\r\n\r\nof  women without doing anything about it. Great\r\n\r\nproblems cannot be solved. Minor\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2561</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproblems  are not solved either. The unreasonable\r\n\r\ntreatment  which  women  experienced  before  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  election  still  exists,  although   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been in office for two years.  For\r\n\r\nexample, when a woman gets married, she can  only\r\n\r\nget  a  temporary post. The post which  she  held\r\n\r\nbefore  her marriage has to be converted  from  a\r\n\r\npermanent  basis to a temporary basis. This  post\r\n\r\non a temporary basis is not a very secure one for\r\n\r\nher. She is liable to dismissal or termination of\r\n\r\nservices  at  any time. And so this  unreasonable\r\n\r\ncondition  of  service is not only  a  threat  to\r\n\r\nmarried   women,  but  it  is  also  a  sort   of\r\n\r\nexploitation  in  the treatment of  women.  These\r\n\r\ntemporary  officers cannot enjoy pensions.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  understand this talk about encouraging women\r\n\r\nto get out of the kitchen, when in the administra\r\n\r\ntion  and in politics, in business as well as  in\r\n\r\nindustry, in education and in other aspects,  the\r\n\r\nleaders  are  not the women. I do not  understand\r\n\r\nwhat  sort of policy the Government are  adopting\r\n\r\non  socialism. I do not understand also  on  what\r\n\r\nlogical  basis the Government are going to  raise\r\n\r\nthe status of women in society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the problems of women have\r\n\r\nclose reference to the legal, political, economic\r\n\r\nsocial aspects. All\r\n\r\nsorts  of inequalities in those aspects  which  I\r\n\r\nhave just mentioned should be eliminated, because\r\n\r\nit  is  due to these inequalities that the  women\r\n\r\nhave to be confronted with so many problems.  The\r\n\r\neconomic  and  political  aspects  are  the  main\r\n\r\nthings.  If  women  are able  to  be  independent\r\n\r\neconomically so that they will not have to depend\r\n\r\non  others  for  a  living, then  all  the  other\r\n\r\nproblems  will be easily solved. At present,  the\r\n\r\nsituation is like this. Whether you are a man  or\r\n\r\na  woman,  it is very difficult to get a  job  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And  so a woman who  has  got  a  job\r\n\r\nthrough  her good fortune may be confronted  with\r\n\r\nthe  danger  of losing her job and  her  economic\r\n\r\nindependence   after   marriage.    Under    such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, she may have to depend  on  others\r\n\r\nfor  her  livelihood. If her husband's income  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient,  then the question  of  economy  is\r\n\r\nvery important to her family. If he happens\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2562</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  be  irresponsible, then her  burden  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased  manifold. In the Five-Year  Programme,\r\n\r\nthe election plan of the P.A.P., it is stated  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  paragraph of the 3rd  edition  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese version that it is the basic principle of\r\n\r\nsocialism to have equal opportunities for all con\r\n\r\ncerned,  that is to say, in respect of employment\r\n\r\nand working conditions. Equality must be given to\r\n\r\nall  people irrespective of sex, and there should\r\n\r\nbe  no  discrimination of  one  sex  against  the\r\n\r\nother.  At present in the Government service  and\r\n\r\nthe leading commercial houses, it is quite common\r\n\r\nfor   married   women  to  have  their   services\r\n\r\nterminated,  and it is also very common  to  have\r\n\r\nmarried  women considered as temporary employees.\r\n\r\nThis is only a result of prejudice, that only men\r\n\r\ncan be the leaders of the families and that wives\r\n\r\nare  only part and parcel of the property of  the\r\n\r\nhusband.  It  is a very traditional prejudice  to\r\n\r\nsay that it is the duty of the wife to look after\r\n\r\nthe  family  and the children. Now this  is  very\r\n\r\nunfair,  because  a married woman  also  has  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility   of   maintaining   her   family,\r\n\r\nespecially when the husband is irresponsible  and\r\n\r\nsimply   deserts   her  and   the   family.   The\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  such a  woman  is  very  much\r\n\r\ngreater.  We cannot deny the right of  the  woman\r\n\r\nto! earn a living just because she is married. We\r\n\r\ncannot have unequal treatment in respect of women\r\n\r\nin their employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. laid down many\r\n\r\nattractive  policies  before  the  election,  but\r\n\r\nafter it has taken office it has not carried  out\r\n\r\nits  policies. Then there is talk about equal pay\r\n\r\nfor equal work in respect of men and women alike.\r\n\r\nThis  is also a basic problem of women. This  can\r\n\r\nonly  come about when socialism is achieved,  but\r\n\r\nit  seems that the Party in power is not  sincere\r\n\r\nin  going  in  this direction.  The  solution  to\r\n\r\nwomen's   problems  lies  in  the  economic   and\r\n\r\npolitical improvement of the status of women, and\r\n\r\nthis question can only be solved gradually day by\r\n\r\nday.  Now, in the interim period before the whole\r\n\r\nquestion is solved basically,\r\n\r\nyou  must  make  some partial  improvements  with\r\n\r\nsincerity.   For   example,  in  the   Government\r\n\r\nservice, women officers\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2563</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  lady  teachers are doing the  same  kind  of\r\n\r\nwork as their men counterparts. So the Government\r\n\r\nmust make sure that they get the same pay. If the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are not protecting the  interests  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  employees, how can they expect  other\r\n\r\nemployers  to give equal treatment to  women?  If\r\n\r\nthe Government deal with women from the point  of\r\n\r\nview of a capitialist, whose main concern is only\r\n\r\nto  make  money, then maternity leave will  be  a\r\n\r\nloss  to  the  women. If that is the  case,  then\r\n\r\nthere  is no use for the Government to talk about\r\n\r\nsocialism and the protection of the interests  of\r\n\r\nwomen.  In social reform and social work,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  right for the social worker, who talks about\r\n\r\nsocialism, to suppress one half of the population\r\n\r\non  the one hand and, on the other hand, to  talk\r\n\r\nabout  social reform. That is really  a  laughing\r\n\r\nstock.  Social  progress  must  be  made  in  all\r\n\r\nrespects,  since  women are part  and  parcel  of\r\n\r\nsociety. They should not be discriminated against\r\n\r\nor neglected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me give some examples\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Five-Year Plan of  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nprove  further that the Government say one  thing\r\n\r\nand  do  another thing. Mr Speaker, Sir, in  the\r\n\r\nFive-Year Plan of the Government, at page 8  of\r\n\r\nthe 3rd edition in Chinese, it is stated that  at\r\n\r\nthe  time of the so-called elected government  of\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  Yew Hock, it was trying to  please  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  rower  by all means and the  Government\r\n\r\nthen did nothing to improve the lot of women, and\r\n\r\nthat  in future, the P.A.P. Government would  get\r\n\r\nrid  of  all  such  unreasonable conditions.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, at that time these attractive words\r\n\r\nand  premises  of the Government were  very  well\r\n\r\nreceived  and  supported by the people.  But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have taken power for some  two  years\r\n\r\nand  what  have they done during this period?  As\r\n\r\nfar  as the powers of the present Government  are\r\n\r\nconcerned, these are wider than these of the  Lim\r\n\r\nYew Hock Government, but as far as the actions of\r\n\r\nthis  present  Government are concerned,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  just  the same.  In  fact,  this\r\n\r\nGovernment is even worse than the Lim\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2564</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nYew  Hock  Government, in trying to please  the\r\n\r\ncolonial  power.  The  unreasonable  laws   and\r\n\r\nconditions are still\r\n\r\nin existence. It is not necessary for me to say\r\n\r\nmore about this. I want to ask the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment whether or not they feel ashamed of\r\n\r\nthemselves - [Interruption]\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):In the past,\r\n\r\nthe Party used to ridicule others - [Interruption].\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Battle of the sexes again!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the second point in  line  6  on\r\n\r\npage 9 of the same pamphlet,\r\n\r\nis:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When we assume office in future, we will take\r\n\r\nall  steps  possible to solve the  problems  of\r\n\r\nwomen.

There\r\n\r\nis a women's section of the Party in power, but\r\n\r\nthere  is no celebration of Women's Day,  which\r\n\r\nis  recognised internationally and which  falls\r\n\r\non the 3rd of August every year. In the time of\r\n\r\nthe   Lim  Yew  Hock  Government,  the  present\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home Affairs led  the  women  in\r\n\r\nprotest against the ban on the celebrations  of\r\n\r\nWomen's Day.\r\n\r\nBut now the Party has taken office and\r\n\r\nyet there is no celebration of Women's Day.  So\r\n\r\nwhy  talk  about  fighting for the  freedom  of\r\n\r\nwomen? Why talk about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2565</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimproving the political status of women? I think\r\n\r\nthis is all humbug. This humbug\r\n\r\ncannot be seen. It looks like the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome Affairs is dozing\r\n\r\noff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I want to\r\n\r\ntouch on the economic aspect. I feel that the\r\n\r\nGovernment have not only\r\n\r\nfailed to encourage light industries, but have\r\n\r\nalso neglected light industries.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about the care to be given to\r\n\r\nwidows and orphans as promised; I feel that the\r\n\r\nGovernment have not only failed to look after\r\n\r\nthese\r\n\r\npeople, but have also reduced the public\r\n\r\nassistance given to these poor people.\r\n\r\nSo the Government say one thing and do another\r\n\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me raise my third point\r\n\r\nwhich is mentioned in page 4, line 7 of the  same\r\n\r\nbooklet in the Chinese version. It reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The P.A.P. Government will try its best to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  rights of women workers  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  be  given  equal pay  and  favourable\r\n\r\nworking conditions. In the meantime, we will  try\r\n\r\nto make sure that women will get\r\n\r\ntheir maternity allowances.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is  also stated in the same booklet that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  legislate to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ninterests of women are protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, generally speaking, women\r\n\r\nworkers  can only dream of these promises.  Their\r\n\r\ninterest  is  not looked after by the Government.\r\n\r\nLet  me bring up the matter of the lady teachers.\r\n\r\nAs  far as I know, in some Chinese aided schools,\r\n\r\nthe  women teachers have to pay to get people  to\r\n\r\ndo their work during their period of confinement.\r\n\r\nNow if they have financial difficulties -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On a point of clarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): No. If a\r\n\r\nwoman   teacher  cannot  afford  to  pay  another\r\n\r\nteacher, then her work has to be shared among her\r\n\r\ncolleagues,  otherwise her  class  will  have  no\r\n\r\nteacher.  Therefore,  taking  into  consideration\r\n\r\nthis  state  of  affairs, how can the  Government\r\n\r\ntalk about giving protection to women?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2566</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another point\r\n\r\nwhich  is  contained  in page  12  of  the  same\r\n\r\nbooklet  in  the Chinese version.  The  subtitle\r\n\r\nreads  \"Research Institute of Women's Problems\".\r\n\r\nIt  is  stated in this booklet that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  going  to establish  a  Research\r\n\r\nInstitute of Women's Problems to enable women of\r\n\r\nall  races to study the problems of women.  This\r\n\r\nResearch   Institute  will   include   all   the\r\n\r\ndepartments  concerned in all aspects,  such  as\r\n\r\npolitics, economics, health, culture, children's\r\n\r\nwelfare, etc, in order\r\n\r\nto help the women to contribute to society and\r\n\r\nto the country. This Research Institute of\r\n\r\nWomen's Problems is a good idea. But the\r\n\r\nGovernment have not carried out this promise\r\n\r\nsince they took office. I do not know whether\r\n\r\nthey are sincere in establishing such an\r\n\r\nInstitute\r\n\r\nand I wonder when it will be established. I want\r\n\r\nto remind the Government that\r\n\r\nthey  have gone through more than half of  their\r\n\r\nfive-year  term of office. If this is  not  done\r\n\r\nimmediately, there will\r\n\r\nhardly he any time left for the Government to do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the third item shown in the\r\n\r\nsame pamphlet concerns culture\r\n\r\nand education. It reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We want to encourage the cultures of the\r\n\r\nvarious  races  so that these cultures  will  be\r\n\r\nintermingled to become a united Malayan culture.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we want to suppress undesirable\r\n\r\nand immoral cultures which come from outside. We\r\n\r\nwant  to stop the yellow culture promoters  from\r\n\r\npoisoning  the thoughts of the people.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat  yellow culture has a very direct influence\r\n\r\non the women who are always the victims. We want\r\n\r\nto  suppress yellow culture in order  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  women  and  children will  be  spiritually\r\n\r\nhealthy.   On  the  other  hand,  we   want   to\r\n\r\nconsolidate the education of women. We  want  to\r\n\r\nset   up  adult  educational  classes  all  over\r\n\r\nSingapore to educate illiterate women.  We  want\r\n\r\nto  make use of many Senior Middle III graduates\r\n\r\nwho  are unemployed so that they can go into the\r\n\r\nrural  areas to educate the womenfolk.  In  this\r\n\r\nway, on the one hand, we can suppress the spread\r\n\r\nof  yellow  culture  and,  on  the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nenhance the education of women so that we may be\r\n\r\nable to raise the moral standard of society.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, talking about culture, I am reminded of the\r\n\r\npathetic  Ministry of Culture.

Perhaps it seems  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment have done enough to exterminate yellow\r\n\r\nculture and so there is no point for them  to  do\r\n\r\nanything more to suppress yellow culture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of women's problems again, it\r\n\r\nseems  that  the  Government are quite  satisfied\r\n\r\nsince passing the Women's Charter.

I want to ask the Government why  they\r\n\r\nhave  increased the school fees for girls. Is  it\r\n\r\ncompatible with the promise of consolidating  the\r\n\r\neducation  of  women?  Does  it  mean  that   the\r\n\r\nstandard of education of the girls will be raised\r\n\r\nbecause  of  an increase in the school  fees  for\r\n\r\ngirls?  The  Government have promised  that  they\r\n\r\nwill  help  to raise the status of  women  to  an\r\n\r\nequal footing with that of men. But does it  mean\r\n\r\nthat  this  has been achieved because the  school\r\n\r\nfees  of  the girls have been raised to those  of\r\n\r\nthe  boys?  I  must point that  if  there  is  no\r\n\r\nimprovement in the pay of women and there  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in the burden that they have to  carry,\r\n\r\nthen  how  can  the policy of the  Government  be\r\n\r\ntermed  to  be  one of protecting the  rights  of\r\n\r\nwomen?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past two years, the\r\n\r\nprestige  of the Government has sunk low  in  the\r\n\r\neyes  of  the  people.

On  hearing\r\n\r\nall  these, they scold the people, brand them  as\r\n\r\nCommunists, and accuse them of having been bought\r\n\r\nover  by the Communists. This kind of talk  seems\r\n\r\nto  give  the people the impression that  the  Go\r\n\r\nvernment are treating them like children. Now, if\r\n\r\nthese   people   are  so  gullible   and   easily\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by  the Communists,  why  cannot  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  easily influence them  as  well?  The\r\n\r\nGovernment attempt to use these smears as a means\r\n\r\nto  suppress the reasonable claims of the people.\r\n\r\nBut,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the  people  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsuppressed forever. They are suffering and as the\r\n\r\nunemployment problem becomes more and more acute,\r\n\r\nthe  difficulties of getting employment  increase\r\n\r\nand  the people are dissatisfied with the present\r\n\r\nstate  of affairs. All these have led the  people\r\n\r\nto  make  their reasonable and legitimate claims.\r\n\r\nThis is but natural. How can the Government blame\r\n\r\nthe  people and how can the Government call these\r\n\r\npeople Communists?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I personally feel that\r\n\r\noriginally the people did not find fault with the\r\n\r\nGovernment. They were not dissatisfied  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  originally. They were really  unhappy\r\n\r\nat  their exploitation under colonial rule.  They\r\n\r\nwere  dissatisfied  with  the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil imposing limitations and restrictions  on\r\n\r\nthe   present  Government.  The  people  had  the\r\n\r\nimpression that the Government's hands were  tied\r\n\r\nbecause of the existence of the Internal Security\r\n\r\nCouncil.   They  thought  it  was  the   Internal\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council  that tied  the  hands  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  prevent them  from  serving  the\r\n\r\npeople   of   Singapore   and   improving   their\r\n\r\nconditions. The people were in sympathy with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment;   so  they  tried   to   assist   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  solve  their  difficulties.  They\r\n\r\nwanted  to  work hand in hand with the Government\r\n\r\nto  get rid of these unreasonable conditions,  so\r\n\r\nthat the Government would have greater powers  to\r\n\r\nserve the people.

In this  way,  the\r\n\r\npeople can see clearly that the P.A.P. is now a\r\n\r\nreactionary Party which is working in collusion\r\n\r\nwith the colonialists to go against the people.\r\n\r\nInstead  of accepting the claims of the  people\r\n\r\nto get rid of the Internal Security Council, it\r\n\r\nseems that the Government have the intention to\r\n\r\npreserve  its existence in order  to  cover  up\r\n\r\ntheir  shortcomings in serving the people.

Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  fact  that  the political  detainees\r\n\r\ncannot  be released is a very good example.  As\r\n\r\nthe  saying  goes, the people can shoulder  all\r\n\r\nsorts   of   things  but  nobody   can   accept\r\n\r\nstarvation. There is another saying - if we  have\r\n\r\nno freedom, we will rather, die. The people are\r\n\r\nvery realistic.

[Interruption]  But  what  the\r\n\r\npeople  are  afraid is the lack of freedom  and\r\n\r\nbread. Are the Government trying to satisfy the\r\n\r\ntwo  basic  demands of the people?  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, bread and freedom are the demands\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  The important  point  of  the\r\n\r\nsocial  problem is called politics.

Mr Deputy Speaker, to achieve a  society\r\n\r\nin  which there would he no exploitation of  man\r\n\r\nby  man  is a long-term objective.

Mr  Deputy Speaker, when the  Right-wing\r\n\r\nParty  of Lim Yew Hock saw the division  in  our\r\n\r\nLeft-wing Party, they were very happy. I wish to\r\n\r\ntell them that they cannot benefit from this con\r\n\r\nfused  situation  in  the Left-wing  camp.  They\r\n\r\ncannot  stage a comeback as a result of this.  I\r\n\r\ntell them that they have no hope of doing this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we and the Members of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, who were formerly Members  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., have had differences in  regard  to\r\n\r\nour    political   stand   and   our   political\r\n\r\nphilosophy. The former P.A.P. Members, i.e., the\r\n\r\npresent  Members of the Barisan  Sosialis,  have\r\n\r\nleft the P.A.P. Some people think that our Party\r\n\r\nwill  become a Right-wing Party as a  result  of\r\n\r\nthese former P.A.P. members leaving us. It seems\r\n\r\nthat  they are all Leftists. The Member for Choa\r\n\r\nChu Kang should not be so very arrogant\r\n\r\nin  his conception. In fact, the P.A.P. is still\r\n\r\nthe  same  as before. The policy we are adopting\r\n\r\nto  bring about a merger with the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  is  different from  the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  It  is  only  a  matter   of\r\n\r\ndifference in policy and standpoint.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the Members of the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis attack us whenever they rise to  speak.\r\n\r\nI  feel  very disheartened and very sad  indeed.\r\n\r\nThey  want  to hit at the P.A.P. at  all  costs,\r\n\r\nhoping  that  it  will  collapse  as  early   as\r\n\r\npossible.

They attack us just to get a\r\n\r\nmoment  of pleasure for themselves, but  at  the\r\n\r\ncost  of neglecting the existence of the  common\r\n\r\nenemy.  They are forgetting our common  aim  of\r\n\r\neliminating  our  common  enemy.  This  kind  of\r\n\r\nattitude is contrary to what we should adopt  in\r\n\r\nthe   present   phase   of  our   constitutional\r\n\r\nstruggle.  I  hope the Members  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis will not bully the people too much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, we also recognise the fact\r\n\r\nthat  everything is progressing and  is  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess  of evolution. Of course, there must  be\r\n\r\ncertain   laws   guiding  this   evolution   and\r\n\r\nprogress.  For instance, the chairs, the  tables\r\n\r\nand  the utensils we use every day appear to  be\r\n\r\nthe  same  every  day. But, in fact,  there  are\r\n\r\nchanges  every day in the contents, nature,  and\r\n\r\nsubstance of these articles. They are, in  fact,\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  what  they  have  been  before.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we say that the P.A.P. has, like  the\r\n\r\ncarpenter,   its  own  tasks  to  perform.   The\r\n\r\ncarpenter has his tools to do his work.  If  the\r\n\r\ntools are good, then the structure put up by him\r\n\r\nwill  be  better  and can last  longer.  If  the\r\n\r\nmaterials which are used to build the structures\r\n\r\nare  bad,  then the structures put up with  such\r\n\r\nmaterials will deteriorate and perish very soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regrettable and a pity really that the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  has  disappeared  now.  After\r\n\r\nentering this House, and whenever he stands up to\r\n\r\nspeak, he expects to say something to attract the\r\n\r\napplause of the people. Sometime ago he  said  he\r\n\r\nwanted  to  place Singapore under the control  of\r\n\r\nthe United Nations. Mr Deputy Speaker, nobody in\r\n\r\nany  part  in  the world should  throw  away  the\r\n\r\nhighest concept of patriotism which a human being\r\n\r\nshould  have.  I feel the Member  for  Anson  has\r\n\r\ngiven  up  that highest concept. Perhaps  he  has\r\n\r\nthrown it away. He says we are struggling and  we\r\n\r\nare  about  to die. But I would say  that  he  is\r\n\r\nstruggling in his coffin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, now I want to turn to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Stamford. Just now she attacked  us.\r\n\r\nShe  criticised us and said that we had not  done\r\n\r\nanything  during  our two and  a  half  years  of\r\n\r\noffice.

The  comprehensive\r\n\r\nplans  and  the policy of the P.A.P. have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  criticised  by her. In  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\npresent  society, it is impossible to carry  out\r\n\r\nour  plans  in every detail. It will  take  some\r\n\r\ntime before the present society is reformed. But\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  perform our task  to  realise  our\r\n\r\nobjectives.  Just  now, she has  mentioned  that\r\n\r\nwomen  employees  are  considered  as  temporary\r\n\r\nemployees. On this question, we have already put\r\n\r\nup  our  memorandum to the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\nAs  to  the question of women suffering  for  so\r\n\r\nmany  thousands  of  years,  she  has  our  full\r\n\r\nsympathy and understanding. We cannot forget the\r\n\r\nplight  of  our sisters who have been  suffering\r\n\r\nall these years. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, it  is\r\n\r\nvery  regrettable  that  when  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nStamford  was with us in the P.A.P., she  was  a\r\n\r\ngreat disappointment to us. If she had mentioned\r\n\r\nall the points which she mentioned in this House\r\n\r\njust now, that is, indicated the various ways to\r\n\r\nsolve  all  these problems, then we  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen very thankful to her.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also touched on the point that we have not\r\n\r\ncarried  out the! policy of equal pay for  equal\r\n\r\nwork, irrespective of sex. But had she not  left\r\n\r\nus, she would not have said so, because when she\r\n\r\nwas with us, she had stressed the difficulty  in\r\n\r\nresolving the problems of giving equal  pay  for\r\n\r\nequal work, irrespective of sex. We have said on\r\n\r\nthis  question  that  it is  difficult  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to legislate to provide equal pay for\r\n\r\nequal  work  irrespective of sex,  before  other\r\n\r\nproblems are solved. For instance, when a man is\r\n\r\nunable  to get employment, a woman will find  it\r\n\r\nmore  difficult to get employment.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Stamford will pay more attention  to\r\n\r\nthe  problems of women and try to find out  what\r\n\r\nis the crux of the problem facing our sisters in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and then try to put up  constructive\r\n\r\nsuggestions.  We will be happy  to  consider  or\r\n\r\naccept  them. Here I must say to the Member  for\r\n\r\nStamford that not long ago this year, a  meeting\r\n\r\nof  the South-East Asian Women's Conference  was\r\n\r\nconvened. At that time we\r\n\r\nsuggested that Assemblywomen from the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2575</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOpposition  side should attend this  meeting,  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  could have a mutual discussion  of  the\r\n\r\nproblems relating to women. In the end the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Mountbatten,   in   fact,   attended   this\r\n\r\nconference, but the Member for Stamford  did  not\r\n\r\nattend. When I returned to Singapore, I told her,\r\n\r\n\"My good friend, Fung Yin Ching -\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Who is Fung Yin Ching? Is\r\n\r\nshe a Member of this Assembly?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Hoe Puay Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Hoe Puay Choo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I was telling you what I told the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Stamford, not that I wanted to  mention  her\r\n\r\nname.  I  said that the South-East Asian  Women's\r\n\r\nConference  had written to invite her to  attend,\r\n\r\nbut why did she not attend? Then she replied, \"Is\r\n\r\nit  really  so?\"  And I told her,  \"We  as  women\r\n\r\nshould   attend  this  Conference  in  order   to\r\n\r\ncontribute our opinion and take part in all kinds\r\n\r\nof  discussion.\"  But when the third  meeting  of\r\n\r\nthis Conference was held, the said Member did not\r\n\r\nattend  again. Then I told the Member  for  Delta\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Stamford did not turn up  for\r\n\r\nthis  meeting, and later on I told Mr Lim  Ching\r\n\r\nSiong,   the  SecretaryGeneral  of  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, that he should encourage her to  attend\r\n\r\nthis  meeting.  In any case, what  happened  ulti\r\n\r\nmately  was that the meeting was not convened  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, because we were not willing to  accept\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from Taiwan to come to Singapore.\r\n\r\nHad  we  accepted, then the Members- who are  now\r\n\r\nsitting opposite would have accused us of working\r\n\r\nin  collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek regime  in\r\n\r\nTaiwan. That is why we were not willing to accept\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  Taiwan  to   attend   this\r\n\r\nspecial  meeting of the South-East Asian  Women's\r\n\r\nConference in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope the Member for\r\n\r\nStamford  will study the problems of women  more\r\n\r\nand then put up constructive suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also touched on the organisation of women.\r\n\r\nShe  should know this question well. We have put\r\n\r\nup this problem\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2576</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  discussion. But the work of organising women\r\n\r\ncould not be put into practice in just one day or\r\n\r\novernight. This problem is still being studied by\r\n\r\nus. Just now the Member for Stamford said that we\r\n\r\nhad  not  tried  to carry out our  duty  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect. But she should know that she should  not\r\n\r\nlook  at things from the outside. She should  try\r\n\r\nto get at the core of the problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also mentioned yellow culture. Now, this is\r\n\r\nsomething which all the people in Singapore  know\r\n\r\nvery well. Since the P.A.P. came into office,  it\r\n\r\nhas  been  very  strict in  dealing  with  yellow\r\n\r\nculture. We have made some great achievements  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect. She should not try to  ignore  our\r\n\r\nachievements in this work. It is to be  regretted\r\n\r\nthat when the Member for Queenstown, the Chairman\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis, was a member of the Film\r\n\r\nCensorship  Appeal Committee, he did  not  oppose\r\n\r\ncertain strip-tease films. Instead he said  these\r\n\r\nstrip-tease shows were not yellow culture. On the\r\n\r\ncontrary, they were good. So I must say that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Stamford should try to persuade  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown, her Chairman. That is only\r\n\r\ncorrect and proper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I refer to what the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Stamford  has said about the  education  of\r\n\r\nwomen in the rural areas. She says we have  done\r\n\r\nnothing  in  this respect. She should  not  have\r\n\r\nsaid so. Mr Deputy Speaker, since we became the\r\n\r\nGovernment we have built many community  centres\r\n\r\nthroughout  Singapore. One of the activities  of\r\n\r\nthese community centres is to help solve women's\r\n\r\nproblems,  because in the community  centres  we\r\n\r\nhave established adult education classes, sewing\r\n\r\nclasses and others. The chief purpose is to help\r\n\r\nwomen,  particular those from families  who  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  send  their children  to  school  to\r\n\r\nreceive  any kind of education because of  their\r\n\r\npoverty  and  economic situation. These  classes\r\n\r\nwhich are conducted in the community centres are\r\n\r\nmeant   to  help  them  solved  their  problems,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of whether the students  attending\r\n\r\nthere  are  men or women. So I should point  out\r\n\r\nthe  mistake in what the Member for Stamford has\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2577</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also mentioned the passing of the Women's\r\n\r\nCharter.  She said that once the Women's  Charter\r\n\r\nhad  been passed, it seemed as though we took  it\r\n\r\nfor  granted that all problems relating to  women\r\n\r\nwere  solved  at one and the same  time.  But  we\r\n\r\nnever had such a conception. We can only say that\r\n\r\nthe  passing of the Women's Charter is one of the\r\n\r\nsteps  forward to solve women's problems.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  the final and only solution in this respect.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I hope that if she wants to review the\r\n\r\nWomen's  Charter  and to suggest any  amendments,\r\n\r\nshe  should consult the other Assemblymen in  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis beforehand; otherwise they  will\r\n\r\nbe  also very confused in the end and cannot come\r\n\r\nto any agreement on what they want to suggest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I agree to what the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Choa Chu Kang has said just now, but he must\r\n\r\nadmit  that our laws have been good. It  is  only\r\n\r\nbecause of their opposition that there have  been\r\n\r\nsome  loopholes now in the laws. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nStamford  says  that  the  school  fees  of  girl\r\n\r\nstudents  have been raised by $1. Now,  I  should\r\n\r\ntell  her that we had made a careful study before\r\n\r\nwe  carried that policy out. Our Party  had  also\r\n\r\ndiscussed this question, namely, the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2578</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nraising  of the school fees by $1. We hope  that\r\n\r\nin  future men and women will have equal  rights\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  sex, but the Members  opposite\r\n\r\nhave  totally  disregarded the contents  of  the\r\n\r\npolicy  statement by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.\r\n\r\nWe  have  clearly  pointed out  in  this  policy\r\n\r\nstatement  that we want to carry out the  policy\r\n\r\nof  giving  equal treatment to all, irrespective\r\n\r\nof sex. If the Member for Stamford, when she was\r\n\r\nwith  us,  had mentioned those points which  she\r\n\r\nhas just mentioned in this Assembly, namely, the\r\n\r\nproblems and the difficulties relating to women,\r\n\r\nthen  we  would have paid attention to what  she\r\n\r\nhad suggested. But she did not do so. Instead of\r\n\r\nwhich she has mentioned this in the House today.\r\n\r\nDoes she have any ulterior motive -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.
