These have  been  further  raised\r\n\r\nfollowing the Bali bombing incident in October 2002.   We\r\n\r\nnow  conduct 100% security checks on all arriving persons\r\n\r\nand  their  belongings at our land and  sea  checkpoints.\r\n\r\nAll  vehicles  passing our land checkpoints are  checked.\r\n\r\nOur  vital installations and high-risk establishments are\r\n\r\nguarded  round  the clock. These include Changi  Airport,\r\n\r\nJurong Island and foreign embassies assessed to be  under\r\n\r\nthreat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also hardened the so-called \"soft\" targets\r\n\r\nsuch   as   hotels,  pubs,  large  entertainment  outlets\r\n\r\nfrequented  by  foreigners and locals,  as  well  as  key\r\n\r\ncommercial and shopping areas.  Besides increasing Police\r\n\r\npatrols  and  deploying  guards,  road  engineering   and\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  works  have  also  been  carried  out  to\r\n\r\nenhance  security.   While the  public  may  suffer  some\r\n\r\ninconvenience,  these  works  are  necessary  to  enhance\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The community's partnership is important in our\r\n\r\nfight  against terrorism.  The Government  cannot  do  it\r\n\r\nalone.   While  the Government would do  all  it  can  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  level of security in Singapore,  business\r\n\r\nand  building owners also have to safeguard the  security\r\n\r\nof their own buildings.  Each building's management has a\r\n\r\npart to play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been proactively engaging specific\r\n\r\ngroups,  such  as  hotel operators and  owners  of  large\r\n\r\ncommercial buildings to brief them on the current  threat\r\n\r\nassessment  and measures that they should take  to  guard\r\n\r\nagainst  a terrorist attack.  For example, following  the\r\n\r\nJakarta's  Marriott Hotel bombing on  5th  August,  hotel\r\n\r\noperators  and owners of large commercial buildings  were\r\n\r\nbriefed by the Ministry of Home Affairs the very next day\r\n\r\non  security  measures  to take.   This  had  a  positive\r\n\r\nimpact.   I am sure Members would have read the newspaper\r\n\r\nreports of a visible increase in the security measures of\r\n\r\nhotels and other public places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, much more can be done. The Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  Coordinating  Minister  for  Security  and\r\n\r\nDefence, Dr Tony Tan and myself, will be meeting the  top\r\n\r\nmanagement of hotel operators, shopping centres, property\r\n\r\nholding  and management companies, to impress  upon  them\r\n\r\nthe  need  to  work  in  partnership  with  the  security\r\n\r\nagencies  to further enhance security measures for  their\r\n\r\nbuildings. The briefing will be held on 2nd September.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with the current security situation requires\r\n\r\nthe collective efforts of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommunity,  the  private sector and  the  security  guard\r\n\r\nagencies. The Police has put in place the National Skills\r\n\r\nRecognition Scheme (NSRS), an accreditation scheme  where\r\n\r\nprivate  security  agencies will be rated  based  on  the\r\n\r\ntraining and capabilities of their security guards.  This\r\n\r\ngrading  exercise should motivate security guard agencies\r\n\r\nto  enhance  the  training  of their  guards  beyond  the\r\n\r\nminimal  level imposed by the Police. The grading  system\r\n\r\nwill  also  provide the customers with better information\r\n\r\nin their selection of security guard agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides encouraging private security agencies to\r\n\r\nupgrade  their skills, the training provided  would  also\r\n\r\nupgrade  the  skills and competency level of the  private\r\n\r\nsecurity   agencies.   One  of  the   core   competencies\r\n\r\nidentified  under  the  scheme is the  handling  of  bomb\r\n\r\nthreats.  This will ensure that security guards  deployed\r\n\r\nat  commercial buildings are equipped with the  necessary\r\n\r\nskills to deal with the terrorist threat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security is now everyone's responsibility.

The flexible\r\n\r\nwage  system should include an Annual Variable  Component\r\n\r\n(AVC)  constituting 20% of total wages linked to  company\r\n\r\nperformance.  Since then, more than 85% of companies have\r\n\r\nimplemented  some  form  of flexible  wage  system.   The\r\n\r\naverage AVC varied from year to year, ranging from 13% to\r\n\r\n16%  of total wages, depending on economic conditions and\r\n\r\nprofitability of firms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further enhance the flexibility of our wage\r\n\r\nsystem, the NWC in 1999 recommended the implementation of\r\n\r\nthe Monthly Variable Component (MVC) to form 10% of total\r\n\r\nwages.    The  recommended  flexible  wage  system   thus\r\n\r\ncomprises 70% fixed basic wages, 20% AVC and 10% MVC.  On\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of MVC, progress has been made in the\r\n\r\nunionised  sector.  As at December 2002, 39% of unionised\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  implemented  the  MVC.   This   compares\r\n\r\nfavourably with 11% in 1999, 29% in 2000 and 34% in 2001.\r\n\r\nIn  the non-unionised sector, however, the implementation\r\n\r\nrate of MVC is significantly lower, registering only 3.9%\r\n\r\nof   non-unionised   companies   surveyed,   a   marginal\r\n\r\nimprovement from 3.4% in 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on feedback from employers, one of the reasons\r\n\r\nfor the slow implemen-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntation  of MVC was the economic downturn in recent years,\r\n\r\nwhich  saw  many  companies granting little  or  no  wage\r\n\r\nincreases.  As MVC was originally recommended to be built\r\n\r\nup  from future wage increases, many companies which  did\r\n\r\nnot  pay  wage  increases were not able to implement  the\r\n\r\ncomponent.  The concern that MVC could only be cut  in  a\r\n\r\nbusiness  loss situation also discouraged companies  from\r\n\r\nimplementing it.  Other reasons inhibiting companies from\r\n\r\nimplementing   MVC   include   the   concern   that   the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  MVC would make wage administration  too\r\n\r\ncomplex.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to our seniority-based wage system, individual\r\n\r\nperformance  and  contribution are  also  not  adequately\r\n\r\nrecognised  and  rewarded.  Changes  should  be  made  to\r\n\r\nreplace   the   seniority-based  wage   system   with   a\r\n\r\nperformance-based wage system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help expedite the implementation of a wage system\r\n\r\nwhich   could   link  rewards  closely  to  company   and\r\n\r\nindividual  performance,  the  Ministry  has  set  up   a\r\n\r\nTripartite  Taskforce  to  study  the  issues  and   make\r\n\r\nrecommendations.

In\r\n\r\ntandem   with  the  development  of  Punggol  Town,   the\r\n\r\ntransportation  system  in the area  has  been  built  up\r\n\r\nsteadily  to  meet  the  needs of its  rising  number  of\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Public transportation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start with developments in public\r\n\r\ntransportation. With the opening of the North  East  Line\r\n\r\n(NEL)  in  June this year, Punggol residents now  have  a\r\n\r\nfast and direct access to the city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bus network has been keeping up with the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of Punggol. Since the opening of NEL, a trunk\r\n\r\nbus  service (Service No. 83) has been extended to  bring\r\n\r\nresidents  to the Punggol MRT station.  This bus  service\r\n\r\nalso  brings residents to Sengkang bus interchange  where\r\n\r\nthey can transfer to other bus services.  Two other trunk\r\n\r\nbus  services (Services 136 and 82) connect residents  to\r\n\r\nother towns such as Hougang, Serangoon and Ang Mo Kio.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ongoing projects to further improve public transport\r\n\r\nservices in Punggol Town include the construction of  the\r\n\r\nPunggol  LRT,  and  a  temporary  bus  interchange  (near\r\n\r\nPunggol   MRT   station).   When   completed,   the   bus\r\n\r\ninterchange will allow the operator to introduce more bus\r\n\r\nservices as the town grows.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me talk about the road network. Within\r\n\r\nPunggol Town itself, roads are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeing  built by HDB in tandem with the planned completion\r\n\r\nof  developments  there.  This is no different  from  how\r\n\r\nroads are provided for in other new towns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Penny Low has been feeding back to us the\r\n\r\nconcerns  of  residents in Punggol about  the  inadequate\r\n\r\nroad  access into Punggol.  We share her concerns.   This\r\n\r\nis  why  we had earlier brought forward road projects  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the road access into Punggol Town.  As a result,\r\n\r\nthe  Land  Transport Authority (LTA)  has  been  able  to\r\n\r\nrecently  open  a new slip road from Tampines  Expressway\r\n\r\n(TPE)  eastbound to Punggol Road.  This is  part  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed  TPE/Sengkang  East  Road  Interchange  project,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  be fully completed by the end of this  year.\r\n\r\nLTA  has  progressively opened the various slip roads  at\r\n\r\nthis   interchange  to  allow  motorists  to  familiarise\r\n\r\nthemselves with the new traffic layouts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another project, the TPE/Sengkang East Drive\r\n\r\nFlyover, is also under construction, and it will  provide\r\n\r\na  new access link between Punggol and Sengkang New Towns\r\n\r\nby the end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These projects are proceeding on schedule. When\r\n\r\ncompleted,  they  would provide two important  additional\r\n\r\nroad accesses into Punggol Town, and help to relieve  the\r\n\r\ncurrent traffic congestion on Punggol Road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road network will receive a further boost in\r\n\r\n2007,  when  the  completion of  the  Kallang/Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nExpressway  will  provide  Punggol  Town  with  a  direct\r\n\r\nexpressway connection to the city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operator, the Public Transport Council (PTC) and\r\n\r\nLTA  will continue to obtain feedback from residents  and\r\n\r\nmonitor  the  quality  of public transport  services  and\r\n\r\ntraffic  conditions.  They will take appropriate measures\r\n\r\nto  improve  the situation where required.

For instance, the Government has spent over  $10\r\n\r\nbillion to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nput  in  place  the current MRT infrastructure.   Without\r\n\r\nsuch  subsidies, public transport fares would have to  be\r\n\r\nmuch higher than what they are today.  However, we do not\r\n\r\nsubsidise  the  day-to-day operation of public  transport\r\n\r\nservices.    This   is  to  instil  prudence,   financial\r\n\r\ndiscipline and efficiency in the operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With over one billion trips made on public transport\r\n\r\nevery  year,  it  would  cost taxpayers  more  than  $100\r\n\r\nmillion a year, if the Government were to subsidise fares\r\n\r\nby  a  mere  10 cents per trip.  This is not sustainable.\r\n\r\nBesides, not every commuter requires this subsidy.  It is\r\n\r\nbetter  that we directly help those who are in real  need\r\n\r\nthrough  the public assistance scheme and other community\r\n\r\nfinancial support programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, the Public Transport Council and the\r\n\r\ntransport  operators are all aware that public  transport\r\n\r\nfares  need  to  be kept affordable, particularly  during\r\n\r\ntough  times.   This is why there was no across-the-board\r\n\r\nfare  revision this year.  Also, arising from the  Public\r\n\r\nTransport  Council's efforts to moderate fares  over  the\r\n\r\nlast 16 years since the Council's formation, overall fare\r\n\r\nincreases   have   lagged   significantly   behind   wage\r\n\r\nincreases.  Over the 15-year period from 1987 to the  end\r\n\r\nof last year, fares for an 8 km trip on the bus increased\r\n\r\nby  14%  (from  90 cents to $1.03 cents) while  the  same\r\n\r\ndistance  trip  on the train increased by  30%  (from  80\r\n\r\ncents to $1.04 cents).  In comparison, wages increased by\r\n\r\nalmost 140% over the same period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that the Government will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  review  measures to help  companies  reduce\r\n\r\ntheir  overall costs.

This  is  the  best  way  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to help the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of support, yes, the Government is looking\r\n\r\ninto  ways  to provide additional support to the  people.\r\n\r\nAnd if Mr Chia is patient, he will get news of this later\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, does the Minister\r\n\r\nagree with me that looking from a group perspective,  the\r\n\r\ntransport companies  -  SBS Transit and SMRT  -   do  not\r\n\r\nneed the high fares on the NEL and the trains to survive,\r\n\r\nbut  that they do need high fares to continue to  produce\r\n\r\ngood profits for its shareholders?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I think any analyst looking\r\n\r\nat  the profits of the two transport operators will  tell\r\n\r\nus  that their profits are not astronomical.  In fact, if\r\n\r\nwe  look at their return on capital applied, we will find\r\n\r\nthat  the return on capital is actually not high at  all.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is very low.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> While there may be a low\r\n\r\nreturn on capital, would the Minister then agree with  me\r\n\r\nthat there is still profit?

I  want  to tell the Prime  Minister  that  he\r\n\r\nindeed  has amnesia.  In fact, the whole PAP is suffering\r\n\r\nfrom  serious amnesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last election, the PAP shouted the slogan,\r\n\r\n\"Support  the PAP for a secure future.\"  Yet, merely  two\r\n\r\nyears after the General Election, the PAP  has apparently\r\n\r\nforgotten its commitment to the people of Singapore.   It\r\n\r\nhas forgotten its promise to the people of Singapore that\r\n\r\nthey will continue to keep their jobs and continue to  be\r\n\r\nlooking  forward  to a good future.  While  the  PAP  has\r\n\r\nsuffered from amnesia, the hopes of 75% of the voters are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshattered.   They placed their trust on the PAP,  yet  in\r\n\r\nreturn  their income has been declining. Their rice  bowl\r\n\r\nis  still not secure.  Many workers are helpless  to  see\r\n\r\nthat  the Government is doing nothing to intervene,  even\r\n\r\nwhen those companies who are doing well are adopting \"pre-emptive\"  retrenchment measure.  Where  is  the  security\r\n\r\nthat  the PAP was talking about during the election,  can\r\n\r\nthey recall?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as late as this year's Budget debate, the\r\n\r\nGovernment still pledged in all sincerity and seriousness\r\n\r\nthat  the CPF contribution rate would be restored to 40%.\r\n\r\nYet,  merely  a  few months later, we are  faced  with  a\r\n\r\nfurther reduction in the CPF contribution rate.  What has\r\n\r\nhappened?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What puzzled me is that: Unexpectedly, the PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment is like the hare in the fable of \"The tortoise\r\n\r\nand  the  hare\".  Not knowing for how long  it  has  been\r\n\r\nsleeping,  it  suddenly wakes up to find that  the  whole\r\n\r\nworld  has changed - the tortoise has overtaken the hare.\r\n\r\nIt was as if only yesterday that the workers in Malaysia,\r\n\r\nChina  and  India were drawing salaries lower than  ours.\r\n\r\nOvernight,  we find our competitiveness lost.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nour  CPF  contribution and salaries have  to  be  slashed\r\n\r\nimmediately, otherwise we will not be able to retain  our\r\n\r\nrice-bowls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can choose not to tell the people\r\n\r\nwhen  it  woke up.  But it has the obligation to tell  us\r\n\r\nwhy  the  workers in the other countries are willing  and\r\n\r\nable to accept salaries lower than ours for the same job,\r\n\r\nbut we cannot.  Why is it that the premiums commanded  by\r\n\r\nour  workers as claimed by the Government all  along  can\r\n\r\ndisappear overnight?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government compares the Singapore workers'\r\n\r\nsalaries  to  the salaries of workers in other  countries\r\n\r\nand comes to the conclusion that our salaries are far too\r\n\r\nhigh and not competitive, therefore our salaries have  to\r\n\r\nbe  cut.  Why does the Government not compare Singapore's\r\n\r\ncost  of living to that of the other countries?  Why does\r\n\r\nit not compare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  Ministers' salaries to  the  salaries  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters in the other countries?  The Government  claims\r\n\r\nthat  it  costs much less to maintain the PAP  Government\r\n\r\nthan  it  costs  in the developed countries  to  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir  governments.  But, how  does  it  compare  to  the\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has boasted that every single public\r\n\r\nservice  it  provides  is aiming to  attain  world  class\r\n\r\nstandard, such as a world-class transport system,  world-class healthcare system, etc.  Of course, the charges are\r\n\r\nof  world-class  standard,  or  even  exceed  world-class\r\n\r\nstandard,   too!    Now   that   we   have    lost    our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  our workers have to  draw  salaries  of\r\n\r\nthird world level, yet the charges they have to pay  here\r\n\r\nare still of world-class standard.  Is this fair to them?\r\n\r\nTheir salaries were reduced again and again, yet for  365\r\n\r\ndays  in  a  year,  from cradle to grave, they and  their\r\n\r\nfamily  have  to  pay  the  ever  increasing   Goods  and\r\n\r\nServices Tax (GST). Do not tell me that this is the  kind\r\n\r\nof better future that the PAP has guaranteed!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government claims that there are jobs\r\n\r\naplenty  in the labour market.  It blames the people  for\r\n\r\nnot willing to take menial jobs, refusing to accept lower\r\n\r\nsalaries,  or  not willing to travel a long distance  for\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs.   Please do not put all  the  blame  on  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Has the PAP Government considered the burden  of\r\n\r\nthe  people?    Does it know what kind of an  income  the\r\n\r\nworkers must have to maintain a basic standard of  living\r\n\r\nin Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me talk about the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF system has been in existence before the PAP\r\n\r\nbecame  the  Government.  Its original objective  was  to\r\n\r\nensure that the workers would have some savings for their\r\n\r\nold  age  upon  retirement.   Then,  later  on,  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment expanded the functions of the CPF, linking  it\r\n\r\nup  with public services, such as housing and healthcare.\r\n\r\nAs  the  PAP  Government is one  that  is  very  firm  in\r\n\r\nresisting the idea of a welfare state, the CPF  has  thus\r\n\r\ntaken the role of a social safety net, provided by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  for themselves.  It has also become a key  pillar\r\n\r\nsupporting a world renowned public housing programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, changes that the PAP Government made to\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  system have some shortcomings, the most harmful\r\n\r\nof which is that the CPF system has become a tool for the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government to evaluate the purchasing power  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in setting the charges of public services.   They\r\n\r\nuse  the savings of the people in their CPF account as  a\r\n\r\nyardstick to determine the affordability of our people in\r\n\r\npaying for the public services.  The prices of HDB  flats\r\n\r\nkept going up when times were good because the Government\r\n\r\nsaid that the people had a lot of CPF and could therefore\r\n\r\nwell afford them.   When healthcare charges went up,  the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government said that the people have enough Medisave\r\n\r\nin their accounts, so the medical fees were \"affordable\".\r\n\r\nUniversity  fees went up because the PAP Government  said\r\n\r\nthat  the people could use their CPF savings to  pay  for\r\n\r\nthem, and they were again \"affordable\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system has also led to a wrong perception among\r\n\r\nthe  people.   They  thought that  the  CPF  was  like  a\r\n\r\nsecurity for their living and they could always  use  the\r\n\r\nCPF  for  their  housing and healthcare.   To  them,  CPF\r\n\r\nsaving  is  something  which  is  beyond  their  control,\r\n\r\nsomething which they can see yet cannot touch.  So,  even\r\n\r\nwith  the  charges going up, they are not  so  concerned,\r\n\r\nthis  eventually  turned  into a mentality  of  accepting\r\n\r\nevery increase without resistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long after, the CPF system was used by the\r\n\r\nGovernment as a tool for macro-economic control when  the\r\n\r\neconomy  is in recession.  Our CPF contribution rate,  at\r\n\r\none  time,  was  as high as 50%.  But when  there  was  a\r\n\r\nrecession, the Government began to change it.  So at this\r\n\r\ntime  when  the  people are having problems  making  ends\r\n\r\nmeet,  they  also  have to face the  impact  of  the  CPF\r\n\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that Singapore is faced with competition from\r\n\r\nthe other low cost countries, to a so-called far-sighted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment that claims to have created economic miracles,\r\n\r\nthis  challenge proves too arduous for their  creativity,\r\n\r\nthus  once again the CPF has become the sacrificial  lamb\r\n\r\nof the PAP Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any changes to the CPF policy would have far-reaching repercussion on the cost of living of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  people.  Their choices of housing,  healthcare\r\n\r\nservices,   retirement  plans  and  even  the  children's\r\n\r\nuniversity education were to a large extent dependent  on\r\n\r\nthe  amount of CPF they have in their account.  Once  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  resorts  to the use of  CPF  as  an  economic\r\n\r\nmanagement tool, a fluctuating CPF rate has become a trap\r\n\r\nto  many people, caught them off guard in their financial\r\n\r\nplanning at the time of change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, the Government wants the people to\r\n\r\nbe  responsible  for  their own  financial  planning  and\r\n\r\nretirement  plans; on the other hand, they  keep  raising\r\n\r\nthe  aspirations of the people and making use of the  CPF\r\n\r\nas  a  tool  in  managing the economy,  thus  introducing\r\n\r\nuncertainties in people's financial plan and  the  people\r\n\r\nare  perplexed .  For example, many people have  believed\r\n\r\nthe  PAP Government's propaganda for \"asset enhancement\".\r\n\r\nSo,  they spent all their CPF savings on the purchase  of\r\n\r\nproperties.   Now  that  the  CPF  contribution  rate  is\r\n\r\nreduced  all  of  a  sudden,  they  would  have  problems\r\n\r\nservicing  their loan and be locked in a predicament.  Is\r\n\r\nthis  the right way for a Government to treat its people?\r\n\r\nThose  who  have blind faith in the PAP's myth  of  asset\r\n\r\nenhancement are the biggest victims of these  changes  of\r\n\r\nCPF policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently the Government has run out of ideas in\r\n\r\ncoping with the current difficulties and has to resort to\r\n\r\ncutting the wages and CPF of our workers, time and again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with a new global economic landscape of\r\n\r\nintense  competition from developing economies, it  is  a\r\n\r\nwell known fact that our high land cost is the biggest\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nculprit contributing to our high business costs, but  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  seems  to be \"sparing the rats  to  save  the\r\n\r\ndishes\".  It dares not significantly bring down the  land\r\n\r\ncost  for fear that it would seriously affect the  assets\r\n\r\nof  the  people and they would have to pay a  very  heavy\r\n\r\npolitical price for that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, currency devaluation is another means\r\n\r\nthat  would create a significant and immediate effect  in\r\n\r\nbringing  down  our business cost, but the Government  is\r\n\r\nagain  not  prepared  to  do so  for  fear  of  political\r\n\r\nconsequences.   Taking  the  lesser  of  the   evils   in\r\n\r\nprotecting  their political interest, the PAP could  only\r\n\r\nchoose to cut our CPF.  However, from the perspective  of\r\n\r\nlong term interest of the nation and the people, what are\r\n\r\nthe  pros  and cons of such an option? But the point  is:\r\n\r\neven  when  the CPF is reduced to 30%, can you  guarantee\r\n\r\nthat it would be effective?  If it is not, what would  be\r\n\r\nthe  next  move?  Will it be a continuous  reduction?   I\r\n\r\nthink the Government should give us a clear indication so\r\n\r\nthat our people can be psychologically prepared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the actual situation now. Many\r\n\r\ncompanies  are  still  making profits  despite  the  poor\r\n\r\neconomy.   But  the Government is adopting a  one-for-all\r\n\r\nscheme whereby all the companies are entitled to a 3% cut\r\n\r\nin  the  CPF  contribution.  This hurts the  interest  of\r\n\r\nthose   employees   of  profit-making   companies.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment  urges these profitable companies to  pass  on\r\n\r\nthe  savings  to  the  workers in the  form  of  bonuses.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Singapore National Employers' Federation has\r\n\r\nclearly  indicated  that they do  not  encourage  such  a\r\n\r\npractice.   The  Government should clearly  indicate  its\r\n\r\nstand  in protecting the interest of our workers in  this\r\n\r\naspect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Government might even derive some\r\n\r\nfiscal  benefits from these changes too.  It  could  gain\r\n\r\nfrom  the savings from the CPF cut of the civil servants.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, companies may turn profitable or increase\r\n\r\ntheir  profit because of these CPF savings, in this case,\r\n\r\nthe Government will be able to collect\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  income  tax.    Is this not a  case  of  indirectly\r\n\r\ntransferring  the  cut  in the  people's  income  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's coffers?  What is the Government going to do\r\n\r\nwith  this income? Is the Government prepared to give  it\r\n\r\nback  to  our  people just like what they  encourage  the\r\n\r\ncompanies which are doing well to do so?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the CPF contribution rate, as early as 1994,\r\n\r\nafter  analysing the problem of the 1985  recession,  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party had stated very clearly in our  manifesto\r\n\r\nthat  the  CPF rate should be fixed at 35%, with employer\r\n\r\nand  employee  contributing half each.   Today,  I  still\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  35%  should be our long-term  target.   We\r\n\r\nshould not raise the CPF contribution rate above 35% when\r\n\r\nthe  economy is healthy, in order not to repeat all these\r\n\r\nproblems again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should use the 35% as a fixed\r\n\r\nassumption   in   analysing  our   business   costs   and\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  and  examine  the   effect   of   other\r\n\r\nvariables  such  as  the scale of the  Government,  other\r\n\r\ncosts  which are introduced by the regulatory control  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and land cost, etc,  and  cutting  them.\r\n\r\nTogether with restructuring the wage system and increased\r\n\r\nproductivity,    we   can  then  aim   to   enhance   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  By doing this, we can avoid  disturbing\r\n\r\nthe CPF and the financial planning of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, most people in Singapore are using\r\n\r\nalmost  all  of their CPF money to pay for their  housing\r\n\r\nloans and the increasing medical charges.  The balance in\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF  account is not enough to cater for their  old\r\n\r\nage needs. If we fix the CPF rate at 35%, it would have a\r\n\r\nbetter  basis  for  our people to plan  their  retirement\r\n\r\nplans,  and  strengthen our policy in  preparing  for  an\r\n\r\naging population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the older workers, the Workers' Party in its\r\n\r\nmanifesto  has stated that workers above 55 years  should\r\n\r\nbe  allowed to decide themselves whether to contribute to\r\n\r\nCPF.   In  this way, it would help them to have a  better\r\n\r\nchance of further employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, following the CPF cut, it is even\r\n\r\nmore important now to seek\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhigher  return  in  investing  the  money.   The  current\r\n\r\npractice  of lending the money to HDB so that  HDB  could\r\n\r\nlend  to  the  people, thereby earning  some  very  small\r\n\r\ninterest,  should  be revisited.  The  Government  should\r\n\r\nconsider  setting up a centralised CPF investment  agency\r\n\r\nto  look  into ways and means of  earning higher returns.\r\n\r\nWe  have yet to see any Government action in this aspect.\r\n\r\nThe  Government should make known their plan.  Of course,\r\n\r\nthere will be risks in any investment.  But we should let\r\n\r\nthe people choose among various investment plans, ranging\r\n\r\nfrom high risk high returns, to low risk low returns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it takes more than one cold day for\r\n\r\nthe river to freeze three feet deep.  The predicament  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans facing both the cuts in wages and CPF  of  a\r\n\r\nloss-loss  situation could have been  brewing  for  quite\r\n\r\nsome  time.  The problem could have rooted  way  back  in\r\n\r\n1986.   The PAP Government has all along been very  proud\r\n\r\nof     this    Government-employer-employee    tripartite\r\n\r\nestablishment.  It used to boast of the tripartite system\r\n\r\nbeing  a  triple win situation.  But as it turns out,  we\r\n\r\nall  know  that there is only a sole loser - the workers.\r\n\r\nThey  are  being sacrificed whenever there is an economic\r\n\r\nrecession.   Even though the Government is confident that\r\n\r\nour economy will recover, if it is a jobless recovery, if\r\n\r\nthe reduction in our business costs is still not able  to\r\n\r\nstop  companies from relocating, if the people are facing\r\n\r\nprolonged unemployment, should not the Government re-look\r\n\r\ninto  the  possibility of setting up some sort of  social\r\n\r\nsafety net?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP has been thinking of themselves too highly\r\n\r\nwhen  faced with an intense global competition.  The  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment has been saying all the time that Singapore is\r\n\r\nenjoying  a  premium of a good, effective  and  efficient\r\n\r\nGovernment, as well as our first class infrastructure, we\r\n\r\nare  far better than our competitors in many aspects  and\r\n\r\nare  holding many world's No. 1 trump cards. It is not  a\r\n\r\nproblem  in competing with other low cost economies  even\r\n\r\nthough  our costs are high.  When the people complain  of\r\n\r\nhigh  business  costs and high cost of  living,  the  PAP\r\n\r\nalways alleges that people are crying\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"wolf\".   Then,  all of a sudden, we find many  companies\r\n\r\nrelocating  to  other countries resulting  in  waves  and\r\n\r\nwaves   of  retrenchments,  we  see  the  major  shipping\r\n\r\ncompanies  moving to a Malaysian port.  Only then the PAP\r\n\r\nwoke  up,  panicked  and  started talking  about  cutting\r\n\r\nbusiness costs as a life and death matter.  But  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to cost cutting, it is the workers' salaries  that\r\n\r\nare  being  cut.   To  add more burden  to  our  workers,\r\n\r\ncharges in public services, utilities, transportation and\r\n\r\neducation  fees are increased at the time of salary  cut.\r\n\r\nPeople  are suffering, in so far as these are the results\r\n\r\nof an arrogant and headstrong Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the election, the PAP painted a rosy\r\n\r\npicture  and committed to restoring the CPF rate back  to\r\n\r\n40%,  they even put money in the people's pockets.   Once\r\n\r\nthe  election was over, they cannot wait any  further  to\r\n\r\ntake this money back through an immediate increase in the\r\n\r\nGST  rate.  Now they are asking the people to forget  the\r\n\r\nPAP's  promise  of  the restoration of  CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nrate,  in  a  light tone.  The PAP Government  has  acted\r\n\r\nperfidiously,  has broken faith with the people  and  let\r\n\r\ndown the people.  They should apologise to the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Industry (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  this  debate, Members have  raised  many  valid\r\n\r\nissues and concerns.  I would like to comment on some  of\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On entrepreneurship, like Members, I was\r\n\r\nconsiderably cheered by the Prime Minister  who  said  in\r\n\r\nhis  National  Day  Rally speech  that,  henceforth,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would set its default key  at  \"Yes\"  in  its\r\n\r\ndealings with business.  I met an analyst, shortly  after\r\n\r\nthe National Day Rally speech, and he asked me, \"What  is\r\n\r\nthe  \"big deal\", because several people had been involved\r\n\r\nin  the  entrepreneurship movement and held this position\r\n\r\nfor  quite some time.\"  But this is a \"big deal\"  because\r\n\r\nMr  Goh  Chok Tong is the Prime Minister.  And as we  all\r\n\r\nknow when the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister makes a pronouncement, it has a wonderful\r\n\r\neffect  of  concentrating  people's  minds  and  speeding\r\n\r\nthings up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Members will be happy to know that the winds of\r\n\r\nchange are already blowing.  It may not be as fast or  as\r\n\r\nhard  as some would like it but it is beginning to  shift\r\n\r\nold mindsets.  Increasingly, our regulators are taking  a\r\n\r\npro-enterprise approach in their dealings with  business.\r\n\r\nOne out of two suggestions received by the Pro-Enterprise\r\n\r\nPanel is accepted.  The Government takes cutting red tape\r\n\r\nso  seriously that it has now set up a dedicated  website\r\n\r\nto do this - www.cutredtape.gov.sg.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am optimistic about this entrepreneurship movement\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  embarking on.  This  is  because  societal\r\n\r\nattitudes  towards entrepreneurs are changing.  Recently,\r\n\r\nI  was  at the NTU's Technopreneurship Centre and  I  was\r\n\r\ntold  that  close  to  half of the 49  graduates  of  its\r\n\r\ninaugural  batch in the Technopreneurship and  Innovation\r\n\r\nProgramme  had  chosen to start up their own  businesses.\r\n\r\nMany  of these graduates had several job offers but  they\r\n\r\nchose the road less travelled.  So we are rekindling this\r\n\r\nspirit  of enterprise in our people.  These young  people\r\n\r\nfrom  NTU  give  us  hope  for the  future  as  they  are\r\n\r\npractising, what I call, the Nike strategy towards  life:\r\n\r\n\"Just do it.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have also argued that to keep costs\r\n\r\ncompetitive,  it  should not be confined  to  wage  costs\r\n\r\nalone.   I fully agree.  It stands to reason that  if  we\r\n\r\nask  Singaporeans to take a cut in their CPF contribution\r\n\r\nrates, that they have a right to expect that other  costs\r\n\r\nwould be kept down too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has been doing and will continue to\r\n\r\ndo  its part.  We are getting rid of unnecessary licences\r\n\r\nand  rules,  putting them on-line and reducing Government\r\n\r\nfees  and  charges  as a matter of  priority.   URA,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, recently announced significantly lower  charges\r\n\r\nfor  businesses that wish to change their trades or alter\r\n\r\ntheir premises.  The Registry of Companies and Businesses\r\n\r\nhas reduced business registration fees by half.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd  HDB  now  allows entrepreneurs  to  start  up  small\r\n\r\nbusinesses in their own homes, thereby reducing  start-up\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these ongoing efforts, the Government is\r\n\r\nseeking to keep industrial rents competitive through  its\r\n\r\nindustrial    land   sales   programme.    For    greater\r\n\r\nflexibility, JTC introduced shorter-tenure land  in  2002\r\n\r\nto  lower start-up costs.  JTC also allows the conversion\r\n\r\nof  existing fixed rate leases to floating rates with  an\r\n\r\nescalation  cap  to moderate business costs  and  provide\r\n\r\nmore certainty to business planning.  Since 2001, JTC has\r\n\r\noffered  rebates of up to 20%, amounting  to  savings  of\r\n\r\n$1.1 billion for some 7,000 companies until December this\r\n\r\nyear.   JTC  also conducts regular reviews of  industrial\r\n\r\nrentals  and  prices  to  ensure  that  they  match   the\r\n\r\nprevailing market conditions.  The two reviews in January\r\n\r\nand  July this year have resulted in an average reduction\r\n\r\nof  4%  for land rentals and 11% for ready-built rentals.\r\n\r\nFor the industrial property market as a whole, prices  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  space  have slid about 25%  since  2001,  and\r\n\r\nrentals    of    industrial   facilities   have    fallen\r\n\r\napproximately  13% over the same period.  Going  forward,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will also be looking into  international\r\n\r\nbenchmarking   to  ensure  that  industrial   rents   are\r\n\r\ncompetitive against alternative locations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I agree with Members that we have to keep\r\n\r\nreviewing  Government  services, keep  looking  for  more\r\n\r\nefficient ways of doing things so as to reduce costs, and\r\n\r\ntrim  charges  wherever it is possible  to  do  so  while\r\n\r\nrecovering costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we should not do is for the Government to\r\n\r\ncome  in and subsidise certain public consumption  items,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  utilities.   I have no doubts  whatsoever  that\r\n\r\nthere  are people with genuine problems paying for  their\r\n\r\nutilities because they have been retrenched or  for  some\r\n\r\nother  reasons.  I meet them every week at  my  Meet-the-People  sessions.  But the way to help them is by  direct\r\n\r\nfinancial   assistance  rather  than   to   provide   for\r\n\r\nsubsidised utility supplies for all consumers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do that, our utility companies cannot recover\r\n\r\ncosts and will not make\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnew  investments in the system.  Without new  investments\r\n\r\nto match new demand, we run major risks of having to take\r\n\r\nturns to have our electricity blacked out.  This, indeed,\r\n\r\nhas  been  the experience of countries that subsidise  in\r\n\r\none   way   or   another   to  keep  electricity   prices\r\n\r\nartificially low.  In 2001, the price caps in  California\r\n\r\nthat  forced  their utility companies to sell  at  a  low\r\n\r\nprice  to  consumers  brought  the  companies  there   to\r\n\r\nbankruptcies.   Consequently,  there  were  blackouts  in\r\n\r\nCalifornia  until prices rose to prevent the lights  from\r\n\r\ngoing  off indefinitely.  In short, Californians suffered\r\n\r\nboth  blackouts  and  higher  prices.   No  jurisdiction,\r\n\r\nincluding Singapore, is immune to this if we distort  the\r\n\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that, in times of economic stress, there is a\r\n\r\ngreat  temptation to say that just this once, we make  an\r\n\r\nexception  to the principle that we will not distort  the\r\n\r\nconsumption of utilities.  But you know a principle  once\r\n\r\nbreached is often impossible to resurrect.  If we go  for\r\n\r\nshort-term  palliative, we would end up with a  long-term\r\n\r\nheadache.  So we should stick to our approach of  helping\r\n\r\npeople  in  need  by  subsidising the  users  directly  - through utilities rebate and direct financial assistance,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme (RUAS),\r\n\r\nrather  than  subsidising  the service  or  product  they\r\n\r\nconsume.   This ensures that the overall public  interest\r\n\r\nis  safeguarded by a competitive utilities market and  at\r\n\r\nthe same time caters to those in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this leads me to my next point that\r\n\r\nwe  need to constantly review how best we can help  those\r\n\r\ndisplaced   by  economic  restructuring   to   make   the\r\n\r\ntransition successful.  This is so because whilst  it  is\r\n\r\ntrue  that labour markets work best when they are allowed\r\n\r\nto  behave  just like any other market, there is  a  huge\r\n\r\ndifference  in  human terms.  An unsold  commodity  is  a\r\n\r\nnuisance and an unemployed worker is a tragedy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all the more so as we are now living in a\r\n\r\ndifferent world.  Globalisation has compressed space  and\r\n\r\naccelerated time.  It has become one world, whether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  are  ready  or not.  Some Members, for instance,  are\r\n\r\nquite right to point out that the issue is not just about\r\n\r\ncosts  alone.   After all, China and India,  for  a  long\r\n\r\ntime, have much lower costs than us.  But they were not a\r\n\r\ncompetitive  challenge then.  What has  changed  is  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  now  opening  up, part  of  WTO  and  in  this\r\n\r\nglobalised world, they are competing with everyone  else,\r\n\r\nincluding  Singapore,  for  the  consumer  and   investor\r\n\r\ndollar.   So, our costs cannot be seriously out  of  line\r\n\r\nwith our competitors or we will simply be bypassed.   But\r\n\r\nwhat is going to give us the sustainable edge must be the\r\n\r\nquality  of our people.  This is why we invest so heavily\r\n\r\nin education and continual skills upgrading.  Despite the\r\n\r\neconomic slowdown, education accounted for almost 22%  of\r\n\r\nour  total public expenditure in FY 2003 as against about\r\n\r\n12.7%,  on  average,  in the OECD  countries.   The  OECD\r\n\r\nfigures  are 1999 figures, the latest I could find.   The\r\n\r\nSkills Development Fund has increased from $88 million to\r\n\r\n$115  million in the last five years.  In an age of rapid\r\n\r\ntechnological  changes and porous borders,  job  security\r\n\r\ncomes  not  from putting up the shutters and bolting  the\r\n\r\ndoors  from  the world, but from picking  up  new  skills\r\n\r\nthrough  lifelong learning.  So Mr Low is wrong  when  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that the Government has been asleep all this while,\r\n\r\nas  the  Government has been saying this all  along.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  many of you would have heard this before, even  ad\r\n\r\nnauseam, but I make no apologies for this, as it  is  the\r\n\r\nhonest truth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our job is not to shield workers from this reality\r\n\r\nbut  to  empower them to deal with it and to assure  them\r\n\r\nthat  they do not have to fight this battle on their own.\r\n\r\nWe  are  a community and not a collection of individuals.\r\n\r\nAnd  just as we share our prosperity in good times -  CPF\r\n\r\nTop-ups, New Singapore Shares and more HDB upgrading - so\r\n\r\ntoo  must  we  collectively help shoulder the  burden  of\r\n\r\nadjustment of those dislocated during tough times.  Thus,\r\n\r\nthe   Manpower   Ministry,  the  National  Trades   Union\r\n\r\nCongress, the Community Development Councils and  various\r\n\r\nother organisations are making\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommon  cause with those affected to help them make  this\r\n\r\ntransition.   And  we stand open and  ready  to  consider\r\n\r\nviews  from all who proffer them, such as that by Straits\r\n\r\nTimes'  columnist,  Chua Mui Hoong, who  argued  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  look at revising our workers' assistance  schemes\r\n\r\nto an employee- rather than an employer-based one.  It is\r\n\r\na valid point.  We have taken some steps here by allowing\r\n\r\nthe  jobless  to  benefit from subsidised training  under\r\n\r\nvarious schemes.  And we will do more as we shift from  a\r\n\r\nworld  where workers seek security in lifetime employment\r\n\r\nto   that   of  lifelong  employability.   The  Workforce\r\n\r\nDevelopment Agency and the Home Ownership Plus  Education\r\n\r\nprogramme  (HOPE)  are  the latest  initiatives  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, even as we focus on the big picture - to\r\n\r\ngenerate   growth   by   embracing   globalisation    and\r\n\r\nliberalisation - it is vital that we pay heed to  develop\r\n\r\nequally  effective adjustment measures to facilitate  the\r\n\r\ntransition and cushion the worst of its effects for those\r\n\r\ndisplaced.  For whilst the benefits of globalisation  are\r\n\r\noften  long term in nature, its adverse effects  on those\r\n\r\ndisplaced   are  immediate.   And  unless  we   do   this\r\n\r\neffectively,  we  would not have the  national  consensus\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  successfully  see  through  this  economic\r\n\r\ntransformation.  That is the challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have every confidence that Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nrise to the occasion.  Already, initial business feedback\r\n\r\nis positive because they see us as united, responsive and\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  the need to be competitive.  Bob  Johnson,\r\n\r\nthe  President and CEO of Honeywell Aerospace, which  has\r\n\r\njust announced its decision to set up a key international\r\n\r\nprocurement  office  in  Singapore,  had  this  to   say:\r\n\r\n\"Singapore's highly skilled workforce, strategic location\r\n\r\nand world-class infrastructure are compelling reasons for\r\n\r\nHoneywell  to  have  a significant  presence  here.\"   He\r\n\r\nbelieves   that  the  measures  taken  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment to help companies operating in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nbenefit them in the long term.  Wong Ngit Liong, Managing\r\n\r\nDirector  of Venture Corporation Limited feels  that  the\r\n\r\nCPF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreduction,  coupled  with continued  efforts  to  improve\r\n\r\ncapabilities and skills, would give a boost to attracting\r\n\r\nmore businesses and investments to Singapore.  So we  are\r\n\r\non  the  right  track.  If we work together  as  we  have\r\n\r\nalways done before, then Singapore will continue to  hold\r\n\r\nits  own  in the First World.  And we would have built  a\r\n\r\nbetter future for ourselves and our children.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  Mr  Low Thia Khiang  said  that  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  having amnesia. I think the  one  who  is\r\n\r\nsuffering from amnesia is not the Government, but Mr  Low\r\n\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 38 years, the PAP Government has\r\n\r\ntransformed  Singapore from a third world  country  to  a\r\n\r\nfirst  world  country.   The  PAP  Government  has    not\r\n\r\nforgotten  its commitments to the people.   What  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing  now,  such  as  this debate on  CPF  retuning,  is\r\n\r\nprecisely because the  PAP Government knows the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  people.  It  is  taking these  painful  measures  to\r\n\r\nprotect  their  jobs, and even to create  more  jobs  for\r\n\r\nthem.  Therefore, Mr Low should go to seek medical advice\r\n\r\nabout his amnesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wage reform is one of the important links in the\r\n\r\nendeavour to  reduce business costs.  Prime Minister  Goh\r\n\r\nhas announced the reduction in CPF rates and the lowering\r\n\r\nof  salary ceiling for CPF contribution. This is a  clear\r\n\r\nsignal to the market that the Government is committed  to\r\n\r\nreforming  our economy and implementing wage  reform.   I\r\n\r\nfully support the Government in this endeavour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise some observations on the CPF\r\n\r\nretuning exercise.  I hope the Government can determine a\r\n\r\nclear  and specific CPF contribution rate, rather than  a\r\n\r\nrange of rates.  This is good for workers as well as  for\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Business people would like to have  certainty\r\n\r\nand  stability.  If the Government does not have a  fixed\r\n\r\nrate,  be  it 30% or 36%, they would wonder: \"When  would\r\n\r\nthe  Government be raising the CPF rate again?\"  To  play\r\n\r\nsafe, the business would budget and plan,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbased  on the assumption that the CPF rate would  be  the\r\n\r\nupper end of the range.  This would defeat the purpose of\r\n\r\nour CPF cut exercise.  If this is not certain, the would-be  investors  may fear that the employer's  contribution\r\n\r\nrate  may  move back to 36% or even higher, and therefore\r\n\r\nput away their intention to invest here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that a cut in CPF rate is never a good\r\n\r\nmechanism  in the  lowering of wage cost.  The Government\r\n\r\nshould  not  make use of CPF as a means of  intervention.\r\n\r\nBusinessmen  and  the market should have  the   means  to\r\n\r\nadjust their wage level.  The Government should not micromanage  the  wage system.  The CPF is a long-term  safety\r\n\r\nnet for the people.  Therefore, there should be stability\r\n\r\nand  certainty in a long-term objective. In this way, CPF\r\n\r\nmembers will be better able to plan for their retirement,\r\n\r\ntheir choice of housing and healthcare needs.  There is a\r\n\r\nsaying that managing a state is like frying a fish  in  a\r\n\r\nwok.  If we try to stir-fry the fish in the wok, then  it\r\n\r\nwould  turn  out to be awful-looking and not presentable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I hope the Government will set a specific long-term rate for CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should make use of this opportunity to take\r\n\r\nproactive  measures to promote the flexi-wage system,  so\r\n\r\nthat businessmen can adjust their wage cost according  to\r\n\r\nthe  market  situation in a more sensitive and responsive\r\n\r\nmanner.   The rate has been lowered by 3%, and this  will\r\n\r\nresult   in  total  savings  of  $1.3  billion  for   the\r\n\r\nemployers.  Maybe some of them do not need these savings.\r\n\r\nThe  Government should encourage, or even by legislation,\r\n\r\ncompanies  which are doing well to make use  of  this  3%\r\n\r\nsaving  to  reward  the employees by way  of  performance\r\n\r\nbonus.   On this basis, the companies can increase  their\r\n\r\nMVC  component  to  reward their employees  according  to\r\n\r\ntheir performance.  In this way, we will be able to allow\r\n\r\nemployers  to use this flexi-wage system to  obviate  the\r\n\r\nneed to revise the CPF rate again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the salary ceiling for CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution,  there seems to be a lack  of  flexibility.\r\n\r\nEvery  retiree  has different needs,  and  we  have  been\r\n\r\nencouraging\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  to  depend less on the Government.   Can  we  not\r\n\r\nallow  them greater autonomy in managing their  financial\r\n\r\naffairs?   A  retiree  may have very  low  income  before\r\n\r\nretirement, and to ask that he should have $120,000 as  a\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum in the CPF, I think, is too drastic.   While\r\n\r\nothers may have other retirement benefits, do we want  to\r\n\r\nforce  them  to leave behind such a high Minimum  Sum  of\r\n\r\n$120,000?   Therefore, I think the amount of Minimum  Sum\r\n\r\nshould  be  determined  by the last-drawn  salary  before\r\n\r\nretirement   and  whether  there  are  other   retirement\r\n\r\nbenefits, such as pension.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, with the lowering of CPF rate, our people's\r\n\r\nsavings  in the CPF will be less.  I would like  to  make\r\n\r\ntwo  suggestions on how to increase their savings in  the\r\n\r\nCPF.   Firstly,  we should raise the rate  of  return  on\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF.  Secondly, extend their retirement  age.   At\r\n\r\npresent,  the rate for CPF is 2.5%.  This is  similar  to\r\n\r\nthe rate for treasury bonds.  I think this is too low for\r\n\r\nany  retirement  plan.   The CPF Board  should  help  its\r\n\r\nmembers earn a higher rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give some examples. For a member who has\r\n\r\nworked  for  37  years, ie, from age 25 to  62,  and  the\r\n\r\naverage  contribution per year is $6,000, if the rate  is\r\n\r\n2.5%, the return will be $358,000 after 37 years.  If the\r\n\r\nrate is 3%, he will be getting $397,000.  If the rate  is\r\n\r\n5%,  he  will be getting $610,000, which is almost double\r\n\r\nwhat is being given now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the total amount of CPF is concerned, the\r\n\r\nmembers'  total  savings in the CPF as of  December  last\r\n\r\nyear, amounted to $96 billion.  If we can raise by 1%  on\r\n\r\nthe  rate of return, we will be able to get $960  million\r\n\r\nfor  them, which compensates almost as much as  the  $1.3\r\n\r\nbillion  cut  in CPF contributions.  Therefore,  I  agree\r\n\r\nfully with the Deputy Speaker, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, that the\r\n\r\nfunds should be managed by qualified fund managers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is that we should remove the\r\n\r\npresent retirement age\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  workers.  As long as they are healthy, they should be\r\n\r\nallowed  to work, so as to ensure that they are  healthy,\r\n\r\nmentally  and physically.  The lifespan of our people  is\r\n\r\n80  years.  The  Prime Minister said that they  are  even\r\n\r\nlikely to live to 100.  The present legal retirement  age\r\n\r\nof  62  years  will mean that they still  have  at  least\r\n\r\nanother 20 years after retirement.  We should allow  them\r\n\r\nto  continue  working.  Many jobs do  not  need  physical\r\n\r\nstrength.  Age is no longer a hindrance to work.  In this\r\n\r\nway,  they  will  need less resources  after  retirement.\r\n\r\nThey  will  continue  to contribute to  the  society  and\r\n\r\ndepend less on the State.  This will lessen the financial\r\n\r\nburden  on  the  society  and  our  reliance  on  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me focus on the short-term impact. There was a\r\n\r\nLianhe  Zaobao  reader [Huang Shan Chang] who  said  that\r\n\r\nclothing, food, housing, transport and healthcare are our\r\n\r\ndaily  necessities. How do we tighten our belts  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  these needs?  The former two should depend  on  the\r\n\r\nindividual,  but  the latter three  will  depend  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We should work with the Government  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith the new situation.  It is inevitable that there will\r\n\r\nbe  lower  wages and lower CPF contributions.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nour  people should make the necessary adjustments.  There\r\n\r\nis  a saying in Cantonese: \"Eat according to the food  on\r\n\r\nthe table.\"  We have to look at the amount of food on the\r\n\r\ntable  to see how much we can eat, so that there will  be\r\n\r\nenough to go round. Therefore, we, the people, should  be\r\n\r\nflexible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was young, there was a time when\r\n\r\nmy  father  lost his job. He had to work  as  an  odd-job\r\n\r\nworker and as a hawker to support the family. We switched\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Thai  fragrant rice to the cheaper  rice  from\r\n\r\nChina.  When we ran out of even the Chinese rice, we  had\r\n\r\nto contend with broken rice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand that when the people are making\r\n\r\nsuch adjustments, they hope that the Government will also\r\n\r\ntake corresponding measures.  They hope that the savings,\r\n\r\nas  a result of the lowering of CPF and wages, should  be\r\n\r\nused to help the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople,  to  lower education charges, transport  charges,\r\n\r\nroad  tax,  petrol  and diesel tax.  Transport  companies\r\n\r\nshould also pass on such savings to the commuters.   Cost\r\n\r\nof housing, rentals and property tax should be lowered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said \"no fish, prawns also can\".\r\n\r\nIf  we  are  determined to reform our  economy  to  lower\r\n\r\nbusiness cost and to reform our wage system, we should be\r\n\r\nable  to raise our competitiveness in the global economy,\r\n\r\nand attract more investors here to create more and better\r\n\r\njobs  for  our  people.  By then, we will not  only  have\r\n\r\nordinary prawns, but tiger prawns or even lobsters!   And\r\n\r\nwe can then say, \"No fish, we will go for good prawns.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Boon Heng (Minister, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</b> Sir, the CPF changes are fundamental and have\r\n\r\nlong-term   impact  and  benefits.   They  affect   every\r\n\r\nemployee, which means almost everybody in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, trade unions have been bearing the heaviest\r\n\r\nduty of explaining the changes to the ground.  After  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister's National Day Rally speech, 38 of our  64\r\n\r\nunions have held discussions by yesterday.  My colleagues\r\n\r\nfrom  the  unions have mentioned the ground  feedback  in\r\n\r\nParliament  yesterday, and more will do so.  I  will  not\r\n\r\nrepeat  what  they  say.   Rather,  I  will  address  the\r\n\r\nquestion whether our wages are out of line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short term, two groups of people would appear\r\n\r\nto  feel  the impact more.  They would say they  are  hit\r\n\r\nharder.   One group are the employees in the 50-55  years\r\n\r\nage  group.   The other are the middle-income  employees.\r\n\r\nYet  the  changes  are  aimed at helping  them.   Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have watched retrenchments carefully over 22\r\n\r\nyears.   My  conclusion is that older  workers  are  more\r\n\r\nvulnerable to retrenchments.  They take longer to find  a\r\n\r\nnew  job.   When they do, they took substantial  cuts  in\r\n\r\npay.   Data  from the Ministry of Manpower clearly  shows\r\n\r\nthis.  I have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nasked  the  Clerk of Parliament to circulate some  tables\r\n\r\nand charts, which I believe Members now have before them.\r\n\r\n[Copies   of  tables  and  charts  distributed  to   hon.\r\n\r\nMembers.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Labour Force Survey of June 2002, those in\r\n\r\nthe  50-59  years  age  group have the  highest  rate  of\r\n\r\nretrenchment at about 29 per 1,000.  They took almost  22\r\n\r\nweeks to find a new job, and three-quarters of them  took\r\n\r\npay cuts.  The charts clearly show that this group is the\r\n\r\nhardest hit of all the groups that suffered retrenchment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years, manufacturing has borne the\r\n\r\nbrunt  of  retrenchments. The restructuring is still  on-going  and it will continue in the future in any  dynamic\r\n\r\neconomy.     We   become   uncompetitive   in   lower-end\r\n\r\nmanufacturing and these are relocated.  But the  pace  of\r\n\r\nrelocation  has  gone up.  Until recently,  most  of  the\r\n\r\nrelocations  were  to neighbouring countries,  especially\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the data obtained from unionised companies, in\r\n\r\n1999,  out of 7,635 jobs lost, 21% or 1,636 were  due  to\r\n\r\nrelocation.  This is taken purely from our unions.  36 of\r\n\r\nthese jobs went to China, but 1,392 went to Malaysia.  So\r\n\r\nin   1999,  when  companies  relocated,  they   went   to\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries, particularly Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture changed dramatically in 2002. Job\r\n\r\nlosses due to relocation rose to 30%, from 21% up to 30%.\r\n\r\nOut  of 2,343 jobs lost due to relocation, 1,060 went  to\r\n\r\nChina and only 221 to Malaysia.  Therefore, the preferred\r\n\r\nlocation  now  is  China because of the more  competitive\r\n\r\noperating  environment there due to lower wage costs  and\r\n\r\nlower land costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, retrenchments in services have\r\n\r\nrisen.  This  is  most marked in the  financial  services\r\n\r\nsector.    Jobs   were  lost  because  of   mergers   and\r\n\r\nacquisitions,  deletion  of  jobs  through  the  use   of\r\n\r\ntechnology, and outsourcing of work to cheaper locations.\r\n\r\nThe  mergers  arose from consolidation of  our  banks  in\r\n\r\npreparation  for  the  liberalisation  of  the  financial\r\n\r\nservices\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsector because of global multi-lateral discussions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there has also been a significant increase\r\n\r\nin  retrenchment  of professional, managerial,  executive\r\n\r\nand  technical  staff.  About 20% of those retrenched  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  five years are diploma or degree holders.  The\r\n\r\nproportion   is  much  higher  in  recent  quarters,   as\r\n\r\nhighlighted by the Prime Minister yesterday, as  much  as\r\n\r\n43%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we make of these separate pieces of\r\n\r\ninformation?  Are our wages too high?  Our GDP per capita\r\n\r\nmatches those of developed countries, indicating that our\r\n\r\nwage  levels  are at or near their levels.  I  have  also\r\n\r\ncirculated  a  chart on the per capita GDP  of  different\r\n\r\ncountries.   You would see from the chart  that  we  rank\r\n\r\namong the developed countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our wage costs in manufacturing are not high\r\n\r\ncompared  to the United States and Australia.   According\r\n\r\nto the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2003, the total\r\n\r\nhourly compensation for manufacturing workers is US$20.32\r\n\r\nfor  the  US  and US$13.82 for Australia.  Ours  is  only\r\n\r\nUS$7.78.  So for manufacturing, our wage costs are  lower\r\n\r\nthan United States and Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the US and Australia do different kinds of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing.  They are of higher value added.  Much  of\r\n\r\nour  manufacturing work is lower value added compared  to\r\n\r\ntheirs.  Because of their own high cost environment, they\r\n\r\nshifted  these  factories  to other  countries  that  are\r\n\r\ncheaper,  including  Singapore, and we  have  been  doing\r\n\r\nthose.  But just as we do lower value added manufacturing\r\n\r\nactivities   compared  to  US,  so  do  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries, those that are lower value added, compared  to\r\n\r\nours, because their wage costs are lower. For example, in\r\n\r\nMalaysia, the hourly rate is US$2.78 and in China, it  is\r\n\r\nUS$0.59.   But  one  thing that has happened,  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears,  is that our neighbours have been catching  up  on\r\n\r\nskills and ability and,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntherefore,  they attract lower value added  manufacturing\r\n\r\nfrom us far more quickly.  They can do it efficiently and\r\n\r\nat  lower  cost.   Hence,  the  relocations.   We  cannot\r\n\r\ncompete  with Malaysia or China in lower wage costs,  nor\r\n\r\ndo  we  wish to.  We do not want to earn those  kinds  of\r\n\r\nwages.   But  we  do have workers now in  relatively  low\r\n\r\nvalue  added  manufacturing  jobs.   If  these  factories\r\n\r\nrelocate,  what would our workers do? They are our  older\r\n\r\nworkers.   There are two ways.  One, move up the  ladder.\r\n\r\nTwo,  move sideways into another job.  The CPF  cut  will\r\n\r\nkeep  the factories here a little longer, giving us  more\r\n\r\ntime to adjust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we move up to higher value added activities, we\r\n\r\nneed  more  skilled  workers.   You  take,  for  example,\r\n\r\nPhilips.   Philips used to employ thousands of production\r\n\r\nworkers  in  Toa  Payoh.   Today, Philips  still  employs\r\n\r\nthousands,  but  the  production workers  are  mostly  in\r\n\r\nBatam.  At Toa Payoh, the majority are engineers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can our workers retrenched from the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector be converted to engineers?  The sad truth is,  no,\r\n\r\nmost  of  them  cannot.   So we buy  some  time,  through\r\n\r\ntrimming  our  wage costs, and all other costs.   And  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  retrain  them  for other  jobs.   That  is  why\r\n\r\nretraining is so important.  As my colleague, Mr  Raymond\r\n\r\nLim,  said  earlier, this is something that we have  been\r\n\r\nstressing  on year after year, and have been  doing  more\r\n\r\nand  more each year.  So far from being asleep,  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  very  much  awake, alive to the  dangers  that  our\r\n\r\nworkers  face.  Many of the jobs that retrenched  workers\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  take  will  be those  that  are  occupied\r\n\r\ncurrently  by foreign workers.  I hope that  our  workers\r\n\r\nwill  consider  them.   Other jobs  will  come  from  new\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  investments, because  one-third  of  those\r\n\r\njobs require lower skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in order to match those looking for work and\r\n\r\nemployers looking for workers, we have to bridge a gap of\r\n\r\nexpectations.   On  the  one hand, workers  have  certain\r\n\r\nexpectations of wages.  They also have family needs  that\r\n\r\nhave to be taken into account.  On the other hand, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployers expect workers to fit into production patterns.\r\n\r\nI  think that the gap really is in these specific  areas.\r\n\r\nSo,  we have to make a special effort to bridge this gap.\r\n\r\nThe  NTUC and the Ministry of Manpower are doing  so.   I\r\n\r\nwould  urge Members of this House, if they can play their\r\n\r\npart  to  match these retrenched workers into jobs,  they\r\n\r\nwould be doing them a far greater service than by arguing\r\n\r\nagainst any cuts or adjustments in CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we move up in manufacturing, we compete against\r\n\r\nthe  developed  countries.  How  does  the  cost  of  our\r\n\r\nengineers   here  compare  with  engineers  in  developed\r\n\r\ncountries?   According  to the IMD World  Competitiveness\r\n\r\nYearbook  2003, annual wages of our engineers are  higher\r\n\r\nthan  many developed countries.  Let me cite just a  few:\r\n\r\nSingapore,   US$80,000;  Australia,  US$55,000;   France,\r\n\r\nUS$77,000;   Netherlands,  US$67,000;   United   Kingdom,\r\n\r\nUS$75,000;  and  United  States,  US$92,000.    Ours   is\r\n\r\nUS$80,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the wages of our engineers are higher than most\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries.  Not only are they well within  the\r\n\r\ntop  20%  of wage earners in Singapore, they are  drawing\r\n\r\nfirst  world wages.  I think it would take some time  for\r\n\r\npeople to absorb this fact because many people, including\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament, were wondering whether  the  80th\r\n\r\npercentile  wage  in  Singapore of $3,700  per  month  is\r\n\r\ncorrect.   Those  who asked me, I referred  them  to  the\r\n\r\nCPF's  annual  report. They made their  calculations  and\r\n\r\nthey  found  that the Prime Minister's figure was  indeed\r\n\r\ncorrect, and that many people who thought themselves poor\r\n\r\nbelonged   to   the   top  20%  of  Singaporeans.    Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  who can relate to these  wages,  will  now\r\n\r\nknow  that they are not earning third world wages -  they\r\n\r\nare earning first world wages!  Today, with this kind  of\r\n\r\nwages,  we have to compete with the first world, as  well\r\n\r\nas the third world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the message here is: we have to attract higher\r\n\r\nvalue added activities here.  To do that, we will need to\r\n\r\ndo  many other things, and there must be more reasons for\r\n\r\nthem to find it worth their while to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvest here in Singapore.  But, at the same time, we have\r\n\r\nto  recognise that our wages cannot be so out of line and\r\n\r\nthat  is why if the CPF changes appear to fall harder  on\r\n\r\nthe higher middle income, this is one good reason why  it\r\n\r\nshould  be so, because we cannot price ourselves  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  world  market.  I do not know how the PERC  obtained\r\n\r\nits  figures.  But looking at the data that was  provided\r\n\r\nby  the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2003, I think,\r\n\r\nperhaps, PERC was looking at the types of activities that\r\n\r\nthey think Singapore is most suited for, and where do  we\r\n\r\nstand  in  global  competition to attract  them  here  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to services. This sector has been\r\n\r\ngrowing  faster  than  manufacturing.   But  we  have  to\r\n\r\ncontend with at least two factors - competition from  the\r\n\r\nregion and competition from developed countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that back-end work will\r\n\r\nincreasingly be outsourced.  Let me cite an example.   On\r\n\r\n17th  December  2002, Neptune Orient Lines  announced  an\r\n\r\neight-year contract with Accenture Consulting.  Accenture\r\n\r\nConsulting  would take over responsibility  for  the  NOL\r\n\r\nGroup's   accounts  payable,  accounts   receivable   and\r\n\r\naccounts  reconciliation  processes.   Accenture  has   a\r\n\r\nsizeable   practice   in  Singapore.    Now   comes   the\r\n\r\ninteresting part.  What they would do for NOL  would  not\r\n\r\nbe done in Singapore, but in Shanghai.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for lower level work in services, we cannot\r\n\r\ncompete with China, India or the Philippines.  So we have\r\n\r\nto  go up to higher value added services.  It means  that\r\n\r\nwe  will  have to do the kind of services that  developed\r\n\r\ncountries  do.  Here,  our wage  levels  are  similar  to\r\n\r\nAustralia,  New Zealand and Ireland.  I am talking  about\r\n\r\nwages   in   services.   The  IMD  World  Competitiveness\r\n\r\nYearbook 2003 shows that the annual wages of a department\r\n\r\nmanager are $37,100 for Singapore, $38,600 for Australia,\r\n\r\n$34,200  for  New Zealand, and $44,900 for Ireland.   All\r\n\r\nthese,  again, in US dollars.  So, our wage level  for  a\r\n\r\ndepartment manager is of a similar level as some of these\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those in the US at US$69,000 and the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nat US$47,000, they earn more.  But our productivity level\r\n\r\nin services is significantly lower.  Our productivity per\r\n\r\nperson  in  services is only US$36,100.  It is comparable\r\n\r\nto  those of Australia at about US$39,300, but it is much\r\n\r\nlower  than the United States at US$73,900 or the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom at US$50,300.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, clearly, if we hope to grow the services sector,\r\n\r\nwe will have to improve our productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many factors in productivity, but the key\r\n\r\nfactor  is a higher volume of business.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  look at the revenue part of  the  equation.\r\n\r\nThat   is   what  the  economic  strategy  of  Government\r\n\r\naddresses.  There is a lot more outlined in the  Economic\r\n\r\nReview Committee's recommendations that many commentators\r\n\r\nhave  given  credit for.  It is now for the employers  to\r\n\r\nshow  that they are doing their part.  As Heng  Chee  How\r\n\r\nsaid  yesterday, employers have a lot to do, and  workers\r\n\r\nwant  to  see  them  doing it.  They  want  to  see,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the Singapore Business Federation and  business\r\n\r\nChambers going out to get business, and bringing in  more\r\n\r\ninvestments.  As Raymond Lim says, there are some signals\r\n\r\nthat  what  the  CPF changes are meant for  are  working.\r\n\r\nBecause  some  companies  say  that  they  will  stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, some companies say that they will expand their\r\n\r\nbusiness in Singapore, and some companies say that  there\r\n\r\nwill be new investments in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we need to do a lot more and workers will feel a\r\n\r\nlot  more  comforted if they can see not just Government,\r\n\r\nunions  and workers playing their part but also employers\r\n\r\ndoing  a lot more to show that they are bringing  in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness, and raising the productivity of each sector, be\r\n\r\nit  manufacturing or in services.  In services, by making\r\n\r\nourselves competitive, the business will come.   And  for\r\n\r\nthat, the CPF changes play an important part  -  a signal\r\n\r\nthat in the long term, Singapore,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nits workers and its unions are prepared to make sure that\r\n\r\nthe  wage  levels  are commensurate  with  the  level  of\r\n\r\neconomic activity.  Then they will come.  Then there will\r\n\r\nbe  more  revenue.  And if the employers also show  their\r\n\r\npart to be seen bringing in business, then Singapore will\r\n\r\nthrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, what we do is to stem the outflow\r\n\r\nof  jobs  in both manufacturing and services by  tackling\r\n\r\nour costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Gan See Khem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Gan See Khem (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  business  sector  strongly  supports  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   proposal  to  begin  this  business   cost\r\n\r\nreduction  process by restructuring the CPF scheme.   The\r\n\r\nbusiness sector also appreciates the effort made  by  the\r\n\r\nleaders in the union movement in explaining the need  for\r\n\r\nwage  restructuring  to  their members,  and  the  sector\r\n\r\nrecognises  the  sacrifices  required  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nworkforce in this changed process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the local enterprises and the multi-national\r\n\r\nbusiness  community in Singapore whom I  have  spoken  to\r\n\r\nhave  expressed  strong support for the Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nproposal  for  the  changes  in  the  CPF  structure  and\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates.   Although the business  sector  had\r\n\r\nhoped for a straight 6% cut in the CPF contribution rate,\r\n\r\nit  does  however  appreciate the fine balance  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment needs to make to take into consideration  both\r\n\r\nthe  economic need of the business sector to reduce costs\r\n\r\nand  the  social  need of taking care  of  the  financial\r\n\r\ncommitment and livelihood of the Singaporean employee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of the multi-national companies operating\r\n\r\nin Singapore, they believe that Singapore is an excellent\r\n\r\nplace for their businesses to operate in.  They value the\r\n\r\nhigh  quality  of labour, the outstanding infrastructure,\r\n\r\nthe  excellent transportation services and the supportive\r\n\r\nGovernment  and legal structure.  However,  the  relative\r\n\r\ncosts of running businesses\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  Singapore have become very high and for many of these\r\n\r\ncompanies,  costs  now outweigh these  other  advantages.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  many of these companies are being  forced  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  level of their operations in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nshift them to other countries with more competitive  cost\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore cannot and should not compete with these\r\n\r\ncountries  for  the  lower tiered production  operations.\r\n\r\nHowever,   we   believe  a  full  range  of  productivity\r\n\r\nimprovements  and cost reductions including CPF,  overall\r\n\r\nwage  packages, taxes, fees, utilities, vehicle operating\r\n\r\ncosts  and  real estate are required in order  to  assure\r\n\r\nthat  our companies can continue to base their key  high-value operations in Singapore at competitive cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with these changes proposed in the CPF, we must\r\n\r\nrecognise   that   existing  local   and   multi-national\r\n\r\ncompanies  will continue to shift their local  operations\r\n\r\nout  of  Singapore just as they have been doing for  many\r\n\r\nyears.    Therefore,  it  is  also  important  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment accelerates its efforts to create the economic\r\n\r\nand  social  climate  necessary to  encourage  the  rapid\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  more  innovative  driven  industries  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.    Our  highly  educated,  well  trained   and\r\n\r\nproductive  workforce  offers significant  advantages  to\r\n\r\ninnovative companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have some specific comments that\r\n\r\nI  wish to make with regard to the CPF changes.  The  CPF\r\n\r\nis  an  integral part of the Singapore system.  It forces\r\n\r\nemployees  to  focus on the long term and drive  them  to\r\n\r\npursue  active  employment and work  in  order  to  build\r\n\r\nretirement  income, unlike the tax based social  security\r\n\r\nsystems  in many other countries.  The CPF scheme reduces\r\n\r\nthe  social burden on the State and enables companies and\r\n\r\ncitizens  to enjoy lower tax rates.  The CPF  scheme  has\r\n\r\nprovided  citizens with good affordable housing, provided\r\n\r\nfor  adequate  medical security and  it  is  designed  to\r\n\r\nsupport  strong family responsibilities and is  also  tax\r\n\r\nefficient for the recipient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, over recent years, citizens have moved\r\n\r\nsubstantial portions of their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsavings into housing.  This contributed to the rapid rise\r\n\r\nin  housing  prices a few years ago,  and  has  left  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts  significantly  depleted  as  the  more   recent\r\n\r\ndeclines  in  property prices have stripped away  values.\r\n\r\nAlso, the increasing life expectancy of Singaporeans, the\r\n\r\nsmaller   family  sizes  and  the  ability  to   withdraw\r\n\r\nsignificant funds at age 55 have reduced CPF's value as a\r\n\r\nretirement fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business sector supports the plan that the CPF\r\n\r\nbe restructured to focus on the retirement aspects of the\r\n\r\nplan  in a way that assures long-term financial resources\r\n\r\nfor  the retired worker and also reduces overall cost  to\r\n\r\nthe  employers.   We endorse plans to lower  the  ceiling\r\n\r\nincome  levels  for  contribution and  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  the  contribution rate by  employers  will\r\n\r\nsignificantly   reduce  business  cost   while   ensuring\r\n\r\nadequate retirement savings for the vast majority of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.    This   action,  coupled  with   the   further\r\n\r\nrestrictions on early withdrawals, will enhance the long-term security of the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An immediate reduction in employer contribution rate\r\n\r\nby  3%  is  necessary to send the appropriate message  to\r\n\r\ncompanies and workers about the urgency of cost  reforms,\r\n\r\nand to provide quick short-term savings to the employers.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the long term, the business sector's view  is\r\n\r\nthat  monthly  contribution level  should  be  made  more\r\n\r\nflexible and more new options should be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the life expectancy increasing and the\r\n\r\nincreasing  cost of living and medical care, the  current\r\n\r\nCPF Minimum Sum to be set aside for retirement may not be\r\n\r\nadequate  to serve the needs of the retiree.  A  possible\r\n\r\nscenario is that a wider range of private retirement plan\r\n\r\noptions  should be encouraged.  The CPF should  focus  on\r\n\r\nthe  basic and essential levels of income security  while\r\n\r\nemployers  and employees should be encouraged to  develop\r\n\r\nindividualised  programmes to  provide  for  more  robust\r\n\r\nretirement savings subject to their individual  financial\r\n\r\nneeds  and  abilities.   Thus,  the  CPF  can  allow  the\r\n\r\nflexibility to require a minimum total contribution at,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsay,  a range of 20-25% that could be established in  the\r\n\r\nCPF account to assure that the basic housing, medical and\r\n\r\nretirement  costs are covered.  Additional  contributions\r\n\r\nof  a  further  rate  of 10-16% can  be  indexed  through\r\n\r\nrelevant performance matrix or can be negotiated as  part\r\n\r\nof   the  annual  wage  package  to  be  set  aside   for\r\n\r\nsubscription to a private retirement plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to link compensation and employer cost to\r\n\r\ncompany  and  economic  performance,  contribution  rates\r\n\r\ncould  be  lower for fixed monthly salary components  and\r\n\r\nhigher  for  the variable components.  It is  conceivable\r\n\r\nthat  when the company performs well beyond expectations,\r\n\r\nsuch    contributions   would   exceed   the    statutory\r\n\r\nrequirements  and  vice  versa  for  years  of   economic\r\n\r\nslowdown.   This sharing of risk and reward  between  the\r\n\r\ncompany  and  its employees will bring added benefits  of\r\n\r\nfostering the strong loyalty and bond between the two.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move forward, Mr Speaker, Sir, a rising trend\r\n\r\nfor  the  new  economy  is  that companies  in  different\r\n\r\nsectors  would increasingly rely heavily on part-time  or\r\n\r\ncasual  workers who will work on a project on a part-time\r\n\r\nbasis.  Different industry sectors and new flexible  work\r\n\r\narrangements  need  flexibility in the  handling  of  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.  The business sector would like to request\r\n\r\nthe  Government to further review the provision  of  more\r\n\r\nflexibility  for  employers  to  increase  the  take-home\r\n\r\nportion  for  the contract remuneration and to  negotiate\r\n\r\nlower  or  no  CPF contribution for part-time  or  casual\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar flexibility will also be a necessity as the\r\n\r\neconomy tries to attract more SMEs to focus on innovation\r\n\r\nand the creation of new businesses.  These new firms will\r\n\r\nneed  to  start with absolute minimum payroll  cost  and,\r\n\r\ninstead,  offer larger potential downstream  payouts  for\r\n\r\nsuccessful business.  The fixed-rate CPF system will be a\r\n\r\nsignificant  disincentive to this necessary new  business\r\n\r\nsegment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  the  Singapore economy.  For the younger well-endowed\r\n\r\npart of the Singapore workforce, such flexibility may  be\r\n\r\nchallenging,  as  the  risks and rewards  will  spur  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial spirit amongst them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF reform is only part of the equation to increase\r\n\r\nSingapore's  business competitiveness.   Other  wage  and\r\n\r\ncost  reforms that were announced by the Government  need\r\n\r\nfurther  reinforcement.  For example, the NWC outline  to\r\n\r\nprovide more flexibility in pay structures and to replace\r\n\r\nseniority-based  systems with performance  based  systems\r\n\r\nare   an   absolutely  necessary  programme  to   restore\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  This should be aggressively pursued  by\r\n\r\ncompanies  and  supported  by  labour  unions   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   The  key to this reform is in  implementing\r\n\r\nstructures  with  compensation  packages  based  on   the\r\n\r\nrelative  value  of  the work being  performed  and  that\r\n\r\nprovides flexibility to adjust pay rates as economic  and\r\n\r\nbusiness  performance fluctuates.  Relative  productivity\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  operations  is also  a  critical  part  in\r\n\r\nestablishing compensation levels.  As noted  recently  in\r\n\r\nthe  press and earlier by Mr Lim Boon Heng, the  nation's\r\n\r\noverall  productivity versus labour costs is amongst  the\r\n\r\nlowest  in  the world.  Productivity must improve  before\r\n\r\nwages can again increase.  Unions and employers must work\r\n\r\ntogether   to   address   the   fundamental   issues   of\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other operating costs continue to be high in\r\n\r\ncomparison  to  competitive markets.  This is  especially\r\n\r\nimportant for foreign firms evaluating their continued or\r\n\r\nnew   investments  in  Singapore.   For  example,  office\r\n\r\nrentals, utilities and other operating costs need further\r\n\r\nevaluation as Singapore seeks to attract more innovation-driven companies to set up business in our shores.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was most moved by the vivid and\r\n\r\nsimple  language used by my Parliamentary  colleague,  Mr\r\n\r\nNithiah  Nandan, yesterday, when he voiced his,  and  the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement's, support for the need for wage reform.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, he urged the business leaders to do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  part  in  terms  of  better  management  of  their\r\n\r\nbusinesses to ensure the competitiveness and viability of\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  enterprise.   I  fully  agree  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  business sector and their leaders should  take\r\n\r\nup the challenge, both in terms of wage reform as well as\r\n\r\nimproving the business competitiveness and performance of\r\n\r\nour companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The message sent by the Government and the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  yesterday  for the CPF reform  sends  a  strong\r\n\r\nsignal that both the Government and labour are willing to\r\n\r\nmake   significant  sacrifices  and  changes   to   these\r\n\r\nstatutory costs borne by the business sector.  The labour\r\n\r\nmovement  recognises  that  without  these  changes   the\r\n\r\nnegative impact on the Singapore economy is likely to  be\r\n\r\nmuch  greater as the shift of company operations  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore accelerates over the coming months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, Mr Lim Boon Heng challenges the Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness Federation and the other business chambers to go\r\n\r\nout and bring more business to Singapore.  As a member of\r\n\r\nboth  the Singapore Business Federation and the Singapore\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber  of  Commerce, I would  most  definitely\r\n\r\nbring the views expressed by Mr Lim Boon Heng to the next\r\n\r\nmeeting and I assure Mr Lim that the SBF and the business\r\n\r\nchambers will rise to his challenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this note, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nGovernment's move to retune the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  there  is  little  disagreement  that  we  need  to\r\n\r\nurgently  address  the  problem  of  our  wage  cost   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  that  the  CPF retuning  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  just  announced  yesterday  will  go  some  way\r\n\r\ntowards this.  It is also clear that wage costs are  only\r\n\r\none component of total business costs and that many other\r\n\r\nsignificant  components need also to  be  addressed  with\r\n\r\nequal  urgency, if we are to achieve the desired  outcome\r\n\r\nto grow the economy, to safeguard and indeed to grow jobs\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans.  Many of my\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in the House have already spoken  on  various\r\n\r\naspects of this and I will not repeat their points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for a package to help Singaporeans affected\r\n\r\nby  the  CPF changes in the immediate and short-term  has\r\n\r\nalso  been  brought up, and I am sure that the  DPM  will\r\n\r\naddress  many  of these concerns later  today.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike,   however,  to  draw  attention  to  a  longer-term\r\n\r\nperspective, and highlight that, while appreciating  that\r\n\r\nthe  subject currently in debate very necessarily focused\r\n\r\non  immediate and urgent matters, we do not lose track in\r\n\r\nthe  process  of  the  longer-term  retirement  needs  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    The  huge  challenge   of   our   ageing\r\n\r\ndemographics  that prompted the formation of  the  Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Ageing Population,  not  too\r\n\r\nmany  years  ago,  still  looms ahead.   And  the  issues\r\n\r\nidentified,  in  particular, in  the  area  of  financial\r\n\r\nsecurity, stand very much at risk in the current scenario\r\n\r\nof the impending diminished contributions to CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At $252 or even $378 a month, our senior citizens\r\n\r\nwill  be hard-put to make ends meet.  Worse still,  there\r\n\r\nare  significant numbers of older people right  now,  and\r\n\r\ninto the foreseeable future, who will not manage to reach\r\n\r\nthe  targeted  Minimum Sum at retirement on  which  these\r\n\r\ncalculations are based.  For too long, Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\ngrown  up  and grown old thinking that their CPF  savings\r\n\r\nwould    take    care   of   their   retirement    needs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, along the way we have been led into  using\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  to achieve other objectives,  such  as  home\r\n\r\nownership  and healthcare financing, leaving insufficient\r\n\r\ncash  for  the original and primary objective.   So  many\r\n\r\nneeds  and  requirements have been intertwined  into  the\r\n\r\nwhole  scheme that we can see, even though with  so  many\r\n\r\npowerful minds that we have in the Cabinet, it is proving\r\n\r\nvery  difficult to implement changes to achieve  one  end\r\n\r\nwithout doing severe injury to other parts of the whole - a  clear illustration of the teachings in Economics  101,\r\n\r\nas  they say, that you should use one instrument for  one\r\n\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that CPF alone is not enough and\r\n\r\nGovernment  must look at what can be done  to  supplement\r\n\r\nCPF  as  the  only source of retirement income  on  which\r\n\r\npeople  rely  on  their old age.  An analogy  I  recently\r\n\r\nheard likens it to drinking from only one well.  If  that\r\n\r\nwell   runs  dry,  it  is  a  disaster.   I  would  like,\r\n\r\ntherefore,   to  urge  that  in  our  new  and   evolving\r\n\r\ncircumstances, we rethink to consider a system  where  we\r\n\r\ncan  draw from many other wells, including some  such  as\r\n\r\nminimum  pension benefits, social security-type  systems,\r\n\r\ninsurance-based instruments, private retirement plans, as\r\n\r\nmy  colleague,  Dr  Gan  has just  mentioned,  and  other\r\n\r\nschemes that financial and economic experts can design.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we have always in the past responded\r\n\r\nnegatively   to   any   such   suggestions.    But    the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  have  changed from our  heady  high-growth\r\n\r\nfull-employment  days  when we  could,  with  confidence,\r\n\r\nsweepingly dismiss those who do not put enough aside  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  old age as perhaps people who are not  trying\r\n\r\nhard  enough  and who should not be encouraged  in  their\r\n\r\ngrasshopper  ways.  I believe it is time  to  pause,  and\r\n\r\nafter  this quick action, to respond to immediate  needs,\r\n\r\nto  do  a  thorough review of how we need to  drill  more\r\n\r\nwells  for a more robust system for the retirement  needs\r\n\r\nof  our population, not just for the top 20% but for  the\r\n\r\nmajority, into the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am just concerned that we will see a repetition of\r\n\r\na  situation  similar  to what we are  experiencing  with\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment.   We  had  actually  identified\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment as a concern many years ago,  and\r\n\r\nI  remember serving on more than one committee, where the\r\n\r\nsubject  was discussed.  But because the problem did  not\r\n\r\nseem  imminent at that time, we just did not  pay  enough\r\n\r\nattention to pushing hard enough for solutions and now we\r\n\r\nfind  ourselves unprepared, smack in the  middle  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  Let us not be caught similarly unprepared  with\r\n\r\nthe  retirement needs of older Singaporeans when the  day\r\n\r\ncomes that the over-65s\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nform 20% of our population.  At that time, there will  be\r\n\r\ntoo  many for us to take that case-by-case approach  that\r\n\r\nour Ministers favour currently when we bring up issues of\r\n\r\nneeds of various segments of the population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, before I end, I would like to pick up one\r\n\r\npoint  for  a  specific group, and that is  homemakers  - housewives  who  are  dependent on  their  husbands,  and\r\n\r\nsubsequently   their  children,  for  financial   support\r\n\r\nbecause  they are not in the workforce.  They  would,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, not have a CPF account, and if they do, it  would\r\n\r\ngenerally  be  an inactive one with a minuscule  balance.\r\n\r\nThey  have totally no say in what their spouses  do  with\r\n\r\ntheir  own  CPF  balances  and, particularly,  after  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  age of 55.  I am happy, therefore,  that  the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum will need in future to be topped  up  before\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  is  allowed so that at least that  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney  is  not unthinkingly spent on pursuit of immediate\r\n\r\ngratifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the problem remains that a spouse could\r\n\r\nwill  away  his CPF balance, leaving his widow without  a\r\n\r\ncent.   I,  and many other colleagues in the House,  past\r\n\r\nand  present,  have broached the subject before,  without\r\n\r\nsuccess,  of  splitting or sharing the CPF account  of  a\r\n\r\nperson   with   a  non-working  spouse.    As   part   of\r\n\r\nGovernment's  review  of  the  system,  may  I  bring  an\r\n\r\nalternative  solution,  namely,  to  require   that   the\r\n\r\nendorsement  of the spouse is required for nomination  of\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries  to  CPF accounts and  for  any  subsequent\r\n\r\nchanges to the nominees.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of the policies that had been announced  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister to retune the CPF system.  Sir,  for  the\r\n\r\nlongest  time  the  CPF  system  has  fostered   a   high\r\n\r\ncompulsory  saving  regime  in  Singapore,  probably  the\r\n\r\nhighest  in the world and this policy adjustment that  we\r\n\r\nare going through now, while it is difficult and comes at\r\n\r\na  time  when  we  could do without it at the  individual\r\n\r\nlevel,  I think it is an opportunity for us at the system\r\n\r\nlevel to recalibrate and reposition for the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question I wanted to address was what\r\n\r\nsignal this set of measures has sent out to the market in\r\n\r\ngeneral.   It  is quite clear that the Government's  move\r\n\r\nfrom  a 40% contribution rate to a 36% contribution  rate\r\n\r\nhas  been  unambiguously understood and received  by  the\r\n\r\nmarket.   Businesses see this as a clear signal from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that it recognises the competitive  pressures\r\n\r\nthat   businesses  are  under  in  Singapore   and   they\r\n\r\nappreciate  the readiness of the Government to  undertake\r\n\r\nsome  painful  and  tough measures in  order  to  sustain\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.    At  the  level  of   the   individual\r\n\r\nSingaporean and the worker, that move from 40% to 36% has\r\n\r\nalso   communicated  the  radically  different   economic\r\n\r\nenvironment we are in and the need to moderate  our  wage\r\n\r\nexpectations, and with it, in a sense to recalibrate  our\r\n\r\nlifestyles.   So that move from the 40% to 36%  has  been\r\n\r\ncommunicated and received with relative clarity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the 33% peg for the revised contribution\r\n\r\nrate  and the range the Prime Minister has announced from\r\n\r\n30-36% has given rise to some mixed signals.  In the case\r\n\r\nof  the  business community, some preliminary feedback  I\r\n\r\nget  is that while they appreciate the 3% reduction  they\r\n\r\nsee  this  as a short-term reduction in cost because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  retained  the  option  to  go  up  to  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  rate  of  as high as 36%.   So  for  long-term\r\n\r\nbusiness planning purposes, they will continue to use the\r\n\r\n36%  number  as their reference point.  So if our  intent\r\n\r\nwas  to  signal to businesses there is a lower  rate  and\r\n\r\nthat  should  affect  their  business  decisions  in  the\r\n\r\nmargin,  then  this  may not have  been  convincingly  or\r\n\r\nclearly  conveyed.   At  the same  time,  for  individual\r\n\r\nworkers, I think our intent was to say we need to adjust,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to refocus on the basics of how we can compete.\r\n\r\nThat being the case, clearly we did not want them to have\r\n\r\nan  expectation or build their lifestyle on a higher rate\r\n\r\nof  CPF contribution.  But the focus now is that, yes, we\r\n\r\nare  at  33% today but, when times are good, it  will  go\r\n\r\nback  to  36%.  And I think that might have an unintended\r\n\r\neffect in the way they plan their decisions or make their\r\n\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this approach of defining a range for CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution also reinforces the perception of CPF  as  a\r\n\r\ntool  of  economic  policy for  the  Government.   As  Dr\r\n\r\nJennifer Lee and others have pointed out, the CPF  scheme\r\n\r\nhas been loaded with many objectives, superannuation, the\r\n\r\ncore, and then home ownership, medical benefits.  And  it\r\n\r\nhas also been used as a tool to reduce business costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new scheme varies the contribution rate from 30%\r\n\r\nto  36%,  and that variation will depend on the  business\r\n\r\ncycle.    Yet,  our  CPF  scheme  is  designed  to   help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  cope  with  long-term  requirements,   like\r\n\r\nretirement, housing where you may take 25-30-year  loans,\r\n\r\nand  medical  costs  in the long  run.   So  there  is  a\r\n\r\nmismatch  in  tenure because, in that timeframe,  you  go\r\n\r\nthrough many business cycles, at least three or four.  So\r\n\r\nthere  is  going to be this variation in the contribution\r\n\r\nrate  and  it  is  going to create uncertainty.   So  the\r\n\r\nquestion  is  of  course  why  the  Government  did   not\r\n\r\nprescribe  one long-term CPF contribution rate  based  on\r\n\r\nits   assessment  of  current  economic  environment  and\r\n\r\ncompetitive challenges.  I know this is not an easy task,\r\n\r\ngiven  the  dynamic environment we live in and  certainly\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members,  like Mr Low, would  make  political\r\n\r\ncapital out of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this Government has never shied away from making\r\n\r\ntough  decisions, and particularly on this one, I thought\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of coming out with a clear reference  point\r\n\r\nfor  CPF  contribution would give a lot of  certainty  to\r\n\r\nemployers  and businesses, on the one hand,  and  also  a\r\n\r\nclear  signal  to our workforce, in terms  of  what  they\r\n\r\nshould be expecting.  This would also allow us to take  a\r\n\r\nvery  definitive position on constraining the CPF to  its\r\n\r\ncore purposes - superannuation, medical benefits and only\r\n\r\nthe  residual  should be used for housing and  allow  the\r\n\r\nadjustments, if any, according to the business cycle,  to\r\n\r\nbe  from  variable wages and discretionary  savings  that\r\n\r\nindividuals  have.   So I did feel  that  the  Government\r\n\r\ncould  have  been more specific in its recommendation  of\r\n\r\nthe long-term CPF contribution rate and hope\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  we  will  get some clarification on  the  rationale\r\n\r\nbehind the range approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also this question of trust. Has the\r\n\r\npeople's  trust  in the Government been lost  because  of\r\n\r\nthis  exercise?   And I heard Mr Low  Thia  Khiang  speak\r\n\r\nearlier  that  this  is  a breach.   I  tend  to  take  a\r\n\r\ndifferent point of view and this is not hypothetical.  It\r\n\r\nis  based  on  empirical data.   Last  night,  I  met  an\r\n\r\nindividual who works two jobs.  He works part time  in  a\r\n\r\nprinting company and he earns $500 there.  He works as  a\r\n\r\ncar  park  attendant and he earns another $500 there.   I\r\n\r\nhappened to bump into him in the car park and he said  to\r\n\r\nme,  \"I  heard the Prime Minister's speech  and  I  fully\r\n\r\nsupport  it.  Because I know that when the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand the Government do this, they are thinking of the long-term interests of the country and they are trying to look\r\n\r\nafter  us.\"  And it is not just one individual's comment,\r\n\r\nit also came from a dialogue I had chaired two nights ago\r\n\r\nwhere  the issue was not so much a lack of confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government or loss of trust, but it was more  about,\r\n\r\nafter  this,  what  else can we do in  order  to  achieve\r\n\r\ngrowth and bring back the jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is really the quid pro quo that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare looking at.  They are prepared to take the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThey  are  prepared to absorb the pain.  But, in  return,\r\n\r\nthey  would  like to know when would the jobs come  back.\r\n\r\nHow  would they be created?  And what else would be  done\r\n\r\nto lower the business costs so that more businesses would\r\n\r\nstay  in  Singapore or come to Singapore.   For  example,\r\n\r\nwill  the  reduction be passed through the civil  service\r\n\r\nsystem to achieve lower costs or charges, or will  it  be\r\n\r\npassed  on  as well to civil servants so that  they  have\r\n\r\ntheir pay increase in order to compensate for the loss of\r\n\r\nthe CPF contribution?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, ultimately, the trade-off here that we are\r\n\r\nlooking  for is also jobs and, in the meantime,  measures\r\n\r\nto  help  them  ride through the difficulty.   The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said that these are extraordinary times\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  require extraordinary measures, and I  agree.   And\r\n\r\nthe review of one of the core policies, like CPF, clearly\r\n\r\nindicates the gravity of the situation.  But I think this\r\n\r\nis  also a time for us to review some other core policies\r\n\r\nor  philosophies  that underpin our  policy  approach  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example is our attitude towards financial\r\n\r\nassistance to individuals.  Our philosophy has,  for  the\r\n\r\nlongest time, been underpinned by the desire not to breed\r\n\r\na  crutch  mentality among Singaporeans, not to have  the\r\n\r\nwelfare state, and to focus instead very tightly on those\r\n\r\nwho  are  in real need.  So our criteria have  been  very\r\n\r\ntightly  defined,  the  processes have  been  stringently\r\n\r\nadministered so that Singaporeans have to try  very  hard\r\n\r\nbefore  they  can  achieve some level of  relief  through\r\n\r\nthese measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in a situation today where I think a review\r\n\r\nof  our  approach and a broadening of the group  that  we\r\n\r\nseek  to help is justified.  For example, we have a class\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans, older but less educated,  who  are  not\r\n\r\nlikely   to  be  re-employed  easily  when  the   economy\r\n\r\nrecovers.   They  are the structurally  unemployable,  or\r\n\r\nunemployed.  Yet, these are the individuals who made many\r\n\r\nsacrifices in the early years in building up the  country\r\n\r\nbut they may have little savings, both in the CPF and  in\r\n\r\nthe  discretionary accounts.  Another group  is  the  so-called  sandwiched group whose incomes are too  high  for\r\n\r\nwelfare  but  too  low to be able to  absorb  the  shocks\r\n\r\nthrough  discretionary savings.  They are  the  ones  who\r\n\r\nprobably may be earning just over $1,500 a month so  that\r\n\r\nthey  cannot participate or benefit from the HOPE scheme.\r\n\r\nThey  are  the ones who may be earning more than  $800  a\r\n\r\nmonth so they cannot rent an HDB flat.  They are the ones\r\n\r\nwho  live  in  4-room flats with two  children  going  to\r\n\r\nschool who, on a month-to-month cashflow basis, are  just\r\n\r\nbarely meeting it so that one adjustment like this  would\r\n\r\ncost them considerable adjustment pains.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not recalcitrants looking for a free\r\n\r\nride, people who come with their cap in hand at the first\r\n\r\nsign of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrouble.  They are honourable Singaporeans.  Many  of  us\r\n\r\nhave  seen them at our meet-the-people sessions and other\r\n\r\ncontacts.   They  believe in hard work and  they  swallow\r\n\r\ntheir  pride when they come and ask for help, not because\r\n\r\ntheir  work ethic has been eroded but because  they  have\r\n\r\nfallen on hard times, and it is beyond their control  and\r\n\r\nthey are unable to manage the consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Government must be prepared in this\r\n\r\ncontext  to come out with both short-term measures  aimed\r\n\r\nat  those who need relief during this cyclical period  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can withstand the pain and when the  recovery\r\n\r\ncomes, benefit from it.  At the same time, the Government\r\n\r\nmust  set  in  place  measures to help  the  structurally\r\n\r\nunemployed  or  those  who are going  to  have  long-term\r\n\r\nissues adjusting to the economy, as it comes out of  this\r\n\r\ndownturn.  I think DPM's speech later today would  be  an\r\n\r\nimportant one in that regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also the issue of another core policy,\r\n\r\nhousing.   We have always espoused the goal of  universal\r\n\r\nhome ownership, and I think about 90% of Singaporeans own\r\n\r\ntheir  homes.  The question is whether this policy  tends\r\n\r\nto   result  in  an  over-consumption  of  housing  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Do  we put too much of  our  wealth  into\r\n\r\nhousing?  Do we seek to continue to invest in housing  as\r\n\r\na form of upgrading?  And to what extent is this a result\r\n\r\nof  our  general  policy  to promote  home  ownership  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the goal of universal home ownership is\r\n\r\nvalid.   It  gives  a stake in Singapore  and  we  should\r\n\r\ncontinue to hold that close to our heart.  But how we get\r\n\r\nthere and how we facilitate that is an entirely different\r\n\r\nquestion.  For example, should Government housing  really\r\n\r\nbe  focused  in  providing 4-room and  especially  5-room\r\n\r\nhousing?  Should we not just focus Government housing  at\r\n\r\nthe  entry  level, or even slightly below for  those  who\r\n\r\ncannot  afford it, so that we focus on 4-room  for  those\r\n\r\nwho  can afford to buy it and review the issue of 1-,  2- and 3-room flats?  The need for rental housing is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngrowing, not just because of an economic downturn, but  I\r\n\r\nthink there will be those who may not want to lock up  so\r\n\r\nmuch  of their wealth in a house.  But the rental  market\r\n\r\nis   relatively  tight  because  of  the   supply   being\r\n\r\nrelatively  small.   Can  we  look  at  freeing  up  that\r\n\r\ncomponent  of  HDB  housing so that  more  can  make  the\r\n\r\nchoice, instead of buying, to rent?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tied to that is the issue of whether Government\r\n\r\nshould revisit its policy of not building any further 1-,\r\n\r\n2-  and 3-room flats.  I think we need to calibrate this.\r\n\r\nObviously,   we  do  not  want  to  have  an  over-supply\r\n\r\nsituation  for 1-, 2- and 3-room flats when  the  economy\r\n\r\nrecovers.   But  we  need  to  look  at  the  longer-term\r\n\r\nposition,  in  terms  of what percentage  of  the  public\r\n\r\nhousing  market should really be at this level of  rental\r\n\r\nand 3-room type housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Government would use this opportunity,\r\n\r\nnot  just  to  stop at the CPF system, but  also  to  re-examine  some  of  these other core policies  which  have\r\n\r\nguided  us  over  the last 38 years but,  going  forward,\r\n\r\nwould  need  to  be  re-examined  and,  where  necessary,\r\n\r\nfundamentally  repositioned.   And  I  hope  this  is  an\r\n\r\nopportunity that the Government will seize.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The Iraq war  and  the\r\n\r\nSARS  outbreak  have  taken a  significant  toll  on  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  MTI now expects it to grow by between 0% and 1%\r\n\r\nfor the whole of 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF changes are an important step to make\r\n\r\nourselves  more  competitive.   It  makes  a  significant\r\n\r\ndifference to employers, especially those in the  labour-intensive  industries.  In the short term, the lower  CPF\r\n\r\nrate, together with wage restructuring efforts, will help\r\n\r\nto save jobs.  It buys time for businesses to restructure\r\n\r\nand for Singaporeans to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nupgrade  their capabilities to retrain and  reskill.   In\r\n\r\nthe long term, a lower CPF rate will mean a more flexible\r\n\r\nwage system.  And the changes to the withdrawal rules  at\r\n\r\n55  will make sure that Singaporeans set aside enough for\r\n\r\ntheir old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as many MPs have pointed out, while we make\r\n\r\nthese  strategic changes to the economy,  we  should  not\r\n\r\nforget the more immediate worries of Singaporeans.   Some\r\n\r\nare  finding  it  hard to service their mortgages.   Low-income  families  are  worried about  making  ends  meet.\r\n\r\nWorkers  are afraid of losing their jobs, and people  who\r\n\r\nhave  been retrenched are anxious to find new jobs. These\r\n\r\nare  real worries.  The CPF changes come on top of  them,\r\n\r\nand will affect nearly every Singaporean.  The Government\r\n\r\nwill  therefore  implement  a  package  of  measures   to\r\n\r\npreserve   jobs,   help   individual   Singaporeans   and\r\n\r\nbusinesses, and promote new business activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures fall into six categories:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Help with mortgage payments;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) HDB policy changes;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Help for Singaporeans;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Help for businesses;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Acceleration of infrastructure projects; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Government cost cutting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will benefit Singaporeans, especially\r\n\r\nlower income earners and the unemployed.  Businesses will\r\n\r\nalso gain, especially the SMEs. Let me elaborate on them,\r\n\r\nstarting with mortgage payments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Help with mortgage payments</i></b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand that many homeowners are concerned\r\n\r\nabout  the  impact of the CPF changes on  their  mortgage\r\n\r\npayments.   Nobody welcomes lower CPF contributions,  and\r\n\r\nsome  homeowners  will have genuine  difficulties  making\r\n\r\nends meet.  Several MPs - Mr Zainul Abidin,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMr  Nithiah  Nandan, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua - have raised  this\r\n\r\nconcern.  Let me assure the House that the great majority\r\n\r\nof  homeowners can cope with the CPF changes,  either  on\r\n\r\ntheir own, or perhaps with a little bit of help from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We have encountered and dealt with this same\r\n\r\nproblem  before.  In 1999, when we  cut  the  CPF  by  10\r\n\r\npercentage  points, we accompanied the cut with  measures\r\n\r\nto help people who would not have enough to service their\r\n\r\nmortgages.   Very  few people actually needed  the  extra\r\n\r\nhelp,  but  the  schemes gave comfort and reassurance  to\r\n\r\nmany.   This time, the problem should be smaller, as  the\r\n\r\ncut  is  only three percentage points.  Nevertheless,  we\r\n\r\nwill  make  sure that help is available to  everyone  who\r\n\r\nneeds it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have studied how many homeowners with mortgages\r\n\r\nwill  be affected. There are 577,000 CPF members who  use\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF to pay mortgages.  Of these, currently 218,000\r\n\r\n(38%)  experience  shortfalls,  which  means  that  their\r\n\r\nmonthly  CPF  contributions are less than  their  monthly\r\n\r\nmortgage  payments.  So, they are paying their  mortgages\r\n\r\npartly  out  of the CPF and partly out of cash  or  other\r\n\r\nsources.  With the CPF changes, the number will go up  to\r\n\r\n294,000  (51%),  ie, about 76,000 (13%) more.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, right now, about one-third of the people using CPF\r\n\r\nfor mortgages from other sources.  After the CPF changes,\r\n\r\nslightly  more than half will need to top up  from  other\r\n\r\nsources.    So,  there  are  going  to  be  76,000   more\r\n\r\nhomeowners  who need to top up.  Most of them  will  have\r\n\r\nquite small shortfalls - less than $200 per month.  It is\r\n\r\nthose  in  the  higher income group who have  the  larger\r\n\r\nshortfalls,  because their contributions to the  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount (OA) are limited by the CPF salary ceiling.   So,\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income  groups  will  in  fact  have  smaller\r\n\r\nshortfalls,  because  the 3% of CPF  will  add  up  to  a\r\n\r\nsmaller absolute amount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a shortfall does not necessarily mean a\r\n\r\nproblem.   Many members with shortfalls will be  able  to\r\n\r\ncope, because their monthly contribution to the OA is not\r\n\r\ntheir  only  source of funding.  They may  top  up  their\r\n\r\nmortgage payments using their personal savings, from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  take-home pay or by dipping into their accumulated\r\n\r\nOA  balances.  And that is what 218,000 CPF  members  now\r\n\r\ndo.   After  the  CPF cut, this number will  increase  to\r\n\r\n294,000, but most of these members have sizeable balances\r\n\r\nin  their  CPF OA, especially the older ones.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nabout  two-thirds of these people will have  OA  balances\r\n\r\nwhich can cover their shortfalls for two years or longer.\r\n\r\nSo,  the  first  source of fall back is the  OA  balances\r\n\r\nwhich  people  have  built  up,  and  the  older  members\r\n\r\ngenerally  have built up bigger OA balances  and  so  can\r\n\r\nlast longer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, unavoidably, a small proportion of homeowners\r\n\r\nwill  not have enough in their OA and may not have enough\r\n\r\ncash incomes to make up the shortfall.  So, we are taking\r\n\r\nseveral steps to help this minority group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in designing the CPF changes, we have made\r\n\r\nadjustments  to lessen the impact on borrowers.   As  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  explained  yesterday,  with  the  lower\r\n\r\noverall  contribution rate, and the change in  withdrawal\r\n\r\nrules  at 55, we have lowered our targets for the Special\r\n\r\nAccount  (SA)  and  Medisave  Account  (MA)  contribution\r\n\r\nrates,  so  that  there  is more left  for  the  OA  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  a smaller impact on their ability to  service\r\n\r\ntheir mortgages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, three-quarters (76%) of CPF members who\r\n\r\nexperience shortfalls borrow from HDB.  All they need  is\r\n\r\nfor  the  loan  to  be restructured slightly,  either  by\r\n\r\nextending the loan period to lower their monthly mortgage\r\n\r\npayment, or by working out a ballooning scheme with  HDB,\r\n\r\nif  they need to.  HDB will assist these mortgagors,  and\r\n\r\nexercise  flexibility on a case-by-case basis.  In  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  homeowners are already in financial  difficulties,\r\n\r\nHDB  allows them to pay their arrears by instalments,  or\r\n\r\nto  defer payments temporarily.  And the HDB has  a  long\r\n\r\nmenu  of  other arrangements to help.  MPs know that  the\r\n\r\nHDB, if anything, is forbearing to a fault.  The Minister\r\n\r\nfor   National  Development  will  elaborate   on   these\r\n\r\narrangements later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the CPF has measures to help from its end.\r\n\r\nCPF  members can use their SA to top-up the shortfall  in\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF  mortgage payments, to the extent  that  these\r\n\r\npayments  are  affected  by the CPF  changes.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  if your OA is cut by 3% and therefore you do  not\r\n\r\nhave  enough  in your OA, then you can take out  that  3%\r\n\r\nfrom  your Special Account to pay your mortgage.  Because\r\n\r\nyou have already committed to the mortgage, I think it is\r\n\r\nunfair for us to change the rules on you midstream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF will also extend bridging loans to those\r\n\r\nfacing shortfalls in mortgage payments resulting from the\r\n\r\nCPF  changes.  If you need to tide over a certain period,\r\n\r\nwe  will give you a bridging loan.  I do not expect  many\r\n\r\nto  need bridging loans.  The last time we did this, when\r\n\r\nwe  cut the CPF in 1999, only 125 people signed up in the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  Singapore, and they only needed  to  borrow  a\r\n\r\ntotal of $227,000.  And so far, 45 have already paid back\r\n\r\nfully.  So while the scheme is available, it is really  a\r\n\r\nfinal and last resort, in case all the other arrangements\r\n\r\nare not sufficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to read in the papers today that the\r\n\r\ncommercial  banks  are  also  exercising  flexibility  to\r\n\r\nrestructure their mortgage loans to help borrowers  cope.\r\n\r\nAll  these  measures will ensure that very few homeowners\r\n\r\nwill   experience  difficulty  servicing  their  mortgage\r\n\r\npayments as a result of the CPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>HDB Policy Changes</i></b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we are going to make significant HDB\r\n\r\npolicy  changes.   A main objective  of  the  CPF  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  steady and sufficient income for Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin  old age.  In the CPF scheme, savings for old age  are\r\n\r\nintimately  linked with savings for home  ownership.   On\r\n\r\nthe   one  hand,  an  HDB  flat  is  the  most  important\r\n\r\ninvestment and most important asset of most families.  It\r\n\r\nis  an  investment  which should  help  provide  for  the\r\n\r\nmembers' old age.  On the other hand, the flat absorbs  a\r\n\r\nlarge part of the members' savings, leaving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany  members with only enough cash in their  CPF  for  a\r\n\r\nmodest  monthly  sum in retirement, barely  adequate  for\r\n\r\ntheir  basic  needs.  Even with the new  Minimum  Sum  of\r\n\r\n$120,000,  half of which can be in a housing  pledge  and\r\n\r\nhalf  of  which is in cash, the cash portion  of  $60,000\r\n\r\nwill  yield a monthly payment of only $378, if the  money\r\n\r\nis  to  last until the member is 80 years old.   So,  the\r\n\r\nconclusion   is,  we  need  to  find  better   ways   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  benefit from the  value  of  their  HDB\r\n\r\nflats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB flat is not a dead asset. A retiree should\r\n\r\nbe  able to use it to supplement the monthly amount  from\r\n\r\nhis  CPF, either by downgrading to a smaller flat, or  by\r\n\r\nrenting  it out and collecting rent, and moving  in  with\r\n\r\nhis  children  or  his  children's in-laws  or  even  his\r\n\r\ngrandchildren.   However,  our  rules  on  subletting  of\r\n\r\nentire  HDB  flats are quite restrictive.   For  example,\r\n\r\nuntil  quite  recently,  the  owner  had  to  be  working\r\n\r\noverseas.   And Members will know that many  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntried to get around this by the device of locking up  one\r\n\r\nroom  -  the body is gone, the spirit is still  somewhere\r\n\r\ninside there!  So, in January this year, HDB relaxed  the\r\n\r\nrules  to  allow  an  owner to sublet  his  entire  flat,\r\n\r\nprovided  he  had  not  enjoyed any housing  or  mortgage\r\n\r\nsubsidy on his flat, had lived in it for 10 years and did\r\n\r\nnot  have  an outstanding loan from the HDB.  So,  it  is\r\n\r\nquite  a  stringent rule: no housing subsidy, no mortgage\r\n\r\nsubsidy, 10 years living in it, no outstanding loan.  But\r\n\r\nonly a handful have taken up this scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will now relax the subletting rules further.\r\n\r\nFrom  1st  October 2003, flat owners who  have  lived  in\r\n\r\ntheir  flat for at least 15 years can sublet their entire\r\n\r\nflat, regardless of whether the flat had been bought with\r\n\r\na subsidy, and even if they still have an outstanding HDB\r\n\r\nloan.  If the flat owner does not have an outstanding HDB\r\n\r\nloan,  then he can sublet his entire flat after occupying\r\n\r\nit for only 10 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this relaxation, about 250,000 HDB flat owners\r\n\r\nwill  become eligible to sublet their flats.   This  will\r\n\r\nprovide  them with a source of income for old age.   From\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperspective  of  people looking for  housing,  this  will\r\n\r\nenlarge  the  HDB's  flat  rental  market  and  offer  an\r\n\r\nadditional   option   to  young   couples   and   budding\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, and others who are not ready  or  not  yet\r\n\r\nwilling to commit to a house purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Maintaining home ownership policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that encouraging home ownership remains a\r\n\r\nfundamental objective of the Government's public  housing\r\n\r\npolicy  and  a  key purpose of the CPF.   Home  ownership\r\n\r\npromotes  rootedness  and  a  sense  of  belonging  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  The HDB will price its flats such that 90%\r\n\r\nof  Singaporean households can still afford at least a 3-room flat, even at the lower CPF contribution rates.   If\r\n\r\nwe need to adjust the prices, we will do so. We have done\r\n\r\nour  sums  and  we  know  that  even  at  the  lower  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates,  at least 90%  of  Singaporeans  can\r\n\r\nafford  to buy their own 3-room flats.  HDB will continue\r\n\r\nto  help  low-income  families to  buy  flats  under  its\r\n\r\nSpecial Housing Assistance Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extending the Public Rental Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee and others yesterday asked if the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  offer other housing  alternatives  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Minister Mah Bow Tan repeatedly counselled\r\n\r\nthem  to be patient.  But I am sure that Dr Lee would  be\r\n\r\nhappy  to  know that HDB will relax its rules  on  rental\r\n\r\nflats, but within the overall framework of promoting home\r\n\r\nownership.   Currently, the household income  ceiling  to\r\n\r\nrent  1-  and 2-room flats under the HDB's Public  Rental\r\n\r\nScheme  is  $800 per month.  In other words, a  household\r\n\r\nwith  a maximum income of $800 can rent a flat from  HDB.\r\n\r\nMany  MPs have asked for this to be raised. We have  been\r\n\r\nreluctant to do so because we prefer to give more help to\r\n\r\nlow-income  families to buy flats and  become  homeowners\r\n\r\nrather  than  to  have them become permanent  tenants  in\r\n\r\nrental flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as our economy restructures, some\r\n\r\nhouseholds earning more than $800\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  month  will have difficulty sustaining home ownership.\r\n\r\nNo  matter  how  easy we make it for  households  to  buy\r\n\r\nflats,  there will still be some at the margins  who  are\r\n\r\neither  not  ready to buy flats, and who need  affordable\r\n\r\nrental  housing on a temporary basis, perhaps for a  year\r\n\r\nor  two,  until conditions have stabilised and  they  can\r\n\r\ncommit  to  a  flat.   To help them, we  will  raise  the\r\n\r\nhousehold income ceiling for rental flats under the HDB's\r\n\r\nPublic Rental Scheme from $800 to $1,500 per month.  This\r\n\r\nwill  cover about one-quarter of the households. However,\r\n\r\nhouseholds earning more than $800 a month will  receive a\r\n\r\nlower  subsidy  on their flat rentals than those  earning\r\n\r\nless  than $800.  They will thus pay higher rents, though\r\n\r\nit  will  still  be subsidised and very affordable.  This\r\n\r\nwill  encourage them to purchase their own flats as  soon\r\n\r\nas they are able to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Help for Singaporeans</i></b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Government will implement measures to help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  cope  with the slow  economy  and  the  CPF\r\n\r\nchanges.  We  have done many such measures since  1998  - successive   packages,  successive  schemes,  variations,\r\n\r\nalternatives, enhancements, improvements, etc.  Over  six\r\n\r\nyears since the Asian crisis, we have had quite a lot  of\r\n\r\nexperience  helping people where it is most needed.  Last\r\n\r\nyear, we staggered the increase in the GST rate, from  3%\r\n\r\nto  5%  over two years, instead of doing it in one  step.\r\n\r\nBut  we  still  paid  out the full amount  of  the  first\r\n\r\ntranche  of  the Economic Restructuring Shares.   So,  we\r\n\r\nhave  more  than  offset the GST increase  last  January.\r\n\r\nThis  year's  Budget also included further assistance  to\r\n\r\nhouseholds to help pay utilities, service and conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges and housing rentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have urged the Government to do more to\r\n\r\nlessen  the  cost burden on Singaporeans.  The Government\r\n\r\nagreed and we will do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Utilities-Save Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will provide more help for low-income\r\n\r\nfamilies. We will do so by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexpanding  the  Utilities-Save scheme.  We  have  already\r\n\r\ngiven  Utilities-Save  rebates  for  households  in  this\r\n\r\nyear's  Budget.  The Government will now give  a  further\r\n\r\nonce-off rebate of $200 for those living in 1- and 2-room\r\n\r\nHDB  flats, $100 for those in 3-room flats, $50 for those\r\n\r\nin  4-room  flats and $30 for those in 5-room flats.   So\r\n\r\nUtilities-Save is weighted towards those in the  smallest\r\n\r\nflats and the poorer families.  The rebates for the 1-, 2- and  3-room flats will be paid in December this year  and\r\n\r\nalso in February next year, while the rebates for the  4- and  5-room  flats  will be paid in December  this  year.\r\n\r\nThese rebates cost $54 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Setting up public transport funds</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, public transport. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang\r\n\r\nyesterday  asked  if the transport operators  could  give\r\n\r\nvouchers to needy families to help them buy their monthly\r\n\r\ntickets.   This is a practical idea, although  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure  that the transport companies want to set up welfare\r\n\r\ndepartments to administer the scheme.  But there are ways\r\n\r\nthat  it can be done.  The Land Transport Authority (LTA)\r\n\r\nhas  been discussing with the public transport operators.\r\n\r\nSBS Transit and SMRT are working with the NTUC to set  up\r\n\r\na  fund,  to help the families of needy union members  to\r\n\r\ntop  up ez-link cards or purchase season cards.  The CDCs\r\n\r\nhave also got together to set up a similar fund with  the\r\n\r\ntransport operators, so that non-union members will  also\r\n\r\nbe covered.  This will help to keep public transport cost\r\n\r\naffordable  for Singaporeans.  I believe that  the  NTUC,\r\n\r\nthe  CDCs  and the transport companies will announce  the\r\n\r\ndetails soon.  I urge Members to be patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Containing healthcare costs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Ministry of Health is getting its\r\n\r\nhospitals to go all out to save money for their patients.\r\n\r\nThe  Cluster CEOs are personally championing this  drive.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to treat the same illness.  There  is\r\n\r\na  range of drugs, implants, medical devices that we  can\r\n\r\nuse,   at  very  different  prices,  often  with  similar\r\n\r\nclinical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noutcome.   By  standardising surgical supplies,  such  as\r\n\r\ngloves, we save money for hospitals and for our patients.\r\n\r\nBy centralising purchases of drugs, we get bulk discounts\r\n\r\nand  gain bargaining power.  By coordinating better  when\r\n\r\ntransferring patients between hospitals and  clinics,  we\r\n\r\ncut  out  unnecessary X-rays, laboratory tests  and  even\r\n\r\nrepeat  prescriptions.   If we take  this  economy  drive\r\n\r\nseriously,  at every level, there are countless  ways  to\r\n\r\ncut out costs without affecting clinical outcome. This is\r\n\r\nwhy  MOH will be publishing hospital bill sizes of common\r\n\r\nillnesses so that hospitals can learn from one another on\r\n\r\nhow  to  render  good reliable medical  services  at  the\r\n\r\nlowest possible cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, older workers will need extra help,\r\n\r\nespecially those who have lost their jobs. These  workers\r\n\r\nare  more  likely  to  be retrenched,  and  have  greater\r\n\r\ndifficulty  finding new jobs.  We are  lowering  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate for workers aged 50-55 to address  this\r\n\r\nproblem.  However, despite this, older workers will leave\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs from time to time, and will often need  extra\r\n\r\nhelp to make the transition to another job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older workers have found it difficult to persuade\r\n\r\nemployers  to hire them, especially in this  current  job\r\n\r\nmarket,  and if they have no track record in a  different\r\n\r\nindustry.   Mr  Nithiah Nandan argued  passionately  that\r\n\r\nbesides feeling for older workers, the Government  should\r\n\r\ntake concrete actions to address their problems. This  is\r\n\r\nprecisely what we have been doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme (or PJTP)\r\n\r\ngives  financial support and incentives to employers,  to\r\n\r\nhelp  local workers in their 40s or older to make  career\r\n\r\ntransitions.    Employers  are   expected   to   set   up\r\n\r\ntraineeship  or  mentorship arrangements  for  their  new\r\n\r\nworkers, besides providing suitable job opportunities  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, 5,000 companies are registered on this\r\n\r\nPJTP programme.  12,000\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nolder  workers, mostly with only secondary  education  or\r\n\r\nbelow,  have  been placed in jobs.  44% of  them,  nearly\r\n\r\nhalf, have stayed on with their employers, even after the\r\n\r\nsalary  support  ended.  This shows that the  scheme  has\r\n\r\nbeen  effective in helping the older workers to find  new\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the success of the PJTP programme, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  extend the programme for  another  year\r\n\r\nuntil  31st  December 2004, and will commit  another  $36\r\n\r\nmillion to finance it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Work Assistance Programme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, we will do more to help the unemployed.\r\n\r\nUnemployment numbers may go up for the next  six  months,\r\n\r\neven  though  the economy is showing signs  of  recovery.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, unemployment should start to come down,  but\r\n\r\nwith  restructuring continuing, we cannot  expect  to  go\r\n\r\nback  to  the 1% unemployment rate that we used to  enjoy\r\n\r\nbefore  the 1997 Asian financial crisis, at a  time  when\r\n\r\nour  economy  was growing rapidly, and restructuring  was\r\n\r\nnot  yet  a  problem and, if I may add, when our  workers\r\n\r\nwere all much younger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng suggested a $2,000 unemployment\r\n\r\nbenefit.  I am sure unemployed workers will welcome this,\r\n\r\nbut  the  danger of course is that even employed  workers\r\n\r\nwill  welcome this because surely, it will encourage many\r\n\r\nmore  people to become unemployed to collect the  $2,000!\r\n\r\nWe  have seen it happened repeatedly, most recently  with\r\n\r\nour  Economic Downturn Relief Scheme.  If there is  money\r\n\r\nbeing  distributed, people will queue  up  for  it.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  to take a different and  more  practical\r\n\r\napproach: we will go the extra mile to help you, but  you\r\n\r\nhave  to  be prepared to help yourself to get a  job  and\r\n\r\nimprove your skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been providing help through the Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment Councils (CDCs). The CDCs provide  short-term\r\n\r\nrelief to individuals and families in temporary hardship,\r\n\r\nsuch  as when their sole breadwinner is retrenched.  They\r\n\r\nadminister an interim financial assistance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscheme  which has been quite successful - it is flexible,\r\n\r\nit  is  targeted, it is sensitive.  The CDCs  can  assess\r\n\r\nwhether  a  case  is  deserving, whether  he  is  helping\r\n\r\nhimself,  whether he bought a big screen TV to watch  the\r\n\r\nWorld Cup, or whether he is struggling because he is  out\r\n\r\nof  a  job  and really needs to provide for his children.\r\n\r\nAnd the CDCs can adjust their assistance correspondingly.\r\n\r\nThey  have  the sensitivity and flexibility to  customise\r\n\r\ntheir assistance and personalise it and distinguish those\r\n\r\nwho  really  need help from those who should be  able  to\r\n\r\nfend for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last financial year, the CDCs together spent\r\n\r\n$3.3  million  helping  some  10,000  people  under  this\r\n\r\nscheme.    Within six months, 97% of the people who  were\r\n\r\nhelped no longer needed assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen their efforts to help the unemployed,\r\n\r\nthe  CDCs  will  launch a new programme called  the  Work\r\n\r\nAssistance  Programme (WAP). This will provide  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  to unemployed Singaporeans and  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  help them to find jobs.  So there are two connected\r\n\r\nlimbs - financial assistance on the one hand and help  to\r\n\r\nfind job on the other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Assistance Programme will integrate\r\n\r\nemployment assistance with the current interim assistance\r\n\r\nscheme  administered by the CDCs. It will  focus  on  low\r\n\r\nincome  individuals who are fit to work.  The  amount  of\r\n\r\nassistance   will  vary  depending  on  each  applicant's\r\n\r\ncircumstance,  but  generally will not  exceed  $400  per\r\n\r\nmonth.    Besides  cash,  the  family  may  also  receive\r\n\r\ntargeted  support, for example, schooling assistance  for\r\n\r\nchildren or a utilities grant. Such targeted support will\r\n\r\naddress the most pressing needs of the family, and ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  assistance  is put to good  use.   This  is  a\r\n\r\npractical problem.  If you take a purist approach, when I\r\n\r\ngive  you help, I should give you money because it is  up\r\n\r\nto  you what to do with the money, and you must know what\r\n\r\nyou are doing.  But MPs know that in real life, that does\r\n\r\nnot  always work because if we give money to him, he  may\r\n\r\nhave a party and tomorrow, he will queue up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagain.   It happens.  You can give it to his wife  or  to\r\n\r\nhis  children, but you really do not want to get involved\r\n\r\nin  his  family's  life.   So we will  give,  in  effect,\r\n\r\nvouchers,  either  for  transport, school  textbooks,  or\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment,  to make sure that  the  most  urgent\r\n\r\nfamily needs are seen to first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In return for the assistance, beneficiaries will\r\n\r\nhave  to  fulfil specific conditions.  They must actively\r\n\r\nseek  work.  They must attend all job interviews arranged\r\n\r\nfor  them,  undergo training to acquire  new  skills  and\r\n\r\naccept  any reasonable job offer.  If they fail to secure\r\n\r\njobs within three months, then we will assign them a case\r\n\r\nmanager,   who   will  provide  more   intensive   career\r\n\r\ncounselling  and  help them overcome any  impediments  to\r\n\r\nsecuring a job. The financial help will last for three to\r\n\r\nsix  months,  because  within that time  most  recipients\r\n\r\nshould be able to get back to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes an individual may fulfil his obligations\r\n\r\nand  cooperate with his case manager and try his best and\r\n\r\nyet not find a job.  For such exceptional cases, the CDCs\r\n\r\nmay  consider extending the assistance beyond six months.\r\n\r\nWe  need  to focus our help on those who are doing  their\r\n\r\nbest  to  help  themselves, and not allow the  scheme  to\r\n\r\nbecome an automatic handout from the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some Singaporeans who are unfit to work\r\n\r\nbecause  of illnesses or disability.  The CDCs will  also\r\n\r\ncontinue to give them assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If unemployment goes up over the next few months,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  possible, more unemployed  workers  will  need\r\n\r\nhelp.   Therefore the Government will help  the  CDCs  to\r\n\r\nexpand their Work Assistance Programme.  We will allocate\r\n\r\n$40   million  for  this  purpose.   However,  the   most\r\n\r\nimportant thing is for those who find themselves out of a\r\n\r\njob not to lose heart, but to try to get back to work  as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible.  The longer a worker is out of work,\r\n\r\nthe harder it will be to get restarted again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Training for Employment Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, to provide further help for unemployed\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  the Government will pilot a  new  Training\r\n\r\nfor  Employment  Scheme to facilitate the employment  and\r\n\r\ntraining  of  local  workers.   Under  this  scheme,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Workforce  Development  Agency   -   the   new\r\n\r\nstatutory  board which MOM is setting up   -   will  help\r\n\r\ncompanies which have 20 or more job vacancies recruit and\r\n\r\ntrain local workers.  This way, companies will be able to\r\n\r\ndeploy  workers to the job more quickly and  the  workers\r\n\r\nwill be better-trained for the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will set aside $2 million for the\r\n\r\nscheme,  which  will run for one year  from  1st  October\r\n\r\n2003.   This  will be used to absorb 80% of the  training\r\n\r\ncost  of  the workers.  As a partner in this scheme,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  National Employers Federation  will  absorb  a\r\n\r\nfurther 10% of the training cost for its members, so that\r\n\r\nthe  employer  only pays 10%.  We must  have  that  small\r\n\r\nemployer  contribution because if  the  employer  is  not\r\n\r\nprepared to pay to train their workers, it will  feel  no\r\n\r\nobligation  to employ the workers.  And in  three  months\r\n\r\nthe workers would have forgotten what they learnt and the\r\n\r\ntraining  would go down the drain.  So we must have  that\r\n\r\ncommitment from the worker and also from the employer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>More for older workers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, we will look after the older workers. Mr\r\n\r\nNithiah  Nandan  does  not like the  phrase.   Perhaps  I\r\n\r\nshould say we will look after those aged around 50-55 and\r\n\r\nthereabouts,  but it will include him.  The restructuring\r\n\r\nof  the  economy,  and especially the CPF  changes,  will\r\n\r\naffect older workers the most.  Wage restructuring  often\r\n\r\nmeans  lowering wages for older workers, who are  at  the\r\n\r\ntop  of  their  salary scales.  They will experience  the\r\n\r\nsteepest CPF cuts to help them hold on to their jobs.  We\r\n\r\nare  cushioning  the impact on them  by  phasing  in  the\r\n\r\nreduction  in  their CPF rates for them over  two  years.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is still going to be difficult for these\r\n\r\nworkers.   And I think these are the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers who are the most concerned, because they so often\r\n\r\nhave the heaviest family obligations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to proceed with the changes, but we will not\r\n\r\nforget  the older workers who are hardest hit by economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring  and who have made a very big  contribution\r\n\r\nto bringing us where we are today.  So, the next time the\r\n\r\nGovernment  implements surplus sharing schemes,  we  will\r\n\r\nespecially remember this group of older workers, and will\r\n\r\ngive them something extra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Help for businesses</i></b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, besides helping individuals, we will also do\r\n\r\nmore  to  help  businesses.  Two sectors especially  need\r\n\r\nassistance:   first,   the   small   and   medium   local\r\n\r\nenterprises,  and,  secondly, the tourism  and  transport\r\n\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Assistance to local enterprises</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small and medium local enterprises form a\r\n\r\nsignificant part of the economy.  They employ  more  than\r\n\r\nhalf the workforce and make up more than 90% of the total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  enterprises.  We will help  them  to  upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir capabilities and cope with the current slowdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>International Enterprise Incentive Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng Chee How rightly pointed out that besides\r\n\r\ncutting costs, companies must pursue the right strategies\r\n\r\nto grow their businesses and so create more jobs.  If you\r\n\r\nare  just  a  cost cutter, you are not going to  grow  an\r\n\r\nempire.  You need to watch your costs, but you also  need\r\n\r\nto  grow your business and seize new opportunities.   You\r\n\r\nneed to move ahead and then your business will grow.   So\r\n\r\nwe  have  to  see the rise of the regional economies  not\r\n\r\nonly  as  a  major  challenge, but also  as  an  enormous\r\n\r\nopportunity.   Our  companies  should  respond  to   this\r\n\r\nopportunity by venturing abroad to ride on the growth  of\r\n\r\nour  neighbours, such as China and India.  The Government\r\n\r\nwill step up its efforts to help companies to do so.  The\r\n\r\nTrade\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Incentive   Scheme   has   therefore   been\r\n\r\nrelaunched  and  we  will make it  as  the  International\r\n\r\nEnterprise Incentive Scheme with a budget of $90  million\r\n\r\nover  three  years,  from  FY2003  to  FY2005.  The   new\r\n\r\nInternational  Enterprise  Incentive  Scheme  will   help\r\n\r\ncompanies develop new markets, build internationalisation\r\n\r\ncapabilities,  and  encourage  Singapore   companies   to\r\n\r\nventure abroad as a cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Domestic Sector Productivity (DSP) Fund</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we have set up a $45 million Domestic Sector\r\n\r\nProductivity  Fund  to help industries  like  retail  and\r\n\r\nconstruction     upgrade    their    productivity     and\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  These sectors lag significantly  behind\r\n\r\nthe  developed countries in productivity.  And it is  one\r\n\r\nreason  why  they  cannot pay as well and  therefore  are\r\n\r\nunable to attract Singaporean workers.  So we will set up\r\n\r\na  Domestic  Sector  Productivity Fund,  administered  by\r\n\r\nSPRING  Singapore, to co-fund industry-wide  projects  to\r\n\r\ncatalyse  improvements in business strategies, operations\r\n\r\nand   practices.   The  aim  is  to  encourage   domestic\r\n\r\nindustries  to  exploit economies  of  scale,  adopt  new\r\n\r\ntechnologies, and improve inter-organisational efficiency\r\n\r\nthrough standardisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Second Tranche of Loan Insurance Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems that SMEs face is access to\r\n\r\nfinancing.   Last  year, we piloted  the  Loan  Insurance\r\n\r\nScheme    (LIS)   with   six   participating    financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   Under the scheme, the  Government  shares\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of the insurance premium against loan default.\r\n\r\nThe  scheme  has been well received and has  helped  many\r\n\r\nSMEs.   To  date,  the scheme has helped  to  insure  $16\r\n\r\nmillion  worth of loans.  We will launch a second tranche\r\n\r\nof  the  Loan  Insurance Scheme.  This will involve  more\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions and should be able to  facilitate\r\n\r\nabout $500 million in loans to SMEs over five years.   It\r\n\r\nwill cost the Government $8 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Local Enterprise Finance Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we have progressively enhanced the\r\n\r\nLocal Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS) to help SMEs  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  challenging economic conditions.  The  changes\r\n\r\ninclude  increasing  the  default  risk  borne   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  from 50% to 80% and reducing the  LEFS  fixed\r\n\r\ninterest  rates.   In  view  of  the  continued  economic\r\n\r\nweakness,  we  will  extend  the  LEFS  enhancements  for\r\n\r\nanother  year  till 30th June 2004.  This will  cost  the\r\n\r\nGovernment $25 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Bridging Loan Programme for all SMEs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the SARS outbreak, we introduced a Bridging\r\n\r\nLoan  Programme  under  LEFS  for  tourism-related  SMEs.\r\n\r\nUnder  this  scheme,  each  SME  in  the  tourism-related\r\n\r\nsectors  can  borrow up to S$100,000 of working  capital.\r\n\r\nAs  other  SMEs may also find this programme  useful,  we\r\n\r\nwill now open up the Bridging Loan Programme to all SMEs,\r\n\r\nand this will cost the Government $5 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Helping the tourism and transport sectors</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second group of businesses that need help are\r\n\r\nthose  in  the  tourism and transport  sectors.   Tourist\r\n\r\narrivals  have rebounded strongly since the  low  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond  quarter  of  this year.  By the  end  of  August,\r\n\r\ntourist  volumes should be about 85% of pre-SARS  levels.\r\n\r\nBut  this is partly because the affected industries  have\r\n\r\ncut   hotel   room   rates  and  airfares  significantly.\r\n\r\nAdditional help from the Government will help to speed up\r\n\r\nthe full recovery of the tourism and transport sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tourism Recovery Fund</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will set aside $100 million for a\r\n\r\nTourism Recovery Fund.  This includes the $50 million for\r\n\r\nthe  Global  Recovery  Programme that  Singapore  Tourism\r\n\r\nBoard  announced in June 2003 to bring tourists  back  to\r\n\r\nSingapore through confidence building programmes,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noverseas   travel   promotions  and  global   advertising\r\n\r\ncampaign.   Another $50 million will be used  to  develop\r\n\r\nfour  key  tourism  segments:  leisure  travel,  business\r\n\r\ntravel  and  MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions  and\r\n\r\nexhibitions), healthcare and education services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rebates for non-gazetted hotels</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the SARS relief package, we provided a\r\n\r\nhigher additional property tax rebate of $2,000 plus  30%\r\n\r\nof  the  balance  of  property tax payable  in  2003  for\r\n\r\ngazetted  tourist hotels.  We did not extend it  to  non-gazetted  hotels  because  they  do  not  take  so   many\r\n\r\ntourists,  and we thought they will be okay since  it  is\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  visit  the non-gazetted  hotels.   But\r\n\r\nSingaporeans also did not visit the non-gazetted  hotels.\r\n\r\nSo,  we will extend the rebate on television licence fees\r\n\r\nand  property tax rebates to the non-gazetted  hotels  as\r\n\r\nwell.   These two extensions will be back-dated and  will\r\n\r\nsave the non-gazetted hotels $1 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Statutory life spans of omnibuses and taxis</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus and taxi companies were also badly hit by the\r\n\r\nSARS crisis.  One practical way to help them is to extend\r\n\r\nthe  life  of their fleets and to ease their depreciation\r\n\r\ncosts.  The current statutory life span for omnibuses  is\r\n\r\n15  years,  and  7  years for taxis.   With  advances  in\r\n\r\nvehicle  engineering,  stricter  inspections  and  better\r\n\r\nmaintenance,  these vehicles can stay roadworthy  longer.\r\n\r\nWe  will  therefore extend the statutory  life  spans  of\r\n\r\nomnibuses from 15 to 17 years, and for taxis from 7 to  8\r\n\r\nyears,  with effect from 1st September 2003.   This  will\r\n\r\napply to both existing and new omnibuses and taxis.   Bus\r\n\r\nand  taxi companies are expected to save about $7 million\r\n\r\nand  $10  million  a  year respectively  in  depreciation\r\n\r\nexpense, at no cost to the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Diesel tax rebate for taxis</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diesel tax is imposed on taxis to close the gap\r\n\r\nbetween the fuel cost of diesel-powered taxis and petrol-powered private\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncars.   As  part  of the off-budget package  in  2001,  I\r\n\r\nreduced  the diesel tax for taxis from $5,100 to  $4,700.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Budget  Statement  this  year,  I  extended  the\r\n\r\nreduction  by six months, till the end of 2003.   I  will\r\n\r\nnow  extend  this reduction by another six  months,  till\r\n\r\n30th  June 2004.  This will cost the Government about  $4\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a $2,000 diesel tax rebate which was\r\n\r\ngranted as part of the SARS relief package, but this will\r\n\r\nnot  be  extended beyond 31st December 2003, because  the\r\n\r\nearnings of taxi drivers are now practically back to pre-SARS levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Taxi operator licence fee</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the SARS relief package, the taxi\r\n\r\noperator licence fee of $25 per taxi per month was waived\r\n\r\ntill  31st  December  2003.  LTA has since  reviewed  the\r\n\r\nregulatory  requirements.  To reduce the burden  on  taxi\r\n\r\ncompanies  to the lowest possible level, LTA will  absorb\r\n\r\nmost of its regulatory costs rather than pass them on  to\r\n\r\ntaxi  companies.  Nevertheless, it still needs to  charge\r\n\r\ntaxi companies a small licence fee.  The revised fee will\r\n\r\nbe  0.1%  of the taxi company's annual revenue from  taxi\r\n\r\noperations.  This works out to only about $2.80 per  taxi\r\n\r\nper month, a small fraction of the original $25 fee.  The\r\n\r\nrevised  licence fee will take effect from January  2004.\r\n\r\nThis  is  just  a  small example of how  we  are  keeping\r\n\r\nGovernment rates and fees as low as possible.  It is also\r\n\r\nas  an  example  of  how  we are sensitive  to  feedback.\r\n\r\nBefore  we announced the SARS package and suspended  this\r\n\r\nfee,  we held a dialogue with the taxi drivers.  I  think\r\n\r\nit was Khaw Boon Wan who did it and the taxi drivers gave\r\n\r\nhim  a  real earful on this issue.  They said,  \"You  are\r\n\r\ntaking  $25 per month from me in order to measure me  and\r\n\r\npunish me.\"  We thought that they did have a point and so\r\n\r\nreviewed the fee.  So we will change the rate and we also\r\n\r\nchanged  the basis of charging.  We will charge based  on\r\n\r\nturnover, rather than size of the taxi fleet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Acceleration of infrastructure projects</i></b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next programme that we will be proceeding with\r\n\r\nis acceleration of our infrastructure projects.  The last\r\n\r\nfew   years  have  been  especially  wrenching  for   the\r\n\r\nconstruction   industry.    It   has   experienced   nine\r\n\r\nconsecutive   quarters  of  decline.   In   1997,   total\r\n\r\ncontracts  awarded were worth $24 billion.  By  2002,  it\r\n\r\nhad dropped to $14 billion, nearly half.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This adjustment was inevitable because the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry had to resize and consolidate after\r\n\r\nthe  excesses  of the property boom in  the  1990s.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has not tried to boost the construction sector\r\n\r\nwith   massive  public  works  programmes.   It  is   not\r\n\r\nrealistic  to try to sustain the old levels of  activity.\r\n\r\nAlso  pump-priming will not work in our  small  and  open\r\n\r\neconomy.  However,  it  is worthwhile  to  bring  forward\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  projects  that  we  intend  to  undertake\r\n\r\nanyway  within the few years, provided we can afford  it.\r\n\r\nThis  will  not only help to create some jobs,  but  will\r\n\r\nalso  let us take advantage of the current low prices  to\r\n\r\nget better value for our money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government agencies have identified more than 60\r\n\r\npublic   sector  infrastructure  projects  that  can   be\r\n\r\nadvanced.   In  total, contracts amounting to  more  than\r\n\r\n$600  million will be brought forward and awarded in this\r\n\r\nfinancial  year and the next financial year.   These  are\r\n\r\nprojects  worthy  in themselves, such as development  and\r\n\r\nimprovement  works for roads, schools,  community  clubs,\r\n\r\nparks,  and drainage and sewerage systems.  Most  of  the\r\n\r\nprojects  are  small, and so are likely to benefit  local\r\n\r\ncontractors and create spin-offs for their suppliers.  Mr\r\n\r\nMah  Bow  Tan  will  elaborate on the  measures  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Government's cost-cutting initiatives</i></b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have asked the Government to do its part to\r\n\r\ncut  fees and charges, and not to rely solely on wage and\r\n\r\nCPF  cuts  to  reduce the cost of business.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nlegitimate request.  The public sector is always  looking\r\n\r\nfor ways to cut costs, espe-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncially the Ministry of Finance.  My Ministry has launched\r\n\r\na  civil  service-wide Economy Drive, to review  all  our\r\n\r\ndiscretionary  expenditure.  Everything from  development\r\n\r\nprojects   to  expenditure  on  manpower  to   day-to-day\r\n\r\nexpenses  is  placed  under scrutiny.   We  are  not  yet\r\n\r\nwielding  the  axe  but, we have already  taken  out  the\r\n\r\nmicroscope.   The  idea is not so  much  to  cut  overall\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditure, but to effect savings  which  can\r\n\r\nbe  redirected  to  new initiatives and  higher  priority\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One measure which we should be finalising in the\r\n\r\nnext  two  months is the review of civil service salaries\r\n\r\nfor  new  recruits and in-service officers to bring  them\r\n\r\nmore in line with the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Indranee Rajah and Mrs Fang Ai Lian have called\r\n\r\nfor  a pro-business civil service, one that operates with\r\n\r\nmore  `common sense'.  May I assure all Members, and  the\r\n\r\ntwo  ladies in particular, that common sense  is  not  so\r\n\r\nuncommon  in  the civil service.  There is a  reason  why\r\n\r\nmany  civil  servants enforce rules so strictly.   It  is\r\n\r\nbecause,   at  the  operational  level,  flexibility   to\r\n\r\nexercise  discretion can tempt officers to offer favours.\r\n\r\nSo strict and transparent rules are by design a trademark\r\n\r\nof our honest and clean Government.  You say what you are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  do,  you publish it, and you do  according  to\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members want civil servants to exercise discretion\r\n\r\nin  their  constituents' favour, but they also  want  the\r\n\r\nrules  to  be transparent.  It is hard to have  both.   I\r\n\r\nhave  had  constituents come to me, and I  am  sure  many\r\n\r\nMembers have too, and asked for special favours.  I said,\r\n\r\n\"It  cannot  be done.  This is against the  rule.\"   They\r\n\r\nsaid, \"gao tai qui shou\" - All you have to do is to raise\r\n\r\nyour  hand.  I said, \"If I do it for you, I will have  to\r\n\r\ndo  it  for everybody else.\"  They said, \"Just do it  for\r\n\r\nme.   Do  not  tell anybody.\"  So that  is  why  we  have\r\n\r\ntransparency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that it is good for our civil\r\n\r\nservants to be rigid bureaucrats.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWe  have to make a bigger effort to operate more flexibly\r\n\r\nand  cut  red tape.  We need to increase convenience  and\r\n\r\nreduce costs to businesses and to the general public.  We\r\n\r\nhave  had  some successes, eg, 57 (33%) of  all  the  173\r\n\r\nstatutory declaration requirements by the Government will\r\n\r\nbe  removed by the end of this financial year.   We  have\r\n\r\n173  different types of statutory declarations and we are\r\n\r\ngoing  to chop off one-third of them, and I am sure there\r\n\r\nwill  be  more to go the next time we look at  the  list.\r\n\r\nThere  is a Pro-Enterprise Panel (PEP) whose task  is  to\r\n\r\nfollow  up  on suggestions and complaints from businesses\r\n\r\nto  change  or  remove rules.  Out of a  total  of  1,011\r\n\r\nsuggestions  received thus far, nearly  half  (46%)  have\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted.  So we are quietly making progress,  even\r\n\r\nthough  perhaps  not  quickly  enough  for  MPs.   But  I\r\n\r\nencourage  MPs to write in with their cases and  to  take\r\n\r\ngood  cases up with the Ministers, with me, or the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.   There are many cases which are routine.   MPs\r\n\r\ncan handle 30-40 cases in one long evening.  You may have\r\n\r\nseen  all  these problems before.  But out of 20-30,  one\r\n\r\nhas a unique problem and is a case which you really ought\r\n\r\nto  fight,  and you should do something about it.   Every\r\n\r\ntime I do an MPS, I encounter such cases.  Maybe the more\r\n\r\ndifficult  ones come to look for me, but you have  to  be\r\n\r\nalert  to  spot it and stick a red spot on that case  and\r\n\r\nraise the matter in a non-routine way, and we can get  it\r\n\r\nfixed and get the costs reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to change the mindset of a big\r\n\r\norganisation  like the civil service overnight.   But  by\r\n\r\ndriving this effort right from the top, we send a  signal\r\n\r\nacross  the  service and, over time, this  approach  will\r\n\r\npercolate  down  the  ranks  and  we  will  slowly,   but\r\n\r\nsteadily, clear the red tape away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have called for greater economy and less\r\n\r\nwaste  in  the  civil  service.   Given  that  the   Pro-Enterprise  Panel  has  been  quite  successful,  I  have\r\n\r\ndecided  to set up another group, which I will  call  the\r\n\r\nCut  Waste  Panel.  We have decided to  call  a  spade  a\r\n\r\nspade,    because    otherwise   it    will    lead    to\r\n\r\nmisunderstandings.  It will include members from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  private  and  people sectors.   The  Panel  will  be\r\n\r\nchaired by the Head of Civil Service, who also chairs the\r\n\r\nPEP.   Anyone  who  has  any  suggestion  of  where   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can cut waste or remove frills is welcome  to\r\n\r\nput  the idea to the Cut Waste Panel.  By cutting  waste,\r\n\r\nthe civil service will reduce its cost of operations, and\r\n\r\nthe  lower the cost of operations, the lower the fees can\r\n\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cut Waste Panel cannot cut everything to bare\r\n\r\nbones,  least  of all cut off limbs.  There was  recently\r\n\r\none  newspaper columnist who outdid himself by suggesting\r\n\r\nthat  we should just reduce the size of the civil service\r\n\r\nby  30%,  and therefore no longer need to reduce the  CPF\r\n\r\nrate.   This was a particularly absurd proposal, even  by\r\n\r\nquite  high  standards.  But the Panel  can  demand  that\r\n\r\nunnecessary  costs be cut, unnecessary rules be  removed,\r\n\r\nunnecessary  programmes be stopped, and unnecessary  fees\r\n\r\nand charges be reviewed.  I encourage MPs and members  of\r\n\r\nthe public to contribute actively to both the PEP and the\r\n\r\nCut  Waste Panel, and the more proposals we get, the more\r\n\r\neffective we can be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><b><i>Goods and Services Tax</i></b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PM announced yesterday that the one percent\r\n\r\npoint  increase  in GST scheduled to take  place  on  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary 2004 will proceed as planned.  Let me explain why\r\n\r\nwe cannot delay this increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GST increase is to raise revenue to compensate\r\n\r\nfor  the  cuts  in  the company and personal  income  tax\r\n\r\nrates.   The  Ministry of Finance planned the income  tax\r\n\r\ncuts  on the basis that GST would be raised to 5% on  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary 2003, that means last January.  The phasing in of\r\n\r\nthe  GST  increase  has  already  created  a  significant\r\n\r\nrevenue  shortfall.  A 4% GST rate will not be enough  to\r\n\r\noffset  the lower income tax collections, and we need  to\r\n\r\nremedy this as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our budget this year is very tight. We are likely\r\n\r\nto  run  a  much  bigger deficit this year  than  we  had\r\n\r\nplanned.  Revenues have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncome  down  in  the first half of this  year  because  of\r\n\r\nincome  tax  cuts,  slower  economic  growth  and   SARS.\r\n\r\nBecause  with  SARS,  people stayed home,  they  did  not\r\n\r\nspend,  and  revenues  dropped.   In  the  Straits  Times\r\n\r\nyesterday, one letter writer asked how the Government  is\r\n\r\ngoing to spend its savings arising from the CPF changes - already  looking for hong baos.  To put  the  numbers  in\r\n\r\nperspective, the Government is saving about $175  million\r\n\r\na  year  from the CPF changes.  This year, in the  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  I  had already projected a  deficit  of  $1.2\r\n\r\nbillion.    Now,   with   lower  tax   revenues,   higher\r\n\r\nexpenditures because of SARS, and this new help  package,\r\n\r\neven  if  we  take into account the CPF savings,  we  are\r\n\r\nstill  going to run a deficit of $2.3 billion this  year.\r\n\r\nNext  year,  we  are projecting an even  larger  deficit.\r\n\r\nDeferring the GST will make the deficits even worse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the visceral reaction of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  any tax increase, and especially to any GST increase.\r\n\r\nAt  this  time, any additional burden must be  unwelcome.\r\n\r\nHowever,   we  should  try  to  understand  the   problem\r\n\r\nrationally.  Deferring the GST increase is, in fact,  the\r\n\r\nleast  effective way to help low income Singaporeans.  If\r\n\r\nyour  objective is to help low income Singaporeans,  then\r\n\r\nthe  last thing you want to do is to cut the GST or defer\r\n\r\nthe  increase.  Why do I say that?  Because,  by  design,\r\n\r\nthe  GST  covers almost all types of goods  and  services\r\n\r\nconsumed by all income groups - whether it is an  airline\r\n\r\nticket, a car, food, a haircut, or lawyer's fees -  every\r\n\r\nservice, every good is taxed the same rate.  And most  of\r\n\r\nthe  tax  is paid by the higher income group.  So,  if  I\r\n\r\nhave  a  lower GST, I am giving most of my money back  to\r\n\r\nthe  higher income group who do not need it, and  only  a\r\n\r\nvery  small proportion is going to go to the lower income\r\n\r\ngroup, the unemployed, or the older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you look at it rationally, it is far better to\r\n\r\nproceed with the GST increase so that the Government will\r\n\r\nhave  the  money  and the resources, and  can  use  these\r\n\r\nresources  to target the deserving groups and render  the\r\n\r\nhelp where it is most needed.  Therefore, we will proceed\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  GST increase and we will give out the second tranche\r\n\r\nof ERS shares on 1st January 2004 as planned, to help the\r\n\r\nlow-income families with the transition.  The ERS  shares\r\n\r\nthis time will be $900 million compared to the extra $650\r\n\r\nmillion that we will collect in GST in 2004.  So pressing\r\n\r\non will make nearly all households better off in 2004.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures I have set out will help ease the pain\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans to make the transition, lower the costs\r\n\r\nfor  businesses,  help companies build  capabilities  and\r\n\r\nstimulate demand for the domestic sector.  The Ministries\r\n\r\nwill  be providing further details of the measures  under\r\n\r\ntheir charge over the next few weeks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The help package to Singaporeans and businesses\r\n\r\namounts to about $1 billion.

The latest package of CPF  changes\r\n\r\nis a very difficult decision to make, but it is the right\r\n\r\nstep forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I entered politics in 1985, my first political\r\n\r\nfight was about the CPF.  It was a year of recession  and\r\n\r\nthe  CPF rate then was 50%.  We were in the old Chambers.\r\n\r\nAnd  Dr Toh Chin Chye used to sit where Mr Seng Han Thong\r\n\r\nnow  is,  roughly,  and  he made a  very  fierce  speech,\r\n\r\nopening fire on all aspects of the Government's policies.\r\n\r\nHe was far better than any Opposition MPs.  The next day,\r\n\r\nI  stood  up  and  fired back.  It was one  of  my  first\r\n\r\nspeeches.  I was young, and I took issue with him on  the\r\n\r\nCPF,  amongst other things.  I will read to  you  what  I\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2790</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"What is an overhead? CPF - is that an overhead?\r\n\r\nIs  that  something which the Government takes away  from\r\n\r\nthe  workers?  Or is it something which is  part  of  the\r\n\r\nsalary, which belongs to the workers, something which the\r\n\r\nworkers  use to spend for Medisave, for a house  and  for\r\n\r\nold  age?  CPF is part of the worker's earnings,  and  we\r\n\r\nare proud that we are able to have such a large amount of\r\n\r\nsavings put aside for a house to live in and for old age.\r\n\r\nVery few countries can do this.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I won the argument and we proceeded on\r\n\r\nthat basis, cutting all other rates and charges, but  not\r\n\r\ndisturbing  the CPF because it is workers'  wages.   But,\r\n\r\nover  the  course of the year, as the recession  deepened\r\n\r\nand  as  we discussed the issues in depth at the Economic\r\n\r\nCommittee, I got educated.  People persuaded me  that  we\r\n\r\nhad  to  do something about the CPF.  It was an overhead,\r\n\r\nand  a  cost  to  businesses.  Yes, it is wages,  but  it\r\n\r\ncannot be helped.  So we changed.  The Economic Committee\r\n\r\nrecommended that we cut the CPF to 35%, from  50%.   That\r\n\r\nis  a  15  percentage point cut.  Today, we  are  talking\r\n\r\nabout  a  3  percentage point adjustment.  The Government\r\n\r\naccepted the proposal.  We sold it to the workers and the\r\n\r\nunions,  with a lot of help from Mr Ong Teng Cheong,  who\r\n\r\nwas  then the Secretary-General of the NTUC and also from\r\n\r\nMr  Lim  Boon  Heng,  who was then the Deputy  Secretary-General  of the NTUC.  We had some quite fierce meetings,\r\n\r\nsome closed-doors, some not.  I am sure some of the union\r\n\r\nmembers  will  remember.  But eventually we  sold  it  to\r\n\r\nthem, they were persuaded and the medicine worked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After 1985, we gradually built the CPF back to 40%.\r\n\r\nWe said that this is the long-term target rate and we got\r\n\r\nthere after 6-7 years.  We maintained it at 40% for quite\r\n\r\na long time.  Then came 1998, the Asian financial crisis,\r\n\r\nand  we  cut the rate from 40% overnight to 30%.  It  was\r\n\r\nnot a hard decision either to make or to sell even though\r\n\r\nit  was  a  big  cut,  because the urgency  was  obvious.\r\n\r\nEverybody  could  see  it.  From July,  when  I  was  not\r\n\r\nconvinced about a CPF cut, to November when I had to make\r\n\r\nthe statement to announce a CPF cut, everybody saw the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontagion  spreading and Indonesia running  into  serious\r\n\r\ntrouble.  We had to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thought then that because the crisis was sharp\r\n\r\nand  we  reacted promptly, once the storm had  passed  we\r\n\r\ncould  go back to 40% quickly.  We did not want  to  take\r\n\r\nsix  or seven years, so we made the public commitment  to\r\n\r\ngo back to 40% quickly.  But we could not do it.  We went\r\n\r\nup  to  36%  when we had a good year in 2000,  then  came\r\n\r\n9/11,  SARS  and  so  many other  things.   We  now  find\r\n\r\nourselves in a different situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Economic Review Committee met. One\r\n\r\nof  the items on our agenda was the CPF.  We started  off\r\n\r\ndiscussing  this.   I told Dr Lee Boon  Yang  we  had  to\r\n\r\nreview the CPF.  Dr Lee said, \"Well, we just take a look.\r\n\r\nIf we have to change, we have to change.\"  Neither he nor\r\n\r\nI  was persuaded that it was necessary for us to turn the\r\n\r\nsystem  upside down.  We thought we could look at it  and\r\n\r\nthere  could be some improvements, and that was it.   But\r\n\r\nas  we  discussed  it  at length, and  as  the  situation\r\n\r\nunfolded, we began to understand that we actually  needed\r\n\r\nto  make quite significant changes to the rules on  using\r\n\r\nCPF  for  housing, to the salary ceiling,  to  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers'  contribution rate, and we  had  some  difficult\r\n\r\ndecisions  on  our  hands.  And  one  of  the  issues  we\r\n\r\nconsidered  was  the  40%  contribution  rate,  could  we\r\n\r\nsustain  it?   The  Government  had  made  a  commitment.\r\n\r\nShould the ERC recommend turning back on that commitment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had two choices, either we abandon the commitment\r\n\r\nor  we go up slowly but carefully.  And we know that even\r\n\r\nif  we reached 40%, one day we may have to come back down\r\n\r\nagain.  We did not want to give up so lightly what we had\r\n\r\npromised.  We had a long discussion with the ERC members,\r\n\r\nwith  the  union Members of Parliament, and with  Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nBoon Heng.  Finally, we agreed to maintain the 40% target\r\n\r\nbut to delay the restoration.  Sustaining 40% was at that\r\n\r\ntime not an immediate problem, but as a long-term problem\r\n\r\nwhich we could do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsomething  about  later.  Further, we already  had  major\r\n\r\nchanges  needing to be done, such as the salary  ceiling,\r\n\r\nthe rules on using CPF for housing, contribution rate for\r\n\r\nolder  workers.  So we thought that the changes  we  were\r\n\r\nmaking  were already very drastic, and we should do  what\r\n\r\nwe could, and take another step later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time we were preparing the ERC's final\r\n\r\nreport,  which  was February 2003, we were  getting  more\r\n\r\nconcerned.   The Sub-Committees, including the  CPF  one,\r\n\r\nhave  all  released their reports. We  were  putting  the\r\n\r\npieces together to get the shape of the whole package  of\r\n\r\nrecommendation.  We asked ourselves:  Have  we  gone  far\r\n\r\nenough?  Do we need to make further adjustments?  The CPF\r\n\r\nquestion  popped  up again.  Should  we  change  the  40%\r\n\r\ntarget?   Again, we thought, let us wait.  The  situation\r\n\r\nwas still changing, but let's not make precipitately a U-turn.  Changing the 40% target would take time, we needed\r\n\r\nto study all the implications and prepare the ground.  So\r\n\r\nwe  decided to freeze 36% for two years, and decide  what\r\n\r\nto do next.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even that took a lot of discussions before all ERC\r\n\r\nmembers  accepted it.  That was February this year.   Now\r\n\r\npost-SARS, we have to re-evaluate our position again.  If\r\n\r\nyou look back over the last 12 months, circumstances have\r\n\r\nchanged significantly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Singapore economy is recovering much more\r\n\r\nslowly.  We expected it to pick up end of last year.  But\r\n\r\nit did not.  Now we are hoping for recovery in the second\r\n\r\nhalf of this year.  We hope it does.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, SARS was a further setback. No question\r\n\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the landscape has changed. If you look at\r\n\r\nAmerica,  they have not been growing so well.   They  are\r\n\r\nneither  in  a recession nor booming.  They have  growth,\r\n\r\nbut  no  jobs are created.  It is a jobless  growth.   It\r\n\r\nimpacts us directly because we are not exporting as  much\r\n\r\nto  America.  But also indirectly, are we going  to  have\r\n\r\njobless growth too?  And, finally,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyou  see the trend of migration of white collar jobs from\r\n\r\nAmerica  and  Europe, to China and  India  -  not  bottle\r\n\r\nwashers,  but  doctors, computer programmers,  designers,\r\n\r\naccountants.  That is a different phenomenon  and  it  is\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  happen  to us, and  much  faster  than  we\r\n\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, after SARS, we re-evaluated our position\r\n\r\nand  decided  that  although we  had  been  reluctant  to\r\n\r\nchange, let us change now.  We have to respond.  We  have\r\n\r\nto  send the right signals, then investors will know that\r\n\r\nwe are moving.  And I think we have successfully done so.\r\n\r\nWe  made the statement yesterday, and in the Wall  Street\r\n\r\nJournal  today, there is a long report on page 3  on  our\r\n\r\nCPF  changes.   It  is  a factual report,  but  with  one\r\n\r\nsignificant  paragraph.   It  says,  \"While  the   widely\r\n\r\nexpected  changes  are painful and  could  hurt  consumer\r\n\r\nspending   in  the  housing  sector,  they   signal   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  intention to help companies better  compete\r\n\r\nagainst rivals in China and India.\"  That is exactly what\r\n\r\nwe  are  trying  to do, and what we must convince  people\r\n\r\nthat we are trying to do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are moving now to reposition the CPF to be\r\n\r\nsustainable over the long term.  What rate, we cannot  be\r\n\r\nsure.  Is it 30%?  Is it 36%?  I do not want to lock in a\r\n\r\nrate  because  the conditions are too unpredictable,  too\r\n\r\nuncertain,  too changeable.  But somewhere in there  will\r\n\r\nbe  an appropriate rate and we may have to change it from\r\n\r\ntime  to time, not every year, but when conditions change\r\n\r\nand  we  have  to  respond. But we cannot promise  people\r\n\r\nanything fixed.   Mr Low Thia Khiang said, \" Why are  you\r\n\r\nnot  promising a rice bowl?\"  I was disappointed  he  did\r\n\r\nnot  ask why we are not promising an iron rice bowl.  But\r\n\r\nhe knows even in China there are no iron rice bowls.  And\r\n\r\nif he has one in Singapore, we will buy it from him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the right path forward. From 40% to 33% is\r\n\r\na  big  move  and  so we studied it very  carefully.   We\r\n\r\nstarted studying this in March, immediately after the ERC\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nReport,  because I was worried that we would not be  able\r\n\r\nto  hold the position for very long.  We were not certain\r\n\r\nif we were going to do anything, but I was convinced that\r\n\r\nwe  had better study it.  If we had to do something, then\r\n\r\nat  least  we  would know what would be the implications.\r\n\r\nHow  low  could the contribution go?  How much  would  be\r\n\r\nneeded for housing, for retirement, for medical expenses?\r\n\r\nSo by the time we decided we needed to do something, some\r\n\r\nground work had already been done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when we announced a target range of 30%-36%, we are confident that, at 30%, the majority can\r\n\r\nstill get by, provided we change the withdrawal rules  at\r\n\r\n55.   If  you take money out at 55, whether it is  for  a\r\n\r\ngood  cause, like for your children's overseas education,\r\n\r\nor  for  fun like starting a new home in Batam, we cannot\r\n\r\nafford  it anymore.  If Singaporeans take out that amount\r\n\r\nat 55, they will not have enough to see them through from\r\n\r\n62 to 80, or as PM says, to maybe even 100.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going from a 40% target to 33% actual contribution\r\n\r\nrate is not such a small move.  Of course, some employers\r\n\r\nprefer  to  cut to 30%.  Some workers prefer to  stay  at\r\n\r\n36%.   There are a few who suggested going back  to  40%,\r\n\r\nbut not that many.  But we have to make a judgement.  You\r\n\r\ncannot  calculate this.  It is not a matter of  right  or\r\n\r\nwrong.  It is a feel - how far do you need to go, how far\r\n\r\ncan  you  go,  where do the benefits tail  off,  and  the\r\n\r\nnegatives and the problems, such as the impact on housing\r\n\r\naffordability and on confidence, come on.  And we decided\r\n\r\non  33%.   It  is a collective judgement.  It  is  not  a\r\n\r\nunanimous view.  But it is where we have decided to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after we do this, our wages are still going to\r\n\r\nbe  many multiples of the Chinese and Indian wages.   You\r\n\r\nhave  heard the figures PM cited - we are 15 times China,\r\n\r\n18  times  India, and so on.  But this is not an exercise\r\n\r\nto  match Chinese or Indian wages.  They are trying their\r\n\r\nbest  to  come up and we are trying our best to stay  up.\r\n\r\nAnd if we are too far out of line, we have to adjust.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We always work on the basis that our workers need to\r\n\r\nbe paid more, ought to be paid more and can be paid more,\r\n\r\nprovided our value-added, our efficiency and productivity\r\n\r\nare  there, and our Government is there to generate extra\r\n\r\nvalue  in Singapore.  By putting all the pieces together,\r\n\r\nwe  can  justify  our higher wages.  So although  we  are\r\n\r\nmaking   these   CPF  adjustments  it  is   the   overall\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness that we have to watch closely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will cut the statutory burden, but we will take\r\n\r\nit one step at a time.  We will not become a boiled frog.\r\n\r\nFor  those who have not heard of the boiled frog, let  me\r\n\r\nexplain  the story.  This is a scientific fact.   If  you\r\n\r\ntake a pot of boiling water and you drop a live frog into\r\n\r\nit, it will say \"Ouch!\", it jumps out, and lives.  If you\r\n\r\ntake a pot of cold water and you put a live frog into it,\r\n\r\nit  swims around.  You turn up the fire, the water  warms\r\n\r\nup, it adapts, it continues to swim around.  You turn  up\r\n\r\nthe  fire  a bit higher, it adapts, it swims around  some\r\n\r\nmore, until it is cooked alive.  So that is what it means\r\n\r\nto be a boiled frog.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to us in 1998 was the first scenario.\r\n\r\nBoiling water, sudden crisis, we were in it and we jumped\r\n\r\nout.  We cut CPF contribution rate from 40% to 30%.  What\r\n\r\nis happening now is that we are in warm water and we have\r\n\r\nto decide what we are going to do.  I can tell you we are\r\n\r\nnot  going to be boiled, but we have to judge the  moment\r\n\r\nto   jump  out.   In  the  meantime,  we  have  made  one\r\n\r\nadjustment  to  33%.  And if we have to, we  will  do  it\r\n\r\nagain.  Because we have to watch the situation closely as\r\n\r\nit  changes, month to month, year to year, and  calibrate\r\n\r\nourselves  so  that  we neither over  react,  nor  become\r\n\r\ninured and insensitive to the changes in the environment,\r\n\r\nand then end up boiled alive.  I wanted to contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe  Fabric of a Nation a piece with a green frog on  it,\r\n\r\nbut I was told it was too late.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we may well change further. There is no\r\n\r\ngoing  back  to 40%.  We are also making other  important\r\n\r\nchanges  -  the  withdrawal rule at 55 is  a  very  major\r\n\r\nchange.  All the CPF changes are going to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlead  to  savings of $1.3 billion per year for employers,\r\n\r\nor  about  1%  of GDP.  Each employer may not  save  that\r\n\r\nmuch,  but  for the economy as a whole, it is  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney and it will make a significant difference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen yesterday made a good speech,\r\n\r\nasking  about the Government's money.  He said  that  our\r\n\r\nelectoral cycle does not coincide with the property cycle\r\n\r\nand  does not coincide with the business cycle.  So  when\r\n\r\nthe  market  is up, we sell our land.  When  we  have  an\r\n\r\nelection,  we lock up the money.  After the election,  we\r\n\r\nhave  a  problem.   This  is a  real  issue  but  a  very\r\n\r\ncomplicated one which we are taking some time  to  study.\r\n\r\nWe  will see what, if anything, needs to be done.  But it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  affect  our  immediate policy  decisions.   As\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister, my approach is to set the  appropriate\r\n\r\nfiscal  policy   -  tax levels, spending  levels,  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus or deficit - such that it is appropriate  to  the\r\n\r\nstate  of the economy.  If it needs to be stimulated,  we\r\n\r\nwill  stimulate  it.  If it needs to be cooled  down,  we\r\n\r\nwill  cool  it down.  And if we have to draw on reserves,\r\n\r\nso be it.  If I have to ask the President for approval, I\r\n\r\nwill have to make the case and the President will have to\r\n\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to run deficits in a downturn. Our\r\n\r\npublic expenditure has been counter-cyclical.  Last  year\r\n\r\nwas  a  slow year and we ran a small deficit.  This year,\r\n\r\nwe  are  going to run a much bigger deficit.  As  I  told\r\n\r\nyou,  it  is going to be more than $2 billion.   We  will\r\n\r\nprobably run an even bigger deficit next year in FY 2004.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  we have to go to the President, I think  we  can\r\n\r\nmake  a  good  case.   I  think  he  will  listen  to  it\r\n\r\nrationally and, hopefully, sympathetically.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot draw on reserves to put off essential\r\n\r\nstructural changes.  If our economy is out of kilter,  if\r\n\r\nour  wage structure is wrong, if our CPF system is wrong,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  leave  things be and just live  on  our  past\r\n\r\nsavings.   We have to take a long view, look  beyond  the\r\n\r\npresent and set our policies so that it will work in  the\r\n\r\nlong term.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mind if we run a big deficit this year or\r\n\r\nnext year.  My concern is: can we balance our books after\r\n\r\nthe  economy has recovered?  It is very easy to say  this\r\n\r\nis  a transient problem, which is part and parcel of  the\r\n\r\nautomatic  stabiliser  at work.  But  when  the  economic\r\n\r\nconditions improve and our fiscal situation is  stuck  in\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  position,  then we  will  have  a  structural\r\n\r\ndeficit and a big problem.  Hong Kong has a deficit  that\r\n\r\nis  7% of their GDP, which is a serious matter.  If  that\r\n\r\nhappens  to  us,  investors  will  lose  confidence,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dollar will depreciate, and our  savings  will\r\n\r\nlose  value.   Mr Low Thia Khiang said just now  that  we\r\n\r\ndare  not  depreciate  the  Singapore  dollar,  and   are\r\n\r\ntherefore  cutting the CPF.  I think he is  quite  right.\r\n\r\nWould  he dare to depreciate the Singapore dollar  if  he\r\n\r\ncan  do  so?   To depreciate the Singapore  dollar  means\r\n\r\ninflation  will  go up, workers' savings  will  be  worth\r\n\r\nless, confidence will go down, interest rates will go up,\r\n\r\nand  many  consequences  which I  think  any  responsible\r\n\r\ngovernment  will  have  to think  very  carefully  before\r\n\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if we need to spend now, we will spend.\r\n\r\nBut  we will make sure that when we get back on track and\r\n\r\nthe  economy  is growing, our budget is back in  balance.\r\n\r\nAnd  that is one of the reasons why we cannot put off the\r\n\r\nGST increase further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me talk about the CPF changes. Some\r\n\r\npeople   are   asking  if  these  will   make   Singapore\r\n\r\ncompetitive. Will they work?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF changes are only part of our strategy. We\r\n\r\nhave tackled many other components of our business costs.\r\n\r\nOur  income  tax rates are now one of the lowest  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.    Our   utilities   charges,   despite   people's\r\n\r\ncomplaints,  are  low  compared to other  countries.   In\r\n\r\nother  countries,  where  the  electricity  industry   is\r\n\r\nprotected, once a plant is built, it is guaranteed a rate\r\n\r\nof return.  If the plant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncannot  fetch the target rate of return, the tariffs  are\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we have opened up our market,\r\n\r\nwhich  used  to comprise steam plants.  Then  gas  became\r\n\r\navailable.  A gas plant produces electricity much cheaper\r\n\r\nthan  a  steam plant.  But we did not keep  out  the  gas\r\n\r\nplants  in order to guarantee the steam plants a rate  of\r\n\r\nreturn.  We proceeded to build the gas plants, bought the\r\n\r\ngas,  and now the steam plants are \"stranded\".  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,   their  value  has  gone  down.   The  price   of\r\n\r\nelectricity can no longer cover the full cost to  operate\r\n\r\na  steam  plant.  It is the wrong thing  to  do  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment as a shareholder of the steam plants,  but  we\r\n\r\ndid  it because that is a sensible thing for the economy.\r\n\r\nWe  write-off the value of the steam plants, move to gas,\r\n\r\nand  everybody benefits from cheaper electricity  prices,\r\n\r\nand  the Government's loss as shareholder is the people's\r\n\r\ngain.   Not all Members knew or understood what  we  did.\r\n\r\nFrom  time to time, we get requests - why not just reduce\r\n\r\nthe  utility charges?  It is not so simple.  But what  we\r\n\r\nhave done has been significant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our land cost and rentals have also come down. I\r\n\r\nhave  a  table  (Cols. 2851-2).  May I ask the  Clerk  to\r\n\r\ndistribute  it?  [Copies  of Table  distributed  to  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers.]\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030829/20030829-HA-0762851.pdf\"\">Table - Changes in property and land prices (1994-2003)</a><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had this argument twice with Mr Inderjit Singh.\r\n\r\nHe  is  not here today, so Mr Low Thia Khiang took it  up\r\n\r\nfor  him. But let me show you what the real numbers  look\r\n\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land prices have come down in Singapore\r\n\r\nsignificantly.   If we look back 10 years,  to  just  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of the property upturn in 1994, and index  the\r\n\r\nproperty  prices then as 100.  Today, 10 years  down  the\r\n\r\nroad, JTC flatted factories have gone down to 67, ie, one-third down.  JTC industrial land has gone down to 75, ie,\r\n\r\none-quarter down.  Private industrial factories have gone\r\n\r\ndown to 78 or one-fifth down.  Office, to 59 - about  40%\r\n\r\ndown.   Shops  have gone down to 68, ie, one-third  down.\r\n\r\nResidential has gone down to 76, ie, a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquarter  down.  And if you look at the chart  below,  you\r\n\r\nwill  see  that  the trend has been  down.   And  if  you\r\n\r\ncompare  the decline not from 1994 but from the  peak  at\r\n\r\naround 1996/1997, the decline has been even sharper.   So\r\n\r\nto  say,  \"Let  us bring land prices down\",  is  to  make\r\n\r\nstatements without looking at the facts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to judge Singapore on our overall\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  Wages are important, but they are  part\r\n\r\nof  our overall competitiveness.  The newspapers reported\r\n\r\nDr  Tony  Tan's statement.  Over the weekend, he  made  a\r\n\r\nspeech,  I  think at a Sembawang National Day  observance\r\n\r\nceremony,  and pointed out that a PERC report  said  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  wages appeared to be higher than that  in  the\r\n\r\nUS, which is a serious matter.  But that is only one part\r\n\r\nof  the picture.  We also have to look at the rest of the\r\n\r\npicture to complete the perspective.  If we look  at  the\r\n\r\nPERC  report  which was published on 2nd July  2003,  for\r\n\r\nSingapore, it says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Still competitive compared to Asia's more developed\r\n\r\neconomies,  but  expensive compared  to  most  developing\r\n\r\nones.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a spectrum of economies. If we are a\r\n\r\nproperly developed economy, we are okay.  If we are not a\r\n\r\ndeveloped  country,  we have a problem.   We  are  almost\r\n\r\ndeveloped.  But, compared to the developing economies, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  watch our competitiveness.  The report  further\r\n\r\nexplained that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Singapore Government has historically done a\r\n\r\nvery  good  job  of holding down the rate  of  inflation.\r\n\r\nThis  year is no exception.  It has allowed labour  costs\r\n\r\nto  increase fairly rapidly during boom times, but it has\r\n\r\nalso  allowed them to fall during difficult periods, such\r\n\r\nas  the  island is currently experiencing.  Consequently,\r\n\r\nalthough  consumer prices have risen slightly this  year,\r\n\r\nlabour  costs  have held steady or even  fallen,  helping\r\n\r\ncompanies hold the line on costs.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, overall, we are not wildly out of line. We need\r\n\r\nto  adjust,  but the water is not boiling yet.   We  just\r\n\r\nhave  to  adjust the thermostat.  The report goes  on  to\r\n\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Office and housing rents in Singapore are where the\r\n\r\nisland  has  held  a  big  advantage  over  Asia's  other\r\n\r\ndeveloped economies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large proportion of the population lives in public\r\n\r\nhousing, much larger than in Hong Kong.  This has  helped\r\n\r\nto hold down demand for private sector\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npremises.   Rents  are  still  high  compared   to   most\r\n\r\ndeveloping economies in the region, but not compared with\r\n\r\nthe  developed  economies of Asia,  or  even  with  major\r\n\r\nChinese cities like Shanghai or Beijing.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our rents are high compared to developing\r\n\r\neconomies,  but  not so when compared  to  the  developed\r\n\r\neconomies or even Shanghai and Beijing.  If we  take  the\r\n\r\nwhole  picture in perspective, there is no need to panic.\r\n\r\nBut  we know we have to adjust, that is what we are doing\r\n\r\nand  we  are  sending  the right  signals  to  investors,\r\n\r\ncreating the right investment environment.  With that  we\r\n\r\nare able to create jobs for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we can do this together is an enormous plus.\r\n\r\nThat  we  are  here  seriously discussing  these  issues,\r\n\r\ndebating  them, and have everybody understand what  needs\r\n\r\nto  be  done - is a plus.  Even Mr Low Thia Khiang, after\r\n\r\nquite  a fierce speech, at the end said why not just  fix\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  rate at 35%. That showed a recognition  of  the\r\n\r\nreality.   We  are sitting here debating, not  out  there\r\n\r\njoining a million-man demonstration in Parliament Square.\r\n\r\nThat would be a totally different kind of Singapore.  But\r\n\r\nwhat we do requires the trust of Singaporeans, requires a\r\n\r\nGovernment  which  is resolved to make  vital  structural\r\n\r\nchanges  and then, together, we take the pain and  adjust\r\n\r\ntogether.   Then we would have not just a partnership  in\r\n\r\ngood  times, but a bond that will hold even in bad times,\r\n\r\nand it is because of this that we have confidence that we\r\n\r\ncan tackle the future.

After  the announcement by the Prime Minister  on\r\n\r\nthe CPF reduction, I spoke to some grassroots leaders and\r\n\r\nmy  friends  in the business community.  They  have  some\r\n\r\ncomments on the CPF cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his National Day Rally speech, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ngave  an indication of the direction that we were  going.\r\n\r\nSo  many  people guessed that it would be a 6% reduction.\r\n\r\nBut,  after  giving  much  thought  to  the  matter,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  decided that the cut would be  3%.   I  think\r\n\r\nthat  it  is a very rational decision and it also  proves\r\n\r\nthat the Government is one that cares about the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Deputy Prime Minister has proposed a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive    programme    to    help    Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the lower income and the  older  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The whole package shows that the  Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not  take  this CPF retuning exercise  lightly.   I\r\n\r\nfully  support this reform by the Government, but I would\r\n\r\nlike to make some suggestions.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.25 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation. In fact, some five years ago, we\r\n\r\nthought  that the pace would not be so fast and that  the\r\n\r\nemergence of China and India would not be that fast.  But\r\n\r\nwe  now realise that the whole impact is more much severe\r\n\r\nthan  we thought it would be.  We have to adapt ourselves\r\n\r\nto  this environment, as it is a case of \"survival of the\r\n\r\nfittest\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh has said that we have only two\r\n\r\nchoices:  either we go on a drastic reform, or just  keep\r\n\r\nto  our  old ways and gradually go downhill.   The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  picked the first method, ie, to  undertake\r\n\r\ndrastic reform to our system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about competition, we have to, first of all,\r\n\r\ntalk about cost competitiveness,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsecondly, on efficiency and competitiveness and, thirdly,\r\n\r\ncompetition in our living environment, ie, to be  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  best places to live, work and play.  We want to make\r\n\r\nour talented people in Singapore feel that Singapore is a\r\n\r\ngood place to live in and we also want to attract foreign\r\n\r\ntalents to come and work and live here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two days, we have been talking about\r\n\r\ncost  competitiveness, and two Ministers have given us  a\r\n\r\nvery clear picture of the situation.  Yes, we want to cut\r\n\r\ncost,  but  it  does  not  mean that  we  want  to  bring\r\n\r\nourselves down to the level of China or India.   In  this\r\n\r\ncompetition,  yes, we want to tighten our belts,  but  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean  that  we want to drastically  lower  our\r\n\r\nstandard  of living.  Perhaps, some people's standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  may have stagnated, and some of them may continue\r\n\r\nto  go higher and some may go lower.  But economists  who\r\n\r\nhave  studied  the  matter advised that  if  we  were  to\r\n\r\npurchase   the  cheaper  products  from  the   developing\r\n\r\ncountries and adjust our lifestyle a little, then perhaps\r\n\r\nour standard of living would not go down so fast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an unavoidable fact before us, ie, we would\r\n\r\nhave to face these three types of situation in Singapore.\r\n\r\nSome people's standard of living may be stagnated at  the\r\n\r\npresent  level; some people may be affected.  We have  to\r\n\r\nbe  psychologically prepared that we will not be able  to\r\n\r\ngrow  so  fast  like in the past.  We  need  to  do  some\r\n\r\nadjustments  to our choice of housing, the  car  we  use,\r\n\r\nand  our consumption pattern.  A number of Ministers have\r\n\r\nmentioned that in some developed countries, even  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States,  the standard of living of  some  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  is  affected.  In some less developed  countries,\r\n\r\nmaybe  China  and India, we can see that the standard  of\r\n\r\nliving   has  been  going  up.   But  in  the   developed\r\n\r\ncountries, many people's standard of living has  actually\r\n\r\ngone down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Minister Lim Boon Heng and Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Lee had mentioned about what the CDCs could  do\r\n\r\nto help.  I am very glad to report to our colleagues\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhere  that  in  the  past one year, we  have  been  quite\r\n\r\nsuccessful in our efforts to help our residents  who  are\r\n\r\naffected by the recession to look for jobs. We have  made\r\n\r\nuse  of some of the packages introduced by MOM.  We  have\r\n\r\nalso gone down to the factories. We have trained some  of\r\n\r\nthe workers to upgrade their skills or to retrain them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July, there were 4,800 unemployed who have\r\n\r\nregistered  themselves with our South West CDC.  We  have\r\n\r\nsuccessfully secured interview opportunities for  60%  of\r\n\r\nthe  job-seekers.  A total of 1,235 actually took up  the\r\n\r\njobs that were given to them, among whom 588 are 40 years\r\n\r\nand  above. So the older workers were also able  to  find\r\n\r\njobs  so  long  as they are willing to be more  flexible.\r\n\r\nOut of 1,235 jobs, 374 or about 29% were lower-paid ones,\r\n\r\nand our local residents were prepared to take these jobs.\r\n\r\nSo  long  as we give them some encouragement,  give  them\r\n\r\nsome  skills training and some guidance, we can  persuade\r\n\r\nthem to take the jobs available to them.  For example, we\r\n\r\ncooperated  with the hospitals to train the older  female\r\n\r\nworkers  to  do some cleaning work in the hospitals.   We\r\n\r\nbrought  them  to Alexandra Hospital and KK Hospital  and\r\n\r\nthe success rate was quite high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had not held their hands and encouraged them\r\n\r\nand  just  told them to go to KK Hospital or  the  mental\r\n\r\nhospital, they would be worried and may not even turn  up\r\n\r\nfor  interview.  But when we bring them to the hospitals,\r\n\r\nhave  tea  with  them  there and explained  to  them  the\r\n\r\nsituation,  they will be more receptive  and  willing  to\r\n\r\nwork  there.   We  even brought them to  the  handicapped\r\n\r\nchildren's homes.  At first, they were not willing to go.\r\n\r\nBut  if you hold their hands, arrange to have people from\r\n\r\nthe  hospitals to explain the job requirements  to  them,\r\n\r\nthey would respond positively. We discovered that many of\r\n\r\nthem  who  went to the home for the handicapped children,\r\n\r\nfelt  that the children were very appreciative  of  their\r\n\r\nattendance  there and they cultivated a  love  for  these\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as a CDC, we will help to cooperate with MOM and\r\n\r\nthe employers to arrange\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  training, particularly for the older workers, and  I\r\n\r\ncan see that we are getting better results nowadays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the cost factor, yesterday, we talked only\r\n\r\nabout  CPF.  But  today, the Deputy  Prime  Minister  had\r\n\r\nintroduced  various packages to help the  people.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that  both the employers and workers would  welcome\r\n\r\nthese  packages.  But some people I spoke  to  feel  that\r\n\r\ncompanies  which  are not linked to   globalisation,  for\r\n\r\nexample,   our  energy  companies,  utilities  companies,\r\n\r\npublic  transport companies, and are not affected by  the\r\n\r\nglobal  competition, are also enjoying the 3% savings  on\r\n\r\nCPF.   These companies should share the benefit of  these\r\n\r\nsavings with their customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would also like to see how the Government could\r\n\r\ncut  down on all those bureaucratic red tapes.  Recently,\r\n\r\nthe  Government introduced \"e-Government\" which is a very\r\n\r\ngood   initiative.   We  can  now  provide  the   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  with a \"one-stop\" service.  I feel  that  this\r\n\r\none-stop service should not be confined to the MNCs.   We\r\n\r\nshould  extend this one-stop service to all the  services\r\n\r\nand the various industries, including the local SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of one old lady in our constituency who works\r\n\r\non  a  sewing  machine in the market and she  offers  the\r\n\r\nservice  of  clothing alteration for her  customers.   It\r\n\r\ntook  me  10  years to get her a licence to run  a  small\r\n\r\nstall  at  the  market place.  Over the  years,  all  her\r\n\r\napplications  were  rejected because the  officials  said\r\n\r\nthat there was no such precedent, and clothing alteration\r\n\r\nwas  not one of the skills specified in their manual  for\r\n\r\napproval  of  a  vocation licence.  I  think  if  one  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to  be  self-reliant, we should  make  it  more\r\n\r\nconvenient  and even encourage one to earn  a  living  by\r\n\r\nusing  one's skills, so long as it is legal,  proper  and\r\n\r\ncause  no harm to the country.  We do not want retrenched\r\n\r\npeople  to  queue  up for handouts.  We should  encourage\r\n\r\nthese people, make it more convenient for them to earn  a\r\n\r\nliving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  their skills or special talents so that they  could\r\n\r\nearn  enough  to support themselves.  I think  we  should\r\n\r\nencourage  them to take up these jobs as  well  as  micro\r\n\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also a lot of small and medium enterprises\r\n\r\n(SMEs)  in Singapore. When we talk about SMEs, it usually\r\n\r\nmeans  those with a paid-up capital of $1 million, or  at\r\n\r\nleast  $500,000.   But there are some older  workers  who\r\n\r\nhave no means to start a business of that size, and it is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult for them to be trained or  re-skilled.  I\r\n\r\nthink we should encourage them to do some small trades so\r\n\r\nthat  these  people can earn a living for themselves.   I\r\n\r\nthink  SPRING Singapore should consider encouraging  this\r\n\r\nsort of small businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some developed countries, like the United States,\r\n\r\nthey  have  also  promoted this  type  of  small  trades.\r\n\r\nCapital loans of $10,000 or so are readily available  for\r\n\r\nthe older folks to start their small businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to mention is that in our South\r\n\r\nWest  CDC, we promised our residents that no child  would\r\n\r\nbe deprived of the opportunity to be placed in childcare,\r\n\r\nkindergarten, student care and be educated simply because\r\n\r\nhis  or  her  parents  have  financial  difficulties.   A\r\n\r\nChildren's Fund has been set up to see to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister mentioned the Home Ownership Plus\r\n\r\nEducation (HOPE) Scheme.  We hope that we would  be  able\r\n\r\nto promote this scheme to the families who have financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties so that the children would not  be  deprived\r\n\r\nof  the opportunity to be educated.  We should give  this\r\n\r\nassurance  to the residents that their children  will  be\r\n\r\nlooked after.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, DPM had also mentioned that he hoped that\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  could relax their rules.  I think Minister  Mah\r\n\r\nand  his  ministry officials are very active  people.  We\r\n\r\nhave  taken up quite a bit of issues concerning HDB rules\r\n\r\nto them, and these\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nissues were settled expeditiously through the efforts  of\r\n\r\nMinister  Mah and his officials.  I hope in this  aspect,\r\n\r\nwe   could  accelerate  the  exercise  to  simplify   the\r\n\r\nprocedures so that it would be easier for the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the long term, we cannot just depend on wage\r\n\r\ncuts.   Minister Lim Boon Heng had recalled several  wage\r\n\r\nreforms that we have undertaken over the years.  And just\r\n\r\nnow,  Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Hawazi had also  talked\r\n\r\nabout  companies where the employees are  not  unionised,\r\n\r\nless  than  10% of these employers have adopted  flexible\r\n\r\nwage system.  We, the labour MPs, have been advocating  a\r\n\r\nflexible  wage system for the past 18 years, and  yet  so\r\n\r\nfew  of  these  employers have  heeded  our  advice.   So\r\n\r\nperhaps,  I  should offer two suggestions to improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  One is to grant some tax incentives to  those\r\n\r\nwho  adopt a flexible wage system.  Maybe it is too  late\r\n\r\nfor  this round of CPF cut.  But I hope that there  would\r\n\r\nnever   be  another  round  of  CPF  cut.   But  in   the\r\n\r\nunfortunate event that this happens again, I think  those\r\n\r\ncompanies which do not have a flexible wage system should\r\n\r\nnot  be  allowed  to  enjoy  any  reduction  in  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution. This way, we can encourage these  companies\r\n\r\nto quickly adopt a flexible wage system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, I visited a company known as Ameron. I\r\n\r\nwas  told that the company has been making profits  every\r\n\r\nyear  since  1998.   This  year, they  have  enjoyed  the\r\n\r\nhighest profits ever.  So originally, in my speech, I was\r\n\r\nsupposed to tell their workers to tighten their belts and\r\n\r\nto exercise wage reform.  But when I heard their results,\r\n\r\nI held back and asked the CEO how did they manage to have\r\n\r\nprofits  every  year despite the economic  downturn.   He\r\n\r\ntold  me  that  they make sure everybody in the  company,\r\n\r\nfrom   the   senior  mangers  to  the  factory   workers,\r\n\r\nunderstands  the  competition they are facing,  and  they\r\n\r\nhave therefore to adapt to changes.  Everyone should make\r\n\r\na  contribution at his own level and, if necessary,  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices too.  The company guarantees that its products\r\n\r\nmust  be 100% accurate - because their products are  used\r\n\r\nin deep seas for oil exploration - there should not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  any  defects in the quality.  Another factor  is  the\r\n\r\nspeed.  The products must be able to deliver on time.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  that  his  company  was very  happy  to  invest  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and that the workers here were good.   But  he\r\n\r\ncommented that the younger workers normally do  not  stay\r\n\r\nin  their job for long.  They would work for one  or  two\r\n\r\nmonths and resign.  But the older workers have worked for\r\n\r\nmore  than  10  years  because they know  that  when  the\r\n\r\ncompany makes money, they will be given bonuses and a lot\r\n\r\nof  benefits, but the younger workers work for one or two\r\n\r\nmonths and they quit, because the working hours are long.\r\n\r\nSo,  I  think we should not just be concerned  with  wage\r\n\r\ncuts.  We should help ourselves by upgrading ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been retrenchments in some big companies\r\n\r\nlike  PSA  Corp.   We know that PSA Corp  aims  to  be  a\r\n\r\nglobalised group of companies.  It ranks very high up  in\r\n\r\nthe  world.   It is one of the best ports in  the  world.\r\n\r\nRecently, we also visited the Keppel Offshore and  Marine\r\n\r\nCompany.   The company has invested heavily  in  research\r\n\r\nand  development.   They  are the  world  leader  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing of jack-up rigs.  In fact, some 60% of  all\r\n\r\nthe jack-up cranes in the world were constructed by them.\r\n\r\nSo  we should not feel depressed.  If we have a long-term\r\n\r\nplan,  we will still be able to maintain our standard  of\r\n\r\nliving or even enjoy a better standard of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the issue of training, I still have some\r\n\r\nreservations.   Some  20  years  ago,  Dr  Tay  Eng  Soon\r\n\r\npromoted  the WISE and BEST programmes, but the  response\r\n\r\nwas not too good.  Even now, many workers in the 40s have\r\n\r\ndifficulty undergoing training because of their  lack  of\r\n\r\nlinguistic and mathematical aptitude.  Twenty years  ago,\r\n\r\nwhen  these programmes were launched, these workers  were\r\n\r\nabout 25 years old.  Twenty years later, they are now  45\r\n\r\nyears  old. There are real problems in training them.  We\r\n\r\nshould  sit down and study where the problem is.   Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause the workers refuse to be trained or the employers\r\n\r\nare  not proactive in wanting to train them?  So, for  20\r\n\r\nyears, this generation of people are already moving into\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmiddle age.  I hope that for those who are 25 years  old,\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  have  the same problem  20  years  later  in\r\n\r\nParliament.   So I think we should really  sit  down  and\r\n\r\nsystematically analyse this problem as to how to  enhance\r\n\r\nour competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, I mentioned about PSA. I asked them how\r\n\r\nwe could further improve the productivity of our workers.\r\n\r\nThey  told  me that they do not have a problem  with  the\r\n\r\nfacilities.    They  have  the  capital   to   meet   the\r\n\r\nrequirements.  The problem is how to let our workers work\r\n\r\nin  a wiser manner.  They are hardworking, but how do  we\r\n\r\ntrain  them  so  that they can work smart and  provide  a\r\n\r\nhigher level of service.  This would involve training and\r\n\r\nequipping    them   with   proficiency   in    languages,\r\n\r\nmathematics, and the use of computers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Prime Minister mentioned that many\r\n\r\noffice jobs have been relocated to other places.  I think\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  serious  problem.  We should  sit  down  and\r\n\r\nconduct some in-depth studies and analyse the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to talk about our fighting\r\n\r\nspirit.   The  Prime Minister had mentioned that  in  the\r\n\r\npast,  Singapore  was  able to counter  all  difficulties\r\n\r\nbecause our people had the fighting spirit and the spirit\r\n\r\nof  unity.   I hope that our people should not  be  down-hearted.   Our basic infrastructure is good.  Our  system\r\n\r\nof  government, strong reserves and transparency  in  our\r\n\r\nsystem  are our forte.  So, the most important  thing  is\r\n\r\nthat  we must lift up our fighting spirit like what Mayor\r\n\r\nHeng Chee How had mentioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of my residents said that I was speaking for\r\n\r\nthe  employers.  I said, \"No, we are speaking for all the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore.\"  Maybe the employers  should  say\r\n\r\nmore.   It seems that all the time, it was the Government\r\n\r\nand the trade union leaders who are speaking up.  I think\r\n\r\nthe  employers themselves should also speak up.   We  are\r\n\r\nspeaking  for the general good of the people so  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  break through this present economic dark cloud.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, we have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noften heard that a large number of potential jobs may  be\r\n\r\nlost  in  Singapore as more companies contemplate  moving\r\n\r\ntheir  operations  to countries that  have  lower  labour\r\n\r\ncosts.  This, I believe, is unavoidable.  Among the ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries, the attraction of lower labour costs, such  as\r\n\r\nin  Indonesia, Malaysia and other neighbouring countries,\r\n\r\nis irresistible to investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many businesses in Singapore, whether local or\r\n\r\nforeign,  have  been and are still producing  traditional\r\n\r\ngoods  and services that provide employment for  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber of people.  Their products are of high quality and\r\n\r\nsome  may  even have the potential of expanding  overseas\r\n\r\nwith  their products.  However, they are currently facing\r\n\r\nheavy competition from overseas companies with lower cost\r\n\r\nof  operations,  and  especially those  that  are  labour\r\n\r\nintensive  may  be  forced to cease  operations  here  if\r\n\r\nnothing is done about the cost of labour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the Government recognises\r\n\r\nthis  problem and that the Prime Minister is  now  taking\r\n\r\naction  to remove one of the financial obstacles  in  the\r\n\r\npath  of  businesses, and that is the high statutory  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rate for employers.  The  current  rate  of\r\n\r\nemployer's  contribution  rate  of  16%  has   not   been\r\n\r\nsustainable  for a long period of time, and has  been  an\r\n\r\ninflexible  reward  instrument for employers  to  use  in\r\n\r\nmanaging their payroll.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility has now been brought into the formula by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  to make CPF  contribution  move  in\r\n\r\ntandem with the economic climate.  This move, I note,  is\r\n\r\na  significant signal to employers that the Government is\r\n\r\nserious about creating a robust economy.  And the  relief\r\n\r\nmeasures   that  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has   just\r\n\r\nannounced  will further make our economy more nimble  and\r\n\r\naggressive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister of State Raymond Lim has also acknowledged\r\n\r\ntoday that competition in many industries -  and it is  a\r\n\r\ncommon\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrend  now   -   has forced prices down and  margins  are\r\n\r\nunder  tremendous pressure as fixed overhead cost remains\r\n\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lowering of the CPF rate from 16% to 13%\r\n\r\nfor   employer's   contribution,  overheads   will   drop\r\n\r\ntremendously for companies, and especially so  for  those\r\n\r\nthat  are labour intensive, allowing them to match  lower\r\n\r\nprices  and  keep  the business going and  thus  preserve\r\n\r\njobs.   In  fact, some of the savings in CPF contribution\r\n\r\nwill  be  a  saving grace for companies that  are  facing\r\n\r\nlosses.   For  those  companies that will  enjoy  greater\r\n\r\nmargin  in their profit statements, staff bonuses  should\r\n\r\nbe encouraged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saving jobs in an economic downturn is the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   primary  objective  and   attracting   new\r\n\r\ninvestments and creating a conducive business environment\r\n\r\nfor  business  to  trade will be on top  of  the  agenda.\r\n\r\nWithout  jobs, there will be no CPF contribution for  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  Therefore, as Government adapts to the changing\r\n\r\nenvironment to save jobs, so must the people.  This  will\r\n\r\ninclude a mindset change as to how we perceive the amount\r\n\r\nthat should be in the retirement fund.  A fair amount  of\r\n\r\nsavings  has  to be set aside for the future.   But  with\r\n\r\ninflation, CPF savings will not be sufficient to meet old\r\n\r\nage  requirements when a person retires.  So what  future\r\n\r\nquantum  should  this  fair  amount  be?   Should  it  be\r\n\r\n$120,000  as the Minimum Sum or more?  It all depends  on\r\n\r\nthe  standard of living that one desires.  It may not  be\r\n\r\nattainable but whatever the amount is, the future rate of\r\n\r\nsavings  in  the CPF should be an affordable  amount  for\r\n\r\nboth the employers and employees, that should be flexible\r\n\r\nenough to move in line with economic trends prevailing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range of employer's contribution stated by the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  lies  between  10%  and  16%.   This,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, should be a comfortable band for most businesses\r\n\r\nto work within.  However, if the employees need to top it\r\n\r\nup,  and  it  is possible for them to do so, they  should\r\n\r\nresort  to using other financial tools such as instrument\r\n\r\nproducts to supplement retirement savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should also be encouraged to set up a\r\n\r\nsecond source of retirement fund to reward employees, and\r\n\r\nbuild  up a second pillar of savings in addition to their\r\n\r\nCPF savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another mindset change for employers would be for\r\n\r\nthem  to  recognise that total pay package  includes  the\r\n\r\nquantum  of employer's contribution to CPF.  This portion\r\n\r\nshould not be regarded as a benefit on top of the salary,\r\n\r\nbut  an  amount earned through the course of  employment.\r\n\r\nSo,  if  a  person earns $30,000 a year,  his  total  pay\r\n\r\npackage  will be $33,900, inclusive of the 13% employer's\r\n\r\ncontribution.   The  additional  $3,900  should  not   be\r\n\r\nregarded as an employee benefit but as part of his  gross\r\n\r\nsalary for the year.  Any additional amounts of CPF  paid\r\n\r\nthrough  performance  bonuses are  benefits  accrued.   A\r\n\r\ndistinction  between  the  two will  help  employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees better plan the use of CPF as an incentive tool\r\n\r\nto increase productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback I received from the ground is that a\r\n\r\nreduction  in  employer's CPF contribution is  tolerable,\r\n\r\nbut a pay cut is not.  But if it is necessary to do so, I\r\n\r\nwould not advocate that salary levels be cut down to that\r\n\r\ncomparable  to, say, China, for us to remain competitive.\r\n\r\nWe  must,  however, structure our salary scales inclusive\r\n\r\nof  employer's contribution to a level comparable to  our\r\n\r\nproductivity.  In this way, we get to enjoy a  reasonable\r\n\r\nstandard of living and still be competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Business Times reported on Monday, 25th August\r\n\r\n2003,  that  despite far higher labour cost  here,  total\r\n\r\nbusiness  overheads  in Singapore may  be  only  slightly\r\n\r\nhigher  than almost comparable wage levels in China,  the\r\n\r\nmuch  vaunted cheap workbench of the world, according  to\r\n\r\nconsulting  firm Political and Economic Risk  Consultancy\r\n\r\n(PERC).   Assuming  that  this  report  is  correct   and\r\n\r\nSingapore  reduces its cost of labour and thus  overheads\r\n\r\nfurther,  we should then be able to compete for a  bigger\r\n\r\nshare of the economic pie internationally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\ncall for retuning of the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Madam, many\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  that I have spoken to fully  appreciate  and\r\n\r\nsupport the decision of the Government to retune the CPF,\r\n\r\ncut  contribution  rate to 33% from 1st  October  and  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  range of CPF contributions to 30-36%.   I  am\r\n\r\nsure  Singaporeans and businesses alike also welcome  the\r\n\r\npackage  of  measures announced by DPM Lee earlier,  with\r\n\r\nabout  $900  million  going  to  support  businesses  and\r\n\r\nanother $132 million that will go to support Singaporeans\r\n\r\nin need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies in Singapore have, in the past years,\r\n\r\nsurvived  in extremely difficult economic conditions  and\r\n\r\ntougher  and tougher competitions.  Even when we  thought\r\n\r\nthat  we  were  turning the corner, we were  hit  by  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  the Iraqi war and SARS.  I can say that  most\r\n\r\ncompanies  have  tried  all they could  to  reduce  cost,\r\n\r\nincrease  productivity, retain and redeploy workers,  and\r\n\r\nas a last resort, some had to retrench workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the Government's decision to retune\r\n\r\nCPF  is  also a recognition that companies have done  all\r\n\r\nthey  could to reduce cost and a more fundamental  change\r\n\r\nto wage structure has to take place to ensure that we can\r\n\r\ncompete globally.  The cut from 36% to 33% will save $1.3\r\n\r\nbillion a year on employers' wage bill.  While the extent\r\n\r\nof  savings will differ from company to company, it could\r\n\r\nmean the difference between profit and loss, survival  or\r\n\r\nfailure  and, ultimately, translating into job  retention\r\n\r\nand  creation  or  job  loss.  It would  also  mean  that\r\n\r\nSingapore will be more attractive to foreign investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs have urged companies, which will enjoy a\r\n\r\nwindfall, to share the CPF cut with the workers.  I fully\r\n\r\nsupport  this notion.  Companies that do not  look  after\r\n\r\ntheir  workers cannot enjoy their loyalty and are  doomed\r\n\r\nto  failure.  However, I would like to put in a  word  of\r\n\r\ncaution,  lest  we  raise unrealistic  expectation.   The\r\n\r\nretuning  of  CPF is necessary to help reduce  costs  and\r\n\r\nmake our companies more competitive.  Companies will  use\r\n\r\nthis to lower their costs and make\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  products  and services cheaper or better  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  compete better and remain viable and,  in  the\r\n\r\nlong  run,  help to retain jobs or even to  create  jobs.\r\n\r\nThey  will  have,  in their own way,  to  make  the  most\r\n\r\nefficient  use  of  this saving, while  competition  with\r\n\r\nChina, India and the rest of the world will continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not certain that many will enjoy a real\r\n\r\nwindfall from this CPF cut.  Let me illustrate.   In  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times' article dated 21st August, it was reported\r\n\r\nthat big firms stand to save millions if CPF is cut.   It\r\n\r\nsaid  that  if there was a cut of employer's contribution\r\n\r\nfrom  16%  to  10%, then, for example,  SIA's  after  tax\r\n\r\nsaving  could be as high as $46 million.  Since there  is\r\n\r\nonly  a  3% cut, the assumed saving would be half or  $23\r\n\r\nmillion.  Will Singapore Airlines make enough money  this\r\n\r\nyear  so  that it can share the saving from the  CPF  cut\r\n\r\nwith their workers?  I am not certain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at it in perspective, Singapore Airlines\r\n\r\nhad announced on 30th July that it had suffered a loss of\r\n\r\n$312 million as compared with a profit of $478 million in\r\n\r\nthe first quarter of last year.  The savings from CPF cut\r\n\r\nwill  definitely  help  SIA  to  reduce  cost,  while  it\r\n\r\ncontinues its efforts to increase traffic and revenue and\r\n\r\nto  contain costs.  Even then, it will be an uphill  task\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  Airlines to match last  year's  financial\r\n\r\nprofit  of  about $1 billion.  As we can  see  from  this\r\n\r\nexample, companies like SIA may not be able to share  its\r\n\r\nsavings from CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those companies that are profitable, and the CPF\r\n\r\ncut  represents a real windfall, I fully agree that  they\r\n\r\nshould  share  the  savings with  their  workers  through\r\n\r\nbonuses,  performance  linked  incentives  and   so   on.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can even encourage these companies to continue\r\n\r\nto  pay the 16% CPF with the Government giving incentives\r\n\r\nto  them such as double tax relief on this extra 3%.  The\r\n\r\ncut  of  3% will help companies to some extent,  but  not\r\n\r\nsufficiently to really bring down business costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with several of the Members who spoke before\r\n\r\nme  that  we need to look at other ways to lower business\r\n\r\ncosts,  such  as fees, rates, rents, land  and  transport\r\n\r\ncosts.  I believe these have been sufficiently dealt with\r\n\r\nby DPM Lee and Minister of State Mr Raymond Lim earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is really on the return on CPF\r\n\r\nbalance.    Currently,  interest  paid  on  the  Ordinary\r\n\r\nAccount  is 2.5%, and 4% on other accounts.   Can  we  do\r\n\r\nbetter than the 2.5%?  I am quite confident that this  is\r\n\r\npossible.   I  would, therefore, urge the  Government  to\r\n\r\nlook  at better ways of managing the CPF fund and to give\r\n\r\na  better return to CPF members.  And, if we are able  to\r\n\r\ndo so, then it will certainly help to mitigate the cut in\r\n\r\nCPF rates of our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual members have tried through various\r\n\r\nschemes to improve the return on their CPF balances,  but\r\n\r\nnot  all achieved the same desirable results.  At the end\r\n\r\nof  31st December 2002, three million CPF members have  a\r\n\r\ntotal of $89.1 billion in their CPF balances.  I believe,\r\n\r\nwith this huge sum of money, the CPF Board has the skill,\r\n\r\nand  is  in a better position, to achieve better  returns\r\n\r\nthan  individual members themselves.  So I  believe  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  possibly  one way to increase  or  enhance  the\r\n\r\nreturns on members' CPF balances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nthank  you for allowing me to participate in this debate.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  Budget  debate this year,  I  spoke  of  the\r\n\r\nseveral  \"R\"  words that had dominated our  vocabulary  - Restructuring,  Remaking,  Refreshing,  Revitalising  and\r\n\r\nRenewal  -  all in the effort at preventing Retrenchment.\r\n\r\nYesterday,  PM  Goh  introduced  two  more  \"R\"  words  - Retuning   and   Restrategising  -  two  more   important\r\n\r\nprocesses  we  have  to undergo as  our  economy  remains\r\n\r\nrelevant  and effectively responsive to the ever-changing\r\n\r\nglobal  scene.   Perhaps another  \"R\"  word  we  have  to\r\n\r\nemphasise to Singaporeans is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Reality\".  There are several realities that I would like\r\n\r\nto focus on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality 1: We are at the mercy of our environment.\r\n\r\nCPF  has  been touted as one of Singapore's  most  sacred\r\n\r\ncows.   So  when a sacred cow is not spared, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust wake up and appreciate the gravity of the situation.\r\n\r\nNo  one can predict what else is going to happen in other\r\n\r\nparts of the world.  No one will know when the next  bomb\r\n\r\nwill explode or when SARS will reappear.  But the reality\r\n\r\nis,  unless we prepare ourselves for whatever may happen,\r\n\r\nwe  will  be  caught off-guard and we will  have  to  pay\r\n\r\ndearly for the consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality 2: We are no longer leading far ahead in\r\n\r\nthe  economic race.  One of the motivations  of  the  CPF\r\n\r\nchange is the realisation that Singaporeans are just  too\r\n\r\nexpensive to employ.  We used to be way ahead in the race\r\n\r\nand  thus  we command good wages because we are  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide  goods  and services that are  of  more  superior\r\n\r\nquality   compared   to  our  competitors.    But   these\r\n\r\ncompetitors are catching up and the reality is that  what\r\n\r\nwe can do today, they can do just as well, if not better.\r\n\r\nIf  we  do  not  find the competitive edge,  we  will  be\r\n\r\novertaken and left behind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality 3: Gone are the old jobs and get prepared\r\n\r\nfor  the  new jobs.  We have been talking much about  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  Singaporeans to understand that the  old  jobs\r\n\r\nthat  they are comfortable doing are gone and will  never\r\n\r\nbe  back.  Changes in the CPF rates promise to save  jobs\r\n\r\nand  bring  in more jobs.  But no amount of  CPF  cut  is\r\n\r\ngoing to help if Singaporeans do not realise the need for\r\n\r\nthem  to  do their part and be skilled for the jobs  that\r\n\r\nwill  come.  The jobs will come and they will go  if  the\r\n\r\nworkers are not prepared and ready for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality 4: Is money really not enough? - The need\r\n\r\nto  lower expectations and aspirations.  The decision  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to establish a range of  30-36%  as  the\r\n\r\ntarget for the CPF contribution sends a strong message to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  to  be flexible and nimble all the time.   Although\r\n\r\nthe  changes will not happen every year, it may and  will\r\n\r\nhappen under circumstances of great economic uncertainty.\r\n\r\nWe  have  heard  the  laments of many  Singaporeans,  and\r\n\r\nvoiced  by many Members of the House, about the  increase\r\n\r\nin the cost of living.  In not so many words, increase in\r\n\r\ncost of living translates to \"money not enough\".  But  is\r\n\r\nit really not enough?  Madam, the data from the Household\r\n\r\nExpenditure  Survey of 1997/98 showed  that  the  average\r\n\r\nhousehold expenditure exceeds household income for  those\r\n\r\nin  the less than $2,000 income group.  For example,  the\r\n\r\naverage  household  expenditure for those  earning  below\r\n\r\n$1,000   was   about   $1,300.   The  average   household\r\n\r\nexpenditure for those earning between $1,000  and  $1,500\r\n\r\nwas about $1,600.  But a closer look at the data leads to\r\n\r\nan  interesting interpretation.  For those earning  below\r\n\r\n$1,000,  about  half  spent less  than  $1,000  in  their\r\n\r\nhousehold  expenditure, ie, spending within their  means,\r\n\r\nperhaps.   For those earning between $1,000  and  $1,500,\r\n\r\nabout 57% spent equal or below their income levels.  From\r\n\r\na  strength  perspective, this  suggests  that  some  low\r\n\r\nincome  Singaporeans are capable of living  within  their\r\n\r\nmeans, while some are not.  The issue is complex and will\r\n\r\nbe  compounded by variables like the household  size  and\r\n\r\nthe  number of dependants in the household.  The question\r\n\r\nthen is: are we really living within our means and can we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  live  within our means in  times  when  our\r\n\r\nincomes  are  reduced?   Can  we  make  the  choices   of\r\n\r\nprioritising our expenditures such that we  are  able  to\r\n\r\nmake  do  without some, ie, are we able to  differentiate\r\n\r\nbetween our needs and our wants?  Or are the needs really\r\n\r\nbeyond our means?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, a related question is: are we being fair to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  having  given them so  much  promises  and\r\n\r\nhaving them increased their aspirations, we now tell them\r\n\r\nthey have to be realistic and lower their aspiration.  We\r\n\r\nencourage homeownership and we take pride in that 90%  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are home-owners, even when we know some  are\r\n\r\nstruggling to keep up with their payments.  We  encourage\r\n\r\nthem to upgrade, but when\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe lightning strikes, we must be there to help those who\r\n\r\nare  hurt.   It is more than just extending the  mortgage\r\n\r\nrepayment periods, more than just the ERS to cushion  the\r\n\r\nGST  increases.   It  is how we walk side  by  side  with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  as they overcome their difficulties.   Some\r\n\r\nof these difficulties are compounded by our own policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, last night some of the banks came out proudly\r\n\r\nannouncing their willingness to help Singaporeans who are\r\n\r\naffected  by  the proposed changes.  But these  are  only\r\n\r\ncases that already have existing loans with them.  I  see\r\n\r\nmany  residents  are severely affected  by  the  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn,  feel depressed and dejected when their  effort\r\n\r\nat  securing a bank loan is rejected.  They need to  sell\r\n\r\ntheir  flats  and downgrade for they cannot afford  their\r\n\r\nflats  anymore.   They  have huge  debts  to  settle  and\r\n\r\nbecause  of their poor credit standing, no bank wants  to\r\n\r\nlend  them  money.   Yes,  you  can  say  that  they  are\r\n\r\nresponsible for their own actions but, Madam, I think  we\r\n\r\nare  also  responsible for encouraging them to dream  and\r\n\r\naspire.   Now that they have woken up from the dream  and\r\n\r\nare facing reality, we must be there to support them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am glad to hear the support mechanism\r\n\r\nannounced by DPM Lee a while ago to help families who are\r\n\r\naffected.  I only have one appeal to make on the  revised\r\n\r\nHDB  rental  policy.   I laud the move  to  increase  the\r\n\r\nsalary  eligibility  criterion to $1,500  and  to  charge\r\n\r\nhigher  rentals  for  those  who  earn  more  than  $800.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I  urge  HDB to assess the  households  on  per\r\n\r\ncapita  income when deciding on the rent to charge  these\r\n\r\nfamilies.   I would also urge HDB to periodically  review\r\n\r\nthe  tenancy period such that those who can really afford\r\n\r\nit should be asked to purchase their flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality 5: Unemployment is a real possibility.\r\n\r\nWhile   the  proposed  changes  are  aimed  at   ensuring\r\n\r\nSingaporeans keep their jobs and more jobs would be  made\r\n\r\navailable, they do not negate the possibility  that  jobs\r\n\r\ncontinue to be threatened.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  threat is as real as SARS coming back every  winter.\r\n\r\nThe  shorter economic cycle necessitates that we  prepare\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  for  impending  unemployment.   Madam,  the\r\n\r\ncrisis has shown many Singaporeans that they cannot  take\r\n\r\ntheir  job,  nor  their  lifestyle  for  granted.    Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are caught unprepared.  I think the  changes\r\n\r\nin  the CPF fall short of preparing Singaporeans for  the\r\n\r\neventuality  of the next economic crisis when  they  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  job again.  When the crisis struck, many were  not\r\n\r\nprepared, as they did not have sufficient savings to pull\r\n\r\nthem  through.   They scrambled around  looking  for  the\r\n\r\nsafety  nets.  The Government also scrambled in  knitting\r\n\r\nthe net and throwing it at them.  We cannot allow this to\r\n\r\nhappen again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, anecdotal evidence suggests that apart from\r\n\r\nthe  compulsory  savings  of CPF,  Singaporeans  are  not\r\n\r\nsaving  enough.  In fact, many are indebted.   With  many\r\n\r\nspending  more than their incomes, one wonders  how  they\r\n\r\ncan  possibly  save.   We  have read  about  bankruptcies\r\n\r\nheading  for  an 18-year high.  A paper entitled  \"Wealth\r\n\r\nand  Liabilities of Singapore Households\",  published  by\r\n\r\nthe  DOS  in  March this year, noted that  the  ratio  of\r\n\r\noutstanding loans to the personal disposable  income  and\r\n\r\nGDP of Singapore is the highest amongst several developed\r\n\r\ncountries, like the US, Japan, UK and France.   Madam,  I\r\n\r\nthink one mindset that we have to change is that we  save\r\n\r\nonly for retirement and thus, with CPF, it would be fine.\r\n\r\nIn  reality,  CPF  will not guarantee a good  retirement,\r\n\r\nthus  the  need for us to radically change  some  of  its\r\n\r\nfeatures.    Recognising   this   too,   the   Government\r\n\r\nintroduced the Supplementary Retirement Scheme  (SRS)  to\r\n\r\nenhance  Singaporeans' savings mechanism for  retirement.\r\n\r\nBut  while we may save for retirement, I believe we  need\r\n\r\nto also save for potential unemployment.  While we may be\r\n\r\nat  the crossroads and taking the path of the CPF changes\r\n\r\nthat  may lead us back to the sunny island, the road  may\r\n\r\nbe  bumpy, with thunderstorms and lightning.  We need  to\r\n\r\nencourage  Singaporeans to be prepared  for  these  rainy\r\n\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2819</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rainy Day Account. Madam, I propose that the\r\n\r\nGovernment    introduce   a   scheme   that    encourages\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  save  for  unemployment.   I   am   not\r\n\r\nadvocating unemployment insurance for there are too  many\r\n\r\nnegative  social implications to it.  I am  proposing  an\r\n\r\nopt-in    savings   programme   that   can    incentivise\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to participate.  Such a scheme subscribes to\r\n\r\nthe  philosophy of self-reliance that we advocate in  the\r\n\r\npeople.   The key feature of this programme is  that  the\r\n\r\namount  of  benefits available upon unemployment  depends\r\n\r\nlargely  on one's own employment history, last-drawn  pay\r\n\r\nand  how  much he has saved in the account.  The benefits\r\n\r\navailable from the scheme are based, first, on  what  has\r\n\r\nbeen   accumulated  in  the  account  and,  second,  upon\r\n\r\nregistering  with  the  Singapore  Workforce  Development\r\n\r\nAgency  and  deemed  to  be  actively  seeking  work  and\r\n\r\nengaging in training, a line of credit may be extended to\r\n\r\nhim  after  he has exhausted the balance in his  account.\r\n\r\nHe  will continue to contribute to the account and  repay\r\n\r\nthe loan once he is gainfully employed again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we must make Singaporeans understand that\r\n\r\nsuch  savings must be one of the items that they work  on\r\n\r\nin  their  monthly budgets.  I am working  on  the  final\r\n\r\ndetails of the proposal and will be pleased to submit  it\r\n\r\nto the Government for consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, this is the second debate on the CPF in as\r\n\r\nmany   years.    Last  year  we  debated  it,   following\r\n\r\nrecommendations by the ERC.  We have been doing  so  much\r\n\r\nin   the   past  years  to  grapple  with  this  economic\r\n\r\nsituation.   Each  time we see a ray of  hope,  something\r\n\r\nhappens.  While we continue to give Singaporeans hope, we\r\n\r\nmust  moderate their expectations.  We must come to terms\r\n\r\nwith  the  realities.   Madam,  I  support  the  proposed\r\n\r\nchanges  and  hope  that by the end of this  debate  and,\r\n\r\nfurther into the future, in times of economic crisis like\r\n\r\nthis,  CPF will be remembered by Singaporeans as creating\r\n\r\na promising future and not cutting pay first.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Madam, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank the DPM for the comprehensive  and  well-designed assistance schemes that he has announced,  which\r\n\r\nwould  help  workers affected by the  CPF  changes.   But\r\n\r\ndespite  the generous relief package announced,  the  CPF\r\n\r\nmeasures announced will still mean pain for workers and I\r\n\r\nwould  like to highlight the far-reaching effects of  two\r\n\r\nchanges  in particular, and ask that the Government  pays\r\n\r\nspecial attention to these aspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the change to make the CPF rates more\r\n\r\nflexible.  With the change, the CPF rate will go  up  and\r\n\r\ndown  within the 30-36% range, depending on the  economic\r\n\r\nsituation.   Madam, this change will come on top  of  on-going  efforts to make wages more flexible and  the  wage\r\n\r\ncuts that workers are already taking.  The result is that\r\n\r\na  larger  portion of their wages, plus CPF, will  become\r\n\r\nvariable  and less reliable as a steady source of  funds.\r\n\r\nA  smaller amount of their wages will now be fixed.   The\r\n\r\nvariable portion can fluctuate, depending on the economic\r\n\r\nsituation.   And  we  know  that, increasingly,  economic\r\n\r\ncycles are getting shorter and more volatile.  This means\r\n\r\nthat  workers would have to factor in a greater level  of\r\n\r\nuncertainty in their plans for the future.   It  will  be\r\n\r\nharder  for  them to plan with confidence  and  to  chase\r\n\r\ntheir  Singapore Dream.  For instance, they should  think\r\n\r\nlong  and hard, in fact, longer and harder before  buying\r\n\r\nthe  biggest  flat  they can afford  at  that  particular\r\n\r\nmoment.   They must now factor in a big enough buffer  in\r\n\r\ncase   their  CPF  and  their  variable  wages  are   cut\r\n\r\ndrastically,  unexpectedly  as  well.   This  requires  a\r\n\r\ndrastic mindset change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also requires a special will to resist housing\r\n\r\nagents who do their sums for buyers on the basis of their\r\n\r\nprevailing  salaries and prevailing  CPF  rates  and  who\r\n\r\ninsist to buyers that they can afford it, never mind what\r\n\r\nthe future holds.  I have met too many workers living  in\r\n\r\nbigger  flats  who  now  regret bitterly  going  for  the\r\n\r\nbiggest  flats they could afford a few years back.   And,\r\n\r\nnow,  they  are having a hard time trying to  sell  their\r\n\r\nflats even if they want to downgrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, recently, I had a dialogue with the union\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the public daily-rated workers.   They  are\r\n\r\nbasically  the  bottom earners in Singapore.   I  am  the\r\n\r\nunion adviser.  One of them, an electrician, lives in a 5-room flat and has nothing in his CPF balance, ie, 0.   He\r\n\r\nis  52 years old and earns about $1,000 a month in gross.\r\n\r\nHe  takes  home about $800-plus a month and  he  supports\r\n\r\nthree  school-going children.  He has nothing in his  CPF\r\n\r\nbecause all has been used up to buy his 5-room flat.  His\r\n\r\nwife  and  his son also contribute their CPF towards  the\r\n\r\nflat.    But  when  we think about it, we  cannot  really\r\n\r\nblame  them  for  upgrading to a 5-room  flat  years  ago\r\n\r\nbecause, going by the CPF rate and the salaries  at  that\r\n\r\ntime,  they  could afford the flat.  They  had  dutifully\r\n\r\ndone their sums.  HDB did not discourage them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the flexible CPF rates coming on top of their\r\n\r\nother  uncertainties and worries can  be  psychologically\r\n\r\nquite  hard on Singaporeans.  A moving CPF target may  be\r\n\r\nan  easy  escape route for the Government and  employers.\r\n\r\nBut  for individuals, especially the lower income  living\r\n\r\nfrom  hand  to  mouth, it can be a trap.  I would  rather\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  just leave  the  CPF  at  a  fixed\r\n\r\nsustainable rate, say, 33%, or, if necessary,  just  30%,\r\n\r\nthan  to  have  it fluctuate between 30% and  36%.   When\r\n\r\ntimes  are good, it should return the cut to the  workers\r\n\r\nvia  CPF top-ups and wage bonuses, rather than raise  the\r\n\r\nrate.   When times are bad, the companies affected should\r\n\r\njust  shave  3%  off the variable part of the  wages,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  rather  than cut the CPF across-the-board  by\r\n\r\nanother three points to 30%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for this to work, employers must take wage\r\n\r\nreforms  seriously.   However, as  we  have  heard,  many\r\n\r\nemployers  continue  to drag their feet  on  this.   And,\r\n\r\nindeed,  when  the labour movement called for  profitable\r\n\r\ncompanies  to return the savings from CPF cut to  workers\r\n\r\nvia  special cash bonuses, some companies said that their\r\n\r\nsalary  structure does not allow for this.   It  is  that\r\n\r\nrigid.  Such a state of affairs is quite unacceptable  to\r\n\r\nworkers who have been asked, time and time again, to take\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCPF  and  wage cuts quickly and flexibly for the  greater\r\n\r\ngood.   Employers should take the extra  effort  to  also\r\n\r\nreform  their wage system and to reward workers  just  as\r\n\r\nquickly and as flexibly so as to be fair to the workers - if not for the greater good, then for their own good.  If\r\n\r\nworkers   see  their  employers  just  distributing   the\r\n\r\nwindfall  from  the CPF cut to shareholders  with  little\r\n\r\nimprovement  in the employment situation,  they  will  be\r\n\r\nless  inclined  to  support CPF cut  so  readily  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF should not be seen as part of the variable\r\n\r\nwages.   It should be seen as a fixed part of the  wages.\r\n\r\nIt  is important to keep a steady fixed stream of savings\r\n\r\nfor  retirement purposes.  I worry that as  long  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment allows CPF to be flexible, employers  will  be\r\n\r\nreluctant and slow to implement wage reforms to make  the\r\n\r\nwages  more flexible.  And I do not think this is in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the second difficult change for workers\r\n\r\ninvolves  the  raising  of the  Minimum  Sum.   By  2013,\r\n\r\nworkers  must  set aside $120,000 in their CPF,  half  in\r\n\r\nproperty, and $25,000 in their Medisave, before they  can\r\n\r\nwithdraw  their CPF balances at age 55.  I am  glad  that\r\n\r\nthis is being introduced in phases.  But, still, it would\r\n\r\nbe hard for workers, especially the lower skilled and the\r\n\r\nlower  income.  Take the example of a daily-rated cleaner\r\n\r\nthat  I  know,  who is 41 years old.  She  is  supporting\r\n\r\nthree  school-going children.  She will  be  affected  by\r\n\r\nthis  change.  She earns about $800 a month,  takes  home\r\n\r\nabout  $600-plus after deducting CPF.  She now has  about\r\n\r\n$20,000  in her CPF savings, and even if she works  night\r\n\r\nand  day,  for another 10 years, she will never build  up\r\n\r\nthe  required CPF Minimum Sum of $120,000.  So what  does\r\n\r\nretirement hold for her?  More back-breaking work?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, one important consequence of this Minimum\r\n\r\nSum requirement is that it will force workers, especially\r\n\r\nthe lower income, to just keep working, whatever the work\r\n\r\nis, till at least 62 years old, or else they will find it\r\n\r\nhard to survive.  They cannot withdraw from their CPF  at\r\n\r\nage 55 as they cannot meet the Minimum Sum\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrequirement  and  they  have  little,  if  any,  personal\r\n\r\nsavings to rely on.  Indeed, woe to the workers who  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs after 55 years old for reasons out  of  their\r\n\r\ncontrol,  such  as  the jobs disappearing  to  a  cheaper\r\n\r\nlocation  or their company restructuring.  They  will  be\r\n\r\ncaught  in the twilight zone, unable to get a job because\r\n\r\nof  the skills mismatch and the job market preference for\r\n\r\nyounger  workers, and unable to draw on their CPF savings\r\n\r\nbecause  of the higher Minimum Sum rule.  They will  have\r\n\r\nlittle, if any, savings to rely on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, if we do not pay attention to this group and\r\n\r\ndefuse  this potential time bomb, we will have a mass  of\r\n\r\nunhappy  jobless older Singaporeans with nowhere to  turn\r\n\r\nto  for  ready  funds,  except  maybe  the  loan  sharks.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  in this respect, my biggest worry is for  women.\r\n\r\nAccording to the latest CPF figures, as at 31st May 2003,\r\n\r\nwomen aged between 25 and 55 have a median net balance of\r\n\r\nonly  $27,000, compared to men in the same age range  who\r\n\r\nhave  about $36,500.  The median cash balance  refers  to\r\n\r\ncash remaining in the CPF accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another set of figures, that of the median regrossed\r\n\r\nbalance,  is even starker.  The median regrossed  balance\r\n\r\nincludes  cash CPF savings and those withdrawn under  the\r\n\r\nvarious  schemes  before  retirement.   For  women   aged\r\n\r\nbetween 25 and 55, their median regrossed balance is just\r\n\r\nabout $64,000, while men of the same age range have about\r\n\r\n$94,000.  In other words, on average, women have about  a\r\n\r\nthird  less  than men in their CPF accounts.  This  means\r\n\r\nthat,  compared to men, women would have  a  harder  time\r\n\r\nmeeting  their Minimum Sum requirement at  age  55.   The\r\n\r\nreasons for this include the fact that women tend to take\r\n\r\ntime  off  from work to care for their families and  then\r\n\r\nreturn to work later, often for lower pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, women tend to live longer and\r\n\r\nwould  arguably need more in their CPF savings for  their\r\n\r\nretirement.   I  urge  the  Government  to  pay   special\r\n\r\nattention to women to see how we can help them to prepare\r\n\r\nbetter for their retirement.  Perhaps, we should consider\r\n\r\na\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbigger  CPF  top-up for women, when times  are  good,  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  their  role as primary care givers  for  their\r\n\r\nfamilies,  like  the  way we recognise  NSmen  for  their\r\n\r\nsacrifice for the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also not forget singles who are the\r\n\r\nprimary care givers for their ageing parents or siblings.\r\n\r\nI  would suggest that the Minimum Sum need not be a fixed\r\n\r\namount, standard across all income groups, but should  be\r\n\r\ndifferentiated  with  different  figures  for   different\r\n\r\nincome  groups.  In this way, at least the  lower  income\r\n\r\ncan touch their CPF savings after 55 years old.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in every dialogue with workers and unionists,\r\n\r\nthey  have asked for the cost of living to be kept  down,\r\n\r\nas we have heard in this House.  I urge the Government to\r\n\r\ntake  these  calls  seriously and I am heartened  by  DPM\r\n\r\nLee's assurance that the Government is looking into  ways\r\n\r\nto  cut  waste.  But to cut waste, it does  not  mean  to\r\n\r\ntranslate  the savings into cheaper transport or  cheaper\r\n\r\nhousing  for workers.  So I would urge the Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider  whether  it is necessary  to  revive  the  Cost\r\n\r\nReview  Committee, under PMO, to examine every  facet  of\r\n\r\ntransport  costs, education costs and housing costs,  and\r\n\r\nput pressure on the Ministries and see how costs in these\r\n\r\nsectors  can  be  kept down.  And, in  fact,  the  Health\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  setting a model in how it  is  aggressively\r\n\r\nlooking  at  ways  to  cut  down  costs  which  will   be\r\n\r\ntranslated into keeping costs down for the consumers.  It\r\n\r\nwould  go a long way in assuring workers that their worry\r\n\r\nis  taken  seriously, especially since the GST will  rise\r\n\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in conclusion, workers accept these CPF\r\n\r\nchanges  because they want job security.  They also  want\r\n\r\nto retire with peace of mind.  They have been taking wage\r\n\r\ncuts   on   their  chin  and,  now,  the  CPF  cut.    In\r\n\r\nimplementing  these  changes, the  other  two  tripartite\r\n\r\npartners, the Government and the employers, must do their\r\n\r\npart to improve the situation for workers and to keep non-wage  costs down.  The tripartite partnership is only  as\r\n\r\nstrong as each partner is and each must be seen to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npull its weight fully during this difficult time.  It  is\r\n\r\nlike a three-legged race.  Each partner must keep pace or\r\n\r\nthe  race  to  save jobs and improve our  competitiveness\r\n\r\nwill fail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  as many of my colleagues have spoken before  me\r\n\r\nand  many  issues have been raised and covered,  I  would\r\n\r\nonly  touch  on  some of the issues that I feel  strongly\r\n\r\nabout and try to keep my speech as short as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, Singaporeans understand the need to tweak\r\n\r\nthe CPF to save jobs.  What it means for many is that, be\r\n\r\nit in their take-home pay or their CPF account, they have\r\n\r\nto  make every penny work and work even harder.  But I am\r\n\r\nsure that the announcement made by DPM would go down well\r\n\r\nto allay some of the concerns of the workers.  In fact, I\r\n\r\nam  really  happy that the Government is showing  genuine\r\n\r\nconcern and is acting on the feedback from the ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, recently, there has been an increase of\r\n\r\nbankruptcy cases.  In fact, the Straits Times reported on\r\n\r\n27th August 2003 that bankruptcies are set to hit an  18-year high.  It will reach levels not seen even during the\r\n\r\nlast  major recessions of 1985 and 1986.  With  the  weak\r\n\r\neconomy, there are many companies that hit the bottom  of\r\n\r\nthe sea, taking with them many individuals who are either\r\n\r\ndirectors,  owners, or sole proprietors with them.   That\r\n\r\nis  part of the business risk, and these businessmen knew\r\n\r\nwhat they were in for.  But the unfortunate group are the\r\n\r\nemployees  who  find that they have not only  lost  their\r\n\r\njobs  but  also their CPF contributions held in trust  by\r\n\r\nthe  companies.  As I understand, many of these companies\r\n\r\nwould deduct their employees' monies as CPF contributions\r\n\r\nbut  delay for months from crediting the amounts to their\r\n\r\nCPF  accounts.  As a result, when the companies  hit  the\r\n\r\niceberg and sank, the employees were left in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncold  icy water.  All that the CPF Board could do was  to\r\n\r\nrepresent  them at the creditors' meeting.  Even  if  the\r\n\r\nCPF Board was a first lien on any money that was left  of\r\n\r\nthe   insolvent  company,  there  would  be  nothing   to\r\n\r\ncompensate these workers for the loss of their  very  own\r\n\r\nmonies.  So the CPF first lien becomes a paper type.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the Law Society is looking into requiring\r\n\r\nlawyers  to deposit their clients' monies into a  special\r\n\r\naccount  held  by  an  independent  body,  the  time   is\r\n\r\nopportune  for  the  CPF  rules  to  be  changed.    With\r\n\r\nelectronic  banking and technology, the CPF  can  arrange\r\n\r\nfor employees' contributions to be deducted directly from\r\n\r\ntheir  salaries into the Board's accounts.  In this  way,\r\n\r\neven if a company sinks, the employee will only lose  his\r\n\r\nemployer's  contribution, but not his  own  contribution.\r\n\r\nIn fact, employers who use their employee's contributions\r\n\r\nto  roll back into business and defer payment to the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard  are  arguably  committing a  serious  offence.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  it  is  now timely to do something  about  this.\r\n\r\nSince  the  Government is fine-tuning the CPF  rules,  it\r\n\r\nshould  also  look  into this loophole  and  protect  the\r\n\r\nworkers for whatever that is left in their savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who escape the property downturn, I hope\r\n\r\nthat   they   learn  from  the  experience   of   others.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must  take  heed  of  their  own  financial\r\n\r\nplanning.  They have to understand that the days of going\r\n\r\nfor bigger and bigger flats are no longer viable, just as\r\n\r\nprices can go up, they can fall too, and even faster.   I\r\n\r\nremember that, in 1995 and 1996, Bishan flats were one of\r\n\r\nthe  highest priced HDB properties.  Today, some of these\r\n\r\nproperty  owners  are facing serious difficulties.   Even\r\n\r\nif  they  want to cut losses and bail out, they may  find\r\n\r\ndifficulty in finding a buyer, at least in the near term.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the demand pattern is likely to change with more\r\n\r\npeople turning to rent, rather than buy the flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the younger generation and potential property\r\n\r\nowners,  may  I suggest that they plan wisely  and  think\r\n\r\ncarefully.  With the greater policy changes that may come\r\n\r\nsoon, as mentioned by DPM earlier, our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyounger generation will have more choices and they should\r\n\r\nplan better.  I would say it is better that they endure a\r\n\r\nlittle  hardship  or  inconvenience now  while  in  their\r\n\r\nyouths, than jeopardising their future at old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same light, I am glad that the Ministry of\r\n\r\nNational Development will make the necessary changes, and\r\n\r\nit will be a welcome one in these present times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we must understand that the ripple effect of\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  cut  goes  beyond just  servicing  mortgage  or\r\n\r\nproperty  loans.  Consumer spending pattern will  change,\r\n\r\nas  people prioritise on their expenditure.  But for  the\r\n\r\neconomy  to  get  out of its current woes,  the  dose  of\r\n\r\nmedicine will require a multi-disciplinary approach.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  also  look at  a  whole  spectrum  of\r\n\r\nindirect  taxation that is contributing to high  business\r\n\r\ncosts.   The  efforts announced by DPM in his  speech  is\r\n\r\ngood   news,   but  I  hope  they  will  translate   into\r\n\r\nsignificant   cost  cutting,  and   the   cost   of   all\r\n\r\ngovernmental fees will need to be realigned  to  the  new\r\n\r\neconomic situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Government Ministries should be more\r\n\r\nfrugal  in  spending.  Cost-cutting  measures  should  be\r\n\r\nintroduced wherever possible.  By this, I mean that civil\r\n\r\nservants  should  be measured against  their  ability  to\r\n\r\nprovide  an efficient and cost-effective public  service,\r\n\r\nnot by the credit balances in their coffers at the end of\r\n\r\neach year.  Singaporeans are practical people.  They know\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  other  charges that  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nincreased in the days to come for one reason or another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF retuning introduced by the Government will\r\n\r\nbenefit the big companies more than the smaller ones.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  do more to help our SMEs who are our own  home-grown  companies, our own entrepreneurs.  These  are  the\r\n\r\ncompanies that do not employ many workers, due  to  their\r\n\r\nsize  or  technology.  Many of them do not  benefit  much\r\n\r\nfrom  the CPF cuts.  Though the package announced earlier\r\n\r\nto  assist  SMEs  is  a  welcome one,  I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  work out a wider package of other measures to  help\r\n\r\nour SMEs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the current scenario brought me back\r\n\r\nto my student days when I was in France in the 1980s.   I\r\n\r\nread about European companies leaving the country to move\r\n\r\nto  Southeast Asia, where operating costs were lower.  It\r\n\r\ncaused   unemployment,  and  unions  battled   with   the\r\n\r\nemployers  and  government, as  protectionism  sentiments\r\n\r\nemerged.   Today,  some  of the  industries  returned  to\r\n\r\nEurope, especially those which are dependent on a highly-skilled  workforce.  But unemployment still prevails  and\r\n\r\nthe  numbers are still high.  What it means for Singapore\r\n\r\nis  that,  even as we take these corrective measures,  we\r\n\r\ncannot but face the fact that, in time, we have to change\r\n\r\nmindsets as we will have to face the ills that come as we\r\n\r\napproach  the  developed economy status.  Yes,  there  is\r\n\r\neconomic growth, but so too unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I would wrap up by hoping that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will look into the proposal to  give  further\r\n\r\nprotection  to  workers' CPF by amending  the  rules  and\r\n\r\ndrawing  up a more comprehensive package which will  help\r\n\r\nour SMEs.  I am sure many Singaporeans will be cheered by\r\n\r\nthe generous relief package announced by DPM earlier but,\r\n\r\nagain,  some may not.  Nevertheless, I am confident  that\r\n\r\nmany have found something to be happy about in it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the retuning of CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I\r\n\r\nam  an independent director of two listed companies doing\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  China.  One, a metal stamping and  computer\r\n\r\nparts  manufacturer, pays only about S$120 per month  per\r\n\r\nworker  in Guangzhou and Suzhou.  The other, a  fish  and\r\n\r\nvegetable processing company, pays about S$130 per  month\r\n\r\nper  worker  in Qingdao.  And when I first visited  these\r\n\r\nfactories,  I  was taken aback.  How can we then  compete\r\n\r\nagainst PRC workers unless we restructure our economy and\r\n\r\nsharpen our competitiveness?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it does not mean that we have to lower our\r\n\r\nwages to the level of the PRC workers.  But it does  mean\r\n\r\nthat  we  must  try  hard to improve our competitiveness,\r\n\r\nespecially in terms of value-add and quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, India is another rising giant, in terms of\r\n\r\noutsourcing and service industries.  Now, more  and  more\r\n\r\nglobal  companies are outsourcing their IT, call  centres\r\n\r\nand   backroom   operations  to  India,  including   some\r\n\r\nSingapore  companies and MNCs.  It is, therefore,  really\r\n\r\nno  fun  to  be squeezed between China and  India  -  two\r\n\r\ngiants.   Nearer  home, even Thailand  and  Malaysia  are\r\n\r\nrapidly  changing and competing against us  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing,  logistics and even  healthcare.   Bangkok\r\n\r\nand Malaysia are fast developing their medical facilities\r\n\r\nfor  foreign patients.  They compete fiercely against our\r\n\r\nprivate  hospitals in terms of costs.  And  we  are  well\r\n\r\naware  of the fierce competition from the Malaysian  port\r\n\r\nat Tanjung Pelapas.  And the story goes on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a competitive situation, Singapore cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to stand still, or we will be priced out  of  the\r\n\r\ncompetition and out of existence.  For small  and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises that are struggling and trying to keep  their\r\n\r\nheads  above  water,  the reduction in  CPF  contribution\r\n\r\ncould  be a lifeline thrown at them.  It would definitely\r\n\r\nhelp  cash  flow.  It would definitely make a difference:\r\n\r\nstaying  afloat or going under the water.  If  more  SMEs\r\n\r\nsurvive, jobs will be saved in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the CPF changes will therefore send a strong\r\n\r\nsignal  to  MNCs and foreign investors that Singapore  is\r\n\r\nmaking  a  concerted and determined  effort  to  cut  and\r\n\r\ncontain  costs.  MNCs will consider this  a  plus  factor\r\n\r\nand,  if  they stay put and expand in Singapore, we  will\r\n\r\navoid  the  hollowing-out effect.  And if new investments\r\n\r\ncome  in  as a result, more new jobs will be created  for\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans.  I have met some MNC  and  local  CEOs\r\n\r\nrecently, and they are upbeat about the changes  and  the\r\n\r\npositive impact on our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister confirmed that the CPF cut\r\n\r\nwould  be  by 3%, from 36% to 33%, there was  a  sigh  of\r\n\r\nrelief.  People feared the worst, a possible cut to  30%.\r\n\r\nWe  can  see from here that the Government has  exercised\r\n\r\ngreat restraint and care phasing in gradually the changes\r\n\r\nin  the  CPF salary ceiling, Minimum Sum and the Medisave\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum  for  CPF  withdrawal  at  the  age  of  55.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  the  Government  has  taken  great  pains   to\r\n\r\nimplement a package to cushion the impact of CPF  changes\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans,  as we heard in  this  Chamber  today.\r\n\r\nThey are really encouraging and better than expected, and\r\n\r\nwe can say for sure that the Government has left no stone\r\n\r\nunturned  to help each and every Singaporean in his  time\r\n\r\nof need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, I would like to appeal to banks and\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions  to do  their  utmost  to  assist\r\n\r\nhomeowners,  particularly those  from  the  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroups  who  are adversely affected by the  CPF  changes.\r\n\r\nBanks  should consider seriously reducing interest rates,\r\n\r\nrestructuring the loans and extending the loan  repayment\r\n\r\nperiods for their customers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers should not take the workers for granted.\r\n\r\nThey should take note of and recognise the sacrifices  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers in forgoing their CPF.  Companies  that  are\r\n\r\ndoing  well  should  therefore  share  their  savings  or\r\n\r\nprofits  with  their  workers through  increases  in  the\r\n\r\nvariable  wage components or through bonuses.   Employers\r\n\r\nshould  also lead by example, and cut management salaries\r\n\r\nand fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, CPF cut is not the only factor or solution.\r\n\r\nWhat  about  cuts  in  corporate  and  individual  taxes,\r\n\r\nGovernment  levies and fees?  And, not to  forget,  there\r\n\r\nshould  also  be  cuts  in  red tape  in  the  Government\r\n\r\nbureaucracy.   Cuts should not be one-sided.   Otherwise,\r\n\r\nCPF cuts will be in vain.  In that sense, I am encouraged\r\n\r\nthat  DPM  Lee  and the Minister of State for  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry, Mr Raymond Lim, have both pledged today in this\r\n\r\nChamber  that the Government will try its best to contain\r\n\r\nand cut red tape and fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Prime Minister said, we are at the\r\n\r\ncrossroads.  There comes a time in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  history  of  the  nation  when  we  have  to  decide\r\n\r\ncollectively  to move forward, or to fall behind  and  be\r\n\r\nmarginalised.   The choice is clear.  We have  to  retune\r\n\r\nCPF.  We have to retool our economy.  We have to bite the\r\n\r\nbullet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Chinese, it is said \"chang tong bu ru duan tong\",\r\n\r\nie,  rather than suffer long agonising pain of  prolonged\r\n\r\nunemployment,  it  is better to have  it  out,  bear  the\r\n\r\nimmediate   pain  of  CPF  adjustment,  restructure   the\r\n\r\neconomy,  sharpen  our  competitive  edge,  attract   new\r\n\r\ninvestments, and create new jobs for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have overcome many crises before: Separation,\r\n\r\nearly  British withdrawal, the 1984 recession  and,  most\r\n\r\nrecently,  the SARS crisis.  Fear not.  We have  done  it\r\n\r\nbefore, and we can do it again.  We shall overcome.   The\r\n\r\neconomy  will  recover  and rise  again.   Jobs  will  be\r\n\r\nplentiful  for  Singaporeans.  There  will  be  a  better\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, therefore, the time for all Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nrally  behind  the Government, to work as a united  team.\r\n\r\nWe shall triumph and prevail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the CPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mdm\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, the Prime Minister raised the proposal to\r\n\r\nretune  the CPF.  He said we have to throw away  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  burdens  so  that  we can climb  this  road  to  the\r\n\r\nhighland.   This reminded me of the \"Reform  and  Opening\r\n\r\nUp\" of China.  In the early 1980s, when China started  to\r\n\r\nhave  this reform and this opening to the outside  world,\r\n\r\nMr  Deng Xiaoping's famous quotes were displayed  at  big\r\n\r\nbillboards  along  the thoroughfare in Shenzhen  at  that\r\n\r\ntime.  He said that, \"If we do not open up and we do  not\r\n\r\nreform,  this would be a dead world for us.\"   The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister did not mention about death yesterday.   But  at\r\n\r\nthe  National  Day  Rally, he said  that  if  you  cannot\r\n\r\nbreathe,  then you will die.  If you just lose face,  you\r\n\r\nwould  not die.  And the Deputy Prime Minister  had  just\r\n\r\nproposed the relief\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npackages.  These are a shot in the arm.  So, even if  you\r\n\r\nmay  lose face a bit, you can still stand up and then you\r\n\r\ncan  walk.  In the past, when we fell down, we just stood\r\n\r\nup  and  walked  again.  But now, when we fall  down  and\r\n\r\nscratch ourselves, we wait for the Government to help us.\r\n\r\nSo,  I think the people should take action themselves and\r\n\r\ncannot  just  rely  on  the Government.   Thus,  while  I\r\n\r\nsupport  the  PM's  retuning  of  CPF  and  DPM's  relief\r\n\r\npackage,  the  issue here is: what next?   I  have  three\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as the Prime Minister has said, we have to\r\n\r\nlighten our burden, to travel light, and we have to  have\r\n\r\na  thorough  reform.  It is our hope that the  Government\r\n\r\nand  the whole set-up would cut waste, just like what the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister has said,  the  Cut  Waste  Panel\r\n\r\n(CWP).   I  think the Government should do it  thoroughly\r\n\r\nand have a thorough reform of the whole service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NTUC had held dialogues with 38 unions involving a\r\n\r\nfew  hundred union leaders.  They all understand that  we\r\n\r\nneeded to adjust our expectation.  We have accepted  this\r\n\r\nCPF  adjustment.  The question they asked is,  \"Will  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  adjust  our  cost  of  living?\"   \"Will   the\r\n\r\nGovernment reduce its charges?\"  \"Will the employers look\r\n\r\nafter our welfare?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM has given us an assurance. The Government\r\n\r\nshould  change the mechanism.  So, when the workers  have\r\n\r\nadjusted,  the Government should also adjust.  One  point\r\n\r\nbrought  up  by  many  people  is  that  they  could  not\r\n\r\nunderstand why is it that hospitals still insist that  if\r\n\r\nyou stay in a B1 or B2, you cannot downgrade to a C-class\r\n\r\nward.   And if you are living in a 4 or 5-room flat,  why\r\n\r\nnot make the downgrading easier for them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this song \"Struggle to Win\" saying that\r\n\r\nsometimes  you  go  up and sometimes you  go  down.   The\r\n\r\nTeochews said that if you can only go up and cannot  come\r\n\r\ndown,  the  whole  family will  die.   So,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should do away with all the bureaucratic  red\r\n\r\ntape.  We are having a problem now.  All said, we want to\r\n\r\nreform.  But when the economy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecovers,  let us hope that the civil servants  will  not\r\n\r\nsay that we will have to increase charges here and there.\r\n\r\nIf  that happens, everything will go back to what it  was\r\n\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the employers are concerned, I am very\r\n\r\nhappy  to note that although Dr Gan See Khem is  also  an\r\n\r\nemployer, she feels that employers should do more to care\r\n\r\nabout their employees.  Many employers give a lot of  lip\r\n\r\nservice.   They  talk a lot but do very  little.   So,  I\r\n\r\nthink  when  the employers have benefited from  this  CPF\r\n\r\ncut,  and  if they are doing well, they should share  the\r\n\r\ngain with their workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as jobs are concerned, nowadays, we keep\r\n\r\nhearing employers saying that Singaporeans do not want to\r\n\r\ndo certain kind of work.  But the question is:  what type\r\n\r\nof  job  -  because the work system and  salary  are  not\r\n\r\nconducive for locals.  They treated Singapore workers  as\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  I think the employers should redesign,\r\n\r\nre-engineer their work so that workers will find it  more\r\n\r\nfriendly  and  conducive to work.  In this  aspect,  NTUC\r\n\r\nwill  work closely with the employers in various  sectors\r\n\r\non  this  so  that more unemployed Singaporeans  can  get\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Government is very good in its\r\n\r\nfinancial   management.   But  this  CPF  adjustment   is\r\n\r\nactually a manifestation of Government's financial policy\r\n\r\nand  philosophy.  The ordinary folks may not be  good  in\r\n\r\nmanaging  their finances.  Singaporeans in  general  know\r\n\r\nthe ways to prosper and want to make profits, but they do\r\n\r\nnot know how to manage their fortune.  It is said that if\r\n\r\nyou  save  one  handful of rice in every meal,  in  three\r\n\r\nyears,  you  will be able to buy a horse.  When  we  talk\r\n\r\nabout  horses, Singaporeans will always talk about horses\r\n\r\nin  terms of buying 4-D during the weekends and make some\r\n\r\nwindfall from there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also said that even billionaires should be\r\n\r\ncalculative.   However, Singaporeans  take  this  to  the\r\n\r\nextent that as they have a few thousands dollars in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCPF,  they have to keep calculating about it every  night\r\n\r\nand  every day. They always look at how they can maximise\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister had mentioned about the\r\n\r\ninadequacy  of the Minimum Sum and proposed  that  it  be\r\n\r\nraised over a period of time.  We have to explain to  our\r\n\r\npeople  plainly. Otherwise, the Government may put  in  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  efforts. They may have very good intentions  but\r\n\r\nthe   people  would  not  appreciate  it.  In   financial\r\n\r\nmanagement,  we  do not just resort to the  experts.   We\r\n\r\nshould  teach every Singaporean how to manage  their  own\r\n\r\nwealth and property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Prime Minister had mentioned that this\r\n\r\nreform  is  painful.  In other words,  everyone  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  endure some pain.  The Prime Minister  said\r\n\r\nthat if we do not have a fish, even a prawn will do.  But\r\n\r\nI  have people telling me that prawns are as expensive as\r\n\r\nfish.   It  shows that people are not thinking  what  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  was thinking.  The Prime  Minister  said\r\n\r\nthat  if we do not eat fish, then eat the cheaper  prawns\r\n\r\nbut  Singaporeans are thinking about the  more  expensive\r\n\r\nprawns.  I  think, in this case, if you have no  fish  to\r\n\r\neat,  you have to adjust downwards to have dried  prawns,\r\n\r\nnot fresh prawns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier on, Mr Low Thia Khiang had said that the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister might have forgotten, might have  amnesia\r\n\r\nthat we promised a better life.  In fact, Government  has\r\n\r\nnot  forgotten what they have promised. They want to give\r\n\r\nthe people a better living.  Thus, the retuning of CPF is\r\n\r\nexactly with this aim in mind that you must first of  all\r\n\r\nhave  a  job before you can live a better life.   So  our\r\n\r\nGovernment is anxious about them.  That is why we have to\r\n\r\ndo  this reform very speedily, as fast as we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that Government has not\r\n\r\nfulfilled  its  commitment to the people  and  we  should\r\n\r\napologise  to the people.  I think he did not  understand\r\n\r\nthe  serious  situation.  For instance, if a  father  had\r\n\r\npromised  the child that if he passed his PSLE, he  would\r\n\r\ngive  him  a  watch.   But  now,  the  father  runs  into\r\n\r\nfinancial problem.  He may not be able to afford to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuy  the  son a good watch but he will still  buy  him  a\r\n\r\nwatch when he gets a job.  The son can understand.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  why Mr Low Thia Khiang cannot understand.   Mr\r\n\r\nLow  compared the Government with that of a rabbit  which\r\n\r\nhas  been sleeping and has just woken up from its  dream.\r\n\r\nI  must  say that the Government has sleepless nights  on\r\n\r\nthe  job situation in Singapore.  So if you do not sleep,\r\n\r\nhow  do you have a dream?  Every day, the Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen thinking of how to restructure our wages.  The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  already raised a lot  of  points  in  this\r\n\r\naspect, I would not repeat them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Ministry of Manpower to get\r\n\r\nmore  Singaporeans  upgraded through  its  newly  set  up\r\n\r\nWorkforce Development Agency.  The new economy has  taken\r\n\r\naway  many of our jobs, so we have to speed up our skills\r\n\r\nredevelopment  programmes.   NTUC  has  launched  various\r\n\r\nupgrading programmes and many workers have benefited from\r\n\r\nthis  scheme.   But some people do not see  the  benefits\r\n\r\nincluding  Mr  Low  Thia Khiang.  He has  said  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should apologise to the people. Actually,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  looking at the big picture.   Many  years\r\n\r\nago,  we  had  already  made the  preparation  by  urging\r\n\r\nworkers to adopt the lifelong learning approach.  Now  it\r\n\r\nis raining, and the weather is getting very stormy, so we\r\n\r\nhave to prepare ourselves for the stormy weather.  Mr Low\r\n\r\nThia  Khiang  blamed the Government for the bad  weather.\r\n\r\nMy point is that we could not stop the bad weather but we\r\n\r\ncan  prepare  for it.  I think we should  encourage  more\r\n\r\nworkers to participate in these training courses so  that\r\n\r\nwe  could see the general trend.  It is not the time  for\r\n\r\nus to blame one another. We should be working together in\r\n\r\none heart.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, as\r\n\r\nPM  revealed  the  CPF  retuning measures  yesterday,  he\r\n\r\nlikened  the  measures that we have  to  take  as  bitter\r\n\r\npills.   As I sat listening to DPM this afternoon, laying\r\n\r\nout  the  assistance and relief programmes, it  was  like\r\n\r\nlistening  to a Budget statement delivery in  a  form  of\r\n\r\nsweets for Singaporeans affected by the CPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister's National Day Rally speech\r\n\r\nprovided  a  sombre backdrop to our workers today  -  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty   in  finding  jobs  for  school-leavers   and\r\n\r\ngraduates,  the  fear of retrenchment, the  realities  of\r\n\r\nbeing   retrenched,  the  difficulty  of   securing   re-employment,  the  face  of international  terrorism,  the\r\n\r\ndeadly  SARS  outbreak.  With all these before  us,  some\r\n\r\nwere worried that the Singapore dream has broken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be beaten if we allow ourselves to fall into\r\n\r\nthis mindset. Singaporeans were asked to rally around the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  these difficult times.  Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\nMembers of this House asked what the Government could  do\r\n\r\nto  help us rise out of this valley of gloom.  Today,  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard  from  DPM  the programmes  that  would  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans taking the bitter pill, much more palatable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM's analogy of the boiled frog is that we have to\r\n\r\nact  now.   The  changes to the CPF will  help  us.   The\r\n\r\nsaving  of jobs is the key objective here. The signal  to\r\n\r\ninvestors and employers is clear.  We all agree on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans, who have been holding their\r\n\r\nbreath  since  the  National Day  Rally,  were  a  little\r\n\r\nrelieved  yesterday when the CPF retuning  measures  were\r\n\r\nrevealed.  Then, there were those who have been  worrying\r\n\r\nabout  the  top-ups to pay for their mortgages.   We  now\r\n\r\nknow   that  they  number  76,000,  although   big,   but\r\n\r\nmanageable and will be assisted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With impending changes to HDB's policy that are to\r\n\r\nbe  announced, it is clear that the Government is serious\r\n\r\nand  leaving no stones unturned to help our people.  This\r\n\r\nis  an  unwavering  fundamental  commitment  of  the  PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment.   Just  like  the SARS  battle,  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nrallied to the Government's call for action and to  forge\r\n\r\na strong bond that the international community held us in\r\n\r\nhigh regard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, though the sacred cow of the CPF\r\n\r\nhas been adjusted and tampered with, the Government's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbond and trust with the people, to this Singaporean,  has\r\n\r\nnot  been broken.  Singaporeans will once again be lauded\r\n\r\nfor  taking  hard  knocks and rolling  with  the  punches\r\n\r\nwhenever necessary to keep the Singapore ship ship-shape,\r\n\r\nsea-worthy and sailing on. Fundamentally, we will all get\r\n\r\ntogether and push on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I had prepared a long speech, asking the\r\n\r\nGovernment to do this and that.  After DPM's statement, I\r\n\r\nam  glad  that the programmes that will be put  in  place\r\n\r\nwill address the people's concerns and that help will  be\r\n\r\ndelivered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to touch on PM's message\r\n\r\nyesterday about changing our lifestyles and to be prudent\r\n\r\nin  our  spending.   The Government is  encouraging  more\r\n\r\nemployers  to adopt the monthly variable wage  component.\r\n\r\nIn  future, the employer's CPF contribution can also vary\r\n\r\nin  accordance  with how the economy performs.   Both  of\r\n\r\nthese  components, taking effect at the same time,  might\r\n\r\nbe  a  double-whammy for some people, if they do  not  do\r\n\r\ntheir financial planning well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the mortgage interest rates are at\r\n\r\nhistoric  lows.  As sure as the rates have come  down  in\r\n\r\nrecent years, these rates will once again rise. There may\r\n\r\nbe  periods where the interest rate increase may  overlap\r\n\r\nwith  the  reduction in the income due to a reduction  in\r\n\r\nemployer's  CPF  and a reduction in the monthly  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent.   People should take this time to refocus  and\r\n\r\nto look at prudent spending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be no formula in place to indicate when\r\n\r\nthe  employer's CPF would be increased or decreased.   It\r\n\r\nwill  mean that Singaporeans must be realistic  in  their\r\n\r\nbudgeting for housing costs.  I understand that it may be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  have a formula in place,  as  well  as  to\r\n\r\nstipulate a definite notice period.  Having this  formula\r\n\r\nor  a stipulated period of notice will hem in and inhibit\r\n\r\nthe  Government's responses in case when our  economy  is\r\n\r\nthreatened\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nonce  again.  So Singaporeans should create a  buffer  in\r\n\r\ntheir  finances  in  good years and it  can  be  done  by\r\n\r\nspending   prudently,  and  to  make  changes  to   their\r\n\r\nlifestyles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the CPF retuning.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development and Minister for Defence (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, so many\r\n\r\nspeakers  have  spoken.   So  much  has  been  said.  The\r\n\r\nanalysts  have  dissected all  the  figures.   The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  gave  an excellent overview. DPM  gave  a  very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  review of the relief measures  that  would\r\n\r\ncushion the impact of this proposed CPF cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I asked myself whether I should speak. One less\r\n\r\nspeaker  out of 51 speakers makes no difference.   But  I\r\n\r\nthought to myself:  maybe I should speak.  So I asked  my\r\n\r\ngood  friend here, Dr Tan Cheng Bock, \"Shall I  speak  or\r\n\r\nnot?  I would sound like a broken record.\"  He said, \"No,\r\n\r\nyou must speak.\"  And he will also be speaking on Monday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, on the way back home from this House, I\r\n\r\ntuned in to the Chinese radio programme, FM95.8.  I  urge\r\n\r\nall  Members  to listen to the feedback programme  around\r\n\r\n5.30-6.30  pm.   It gives honest feedback  from  Chinese-speaking HDB heartlanders.  I heard my friend, Kwek  Teng\r\n\r\nSwee, who said that this 3% CPF cut does not cut any  ice\r\n\r\nwith  SMEs.  In fact, I read in Zaobao today and  he  was\r\n\r\nquoted to have said that the CPF cut will save him a  few\r\n\r\nhundred  dollars  but, in turn,  he  has  to  pay  a  few\r\n\r\nthousand  dollars,  because of the 1% GST  increase  next\r\n\r\nyear.   Then  the  DJ  decided,  I  think,  to  get  more\r\n\r\nemployees  to  speak on the channel.  One  employee  said\r\n\r\nthat  he did not agree with these employers as they  were\r\n\r\nlooking at their perspective. 3% was a lot to him.  As he\r\n\r\nwas  a  wage earner, a few hundred dollars cut  sometimes\r\n\r\nmeans life and death, whether he could send his child  to\r\n\r\nschool or whether he could cut back on his tuition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate goes on in spite of comments by some\r\n\r\nnewspaper  analysts.  One in Today  saying  that  it  was\r\n\r\nalmost  a  non-event, when people expected a 6% CPF  cut,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister announced 3%.  The debate in the House\r\n\r\nyesterday simmered down to a low ebb.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the debate goes on outside this House. 3% is a\r\n\r\nlot  of  money  to many people.  When PSA retrenched  the\r\n\r\nworkers  earlier this year, I was one of the MPs who  was\r\n\r\ninvolved  directly.  Not only was I the  advisor  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Port  Workers'  Union  (SPWU),  many  of   the\r\n\r\nretrenched workers actually live in Tiong Bahru  and  the\r\n\r\nTanjong  Pagar GRC area.  In fact, one of my RC  Chairmen\r\n\r\nwas    retrenched.   Another   Vice-Chairman   was   also\r\n\r\nretrenched.  Many residents were also retrenched.  I feel\r\n\r\nvery  sad for them because many of them are in their 40s.\r\n\r\nAnd  in their 40s, as my friend, Mr Nithiah Nandan  said,\r\n\r\nit  is quite hard to find a job because jobs are hard  to\r\n\r\ncome by and the cost of doing business is high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I decided therefore that instead of going\r\n\r\nthrough  many of the comments that Members of  the  House\r\n\r\nhave spoken on, I would look for something inspiring.   I\r\n\r\ndo not know whether you have heard this story.  But a few\r\n\r\nmonths  ago,  a  true  life human story  of  courage  and\r\n\r\nendurance  made  the  headlines  around  the  world.   An\r\n\r\naccomplished  mountain climber was  climbing  a  mountain\r\n\r\ncliff.   Unfortunately,  he got one  arm  caught  in  the\r\n\r\ncrevice.   He  was unable to extricate himself  from  the\r\n\r\nmountain  face.   So  he waited and waited,  waiting  for\r\n\r\nhelp.  Days turned into nights, nights turned into  days.\r\n\r\nHelp  did not come.  People were looking for him but they\r\n\r\ncould  not locate him.  Hope turned to despair.   He  was\r\n\r\ncold,  he  was  hungry, he was tired  and  his  body  was\r\n\r\nbeginning to weaken.  He knew that if help did  not  come\r\n\r\nwithin one or two days, he would be a suspended corpse on\r\n\r\nthe mountain face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hallucinated very often. But in his moment of\r\n\r\nsanity, he decided to do one thing. He decided that  only\r\n\r\nhe could save himself. So he took out his Swiss army\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknife and decided to cut away his arm.  Cutting the  skin\r\n\r\nwas the easy part.  Then, he began to cut his flesh. When\r\n\r\nhe  reached  the  bone, the pain was  excruciating.   The\r\n\r\nSwiss  army knife was a very blunt instrument for cutting\r\n\r\nan  arm.  But because he wanted to live, survival was  on\r\n\r\nhis  mind,  his  family was on his  mind,  the  pain  was\r\n\r\nnothing.   His  will  prevailed.   Eventually,  he  freed\r\n\r\nhimself.  But that was not the end of the story,  because\r\n\r\nhe  was  still in the middle of nowhere.  He had to  walk\r\n\r\nfor  miles  in  the  snow.  He crawled,  he  limped  and,\r\n\r\nfinally,  help  came.  Today, he lives to tell  his  tale\r\n\r\nwith a smile.  Tomorrow, he will climb another mountain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I would like to tell this real\r\n\r\nlife  human  story  to people who are  worried  that  the\r\n\r\nproposed   CPF   cut  will  cause  pain  and   suffering.\r\n\r\nCertainly, there will be pain.  In fact, even without the\r\n\r\nCPF  cut, employers can always cut salaries.  So,  it  is\r\n\r\neither  CPF cut or a cut of total wages through  salaries\r\n\r\nand  bonuses, or through variable bonuses.   And  we  all\r\n\r\nhave  to make adjustments.  All of us have committed  our\r\n\r\nCPF  to housing loans, to our children's study loans  and\r\n\r\nso  on and so forth.  Therefore, we have to rearrange our\r\n\r\nfinances.   But  this is not the end of  the  world.   It\r\n\r\nmight be if we do not do anything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key question we have to ask ourselves is similar\r\n\r\nto  the  question which the mountaineer had to  ask.   He\r\n\r\nasked, \"Would cutting my arm off save my life?\"  We  have\r\n\r\nto  ask a similar question,  whether cutting the CPF will\r\n\r\nresuscitate the economy.  To the mountaineer, the  answer\r\n\r\nis obvious.  Similarly, the answer stares us in the face.\r\n\r\nThe  analogy is not quite complete because we do not lose\r\n\r\nan arm.  He cannot grow back his arm.  He can only use an\r\n\r\nartificial   arm  to  climb  the  next  mountain.    But,\r\n\r\ncollectively, we can recover our losses.  If cutting  the\r\n\r\nCPF restores the economy and the economy grows over time,\r\n\r\nthen total wage would rise and 33% of a higher base would\r\n\r\nprobably  recover  the  3%  loss.   So,  the  faster   we\r\n\r\nimplement  the  CPF  cut,  the faster  we  can  extricate\r\n\r\nourselves from this economic quagmire.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analogy of the mountaineer is useful. If the\r\n\r\nmountaineer  had  been indecisive and  cut  off  his  arm\r\n\r\nlater, he would certainly have bled to death or he  would\r\n\r\nhave starved to death.  To him, it was a very small price\r\n\r\nto pay  -  an arm for a life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us, the consequences are not so severe. Over\r\n\r\ntime, I am sure the economy will restore itself.  And  we\r\n\r\nmust not forget that we had it good for a long time.  The\r\n\r\n40%  CPF  was  riding  on the back of  endless  waves  of\r\n\r\neconomic  tsunami.  So, in absolute terms, we  have  been\r\n\r\ngetting  a  lot  more from our employers.  In  percentage\r\n\r\nterms,  it  had  always been 40% for some time.  But  the\r\n\r\nquestion is:  how soon can we recover?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the good news from my perspective is that we\r\n\r\nhave  not  reached the point of no return.  Our  official\r\n\r\nunemployment rate is 4.5%.   They say it might go to 5.5%\r\n\r\nlater this year or sometime next year.  But this is still\r\n\r\na small figure by developed world standards.  Let us look\r\n\r\nat  Hong Kong, the worst case in this part of the  world.\r\n\r\nHong Kong's unemployment rate, officially, is about 8.7%.\r\n\r\nIt  is  in  a  severe recession.  Of course, that  is  no\r\n\r\ncomfort to us, comparing Singapore to Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at somewhere down south - Australia.\r\n\r\nMany  Singaporeans have been making a beeline  to  go  to\r\n\r\nAustralia for holiday.  Indeed, many have emigrated there\r\n\r\nin  the  last  few years.  Australia is one  of  the  few\r\n\r\nbright  economic spots anywhere in the world today.   Its\r\n\r\ncurrency  has  gone  up by something  like  25%  to  30%,\r\n\r\ndepending at what point we compare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sydney property prices have really shot through the\r\n\r\nroof.  In fact, they sold more million dollar homes  than\r\n\r\nwe  have ever sold in the last three years.  Yet, it  may\r\n\r\nsurprise Singaporeans to learn that unemployment in  boom\r\n\r\ntown Australia is 6.2% today.  They are at the height  of\r\n\r\neconomic prosperity and yet unemployment is 6.2%.  We are\r\n\r\nalmost   at  the  trough  of  the  recession,   but   our\r\n\r\nunemployment is only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n4.5%.   So, we can only improve on 4.5%.  It might go  to\r\n\r\n5.5%, but I think we can improve on this very soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second good news is that we truly have all the\r\n\r\nresources.  What we lack today is the resolve.   All  our\r\n\r\ninfrastructures  are  first class  -  our  roads,   power\r\n\r\nstations,   airports,   housing.   Everything  is   first\r\n\r\nclass.  They have all been paid for and they are all sunk\r\n\r\ncost.   Once  we  adjust the CPF, total  wage  costs  for\r\n\r\nemployers go down, and when Government adjusts  its  fees\r\n\r\ndownwards, I think we will become very competitive.   And\r\n\r\nour  neighbours  better fear for their  shirts.   Because\r\n\r\nwhatever  we  earn  belongs to us.  We  do  not  have  to\r\n\r\nservice  interest payments which our neighbours  have  to\r\n\r\ndo.   Hence, I am very confident that cutting the CPF  is\r\n\r\nthe  right  policy.  Even though using the CPF to  adjust\r\n\r\ntotal wage cost is a very blunt instrument, as Mdm Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker  had spoken yesterday, it is effective, like  the\r\n\r\nmountaineer  who used a Swiss army knife to cut  off  his\r\n\r\narm.   The  Swiss army knife was a very blunt instrument,\r\n\r\nbut it worked at the right time and at the right place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am supporting this policy, not just because\r\n\r\nI  am  in Government  -  I have supported many Government\r\n\r\npolicies  -  but on this point, I am supporting it for my\r\n\r\nchildren.  I am supporting it for our children,  for  our\r\n\r\nfriends  and  for  our relatives.  I know  of  people   - friends,   colleagues,  relatives   -   who   have   been\r\n\r\nunemployed for a long time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About two years ago, one of my very good MPS helper\r\n\r\ntold me, \"Mr Koo, I can't help you any more.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I said, \"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, \"I am going to Australia.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, \"Why would you want to leave?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, \"Actually, I have been unemployed for a\r\n\r\nlong  time.   I have been looking for a job but  I  can't\r\n\r\nfind a job.  I wound down my business.  I sold my car.  I\r\n\r\nsold my flat.  I am left with a little bit of money.   My\r\n\r\nchildren are studying there.  They are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworking there.  It's cheaper for me to go there and  rent\r\n\r\na small flat.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have lost him, but he has not migrated because he\r\n\r\ndoes not qualify to be a migrant.  He is not rich enough.\r\n\r\nSo,  he  is on a social visit pass.  Every time he  comes\r\n\r\nback to Singapore, he comes to my MPS and helps me.   And\r\n\r\nhe  has asked me whether I can help him to get a job.   I\r\n\r\nhave  been trying and I cannot.  All the companies I know\r\n\r\nare actually retrenching people because business has been\r\n\r\npoor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days ago, I had lunch with two ex-colleagues.\r\n\r\nOne  is a 42 year old ex-General Manager of Tanjong Pagar\r\n\r\nTown  Council.  Another is an ex-colleague in the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department, going back almost 20-something  years.\r\n\r\nI  cannot remember the vintage.  The younger ex-colleague\r\n\r\ntold  me that he was clearly worried whether his children\r\n\r\nwould  have  a future in Singapore, with so  many  people\r\n\r\nleaving Singapore or giving up hope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older colleague has two children in Australia - one studying in Melbourne University and the other in\r\n\r\nQueensland University.  But he told me that his  children\r\n\r\nhad told him, \"What should we do if we don't get jobs  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?  Should we stay in Australia?\"  He is  clearly\r\n\r\nworried  because he and his wife want their  children  to\r\n\r\ncome  back to stay in Singapore.  When  we grow  old,  we\r\n\r\nall want our children to come back and stay with us.   We\r\n\r\nall  want  friends to be around.  When our  children  and\r\n\r\nfriends  have  to leave Singapore, not because  they  are\r\n\r\nquitters,  but  because they need to earn  a  living  for\r\n\r\nthemselves, we should sympathise with them.  But  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  it is hard for us to accept that the  people\r\n\r\nclosest  to  us  are forced to leave the country  because\r\n\r\nthey cannot find meaningful jobs here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 60s before I got a scholarship, I was very\r\n\r\ntempted  to  go  to the Philippines for my  undergraduate\r\n\r\nstudies.    Because  at  that  time,  in  the  60s,   the\r\n\r\nPhilippines  was  the  second most developed  economy  in\r\n\r\nAsia.   The  first was Japan.  Today, the Philippines  is\r\n\r\namong one of the poorer countries in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Iraq war broke, the Philippine government\r\n\r\nwas  worried  about two things.  They were worried  about\r\n\r\nthe  lives of the Filipinos in the Middle East, but  they\r\n\r\nwere just as worried over the loss of foreign income from\r\n\r\nthat part of the world, because the Philippine economy is\r\n\r\nnow  heavily  dependent  on  remissions  from  their  own\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the  Middle  East  and  across  the   world,\r\n\r\nincluding a major component from Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reversal of fortune should not be lost on us.\r\n\r\nToday, we are a rich country.  Tomorrow, we should  be  a\r\n\r\nrich  country,  but history has a way  of  turning  hopes\r\n\r\nupside down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, many of us are clearly worried about our\r\n\r\nfuture.   We know that Cabinet, in particular the  senior\r\n\r\nleadership  in  Cabinet, had sleepless  nights  agonising\r\n\r\nover  this policy change.  PM and DPM have revealed  that\r\n\r\nCabinet  agonised  for  at least  two  months  over  this\r\n\r\ndecision.  We are sure that some of the senior leaders in\r\n\r\nCabinet must have agonised long before they even broached\r\n\r\nthe subject to Cabinet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leadership ought to be worried. And this is a\r\n\r\ngood  leadership that worries.  The PAP leadership  lives\r\n\r\nby  its honour code.  What it cannot deliver, it does not\r\n\r\npromise.   What  it promises, it had delivered.   And  on\r\n\r\nthis,  it  has  fallen down.  There was a  commitment  to\r\n\r\nrestore the CPF to 40%.  To break a commitment like  that\r\n\r\nand  reverse  it must have weighed heavily on  them.   It\r\n\r\ncould  not  have been an easy decision for Cabinet.   PM,\r\n\r\nDPM  and several Ministers have come here to explain, and\r\n\r\nin  their explanations, we can feel their sense of burden\r\n\r\nand their sense of worry.  Obviously, they have worried a\r\n\r\nlot  before  they  made  the policy  pronouncement.   The\r\n\r\nChinese  have a saying.  A good leader first worries  and\r\n\r\nthen  enjoys last  -  sian tian zhi xia, you er you,  hou\r\n\r\ntian zhi xia, le er le.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, we can see the agony written all over their\r\n\r\nfaces.   While we should be worried about going  forward,\r\n\r\nhow  to  readjust our finances, we should  also  spare  a\r\n\r\nthought for the senior leaders,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause  history  will have to write the  final  chapter.\r\n\r\nBut I am convinced that history will vindicate them.  And\r\n\r\nI   have  no  doubt  that  history  and  historians  will\r\n\r\nvindicate  this policy U-turn. This policy  U-turn  is  a\r\n\r\nmark  of  political conviction.  It is not  a  course  of\r\n\r\npolitical  convenience.   I  urge  this  House  and   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and those who speak to jiu wu ba  (95.8)  to\r\n\r\nsupport this proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> We will stop here today.
