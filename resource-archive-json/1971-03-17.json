However, this  does\r\n\r\nnot   mean  that  I  fully  endorse  the  measures\r\n\r\nimplemented in the last financial year  and  those\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  implemented in the new financial year. On  the\r\n\r\ncontrary, I would like to take this opportunity to\r\n\r\nexpress my views on certain matters which are  not\r\n\r\naltogether  on  all  fours  with  those   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as a small nation, Singapore is subject to the influence of many extraneous factors which are beyond our control. These factors often affect the decisions that we have to make. The political and economic developments in our neighbouring countries will always have a\r\n\r\ncertain  bearing  and  reaction  in  our  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore, whatever we decide and do, we must  not\r\n\r\noverlook  all  these  extraneous  factors.  To  do\r\n\r\notherwise would be most unwise on our part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance has resorted to a mass of statistics to show how satisfactory our economic growth has been over recent years. I am not an economist, nor am I prepared to degrade myself into becoming a theorist and, in an air-conditioned room, talk\r\n\r\nabout  the  poverty outside. My view is  that  all\r\n\r\nthis talk of economic growth and progress will  be\r\n\r\nentirely  meaningless if they do  not  bring  real\r\n\r\nbenefits and a better life for the general  public\r\n\r\nand  ensure  a  more  equitable  distribution   of\r\n\r\nwealth. If our progress and economic growth  bring\r\n\r\nbenefits only to a small group of people and  make\r\n\r\nthe  few  who are rich richer, that will  generate\r\n\r\nsocial discontent and lead to a latent crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance says that in recent years\r\n\r\nthe prices of commodities in our country have been\r\n\r\nquite   stable  and  that  there   has   been   no\r\n\r\nappreciable increase in the cost of living. Sir, I\r\n\r\ncannot  agree  with him on this. As  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfact, at the very moment when this budget is being\r\n\r\npresented  to  this  House,  there  are  moves  to\r\n\r\nstandardise or adjust commodity prices for various\r\n\r\nreasons. These so-called price standardisation and\r\n\r\nadjustments are nothing more than pronounced price\r\n\r\nincreases.  Unless  we adopt the  attitude  of  an\r\n\r\nostrich,  I  say  that  the  so-called  stabilised\r\n\r\nprices are not borne out by facts. I hope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government will look into this matter and not\r\n\r\navoid  it  and  shirk its responsibility,  because\r\n\r\nthis  matter concerns the livelihood of the people\r\n\r\nin the street. They cannot remain indifferent. The\r\n\r\npresent trend in price increases should be checked\r\n\r\nand  proper attention should be given to it by the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the budget for this year is more or less similar to that of last year and the following points have been stressed. First, the creation of a favourable climate to attract foreign investments. Secondly, the establishment of a sound infrastructure for an industrialised\r\n\r\nstate.   Thirdly,  the  training  of  much  needed\r\n\r\npersonnel, particularly middle level technical and\r\n\r\nmanagerial  personnel  for our  industrialisation.\r\n\r\nFourthly,  the  promotion of tourism  as  well  as\r\n\r\nurban renewal and other development plans. On  the\r\n\r\nface  of it, there is nothing wrong with all these\r\n\r\nmeasures.   For   example,  the  creation   of   a\r\n\r\nfavourable investment climate is conducive to  our\r\n\r\neconomic   development  and  security.  The   more\r\n\r\ninternational consortiums we can attract into  our\r\n\r\ncountry, the greater will be our ability to create\r\n\r\nemployment    opportunities,    develop     higher\r\n\r\ntechnology and promote economic growth. We will be\r\n\r\nable to develop our potential to attract even more\r\n\r\ninvestors  so as to make Singapore the  investors'\r\n\r\nparadise.  They  come  here  not  for  sentimental\r\n\r\nreasons. Furthermore, in their own interest,  they\r\n\r\nwill  ensure  that  we are safe  and  continue  to\r\n\r\nmaintain this stability so as to ensure that their\r\n\r\ninvestments  are safe and have good  prospects.  I\r\n\r\nwould,  however,  remind  the  Government  not  to\r\n\r\noverlook the support and assistance to be given to\r\n\r\nlocal  capital. I feel there is a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\ncapital  which can be tapped locally. Many locally\r\n\r\nfinanced  industries  have,  in  fact,  been  very\r\n\r\nsuccessful in recent years. I would like  to  give\r\n\r\none  example. The Far East Shipbuilding Industries\r\n\r\nin Jurong is a business enterprise financed solely\r\n\r\nby  local capital, which has recently entered into\r\n\r\nan   agreement  with  an  American   company   for\r\n\r\ntechnical co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  shipyard has been  able  to  win\r\n\r\nmulti-million  dollar contracts  for  shipbuilding\r\n\r\nprojects.  The Government has the duty  to  assist\r\n\r\nthis kind of local entrepreneurs with ability  and\r\n\r\nforesight  in  the industrial field,  because  the\r\n\r\nmoment  other countries are able to offer  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  better terms, they will not  remain  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for sentimental reasons. They do not owe\r\n\r\nus  a living. Therefore, in the circumstances,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  short-sighted to ignore the exploitation\r\n\r\nand development of the potential of local capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the assistance which must be given to\r\n\r\nlocal   capital  and  the  attraction  of  foreign\r\n\r\ncapital  into Singapore are complementary to  each\r\n\r\nother. There is nothing inconsistent about that. I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  give yet another example.  Jurong\r\n\r\nShipyard Limited, a joint venture between Japanese\r\n\r\nand  local capital, and its sister company, Jurong\r\n\r\nShipbuilders  Limited - now under  construction  -\r\n\r\nare  dependent  upon  extensive  local  supporting\r\n\r\nindustries   to   be  successful.   Recently   new\r\n\r\nenterprises  have  been  formed  to  provide   con\r\n\r\nsultative and construction services to the setting\r\n\r\nup  of  new  industries, which also need extensive\r\n\r\nsupporting industries. So we should utilise  every\r\n\r\nopportunity  to utilise local capital  to  develop\r\n\r\nsuch supporting industries. In this way we will be\r\n\r\nable  to  increase  employment  opportunities  and\r\n\r\nupgrade  our  technological skill level.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  express  the hope that the  Government's\r\n\r\nplanning   and   efforts  to   train   industrial,\r\n\r\ntechnical,  managerial and  other  personnel  will\r\n\r\nmeet  with the success that they deserve in  order\r\n\r\nto fulfil the needs of our industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has also made reference to tourism. It is a sad thing to see that the Tourist Promotion Board, which has been charged with the duty of promoting tourism, has seen fit to send overseas as a publicity move some temple mediums who actually represent a backward and\r\n\r\nsuperstitious era. Recently the Tourist  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard has even thought of erecting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  kind  of  wax  museum  to  commemorate   the\r\n\r\nhistorical  events  of  the  shameful  deeds   and\r\n\r\natrocities   of   the  Japanese   militarists   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If  members of the  Tourist  Promotion\r\n\r\nBoard are not capable of better ideas than this or\r\n\r\nof  bringing  about  a better publicity  campaign,\r\n\r\nthey  will  have to face the condemnation  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  do a lot of explanation. I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will unreservedly turn down  all  these\r\n\r\nkinds of publicity stunts and proposals which  are\r\n\r\nan  insult  to  the  dignity of  our  people.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I do not deny that the promotion  of\r\n\r\ntourism is important to our economic growth. But I\r\n\r\nthink we have many other better ways of doing  it,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the establishment of bird parks and large\r\n\r\nzoos,  and  the  publicising of our multi-cultural\r\n\r\nand   multi-religious  features,  and  many  other\r\n\r\naspects of local life which will help make tourism\r\n\r\na success. We have indeed a lot to learn from more\r\n\r\nadvanced countries like Japan and Taiwan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to turn now to the Minister's\r\n\r\nremarks on urban renewal. My constituency  is  the\r\n\r\nfirst  to  be affected by urban renewal.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  the people in my constituency have  made\r\n\r\nconsiderable sacrifices for national construction.\r\n\r\nBut  does  the Palembang Housing Estate  -  a  new\r\n\r\nhousing  estate  in  my constituency  -  meet  the\r\n\r\nobjectives behind the urban renewal scheme?  If  a\r\n\r\nsurvey  is made amongst the flat dwellers and  the\r\n\r\ntraders  there,  they will say that  this  housing\r\n\r\nestate is far from satisfactory. They complain  of\r\n\r\ninconvenience in traffic and poor designs  of  the\r\n\r\nflats,  as  a  result of which  tourists  are  not\r\n\r\nattracted there. Because of this, business is very\r\n\r\npoor   in   this  area.  Mind  you,   Sir,   these\r\n\r\nbusinessmen have to pay many times the  rent  that\r\n\r\nthey  used to pay before urban renewal. The people\r\n\r\nliving  there  find  it rather  inconvenient  and,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in times of emergency,  even  police\r\n\r\nvehicles and ambulances find it difficult to go in\r\n\r\nand out of the estate. Is this not contrary to the\r\n\r\nexpectations that we envisage in the renewal plan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to draw a lesson from this\r\n\r\nexperience, i.e., a scheme or a policy may be very\r\n\r\ngood  in  principle,  but  when  it  is  executed,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  so-called experts in charge  of  the\r\n\r\nscheme  are  unaware of the local  conditions  and\r\n\r\nhave  not  taken local factors into  account,  the\r\n\r\nactual result is far from ideal or as expected. It\r\n\r\nis  not too late for us to take remedial action in\r\n\r\nrespect  of future schemes and in their execution.\r\n\r\nWe  must  construct buildings which are in keeping\r\n\r\nwith the requirements of the local people. In this\r\n\r\nrespect, Sir, I am sure the Citizens' Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittee  in each constituency will  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute their views to assist the experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect about urban renewal is the sale of\r\n\r\nland  and the identity of the investors.  On  this\r\n\r\npoint, my former Parliamentary colleague, Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nTeck  Him,  made some worthwhile contributions  in\r\n\r\nlast year's debate. According to present plans, we\r\n\r\nsell  plots of land by open tenders and we provide\r\n\r\nthe best opportunities and facilities for the rich\r\n\r\ndevelopers  to  develop the land.  But  the  small\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  affected  by clearance  exercises  in\r\n\r\nurban  renewal  do  not  get  any  concessions  or\r\n\r\npreference.  I feel this is most unwise.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthe small and medium businessmen affected by urban\r\n\r\nrenewal  in  fact are in a position to pool  their\r\n\r\nresources   and   participate  in  urban   renewal\r\n\r\nprojects. I know of such a plan and of people  not\r\n\r\nonly  in my own constituency but also in two other\r\n\r\nconstituencies  with such plans.  No  doubt,  when\r\n\r\nthey  pool  their  resources,  they  are  able  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  sizable  amount of local  capital  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  purposes.  We  should  support   such\r\n\r\nschemes to invest local capital in the development\r\n\r\nof our country and should also be of help to them.\r\n\r\nIf  we do so, we will not be accused of neglecting\r\n\r\nthem  and favouring the richer developers many  of\r\n\r\nwhom are foreign capitalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a certain trade organisation has expressed\r\n\r\nits   willingness  to  participate   in   such   a\r\n\r\ndevelopment scheme. But a year or more has elapsed\r\n\r\nand  there  has been no answer from the Government\r\n\r\nto the proposal. If I compare the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreatment given to local people and that given  to\r\n\r\nan  American  electronics company which  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven  all the facilities required in the  setting\r\n\r\nup  of the industry within six weeks, I feel  hurt\r\n\r\nand ashamed of the \"efficiency\" of the Government.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible explanations for this.  One\r\n\r\nexplanation is that we are totally uninterested in\r\n\r\nthe  investment of local capital and will not give\r\n\r\nit  any  encouragement. The other  explanation  is\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  over-interested in foreign  capital\r\n\r\nwhich  is interested in us because we can  provide\r\n\r\nit  with cheap labour. We are afraid that if we do\r\n\r\nnot  welcome  foreign investors  enthusiastically,\r\n\r\nthey will hesitate to come here. I do not think it\r\n\r\nis  the  intended  policy of our  intelligent  and\r\n\r\nhonourable   Minister   for   Law   and   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment. But I do not appreciate the doings of\r\n\r\nsome experts in his Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking about experts brings me to another\r\n\r\nthought  about  the trend in our midst  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears. Many people have faith in these experts  as\r\n\r\nthough they can provide them with all the panaceas\r\n\r\nin  the world. I would remind those concerned that\r\n\r\nonly  those  who  are really aware  of  the  basic\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  life of our people  are  fit  to\r\n\r\npropose  plans  for  reform.  Those  scholars  and\r\n\r\nexperts who sit in air-conditioned rooms and  talk\r\n\r\nabout the hot weather and the plight of the hungry\r\n\r\npeople  outside  must leave their  air-conditioned\r\n\r\nrooms   if  they  wish  to  understand  our  local\r\n\r\nconditions  and  get the views of  the  people  at\r\n\r\ngrass-root   level  before  they  can   make   any\r\n\r\nproposals or plans worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I started speaking I mentioned the\r\n\r\ngreat  effect of extraneous factors on us. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  come back to this subject. The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance has also concurred on this point.  He\r\n\r\nhas    particularly   emphasised   the   potential\r\n\r\ninfluence of Japan as an industrial power  on  the\r\n\r\neconomic development of this region. He shows very\r\n\r\ngood understanding in this connection. But no word\r\n\r\nhas  been  mentioned about another great power  in\r\n\r\nAsia  - I refer to the People's Republic of China.\r\n\r\nOf course, the People's Republic of China, with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nher  great land and human resources, will have  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  her political and military  obligations\r\n\r\nas  a super power in the international arena. Sir,\r\n\r\nI  have in this House requested the Government  to\r\n\r\nreappraise and readjust the relations that we have\r\n\r\nwith   China,  and  I  would  like  to  urge   the\r\n\r\nGovernment again to initiate positive and  correct\r\n\r\nsteps  towards this end. There is no denying  that\r\n\r\nChina's  joining  the United  Nations  depends  on\r\n\r\nwhether she will get any benefit from such a move.\r\n\r\nNobody can stop China from expanding her influence\r\n\r\nin South-east Asia. If our policy runs contrary to\r\n\r\nthis  inevitable  trend, then it  will  be  of  no\r\n\r\nbenefit to us. China may become a great market for\r\n\r\nthe  primary produce of this region. This will  be\r\n\r\nof benefit to Singapore. Many people may feel that\r\n\r\nit  would be unwise for us to be too friendly with\r\n\r\nChina because the majority of the population  here\r\n\r\nare  of  Chinese origin. I do not agree with  this\r\n\r\nview.  I was born and brought up in Singapore.  If\r\n\r\nSingapore fails, I have no other place to turn to.\r\n\r\nSo nobody can accuse me of speaking for Peking.  I\r\n\r\nmay  not  endorse  the  policies  that  are  being\r\n\r\nimplemented in that country. At the same  time,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  believe  that  China  will  come  to  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of  Singapore  simply  because  it  is\r\n\r\nlargely  populated with people of  Chinese  origin\r\n\r\nwhen  we  get into difficulties, unless China  can\r\n\r\nbenefit  from such assistance given. My  point  is\r\n\r\nthat after years of hard struggle, China will  now\r\n\r\nassert  her rights in the international arena  and\r\n\r\ndischarge  her  obligations as a great  power  and\r\n\r\nlook  after  her own interests and strengthen  her\r\n\r\ninfluence in this region. We cannot overlook  this\r\n\r\nimportant  foreign  factor.  We  must   take   the\r\n\r\ninitiative  and make preparations for  any  future\r\n\r\npossible development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another extraneous political factor which deserves our attention is the co-operation we must have with our neighbouring countries. At the present stage, we hope to promote co-operation with our neighbours through regional mutual benefit schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut have the principles and objectives of this co-operation   been   defined?  Are   they   mutually\r\n\r\nacceptable  to both? We must not forget  that  any\r\n\r\npolitical  development in  the  peninsula  to  the\r\n\r\nnorth  of  us  will  definitely affect  our  small\r\n\r\nisland   state.  Have  we  honestly   sought   for\r\n\r\nopportunities for co-operation with our  neighbour\r\n\r\non  a  mutually acceptable basis and tried to sink\r\n\r\nour differences while maintaining concord and come\r\n\r\nto  some  kind of co-operative arrangements  which\r\n\r\nare mutually beneficial for our two peoples?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we also cannot overlook the development of\r\n\r\nracial  politics  in  the  neighbouring  countries\r\n\r\nwhich will have a certain reaction from us. As  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  in multi-racialism, our reaction to  such\r\n\r\ndevelopment must be rational and be based  on  our\r\n\r\naccepted principles of multi-racialism. I hope our\r\n\r\npeople,  particularly the press, will avoid  being\r\n\r\ndragged  into expressing some kind of chauvinistic\r\n\r\nfeelings. Certain of our local newspapers  have  a\r\n\r\ntendency to whip up chauvinistic feelings, perhaps\r\n\r\nunwittingly or for business reasons. I do not want\r\n\r\nto  over-stress this point. It will be  dangerous.\r\n\r\nSir,   I   am   not  very  optimistic  about   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of our relationship with neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries.  In  fact, I can  see  that  some  dark\r\n\r\nclouds   are  already  looming  over  the  distant\r\n\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government is a socialist government. The interests of the workers must be protected. I welcome the Government's intention to strengthen the Factory Inspectorate in order to promote the safety of the workers. In fact, this should have been done long ago. The Chief\r\n\r\nInspector of Factories has been able to work under\r\n\r\nthe most unfavourable and strenuous conditions  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  and we should give him the commendation\r\n\r\nthat is due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about industrial safety brings me to\r\n\r\nanother  matter. When we relate the story  of  our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation success, we must not  forget  to\r\n\r\npay  a  tribute  to the workers  at  the  workshop\r\n\r\nlevel, because without their sacrifices and  their\r\n\r\nefforts, we will not have attained\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  present position. I  have  some  rough\r\n\r\nstatistics to prove that those who are standing in\r\n\r\nthe  forefront  of industrialisation  come  mainly\r\n\r\nfrom  those  educated in their own mother  tongue.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  great tribute that  we  must  pay  to\r\n\r\neducation  in the mother tongue. Through education\r\n\r\nin  the mother tongue, we have been able to  bring\r\n\r\nup  a  generation  of patriotic  and  hard-working\r\n\r\nindustrial  workers  who are responsible  for  the\r\n\r\nhappiness  and  well-being of our  country.  Their\r\n\r\ncontribution  to our country is too  great  to  be\r\n\r\ndenied. If anybody tries to deny this, it will  be\r\n\r\na great insult to our republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a young country. Our youths are a source of great strength. We must spare no effort to tap this source. However, history shows that any society of people who only care to enjoy life and nothing else will, in the end, become a soulless one and collapse. More than\r\n\r\na decade ago the People's Action Party was able to\r\n\r\nprovide our youth with the right objective in life\r\n\r\n-  to  contribute  towards  nation  building.  The\r\n\r\nsituation  today is quite different from  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  past. Our Government must not forget to guide\r\n\r\nour youths along the proper path to understand and\r\n\r\ncultivate  the  right attitude  in  life,  and  to\r\n\r\ninculcate in them the correct ideals about  a  new\r\n\r\nlife  and not ask them to be docile fancy fish.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  it  is  most regrettable that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned nothing about this aspect. It  must\r\n\r\ngive  active  consideration  to  the  problems  of\r\n\r\nyouths in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people in this region may be classified into two groups -- the forward-looking modernisers and the backward traditionalists. I believe that we today belong to the first category, and we want to be treated as such. We have to be prepared, within the shortest possible time, for the worst situation that may\r\n\r\noccur.  Our  economic policy must be geared  along\r\n\r\nthese lines. Our success depends on our ability to\r\n\r\nbring about a more just and more fair society  for\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of  our people,  and  not  work  on\r\n\r\nstatistics alone. Given\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproper   supervision  and  time  to  our   present\r\n\r\nGovernment and with the established spirit of  PAP\r\n\r\nleadership   courageously  wiping  out   all   the\r\n\r\nopportunists in Singapore at all levels, there  is\r\n\r\nno reason why we cannot succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  when  the  Minister  for   Finance\r\n\r\nannounced  in the House on the 8th of  this  month\r\n\r\nthat Singapore was not going to have any new taxes\r\n\r\nor increase in taxes in the coming financial year,\r\n\r\nall the people in Singapore received the news with\r\n\r\ngreat  joy. Indeed, he brought tremendous news  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore. This has  stimulated  a\r\n\r\nspirit of self-reliance and perseverance among the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore and has encouraged  them  to\r\n\r\nwork even harder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the countries which have become independent\r\n\r\nafter the Second World War, very few of them  have\r\n\r\nbeen fortunate enough to be able to afford such  a\r\n\r\npainless budget as ours. If we examine the reasons\r\n\r\nfor our success, we will find that in the last  10\r\n\r\nyears  or  so,  our  Government  has  put   up   a\r\n\r\ncreditable performance. It has established a clean\r\n\r\nand efficient government and has helped the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore in overcoming their difficulties, in\r\n\r\ncreating  a  new  environment, and in  encouraging\r\n\r\nthem  to strive for a better future. On the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the  people of Singapore have  worked  very\r\n\r\nhard  and  have  shown a spirit of  endeavour  and\r\n\r\nperseverance. This surely must go down in  history\r\n\r\nas a great performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has progressed from strength to strength for many years now. We have received news of one success after another. If we look at the newly emergent countries, we will find that many of them, especially in the Sixties, faced chaos and experienced great disappointment\r\n\r\nafter  their  independence.  Only  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore can \"thumbs up\" and say that in the last\r\n\r\n10  years they have surmounted their difficulties.\r\n\r\nThey are approaching an even brighter and glorious\r\n\r\nfuture. In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  last few years, they have had the benefit  of\r\n\r\npainless budgets which have brought honour to  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  Despite  this, many people  have  voiced\r\n\r\ntheir  discontent. What is the  reason  for  this?\r\n\r\nThere  must  be  a reason. As the  Chinese  saying\r\n\r\ngoes,  \"There  can be no wave without  the  wind.\"\r\n\r\nPeople  in the lower income group, especially  the\r\n\r\nwage-earners,  have  to draw  up  their  household\r\n\r\nbudget  too.  Of  course,  their  budget  is   not\r\n\r\ncomparable  to the momentous one for  the  country\r\n\r\ndrawn  up by the Minister for Finance. The people,\r\n\r\non  the  whole, are not concerned with development\r\n\r\nprojects as such. They are not concerned  so  much\r\n\r\nwith  the  increase  of taxes  or  new  tax  rates\r\n\r\nbecause  their household budget is  based  on  the\r\n\r\nrise  or fall of the general price level. A  small\r\n\r\nnumber  of  unscrupulous merchants  have  recently\r\n\r\nraised  the  prices  of many  goods  without  good\r\n\r\nreasons.  This has caused great hardships  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  This  is even worse than an  increase  in\r\n\r\ntaxes.  It is a most distressing thing to witness.\r\n\r\nWhat is worse is that these unscrupulous merchants\r\n\r\nhave put the blame squarely on the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a fact that prices have increased tremendously in the last few years. The increase in the price level has been a general one, including prices for all the daily necessities: for example, tinned food, fish,\r\n\r\nvegetables, bread and so on. Even bus  fares  have\r\n\r\ngone up! There is indeed a general increase in the\r\n\r\nprice  level. Unscrupulous merchants  have  raised\r\n\r\nprices  under the guise of price adjustments,  but\r\n\r\nprice  adjustments  are equivalent  to  price  in-increases.   We   have  never   yet   seen   price\r\n\r\nadjustments  leading  to a  downward  revision  of\r\n\r\nprices.  It  is  only now that I understand  price\r\n\r\nadjustments to be synonymous with price increases.\r\n\r\nIt  is a new term for price increases. Nowadays we\r\n\r\noften  hear  that  this  or  that  price  must  be\r\n\r\nadjusted, but we have not heard that the employers\r\n\r\nare  going  to adjust the wages of their  workers.\r\n\r\nLet   us  take,  for  example,  the  salaries   of\r\n\r\nteachers. The previous Minister for Education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromised  the  teachers  salary  adjustments,  but\r\n\r\nnothing has happened although the relevant  bodies\r\n\r\nsubmitted their recommendations six months ago. As\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  saying goes, \"We can only  hear  the\r\n\r\nfootsteps on the staircase, but we never  see  the\r\n\r\npeople coming down.\" If we do not adjust the wages\r\n\r\nof  the  working class in the face of the  general\r\n\r\nincrease in the price level, this will lead  to  a\r\n\r\nfall in their income. It is for this reason that I\r\n\r\nwould   like  to  represent  the  people   in   my\r\n\r\nconstituency  and thank the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nwho  has  brought us this good news of a  painless\r\n\r\nbudget. I would also like to express the hope that\r\n\r\na permanent price control committee will be set up\r\n\r\nto  prevent  unscrupulous merchants  from  raising\r\n\r\nprices without valid reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nno  piece of information was more welcome  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore than the declaration  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance in this House  on  the  8th\r\n\r\nMarch   that  no  new  taxation  measures,  either\r\n\r\ndirectly or indirectly, would be introduced in the\r\n\r\nensuing  financial year. The fact that the current\r\n\r\nneeds    for   both   ordinary   and   development\r\n\r\nexpenditures can be met from the natural  increase\r\n\r\nin  the  existing tax yields as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nrapid economic growth is eloquent testimony to the\r\n\r\nsoundness  and foresight of the economic  planning\r\n\r\nand   expansion  programmes  laid  down   by   his\r\n\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the local newspapers have popularly\r\n\r\ntermed  the budget a painless one. That  it  would\r\n\r\nbring about \"no harm\" or \"unhappiness\" to the  man\r\n\r\nin  the street is an undeniable fact. Nonetheless,\r\n\r\naffluent employers have more cause to celebrate by\r\n\r\nreason of the tremendously \"good cheer\" the budget\r\n\r\ngave to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the fact that no new taxes will be\r\n\r\nimposed  on the excessively huge profits that  the\r\n\r\nemployers make, they are now to receive a new  tax\r\n\r\nrelief in that Government will use the proceeds of\r\n\r\nthe existing payroll tax to defray their liability\r\n\r\nin respect of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"make-up\"  pay  of their employees doing  national\r\n\r\nservice,  and  to  reimburse  their  expenses   in\r\n\r\noperating    approved    training    schemes    or\r\n\r\napprenticeship  schemes for their employees.  Such\r\n\r\ntax relief, according to the Finance Minister,  is\r\n\r\nto  lighten the so-called burden of the  employers\r\n\r\nin these two areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions that immediately strike my mind are\r\n\r\n(1) What is this so-called burden of the employers\r\n\r\nfor  which the Minister has such great solicitude?\r\n\r\n(2)  Should the Government lighten this  so-called\r\n\r\nburden of the employers with public funds that may\r\n\r\nbe  better  utilised for some  other  more  worthy\r\n\r\npurposes?  I  cannot emphasise too  strongly  that\r\n\r\nevery  tax relief is tantamount to a payment  from\r\n\r\nthe  public funds, since the principal  source  of\r\n\r\npublic funds is taxation in one form or other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has proposed that employers\r\n\r\nare  entitled to use public funds to pay  part  of\r\n\r\ntheir  workers'  wages for which they  are  liable\r\n\r\nunder  the  National Service Act. It appears  that\r\n\r\nworkers  are  expected, as a matter  of  fact,  to\r\n\r\nsacrifice  two  or three years of their  youth  in\r\n\r\nnational service. But when it comes to the turn of\r\n\r\nemployers  to make a bit of sacrifice, it  appears\r\n\r\nthat  they are a different breed entirely, and  so\r\n\r\nare  not  governed  by the same considerations  of\r\n\r\nnational   interest   as  their   less   fortunate\r\n\r\nemployees. It is of immaterial consequence to such\r\n\r\nemployers  that  the  whole and  sole  purpose  of\r\n\r\nnational  service is not for the martial glory  of\r\n\r\nSingapore but for its defence and protection as  a\r\n\r\nsovereign  political entity and the protection  of\r\n\r\nthe lives and property of the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  would have thought that employers stood to lose\r\n\r\nmost  if Singapore had no credible defence  system\r\n\r\nto  deter any would-be aggressor. But the mind  of\r\n\r\nemployers,  obviously, functions  in  a  different\r\n\r\nmanner.  They  can  perceive no  contradiction  in\r\n\r\nsupporting  national service when  only  employees\r\n\r\nare  affected, and in agitating against the burden\r\n\r\nof  make-up  pay for their workers doing  national\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should think that no one in this House, least\r\n\r\nof  all  the representatives of employers, expects\r\n\r\nemployers  to  take  the lead  in  expressing  and\r\n\r\nproving   their  patriotism.  But  their  churlish\r\n\r\nreaction to the slight obligation they must incur,\r\n\r\nby way of contributions towards the defence of the\r\n\r\ncountry, comes as a definite surprise. The workers\r\n\r\nare   making   great   personal   sacrifices    by\r\n\r\nshouldering the burden of national service.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the sentiments of patriotism that cause them\r\n\r\nto  respond with enthusiasm to the call of service\r\n\r\nto  their country, they have no property or wealth\r\n\r\nof  their  own  to defend. On the other  hand,  if\r\n\r\nsomething  should  happen to Singapore,  employers\r\n\r\nhave  a  lot  to  lose apart from  their  valuable\r\n\r\nlives. They apparently want to have their cake and\r\n\r\neat  it  too.  The petty attitude of employers  is\r\n\r\nmost  ridiculous, considering that their so-called\r\n\r\nburden  under  the  National Service  Act  is  too\r\n\r\ninsignificant to talk about. The amount  of  money\r\n\r\nthat an employer has to give by way of the make-up\r\n\r\npay  is  probably  negligible in relation  to  his\r\n\r\ntotal  profits or assets. Employers have no reason\r\n\r\nto  grudge  the  payment of insurance  premium  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of their property. In fact, they consider\r\n\r\nit  good and sound business practice to have  such\r\n\r\ninsurance   cover.  It  is,  therefore,  extremely\r\n\r\nunreasonable  for  them  to  grudge  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nnational service which is, after all, the best and\r\n\r\nmost comprehensive form of insurance that they can\r\n\r\nobtain  for  their property, their livelihood,  or\r\n\r\nprofit-making enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to the question of training schemes\r\n\r\nfor  the improvement of skills of workers and  the\r\n\r\noffsetting  of  their  training  expenses  against\r\n\r\ntheir payroll tax. I find it difficult to believe,\r\n\r\nby any stretch of imagination, that anyone has the\r\n\r\ngall  to  claim  that any scheme  to  improve  the\r\n\r\nskills  of workers is more a burden than a benefit\r\n\r\nto  their  employers.  All  training  schemes  are\r\n\r\ndesigned  for one primary objective -  to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  skills and efficiency of workers so that they\r\n\r\nmay  be able to contribute more effectively to the\r\n\r\nprofit-making\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncapacity  of their employers. Employers to  enable\r\n\r\ntheir  workers to acquire greater skills for their\r\n\r\nown   good  do  not  establish  training  schemes.\r\n\r\nGranted  that it is true the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nmight  have been induced to allow such tax  relief\r\n\r\nby  reason  of  the undertaking of a  few  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  to  train  more workers  than  required\r\n\r\nunder  their own training schemes, but it will  be\r\n\r\nmost  unfair  for  such  employers,  who  are  co-operating  with the Government, to bear the  brunt\r\n\r\nof  training more workers than is necessary.  This\r\n\r\ninducement  to industrialists to train workers  is\r\n\r\nnot desirable as long as there is this problem  of\r\n\r\na  vicious  cycle  of  a  consequent  shortage  of\r\n\r\nskilled  workers  resulting from the  practice  of\r\n\r\npoaching of such workers. The solution proposed by\r\n\r\nthe Minister is not necessarily the most equitable\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution of allowing employers tax relief\r\n\r\nagainst  their  payroll  tax  liability  for   the\r\n\r\npurpose   of  increasing  the  supply  of  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  is  a negative approach since it  entails\r\n\r\nthe  use of public funds. It must not be forgotten\r\n\r\nthat  while  Singapore stands to  benefit  from  a\r\n\r\ngreater  supply of skilled workers, the  employers\r\n\r\nthemselves benefit directly from it. In fact, they\r\n\r\nhave  the  first  call upon the  services  of  the\r\n\r\nskilled  workers  in  such  increased  supply.   A\r\n\r\npositive  approach would be to apportion the  cost\r\n\r\nof  training extra workers among all employers  or\r\n\r\nthose  employers  without  any  approved  training\r\n\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers have done more than their share in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  industrialisation  programme.  Seldom\r\n\r\ndoes  a  day pass by without a report of a  worker\r\n\r\nbeing   involved   in   an  industrial   accident,\r\n\r\nsometimes   fatal.  Whether   he   dies,   or   is\r\n\r\npermanently or temporarily incapacitated,  he  and\r\n\r\nhis   dependants   can   only   expect   miserable\r\n\r\ncompensation   under   the   Outdated    Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation Ordinance. Even then, some  employers\r\n\r\ntry to wriggle out of their liability under it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have thought that if the Government is\r\n\r\nembarrassed by the sum of money in the coffers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Treasury  accumulated from the  payroll  tax,\r\n\r\nsome arrangement could be made to dispose of it in\r\n\r\na  constructive  manner, such  as  to  help  those\r\n\r\npersons who require assistance most, and not  give\r\n\r\nemployers  the  opportunity  to  use  the  savings\r\n\r\nprovided   by  the  tax  relief  to  employ   more\r\n\r\naccountants  to think of more ways to  evade  tax.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  have  in mind is the channelling  of  the\r\n\r\nproceeds of the payroll tax into a special fund to\r\n\r\nsupplement  or  enhance  the  payments  under  the\r\n\r\nWorkmen's  Compensation  Ordinance.  The   crucial\r\n\r\nquestion is, who needs tax relief most? Is it  the\r\n\r\nemployers, who are only concerned with  the  extra\r\n\r\nsayings  from  tax,  or  the  employees,  who  are\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  their  livelihood  and,  perhaps,\r\n\r\ntheir very own lives?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While incentives have to be offered to foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  to help our industrialisation programme\r\n\r\nsucceed,  it does not mean that we have to  pamper\r\n\r\nthem,  as  they  stand to benefit  more  from  the\r\n\r\nindustrialisation    programme.    Pampering    of\r\n\r\nemployers is more likely to create dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nthan  promote contentment among their own workers.\r\n\r\nIt is meaningless for workers to regard themselves\r\n\r\nas contributors to Singapore's future progress and\r\n\r\nprosperity when their employers make it a point to\r\n\r\ntaunt  them  to  their  faces  with  the  laws  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  which, they say, preclude  the  workers\r\n\r\nfrom  having  a  fair share of the fruits  of  the\r\n\r\nprosperity to which they have greatly contributed.\r\n\r\nThe  problem  today  is not  only  one  of  simply\r\n\r\neducating   our  workers  and  trade   unions   to\r\n\r\nunderstand the realities of our economic life,  as\r\n\r\nsuggested  by the Finance Minister, but  also  the\r\n\r\nmuch  more difficult one of educating some of  our\r\n\r\nunenlightened employers to realise  the  folly  of\r\n\r\ntheir persistent refusal to see beyond their  nose\r\n\r\nthat  their  true interest also lies in  the  fair\r\n\r\ntreatment of their workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the current industrial dispute\r\n\r\nbetween  the Singapore Bank Employees'  Union  and\r\n\r\nthe   various  banking  corporations.   With   the\r\n\r\nexception of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Asia Commercial Bank and the Far Eastern Bank,\r\n\r\nall  the other banks, both foreign and local,  are\r\n\r\nexploiting the provisions of the Employment Act by\r\n\r\nblackmailing  the Singapore Bank Employees'  Union\r\n\r\ninto  signing  away their right to  share  in  the\r\n\r\nmounting profits for the next five years. Everyone\r\n\r\nknows that there has been an enormous increase  in\r\n\r\nthe  turnover,  volume  and profitability  of  the\r\n\r\nbanking  business over the last  few  years.  This\r\n\r\nincrease  has resulted partly from the efforts  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to develop Singapore  and  partly\r\n\r\nfrom  the co-operation of the workers. It  is  not\r\n\r\nsolely   due   to  the  genius  of   the   banking\r\n\r\nmanagement.  The Union is merely asking  that  the\r\n\r\nadditional month's bonus offered to bank employees\r\n\r\nbe  reviewed  annually by the banks in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith the continuing profitability or otherwise  of\r\n\r\nbanking  operations  in Singapore.  The  concerted\r\n\r\nresponse of the banks, both foreign and local,  is\r\n\r\nthe offer of a once-and-for-all payment equivalent\r\n\r\nto an additional month's salary, on condition that\r\n\r\nthe union signs a \"no-change\" collective agreement\r\n\r\nfor  the  next  five years. This is tantamount  to\r\n\r\nblackmailing  the  Union  into  signing  away  the\r\n\r\nrights of the bank employees in Singapore to  have\r\n\r\na share in the profits over the next five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you may be aware that the trade unions were assured in 1968 that the increase in the maximum duration of collective agreements from three to five years was intended to ensure wage stability in the pioneer industries. We had assumed, therefore, that old established\r\n\r\ninstitutions  like  the banks would  not  seek  to\r\n\r\nabuse  the Employment Act by taking full advantage\r\n\r\nof  the provision intended for pioneer industries.\r\n\r\nLocal employers generally have up to now been much\r\n\r\nmore  ready  than  foreign employers  to  come  to\r\n\r\nprofit-sharing arrangements with their  employees.\r\n\r\nIn the recent past, the foreign banks have managed\r\n\r\nto  infect several local banks also with the  same\r\n\r\nvirus of industrial blackmail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"Lever\" virus, also known as the `Gould\"\r\n\r\nvirus, or the \"Rattray\" virus,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich manifests itself in an obstinate refusal  to\r\n\r\nallow  bank employees even a minimal share in  the\r\n\r\nexceptional profits the banks have been making  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  few  years  from  Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth and development, has also spread to several\r\n\r\nlocal banks. The result is that a united front has\r\n\r\nbeen  established  between the presidents  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Chamber of Commerce and the International\r\n\r\nChamber of Commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For employers such as those Shylock bankers who\r\n\r\nconstrue the Employment Act as entitling  them  to\r\n\r\ntheir   pound  of  their  employees'  flesh,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment should not hesitate to exact from  them\r\n\r\na   similar  and  appropriate  penalty  for  their\r\n\r\navarice.  Perhaps  the  time  has  come  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to  consider  making  the   following\r\n\r\namendments to the present labour legislation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Reducing the maximum duration of collective\r\n\r\nagreements from five years to three years in  non-pioneer industries and enterprises;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Raising the maximum limit for the\r\n\r\nnegotiability of bonus payments from  one  month's\r\n\r\nsalary  to  a more realistic sum, particularly  in\r\n\r\nthe case of undertakings which, such as the banks,\r\n\r\nhave made exceptional profits; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Raising the employers' contributions under\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Provident Fund  Ordinance  from  the\r\n\r\npresent  10  per cent to 15 per cent and  reducing\r\n\r\nthe workers' contributions from the present 10 per\r\n\r\ncent  to  5 per cent, thus increasing the  present\r\n\r\ntake-home  pay of the workers by 5 per cent.  This\r\n\r\nmay  be termed a \"built-in\" wage increase of 5 per\r\n\r\ncent all round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.32 p.m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the Minister for Finance has given us welcome\r\n\r\nnews  in  his well-presented budget. Economically,\r\n\r\nwe  have done better than we expected and  we  can\r\n\r\napproach  the coming year with cautious  optimism.\r\n\r\nCuriously, however, our performance over the  last\r\n\r\nthree  years of some 15 per cent of growth a  year\r\n\r\nin the Gross Domestic Product, one\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the highest growth rates in the world, has been\r\n\r\ndescribed  by many commentators as a mini-boom.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  what a regular or a maxi-boom  would  look\r\n\r\nlike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me comment first on the Minister's proposal\r\n\r\nto  formulate an optimum investment policy. He has\r\n\r\nrightly  emphasized  two  elements;  firstly,  the\r\n\r\nattention   to   selectivity  in   promoting   new\r\n\r\nindustries,  where  priority is  to  be  given  to\r\n\r\nindustries  with  higher  technology,  established\r\n\r\nworld  markets, and the ability to utilize  higher\r\n\r\ngrades  of skilled labour. Secondly, the  Minister\r\n\r\nraised  the important question of training skilled\r\n\r\nlabour. Contrary to the view of my colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Moulmein, I think that the proposed use\r\n\r\nof  the  payroll  tax  is an excellent  idea.  The\r\n\r\npayroll  tax  itself is an anomaly in a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere we are trying to create employment, so  that\r\n\r\nthe  optimum policy is a subsidy rather than a tax\r\n\r\non  the use of labour. The use of the tax proceeds\r\n\r\nto   finance  the  training  of  skilled   labour,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  makes economic sense. In  addition  to\r\n\r\nthe   specific   proposals  for  training   labour\r\n\r\noutlined by the Minister, consideration should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  proper vocational guidance in  schools,\r\n\r\nand  at  the  Ministry  of  Defence  for  national\r\n\r\nservicemen  who are about to be discharged.  I  am\r\n\r\ntold that one of the most keenly sought jobs,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  is  that of hotel toilet-attendants  who\r\n\r\ncan  expect  good  tips by  turning  on  taps  and\r\n\r\nhanding  out  towels.  Now I  cannot  imagine  how\r\n\r\nproductivity can increase in such occupations!  We\r\n\r\nhave  got to get our young people used to the idea\r\n\r\nof forgoing some earnings during a training period\r\n\r\nof two to three years, but with the expectation of\r\n\r\na  higher earnings profile later. The only way  to\r\n\r\ninduce such a sense of the long-term is to provide\r\n\r\nvocational guidance, where lectures are  given  on\r\n\r\ndifferent career prospects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two elements of industrial\r\n\r\nselection  and  labour training mentioned  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister, I would advocate attention to six  other\r\n\r\nfactors in framing an optimum investment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy:  First  of all is the nurturing  of  local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship. As I have indicated  on  another\r\n\r\noccasion, our emphasis on export orientation poses\r\n\r\na  number  of challenges to our entrepreneurs.  In\r\n\r\nthe first place, an enterprise has to be efficient\r\n\r\nin  order  to  compete successfully  with  foreign\r\n\r\ngoods in terms of price and quality. Secondly,  to\r\n\r\nexport  success-fully, entrepreneurs must  acquire\r\n\r\nthe  marketing  techniques of  advertising,  trade\r\n\r\nmissions and exhibitions abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign investors come in with a ready\r\n\r\ntechnology,  managerial  capability,   and   well-established  marketing channels abroad.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nthe  kinds  of  foreign investment  we  have  been\r\n\r\ngetting  lately  are  large.  Indeed,  the  recent\r\n\r\namendment  to the Economic Expansion  Act  favours\r\n\r\nthe  bigger-sized establishments,  quite  rightly,\r\n\r\nfrom  our economy's standpoint. However, we should\r\n\r\nrecognise that the local entrepreneur is put at  a\r\n\r\nrelative  disadvantage. He has limited  access  to\r\n\r\ntechnology,   his   concept  of  organisation   is\r\n\r\nrelatively  primitive, his capital  resources  are\r\n\r\nrather   slender,  and  he  does  not   have   the\r\n\r\nestablished  marketing channels abroad.  A  purely\r\n\r\nnationalistic reaction would be to close the doors\r\n\r\nto   foreign  investment  and  adopt  an   import-substitution  policy. This would,  however,  be  a\r\n\r\ntremendous disaster to Singapore. The key to  full\r\n\r\nemployment and higher standards of living  in  our\r\n\r\nsituation lies in our present open-door policy  to\r\n\r\nboth trade and foreign investment. But from a long-term point of view, it is desirable that we try to\r\n\r\nnurture  a corps of local entrepreneurs. This  can\r\n\r\nbest be done by, first of all, helping those local\r\n\r\nindustries  which  are  thriving  and  which  have\r\n\r\npotential   for   expansion   to   secure   better\r\n\r\ntechnology   and   organisation.   There   is    a\r\n\r\ndistressing   propensity  on  the  part   of   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Bank  of  Singapore  and  the   Light\r\n\r\nIndustries  Services  to  waste  time,  money  and\r\n\r\neffort  in  attempting to rescue industries  which\r\n\r\nare incurable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also advocated more credit availability to\r\n\r\nour  local industries and I note with approval the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  an additional $96  million  to  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBank  of Singapore. Government  should  also\r\n\r\nhelp   local  industries  in  learning   marketing\r\n\r\ntechniques,  promote mergers of existing  concerns\r\n\r\ninto bigger and more efficient establishments, and\r\n\r\nhelp  local  industrialists to identify worthwhile\r\n\r\ninvestment opportunities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor is what I call the avoidance of\r\n\r\nwage distortions in the economy. In a situation of\r\n\r\nrapid industrialization, wage patterns tend to get\r\n\r\ngrossly  distorted unless there is proper  meshing\r\n\r\nof  supply and demand. Even if the general  policy\r\n\r\nof  wage  restraint  is effective,  there  can  be\r\n\r\nconsiderable  wage  movements  within  the   given\r\n\r\nscales brought about by the mobility of labour and\r\n\r\nthe  variability  of  entry  points.  There  must,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  be  a national manpower  co-ordinating\r\n\r\nbody  monitoring  wage movements, checking  labour\r\n\r\nsupply developments, and attempting to synchronise\r\n\r\nwith  demand for various types of skills.  I  have\r\n\r\nargued at Economic Development Board meetings  for\r\n\r\nsuch a body, since we can assemble the information\r\n\r\non  projects in the pipe-lines, and we can require\r\n\r\nprospective investors to indicate the type and the\r\n\r\nvolume of skills required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy with regard to wage increases has been\r\n\r\nthat   they   should  be  tied   to   productivity\r\n\r\nincreases.  The  problem of how to  implement  the\r\n\r\nidea  fairly is still being worked out. Hopefully,\r\n\r\nthe  reorganisation  of the National  Productivity\r\n\r\nCentre  should  help in this direction.  I  should\r\n\r\nemphasize,  though,  that the  avoidance  of  wage\r\n\r\ndistortions   is   a   macro-problem   and   takes\r\n\r\nprecedence  over  intra- and  inter-industry  wage\r\n\r\nadjustments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I come now to the third factor, and that is, attention to the cost of living. Singapore is probably the envy of other countries since our cost of living has been exceptionally slow in rising. However, we cannot expect this happy state of affairs to last much longer as\r\n\r\ninflation in other countries is bound to have  its\r\n\r\nimpact  on us in due course, because we have  such\r\n\r\nan open economy. Moreover, as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nan  academic colleague of mine has rightly pointed\r\n\r\nout,  we  are  still using the budget  weights  of\r\n\r\n1960!  Since then, our per capita income has  more\r\n\r\nthan  doubled.  As  people's  incomes  rise,   the\r\n\r\nproportions   of  expenditures  spent   on   food,\r\n\r\nclothing,  housing  and other items  change,  with\r\n\r\ngreater  weight being assignable to  more  luxury-type  goods.  We need, therefore,  to  update  the\r\n\r\nweights  used in the construction of our  cost-of-living index. We can rightly demand sacrifices  of\r\n\r\nour  workers in terms of moderating their  demands\r\n\r\nfor  wage  increases but, at the same  time,  they\r\n\r\nmust  not be made to sacrifice some of their  real\r\n\r\nwages   through  inflation,  correctly   measured.\r\n\r\nUltimately,   the  success  or  failure   of   our\r\n\r\ndevelopment efforts depends upon the exertions  of\r\n\r\nour  workers; it goes without saying that they are\r\n\r\nentitled to a fair return.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about the fourth factor\r\n\r\nin  our optimum investment policy. Here I will put\r\n\r\nit as the avoidance of protection measures. I note\r\n\r\nwith alarm the almost casual note inserted by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  at the conclusion of his budget  speech,\r\n\r\nwhere  he  mentioned  that  protection  for   some\r\n\r\nindustries at their early stages of implementation\r\n\r\nmay  be  considered. I hope this will not  be  the\r\n\r\ncase  as  protection  via tariffs  and  quotas  is\r\n\r\ncounter-productive  in the context  of  our  small\r\n\r\neconomy. Let me emphasize once again what  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  on  other occasions, that the real  argument\r\n\r\nfor  protection  is for some kind of  subsidy  for\r\n\r\nlabour  training  or  marketing  or  organisation.\r\n\r\nProtection itself tends to create inefficiency and\r\n\r\nunhealthy dependence on the small domestic market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth factor concerns the quality of our\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  In  the  decade  of  the   Sixties,\r\n\r\nGovernment  did  much  by  way  of  the   economic\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  where,  in  addition  to  physical\r\n\r\nfacilities  for investors, services were  extended\r\n\r\nfrom    new   institutions   like   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Board,  the  Development   Bank   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the Singapore Institute  of  Standards\r\n\r\nand   Industrial  Research,  and  so  on.  In  the\r\n\r\nSeventies,  we  need  careful  evaluation  of  the\r\n\r\neffecttiveness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof these institutions. One or two are,  I\r\n\r\nsuspect,  white  elephants of an  expensive  kind.\r\n\r\nWhile  they  undoubtedly have served a purpose  in\r\n\r\nour  overall investment promotion efforts, we need\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  the  services  promised  to  the\r\n\r\ninvestors materialize effectively. In many  cases,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  need to upgrade the quality  of  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  staff.  As our  economy  grows  more\r\n\r\nsophisticated,  the  kinds  of  manpower  used  in\r\n\r\nmonitoring  and  servicing  industry   must   have\r\n\r\ncorresponding technical expertise. I  would  hope,\r\n\r\ntherefore, that adequate attention will be paid to\r\n\r\nthe  quality of our institutions, from  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice down to the statutory bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth factor is the control of speculative\r\n\r\ncapital.  Part of the blame for the escalation  of\r\n\r\nhousing  costs must be assigned to the  influx  of\r\n\r\nwhat  is  known as `hot' money, that  is,  refugee\r\n\r\ncapital  from  countries suffering  political  and\r\n\r\neconomic  disturbances. Real estate is  a  natural\r\n\r\nhaven  for  such capital. Government  should  look\r\n\r\ninto  the  means  of controlling such  speculative\r\n\r\ncapital  as  otherwise the distortions created  in\r\n\r\nour economy can be very severe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, next I would like to comment on our expenditure on social services. The Budget provides for only a 7.6 per cent increase in this item in the Ordinary Estimates. However, this niggardliness is counter-balanced by a substantial increase in the Development Estimates, giving an\r\n\r\noverall  increase  of over 17  per  cent  for  the\r\n\r\nsocial  sector.  This  perhaps  should  have  been\r\n\r\nbrought out in the Minister's presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, I would think that it is time that\r\n\r\nwe  thought  in  terms of a modern social  welfare\r\n\r\nprogramme incorporating the more positive features\r\n\r\nof such schemes from the advanced countries. Given\r\n\r\nour  present  rate  of economic  development,  our\r\n\r\nGross  Domestic Product will double in five  years\r\n\r\nand  quadruple in 10 years. A more modest rate  of\r\n\r\ngrowth of 10 per\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncent would give us a doubling in seven years and a\r\n\r\nquadrupling  in  14 to 15 years. In  other  words,\r\n\r\nalthough we cannot yet afford the kinds of welfare\r\n\r\nprogramme available in the more advanced countries\r\n\r\nnow,  we shall be able to do so in 10 to 15 years'\r\n\r\ntime  if  we  can keep up our present momentum  of\r\n\r\neconomic  development. For the present, we  should\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on the quality aspect of  our  social\r\n\r\nprojects. However, we should never lose  sight  of\r\n\r\nour socialist goals of equality of opportunity and\r\n\r\na  fair  share for all. Today we rightly emphasize\r\n\r\nthe need for economic efficiency, as reflected  in\r\n\r\nour  slogan: from each his economic best  to  each\r\n\r\nhis  economic worth. The time should come when  we\r\n\r\naccord each person the opportunity for his optimal\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  demand of him not only his  economic\r\n\r\nbut  his  social best as well, and compensate  him\r\n\r\nfor  his  economic and social worth.  Our  present\r\n\r\nconcern  for a clean environment and the call  for\r\n\r\ngracious  living is a harbinger of such things  to\r\n\r\ncome. As we become more affluent, the cultural and\r\n\r\nsocial   aspects   of  life  should   assume   due\r\n\r\nimportance alongside the purely economic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now go on to comment on the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  tourism  in  Singapore.  As   the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  pointed out, earnings from  tourism\r\n\r\nconstitute about 5 per cent of our Gross  Domestic\r\n\r\nProduct. The resources which have been invested in\r\n\r\nthe industry are already considerable if one takes\r\n\r\ninto   account   not  only  hotels   but   airport\r\n\r\nfacilities, night-clubs and public utilities. Even\r\n\r\nmore resources will be devoted, as can he seen  in\r\n\r\nthe   airport  expansion  plans  and  the  Sentosa\r\n\r\ndevelopment project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time we paused to examine two\r\n\r\nimportant questions. The first is an economic one,\r\n\r\nnamely,  what is the optimal degree of development\r\n\r\nof  the tourist industry? In other words, how many\r\n\r\nvisitors  can we optimally accommodate before  the\r\n\r\nadditional  return to our dollar invested  becomes\r\n\r\nnegligible or less than economic? We should  study\r\n\r\ncarefully  countries or states with tourism  as  a\r\n\r\nmajor industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  feel  that  beyond a point, the strain  on  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, in terms of demand for  utilities,\r\n\r\ncommunications  and  transport  becomes  all   too\r\n\r\nevident.  The  costs of providing such  facilities\r\n\r\nwill  undoubtedly rise, which, in addition to  the\r\n\r\nrise  in  the cost of personal services,  means  a\r\n\r\nrise  in  the  cost  of living.  Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\nindustry  is one which is particularly  vulnerable\r\n\r\nto  social  and political disturbances -  visitors\r\n\r\nmay  be  disinclined  to come  here  if  there  is\r\n\r\ntrouble in neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is a cultural one. So far, our\r\n\r\nattitude  seems to be that virtually  anything  is\r\n\r\ntolerable,   provided  it  helps  bring   in   the\r\n\r\ntourists.  On  the one hand, we have  institutions\r\n\r\nwhich frown even on a-go-go types of dancing, and,\r\n\r\non the other, in the name of tourism, we allow the\r\n\r\nimportation  of  the crasser types  of  night-club\r\n\r\nshows  from western countries at great expense.  I\r\n\r\nam  told  that more locals than tourists  frequent\r\n\r\nsuch night-spots. Of more serious concern to us is\r\n\r\nthe  possible cynical reaction of our youth to the\r\n\r\napparent  adoption  of  double-standards  in   our\r\n\r\napproach  to  cultural  matters.  Now,  I  am  not\r\n\r\narguing for a puritanical approach to such things;\r\n\r\nrather, I am appealing for consistent standards to\r\n\r\nbe applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch upon the problem of urban renewal. I am concerned here about two things, one, the uprooting of business and, two, the question of adequate compensation. Many of the small businesses depend on the location and the goodwill built up among the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  clientele.  I  would  expect  severe\r\n\r\neconomic   difficulties   to   arise   when   such\r\n\r\nbusinesses  are  removed elsewhere.  The  solution\r\n\r\nwould  be  to ensure, first of all, that  suitable\r\n\r\nalternative  sites be provided to the satisfaction\r\n\r\nof  the  people concerned, and, secondly, adequate\r\n\r\ncompensation  be  given.  Government  has   argued\r\n\r\nrightly  that  the  subsequent  rise  in  property\r\n\r\nvalues   after  redevelopment  is   due   to   the\r\n\r\ninvestment in roads and communications; however, I\r\n\r\ndo feel that we should err in favour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  people  uprooted  by urban  renewal.  In  many\r\n\r\ncases,  people do not have the means  to  sue  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. In other cases, they probably feel  it\r\n\r\nis  a useless process because, to them, Government\r\n\r\nappears   to  be  all-powerful.  In  the  advanced\r\n\r\ncountries  we  see  the  other  extreme  of  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal projects being held up because of numerous\r\n\r\nlaw  suits brought against the authorities!  While\r\n\r\nthe  going is easy for us, we should try  to  bend\r\n\r\nover  backwards  in accommodating people  who  are\r\n\r\naffected  by our urban renewal schemes, especially\r\n\r\nthe poorer people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to talk about our balance of\r\n\r\npayments.  The Minister for Finance  has  done  an\r\n\r\nadmirable job of analysing the trade deficit.  The\r\n\r\ndeficit is a good and healthy thing because it  is\r\n\r\nstimulated  by  a  buoyant  economy  investing  in\r\n\r\nmachinery  and  plant, which will generate  output\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  the means for repayment  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, for the first time in several years,\r\n\r\nour  growth in Gross Domestic Expenditure  exceeds\r\n\r\nthat of our Gross Domestic Product, reflecting the\r\n\r\nfact   that   investments  exceed   our   savings.\r\n\r\nHitherto,  we  had  saved more  than  we  invested\r\n\r\nlocally,  resulting  in  accretions  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ninvestments  and bank balances abroad.  Investment\r\n\r\nin real terms requires not just a financial inflow\r\n\r\nbut  the  actual importation of the machinery  and\r\n\r\nthe tools required for the production process. The\r\n\r\nordinary layman's view is that balance of payments\r\n\r\nsurpluses  are  good  and  deficits  are  bad;  in\r\n\r\neconomic  terms, surpluses imply the  transfer  of\r\n\r\nreal  goods and services overseas in exchange  for\r\n\r\npaper  claims redeemable at some future  date!  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  a  trade  deficit  would  be  bad  if  it\r\n\r\ncomprises  consumption  type  goods  so  that   no\r\n\r\nproductive capacity is added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to comment on the Minister's reference\r\n\r\nto  Mr  S. Okita's analysis of the causes of  the\r\n\r\nhigh  Japanese growth rates. It seems to  me  that\r\n\r\nthe  nine points listed are more descriptive  than\r\n\r\nanalytical. Sir, two of the points, the  fifth  on\r\n\r\nagriculture  and the ninth, are either  irrelevant\r\n\r\nor unclear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  to the line of causation. In our context,  our\r\n\r\nrapid growth can be attributable to five factors:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Political stability: This is something which\r\n\r\npeople  should not take for granted. In  fact,  we\r\n\r\nshould use the period of relative calm to build  a\r\n\r\nstronger   political  base  to  ensure   continued\r\n\r\nstability  and progress. Investors  have  a  time-horizon  for their calculations and need a  degree\r\n\r\nof  certainty  for their returns,  and  hence  the\r\n\r\nimportance of this factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Economic infrastructure: We are now enjoying\r\n\r\nthe  fruits  of the extensive investments  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic  infrastructure which were  made  in  the\r\n\r\nSixties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Efficient administration: In countries where\r\n\r\nbureaucracy  is  stifling and corruption  rampant,\r\n\r\nmuch  entrepreneurial energy is wasted  in  merely\r\n\r\nsecuring legitimacy. Although we have a relatively\r\n\r\nefficient and non-corrupt civil service, we should\r\n\r\nnot   be  too  complacent.  The  current  courtesy\r\n\r\ncampaign  is a correct step, but we should  remain\r\n\r\nwatchful  against  corruption.  The  more  blatant\r\n\r\nforms  of corruption are easy to detect,  but  the\r\n\r\nmethods  of  corruption can grow in sophistication\r\n\r\ntoo  -  these  are  the more  insidious  and  more\r\n\r\ndifficult to identify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Open-door policy on trade and investment: We\r\n\r\nare  rightly  emphasising export  orientation  and\r\n\r\nproviding   a   hospitable  climate  for   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Labour-force discipline: Last, but not least,\r\n\r\nwe  should  not  forget  the  discipline  and  the\r\n\r\nexertions of our workers. The co-operation of  the\r\n\r\nunions  in  restraining wage demands, in accepting\r\n\r\nlonger work hours, trimming of fringe benefits and\r\n\r\ncurtailment of their bargaining powers, has been a\r\n\r\nmajor positive factor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now let me draw attention to the storm\r\n\r\nsignals which the Minister talked about. The  most\r\n\r\nproximate one concerns the run-down of the British\r\n\r\nmilitary  bases  this  year  of  some  $250-   300\r\n\r\nmillion. While the expenditure effects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper  se  can  be  met  by the counter-recessionary\r\n\r\nmeasures  mentioned by the Minister, I think  that\r\n\r\nin  addition to the efforts of the Bases  Economic\r\n\r\nConversion  Department,  a  more  direct  approach\r\n\r\ntowards  the  absorption of  the  15,000  civilian\r\n\r\nemployees and the 2,000 locally-enlisted personnel\r\n\r\nis necessary. Many of these people, I suspect, are\r\n\r\nin  clerical-type occupations and are  not  young.\r\n\r\nConsequently, they would have great difficulty  in\r\n\r\nfinding   jobs  with  comparable  pay  and   their\r\n\r\nadjustment  problems to new kinds  of  occupations\r\n\r\nare  not inconsequential. I would propose that all\r\n\r\nclerical  and  all  unskilled  job  vacancies   in\r\n\r\nGovernment  and statutory boards in the  next  two\r\n\r\nyears  be  reserved for these retrenched  workers.\r\n\r\nGovernment  bodies should refrain from  taking  in\r\n\r\nyoung  people  for  such occupations  because  the\r\n\r\nyounger people are more adaptable. So let them  go\r\n\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the decline in entrepot earnings\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  the Minister probably reflects  the\r\n\r\nreclassification  of  ship-repairing  services  as\r\n\r\nmanufactures.  However, so long  as  we  can  pull\r\n\r\nahead   in   manufacturing   activity,   decreased\r\n\r\ndependence on entrepot earnings should  induce  no\r\n\r\nundue anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now comment on the silver lining mentioned by the Minister. The hopeful factors raised by the Minister include the role of Japan in influencing the trade and investment in South-east Asian countries. Whether and how Japan will use her vast economic power to\r\n\r\nhelp  South-east  Asia develop is something  which\r\n\r\ndepends  on  her calculations. If she fulfils  her\r\n\r\nsocial   and  economic  responsibilities  to   the\r\n\r\nregion, we stand to benefit substantially  by  way\r\n\r\nof increased trade and investment. Japan currently\r\n\r\nranks  as  our  largest supplier  of  imports  and\r\n\r\nfourth as a market for our exports. The trade  gap\r\n\r\nis  overwhelmingly in her favour. There should  be\r\n\r\nample goodwill on her part, therefore, in allowing\r\n\r\nthe  entry of Singapore manufactures and we should\r\n\r\ntake full advantage of this leverage. In terms  of\r\n\r\ninvestment, we can benefit substantially as  Japan\r\n\r\nmoves on to higher technology industries; however,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  should exercise selectivity and  reject\r\n\r\nthose industries with major pollution problems and\r\n\r\ncultivate  those  which build  up  our  technical,\r\n\r\nmanagerial and marketing skills. In any event,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  forget  that the  Japanese  are  hard\r\n\r\nbargainers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I applaud the decision not to\r\n\r\nraise  new  taxes  as  this  would  be  the  wrong\r\n\r\nstrategy  to pursue when we are trying  to  offset\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure reductions of the British  bases.\r\n\r\nOur  credit  standing is strong, as  the  Minister\r\n\r\nrightly  pointed  out. If past experience  is  any\r\n\r\nguide,  I  suspect also that some of the estimated\r\n\r\ntax revenues are under-estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget, however, that this is not yet\r\n\r\nthe  time  to relax. We should remain watchful  to\r\n\r\nsee  how our workers imbibe the new skills and how\r\n\r\nour  managers  and executives learn the  ropes  of\r\n\r\nmodern organisation and sales techniques. The more\r\n\r\ndifficult phase of development lies ahead  because\r\n\r\nquality   is   more  difficult  to  achieve   than\r\n\r\nquantity.  Our  concern in the  years  ahead  must\r\n\r\nincreasingly  be  with  quality  of   skills,   of\r\n\r\nproducts,  of  management, of  institutions,  and,\r\n\r\nabove all, of the political leadership. At a  time\r\n\r\nof  relative  peace and prosperity, the  political\r\n\r\nchallenge  is  not  so  much  of  courage  hut  of\r\n\r\nforesight in anticipating problems and of  patient\r\n\r\ntoil in the construction of an even better future.\r\n\r\nIn such a setting, the temptation unfortunately is\r\n\r\nalways to relax and grow flabby with age and over-indulgence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, the total expenditure  of  the\r\n\r\nbudget for the financial year 1st April, 1971,  to\r\n\r\n31st   March,   1972,   is  $1,308,000,000.

In  spite  of\r\n\r\nthis, there are neither new taxes nor any increase\r\n\r\nin  the existing rates of taxation. All this shows\r\n\r\nthat,  as  a  result  of the co-operation  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, we have been able to  depend\r\n\r\non ourselves to grow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  economically  and socially. It  is  worth  our\r\n\r\nwhile  to  exert  ourselves  to  achieve  economic\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Finance Minister's budget statement, the\r\n\r\nGross  Domestic  Product of  1970  has  increased,\r\n\r\nrepresenting a growth of 15 per cent.  This  is  a\r\n\r\ngreat leap forward in our economic growth. But the\r\n\r\nincrease in taxi fares, in the prices of sugar and\r\n\r\nbread will also mean a rise in the cost of living.\r\n\r\nI do not know why in recent months the prices of a\r\n\r\nwhole  range of commodities have increased.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult of these price increases, the common people\r\n\r\nare   very   worried.  In  developing   countries,\r\n\r\nindustrial  progress entails an  increase  in  the\r\n\r\ncost of living. This is almost inevitable. But the\r\n\r\nsudden  spate of price increases, resulting  in  a\r\n\r\nrise  in  the  cost  of  living  overnight,  means\r\n\r\nimposing  a great burden on the common people.  If\r\n\r\nthere is no check on this inflation, it will  lead\r\n\r\nto  social discontent and grave anxiety among  the\r\n\r\nmasses.  As a result, many people will have  cause\r\n\r\nto worry about their future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister concerned to take\r\n\r\nimmediate steps to set up a commission of  inquiry\r\n\r\nto  look  into the unscrupulous behaviour  of  the\r\n\r\nmerchants and traders at large. We should be  able\r\n\r\nto  bring  down the cost of living to  its  normal\r\n\r\nlevel.  There should be no more squeezing  by  the\r\n\r\nunscrupulous businessmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the Government is paying attention to the rising cost of housing. Perhaps action will be taken to halt the increase in the cost of building because it will affect our economic development. This is a very wise declaration of policy. But the increase in the\r\n\r\nprices  of  land  and commodities should  also  be\r\n\r\nchecked.  At a time when the Government  is  going\r\n\r\nahead  with its urban renewal scheme, the building\r\n\r\ntrade   is   having   an   all-time   boom.   Many\r\n\r\nmanufacturers of building materials have cashed in\r\n\r\non  the  situation.  But has the  Government  done\r\n\r\nanything to stop it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government announces every week in the\r\n\r\nGovernment Gazette the acquisition of lots of land\r\n\r\nin various areas. This could perhaps be one of the\r\n\r\nfactors  contributing to the rise in the  cost  of\r\n\r\nland.  Because  of this Government acquisition  of\r\n\r\nland, there has been a lot of land speculation. In\r\n\r\nthe course of speculation, the prices of land have\r\n\r\nbeen deliberately increased. This has caused great\r\n\r\nhardship  to the poor and middle-class people  who\r\n\r\nhave  to  look  to  Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nflats for their housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing the Home Ownership Scheme, we\r\n\r\nwant  to  ensure that as many families as possible\r\n\r\nown  their  own houses and flats. This  policy  is\r\n\r\nwelcomed  by  the poorer people of Singapore.  But\r\n\r\nthe  price  of the flats in the Kallang  area  has\r\n\r\nbeen raised. This is a matter which we should  not\r\n\r\ntake  lightly. The reason given is that such flats\r\n\r\nare  in the city area, so the prices tend to be  a\r\n\r\nbit high, but the Housing and Development Board is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to be a servicing institution  to  build\r\n\r\nhousing  for the people, particularly  the  poorer\r\n\r\npeople. So we should not pursue the same policy as\r\n\r\nprivate developers do, and that is to make  money.\r\n\r\nThere  is nothing objectionable if the high  price\r\n\r\nis  due to the cost of building materials, but  if\r\n\r\nthe reason is that the area has been developed  or\r\n\r\nis  nearer the city, it is open to question. Using\r\n\r\nthe  same  argument, the prices of all  the  other\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development Board flats should  have\r\n\r\nbeen  raised because factories would be  built  in\r\n\r\nthese areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people registered for Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board accommodation many years  before\r\n\r\nthe  flats  were ready for occupation. But  during\r\n\r\nthe  period of waiting, there has been an increase\r\n\r\nin  property values. Can this be used as an excuse\r\n\r\nto  raise  the  price of flats  subsequently?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  would like to  quote  a  letter\r\n\r\nwritten by a so-called efficient public servant. I\r\n\r\nwill quote in English:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Representation to Mr...., M.P. for ...Constituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are hereby requested to pay up the sum of\r\n\r\n$251  within two weeks of the date of this  letter\r\n\r\nas  payment  for 1970 and 1971 licence fees.  This\r\n\r\noffer of licence will be withdrawn if you fail  to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours faithfully, signed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In Mandarin)</i> Mr Speaker, Sir, the tone of this\r\n\r\nletter more or less amounts to a threat and is  an\r\n\r\ninsult  to the Member of Parliament concerned.  In\r\n\r\nother words, it amounts to this - \"You can go  and\r\n\r\nsee  your M.P., but I warn you that if you do  not\r\n\r\npay  within  two  weeks,  your  licence  will   be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.\" There are some civil servants who know\r\n\r\nthat  the requests of members of the public cannot\r\n\r\nbe  met,  but they deliberately tell them  to  see\r\n\r\ntheir  M.P.s, knowing full well that such requests\r\n\r\ncannot be met. In this way they are trying  to  be\r\n\r\ndifficult with the M.P.s, and create discontent or\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding between the Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nand the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the few points that I wish to bring to\r\n\r\nthe attention of the Minister in charge. It is  my\r\n\r\nhope  that proper attention will be given  to  all\r\n\r\nthese grievances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I am happy that there have been no\r\n\r\ntax  increases in the new budget. I am also  happy\r\n\r\nwith  the  economic growth which the Minister  has\r\n\r\nreported in his budget statement. I support him in\r\n\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  all the people in  Singapore  were\r\n\r\ngreatly  relieved after they had listened  to  the\r\n\r\nspeech made by the Minister for Finance on the 8th\r\n\r\nof  March  in this House. The reason is  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  was not going to introduce new taxes  or\r\n\r\nincrease the existing tax rates. From the people's\r\n\r\npoint of view, naturally they hope that each  year\r\n\r\nthe  budget  will  be balanced without  having  to\r\n\r\nintroduce new taxes, otherwise they will  have  to\r\n\r\ntighten their belts no end. In recent months  -  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Minister is also aware of this  -prices\r\n\r\nof  commodities have risen tremendously.  Although\r\n\r\nthe  price increases are often disguised  by  such\r\n\r\nterms as \"price adjustments\", \"price standardisation\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  \"price unification\", the  people  know\r\n\r\nthat  it amounts to a rise in many of their  daily\r\n\r\nconsumer goods: coffee, sugar and bread; even  bus\r\n\r\nfares are on the increase! It is only the wages of\r\n\r\nworkers   that  have  not  shown  a  corresponding\r\n\r\nincrease.  We are in a situation where  wages  are\r\n\r\nforever  lagging behind prices. It  is  no  wonder\r\n\r\nthat  the people are distressed that the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  is  increasing every day.  Their  life  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  more and more difficult. I think  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  necessary for me to remind the Minister  that\r\n\r\nP.A.P, is  supposed  to  be  a  socialist  party.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Government and the  party  should\r\n\r\nhave the welfare of the lower income group more at\r\n\r\nheart,  and  prevent the income  gap  between  the\r\n\r\nhaves and the have-nots from becoming wider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is also one of the originators of our industrialisation plans. Today, industries are playing an important role in the economic growth of our country. In Other words, the structure of our economy has been transformed from that of an entrepot trading port to an industrial economy. We\r\n\r\ncan  say that the Government has looked after  the\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   programme   very   well.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the Economic Development Board  provides\r\n\r\nlocal  and  foreign investors with  assistance  in\r\n\r\ntheir  plans. The Jurong Town Corporation provides\r\n\r\nprospective investors with suitable factory sites.\r\n\r\nThe  Development Bank provides the necessary loans\r\n\r\nor     any     financial    assistance.    INTRACO\r\n\r\n(International  Trading  Company)   provides   new\r\n\r\nmarkets overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if we look at the agricultural\r\n\r\nsector,  we  can see that the Government  has  not\r\n\r\ndone  enough.  In  the Finance Minister's  speech,\r\n\r\nthere is very little mention of it. The most  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has done is the establishment  of\r\n\r\nthe   Primary  Production  Department   which   is\r\n\r\nsupposed   to  provide  technical  assistance   to\r\n\r\nfarmers.    However,   whether   this    technical\r\n\r\nassistance  is  efficiently  transmitted  to   the\r\n\r\nfarmers  is  rather  open to  doubt.  The  farming\r\n\r\noperations in our country are becoming smaller and\r\n\r\nsmaller. The number\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof people who are engaged in farming is  also\r\n\r\non  the decrease. If we do not take steps to  stop\r\n\r\nthis  trend,  we might find that we will  have  to\r\n\r\nspend   something  like  $200  million   for   our\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  agricultural products.  We  have\r\n\r\nnearly 200,000 farmers and their families who work\r\n\r\nall  day long and who earn just sufficient to keep\r\n\r\nthem  going. If their crop is a failure or if  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  their products fall,  they  will  lose\r\n\r\ntheir  capital  outlay.  If  they  wish  to  start\r\n\r\nafresh, they have to borrow money at high interest\r\n\r\nrates  from  middlemen  or  from  tontines.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  they are forever in debt. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas  not  provided adequate assistance to them.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it should set up a farmers' bank to provide\r\n\r\nlow-interest  loans to them. With such  assistance\r\n\r\nthey   will  be  able  to  purchase  new   farming\r\n\r\nequipment   and   so  maintain  or   raise   their\r\n\r\nproduction  level. This assistance  is  especially\r\n\r\nneeded  because  we are trying to  develop  small-scale  concentrated  farming activities.  We  also\r\n\r\nhave to look after their production facilities  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  hygiene. All this will cost money,  and\r\n\r\nthe Government should, therefore, help them at all\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government assistance should not be limited only\r\n\r\nto  times  of disaster. We know the Government  is\r\n\r\naware of the exploitation of farmers by middlemen.\r\n\r\nThe prices of agricultural products are subject to\r\n\r\nviolent  fluctuations, but the Government has  not\r\n\r\ndone anything to control this. Nor has it set up a\r\n\r\nco-operative  scheme for the  farmers,  or  helped\r\n\r\nthem  to  find new markets overseas. As a  result,\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  go  on  their own.  Naturally  the\r\n\r\nresults are not encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point. The Government is\r\n\r\nspending a large sum of money each year to collect\r\n\r\nstatistics of agricultural activity for  research.\r\n\r\nBut  the findings have not been made available  to\r\n\r\nthe  farmers. We have been told that research  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made on intensive farming schemes, but there\r\n\r\nis  no  evidence  of  an  implementation  of  such\r\n\r\nintensive farming techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the problem of land. We know that\r\n\r\nland  is a scarce commodity and yet much of it  is\r\n\r\nbeing    used    for   military   purposes,    for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, and for urbanisation. The  land\r\n\r\navailable for farming is becoming less and less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must also take a look at the fishing\r\n\r\nindustry. In 1967 our fishermen caught 17,921 tons\r\n\r\nof  fish.  In 1969 it dropped to 12,100 tons.  The\r\n\r\nnumber of fishermen has also dropped tremendously,\r\n\r\nand  we  cannot blind ourselves to this tact.  The\r\n\r\nreport of the Primary Production Department  shows\r\n\r\nthat  in  1968 there were 3,861 fishermen, whereas\r\n\r\nin 1969 there were only 1,314. The kelong industry\r\n\r\nhas  also declined, because the fish available  in\r\n\r\nthe  off-shore  areas is limited.  The  fishermen,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  have  to go far out to  sea  to  fish,\r\n\r\nthereby  running great risks. But  they  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  offered any protection from the  dangers  of\r\n\r\nthe  high  seas. Should they lose their  bearings,\r\n\r\nthey  might  be  blown off-course and  land  in  a\r\n\r\nforeign  country  where they may be  subjected  to\r\n\r\nhumiliation. If they do come back alive, they  can\r\n\r\ncount themselves lucky. The Government should come\r\n\r\nto  some sort of agreement on fishing rights  with\r\n\r\nour   neighbouring  countries,  and   to   provide\r\n\r\nadequate  protection  for our  fishermen  who  are\r\n\r\nengaged  in  deep-sea fishing. But  if  Government\r\n\r\nintends   to  promote  deep-sea  fishing   without\r\n\r\nproviding this protection, then nothing  much  can\r\n\r\nbe achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I do not understand why the pioneer\r\n\r\nindustry  status  for deep-sea  fishing  has  been\r\n\r\nwithdrawn.  How can we encourage our investors  to\r\n\r\ninvest  their  money in deep-sea  fishing  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is doing all this? It should  adopt  a\r\n\r\npositive attitude towards deep-sea fishing and not\r\n\r\nindulge in empty talk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Government has not set\r\n\r\naside  a  piece of land for a fishing  village  to\r\n\r\naccommodate    those   fishermen    affected    by\r\n\r\nresettlement schemes. This is because they are not\r\n\r\nclassified  as  farmers,  and  are  therefore  not\r\n\r\nentitled to a piece of land. As a result,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  can only be settled in Housing Board  flats.\r\n\r\nBut  most  of these flats are at a great  distance\r\n\r\nfrom  where they keep their fishing boats. Because\r\n\r\nof  this, many of them are forced to change  their\r\n\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although we cannot rely entirely on agriculture and fishing alone as we must also look after other industries, we must, however, not neglect these two industries because a large number of our people are engaged in them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  this is the second consecutive year in which\r\n\r\na painless budget has been presented to this House\r\n\r\nand  to  the people of Singapore. May I take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to congratulate the Government and the\r\n\r\nMinister  on  the apparently happy  state  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic's financial affairs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in his budget statement, the Minister\r\n\r\nintroduced a cautionary note by drawing  attention\r\n\r\nto  the  ominous  presence of  indicative  factors\r\n\r\nmaking  for economic instability. The vagaries  of\r\n\r\nthe  International Monetary System and the British\r\n\r\nwithdrawal, for instance, are apparently  pointers\r\n\r\nto  the  vulnerability of the  foundation  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic   viability  and  prosperity.   Sir,   we\r\n\r\nSingaporeans pride ourselves on our realistic  and\r\n\r\npragmatic   attitude  to  life.  The  history   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  particularly during the  past  decade,\r\n\r\nconfirms   rather   than   refutes   Singaporeans'\r\n\r\nawareness of and their capacity to cope  with  the\r\n\r\nups and downs of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is not my intention to suggest that a\r\n\r\ncautionary  note is out of tune in a budget  meant\r\n\r\nto instil confidence, it would have been better if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  had  run through  the  whole  gamut\r\n\r\nrather than just a solitary note of caution. I may\r\n\r\nbe  wrong but the impression I receive is that the\r\n\r\nMinister, after delivering himself of the note  of\r\n\r\ncaution,  merely contented himself with  a  \"happy\r\n\r\nbudget\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, the Minister has over-emphasised the impact of the British Conservative\r\n\r\nGovernment's  decision  to  maintain  a   military\r\n\r\npresence  in  the  area on British  investment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  No  doubt, British industrialists  and\r\n\r\nbusinessmen may get a moral boost from being under\r\n\r\nthe very faint shadow of British arms in this area\r\n\r\neven  after  1971.  But all the same,  hard-headed\r\n\r\ninvestors, whether British or otherwise, look  for\r\n\r\nsomething more substantial and tangible  than  the\r\n\r\nghost  of gunboat diplomacy. For British investors\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, the recent statutory  assurance  of\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Government  to  guarantee   their\r\n\r\ninvestment is more likely to appeal to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that there are other important\r\n\r\nreasons beside those mentioned by the Minister for\r\n\r\nthe  present economic well-being of Singapore. The\r\n\r\npolitical stability of Singapore and its potential\r\n\r\nfor profitable economic investment undoubtedly are\r\n\r\ncontributive  factors  of  our  present   economic\r\n\r\nhealth.  My great regret is that our hard-working,\r\n\r\nadaptable  and responsible workers, who constitute\r\n\r\nthe  back-up  troops  as well  as  the  front-line\r\n\r\nfighters in our drive towards economic success, do\r\n\r\nnot   merit  even  perfunctory  praise  from   the\r\n\r\nMinister. The acceptance of the Employment Act  by\r\n\r\nthe  trade union movement against the grain of its\r\n\r\ntraditional  objective  is  in  keeping  with  the\r\n\r\navowed  policy of co-operation with the Government\r\n\r\nin any matter of national interest. The Government\r\n\r\nhas   acknowledged  this  in  private,  but  after\r\n\r\nlistening to the Minister's speech, I was saddened\r\n\r\nnot  to hear a word of tribute to the contribution\r\n\r\nby labour towards the prosperity of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The. Minister spoke confidently of \"a record\r\n\r\nnumber   of  very  large  projects  by  well-known\r\n\r\ninternational    companies\"    extending     their\r\n\r\noperations to Singapore in 1971. I have  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat  this desirable trend will contribute towards\r\n\r\nthe  continuing economic growth.  But  I  have  my\r\n\r\nmisgivings about the undesirable side-effects that\r\n\r\nmay  be generated by such large-scale invasion  of\r\n\r\nforeign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestment. Labour may be plentiful in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut    trained    and   skilled    manpower    is,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, not plentiful. The result  is  that\r\n\r\nharassed  employers are prepared to up their  ante\r\n\r\nto secure their supply of such scarce manpower. As\r\n\r\nmore   and   more  foreign  industries   come   to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  lose more and more  trained  civil\r\n\r\nservants to the private sector which pays more for\r\n\r\ntheir  services. My fear is that if we  allow  the\r\n\r\nhaemorrhage  of trained personnel from  our  civil\r\n\r\nservice  to continue unchecked, not only will  our\r\n\r\ncivil  service be unable to claim to be  the  most\r\n\r\nefficient in South-east Asia, as it can today, but\r\n\r\nalso  our  socio-economic  infrastructure  may  be\r\n\r\nweakened  to  that  extent. We do  not  match  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  in  payment of  wages  and  other\r\n\r\nfringe benefits, because we just cannot afford  to\r\n\r\nmatch them. As a result, the cream of our citizens\r\n\r\nare  not  attracted  to  a  career  in  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice.  Even  among serving civil servants,  the\r\n\r\ntemptation to leave is ever present. Those  senior\r\n\r\ncivil servants who remain in service do so because\r\n\r\nof  their loyalty to the national cause and  their\r\n\r\ndedication to the civil service. The bright  young\r\n\r\nones  will stay on to gain some experience  before\r\n\r\njoining  the private sector where they expect  the\r\n\r\npasture to be undoubtedly greener. The trouble  is\r\n\r\nthat  very few in the private sector see a greener\r\n\r\npasture in the civil service. The question is, can\r\n\r\nwe afford to allow such a situation to continue to\r\n\r\ndeteriorate? At the moment, we are exploiting  the\r\n\r\nfew  dedicated arid loyal civil servants by making\r\n\r\nthem  do not just one full-time job but in certain\r\n\r\ncases even three or four full-time jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have known of many experienced civil servants\r\n\r\nwho  would  not be so dedicated to and would  have\r\n\r\nleft  the service today to join private industries\r\n\r\nwhich   are  crying  for  seasoned  and  competent\r\n\r\nmanagerial  personnel, were it not  for  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat they stand to lose their pension rights.  The\r\n\r\nsituation would have been different if such  civil\r\n\r\nservants   had  been  governed  by   the   Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund Ordinance rather than the  Pensions\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  For the civil service  to  retain  its\r\n\r\ntrained and experienced\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersonnel  in  the  face of  blatant  poaching  by\r\n\r\nprivate  employers, the terms  and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice and working conditions obtainable  in  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  have to be revised and  made  more\r\n\r\nattractive.  It is all very well to  say  that  we\r\n\r\nwant  only  civil  servants who are  dedicated  to\r\n\r\npublic  service  and that for such civil  servants\r\n\r\nmoney  is of immaterial consideration. While there\r\n\r\nare  undoubtedly civil servants who fit this bill,\r\n\r\nthe   vast   majority  are  only  human   or   too\r\n\r\nsusceptible.  Dedication  and  loyalty  to  public\r\n\r\ninterest  and national interest are two  qualities\r\n\r\nwhich cannot appear to have carried much weight in\r\n\r\nthe  light  of  our  obvious  admiration  for  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneur who can make a fast buck.  My  point,\r\n\r\nhowever,   is   that  even  the   most   energetic\r\n\r\nentrepreneur can constructively pursue his  money-making activities best in an economy with a stable\r\n\r\nsocio-economic infrastructure, of which the  civil\r\n\r\nservice must provide the vital skeletal framework.\r\n\r\nI  should not think a painful budget is too high a\r\n\r\nprice to pay for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that the time is ripe for a\r\n\r\ncomplete  overhaul of our civil service terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of service so as to be able  to  arrest\r\n\r\nthe  continuing stream of resignations from  among\r\n\r\nthe  middle  and lower echelons of  teachers,  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force, the Fire Brigade and other branches\r\n\r\nof  our  civil service. Not only are such  trained\r\n\r\ncivil  servants hard to replace at once, but every\r\n\r\nloss of trained personnel also means that there is\r\n\r\na wastage of public funds. I know that a committee\r\n\r\nhas  been  set up to look into the wage scales  in\r\n\r\nour  police force and that the Teachers' Union has\r\n\r\nhad  one  discussion, as was pointed  out  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Moulmein yesterday, With the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Education  some  six  months  ago.  But   the\r\n\r\ndiscontentment   among  civil  servants   is   not\r\n\r\nconfined to the teachers and policemen alone. I do\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister will look thoroughly into  the\r\n\r\nmatter  and  not  dismiss it with another  cursory\r\n\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has mentioned that there has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  boom  in the building industry.  He  has,\r\n\r\nhowever,   added   that  the  \"smaller   increases\r\n\r\nrecorded  for  these  building materials  indicate\r\n\r\nthat  the  construction  industry's  36  per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease in earnings may be constituted partly  by\r\n\r\nhigher profit margins and only partly by increased\r\n\r\nconstructional capacity.\" Sir, this statement  has\r\n\r\nborne  out my belief that the shortage of  skilled\r\n\r\nbuilding   and   construction  workers   and   the\r\n\r\nconsequent higher wage level of such workers  have\r\n\r\nnot been responsible for the fantastic prices that\r\n\r\nthe  developers  charge for their products  during\r\n\r\nthe  past  few years. While I am pleased  to  note\r\n\r\nthat the Minister has acknowledged the cupidity of\r\n\r\ndevelopers as the cause of the rocketing prices of\r\n\r\nlanded  property and am assured that he is keeping\r\n\r\nhis Ministerial eye on the situation, I would have\r\n\r\nbeen  happier if the Minister had intimated a more\r\n\r\nconcrete  course of action against the anti-social\r\n\r\nconduct  of  our developers. Sir, if  he  were  to\r\n\r\nintimidate  the  developers, I would  be  happier!\r\n\r\nUnless  the Government steps in and does something\r\n\r\ndrastic now, the ever-spiralling circle of  prices\r\n\r\nextorted  by the building developers will  put  it\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  dreams, and means  of  ordinary  wage\r\n\r\nearners  to  own their homes. Sir, the  developers\r\n\r\nwho  sold  small houses at $20,000 each two  years\r\n\r\nago are now demanding anything between $50,000 and\r\n\r\n$60,000 for similar houses in the same estates. It\r\n\r\nis  cheaper  in Jurong, I am told! The trouble  is\r\n\r\nthat   the   wage   level  has  not  significantly\r\n\r\nincreased  during the past decade.  While  a  wage\r\n\r\nearner earning about $1,000 per month three  years\r\n\r\nago  was  in  a position to purchase a reasonable-sized  house  from  a private  developer,  now  he\r\n\r\ncannot even own a smaller house. His best hope for\r\n\r\na  home  of his own is to turn to the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  which  is  subsidised  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This, however, places a great  strain\r\n\r\non  the  resources of the Housing and  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  which  cannot  meet such  increased  demand\r\n\r\nwithout  neglecting the needs of workers who  earn\r\n\r\nconsiderably less than $l,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nper  month  and  who constitute the  bulk  of  the\r\n\r\nworking  population. Thus, the  so-called  middle-class workers are caught between the devil of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopers  and the deep blue sea of  the  limited\r\n\r\nresources of the Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rising prices of houses is a serious problem\r\n\r\ntoday  and,  instead of continuing  to  watch  the\r\n\r\nsituation  further, I think the Government  should\r\n\r\ntake  action  now to prevent this  condition  from\r\n\r\ndeteriorating any further. With the present prices\r\n\r\nof  houses,  even the Housing Loan Scheme  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  with  its maximum of $40,000,  or  the\r\n\r\nequivalent  of three years' salary,  whichever  is\r\n\r\nlower,  becomes more of a mockery than an  aid  to\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  who  aspire to  be  proud  house-owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While workers have responded to the call of the\r\n\r\nGovernment to stabilize the wage level, developers\r\n\r\ncapitalise   on  the  apparent  neglect   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  the deleterious effects  of  price\r\n\r\nmanipulations by developers. It appears to be  the\r\n\r\nthinking  of the Government that, as long  as  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board can control sufficient\r\n\r\nland  for  the construction and use of  factories,\r\n\r\nand  the  Housing and Development Board  can  have\r\n\r\nsufficient  land  for housing factory  workers  as\r\n\r\ncheaply as possible, private developers are to  be\r\n\r\npermitted to enjoy laissez faire. Thus our middle-class  workers are made to compete at a very great\r\n\r\ndisadvantage  with expatriate or foreign  managers\r\n\r\nand  technicians  who, with the backing  of  their\r\n\r\nrespective  employers, are able  and  prepared  to\r\n\r\nplay along with the developers' game of jacking-up\r\n\r\nhousing  costs  beyond the reach of local  buyers.\r\n\r\nThe  supreme irony of this all is that the capital\r\n\r\ngains  so engendered by private developers  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  syphoned off by the Government in the form  of\r\n\r\ntaxes to increase, for instance, the resources  of\r\n\r\nthe Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, tourism represents a source of further\r\n\r\neconomic growth. The Government should ensure that\r\n\r\nsuch a source is not unduly prejudiced. There is a\r\n\r\nneed  for  action to be taken to prevent the  many\r\n\r\ntourists from being fleeced by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  shops which are only interested in making  a\r\n\r\nfast  buck and being misled by touts operating  as\r\n\r\ntourist  guides. Sir,. I am aware that  there  are\r\n\r\nmany  genuine and competent tourist guides, but  I\r\n\r\nam  also aware that there are as many touts posing\r\n\r\nas   bona  fide  tourist  guides.  Sir,  for  many\r\n\r\ntourists Singapore is a byword as an international\r\n\r\nshopping  centre  for  popular  items,   such   as\r\n\r\ncameras,   watches,  transistors,  ornaments   and\r\n\r\ncurios.  I  appreciate that ours is a  free  trade\r\n\r\neconomy, but if it is possible we should institute\r\n\r\nsome  form of control of prices of goods  normally\r\n\r\npurchased by tourists. Touts operating as  tourist\r\n\r\nguides  take  the unsuspecting tourists  to  shops\r\n\r\nthat charge exorbitant prices, and the shops pay a\r\n\r\ncommission  to  such  touts.  While  the   Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board  has directed  its  attention  to\r\n\r\nundesirable practices among shopkeepers, it should\r\n\r\nexercise  greater vigilance in the protection  and\r\n\r\npromotion   of   Singapore's  reputation   as   an\r\n\r\ninternational shopping centre. Sir, I even  notice\r\n\r\na   shop   in   Stamford  Road  with  a  signboard\r\n\r\nproclaiming  itself to be a tax-free shop,  giving\r\n\r\nthe impression that goods purchased in other shops\r\n\r\ncarry purchase tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister claims that the price index has\r\n\r\nrisen  by  only 11.5 per cent since  1960.  A  few\r\n\r\nMembers  have taken up this question. This  figure\r\n\r\nis  taken  from  the Monthly Digest of  Statistics\r\n\r\nproduced  by the Department of Statistics.  May  I\r\n\r\nhumbly  suggest that even the Minister's wife,  if\r\n\r\nshe   does  marketing  herself,  would  vehemently\r\n\r\ndisagree  with him. Statistics show only what  the\r\n\r\nstatistician  wants to show. The  presentation  of\r\n\r\nstatistics can be an exact science but it can also\r\n\r\nbe  a  very  refined art. While the cost-of-living\r\n\r\nindex  purports  to show the average  increase  in\r\n\r\nprices of commodities of general consumption,  the\r\n\r\nweights   given  to  the  respective   items   can\r\n\r\ninfluence the final figure, that is, the  cost-of-living  index. For it must be remembered  that  of\r\n\r\nall  the items used for computation of the  index,\r\n\r\nnot  all  the  items are of equal  importance.  In\r\n\r\ncomputing an accurate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindex,  more  weights have to be  given  to  items\r\n\r\nwhich  are  consumed  in  greater  quantities.  By\r\n\r\nplaying about with statistical weights, the  index\r\n\r\ncan  be rigged to show an increase or decrease  in\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of  living. Let me  illustrate  with  a\r\n\r\npractical  example, the prices of which have  been\r\n\r\ntaken  from  the  Government's Monthly  Digest  of\r\n\r\nStatistics. If we are to compute on an index  with\r\n\r\ndisproportionately  greater  weights  assigned  to\r\n\r\nitems  (on  the  basis of the data  shown  in  the\r\n\r\nMonthly Digest of Statistics) such as fish,  which\r\n\r\nhas  increased in price by 29 per cent since 1960,\r\n\r\nsugar  products by 62 per cent, vegetables  by  20\r\n\r\nper  cent, beverages by 18 per cent, furniture and\r\n\r\nhousehold equipment by 36 per cent and footwear by\r\n\r\n16  per  cent, the cost of living can be shown  to\r\n\r\nhave  increased by more than double  the  official\r\n\r\n11.5  per cent quoted by the Minister since  1960.\r\n\r\nConversely,      by     arbitrarily      assigning\r\n\r\ndisproportionately greater weights to  such  items\r\n\r\nas  meat and poultry which have gone down in price\r\n\r\nby  three per cent since 1960, oils and fats which\r\n\r\nhave gone up by one per cent, fruits up by two per\r\n\r\ncent,  tailoring and laundering charges up by  one\r\n\r\nper  cent,  transport  up  by  one  per  cent  and\r\n\r\nentertainment  up by four per cent,  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving can be shown to increase by only less  than\r\n\r\nhalf the official figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that a publication of the cost-of-living index cannot be treated in the same manner\r\n\r\nas  the  reading of a thermometer can be taken  to\r\n\r\nmeasure a rise or a fall in temperature. I am not,\r\n\r\nhowever,  imputing  any  sinister  motive  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  who  has shown such great faith  in  the\r\n\r\nofficial  cost-of-living index,  or  any  lack  of\r\n\r\nintegrity   to   those  civil  servants   in   the\r\n\r\nStatistics   Department   responsible   for    the\r\n\r\npublication of the official index.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to make is that the cost of\r\n\r\nliving  is  closely  related to  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving. Any improvement in the standard of  living\r\n\r\nwill  radically affect the pattern of weights used\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomputing the cost-of-living index. As the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Whampoa has pointed out just now, the pattern\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  changed in the  computation  since\r\n\r\n1960. In the meantime, the standard of living  has\r\n\r\nimproved beyond recognition, judging by the number\r\n\r\nof  cars, scooters, television sets and what-have-you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the cost of living remains a matter for\r\n\r\nspeculation,  profiteers can continue  to  thrive.\r\n\r\nThe  latest price hike is in respect of  bread.  1\r\n\r\nwas  shocked to read recently of the threat by the\r\n\r\nBakers' Association against bakers who may wish to\r\n\r\nsell  their bread below the price dictated by  the\r\n\r\nAssociation. The increased price of bread could be\r\n\r\nunderstandable if the production costs  have  gone\r\n\r\nup  as  a result of the increased costs of  flour,\r\n\r\nlabour, etc. Here, we have an Association ordering\r\n\r\nits   members   to  increase  the  price   without\r\n\r\njustification and threatening them with  reprisals\r\n\r\nif  they  refuse to join in fleecing  the  hapless\r\n\r\nconsumers.  I  would have thought  the  Government\r\n\r\nshould  have  smacked  this Association  down  and\r\n\r\nhard. What is more ominous is the thought that the\r\n\r\nAssociation  would not be able to  make  good  its\r\n\r\nthreat of reprisals against public-spirited bakers\r\n\r\nunless  they  have the backing of flour  producers\r\n\r\nand    distributors.   The   increase   in   bread\r\n\r\nconsumption in the republic is a testimony to  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of  the  Government's  campaign  to\r\n\r\npersuade  Singaporeans to  eat  wheat  instead  of\r\n\r\nrice.  The least the Government can do now  is  to\r\n\r\nprevent a handful of local wheat and bread tycoons\r\n\r\nfrom holding the rest of us to ransom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of being accused of wallowing in self-pity, I have to round up my comments on the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance's speech with the observation\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  a  tough  job  being  a  worker   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. As the bulk of consumers, workers  find\r\n\r\nthemselves  not  only at the  losing  end  of  the\r\n\r\nbattle against rising prices, but also tilting  at\r\n\r\nsome  quixotic windmills into the bargain, because\r\n\r\nthe cost of living has officially increased by not\r\n\r\nmore than one per cent per year since 1960. As the\r\n\r\nprincipal source of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlabour,  workers find that national  interest  has\r\n\r\nnot,  and  is  not  expected to have,  any  cogent\r\n\r\nappeal for owners and developers of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As trade unionists, workers are constantly\r\n\r\nexhorted to be realistic and practical in  worldly\r\n\r\naffairs  and,  towards  this  end,  are  urged  to\r\n\r\nfamiliarise  themselves with the various  concepts\r\n\r\nand  analyses  of  society. Thus,  the  Government\r\n\r\nhails the decision of the trade union movement  to\r\n\r\nreorganise  itself and to reorientate and  educate\r\n\r\nits  officials  and members so as to  be  able  to\r\n\r\nassist  in  the  development  of  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nMinister himself stated the other day that we  can\r\n\r\nmake Singapore the key location for industries  if\r\n\r\n\"our  workers and the unions are educated  to  the\r\n\r\nrealities of our economic life, keen to make their\r\n\r\ncontribution to the transformation of our  society\r\n\r\nwith high industrialisation and sophistication  in\r\n\r\ntechnology\". But, unfortunately, the vast majority\r\n\r\nof employers do not seem to view national interest\r\n\r\nor the urgency of national development in the same\r\n\r\nlight  as  the  Minister and the workers,  if  the\r\n\r\nworkers wish to attend enlightening courses,  they\r\n\r\ncan  do  so  in  their own time and  make  further\r\n\r\nsacrifices  in  the national interest.  And  those\r\n\r\nsame  employers are the ones who benefit most from\r\n\r\nthe painless budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin(Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\ncoming  amidst  complaints of the rising  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving, the painless budget is indeed most welcome\r\n\r\nand  public  jubilation is very much in  evidence.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the Minister's speech he has,\r\n\r\namong  other things, made mention of the continued\r\n\r\ninflationary  conditions  in  some  of  the  major\r\n\r\nindustrial   countries.  He  has  also   expressed\r\n\r\nconcern  over  the cost increase in  the  building\r\n\r\nindustry  and  has  promised to maintain  a  close\r\n\r\nwatch  upon the situation. However, touching  upon\r\n\r\nthe  question of the cost of living, I am inclined\r\n\r\nto  agree  with Members who have spoken before  me\r\n\r\nthat the Minister has treated the subject some-what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo lightly and quoted the official Consumer\r\n\r\nPrice  index  to show that there has only  been  a\r\n\r\nvery  slight  fluctuation in the  monthly  average\r\n\r\nbetween  1969 and 1970. Without knowing the  basis\r\n\r\nupon  which  the  statistics are compiled,  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult for me to quarrel with the figures,  but\r\n\r\nfrom   regular   conversations   held   with    my\r\n\r\nconstituents and judging by the number of  letters\r\n\r\naddressed to the press on the subject lately,  and\r\n\r\nindeed  the complaints made by quite a few Members\r\n\r\nwho  spoke before me, I rather fear that there has\r\n\r\nbeen a definite rise in the overall cost of living\r\n\r\naffecting most, if not all, wage-earners in recent\r\n\r\nmonths.  But  I  have  been  assured  by  reliable\r\n\r\nexperts that the increase in our cost of living is\r\n\r\ncomparatively mild if one considers the trends  in\r\n\r\nother  countries, particularly some  of  the  more\r\n\r\naffluent  countries  such as  the  United  States,\r\n\r\nJapan, Australia and the United Kingdom. Sir, I am\r\n\r\nnot  a unionist but I think it is fair to say that\r\n\r\nthe  relatively  stable  situation  obtaining   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has been due, I think, largely  to  the\r\n\r\nresponsible attitude of our unions in not pressing\r\n\r\nfor   excessive  wage  demands  on  the  slightest\r\n\r\nexcuse,  as is the practice with unions  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries which have bad records of inflation  and\r\n\r\nwhich   suffer  from  the  perennial  problem   of\r\n\r\nspiralling wages and prices. However, the brunt of\r\n\r\nkeeping  inflation  in check  should  not,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  be borne entirely by the workers  alone.\r\n\r\nQuite  apart  from  taking the appropriate  fiscal\r\n\r\nmeasures,  it  is  the duty of the  Government  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a close watch at all times on the  price\r\n\r\nmovements  of necessities, and where unjustifiable\r\n\r\nincreases  take place, it should not be  reluctant\r\n\r\nto  take appropriate action. The Member for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah,  who spoke before me, quoted  the  recent\r\n\r\nprice  increase  in  bread.  I  think  that  is  a\r\n\r\nsituation which I would strongly urge the Minister\r\n\r\nto  look  into. The official Consumer Price  Index\r\n\r\ndoes  not appear to be adequate to do the job  for\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is  intended, and an early  opportunity\r\n\r\nshould be taken to work out a more realistic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nformula  in line with the present-day standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  so  that it would reflect more  accurately\r\n\r\nthe ups and downs of our cost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to make a few observations on\r\n\r\nindustrial   development.  If  success   in   this\r\n\r\ndirection is to be measured in terms of the number\r\n\r\nof  foreign companies we are able to attract here,\r\n\r\nthere   is  no  doubt  that  we  have  been  doing\r\n\r\nextremely well. One has only to look at the number\r\n\r\nof international giants that have set up or are in\r\n\r\nthe   course  of  setting  up  here.  But  in  our\r\n\r\nendeavour  to  attract these foreign companies  to\r\n\r\ncome  in, there is, to my mind, a danger that  our\r\n\r\nentire  economy  may be so geared to  serve  these\r\n\r\ngiants  that  we  may, wittingly  or  unwittingly,\r\n\r\nneglect the need to continue to encourage  and  to\r\n\r\nassist in the development of the medium and  small\r\n\r\nindustries, particularly those started by our  own\r\n\r\nnationals.  I  say this because I have  been  told\r\n\r\nthat   with   increasing  competing  demands   for\r\n\r\nservices  from these big firms, our smaller  firms\r\n\r\nin  both  the manufacturing and other sectors  are\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  experience difficulty in  obtaining\r\n\r\nfinancial support from their bankers who obviously\r\n\r\nconsider  it safer and more profitable to  finance\r\n\r\nthe  established  international  giants  than  the\r\n\r\nsmall  companies with somewhat limited  resources.\r\n\r\nThe  plight of these small industries was  brought\r\n\r\nup   during   a  recent  forum  held  at   Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity which was fully reported in the  press,\r\n\r\nand  it  is unnecessary for me to repeat what  was\r\n\r\nsaid.  What  has  prompted me to bring  forth  the\r\n\r\nmatter is the Minister's quotation of the analysis\r\n\r\nmade  by  Mr  S. Okita, President  of  the  Japan\r\n\r\nEconomic Research Centre. According to Mr  Okita,\r\n\r\nas  quoted by the Minister for Finance, one of the\r\n\r\nreasons that account for Japan's high growth  rate\r\n\r\nis   the   \"widespread  small  and  medium   sized\r\n\r\nindustries    developed    mainly    by    private\r\n\r\ninitiative\".  If we agree with Mr Okita,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  more  should  be done by the  Government  to\r\n\r\nassist in the development of small and medium\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nindustries  and,  in particular,  the  Development\r\n\r\nBank of Singapore should be directed to reserve  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial  part of its available funds  for  the\r\n\r\nspecific   purpose   of  financing   these   small\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, as a Member of Parliament from an\r\n\r\nagricultural  area,  I  would  like  to  associate\r\n\r\nmyself with the sentiments expressed by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong  when  he  spoke on  the  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy,   or   lack  of  policy,  on  agricultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment. I do hope that the Minister will take\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to assess the entire situation and\r\n\r\nformulate a rather more realistic approach to  the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish  to  thank the Minister for Finance  for  his\r\n\r\nAnnual Budget Statement and to congratulate him on\r\n\r\nhis brilliant rendering of the budget, for despite\r\n\r\na  substantial  increase in expenditure  all  year\r\n\r\nround and a reduction in revenue from the duty  on\r\n\r\ncigarettes, he has been able to balance the budget\r\n\r\nwithout  having  to  introduce  new  taxes  or  to\r\n\r\nincrease existing taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have a few points to bring forward. My\r\n\r\nfirst  point  is  that the rising cost  of  living\r\n\r\nduring  the last one year or so has caused concern\r\n\r\namong  the middle income group and hardship  among\r\n\r\nthe lower income group. This is further aggravated\r\n\r\nby  the  declared increase in cost of  basic  food\r\n\r\ncommodities  such  as bread, and  basic  transport\r\n\r\nservices such as buses and taxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am given to understand that the rise in the\r\n\r\ncost of bread is due to an increase in the cost of\r\n\r\nflour  in  the  world market.  This  is  something\r\n\r\nbeyond\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  control.  But I would like  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nenlighten me on the actual increase in the cost of\r\n\r\nflour, and whether it warrants an increase  of  as\r\n\r\nmuch as five cents per loaf of bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Communications has declared that there will be a rise of five cents in bus fares per short trip, even for school children. He has explained that this rise is necessary in order that the bus service can be improved. At the same time, he has also announced the reorganisation of\r\n\r\nthe   bus   companies  so  as  to  improve   their\r\n\r\nefficiency.  Increased  efficiency  brings   along\r\n\r\ngreater  profitability. The increase in bus  fares\r\n\r\nseems  unnecessary at this stage. The  reorganised\r\n\r\nsystem should be first tried out for one year  and\r\n\r\nif  it  is shown that it is not profitable to  run\r\n\r\nit,  then  the  increase in  bus  fares  would  be\r\n\r\njustifiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I want to bring up is the shortage\r\n\r\nof  postmen  in the Postal Department. Our  postal\r\n\r\nservice  is  reputed  to  be  the  best  and  most\r\n\r\nefficient  in  this region, and for  this  I  must\r\n\r\ncongratulate the Minister. With reference  to  the\r\n\r\nbudget  statement, it appears that  there  are  98\r\n\r\nposts for clerical assistants and postmen. I  feel\r\n\r\nthat   unless   the  conditions  of  service   are\r\n\r\nimproved,  it  will not be easy to  recruit  staff\r\n\r\nwithout  the  attraction of  better  salaries  and\r\n\r\nbetter conditions in the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is the spate of resignations of\r\n\r\ndoctors,   particularly  the   more   senior   and\r\n\r\nexperienced ones, from Government service.  Whilst\r\n\r\nI  am  not unaware that the private sector  offers\r\n\r\nbetter financial gains for the specialist doctors,\r\n\r\nI  do  not think that all of them resigned because\r\n\r\nof  this.  I  feel  that if  their  conditions  of\r\n\r\nservice had been improved, some of them would have\r\n\r\nremained in the service or would not have opted to\r\n\r\nretire  at  the earliest available opportunity.  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  the Minister for Health  will  try  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the conditions of service of the  doctors\r\n\r\nand other professional officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point is on the nursing service. I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the nurses have to do seven  days\r\n\r\nof night duty\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  a  stretch, and that they have to do this  one\r\n\r\nweek  of night duty once in five or six weeks.  It\r\n\r\nwould  appear to me that it is quite hard  on  the\r\n\r\nnurses  having  to go on one whole week  of  night\r\n\r\nduty.  I  would like to know if the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth has considered reorganising the duty roster\r\n\r\nof  the nurses so that they can do one night  duty\r\n\r\nin five or six days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fifth and last point is on the improvement of\r\n\r\nour   agriculture  and  husbandry.  Although   our\r\n\r\neconomic expansion has resulted in the building of\r\n\r\nmany  factories and new housing estates, we  still\r\n\r\nhave  plenty of land for the growing of vegetables\r\n\r\nand  for  the  rearing  of pigs  and  fowls.  Most\r\n\r\nprobably  the Minister will say that there  is  no\r\n\r\nland.  I  think Government can buy land  from  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  so  that it  can  introduce  this\r\n\r\nscheme.  In  last year's budget, I mentioned  this\r\n\r\nmatter but it has not been considered. I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier  about the rising cost of living  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  one  of the ways of keeping the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving  down  is  to  increase the  production  of\r\n\r\nessential foods and to ensure that they reach  the\r\n\r\nconsumers  at reasonable prices and  not  sold  at\r\n\r\nhigh  prices because of the middlemen's  making  a\r\n\r\nlarge  profit.  I  would  urge  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nNational  Development  to look  closer  into  this\r\n\r\nproblem by allocating more land in the rural areas\r\n\r\nfor growing vegetables and for rearing of pigs and\r\n\r\nfowls,  and at the same time to study the  methods\r\n\r\nof   distribution  of  their  products  so  as  to\r\n\r\neliminate any possible racketeering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Members of this House should not\r\n\r\nforget   what   happened   during   the   Japanese\r\n\r\nOccupation period. We must always be very careful.\r\n\r\nNow we are preparing to store water in our island.\r\n\r\nWe  are also trying to arrange some storage places\r\n\r\nfor  our vegetables and other essential foodstuffs\r\n\r\nin  case of trouble. God bless that there will  be\r\n\r\nno trouble in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nduring the debate on the budget statement that has\r\n\r\nbeen going\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  this afternoon, I have been wondering, when it\r\n\r\ncame  to my turn, whether I would have to call  my\r\n\r\nbrief  address \"What others say\"! I hope, however,\r\n\r\nthat  I  can think of more interesting  angles  to\r\n\r\n\"What others say\" than a broadcasting programme by\r\n\r\nthe same name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first commend the Minister for Finance on\r\n\r\nan  able, straightforward rendering of his account\r\n\r\nto  Parliament.  The budget statement  reflects  a\r\n\r\nbalance  between  optimism  and  caution,  between\r\n\r\nconfidence  and  realism, and between  far-sighted\r\n\r\nplanning  and  attention to the  practical  ground\r\n\r\ndetails of implementation. There is indeed much in\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Finance Minister has said  that  should\r\n\r\ngive  rise to feelings of satisfaction. Yet  there\r\n\r\nremains a fair bit over which reservations have to\r\n\r\nbe expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such aspect over which I cannot share the\r\n\r\nMinister's  equanimity is what he has referred  to\r\n\r\nas   the   \"relative  stability  in  the   overall\r\n\r\n(Consumer Price) index\". This is where I  come  to\r\n\r\n\"What others say\". I would like to reflect on  and\r\n\r\nto  emphasize what has already been said. If  this\r\n\r\nso-called relative stability means that there  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  a  general rise in the cost of  living,\r\n\r\nespecially in recent months, I am afraid thousands\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans will not agree, Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\ngo  to  the  market, to the barber,  who  buy  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, who sit in the buses, who  go  for  an\r\n\r\noccasional cup of coffee at the coffee-shop  round\r\n\r\nthe  corner, who buy stationery for the kids,  and\r\n\r\nso on and so forth, including many Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse,  especially  the Members  for  Thomson  and\r\n\r\nKampong  Kapor who have tabled questions  on  this\r\n\r\nsame topic. This budget has been described several\r\n\r\ntimes  in this House as a painless one, and indeed\r\n\r\nit  should be, considering the chafing the general\r\n\r\npublic  feel  as a result of the increase  in  the\r\n\r\nprices of a horde of commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all this has not been reflected in the price\r\n\r\nindex, then I am afraid there is a credibility gap\r\n\r\nbetween  the  price  index and the  experience  of\r\n\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr  it  may  be that the official price is  always\r\n\r\nlower than the actual market price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must therefore reflect a fairly common anxiety\r\n\r\nthat careful watch be kept over the situation. One\r\n\r\nmeasure  that  comes soon to mind is the  possible\r\n\r\nsalutary   effect   of   a  consumers'   movement,\r\n\r\nespecially  in relation to commodity  price  rises\r\n\r\nwhich  may  be unwarranted. I have been told  that\r\n\r\nattempts   are  being  made  now  to  register   a\r\n\r\nConsumers' Association. Would the Minister, at  an\r\n\r\nappropriate time, consider giving some  assistance\r\n\r\nto  such  an  association? I  would  imagine  that\r\n\r\ninitially  this association would be  in  need  of\r\n\r\npremises   and  of  funds  for  full-time   staff.\r\n\r\nHowever,   what   this  or   any   other   similar\r\n\r\nassociation would need critically would be  strong\r\n\r\npublic  support. So perhaps the first  thing  that\r\n\r\ncould  be done should be the encouragement of  any\r\n\r\nenterprise that seeks to educate consumers  as  to\r\n\r\nthe  role they may play in getting value for their\r\n\r\nmoney.  I would also urge members to work  through\r\n\r\nresident  associations and the like,  and  through\r\n\r\nagencies  that have been suggested by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong Kapor towards generating consumer co-operation. In any case, it would be interesting to\r\n\r\nnote  what  the  Minister will  say  in  reply  to\r\n\r\nquestions  in the House about the rising  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allied to this feature of living costs is what\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  himself  has  alluded  to  as  \"an\r\n\r\nunprecedented  rise in the cost of new  buildings\"\r\n\r\nreflected  also in an escalation in the prices  of\r\n\r\nproperty.  In view of this, it would  appear  that\r\n\r\nthousands in the middle income group are in danger\r\n\r\nof   being   excluded  from  our   property-owning\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  I  think  it is  time  the  Government\r\n\r\nlooked  into  the  question of building  dwellings\r\n\r\nthat will be within the reach of purchase of those\r\n\r\nwho,  while  drawing  more than  $1,500  in  total\r\n\r\nfamily  income  per month, do not  belong  to  the\r\n\r\nranks  of those who can blithely .pay phenomenally\r\n\r\nhigh prices for houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has rejected as a\r\n\r\nsuggestion  that Government should  go  into  this\r\n\r\narea  of  building houses for those in the  middle\r\n\r\nsocio-economic   group.  He  has  suggested   that\r\n\r\nperhaps  loans  could be increased  in  amount.  I\r\n\r\nwould say that if you borrow more, you would  have\r\n\r\nto pay back more. I would prefer the Government to\r\n\r\ngo  into  this sector. The Jurong Town Corporation\r\n\r\nis  itself going into this sector and I do not see\r\n\r\nwhy  Government should not intensify their efforts\r\n\r\nso  that people like the Member for Whampoa and me\r\n\r\ncould benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to turn to another aspect of the\r\n\r\nbudget statement. The Minister has remarked on the\r\n\r\nnecessity   for  export  orientation,  where   our\r\n\r\nindustries are concerned. And he has said that our\r\n\r\n\"traders  and  manufacturers should  make  greater\r\n\r\nefforts  to penetrate more markets and  make  more\r\n\r\nsales  in  higher  value goods. Greater  promotion\r\n\r\nefforts,  including participation in trade  fairs,\r\n\r\nwould  help.\" I would venture to suggest that  the\r\n\r\nbest form of promotion lies in the quality of  the\r\n\r\ngoods  we produce. All other public relations  and\r\n\r\npromotional   ventures  merely   follow.   It   is\r\n\r\nimportant that we emphasise quality control in our\r\n\r\nfactories. It is true that a number of firms  have\r\n\r\nvoluntarily accepted the need for quality control.\r\n\r\nIndeed  I believe that the Singapore Institute  of\r\n\r\nStandards  and  Industrial  Research  has  already\r\n\r\nawarded  45 quality control certificates,  and  an\r\n\r\nadditional  number of such awards is pending.  But\r\n\r\nmore encouragement and perhaps education has to be\r\n\r\ngiven  to firms which may be a little deterred  by\r\n\r\nthe apparent cost of going in for quality control.\r\n\r\nI say \"apparent cost\", for it would seem that with\r\n\r\nproper and efficient introduction and operation of\r\n\r\nquality   control,  production   would   be   more\r\n\r\neconomical in the long run. This would seem to tie\r\n\r\nup  with  one of the functions which the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  listed  as  contributing to a  high  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate,  namely (I am  quoting  one  of  the\r\n\r\nconditions    listed   by   Mr    Okita)    \"cost\r\n\r\nconsciousness  of  the business enterprises  about\r\n\r\ntheir products\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I say that quality control has to be\r\n\r\nfurther  encouraged.  I  would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  if he will offer tangible incentives  to\r\n\r\nmanufacturers   to   turn  to   quality   control.\r\n\r\n[Interruption] That is one, certainly,  but  first\r\n\r\nthey  will have to be persuaded to go into quality\r\n\r\ncontrol in order to secure profits ultimately. So,\r\n\r\nwill  the  Minister offer incentives like allowing\r\n\r\nan accelerated write-off on capital equipment used\r\n\r\nfor quality control. This has been referred to, if\r\n\r\nI  recollect correctly, but not tangibly. And will\r\n\r\nthe  incentives include a tax allowance in respect\r\n\r\nof  money  spent  in  other ways  besides  capital\r\n\r\nequipment,  e.g., running costs  and  salaries  of\r\n\r\nquality control personnel?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Government should set a\r\n\r\npositive  example  of patronising  products  which\r\n\r\nhave   received  quality  certificates.  In   this\r\n\r\nconnection, if I may repeat what I have said at an\r\n\r\nearlier  sitting, the sending out of instructional\r\n\r\ncirculars  is not enough. I think one has  to  see\r\n\r\nthat implementation is assured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has referred to trade fairs and promotion of trade. Why not start a campaign to sell quality control here in Singapore? Why not have a mass campaign lasting over a reasonable period of time, so that the lesson could be driven home with some effect? If enough international\r\n\r\npublicity  is given to this drive, and if  we  can\r\n\r\nconvey  the  impression that quality  control  and\r\n\r\nreliability  of  products  constitute  matters  of\r\n\r\nserious   national  concern,  then  our   overseas\r\n\r\npromotion and participation in trade fairs will be\r\n\r\nall the more effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to touch briefly on one or\r\n\r\ntwo  other points. The Minister has referred to  a\r\n\r\n\"fast  pace  of  investment  in  imported  capital\r\n\r\ngoods\". I would like to refer to a recent analysis\r\n\r\nin a local newspaper of why a leading manufacturer\r\n\r\nof dressed leather has stopped production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Conceicao, would you like to\r\n\r\ntell  us  which newspaper it is, and when  it  was\r\n\r\npublished?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> This is the Business Times\r\n\r\n(Commercial and Financial See-lion of the  Straits Times)  dated Monday, 15th March, 1971,  page  13,\r\n\r\nand   the   article  is  headed,  \"One  more   DBS\r\n\r\ninvestment turns sour\". It is interesting to  note\r\n\r\nthe  allegation that money was spent on  machinery\r\n\r\nwhich  had  no particular purpose in  the  factory\r\n\r\nright  up  to the demise of the firm. If  this  is\r\n\r\ntrue,  the Minister will no doubt assure  us  that\r\n\r\ngreater  care  is  now  taken,  in  the  case   of\r\n\r\nenterprises in which Government capital  is  sunk,\r\n\r\nto  relate capital expenditure on machinery to the\r\n\r\nneed for such machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to remark that, now that\r\n\r\nmanufacturers' industries \"comprise slightly  more\r\n\r\nthan  a  fifth of the national economic cake\",  we\r\n\r\nwill  take augmented measures to ensure the health\r\n\r\nand  safety of the workers in our industries.

It  is\r\n\r\nquite  clear  that  this painless  budget  is  the\r\n\r\nresult of a series of far-sighted policies carried\r\n\r\nout in the past few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Annual Budget Statement, the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board is going  to  build\r\n\r\nmore flats to house the people. I do not object to\r\n\r\nthe  proposal of building more flats, but what has\r\n\r\nbeen troubling me is the manner in which flats are\r\n\r\nallocated  and  maintained, and the negligence  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of the Housing Board to look after  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of its tenants. I hope that those officers\r\n\r\nin charge of the Board's flats do not get the idea\r\n\r\nthat  the place where the poor people stay  should\r\n\r\nalso look poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many poor families are compelled to squeeze into\r\n\r\none-room  flats allocated to them  more  than  ten\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  Some  of  them  have  been  patiently\r\n\r\nwaiting for about three years for a chance to  get\r\n\r\nan  alternative flat. It is not that they  do  not\r\n\r\nlike  a  change.  Most of these families  are  not\r\n\r\nrich,  but they have a sense of propriety  in  not\r\n\r\nwanting to sleep in the same room with their grown-up  children. Some of these families have  applied\r\n\r\nfor  a  change  on medical grounds, but  even  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of a doctor's written advice attached  to\r\n\r\nthe  application  form  has  not  been  favourably\r\n\r\nconsidered. Perhaps it has never occurred  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing  Board officers that the size of a  family\r\n\r\nmay  increase in the course of time, or  that  the\r\n\r\nchildren will grow up one day. We should not  wait\r\n\r\nfor  a  tragedy to occur, as was reported  in  the\r\n\r\npress, before we dig out the old file in order  to\r\n\r\ngive  sympathetic  consideration,  with  a  guilty\r\n\r\nconscience to an application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board should play a\r\n\r\nmore  active  role  in  safeguarding  the  general\r\n\r\nwelfare   of  its  tenants.  Many  of  them   have\r\n\r\ncomplained  to  the  Board's Area  Officers  about\r\n\r\nnoisy   and   troublesome  neighbours.   But   the\r\n\r\ncomplainants have been told that the Housing Board\r\n\r\ncannot  do  anything with these  culprits  because\r\n\r\nthey pay their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrents  regularly. Even the landlord of  a  private\r\n\r\nhouse  knows how to deal with troublesome tenants.\r\n\r\nIf  the Housing Board cannot effectively deal with\r\n\r\nnoisy  and troublesome tenants, it is useless  for\r\n\r\nthe  Board to beautify the surroundings  with  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  flowers and trees, because the  tenants\r\n\r\nwill not be in the mood to enjoy or appreciate all\r\n\r\nthese beautiful surroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many young people have been seen gambling at staircases in the Housing Board flats. The Housing Board says that gambling is a police matter. Let me point out that the property belongs to the Housing Board and, as a property owner, it should play its part and help the police\r\n\r\nwipe  out gambling inside its own housing estates.\r\n\r\nit  is the duty of the Housing Board inspectors to\r\n\r\nensure   that  Housing  Board  flats  are  legally\r\n\r\noccupied. They should also regard it as their duty\r\n\r\nto   ensure  that  staircases  and  corridors  are\r\n\r\nproperly utilised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board should not only try to build\r\n\r\nmore  flats to house the people, but also try  its\r\n\r\nbest to look after the welfare of its tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.55p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nduring the last few days I went through the budget\r\n\r\nstatement  and the list of tables at  a  leisurely\r\n\r\npace,  and  I  must congratulate the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance   on   having  acquitted   himself   quite\r\n\r\ncreditably    in    precision    and     accuracy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  highlight\r\n\r\ncertain   issues   which  might  require   further\r\n\r\nscrutiny,  and perhaps remedial measures  too.  If\r\n\r\nthe   Finance   Minister  will  take   them   into\r\n\r\nconsideration during the ensuing year, I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthey  will  contribute  to a better  understanding\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Treasury on the  one  side  and  the\r\n\r\nBackbenchers on the other. They will  also  create\r\n\r\nan   atmosphere  more  conducive   to   a   better\r\n\r\nappreciation of the salient features in the budget\r\n\r\namong certain sections of the public. I would also\r\n\r\nlike  to  point out, with facts and  figures,  the\r\n\r\nproblems relating to labour,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nespecially if these issues have either a direct or\r\n\r\nan  indirect bearing on the implementation of  the\r\n\r\nbudget proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year when I spoke on the budget\r\n\r\npresented by the then Finance Minister,  I  raised several  points, and I feel extremely  obliged  to the  Treasury since they have considered them  and have also implemented certain proposals which they have considered to be pragmatic. I have in mind my reference  last year to industrial  accidents  and\r\n\r\nthe  necessity  to  take  sufficient  measures  to\r\n\r\nreduce them to the minimum. In this respect, I  am\r\n\r\ngratified to note that Government has responded to\r\n\r\nmy  suggestion  to  set  up an  Industrial  Safety\r\n\r\nCouncil  at  a national level. I hope the  Council\r\n\r\nwill  sooner or later move in and propose measures\r\n\r\nwhich  will bring the Republic into line with  the\r\n\r\nwestern   countries  with  regard  to   industrial\r\n\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year while analysing the total cargo\r\n\r\ntrade handled at our port, I did point out that it\r\n\r\nmight  increase at a faster pace if the  oil  boom\r\n\r\ncontinued  and the manufacturing sector  responded\r\n\r\nto  the  Finance Minister's treatment. I suggested\r\n\r\nthat  expansion  of  port  facilities  should   be\r\n\r\nplanned sufficiently early. Sir, subsequent events\r\n\r\nhave  proved  that  my analysis  of  the  expected\r\n\r\nincrease  in trade was quite correct. As a  matter\r\n\r\nof  fact, it could be observed from Table IV  that\r\n\r\nthe   total  cargo  handled  increased  from  37.9\r\n\r\nmillion  freight  tons  in 1969  to  42.1  million\r\n\r\nfreight tons in 1970. This is an increase  of  4.2\r\n\r\nmillion  freight tons over a period of 12  months.\r\n\r\nThis  increase  can be further appreciated  if  we\r\n\r\ncompare the increase in 1969 over 1968, which  was\r\n\r\nonly 2.2 million freight tons. In other words, the\r\n\r\nincrease  in  1970 has doubled when compared  with\r\n\r\nthe  increase  in 1969. Mineral oil  continues  to\r\n\r\ncontribute the lion's share of cargo trade handled\r\n\r\nat  our  port.  Nevertheless, the  1970  trade  in\r\n\r\ngeneral cargo has shown an upward trend, which  is\r\n\r\nquite welcome. I have no hesitation in saying that\r\n\r\nfurther encouragement to the manufacturing  sector\r\n\r\nwill  accelerate the growth of the  general  cargo\r\n\r\ntrade at a faster pace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, within a decade the total trade handled at\r\n\r\nour  port has increased from 14.89 million freight\r\n\r\ntons  in  1960  to 42.16 million freight  tons  in\r\n\r\n1970.  This,  in fact, amounts to an  increase  of\r\n\r\n27.27   million  freight  tons  over  the  decade.\r\n\r\nPerhaps our port needs further expansion, and  the\r\n\r\nstaff there might require training to keep up with\r\n\r\nthe  pace. I am eager to know whether the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  will consider it necessary  to  allocate\r\n\r\nmore  funds to expand the port facilities, in view\r\n\r\nof  the considerable rise in the cargo handled  at\r\n\r\nour port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister has also made a reference to\r\n\r\nthe balance of payments position. I am in complete\r\n\r\nagreement  with the Member for Whampoa that  money\r\n\r\nspent in importing capital investment is not a bad\r\n\r\nthing. Sir, I fully appreciate that those who  are\r\n\r\nnot well equipped with the relevant data would  be\r\n\r\nperturbed  by  the trade deficits and  those  with\r\n\r\nquestionable  motives would not hesitate  to  grab\r\n\r\nthe   opportunity  to  run  down   the   republic,\r\n\r\nespecially when they are not too pleased with  our\r\n\r\neconomic progress. They would not hesitate,  in  a\r\n\r\nquixotic manner, to refer gleefully to the alleged\r\n\r\nchronic   deficits  in  the  balance  of  payments\r\n\r\nposition.  I  am  very pleased to  note  that  the\r\n\r\nFinance Minister has ably demonstrated that  there\r\n\r\nis  no  necessity to feel perturbed at our  rather\r\n\r\nlarge trade deficits, since he has proved that the\r\n\r\nbuoyancy  in  imports is mainly due to  the  rapid\r\n\r\npace  of  investment  in imported  capital  goods.\r\n\r\nFurther,  a substantial inflow of foreign capital,\r\n\r\nand   an   appreciable  increase  in  our  foreign\r\n\r\nreserves  along with the efforts made during  last\r\n\r\nyear   in  improving  our  markets  abroad,  would\r\n\r\nindicate  to an impartial observer that  there  is\r\n\r\nabsolutely no necessity for us to view our balance\r\n\r\nof  payments  position with apprehension.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, there is every reason to be satisfied\r\n\r\nwith our past performance and be confident of  our\r\n\r\nfuture prospects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to our export earnings, tourism\r\n\r\nappears  to  have  contributed  substantially.   I\r\n\r\nshould congratulate the Tourist Promotion Board on\r\n\r\nits   yeoman  service  in  increasing  our  dollar\r\n\r\nearning  capacity.  Sir, may I  also  analyse  the\r\n\r\nfigures in Table IV and relate them to the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's  reference to the  economic  activities\r\n\r\nwith regard to tourism? In this respect, I confess\r\n\r\nI am a little confused by the discrepancies in the\r\n\r\nstatistics  provided  by the Finance  Minister  in\r\n\r\nTable IV and in his budget statement. According to\r\n\r\nhim,  the  passenger  traffic  to  Singapore   was\r\n\r\n306,000  in 1965, but Table IV indicates  that  in\r\n\r\n1965  the total figure for passenger arrivals  was\r\n\r\n267,322.  I  really do not know  which  figure  is\r\n\r\ncorrect.  These figures are important  since  they\r\n\r\nwill  enable  us to know to what extent  passenger\r\n\r\ntraffic  has increased during the period  1965  to\r\n\r\n1970.   If   the  budget  statement  figures   are\r\n\r\naccurate,  then  there has  been  an  increase  of\r\n\r\n410,139 in, passenger traffic during 1965 to 1970.\r\n\r\nOn  the  other hand, if we turn to the table,  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in passenger traffic should  be  448,817\r\n\r\nfor  the same period.. In other words, there is  a\r\n\r\ndiscrepancy in the statistics, and the  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  the two increases appears to  be  38,678,\r\n\r\nwhich is quite substantial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have no hesitation in, agreeing with\r\n\r\nthe   Finance  Minister  that  in  1970   we   had\r\n\r\napproximately  25 per cent more visitors  than  in\r\n\r\n1969 and the occupancy rate of 70 per cent for the\r\n\r\ntourist hotels augurs well for our tourist  trade.\r\n\r\nBut  of late I have read in the press extracts  of\r\n\r\nspeeches of responsible leaders to the effect that\r\n\r\nwe have over-built hotels, and that we may have to\r\n\r\ncall  a  halt. Hence, I will very much, appreciate\r\n\r\nit if the Finance Minister can state officially to\r\n\r\nwhat   extent  we  can  give  credence   to   such\r\n\r\nstatements appearing in the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to comment on the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's  reference to the textile industry  and\r\n\r\nits  contribution to our export trade. I have gone\r\n\r\nthrough in detail his reference to the United\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStates  economy, the reintroduction of the  Mill's\r\n\r\nBill   and  the  position  of  Japan.  After   the\r\n\r\npresentation of this budget we also  read  in  the\r\n\r\npress President Nixon's statement in this respect.\r\n\r\nTaking  into account the frequent changes  in  the\r\n\r\nworld textile trade, I wonder whether it might  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  us  to take  a  number  of  policy\r\n\r\nmeasures  so  that the Singapore textile  industry\r\n\r\nmight not be caught unawares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that with a substantial increase in\r\n\r\nproduction and consumption in synthetic fibres  in\r\n\r\nworld trade, Singapore might find it necessary  to\r\n\r\nlay  more emphasis on the development of synthetic\r\n\r\nfabric.  While  recognising  the  fact  that   the\r\n\r\nimposition  of restrictions, or rather  the  quota\r\n\r\nsystem  as  introduced by others might affect  our\r\n\r\nexport  trade, it would be perhaps more  pragmatic\r\n\r\nto  venture into the possibility of entering  into\r\n\r\nhitherto  unexplored markets and conduct immediate\r\n\r\nbilateral    talks   simultaneously    with    our\r\n\r\ntraditional consumer countries in the west for  an\r\n\r\nincrease in export.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The textile industry is labour intensive; hence\r\n\r\nwe  have to work very fast so that there might not\r\n\r\nbe  any unemployment due to import restrictions by\r\n\r\nother  countries. I do not think such a  situation\r\n\r\nwill  arise  since in the past the Government  has\r\n\r\nassessed  the  situation far in advance,  although\r\n\r\nnot long ago the announcement of the British quota\r\n\r\nrestriction did catch us unawares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the Ministry of Education, I am\r\n\r\npleased  to note that with regard to the provision\r\n\r\nof  expenditure, there has been an increase to the\r\n\r\ntune of 9.8 per cent. It is quite substantial but,\r\n\r\nat the same time, I would be failing in my duty if\r\n\r\nI  did  not  point out certain problems which  are\r\n\r\nlikely  to  crop up during 1971 to 1972  when  the\r\n\r\nMinistry intends to recruit more graduate teachers\r\n\r\nin  order  to improve the standard of teaching  in\r\n\r\nthe   secondary   schools.  The  rapid   pace   of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation    has    created     employment\r\n\r\nopportunities   for   our  young   graduates   and\r\n\r\nemoluments paid in the private\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsector are more attractive than those provided  by\r\n\r\nthe   Education  Ministry.  Hence,  it  might   be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to fill the vacancies unless incentives\r\n\r\nare created by the Education Ministry. It could be\r\n\r\nin  the  form  of adjustments in total emoluments,\r\n\r\nbetter    promotional   prospects   and    further\r\n\r\nopportunity for oversea training programmes.  This\r\n\r\nmight result in further allocation of funds to the\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry  if  the  main  objective   of\r\n\r\nrecruiting more graduate teachers in 1971-72 is to\r\n\r\nbe achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at the very outset of my speech I did mention that I shall make pointed reference to problems pertaining to labour and, if possible, to highlight the issues which hitherto might not have received sufficient attention. I have no intention to cross swords with the Treasury bench\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  the  quantum  of  funds  to   be\r\n\r\nallocated  to  the  Labour  Ministry.  I  am  more\r\n\r\nconcerned with policy issues and labour laws since\r\n\r\nthere  is a necessity to analyse them with a  view\r\n\r\nto  assessing their impact, positive or  negative,\r\n\r\non    the   successful   implementation   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   industrialisation  programme   with\r\n\r\nadequate  emphasis  on human factors.  As  we  are\r\n\r\naware, our Prime Minister has often stressed  that\r\n\r\nhuman    endeavour   should   receive   sufficient\r\n\r\nattention  in any economic development  programme.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, I would like to point out that\r\n\r\nthe measures taken by the Government are bound  to\r\n\r\nbe  more  effective  and  the  Finance  Minister's\r\n\r\napproach towards development expenditure would  be\r\n\r\nmore  fruitful if certain measures  are  taken  to\r\n\r\nbring  some  of the labour laws in line  with  our\r\n\r\nimmediate requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, I have in mind the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act, and although by and large it might\r\n\r\nbe  a  necessity  within the overall  strategy  of\r\n\r\nspeedy economic development, of course it must  be\r\n\r\ndone  within the framework of healthy  labour  and\r\n\r\ncapital  relations. I have in mind the  fact  that\r\n\r\ncertain amendments are necessary, especially  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  section  46  of  the  Employment   Act\r\n\r\nrelating to bonus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npayment.  The Act stipulates bonus as one  month's\r\n\r\nsalary,  although it does not prevent any employer\r\n\r\nfrom  paying more on a voluntary basis.  You  will\r\n\r\nagree  with me, Sir, that an employer is not  much\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  paying  more  bonus,  since   the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  paying bonus is tied up  with  profit\r\n\r\nsharing  or profitability. The only item  that  an\r\n\r\nemployer is really concerned with is the  cost  of\r\n\r\nwages  bill. It is not so much the bonus,  because\r\n\r\nyou  do not pay bonus if you do not make a profit.\r\n\r\nBut  in  the  case of wages, whether  an  employer\r\n\r\nmakes  a profit or not, every year he is committed\r\n\r\nto paying wages to the workers. Therefore, instead\r\n\r\nof  making  a limitation on the bonus  payment,  I\r\n\r\nwould  rather  prefer that the union  should  take\r\n\r\nthis  point  into  consideration;  that  is,   the\r\n\r\nmembers of a union should not revise their  salary\r\n\r\nscale  whenever  a  collective agreement  expires,\r\n\r\nbecause  in  the collective agreement the  `salary\r\n\r\nscale  is projected to a period of, say, 12 years,\r\n\r\nand  if  one has not reached the top of the scale,\r\n\r\nthere  is no necessity to revise the whole  salary\r\n\r\nscale.  There  is  already an automatic  increment\r\n\r\nevery  year. If this can be accepted, I  think  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  attract  more  investors  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But  certainly the  bonus  restriction\r\n\r\nwill  not  really cause the employer  to  be  much\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  it. I would  advocate  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment take this into consideration and remove\r\n\r\nthe  bonus  restriction as  quickly  as  possible.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the restrictive provision of  this\r\n\r\nsection,  many employers continue to  pay  a  much\r\n\r\nhigher  bonus than what is provided  in  the  Act.\r\n\r\nThis proves that my statement is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the passage of the Employment Act in 1968,\r\n\r\nemployers  who can afford to pay a bonus  continue\r\n\r\nto  pay  more than one month's bonus.  That  shows\r\n\r\nthat the Act does not restrict the employer on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  bonus payment. It  depends  on  `the\r\n\r\ncapacity  to  pay,  and the profit-sharing  motive\r\n\r\napparently   dominates  the   approach   of   both\r\n\r\nmanagement  and labour on the bonus issue.  Hence,\r\n\r\nthe original fear which prompted the law-maker  to\r\n\r\ninclude  section  46  in the  Act  appears  to  be\r\n\r\nunwarranted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexcept  for the fact that this particular  section\r\n\r\ncan  be  abused by a minority of well  established\r\n\r\nemployers in denying labour its legitimate rights.\r\n\r\nFor   example,  I  think  all  Members  must  have\r\n\r\nreceived  copies  of a letter from  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nBank Employees' Union informing them how the banks\r\n\r\ntook advantage of section 46 of the Employment Act\r\n\r\nto  coerce  the  Union into signing  a  collective\r\n\r\nagreement. I feel very strongly that we should  do\r\n\r\nsomething about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to refer to Table VA on the\r\n\r\nLabour Department's figures. The Labour Department\r\n\r\nfigures indicate that the number of man-days  lost\r\n\r\nin  strikes  in  1970 has been the lowest  over  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  10 years. Hence, there is no necessity\r\n\r\nto   have  second  thoughts  that  if  the   bonus\r\n\r\nlimitation  is removed, there would be trouble.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  so. Since within a period  of  ten\r\n\r\nyears,  the number of man-days lost in strikes  in\r\n\r\n1970  has been the lowest, we should not be unduly\r\n\r\nafraid of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also referred in his budget statement to the expected complete British withdrawal and the possible retrenchment of 15,000 civilian employees in the immediate future. I feel that the majority of the workers cannot be re-trained or re-moulded to fit into our modern industries, since most of them belong to the 40-50\r\n\r\nage  group.  Hence I might suggest that  with  the\r\n\r\nassistance  of the workers, the N.T.U.C, and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, joint ventures could be established on\r\n\r\na  co-operative  basis with the  capital  provided\r\n\r\nfrom  the provident fund and retrenchment benefits\r\n\r\nof  the  workers and also with adequate assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  the Government. The N.T.U.C, could take  the\r\n\r\ninitiative in setting up such enterprises provided\r\n\r\nthe Government could give the green light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that we need not have to refer to the pages of Paul Sweezy to know more about the approach towards the welfare state. As it stands now, our Gross Domestic Product is one of the highest in this region. Under such circumstances, it is only natural that as far as\r\n\r\npossible  social amenities should be  provided  at\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpense of the state so that the man in the street\r\n\r\nwill  derive the maximum benefit. But it is rather\r\n\r\nstrange  that  during the past few years,  as  the\r\n\r\nG.D.P, bounces  forward, existing  free  benefits\r\n\r\nhave  been  slowly  and steadily  removed  by  the\r\n\r\nstate.  I  have in mind the disappearance  of  the\r\n\r\nfree medical benefits both for outpatients and in-patients  which  existed a few  years  ago.  Today\r\n\r\nadmission into a 3rd class ward costs S  1.50  per\r\n\r\nday,  while SI is charged on the individual if  he\r\n\r\nderives medical benefits as an outpatient. Sir, in\r\n\r\nkeeping with our welfare state concept and  taking\r\n\r\ninto  account  the  substantial  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nG.D.P., the state should abolish medical fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have only to add that in the turbulent\r\n\r\npolitical  and  economic situation  in  South-east\r\n\r\nAsia our young republic continues to surge forward\r\n\r\nnot  only  with political stability but also  with\r\n\r\nsufficient economic nourishment as provided by the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister, who deserves appreciation  from\r\n\r\nall sections of this House for presenting a budget\r\n\r\nwhich contains no negative punches or pulls but  a\r\n\r\npositive  thrust  which explicitly  expresses  the\r\n\r\ndesire  and determination to move forward  without\r\n\r\nundue haste or hesitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to associate myself with the\r\n\r\nsentiments   expressed   by   my   colleagues   in\r\n\r\nsupporting the budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  recall  that  the  day  after   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance presented his maiden  budget\r\n\r\nstatement in: this Chamber, he received a  lot  of\r\n\r\npraise and all-round applause from the tycoons  of\r\n\r\nthe  various  Chambers of Commerce,  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  the  big industrialists.  But  the\r\n\r\ngrouses  and  the views of the man in the  street,\r\n\r\nthe  wage  earners, the taxi drivers, the  hawkers\r\n\r\nand  the workers still await a sympathetic hearing\r\n\r\nfrom  the Minister for Finance. I am sure  Members\r\n\r\nhave already heard enough of this and perhaps more\r\n\r\nwill   be   spelt   out  by  my  colleagues,   the\r\n\r\nBackbenchers, later on in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I am speaking mainly on the acute problems\r\n\r\nwhich  are  facing my constituency. In the  budget\r\n\r\nstatement  of  the  Minister  for  Finance,  which\r\n\r\nindeed  is  remarkable  and  impressive  for   its\r\n\r\ncontents  and length, I fail to see any  immediate\r\n\r\nplan   being  mentioned  to  offset  the  economic\r\n\r\nproblems and hardships arising out of the  British\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  at  the end of the  year  from  R.A.F.\r\n\r\nChangi  which  is the last leg of  the  operation.\r\n\r\nMembers will appreciate my deep concern over  this\r\n\r\nmatter.  The largest Royal Air Force  base  is  at\r\n\r\nChangi  where  nearly 5,000 employees  earn  their\r\n\r\nliving  and where the livelihood of many thousands\r\n\r\nof people of all walks of life will be immediately\r\n\r\nand indirectly affected. Sir, the vacuum that will\r\n\r\nbe created by the British withdrawal, with nothing\r\n\r\nto   cushion  the  ill  effects,  will  plunge  my\r\n\r\nconstituents into hardship and set them back. I am\r\n\r\nafraid  it  may even be a source of social  unrest\r\n\r\nand,  because  of its contagious  nature,  it  may\r\n\r\ninfect  other  areas  in the  republic.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\npeople who will be adversely affected are not only\r\n\r\nthose  citizens who .are directly employed by  the\r\n\r\nBritish  services in Changi, but also others  like\r\n\r\ndomestic   servants,   petty   traders,   hawkers,\r\n\r\nshopkeepers, taxi drivers, gardeners and a host of\r\n\r\nothers  who  in one way or another depend  on  the\r\n\r\nBritish services' spending to earn their living at\r\n\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reliably informed that more than 250\r\n\r\ncivilian  employees  and their  families  who  are\r\n\r\naccommodated  in R.A.F, quarters  at  Changi  have\r\n\r\nbeen  warned  recently that they  have  to  vacate\r\n\r\ntheir quarters within two months of their becoming\r\n\r\nredundant.  It  is  also gathered  that  civilians\r\n\r\naffected  by  redundancy are  required  to  vacate\r\n\r\ntheir premises even though the houses are going to\r\n\r\nremain  vacant thereafter. Sir, these  unfortunate\r\n\r\nemployees will suddenly find themselves confronted\r\n\r\nwith  a  multitude  of problems  which  cannot  be\r\n\r\nsolved  by  their  own  efforts  alone,  and   the\r\n\r\napparent  absence  of Government  assistance  will\r\n\r\nleave  them  in  a completely hopeless  situation.\r\n\r\nTrue,  there  are talks of converting  Changi  Air\r\n\r\nBase into an industrial complex whereby\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese people could be absorbed into industry.  But\r\n\r\nthis conversion can only be done after the British\r\n\r\nhave left. What happens in the interim?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disturbing silence on this matter in the\r\n\r\nMinister's  statement raises  doubts  whether  the\r\n\r\nmuch talked about conversion will actually come to\r\n\r\nfruition. If the Government has devised plans  for\r\n\r\nthe  conversion of Changi Airport, why should  the\r\n\r\nMinister  not  spell them Out  in  his  statement?\r\n\r\nAfter all, to feed many thousands of hungry mouths\r\n\r\nis  no  small  matter; that could not  be  lightly\r\n\r\nignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These civilian employees are unable to rent\r\n\r\nprivate  estate  houses because these  are  beyond\r\n\r\ntheir  financial  capacity. Still  less  can  they\r\n\r\nafford  to buy their own houses as they are unable\r\n\r\nto  draw their gratuity in a lump sum. Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board flats would be ideal  for  them,\r\n\r\nbut  there are none in Changi Constituency at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.  The  problem  of accommodation  is  their\r\n\r\nbiggest  worry:  it is haunting these  unfortunate\r\n\r\npeople.  It is more serious than being unemployed,\r\n\r\nbecause at least they have their gratuity to  fall\r\n\r\nback  on  for a hand-to-mouth existence till  they\r\n\r\nfind other alternative employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education of the children of these\r\n\r\nunfortunate  people  poses  yet  another   anxious\r\n\r\nproblem. There are bound to be adverse effects  on\r\n\r\nthe children's education. If they are to move from\r\n\r\nChangi to other parts of Singapore, you will agree\r\n\r\nwith   me-  Mr  Sneaker,  Sir,  that  the  sudden\r\n\r\ndislocation  is  bound to disrupt their  education\r\n\r\neven if they are lucky enough to get admission  to\r\n\r\nschools  in their new areas of residence. In  this\r\n\r\nconnection, I wish to know if it would be possible\r\n\r\nto   leave  R.A.F, civilian  employees  in  their\r\n\r\npresent    accommodation    even    after    their\r\n\r\nretrenchment  until alternative  accommodation  is\r\n\r\navailable to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is nearly four years now since the then\r\n\r\nBritish Labour Government announced the withdrawal\r\n\r\nof  British  forces from the republic. Surely  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  must have plans concerning Changi  Air\r\n\r\nBase which can be implemented\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimmediately  so as to solve  the  economic\r\n\r\ndepression   in  Changi  Constituency.   Can   the\r\n\r\nMinister enlighten this House on what solutions he\r\n\r\nhas  to relieve the people of their anxiety  about\r\n\r\ntheir future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to join other Members on this side  of\r\n\r\nthe  House in commending the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\non  presenting  his first budget speech  which  is\r\n\r\nsensible, balanced and most welcome to the public.\r\n\r\nIt  is a painless budget without the necessity  of\r\n\r\nintroducing  new taxes or increasing the  existing\r\n\r\nrates of taxes. As the Minister has mentioned, the\r\n\r\naccelerated run-down of the British military bases\r\n\r\nwill commence this month, and will be completed by\r\n\r\nthe end of the year. This operation will result in\r\n\r\na loss of British military spending to the tune of\r\n\r\n$300  million, yet the Minister does  not  foresee\r\n\r\nany  necessity for additional taxation. This bears\r\n\r\ntestimony  to our healthy economic growth  and  to\r\n\r\nthe  success  of our industrialisation  programme.\r\n\r\nThis  happy state of our economy has been  brought\r\n\r\nabout  in a large measure, as reflected in the  15\r\n\r\nper cent growth, by the wise and bold planning  of\r\n\r\nhis  predecessor, Dr Gob Keng Swee,  and  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  own active and vigorous  execution  of\r\n\r\nthis  economic policy when he was the Chairman  of\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Development Board, and at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  by the contributions made by the disciplined\r\n\r\nand  very adaptable workers of our republic  under\r\n\r\nthe able leadership of the N.T.U.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I remind the Members for Telok Blangah and\r\n\r\nMoulmein  that  not  every  employer  is   a   bad\r\n\r\nemployer. They have transformed the destiny of the\r\n\r\nrepublic  from  one of utter gloom and  pessimism,\r\n\r\nsoon  after separation from a neighbouring country\r\n\r\nto  one of healthy optimism and growing affluence,\r\n\r\nwhich  promises a more equitable and just  society\r\n\r\nwith  equal  opportunities for  all,  and  with  a\r\n\r\nhigher  standard of living than at present,  which\r\n\r\nis  already one of the highest in Asia in the `80s\r\n\r\ngiven  political  stability and security  in  this\r\n\r\nregion. But with all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  optimism  and  accelerated  growth  on   the\r\n\r\neconomic front, I wish to make one observation  in\r\n\r\nregard   to   technical  training  and   technical\r\n\r\neducation in that part of his budget statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget for 1971-72 presented by the Minister is to promote greater growth in strong and export-oriented industries. To achieve this objective, every ingenious fiscal inducement is being thought out and legislated to attract large foreign enterprises which enjoy prestige in international markets like the giant corporations of Rollei,\r\n\r\nRockwell,  Plessey, Philips, etc. As a  result  of\r\n\r\nthe expanding economy and rapid industrialisation,\r\n\r\nthere are already ominous signs of a creeping cost\r\n\r\nof  living and an escalation of the wage rates  of\r\n\r\nsemi-skilled  and skilled men in the manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries. Unless measures are brought  forth  to\r\n\r\narrest this inflationary trend, the republic  will\r\n\r\nsoon  become priced out of the export  markets  in\r\n\r\nthe  services  we can offer. This trend  has  been\r\n\r\nbrought  about  by  the great  influx  of  foreign\r\n\r\nmanagement  and technical personnel  belonging  to\r\n\r\nthese  enterprises,  but these foreign  managerial\r\n\r\nand  technical personnel are most welcome  to  our\r\n\r\nrepublic  in imparting the technical know-how  and\r\n\r\nexpertise  to  their local counterparts  in  these\r\n\r\nindustries. Unfortunately, for the majority of us,\r\n\r\nthey have also large spending powers which have  a\r\n\r\ndirect   bearing  on  our  commodity  and  service\r\n\r\nprices.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  a  great\r\n\r\nshortage of skilled manpower, resulting in too few\r\n\r\nmen  chasing too many jobs. Although every  effort\r\n\r\nis  being  exerted  to create  a  more  favourable\r\n\r\ninvestment  climate, a shift of  greater  emphasis\r\n\r\nhas  been  necessary  on a new educational  policy\r\n\r\nfrom  one  of  academic type  to  one  of  a  more\r\n\r\ntechnical  bias  by training,  and  to  produce  a\r\n\r\ngreater number of tertiary and technician echelons\r\n\r\nof  skilled personnel. But are we doing enough  in\r\n\r\nthe  technical education field, as industries  and\r\n\r\nnational services are competing for the output  of\r\n\r\ntertiary  technician and vocational  graduates?  I\r\n\r\nconcur with the view of the Member for Whampoa for\r\n\r\na  co-ordinating manpower body to be set  up.  The\r\n\r\ntime is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nripe  and  necessary to establish  a  high-powered\r\n\r\nnational  central council to co-ordinate and  plan\r\n\r\nthe  manpower requirements of our republic so that\r\n\r\nthe  input  has a direct bearing on the output  of\r\n\r\nthe graduates. One can see from the estimates that\r\n\r\non  a tertiary level we have a situation where the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore and the Polytechnic  are\r\n\r\nunder the Ministry of Science and Technology,  and\r\n\r\nNanyang University and Ngee Ann College under  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education. Unless quick  and  urgent\r\n\r\nsteps  are  taken to centralise the  co-ordination\r\n\r\nand  training  of skilled manpower, both  for  the\r\n\r\nindustries  and the military requirements  at  all\r\n\r\nlevels,  the republic may be caught on  the  wrong\r\n\r\nfoot  with all foreign investments coming in on  a\r\n\r\nlarge scale, as predicted by the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has mentioned in his speech that at the\r\n\r\nbeginning   of  1971  the  total  direct   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments in manufacturing industries will total\r\n\r\n$1,700  million,  and will be in  full  production\r\n\r\nfrom two to five years. Assuming an investment  of\r\n\r\n$30,000  will create one job for one  worker,  the\r\n\r\ntotal number of people who will find employment in\r\n\r\nthese  newly-created  industries  alone  will   be\r\n\r\n56,000.  What  will  be the requirements  for  the\r\n\r\nother sectors? From the figures obtained from  the\r\n\r\nYear  Book of Statistics, 1969, the University  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Nanyang University produced  1,639\r\n\r\ngraduates at tertiary level in 1969, whereas  only\r\n\r\n593  graduates at technician level passed out from\r\n\r\nthe  Polytechnic and Ngee Ann College in the  same\r\n\r\nyear. The technical and vocational institutes  and\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Training Centre turned  out  4,129\r\n\r\ngraduates between the ages of 17 and 19  at  craft\r\n\r\nand trade levels. As soon as they passed out, they\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be taken into national service.  In\r\n\r\nadvanced  and  developed countries, the  ratio  of\r\n\r\ntertiary  to technician and craft level is  1:  5:\r\n\r\n25, whereas in our case it is 3: 1: 7. Although  I\r\n\r\nam aware that from now onwards national servicemen\r\n\r\nwho  have undergone two years of full-time service\r\n\r\nwill be discharged, I propose to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment that before they are discharged  on  to\r\n\r\nthe  employment market, they should  be  given  at\r\n\r\nleast   six   months   of   industrial   training.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  cannot  see  how  we  can   prevent\r\n\r\ncrimping   on  a  large  scale  in  the   existing\r\n\r\nindustries,  resulting  in inflated  salaries  and\r\n\r\nwage rates to the detriment of the economy of  the\r\n\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to sound an alarmist but I must warn this House that quick and concrete measures must be adopted to solve this manpower problem if we are to face our future with optimism, as outlined by the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to our progress and economic growth in\r\n\r\nthe  years to come is our human asset, which  will\r\n\r\nplay  the most important role in making our nation\r\n\r\na  viable,  independent and sovereign  country  in\r\n\r\nwhich both men and women must play their effective\r\n\r\ncontributory part. Therefore, in this context,  we\r\n\r\nmust also induce more of our female population  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  skills and work side by side with  their\r\n\r\nmenfolk not only in the light industries but  also\r\n\r\nin  the  heavy  metal industries as they  are  not\r\n\r\nliable for national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the 1971-72 budget.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  people of Singapore are happy  to  know\r\n\r\nthat there will be no increase of any tax for  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year  1st April, 1971, to  31st  March,\r\n\r\n1972, as announced by the Minister for Finance  in\r\n\r\nhis  annual budget statement in Parliament on  the\r\n\r\n8th  of  March,  1971.  Since  there  will  be  no\r\n\r\nincrease of any tax for this period, it will  give\r\n\r\nemployers   the   opportunity  to   expand   their\r\n\r\nindustries  and make more profit. It will  attract\r\n\r\nmore  investors  to come here and will  definitely\r\n\r\ncreate more jobs for the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the present industrial boom and several\r\n\r\nemployers making good profit, I think the time has\r\n\r\ncome for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendments to be made to the Employment Act  which\r\n\r\nwas  implemented in 1968, particularly  about  the\r\n\r\nbonus  payment. I would like to join other Members\r\n\r\nin  this House and strongly request the Government\r\n\r\nto  remove  the  limitation on the negotiation  of\r\n\r\nbonus  payment  to  one month only.  I  think  the\r\n\r\nbigger the profit, the bigger should be the bonus.\r\n\r\nThe workers should be given the right to negotiate\r\n\r\nfor a bigger bonus with their employers so long as\r\n\r\nthey have the capacity to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prices of new and existing houses have been\r\n\r\nrising  fantastically during the last five  years.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the  price of a terrace  house  was\r\n\r\nabout  $30,000 five years ago, but if you  buy  it\r\n\r\nnow you will have to pay $55,000 for it. Prices of\r\n\r\nhouses  have  gone  up so high that  workers  find\r\n\r\ndifficulty  purchasing  them.  Luckily,  they  can\r\n\r\npurchase Housing and Development Board flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the workers find difficulty in buying\r\n\r\nhouses  from the private sector on account of  the\r\n\r\nfantastically high prices, may I suggest that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment allow the family combined salary  limit\r\n\r\nto  be $1,700 to purchase H.D.B, flats rather than\r\n\r\nthe present limit of $1,200?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order not to allow the private sector to keep\r\n\r\non  building houses and making fantastic  profits,\r\n\r\nmay  I suggest to the Government to build as  many\r\n\r\nH.D.B, flats as possible and to limit the building\r\n\r\nof  houses  by  the  private sector?  The  private\r\n\r\nsector is the main cause of the fantastic rise  in\r\n\r\nthe prices of houses built by them. We must put an\r\n\r\nimmediate stop to it without further delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the Minister for Finance in his annual\r\n\r\nbudget  statement says that he is keeping a  close\r\n\r\nwatch on the unprecedented rise in the cost of new\r\n\r\nbuildings  and the value of the existing buildings\r\n\r\nso as to prevent the cost increase from developing\r\n\r\nto serious proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully agree with the views expressed by\r\n\r\nother   Members  of  this  House  on  the  present\r\n\r\nincrease of prices\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   various  commodities,  and  I  support  their\r\n\r\nproposal that action should be taken to put a stop\r\n\r\nto  it. I also request the Minister for Finance to\r\n\r\nput a stop to the arbitrary increase of prices  of\r\n\r\ncommodities by business associations, for example,\r\n\r\nthe  increase in the price of bread by the  Bakers\r\n\r\nAssociation  recently.  If the  Government  allows\r\n\r\nthese  business  associations  to  increase  their\r\n\r\nprices arbitrarily, then the Government should not\r\n\r\nstop  the  unions  from demanding  arbitrarily  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  wages and bonus. Unfortunately,  the\r\n\r\nunions  are  not  allowed to do  so.  Workers  are\r\n\r\nrequested to endure all the restrictions  enforced\r\n\r\nin the Employment Act, for example, longer working\r\n\r\nhours,  a  lesser  number of  public  holidays,  a\r\n\r\nlimitation  to  the annual bonus  to  one  month's\r\n\r\nsalary only, etc. But there are no restrictions on\r\n\r\nthe  employers and the business associations. They\r\n\r\ncan  increase  the  prices  of  their  commodities\r\n\r\narbitrarily.   This  is  most   unfair   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment must stop this squeezing on the public.\r\n\r\nThe  workers,  especially those with lower  wages,\r\n\r\nare  suffering terribly. The Government must  stop\r\n\r\npampering  the employers too much,  and  pay  more\r\n\r\nattention to the workers and relieve their  plight\r\n\r\nas soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the budgetpresented by the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I rise to thank the Minister for Finance  for\r\n\r\nhis  budget  speech in Parliament  on  8th  March,\r\n\r\n1971.  However,  I  would like  to  speak  on  one\r\n\r\nsubject,  appearing  in  col.  574  [Hansard,  8th\r\n\r\nMarch,  1971], in connection with workers' safety,\r\n\r\nas  my colleagues in the N.T.U.C, have dealt  with\r\n\r\nthe  other  aspects of Government policy  for  the\r\n\r\nfinancial year 1971-72.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that Government has at\r\n\r\nlong last awakened to the fact that the number  of\r\n\r\nindustrial   accidents  resulting  in   death   or\r\n\r\npermanent disablement has reached alarmingly  high\r\n\r\nproportions. In this respect, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment's  decision to strengthen  the  Factory\r\n\r\nInspectorate  in the Ministry of  Labour  is  most\r\n\r\nwelcome. While it is gratifying to learn that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  taken  a positive  step  at  this\r\n\r\njuncture, it cannot be complimented at all on  its\r\n\r\nutter  lack  of  foresight in providing  effective\r\n\r\nlegislation  to protect the safety  of  industrial\r\n\r\nworkers. Nor can it be complimented on its lack of\r\n\r\nconcern  and interest in enforcing the rudimentary\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the Factories Ordinance to  protect\r\n\r\nthe  safety of industrial workers. Nor can  it  be\r\n\r\ncomplimented  on having shown any  awareness  that\r\n\r\nthe   number  of  industrial  accidents  has  been\r\n\r\nincreasing from month to month, from year to year,\r\n\r\nin   the  last  ten  years  since  we  began   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will remember that on the 23rd December,\r\n\r\n1969,  I  asked in this House [Hansard,  Vol.  29,\r\n\r\ncols. 242-6] whether the Government would consider\r\n\r\nincreasing  the staff in the Factory  Inspectorate\r\n\r\nas  a  matter of urgency and importance.  But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  not  too  responsive  then.  Time\r\n\r\npassed and the situation became worse. During last\r\n\r\nyear's budget debate I had occasion on 20th March,\r\n\r\n1970  [Hansard, Vol. 29, cols. 834-8], to propose,\r\n\r\namong other things, firstly, to increase the staff\r\n\r\nin  the Factory Inspectorate; secondly, to upgrade\r\n\r\nthe   skill   of  inspectors  to  enforce   safety\r\n\r\nprovisions;  and,  thirdly, to introduce  stronger\r\n\r\nlegislative  measures to promote  the  safety  and\r\n\r\nhealth of workers. I am somewhat pleased that  the\r\n\r\nstrength  of  the  Factory Inspectorate  has  been\r\n\r\nincreased  by  30  last year, under  Establishment\r\n\r\nWarrant, to meet the urgency of the situation. But\r\n\r\nI  must  caution that it is hardly  reasonable  to\r\n\r\nexpect  dramatic  improvements  immediately   just\r\n\r\nbecause   of  the  recruitment  of  six   untested\r\n\r\ntechnical officers, 16 technicians, and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is need for an overall change of attitude\r\n\r\nfrom  all quarters in industry. Not only is  there\r\n\r\nignorance and apathy among the workers, but  there\r\n\r\nis also utter disregard among employers in general\r\n\r\nto protect the safety of workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat  is  most important in the month of employers\r\n\r\nis  the  attainment of low cost and  high  profits\r\n\r\ncarried   out   in   the  name  of   productivity,\r\n\r\ndisregarding the safety of workers in  the  course\r\n\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A typical example of, the general attitude of\r\n\r\nemployers can be cited from what happened  at  the\r\n\r\nMandarin  Hotel.  When the first  building  worker\r\n\r\nfell  into  .a lift-well and died, the  contractor\r\n\r\nwas  advised  to  supply his workers  with  safety\r\n\r\nbelts. I do not know who advised him - it could be\r\n\r\nthe  Factory  Inspectorate - but  he  did  not  do\r\n\r\nanything.  Then another worker fell and died.  But\r\n\r\nstill  no  safety belts were supplied. And  it  is\r\n\r\nshocking  to learn that safety belts were supplied\r\n\r\nonly one day before the Coroner's inquiry into the\r\n\r\ndeath of the second worker. The verdict was \"Death\r\n\r\nby   misadventure\".  The  Coroner  said,  \"Workers\r\n\r\nworking  in  such hazardous situations  should  be\r\n\r\nprovided with safety measures, and it is up to the\r\n\r\nproper  authorities to enforce it.\" Sir, I believe\r\n\r\nthat  a  dozen  men working at this  hotel  downed\r\n\r\ntheir tools when the second man fell to his death.\r\n\r\nI  have  always thought that requests  for  safety\r\n\r\nmeasures would be reasonable to ensure the  safety\r\n\r\nof  lives.  When  life is at stake,  there  is  no\r\n\r\ncompromise.  What happened at the  Mandarin  Hotel\r\n\r\nwas not death by misadventure of accidental death,\r\n\r\nbut  homicide  -  a  clear  and  simple  case   of\r\n\r\nhomicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The N.T.U.C, is embarking on a programme to\r\n\r\ninstil  safety  consciousness among  workers.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  on its part must give top priority  to\r\n\r\nits  social policy of providing a better and safer\r\n\r\nworking  environment. The N.T.U.C, was  extremely\r\n\r\nglad  that Dr Goh Keng Swee, the former  Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Finance,   creator  and  promoter   of   our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme,  had  proposed   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  a Council of Industrial  Safety\r\n\r\nand  Health. We welcome it and we agree  with  the\r\n\r\never-wise Minister that the Council should not  be\r\n\r\njust  another  forum. The N.T.U.C, has  taken  the\r\n\r\ninitiative to set in motion the final establishment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  such a council. It has obtained  general\r\n\r\nagreement  on  the  terms  of  reference  of  this\r\n\r\ncouncil. Besides the N.T.U.C., notably the  Jurong\r\n\r\nTown  Corporation, the National Employers Council,\r\n\r\nthe  National  Productivity Centre,  the  National\r\n\r\nSafety  First  Council,  the  Singapore  Employers\r\n\r\nFederation,     the    Singapore     Manufacturers\r\n\r\nAssociation,  the  Singapore Medical  Association,\r\n\r\nthe   Society   for  Occupational  Medicine,   the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of Singapore (Faculty of Engineering),\r\n\r\nthe  Institution of Engineers, and the  Department\r\n\r\nof  Social  Medicine  and  Public  Health  of  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore, have all subscribed  to\r\n\r\nthe  principles  laid down in  the  memorandum  of\r\n\r\nagreement. It is important to note that  never  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  have  all these organisations  come  to\r\n\r\ngeneral  agreement and resolution to  undertake  a\r\n\r\nproject  of  the  utmost  social  importance.  The\r\n\r\nDirector of the National Productivity Centre,  who\r\n\r\nchaired  the  press conference  before  the  joint\r\n\r\nmemorandum  of  agreement  was  presented  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Labour, said that\r\n\r\nthere  was full, free and frank discussion on  the\r\n\r\nfeasibility of establishing an advisory  committee\r\n\r\non  industrial  safety and  health  and  that  the\r\n\r\nreport would be of benefit to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During last year's budget debate I drew the\r\n\r\nattention  of the House to the number  of  workers\r\n\r\nwho  were  injured  and disabled  permanently,  or\r\n\r\nwhose  injuries had resulted in death. I think  it\r\n\r\nis  worth while to quote these figures, so that it\r\n\r\ncan  register in our minds once and  for  all  the\r\n\r\nseriousness of the situation. The number of  fatal\r\n\r\nand  permanent  disablement cases for  the  period\r\n\r\n1960-69 were:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n             1960      242\r\n\r\n             1961      389\r\n\r\n             1962      480\r\n\r\n             1963      559\r\n\r\n             1964      533\r\n\r\n             1965      637\r\n\r\n             1966      660\r\n\r\n             1967      659\r\n\r\n             1968      804\r\n\r\n             1969      864\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor  1970, I believe the average number  of  fatal\r\n\r\ncases is not less than 12 a month.

I   wish   to   say   this   because\r\n\r\ntraditionally  Parliament has not  been  concerned\r\n\r\nwith   the   workers'  safety.

Ramaswamy (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, we are very glad to have a Budget for 1971-72\r\n\r\nwithout  any  new  taxes or any  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nexisting  tax  rates. We are also  very  happy  to\r\n\r\nlearn from our Finance Minister that we have had a\r\n\r\nfavourable  year. This is, of course, evidence  of\r\n\r\nour  political  stability, good  leadership,  able\r\n\r\nadministration, honest government, and  confidence\r\n\r\nin  our  future.  We have solved our  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem,  and we are now faced with a shortage  of\r\n\r\nlabour.  We  have heard from our Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government intend to take  measures  to\r\n\r\nmeet  this  problem, and I am sure  this  shortage\r\n\r\nwill also be overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his budget statement our Finance Minister said\r\n\r\nthat  the  domestic  price level  remained  fairly\r\n\r\nstable.  The housing sub-index moved up  by  about\r\n\r\ntwo  percentage points because of a tax levied  on\r\n\r\nPublic Utility Board bills. The Minister said that\r\n\r\nthe  prices  of  rice and other cereals  showed  a\r\n\r\ndecline;  probably so. But we know that the  price\r\n\r\nof  bread  has gone up. So has the price of  sugar\r\n\r\nand  other necessities. The P.U.B, bills have gone\r\n\r\nup because of the increase in the rates of charges\r\n\r\nand  because of the new tax. Bus fares will go  up\r\n\r\nfrom  next  month. There will be no more five-cent\r\n\r\nbus  fare, and no more 25-cent fare from  terminus\r\n\r\nto  terminus.  In sympathy with the  rise  in  bus\r\n\r\nfares,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxi  fares  have  gone  up  too.  The  price   of\r\n\r\nvegetables  has  gone up. The  price  of  imported\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs  has  also gone up. In  short,  if  our\r\n\r\nFinance Minister says that the price index shows a\r\n\r\ndecline, the fact is otherwise. The basic cost  of\r\n\r\nliving has gone up. The lower income group is  the\r\n\r\nlot that suffers most. This is not a healthy sign,\r\n\r\nand  if the Minister agrees with me that it is not\r\n\r\nhealthy, then what measures does he intend to take\r\n\r\nto  counter the increases in the prices  of  basic\r\n\r\nconsumer goods and the rise in the cost of living?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see that the proposed Science Centre is to\r\n\r\nbe  built  at Jurong. As it is, there is  a  heavy\r\n\r\nshortage of land for our industries in Jurong.  If\r\n\r\nthe  University of Singapore is to be  resited  at\r\n\r\nKent  Ridge, why not build the Science  Centre  at\r\n\r\nKent  Ridge  too?  We  can then  have  one  single\r\n\r\nadministration for both institutions and so reduce\r\n\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next I want to speak on the drainage and flood\r\n\r\nalleviation  system. I see that the  drainage  and\r\n\r\nflood  alleviation schemes will cost $4.5  million\r\n\r\nin  the  coming  year. I also see that  the  first\r\n\r\nphase  of the Bukit Timah Flood Alleviation Scheme\r\n\r\nwill  be  completed this year. Several  other  new\r\n\r\ndrainage  systems proposed include Geylang  Serai,\r\n\r\nToa  Payoh and Telok Blangah. Potong Pasir is  one\r\n\r\nof  the worst flood-prone areas. Braddell Road was\r\n\r\nflooded  up  to  10 feet during the December  1969\r\n\r\nflood.  All  the kampong houses were under  water.\r\n\r\nEven now whenever there are two or three inches of\r\n\r\nrain,  the  area is flooded and there are  two  to\r\n\r\nthree  feet  of water. I do not see  Potong  Pasir\r\n\r\nincluded  in any of the flood alleviation schemes.\r\n\r\nDoes  the Toa Payoh scheme include the improvement\r\n\r\nof   the  drainage  of  Sungei  Kallang  and   the\r\n\r\nalleviation  of flood?

I would like to thank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem not only for the kind remarks which have been\r\n\r\naddressed  to  me, but also for the remarks  which\r\n\r\nare critical, though in most cases constructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am embarrassed by the riches - I think there is\r\n\r\na  French  phrase for it: embarras de richesses  -\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been  disclosed  by  the  volume   of\r\n\r\ninformation and comments which have come from  the\r\n\r\nHouse.  If  I  do  not answer  all  the  questions\r\n\r\nraised,  it  is  because, in  reading  through  my\r\n\r\nnotes,  I  have  found  that  some  of  them   are\r\n\r\nindecipherable.  I  shall,  therefore,  take   the\r\n\r\nopportunity of reading the Hansard when  it  comes\r\n\r\nout and give the most thoughtful consideration  to\r\n\r\nall  the suggestions made. I therefore propose  to\r\n\r\nanswer only the main points brought up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think many of the suggestions, questions and\r\n\r\ncriticisms  have  been  answered  by   the   other\r\n\r\nspeakers, so that some of the load has been  taken\r\n\r\noff  me. One of the main points appears to be  the\r\n\r\nrise in the cost of living. I shall deal with this\r\n\r\nin  some detail, and also with the workers and the\r\n\r\nconditions under which they are placed. There  was\r\n\r\nalso  some  comment  on the  protection  of  local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  and the encouragement  of  national\r\n\r\ncapital.  Criticism was levelled at  tourism,  and\r\n\r\nsome   questions  were  raised  on   whether   the\r\n\r\ninvestments which are being made on tourism would,\r\n\r\nin  fact, bring an adequate return. There were, of\r\n\r\ncourse, other general remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the main policy, I sense that there is general\r\n\r\nsupport  although Members have some criticisms  on\r\n\r\nthe  details. For example, I was accused of having\r\n\r\nleft  out  one very important factor. That  factor\r\n\r\nwas  China  and  its effect on the development  of\r\n\r\nthis region. I am, of course, aware that China  is\r\n\r\na  very  powerful country and that it will have  a\r\n\r\nvery considerable effect upon the economies of the\r\n\r\narea.  I  do  not, however, consider that  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  it will play a very great role. As far  as\r\n\r\nSingapore and perhaps Malaysia and other countries\r\n\r\nin  this  region are concerned, I  am  afraid  the\r\n\r\neffect is one of being ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  are not recognised. However, if the Member for\r\n\r\nCrawford has a line to China, we shall be happy to\r\n\r\npursue  the  connections which might  benefit  the\r\n\r\neconomic development of Singapore. I think we  can\r\n\r\npossibly ignore the effect that China has upon the\r\n\r\nprogress  of  Singapore in the  next  one  or  two\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also some criticism by the Member for\r\n\r\nWhampoa  of Mr Okita's criteria for fast economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment. I think he singled out the  criterion\r\n\r\nfor  agricultural development as one which was not\r\n\r\napplicable to Singapore. I am not quite sure  that\r\n\r\nthat   is  so.  Although  we  have  a  very  small\r\n\r\nagricultural  sector, I believe  it  is  a  fairly\r\n\r\nefficient  sector. At one time, we were  exporting\r\n\r\npigs, poultry and eggs until certain barriers were\r\n\r\nplaced  against our exports of these  commodities.\r\n\r\nIf   I  have  not  given  very  much  emphasis  to\r\n\r\nagriculture in my statement, it is not  because  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  consider it very important but because  I\r\n\r\nconsider  its  scope for future expansion  limited\r\n\r\nand,  therefore, it is not one of the most dynamic\r\n\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised certain points about\r\n\r\nagricultural  development. The estimates  do  show\r\n\r\nthat   we   have  given  the  Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  adequate provision for improvement  to\r\n\r\nour   animal   husbandry,   fisheries   and   even\r\n\r\nagriculture of the kind which will be economic.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think there is any land which we can  use\r\n\r\nfor rice cultivation. In this respect, I think  we\r\n\r\nare rather fortunate in not having large areas  in\r\n\r\nwhich  to start the \"green\" revolution. The  price\r\n\r\nof  rice has fallen in spite of what may have been\r\n\r\nsaid  about the cost of living by certain  Members\r\n\r\nof  the  House.  With  the miracle  rice  that  is\r\n\r\navailable for planting in many countries  in  this\r\n\r\nregion which have an economic advantage, the price\r\n\r\nof  rice  is likely to fall further. Beyond  this,\r\n\r\nthe  feeling of the House appears to be  that  the\r\n\r\npolicy  which we have suggested is acceptable  and\r\n\r\nthat the emphasis on export-oriented manufacturing\r\n\r\nis  correct and that we should proceed  with  this\r\n\r\nemphasis on the very dynamic sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now try to deal with the various points of\r\n\r\ncriticisms  by Members. The first is the  rise  in\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of living. I was accused of  dismissing\r\n\r\nthe  rise  in  the cost of living in  a  very  few\r\n\r\nsentences  in  my  report.  This  is  correct.  My\r\n\r\nremarks,  of course, apply to 1970. It is  correct\r\n\r\nthat  the cost of living index for 1970 has  shown\r\n\r\nvery  little  rise  over 1969.  The  prices  which\r\n\r\nMembers have most in their minds today are  really\r\n\r\nconnected  with 1971. For instance, the  price  of\r\n\r\nbread was mentioned; also the price of sugar which\r\n\r\nwas  recently  raised; the rise in bus  fares  and\r\n\r\nperhaps taxi fares - all raised in 1971. I am  not\r\n\r\nsaying  that  this is not important.  It  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.  The two paragraphs in  my  report  are\r\n\r\nrelated  to  1970.  I  did  say  that  in  certain\r\n\r\nrespects there have been increases. In the case of\r\n\r\nhousing,  for example, there has been an  increase\r\n\r\nin  price. But in the case of rice and foodstuffs,\r\n\r\nthere have been some decreases in price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to deal with the nature of the\r\n\r\ncost-of-living index. The cost-of-living index was\r\n\r\nframed in 1960 or thereabouts - quite a long  time\r\n\r\nago  -  so  there  is no question  of  our  having\r\n\r\ndesigned  it - there was some accusation  that  my\r\n\r\nstatisticians perhaps designed it - so that we can\r\n\r\nmislead  the  House as to the actual rise  in  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  living. The basis on which the  cost-of-living  index  was formed, as was rightly  pointed\r\n\r\nout,  is as shown in the Digest of Statistics.  If\r\n\r\nanyone  is  interested, he can see the weights  in\r\n\r\nthe   consumer  price  index.  The  weights   were\r\n\r\ndesigned  so that the basket of goods belonged  to\r\n\r\nthe  workers in 1969 and at that time,  there  was\r\n\r\nconsiderable  unemployment.  The  conditions  then\r\n\r\nwere quite different from what they are today. The\r\n\r\nbasket  of  goods, therefore, consisted mainly  of\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs. Naturally, when you are from the lower\r\n\r\nincome group this is the range of commodities  you\r\n\r\nbuy  most  rather  than  furniture,  T.  V, sets,\r\n\r\nrefrigerators  or  other things which  have  risen\r\n\r\ngreatly   in  prices.  Even  on  this  basis   the\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs  have not really increased  in  prices.\r\n\r\nThe figures are in the Digest of Statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey can easily be compared by anyone who goes  to\r\n\r\nthe  market  place.  Of course,  if  standards  of\r\n\r\nliving have increased, as Members have emphasised,\r\n\r\nit  may be considered whether our present cost-of-living   index  is  really  appropriate   to   the\r\n\r\nconditions  of  today,  in which  case  we  should\r\n\r\nconsider whether we should change the whole system\r\n\r\nand  construct  a  new cost-of-living  index  with\r\n\r\ndifferent weights. If you are one of the  overseas\r\n\r\npersonnel  who come to Singapore, for example,  if\r\n\r\nyou  are  one  of  those who  are  concerned  with\r\n\r\noffshore  oil exploration and you want  to  get  a\r\n\r\nhouse  in  the Tanglin area, you cannot expect  to\r\n\r\npay the same rent that you would pay in 1960. That\r\n\r\nis  quite clear. At the same time, I do not  think\r\n\r\nthat is the criterion on which the Singapore cost-of-living index should be constructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the increase in prices in 1970-71,\r\n\r\nMembers  are  quite rightly concerned  about  what\r\n\r\nshould  be  done.  There was a suggestion  that  a\r\n\r\ncommission of inquiry should be constituted. I  do\r\n\r\nnot   know   whether  this  suggestion  was   made\r\n\r\nseriously. The investigation which has to be  made\r\n\r\nis  really into the basis of the index. As far  as\r\n\r\nthe  prices are concerned, this is a fairly simple\r\n\r\nmatter. It is very easy to get inspectors to go to\r\n\r\nthe  markets  and find out the prices  of  various\r\n\r\ntypes of foodstuffs. In fact, it is being done all\r\n\r\nthe time. If Members are interested in the details\r\n\r\nand which markets sell the cheapest foodstuffs, it\r\n\r\nwill   be   very  easy  to  make  the  information\r\n\r\navailable to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why not publish it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> It will be possible to publish\r\n\r\nit   if  there  is  enough  interest  in  it.  The\r\n\r\ninformation  is  valuable to some extent,  but  in\r\n\r\nmost  cases you will find that the housewives shop\r\n\r\nnear  their homes, it being more costly to take  a\r\n\r\nbus  or  a  taxi  to  do  shopping.  In  practice,\r\n\r\nwhatever  may be the difference in prices between,\r\n\r\nsay, Changi market and Orchard Road market, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  very likely that housewives will go to Changi\r\n\r\nand buy their foodstuffs there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways in which the Government has tried\r\n\r\nto  prevent an increase in the cost of living  has\r\n\r\nbeen  to  ensure  that the social services  remain\r\n\r\nrelatively the same as they were in 1960. I  think\r\n\r\nthe  rents for flats, for example, have not really\r\n\r\ngone  up  in all this time. The standards  of  the\r\n\r\nflats have improved so that if you now live  in  a\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board flat and pay  $20  a\r\n\r\nmonth, I believe that the standards have increased\r\n\r\nso  that  for  $20  you  probably  have  a  higher\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living without an  increase  in  the\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of medical services also remains, to a\r\n\r\ngreat extent, the same. There was mention of  some\r\n\r\ncharge now being made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> A\r\n\r\ntoken charge!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> My colleague says a token\r\n\r\ncharge. In any case, if you are seriously ill, the\r\n\r\ntoken  sum which may be considered more than token\r\n\r\nwould  be  negligible as compared with the  actual\r\n\r\ncost to the Government for providing the services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, the cost of education remains\r\n\r\nrelatively  the same. The number of bursaries  and\r\n\r\nscholarships  has all increased in  number.  There\r\n\r\nagain   the  cost  of  education  has  not  really\r\n\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has, therefore, been some isolation of the\r\n\r\ncitizen  from the increase in the cost  of  living\r\n\r\nover  the last ten years. While it may be  correct\r\n\r\nthat  prices  have  risen to a  great  extent  for\r\n\r\ncertain  sectors of the population,  I  would  say\r\n\r\nthis would be for the higher income group. To  the\r\n\r\nworker  in the same position as in 1960,  I  would\r\n\r\nsay that the increase has not been really all that\r\n\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the position of workers today.\r\n\r\nI  am obliged to Members who have reminded me that\r\n\r\nI  have  not  paid tribute to the  workers  in  my\r\n\r\nbudget statement. I hasten, therefore, to say that\r\n\r\nthe  progress which Singapore has made  would  not\r\n\r\nhave been possible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout  the hard work and self-sacrifice  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers.  Table VA referred to by the  Member  for\r\n\r\nBras Basah, shows a considerable reduction in  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of   man-days  lost  through   industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes. I therefore believe that the trade union\r\n\r\nmovement  has played a very responsible  role  and\r\n\r\nhas  been instrumental in a very large measure  in\r\n\r\nmaking   Singapore   more   attractive   to    the\r\n\r\ninternational  companies  which   have   come   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  industrial peace which  has  been\r\n\r\nmaintained  has been reinforced by  the  restraint\r\n\r\nwhich  the  National  Trades  Union  Congress  has\r\n\r\nexercised in demands for wage increases. This very\r\n\r\nresponsible  attitude will, I hope, meet  with  an\r\n\r\nadequate response from employers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some reference to the matter of\r\n\r\nbonus  payments,  the attitude  of  the  banks  in\r\n\r\nnegotiations  on  bonus payments, and  suggestions\r\n\r\nthat  certain  amendments should be  made  to  the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act. These matters are being considered\r\n\r\nat  present  and it is hoped that some  reasonable\r\n\r\nsolution  will  be found to the whole  problem  of\r\n\r\nwhat should be done in regard to bonus payments as\r\n\r\nagainst an increase in wages. I think it would  be\r\n\r\ndesirable that the effects of the British military\r\n\r\nrun-down  should be gauged before any  adjustments\r\n\r\nare  made  to the present equilibrium between  the\r\n\r\nemployers and the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many considerations in promoting the\r\n\r\neconomic  development of Singapore when suggesting\r\n\r\nthat  bonus  payments should be greatly increased.\r\n\r\nThere   are  certain  countries  which   are   not\r\n\r\naccustomed  to  the idea of bonus payments.  There\r\n\r\nare  others,  like Japan, which  have  made  it  a\r\n\r\npractice  to pay bonuses. These have in  the  past\r\n\r\nbeen  considered  to  be  of  value  in  promoting\r\n\r\nsavings  and in promoting fixed capital  formation\r\n\r\nin  Japan.  At the same time, it may be  advisable\r\n\r\nthat  the practice in Western countries that there\r\n\r\nshould be a relationship of wages to productivity,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  more  direct and  the  yearly  increase\r\n\r\npayment  should be instituted. I believe that  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncouncil, where the employers and the employees get\r\n\r\ntogether  and  settle  what  may  be  a  desirable\r\n\r\nincrease year by year, may be the best solution to\r\n\r\nthe  problem. I hope it will be possible that some\r\n\r\nsolution   to  this  problem  can  be  found   for\r\n\r\nimplementation after the British military  rundown\r\n\r\nwhich will take place this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain Members have emphasised the effects of\r\n\r\nthe  rundown  upon  the workers.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nChangi was very concerned about what could be done\r\n\r\nfor  the  workers in Changi who would  be  greatly\r\n\r\naffected by the run-down in 1971. His concern  was\r\n\r\nthat the conversion to commercial operation of the\r\n\r\nChangi  facilities would not be adequate  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the loss of employment in the area. I  think\r\n\r\nthe successful conversion of Sembawang Dockyard to\r\n\r\ncommercial  operation shows that where  there  are\r\n\r\nskills,  there would be no difficulty in absorbing\r\n\r\nworkers.  If  there  are skilled  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nChangi area who can be absorbed into the aerospace\r\n\r\nindustries,  the Lockheed and the Grumman  Pacific\r\n\r\norganisations  which are trying to develop  repair\r\n\r\nfacilities would take any number of these  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for domestic workers, the problem seems to be\r\n\r\nthat,  from  a general consensus among  employers,\r\n\r\nthere is a shortage of them and that there need be\r\n\r\nno concern about what is going to happen to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real crunch would be for the clerical\r\n\r\nworkers,  the  storekeepers and other white-collar\r\n\r\nworkers  especially if they are of the age  of  40\r\n\r\nand  above  when  it  would be very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nretrain them for industrial jobs. The response  to\r\n\r\nthe  training courses which have been started  for\r\n\r\nthese  workers has been rather poor,  and  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  decided to discontinue the course  specially\r\n\r\narranged for them and to allow them to make use of\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary facilities. This is a very difficult\r\n\r\nproblem  and  I  confess that  it  would  be  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  for us to place redundant  storekeepers\r\n\r\nand  some of the clerical workers, though not  all\r\n\r\nof  them, in industrial employment. I do not think\r\n\r\nthat the suggestion which has been made\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  jobs in the civil service should be reserved\r\n\r\nfor  these workers is feasible. In any case, there\r\n\r\nare  not  enough  storekeeper jobs  in  Government\r\n\r\nservice. In addition, our national servicemen have\r\n\r\nalso  some claim to preferential treatment in  the\r\n\r\nchoice of Government jobs. But we shall do what we\r\n\r\ncan for these workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, until 1969, our concern was to see that\r\n\r\nthere were enough jobs and the conditions did  not\r\n\r\nseem  quite so important. Now that we have reached\r\n\r\nthe   position  of  almost  full  employment,  the\r\n\r\nconditions  of  workers are  quite  rightly  given\r\n\r\ngreater  consideration. In my budget statement,  I\r\n\r\ngave  emphasis  to training. This is  one  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich we can improve the conditions of workers  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can  have an increase to  their  wages\r\n\r\nthrough greater productivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a suggestion by the Member for Moulmein\r\n\r\nthat  it  was not desirable that I should use  the\r\n\r\npayroll  tax for the purpose of giving  incentives\r\n\r\nto  employers for training workers. On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the Member for Whampoa disagreed with  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  My  own  opinion  is  that,  as  this\r\n\r\npayroll  tax  is  collected  in  connection   with\r\n\r\nworkers employed in industry, it is a very  proper\r\n\r\nbasis for using the tax collected to reimburse the\r\n\r\nemployers  who  are creating the skills,  and  who\r\n\r\nmay, after having given a lot of training to their\r\n\r\nemployees, find that they may be lured to  another\r\n\r\nsimilar industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some concern was expressed in connection with the\r\n\r\nsafety   of  workers.  On  this  I  am  in  entire\r\n\r\nagreement that we should increasingly emphasise to\r\n\r\nall  employers that they should implement  schemes\r\n\r\nto  ensure greater safety for their workers. I am,\r\n\r\nhowever,  informed  that  the  workers  themselves\r\n\r\nsometimes  prefer  not to employ safety  measures.\r\n\r\nHelmets are provided for them, but they do not use\r\n\r\nthem.  Guards are provided to prevent the  workers\r\n\r\nfrom  being hurt, but, in some cases, in order  to\r\n\r\nimprove the speed of working, they are removed  by\r\n\r\nthe  workers themselves. This is therefore  not  a\r\n\r\nmatter for the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployers alone to pursue, but also for the\r\n\r\nworkers to be educated.

The Member for Whampoa thought\r\n\r\nthat  we  were over-protecting certain industries.\r\n\r\nIn  my  budget  statement I  made  it  clear  that\r\n\r\nprotection  would be accorded only if  a  case  is\r\n\r\nclearly established. I used the word \"clearly\" and\r\n\r\nI  mean  clearly. I do not mean that any  industry\r\n\r\ncould  call for protection in the early stages  of\r\n\r\nestablishment. In the case of dressed leather -  I\r\n\r\nthink  the  Member  for  Katong  read  some  press\r\n\r\nstatements in connection with it - we have  lifted\r\n\r\nthe  import duty and in many other cases  we  will\r\n\r\nprobably do the same. We do not intend to  protect\r\n\r\nan  inefficient  industry even  where  investments\r\n\r\nhave  been  made either by Government  or  by  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would you like to give way to Dr Tan, Mr Hon?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.

There is a committee  on  tariff\r\n\r\nmatters  in which the Economic Development  Board,\r\n\r\nthe   Trade   Division   and   my   Ministry   are\r\n\r\nrepresented. The committee considers  all  aspects\r\n\r\nof  the  industry.  We will consider  all  aspects\r\n\r\nbefore  making  any  decision.  In  many  of   the\r\n\r\nindustries which are established in Singapore, the\r\n\r\nfailures have been due more to the effect  of  bad\r\n\r\nmanagement  than to lack of markets or  of  proper\r\n\r\nequipment. In some cases, the Development Bank  of\r\n\r\nSingapore tries to save an industry which could be\r\n\r\nviable with good management, and it is proper that\r\n\r\nwe  should  try  to rescue these industries  where\r\n\r\nthere   is  some  possibility  of  their  becoming\r\n\r\nviable.  This  is  the reason  why  we  have  also\r\n\r\npromoted light industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know why the impression has been created\r\n\r\nthat  there  has  been no encouragement  given  to\r\n\r\nlocal  industries.  The Light Industries  Services\r\n\r\nstill remain. The D.B.S, has a fund for lending to\r\n\r\nlight  industries. Its total has run  to  over  $3\r\n\r\nmillion.  I think more money is readily  available\r\n\r\nwhere  applications are made. The impression which\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Crawford has that  we  appear  to\r\n\r\nencourage  foreign industry and give  very  little\r\n\r\nencouragement to our local industries is not quite\r\n\r\ncorrect. I can assure him that if he has any local\r\n\r\nindustry wanting any assistance, we shall give  it -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would you like to give way to Mr Low, Mr Hon?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Yong Nguan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Yong Nguan:</b> Can I clarify, Mr Speaker? I\r\n\r\nthink the impression must have been carried by the\r\n\r\ninterpreter.  Definitely I have not made  such  an\r\n\r\nimplication.  I  only said adequate  encouragement\r\n\r\nshould  be  given in proportion to the  amount  of\r\n\r\nencouragement given to foreign investments. I have\r\n\r\nnot queried the Government's attitude on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> All right. Since the Member for\r\n\r\nCrawford  has  clarified  this,  I  hope  that  my\r\n\r\nstatement  will  be of some use to any  hesitating\r\n\r\nlocal   entrepreneurs.  In  some   respects,   the\r\n\r\nassistance we are prepared to give would be in the\r\n\r\nnature  of  assisting local industries to  produce\r\n\r\nmore  local entrepreneurs. Even on that basis,  we\r\n\r\nwould  be  prepared to go beyond what we might  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  go  with the foreign industries.  We\r\n\r\nwould consider this as part of the process of  the\r\n\r\neducation of local entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the question of tourism. The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Whampoa raised a number of questions.\r\n\r\nHe questioned whether the amount of money which we\r\n\r\nare   going   to  spend  on  tourism  was   really\r\n\r\njustifiable.  There was another Member  who  asked\r\n\r\nabout  the  over-investment which he read  in  the\r\n\r\npress. The estimate which has been made on tourism\r\n\r\nis  that  there would be one million  visitors  in\r\n\r\n1975,  so  that in our development of Sentosa  and\r\n\r\nother  tourist infrastructure, we have taken  this\r\n\r\ninto  account.  I stressed in my budget  statement\r\n\r\nthat,  as  the  amount we would spend  on  Sentosa\r\n\r\nwould  be very large, we would make a very careful\r\n\r\nassessment  of the viability of the  projects  and\r\n\r\nensure  for  ourselves  that  there  would  be  an\r\n\r\nadequate  return  on  the capital  which  will  be\r\n\r\nspent.  I  do  not  think I need  go  beyond  this\r\n\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as over-investment in the tourist industry\r\n\r\nis  concerned,  I think this is a  very  difficult\r\n\r\nquestion. I have said elsewhere that in many cases\r\n\r\nin the past, in Japan, for example, at the time of\r\n\r\nthe  Tokyo Olympics and Expo `70, it was suggested\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  over-investment in  the  tourist\r\n\r\nindustry.  It  was  also said in  connection  with\r\n\r\ninvestment of hotels in Bangkok and Hong Kong.  If\r\n\r\nyou went to Hong Kong, Tokyo or Bangkok, you would\r\n\r\nhave  some  problem in finding hotel accommodation\r\n\r\nin these areas. I myself do not consider that from\r\n\r\nthe  Government point of view there has  been  any\r\n\r\nover-investment in the industry. The  availability\r\n\r\nof accommodation sometimes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstimulates  the  hotel entrepreneur  to  get  more\r\n\r\nbusiness for Singapore, and from the point of view\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister for Finance, this  is  certainly\r\n\r\nvery  desirable.  In  individual  cases  of  hotel\r\n\r\ninvestment,  some entrepreneurs  might  find  that\r\n\r\ntheir  particular hotel is in a district which  is\r\n\r\nnot  very  popular.  In  those  cases,  the  over-investment  is  very obvious. In other  areas,  in\r\n\r\nspite  of  the  number of hotels  that  have  been\r\n\r\nbuilt,  there  may  still be a  need  for  further\r\n\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point which has been made is the effect\r\n\r\nof  urban renewal, the problems created by it, and\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of shop-houses in the areas which  have\r\n\r\nbeen rebuilt. There was also some criticism of the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry,  the  increased  cost   of\r\n\r\nbuilding, and the price of flats, even those built\r\n\r\nby  the  Housing Board. Mention was  made  of  the\r\n\r\nincreased  price  of the Housing  Board  flats  in\r\n\r\nKallang. I think I went into this matter  in  some\r\n\r\ndetail  in my budget statement on the construction\r\n\r\ncosts.  There  is  no question  that  construction\r\n\r\ncosts  have risen. There is also no question  that\r\n\r\nthe  prices  which  are now  being  asked  for  by\r\n\r\nprivate  housing developers are much  higher  than\r\n\r\nwhat  they were even two or three years ago.  This\r\n\r\nis  merely  a symptom of the shortage  of  private\r\n\r\nhousing which has been created by the presence  of\r\n\r\nlarge   numbers  of  people  who  find   Singapore\r\n\r\nattractive as a base for their drilling operations\r\n\r\nin  this  region.  This  phenomenon  may  be  only\r\n\r\ntemporary. At the same time, I recognise that even\r\n\r\nif it is temporary, some hardship is caused to the\r\n\r\nmiddle income group who find the purchase of  even\r\n\r\na  semi-detached unit beyond their means. With  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  housing loan  which  Government\r\n\r\nmight make to civil servants, I think it would  be\r\n\r\nvery difficult for them to pay for a $60,000 unit.\r\n\r\nI  therefore consider that the solution really  is\r\n\r\nin the suggestion which one Member has made, i.e.,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Housing  and Development  Board  should\r\n\r\nbuild flats or units for sale to the middle income\r\n\r\ngroup.  I believe that the present eligibility  is\r\n\r\nlimited  to  a total family income of $1,200,  and\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Member's  suggestion is  to  increase  it  to\r\n\r\n$1,700.  Of course, we will consider it,  but  for\r\n\r\nthe  time being I think $1,500 is an adequate cut-off  point.  In fact, I believe that consideration\r\n\r\nis  already  being given to raising the  limit  to\r\n\r\n$1,500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think that deals with the main points raised by Members in the House. The final point which was made was that all these developments, the growth rate and so on, are really intended for the people of Singapore. Of course, I endorse the feeling that the whole\r\n\r\npurpose  of economic development is to  provide  a\r\n\r\nhigher  standard  of  living  for  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, and that the creation of a more just\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand equal society is the real reason why we\r\n\r\nbelieve in the economic development of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of\r\n\r\nthe Government for the financial year 1st April,\r\n\r\n1971 to 31st March, 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"-[Mr Hon Sui Sen.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Nine minutes to Eight o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1971/19710317/19710317-HA-0300767.pdf\"\">ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE OF SINGAPORE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 1971, TO 31ST MARCH, 1972 (PAPER CMD. 3 OF 1971) (Cols 767-770)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
