The Prime Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"These [tests] will take place during the first\r\n\r\nhalf  of  1957  in a remote part  of  the  Pacific\r\n\r\nOcean. The explosions will take place far from any\r\n\r\ninhabited  islands  and  the  tests  will  be   so\r\n\r\narranged   as  to  avoid  danger  to  persons   or\r\n\r\nproperty. The tests will be high air bursts  which\r\n\r\nwill   not  involve  heavy  fallout.

This\r\n\r\nis my answer. I am satisfied that from the medical\r\n\r\nand  biological point of view that  the  radiation\r\n\r\neffects of this explosion will be insignificant.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on 2nd April, 1957, the Prime Minister said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Provided that the nuclear explosion takes place\r\n\r\nin  areas remote from populated territories and an\r\n\r\nadequate danger area is declared for the period of\r\n\r\nthe  tests,  any localised deposit of radio-active\r\n\r\nmatter  so diffused by the normal dispersal action\r\n\r\nof  currents  and winds as well as by the  natural\r\n\r\ndecay of the bulk of radio-activity emanating from\r\n\r\nthe explosion, any possible danger to human health\r\n\r\nis negligible. Radio-active contamination of fish,\r\n\r\nmarine plants and sea-weed can occur, only in  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  vicinity of the explosion. The  chances\r\n\r\nof any contamination going outside the danger area\r\n\r\nor  continuing after the termination of the danger\r\n\r\nperiod   is  negligible  in  the  case  of   tests\r\n\r\nconducted  by the United Kingdom.

When that  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwas drafted, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nauthorities  in  Singapore  knew  little  of   the\r\n\r\nworkings of such institutions and naturally sought\r\n\r\nexperience  from  other  territories   where   the\r\n\r\nexperience  of  those territories themselves  were\r\n\r\nsetting  up  establishments of the same  kind  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  had  little  to offer.  But  conditions\r\n\r\nelsewhere  were not the same as those in Singapore\r\n\r\nnor  was  it possible to foresee at that time  the\r\n\r\nchanges which only experience of working under the\r\n\r\nterms of the Ordinance would show to be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe  present Ordinance sufficed only to  establish\r\n\r\nthe  Board  of  Governors to enable them  and  the\r\n\r\nBoard  to  plan the buildings and to  recruit  key\r\n\r\nmembers   of   the  staff  but   it   has   become\r\n\r\nincreasingly   apparent   that   amendments    are\r\n\r\nnecessary  if  the  Board is to continue  to  work\r\n\r\nefficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments which this Bill seeks to make are\r\n\r\nlisted  very clearly and simply in the Explanatory\r\n\r\nNote and I think it is unnecessary for me to dwell\r\n\r\nin  detail upon them. I would merely mention that\r\n\r\nthe  work  of  the Board is at present handicapped\r\n\r\nbecause  all  decisions had to be  taken  at  full\r\n\r\nmeetings  of the Board.

This provision is  made\r\n\r\nin  clause 3 of the Bill which by an amendment  to\r\n\r\nsection  5  of  the original Ordinance  gives  the\r\n\r\nBoard  the  power  to make the necessary  by-laws.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.33 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nonly  one  point  I wish to make  regarding  this\r\n\r\nBill.  At  first sight, it would appear  to  be  a\r\n\r\nmatter of detail but if we take similar provisions\r\n\r\nin  the Education Bill into account, it is clearly\r\n\r\na  matter  of  Government policy. I refer  to  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  to  revoke appointments in  paragraphs\r\n\r\n(e) and (f) of clause 2. Paragraph (e) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Chairman and other members appointed by the\r\n\r\nMinister  under  subsection (2)  of  this  section\r\n\r\nshall, unless the Minister shall otherwise direct,\r\n\r\nhold office for a period of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfour   years   and   shall  be   re-eligible   for\r\n\r\nreappointment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that the Minister may at any time\r\n\r\nrevoke such appointment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There  is a similar provision under paragraph  (f)\r\n\r\nfor  persons or bodies appointing members  to  the\r\n\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can see no good reason why appointments\r\n\r\nonce  made  for a period of four years  should  be\r\n\r\nsubject  to  revocation  at  any  time.  Once   an\r\n\r\nappointment  is  made,  the person  so  appointed,\r\n\r\nshould feel that he can settle down and do the job\r\n\r\nof  work for which he has been appointed. It is  a\r\n\r\nsystem  on  which we work in this  House.  However\r\n\r\nmuch  Members  on  this side may regret  that  the\r\n\r\npresent  Government can remain in office for  four\r\n\r\nyears,  the Government is entitled to that  period\r\n\r\nand  we  feel  that  the same sense  of  stability\r\n\r\nshould  be  given to members of the  Board.  I  am\r\n\r\naware that the Explanatory Note 2 (b) states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Amendments to section 4 provide, for appointing\r\n\r\nbodies   to   have  the  power   to   revoke   the\r\n\r\nappointments of members of the Board who have  not\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily represented their interests.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  whether  or not my hon. Friend the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Education   in  the  last  two   years   has\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily  represented the interests  of  his\r\n\r\nelectorate  is  a  matter of  opinion  but  he  is\r\n\r\nentitled  to sit in this House for better  or  for\r\n\r\nworse for a further period of two years. I see  no\r\n\r\nreason why the Chairman of the Board should not be\r\n\r\nequally immune from summary dismissal. The proviso\r\n\r\nimplies  that  if the Chairman does  not  toe  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  line, he could be sacked and  it  also\r\n\r\nimplies  that the Minister has poor confidence  in\r\n\r\nhis  own selection. Furthermore, if there  were  a\r\n\r\ngeneral  election and a change of government,  the\r\n\r\nChairman could be dismissed and replaced  by  some\r\n\r\nfavourite  of the new Minister. The same  argument\r\n\r\napplies  to  the appointments made by the  various\r\n\r\nbodies  and  conditions would  arise  which  could\r\n\r\nseriously  affect  the  smooth  running   of   the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic and an educational institution  should\r\n\r\nbe outside the play of politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are dangerous provisos.

In  the  Seamen's\r\n\r\nRegistry  Board  Bill, which  is  coming  up  very\r\n\r\nshortly - today or tomorrow - to this House, clause  3\r\n\r\n(6) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Chairman and members of the Board shall\r\n\r\nhold  office  for  a period of two  years,  unless\r\n\r\nearlier  removed  by the Minister,  but  shall  be\r\n\r\neligible for re-appointment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  it  is a common practice in most legislation\r\n\r\nthat  you  have this discretionary power given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister and there are reasons - reasons  which\r\n\r\nare broader than what was stated by my hon. Friend\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education: not only a member may\r\n\r\nnot  attend meetings and thereby fail to discharge\r\n\r\nhis duties, but there are other reasons, it may be\r\n\r\nfound  that  a person who is appointed  is  not  a\r\n\r\nsuitable person for that body or that there may be\r\n\r\nreasons  for  which the Minister  thinks  that  he\r\n\r\nshould   be  removed:  there  may  be  allegations\r\n\r\nagainst him which the Minister may think are right\r\n\r\nthat   he   is  favouring  one  side  or   showing\r\n\r\npartiality  or something like that. I  think  that\r\n\r\nthis  discretionary power should be given  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  I  do  not think any  Minister  in  his\r\n\r\nsenses  would ever take advantage of such a clause\r\n\r\nto  manoeuvre persons who are his friends  or  are\r\n\r\nfavourable towards him into such bodies and it has\r\n\r\ncertainly  not been the case with this  Government\r\n\r\nin the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am  astonished  at  the  poverty  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons - I would prefer to say \"excuses\" if  I  may\r\n\r\nbe  permitted - given to support this effort to give\r\n\r\ndictatorial powers to the executive. First, we are\r\n\r\ntold  that  it is in other Ordinances, although  I\r\n\r\nhave  pointed  out  that in the  parent  Ordinance\r\n\r\nproduced  by  colonial officials  passed  in  1954\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  such dictatorial power  to  dismiss\r\n\r\ngiven.

Two wrongs do  not\r\n\r\nmake a right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education gave a reason which sounded very good - that some members do not attend\r\n\r\nmeetings - and  consequently the  Minister  should\r\n\r\nhave  a right to dismiss them because they do  not\r\n\r\ndo  their  work,  completely  forgetting  that  in\r\n\r\nclause 2 (8) of his own Bill, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Any member absenting himself from four\r\n\r\nconsecutive  meetings of the Board without  having\r\n\r\nobtained leave of absence from the Chairman  shall\r\n\r\nbe considered as having resigned from the Board.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Consequently, there is absolutely no  validity  in\r\n\r\nthat  reason  given  by the  Minister  and  it  is\r\n\r\nunfortunate  that the Minister in  charge  of  the\r\n\r\nBill,  who is supposed to know its provisions  and\r\n\r\nto  understand what it is sought to do, should  be\r\n\r\nso  inadequate in his presentation and put  before\r\n\r\nthe House a reason that does not exist on the face\r\n\r\nof the Bill which he himself moves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Commerce and Industry\r\n\r\nsays, \"The executive powers of the Government  are\r\n\r\nnever  abused.\" All power corrupts, Sir,  and  the\r\n\r\nmore  absolute  the power, the more  absolute  the\r\n\r\ncorruption.

The Minister has put forward  the\r\n\r\nidea  that  the  appointee is a  human  being  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  is  subject to human  frailties  but  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the Minister is also as  human.  All\r\n\r\nMinisters are human beings and are as human and if\r\n\r\none  human being can commit one error, I  suggest,\r\n\r\nSir,  that all human beings including the Minister\r\n\r\nwho  makes  the  appointments can also  have  such\r\n\r\nhuman faults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, to point out that Assemblymen\r\n\r\nelected by the people to this Assembly are here to\r\n\r\nstay for their term of office and they may not  be\r\n\r\nremoved even if the voters feel that they are  not\r\n\r\nperforming their jobs. It is up to the Assemblymen\r\n\r\nto  resign and contest a by-election but  that  is\r\n\r\nwithin  their power. Here, Sir, is an  appointment\r\n\r\nto  a  less  important job. All the  same,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant and I think the man appointed should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  facilities to express his  decided  opinion\r\n\r\nand  not  the opinion of the people who  appointed\r\n\r\nhim.  When  I look at this Bill and the  Education\r\n\r\nBill, I come across this power again given to  the\r\n\r\nMinister. This power is unnecessary.

My own anxiety in\r\n\r\nthis   matter   does  derive  largely   from   the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Note number 2 (b) which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Amendments to section 4 provide-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for appointing bodies to have the power to\r\n\r\nrevoke  the  appointments of members  of  the\r\n\r\nBoard who have not satisfactorily represented\r\n\r\ntheir interests.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means, as I understand it, that, as far as\r\n\r\nparagraph (e) is concerned, if the Chairman of the\r\n\r\nBoard   does  not  satisfactorily  represent   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the  Minister,  he  may  have   his\r\n\r\nappointment revoked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I think, Sir, my Friend the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Tanglin   should  be  conscious   that   the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Note in no way limits the  wording  of\r\n\r\nthe  clause,  that  the wording  is  an  absolute,\r\n\r\nunfettered and unchallengeable discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr C.

In dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nproposed proviso which is unacceptable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the Member for Tanglin, I would say this, that\r\n\r\nI am sure all Members of this House will recognise\r\n\r\nthe possibility of a person being appointed to the\r\n\r\nBoard  who  may, for reasons it is  impossible  to\r\n\r\nspecify  precisely in the Bill,  turn  out  to  be\r\n\r\nthoroughly unsuitable. The words proposed in  this\r\n\r\nproviso are to give the Minister powers to get rid\r\n\r\nof  him  (putting it bluntly) and I think  Members\r\n\r\nmust  assume that the Minister will use powers  of\r\n\r\nthat  kind with a full sense of responsibility.  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest to the Member for Tanglin that, as I\r\n\r\nhave  said, since there is a possibility that  the\r\n\r\nperson  may  turn out to be thoroughly unsuitable,\r\n\r\nit may very well be in the public interest that he\r\n\r\nshould  be  removed from the Board.  At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime, it is quite impossible to anticipate, and to\r\n\r\nspecify, in a Bill the precise reasons or the  set\r\n\r\nof   circumstances  which  may  arise  which  will\r\n\r\njustify such a course. I would ask him to consider\r\n\r\nvery  carefully that aspect of the problem, and  I\r\n\r\nam  sure he will see - I hope he will see - the  force\r\n\r\nof the point I am trying to put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> The Attorney-General is too modest,\r\n\r\nSir.

At the same time,  opportunity\r\n\r\nhas  been  taken to introduce a number of changes.\r\n\r\nSome,  for  instance, provide for a more realistic\r\n\r\napproach  to the problem of registering  teachers,\r\n\r\nmanagers and others, and there are also other  in-corporations in the Bill which seek to  strengthen\r\n\r\nit where experience has shown it to be weak. These\r\n\r\nchanges  are  outlined briefly in the  Explanatory\r\n\r\nNote which accompanies the Bill. There are a great\r\n\r\nnumber of these changes. Most of them are of minor\r\n\r\nimportance and I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo not propose to dwell on them in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to speak on the general principles\r\n\r\nof  which  the Bill is an expression and  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  some of the misunderstandings which  comment\r\n\r\nin  the Press on the Bill has shown to exist about\r\n\r\nthe purpose of the Bill as a whole, and especially\r\n\r\nabout  the  more important changes. The  All-Party\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  this  Assembly, hon.  Members  will\r\n\r\nrecollect,  was appointed in 1955 to enquire  into\r\n\r\nthe  causes of the disturbances in certain Chinese\r\n\r\nschools.  That Committee became aware  at  a  very\r\n\r\nearly stage of its enquiry that there was a strong\r\n\r\nfeeling  in  Chinese education  circles  that  the\r\n\r\nRegistration  of  Schools  Ordinance,  1950,   was\r\n\r\ndirected   solely  against  the  Chinese  schools,\r\n\r\nmanagers  and  teachers.  Though  there   was   no\r\n\r\njustification for this suspicion, it was  possible\r\n\r\nto  find  a  cause for this misunderstanding.  For\r\n\r\ncertain perfectly sound reasons, the provisions of\r\n\r\nthat   Ordinance  did  not  apply  to   Government\r\n\r\nschools,  that  is, to schools completely  run  by\r\n\r\nGovernment, controlled by Government, and  staffed\r\n\r\nentirely  by  principals  and  teachers  bound  by\r\n\r\nregulations which controlled their activities,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  much more closely than the Registration  of\r\n\r\nSchools  Ordinance or any regulations  made  under\r\n\r\nit.  But  at  the same time, there  were  then  no\r\n\r\nGovernment  Chinese  schools,  and  though   Malay\r\n\r\nschools  were Government schools, it  came  to  be\r\n\r\nassumed  in  Chinese education  circles  that  the\r\n\r\nterms  \"English schools\" and \"Government  schools\"\r\n\r\nwere synonymous, and that all English schools were\r\n\r\nexempted from the provisions or that Ordinance. It\r\n\r\nwas to remove these possible doubts and suspicions\r\n\r\nthat  the All-Party Committee recommended  that  a\r\n\r\nnew  Ordinance,  if Government were  to  introduce\r\n\r\none,  should apply to all schools. Now  this  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides  for  the  change. All schools - Government\r\n\r\nschools    or    aided    schools    or    private\r\n\r\nschools - whatever  the medium of instruction,  must\r\n\r\nconform  to the conditions laid down in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nand in any regulation made under it. Similarly all\r\n\r\nteachers must be either registered under the  Bill\r\n\r\nor given authority or permission to teach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the Bill is concerned then, it does\r\n\r\nnot matter in the slightest whether a school is  a\r\n\r\nChinese school, a Malay school, a Tamil school, or\r\n\r\nan  English  school, whether  it  teaches  in  the\r\n\r\nmedium  of  Kuo-yu, Malay, Tamil  or  English,  or\r\n\r\nwhether the school is bilingual or trilingual; the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill must apply to all schools,\r\n\r\nit  discriminates against no one. It  is  strictly\r\n\r\nnon-communal and I can assure hon. Members that it\r\n\r\nwill  be  administered quite impartially. The  law\r\n\r\nmust  be  strict,  but  the  application  can   be\r\n\r\ngenerous and lenient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I may say here that in drawing up this Bill\r\n\r\nwe have kept continuously in mind the interests of\r\n\r\none  particular section of the community, and that\r\n\r\nis  the children. The aim throughout has been,  so\r\n\r\nfar  as  possible, to see that they are  given  an\r\n\r\neducation  in  conformity  with  the  Government's\r\n\r\neducation policy to fit them to become responsible\r\n\r\ncitizens  of  the  territory  under  the  care  of\r\n\r\nteachers   with   good   education,   professional\r\n\r\ntraining  and personal integrity, and in  premises\r\n\r\nwhich   conform  to  the  highest  standards   the\r\n\r\ncommunity can reasonably afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that there has been criticism by\r\n\r\nmanagers and teachers of those clauses of the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich refer to them. I have been told -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Ordinance shows no respect to the\r\n\r\nenthusiastic members of the public who  have  made\r\n\r\ngreat  contributions to the culture and  education\r\n\r\nof this country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Another comment says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It contains unreasonable and stringent\r\n\r\nprovisions which reduce the teaching profession to\r\n\r\na  slavish service and show no respect whatever to\r\n\r\nteachers who are assuming heavy responsibilities...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir.

I  have\r\n\r\nalso    personally   received    memoranda    from\r\n\r\neducational bodies in Singapore. These are some of\r\n\r\nthe  quotations  which I am reading.  Yet  another\r\n\r\nquotation says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Ordinance completely impairs the teachers'\r\n\r\nself-respect and prestige and makes them lose  all\r\n\r\nsense of security and confidence in themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are surely ill-considered criticisms by a\r\n\r\nbody of responsible men. I am very well aware  of,\r\n\r\nand  have frequently paid tribute to, the splendid\r\n\r\nand  disinterested work which so many  members  of\r\n\r\nthe   Chinese  community  have  done  for  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools and Chinese education. I am equally  aware\r\n\r\nof  and  I  now pay tribute to the excellent  work\r\n\r\nwhich  so  many teachers have done for many  years\r\n\r\nunder  very difficult conditions in these schools;\r\n\r\nbut  I think hon. Members will agree with me  that\r\n\r\nan Education Bill is not the place to express such\r\n\r\nappreciation, though I am glad to say, as  I  said\r\n\r\njust  now, I will avail myself of this opportunity\r\n\r\nto  pay tribute to them, and I do so here. We  all\r\n\r\nknow  that there have been some - and I am  glad  to\r\n\r\nsay  that there are only a very few - managers whose\r\n\r\ninterest in the pupils has been purely selfish and\r\n\r\nwho have taken advantage of the intense enthusiasm\r\n\r\nof so many parents to give their children a better\r\n\r\neducation than they themselves had, to abuse their\r\n\r\nposition sometimes. Some of the schools have  been\r\n\r\nset  up  in very unhygienic premises. They  packed\r\n\r\nmore  and  more  children into classrooms  already\r\n\r\ngrossly overcrowded, and some school children were\r\n\r\ntaught  by  under-qualified, untrained, overworked\r\n\r\nand   under-paid  teachers,  and  for  all   this,\r\n\r\nexcessive sums in fees have been extorted from the\r\n\r\nchildren. Is it therefore wrong of me to  ask  for\r\n\r\npowers to control the activities of managers  such\r\n\r\nas  these  unscrupulous ones? Is it not reasonable\r\n\r\nfor me to expect not opposition but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport for measures which are designed to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat only honest and responsible people should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  become  or  to  remain  managers   or\r\n\r\nteachers?  Let there be no misunderstanding.  Most\r\n\r\nteachers and managers are responsible - I  said  so\r\n\r\njust   now - but  they  occupy  positions  of   such\r\n\r\nresponsibility  that  not most  but  all - each  and\r\n\r\nevery  one of them - must and should pass the  test.\r\n\r\nThat  is  my  justification for  enforcing  strict\r\n\r\nconditions   before   registering   managers   and\r\n\r\nteachers.  If anyone thinks that these regulations\r\n\r\nand conditions are not necessary, let him think of\r\n\r\nthe  children who have suffered because conditions\r\n\r\nin  the  past were not strict enough or  were  not\r\n\r\nenforced nearly strict enough. Undoubtedly some of\r\n\r\nthe   criticisms  which  come  from  managers  and\r\n\r\nteachers arise from their misunderstanding of  the\r\n\r\npowers  and functions of the Director.  They  have\r\n\r\nassumed  that  the  Director can  act  arbitrarily\r\n\r\naccording to his particular whims and fancies, and\r\n\r\ntherefore  they naturally fear for their security.\r\n\r\nBut  the  Director of Education  is  a  Government\r\n\r\nservant  who  is required always  to  act  in  the\r\n\r\npublic   interests.   He   must   administer   the\r\n\r\nDepartment in accordance with the policy laid down\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister, and you may be  sure  that  any\r\n\r\ndecision  he  takes will be made  only  after  due\r\n\r\nconsideration  of all the available  evidence  and\r\n\r\nafter   discussion  with  all  officers   of   the\r\n\r\nDepartment. That does not mean, of course, that he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  make mistakes, so there is a, provision\r\n\r\nin  the  Ordinance  for persons aggrieved  by  his\r\n\r\ndecision   to  appeal  to  the  newly  constituted\r\n\r\nAppeals Board or to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one of the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on Chinese Education that such an\r\n\r\nAppeals Board should be set up. The Board is to be\r\n\r\na  small one with six members and a Chairman, none\r\n\r\nof  whom  will be officials. Educational interests\r\n\r\nwill be strongly represented with four of the  six\r\n\r\nmembers,  including  two  teachers.  Very  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration  and  thought  were  given  to   the\r\n\r\nquestion  whether  the proceedings  of  the  Board\r\n\r\nshould  be open to the public or not. The decision\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  should  not be open to the public  has  been\r\n\r\ncriticised   as  contrary  to  normal   democratic\r\n\r\nprinciples  and  practice,  which  requires   that\r\n\r\njustice should not only be done but be seen to  be\r\n\r\ndone. In theory, that criticism may be valid,  but\r\n\r\nthe  decisions which the Board will have  to  take\r\n\r\nare   not  concerned  with  rightful  or  wrongful\r\n\r\nconvictions of offences against the Criminal Code.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be  for  them to decide,  for  instance,\r\n\r\nwhether  or not the Director was right in deciding\r\n\r\nthat a school in some way failed to comply with or\r\n\r\nsatisfied  the  conditions  which  the  Department\r\n\r\nrequires  or that the manager or teacher  for  one\r\n\r\nreason or another is not a suitable person to have\r\n\r\ncharge  of the education of children. In my  view,\r\n\r\nthe  Board will be the better able to arrive at  a\r\n\r\njust decision if it can consider the appeals in an\r\n\r\natmosphere  free from the impact of political  and\r\n\r\nemotional  propaganda. The members  of  the  Board\r\n\r\nwill, in fact, have a difficult enough task if the\r\n\r\nproceedings are not public. Experience  has  shown\r\n\r\nthat  the  task becomes impossible if the meetings\r\n\r\nare  allowed to be used as occasions for political\r\n\r\nor  communal propaganda. The Board will not in any\r\n\r\nsense  be  an  official one. It is only  right  to\r\n\r\nleave  them  to hear appeals in peace and  at  the\r\n\r\nsame    time   to   avoid   giving   any   further\r\n\r\nembarrassment  to  persons whose  appeals  may  be\r\n\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for appeals against\r\n\r\ncertain decisions of the Director to be heard  not\r\n\r\nby  the  Appeals Board but by the Minister.  These\r\n\r\nare   appeals  against  decisions  which   involve\r\n\r\nconsiderations of public security. It is the  view\r\n\r\nof  the  Government that, while it  is  proper  to\r\n\r\ndelegate  power  to  the  Director  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nquestions of purely educational content, it is not\r\n\r\nproper  to  delegate that power where  the  public\r\n\r\nsecurity  is  concerned. The Minister's  power  is\r\n\r\nafter all the Government's power. It has been said\r\n\r\nthat  it is undemocratic that the Minister  should\r\n\r\nhear such appeals, but I say that it is democratic\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister should be responsible for  such\r\n\r\nmatters and that he himself is responsible to this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other important changes recommended\r\n\r\nby  the All-Party Committee was that both the  old\r\n\r\nOrdinances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-the  Registration  of Schools Ordinance  and  the\r\n\r\nEducation  Ordinance - should be embodied  into  one\r\n\r\nOrdinance. This has now been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill not only provides for the registration\r\n\r\nof  schools,  managers and teachers but  also  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of an Educational Finance Board and  an\r\n\r\nEducational  Advisory  Council  (the  latter   was\r\n\r\nrecommended by the All-Party Committee).  The  new\r\n\r\nEducational Finance Board is in most respects very\r\n\r\nlike  the  old  one, but there  is  one  important\r\n\r\ndifference.  The new Board will be advisory  only.\r\n\r\nIt will make recommendations to the Minister about\r\n\r\nthe  money  needed  for education  and  will  also\r\n\r\nadvise  him  on the administration of  this  money\r\n\r\nwhen  it  is  provided, but it will not  have  the\r\n\r\nauthority to decide what money is to be  spent  or\r\n\r\nhow it is to be spent. That responsibility must be\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's  who,  in  turn,  as  I  say,   is\r\n\r\nresponsible to this Assembly. This will involve  a\r\n\r\nchange in the annual Estimates. The Estimates  now\r\n\r\nappearing  under  the  Head  Education   and   the\r\n\r\nAppendix    under   the   Head   Education - Finance\r\n\r\nBoard - will  in  future  be incorporated  into  the\r\n\r\nordinary departmental Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been suggested that the Finance Board\r\n\r\nshould  contain representatives of  all  the  four\r\n\r\nmain  communities. I do not think it is necessary.\r\n\r\nThere   is  already  too  much  talk  of  communal\r\n\r\ninterests.  It will be the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister, and in the last resort of this Assembly,\r\n\r\nto  see that all are given a fair deal; and in any\r\n\r\ncase  it  is  most  churlish, in  my  opinion,  to\r\n\r\nsuggest that we cannot find four men of sufficient\r\n\r\nstanding,   integrity  and  authority,   who   are\r\n\r\nsufficiently  free  from  communal  prejudice,  to\r\n\r\nrecommend a just allocation of the funds available\r\n\r\nfor education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Council replaces the old Education\r\n\r\nCommittee.  It  is  a much larger  body  than  the\r\n\r\nEducation Finance Board and therefore here  it  is\r\n\r\neasier  to  arrange for the different  communities\r\n\r\nand    educational   interests   to   be    fairly\r\n\r\nrepresented.  Here  it  has also  been  criticised\r\n\r\nbecause  its membership is not wholly  drawn  from\r\n\r\neducational circles; but again in my opinion  that\r\n\r\ncriticism\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  ill-considered.  It is not  only  teachers  or\r\n\r\nmanagers  and  the  like who  are  concerned  with\r\n\r\neducational problems. Education touches every  one\r\n\r\nof  us. We need on this Advisory Council not  only\r\n\r\neducationists but also men of authority  and  wide\r\n\r\nexperience  who  can  look at education  from  the\r\n\r\noutside;  otherwise  there  is  that  danger  that\r\n\r\neducation  for  education's sake will  become  too\r\n\r\ningrown  and that in our concern about the  means,\r\n\r\nwe  shall lose sight of the ends. So provision has\r\n\r\nbeen made in the Bill that the Council should have\r\n\r\na  strong  leavening of members with  no  specific\r\n\r\neducational  qualifications or interests.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Council will be an extremely valuable means of\r\n\r\nkeeping in touch with the views of the public  and\r\n\r\nthe   community  at  large,  whether  on   matters\r\n\r\nreferred  to  it by the Ministry or matters  which\r\n\r\nthe Council itself might bring up to the notice of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have touched on the most important\r\n\r\nfeatures  of  the Bill, and I hope I have  removed\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  causes  of  the  misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nBefore I move, Sir, may I emphasise once more what\r\n\r\nI have said at the beginning:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that this Bill is strictly non-communal\r\n\r\nand  that  it  is  quite untrue  to  say  that  it\r\n\r\ndiscriminates  against  any  particular  group  or\r\n\r\nschools or community or teachers; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that the over-riding purpose of this\r\n\r\nBill  is  to protect the interests of the children\r\n\r\nwithout  whom  there  would be  no  necessity  for\r\n\r\nproviding schools or teachers or managers  or  any\r\n\r\nneed for this Bill at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>12 noon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  as  one  who  is  not affected  by  communal\r\n\r\nmatters, I would like to say that, having  studied\r\n\r\nthis  Bill over two evenings, I am satisfied  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister does in fact speak the truth when  he\r\n\r\nsays   that  it  is  an  attempt  at  non-communal\r\n\r\nunification  of our educational system.

I\r\n\r\nthink  they  recognise that that White  Paper  put\r\n\r\nforth  principles which they desire themselves  to\r\n\r\nsee  put  into concrete form in legislation.  They\r\n\r\nare  ready, they are anxious for legislation which\r\n\r\nembodies  the principles of that White Paper,  and\r\n\r\nsome  of those principles are in fact embodied  in\r\n\r\nthis  Bill. But there is so much not in the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  but in this Bill that it destroys the value\r\n\r\nof  the Bill, Sir, and the theme of this my speech\r\n\r\nis  not so much to attack the Bill as to hope that\r\n\r\nGovernment, after considering the views  expressed\r\n\r\nin this House, will take time to reconsider before\r\n\r\nseeking to force through this measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have known the Minister for Education for\r\n\r\nsome  time  and  I  trust he will  take  it  as  a\r\n\r\ncompliment if I say this - that probably he  is  not\r\n\r\nfully  aware of what this Education Bill contains,\r\n\r\nbecause to me, Sir, this Bill is drafted, or seems\r\n\r\nto   be  drafted,  on  the  assumption  that  this\r\n\r\nAssembly consists of blind chickens, that  we  can\r\n\r\nneither  read  nor understand legal English.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe Straits Times has depicted me as a hen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naddling  the  Easter egg, but at  least  it  never\r\n\r\ndepicted me blind. It gave me open eyes, and  open\r\n\r\neyes I have. Of all the Bills or Ordinances I have\r\n\r\never  seen,  this  Bill,  Sir,  is  unique  in  my\r\n\r\nexperience, absolutely unique, in the breadth  and\r\n\r\nthe  extent  of  the dictatorial powers  which  it\r\n\r\ngives  to  one  man. If there  were  a  museum  of\r\n\r\ncolonial  exhibits, I would put this Bill  Exhibit\r\n\r\nA,  Sir, Exhibit A. Educational matters, Sir,  are\r\n\r\nnot  specifically my line. I have never sought  to\r\n\r\ninterfere, particularly the administration of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,   despite  the  bitter  words   of   the\r\n\r\nMinister,  but I thought it my duty the  last  two\r\n\r\nevenings  to look at this Bill, and I am going  to\r\n\r\nsubmit to this House that there are defects  of  a\r\n\r\ngrave   character  which  require   very   earnest\r\n\r\nconsideration   and   which   require   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  withdraw  it  for  some   time\r\n\r\ndespite  the  urgency in order to  reconsider  its\r\n\r\nposition.  Sir,  I  was, am, and  will  be,  as  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative of the people, anxious  to  receive\r\n\r\nrepresentations from associations  which  seek  to\r\n\r\nmake  their points of view heard. I have not  been\r\n\r\napproached by anybody until this morning - by one at\r\n\r\n9.30,  by another at 9.50. At 9.30 a.m. I received\r\n\r\na  memorandum from the English Teachers of Chinese\r\n\r\nSchools' Union, and frankly, on a cursory reading,\r\n\r\nthere  seems  to be some sense in  many  of  their\r\n\r\nobjections. I have also received a memorandum from\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Chinese Schools Committee  Teachers\r\n\r\nAssociation in the Chinese language. It looks very\r\n\r\nimposing, Sir, and very impressive but it  is  not\r\n\r\nfollowed  by any translation and I am  unhappy  at\r\n\r\nbeing  unable  to know how I can be of  assistance\r\n\r\nafter  reading it. But placed in the  position  of\r\n\r\nnot   being  able  to  study  the  representations\r\n\r\nreceived,  I can only indicate to this  House  the\r\n\r\ndefects  which exist in my view after a  study  of\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to take the Educational Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil  appointed by clause 5. You will see  from\r\n\r\nthere,   Sir,   that  there  is  an  extraordinary\r\n\r\npreponderance of official appointments.  There  is\r\n\r\nthe Director of Education, the Permanent Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the Treasury, the Medical Officer in charge of\r\n\r\nschools, the Director\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Social Welfare, ten persons appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister at his discretion - ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Clause 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Clauses 5 (2) and 8 (2) (f).\r\n\r\nClause  5 (2) provides for four and clause  8  (2)\r\n\r\n(f)  provides  for  six. If  it  please  you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  would  like  to  explain  it  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister   in  very  simple  language.  Clause   5\r\n\r\nappoints  the  Finance Board. Clause  8  says  the\r\n\r\nwhole  Finance  Board comes into  the  Educational\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Council. So the four people he  appoints\r\n\r\nunder  clause  5  of the Finance Board  become  an\r\n\r\nadditional four to the people he appoints  to  the\r\n\r\nEducational  Advisory  Council.  If  that  is  too\r\n\r\ndifficult, the Attorney-General will correct me if\r\n\r\nI am wrong. Let me go back, Sir. I think four plus\r\n\r\nsix  makes ten. So under clauses 5 (2) and  8  (2)\r\n\r\n(f),  the  Minister appoints ten  persons  at  his\r\n\r\ndiscretion.  A  total  of  14  appointed  by   the\r\n\r\nMinister - four officials and ten nominated by  him.\r\n\r\nAs  against  that,  Sir, there are  eight  persons\r\n\r\nnominated  by educational bodies, the  educational\r\n\r\nbodies  themselves being institutions approved  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister. Sir, it is a heavy preponderance  of\r\n\r\nofficials and members appointed by Government, and\r\n\r\nit is to be noted that here, as in the Polytechnic\r\n\r\nBill, these persons appointed by the Minister  can\r\n\r\nbe removed at his pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we leave for a moment the Educational\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Council and come to the Schools  Appeals\r\n\r\nBoard.  It  is rather important to look  at  these\r\n\r\nthings, to notice the preponderance of persons who\r\n\r\nare  officially persona grata. The Chairman  under\r\n\r\nclause 12 is appointed by the Minister. There  are\r\n\r\ntwo registered teachers appointed by the Minister.\r\n\r\nThere are two other persons - not teachers, brokers,\r\n\r\nmerchants,   Income   Tax  employees,   what   you\r\n\r\nwill - appointed by the Minister. So  you  have  got\r\n\r\nfive  persons - five - appointed at the discretion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister; and there are two persons nominated\r\n\r\nby  educational  bodies who are  approved  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  But  at  least they  are  nominated  by\r\n\r\noutsiders. So you have got - and keep this  in  mind\r\n\r\nwhen  we  come to consider the powers - an official\r\n\r\npreponderance of five to two\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the Schools Appeals Board. Now, Sir, what  are\r\n\r\nthe  powers of the Schools Appeals Board?  Let  us\r\n\r\nlook at clause 14 which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It shall be the duty of the Appeals Board to\r\n\r\nhear and decide all appeals from the decisions-\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now  whether \"decisions\" include orders is  rather\r\n\r\nan interesting point. I continue, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"-of the Director other than those expressly\r\n\r\nexcepted under paragraph (a) of subsection (2)  of\r\n\r\nsection 48 of this Ordinance:\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us go chasing round, if you do not\r\n\r\nmind - I  know it is a bore to follow paragraph  (a)\r\n\r\nof  subsection  (2)  of section  48:  nobody  ever\r\n\r\nbothered - but let us chase round and find out what\r\n\r\nthis  \"expressly excepted\" means. Let us  turn  to\r\n\r\nclause 48. Sub-clause (2) (a) of clause 48 says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"in cases where the refusal is under paragraphs\r\n\r\n(o), (p) and (q) of section 24, paragraph (f)  of\r\n\r\nsection 25, paragraph (i) of section 33, paragraph\r\n\r\n(g) of section 34, or paragraph (g) of section 38...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Of  course, we could not say all that in the first\r\n\r\none.  In  fact, in clause 14 it looks very  simple\r\n\r\nexcept  with  the one exception, but now  we  find\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  in fact seven exceptions.  Seven\r\n\r\nexceptions where the Schools Appeals Board has  no\r\n\r\npower  to hear appeals, and where the appeals  are\r\n\r\nonly to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the period when I was dictator,\r\n\r\naccording to my friends and former colleagues  who\r\n\r\nat  the time enjoyed their posts without demur,  I\r\n\r\nlearned one thing if I learned nothing at all, and\r\n\r\nthat  is,  a Minister is not in fact organised  to\r\n\r\nhear  appeals, to be able to gather facts  and  to\r\n\r\nsit in judgment quietly in order to do justice  on\r\n\r\na difficult matter. He just is not organised. Your\r\n\r\nMinisters - pity them! - have (if they work and  most\r\n\r\nof  them  work) a great deal to do. Their time  is\r\n\r\ncut up into little bits of appointments and little\r\n\r\nbits  of other things. They just are not organised\r\n\r\nand  can  never be organised into a true Court  of\r\n\r\nAppeal   which   can  quietly   and   calmly   and\r\n\r\nimpartially  examine  appeals  from  decisions  of\r\n\r\ntheir own Ministry. For let us recognise this - that\r\n\r\nif you do not co-operate with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyour  Permanent  Secretary, you  come  in  for  an\r\n\r\nawfully difficult time.

A Minister can, a Minister\r\n\r\nsometimes even does go against the advice  of  his\r\n\r\nofficials  in  the Ministry, but let us  recognise\r\n\r\nthe  fact that it makes life impossible if you are\r\n\r\ngoing  to  question  every  single  act  of   your\r\n\r\npermanent officials.

This power of appeal  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nthese  seven  clauses to the  Minister  is  purely\r\n\r\nnominal.  Now  what are these seven  classes?

These  seven  doors,  Sir,  are  where  the\r\n\r\ndictator of education has his big guns to  enforce\r\n\r\nhis  absolute will on all educationalists  subject\r\n\r\nonly  to an appeal to his boss the Minister.  Now,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  have pointed out that where there  is  no\r\n\r\nAppeals Board at all, an appeal to the Minister is\r\n\r\nbetter than nothing though in truth and in fact it\r\n\r\nusually is a pure formality but here there  is  an\r\n\r\nAppeals Board. There is an Appeals Board of seven,\r\n\r\nfive of whom are specifically picked and chosen by\r\n\r\nthe Minister himself: five to two preponderance of\r\n\r\nthose  who are persona grata to the Minister.  Why\r\n\r\nthen,  Sir, can this Appeals Board not be  trusted\r\n\r\nwith  the  matters coming under the seven  classes\r\n\r\nexempted  under the provisions of clauses  14  and\r\n\r\n48? Let us look at them, Sir. I will take them  in\r\n\r\norder. It says that clause 24 (o), (p) and (q)  is\r\n\r\nnot  subject to appeal to the Appeals  Board.  Now\r\n\r\nclause 24 on page 11 of the Bill reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may refuse to register a school if\r\n\r\nit shall appear...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(o) the proposed school is likely to be used\r\n\r\nfor  a  purpose detrimental to the interests\r\n\r\nof the Colony or of the public;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  do  not know whether \"interests of the  Colony\"\r\n\r\nare  identical with the fact of being a colony  or\r\n\r\nthe  Colonial Office's interests but let us assume\r\n\r\nfor  a moment that the words are legitimately used\r\n\r\nas  interests  of this territory  and  the  people\r\n\r\ntherein.  Notice how extremely wide  that  wording\r\n\r\nis, Sir:  if it appears to the Director that  the\r\n\r\nproposed school is likely to be used for a purpose\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the interests of the Colony  or  of\r\n\r\nthe  public.  You  could not possibly  find  wider\r\n\r\nwords. Look at the next one:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(p) the proposed school is likely to be used\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose of instruction detrimental\r\n\r\nto  the  interests of the public or  of  the\r\n\r\npupils;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I do not know what difference there is. Then:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(q) the proposed school is likely to he used\r\n\r\nas a meeting place of an unlawful society;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then we go to clause 25, Sir. Clause 25 (f) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may cancel the registration of any\r\n\r\nschool-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) if it appears to him that discipline in the\r\n\r\nschool  has not been or cannot be adequately\r\n\r\nmaintained.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Here  again, although the Appeals Board is  surely\r\n\r\nan   organization  far  better  suited  than   the\r\n\r\nMinister to understand what educational discipline\r\n\r\nis,  no, the Appeals Board cannot be trusted  with\r\n\r\nan  appeal  from  a  decision  of  so  serious   a\r\n\r\ncharacter  as  to  cancel the  registration  of  a\r\n\r\nschool on the ground that \"it appears to him  (the\r\n\r\nDirector)  that discipline in the school  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen or cannot be adequately maintained.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then let us take clause 33 (i). I am sorry, Sir,\r\n\r\nif  I  seem  to be going into details.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nseeking  to amend them at this stage.  What  I  am\r\n\r\nseeking  is  that this House should  realise  that\r\n\r\nthis   Bill   is,  in  fact,  a   Bill   for   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of a dictator of education  and  to\r\n\r\nthat  extent it is entirely unacceptable to  those\r\n\r\nwho  accept, shall we say, the popular phrase, the\r\n\r\ndemocratic principle that, in fact, this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nundemocratic. Now, Sir, let us take clause 33  (i)\r\n\r\nwhich reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may in his discretion refuse to\r\n\r\nregister any person as a manager of a school if-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) it appears to the Director that it will be\r\n\r\nprejudicial to the interests of  the  Colony\r\n\r\nor  of  the public or of the pupils  of  the\r\n\r\nschool  that  such  person  should   be   so\r\n\r\nregistered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>How  wide, how much wider is it possible to  frame\r\n\r\nany clause giving absolute powers! Let us go on to\r\n\r\nclause 34 (g) which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may cancel the registration of any\r\n\r\nmanager-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) if after the date of his registration it\r\n\r\nappears to the Director that he is a  person\r\n\r\nwho ought not in the interests of the Colony\r\n\r\nor  of  the public or of the pupils  of  the\r\n\r\nschool to remain a manager.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Finally,  clause 38(g) -finally, I  say.  Sir - I  am\r\n\r\nmerely  talking  of  the seven main  doors.  After\r\n\r\nthese seven, Sir, there are 27 areas of discretion\r\n\r\nbut these are the main doors. Clause 38 (g) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may refuse to register a person as\r\n\r\na  teacher  if  it  appears to  him  that  the\r\n\r\napplicant-\r\n\r\n\r\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) is likely to influence his pupils in a\r\n\r\nmanner  prejudicial to their  welfare  or  to\r\n\r\nthe public interest;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1539</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I say, Sir, that the exception in clause 14\r\n\r\nmakes a complete farce of the Appeals Board,  that\r\n\r\nin   fact,  those  exceptions  give  the  Director\r\n\r\nabsolute  power  to  refuse  to  register  schools\r\n\r\n(clause  24), to cancel registration of  a  school\r\n\r\n(clause 25), to refuse to register the manager  of\r\n\r\na  school (clause 33), to cancel registration of a\r\n\r\nmanager (clause 34) and to refuse registration  of\r\n\r\na  teacher (clause 38). In truth and in fact, this\r\n\r\nexception  means there is no protection whatsoever\r\n\r\nfor educationalists against the arbitrary exercise\r\n\r\nof dictatorial executive powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have said before that the Minister in\r\n\r\ncharge of this Bill does not fully understand  its\r\n\r\nprovisions but I here and now, Sir, challenge  the\r\n\r\nHon. the  Attorney-General to tell  you  that  my\r\n\r\nstatement is incorrect, that in truth and in  fact\r\n\r\nthere  is  absolute  power  in  the  Director   of\r\n\r\nEducation as the right-hand man of the Minister to\r\n\r\nrefuse   to   register   a  school - absolute   and\r\n\r\nunchallengeable - to cancel registration, to  refuse\r\n\r\nto register a manager, to cancel registration of a\r\n\r\nmanager  and to refuse registration of a  teacher.\r\n\r\nThose   are  the  seven  main  doors  of  control - absolute  and  dictatorial - but they are  not  all,\r\n\r\nSir.  Throughout this Bill, there are 27 areas  of\r\n\r\ndiscretion,  in addition to these seven  given  to\r\n\r\nthe  Director  and  they  are  divided  into  four\r\n\r\nclasses. One, the phrase \"in his discretion\". That\r\n\r\nphrase  is  used seven times. Two,  \"if  it  shall\r\n\r\nappear  to him\" and that phrase is used 13  times.\r\n\r\nThree, \"he has powers if in his opinion\" and  that\r\n\r\nis  used four times. Finally, \"he has powers if he\r\n\r\nis  satisfied\"  and that is used  three  times,  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of 27 areas of discretion. Now let  us  see\r\n\r\nwhat  this means. I do not intend to pull the wool\r\n\r\nover anybody's eyes in these matters. I would like\r\n\r\nyou  to  see  exactly what it means. Let  us  take\r\n\r\nclass  one \"in his discretion\" and let us turn  to\r\n\r\none  of the items to which it refers and I ask you\r\n\r\nto look at clause 22(2) which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"An application for the registration of a school [that\r\n\r\nis important enough, you think]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1540</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  than a Government school shall be  made  to\r\n\r\nthe  Director by a person intending  to  become  a\r\n\r\nmanager of the school and the Director may in  his\r\n\r\ndiscretion grant such application subject to  such\r\n\r\nconditions,  if any, as he may think  fit  or  may\r\n\r\nrefuse such application.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>There  is  no right of appeal whatever  either  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the conditions or in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nrefusal to register the school because it  is  \"in\r\n\r\nhis  discretion\" - this colossus.  Let  us  look  at\r\n\r\nclass  number two \"if it shall appear to him\".  It\r\n\r\nis  handy. Let us look at clause 24. Take  any  of\r\n\r\nthe  paragraphs (a) to (s) : I do not know how many\r\n\r\nthey  make.  Let us take the first  paragraph  (a)\r\n\r\nwhich reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may refuse to register a school if\r\n\r\nit shall appear to him that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) adequate educational facilities already\r\n\r\nexist in the area in which it is proposed to\r\n\r\nopen the school;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  you  will notice not that the  Director  may\r\n\r\nrefuse  to register a school it adequate education\r\n\r\nfacilities  already exist but  he  may  refuse  to\r\n\r\nregister  a school if it appears to him.  So  when\r\n\r\nyou  appeal against his decision, you have got  to\r\n\r\ngo  before the Appeals Board not to prove that  in\r\n\r\nfact  the  decision is unreasonable but you  have\r\n\r\ngot  to  prove  that  it did not  appear  to  him.\r\n\r\nOtherwise what is the meaning of that phrase?  Why\r\n\r\nput  it  in  there? \"The Director  may  refuse  to\r\n\r\nregister   a   school   if  adequate   educational\r\n\r\nfacilities already exist.\" That is fair enough. He\r\n\r\nmay  refuse,  you  appeal,  you  prove  there  are\r\n\r\nadequate educational facilities and that,  in  the\r\n\r\nnormal course, the Director was wrong and you win.\r\n\r\nBut  no,  no,  Sir,  the Director  may  refuse  to\r\n\r\nregister  a  school  not if  adequate  educational\r\n\r\nfacilities  exist but if it appears  to  him  (His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the Dictator) and you must  take  into\r\n\r\naccount  his personal idiosyncrasies,  not  if  it\r\n\r\nappears  to  the common man but if it  appears  to\r\n\r\nhim.  All  he has to say when he comes before  the\r\n\r\nAppeals Board is, \"It appears to me. Now, you call\r\n\r\nme a liar. Are you going to prove me a liar?\" Take\r\n\r\nanother one, take any of these paragraphs.  Clause\r\n\r\n24(c) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1541</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may refuse to register a school if\r\n\r\nit shall appear to him that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the fire precautions in the proposed school\r\n\r\npremises   are   or   are   likely   to   be\r\n\r\ninadequate;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  for instance, you can call the fire brigade,\r\n\r\nyou can call every fireman in town to prove to the\r\n\r\nAppeals  Board that the fire precautions  are,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  adequate  but  if the  Director  says,  \"It\r\n\r\nappears  to  me  that these are inadequate,\"  then\r\n\r\nwhere  is your appeal? If it means the same thing,\r\n\r\nwhy do you put the words \"if it appears to him\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Let\r\n\r\nus  take  class three. I do want to  satisfy  you.\r\n\r\nSir,  that,  in fact, these discretionary  clauses\r\n\r\nare  complete and absolute discretion  and  though\r\n\r\nthere  is supposed to be an appeal, in fact, there\r\n\r\ncan   be  no  appeal  from  the  exercise   of   a\r\n\r\ndiscretion. Class three where the phrase  \"in  his\r\n\r\nopinion\" is used. Let us take any one. Let us take\r\n\r\nclause 34 (g) which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may cancel the registration of any\r\n\r\nmanager-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) if after the date of his registration it\r\n\r\nappears to the Director that he is a  person\r\n\r\nwho ought not in the interests of the Colony\r\n\r\nor  of  the public or of the pupils  of  the\r\n\r\nschool to remain a manager.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,  how  do  you appeal? You go to  the  Appeals\r\n\r\nBoard  and you say, \"Well, look, there is  nothing\r\n\r\nwrong with me except I belong to the Party Ra'ayat\r\n\r\nor I belong to the P.A.P. although they are now in\r\n\r\nfavour but-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> In favour of\r\n\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> In favour of the Government. Let\r\n\r\nus  say  that  you  go along and appeal.  All  the\r\n\r\nAppeals Board can say is, \"Look, we are sorry. The\r\n\r\nDirector may cancel the registration of a manager,\r\n\r\nnot  if the manager is a person who ought not,  in\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the Colony, to be a manager, but\r\n\r\nthe manager is a person who 'in the opinion of the\r\n\r\nDirector' is not a person\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1542</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho ought to be and the Director tells us that  in\r\n\r\nhis  opinion  he  ought not to be a  manager.\"  We\r\n\r\ncannot legally overrule him because it is a matter\r\n\r\nfor the opinion of the Director. I want you to see\r\n\r\nanother one, clause 39 (b). This is rather neat:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may cancel the registration of a\r\n\r\nteacher-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if it appears to the Director that the\r\n\r\nteacher  has  been  guilty  of  professional\r\n\r\nmisconduct;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Not,   if   the   teacher  has  been   guilty   of\r\n\r\nprofessional  misconduct. After all,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nSchools  Appeals Board. The Minister has told  you\r\n\r\nthat  there  are four teachers on this  Board  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  you  can  expect them  to  enforce  the\r\n\r\nappropriate discipline. That is fine but  yet  you\r\n\r\nare not allowing him to go. I mean here that it is\r\n\r\nnot  the Board that will decide whether there  has\r\n\r\nbeen professional misconduct if it appears to  the\r\n\r\nDirector  that  the  teacher has  been  guilty  of\r\n\r\nprofessional misconduct. So you go and  appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Board  and all the Board can say.  \"Well,  it\r\n\r\nappears  to the Director. How do we interfere?  He\r\n\r\nhas  got the discretion under clause 39 (b).\"  Or,\r\n\r\n\"Under  clause 39 (b), it appears to the  Director\r\n\r\nthat he is not competent to perform the duties for\r\n\r\nwhich  he is employed.\" If it is the Director  who\r\n\r\ndecides,  what  is the value of an appeal  from  a\r\n\r\ndiscretion except to be thrown out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the last class where the wording is\r\n\r\n\"he  may  do an act if he is satisfied\". Ah,  now,\r\n\r\nhow  do  we satisfy this dictator? Let us look  at\r\n\r\nclause 37 which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Subject to the provisions of section 38 of this\r\n\r\nOrdinance . . . , and after such enquiry as he may\r\n\r\nthink  necessary the Director shall  if  satisfied\r\n\r\nregister the applicant [that is, the teacher].\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, the applicant appeals and says, \"Look, I have\r\n\r\nbeen  wrongly refused registration. What  can  the\r\n\r\nAppeals  Board do?\" It says, \"Clause  37  provides\r\n\r\nthat  the Director must be satisfied. The Director\r\n\r\nsays that he is not satisfied.\" And so he goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these dictatorial powers under clause 14\r\n\r\nand under these minor clauses of discretion are of\r\n\r\na character which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1543</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmake  of  the  Minister through  the  Director  of\r\n\r\nEducation a complete and absolute dictator in  all\r\n\r\nmatters educational. Now, I would like to make  it\r\n\r\nclear  that I support much of this Bill but  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  prepared to support now or at any future time\r\n\r\ndictatorial powers to the executive when they  are\r\n\r\ncompletely unnecessary. It seems to me, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  should be withdrawn or  at  least  its\r\n\r\nThird Reading postponed until the Minister has had\r\n\r\ntime fully to digest its exact implications but if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister insists on the maintenance of  these\r\n\r\ndictatorial  powers,  then I  for  one  will  vote\r\n\r\nagainst the Second Reading of this Bill today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  there is a great deal of good in this  Bill.\r\n\r\nIt   has  followed  more  or  less  the  All-Party\r\n\r\nrecommendation to bring all schools under a single\r\n\r\ncontrol  so  that every school will receive  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment.  In  the  past,  teachers   have   been\r\n\r\ndifferentiated: Government teachers, aided  school\r\n\r\nteachers  as well as private school teachers;  one\r\n\r\ntype  of  teachers  receiving  a  great  deal   of\r\n\r\nbenefit, whereas the other classes are left out in\r\n\r\nthe  cold. This Bill is trying to remove the caste\r\n\r\nsystem:  the  high caste of the Government  school\r\n\r\nteachers,  the  middle caste of the  aided  school\r\n\r\nteachers  and the low caste of the private  school\r\n\r\nand  vernacular school teachers. However, I  think\r\n\r\nit has not gone far enough. In this Bill, you will\r\n\r\nfind that preferential treatment is still given to\r\n\r\nGovernment school teachers and although you have a\r\n\r\nvery  large  number of aided schools  because  the\r\n\r\nprivate or partly-aided Chinese schools will  come\r\n\r\nunder this system, yet no teacher can ever hope to\r\n\r\nbe  promoted to Inspector of Schools. Under clause\r\n\r\n51,  the Governor may appoint any officer  of  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of  Education to be  an  Inspector  of\r\n\r\nSchools.  This leaves all the other  teachers  out\r\n\r\ncompletely,  whether they are good,  whether  they\r\n\r\nare  able  or  whether, shall we  say,  they  have\r\n\r\nqualifications  far  above  those  of   Government\r\n\r\nschools. Every teacher in this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1544</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry  is trying to serve Singapore in  his  own\r\n\r\nway. Every teacher is performing the same duty  in\r\n\r\none  school  or  in another. They  should  receive\r\n\r\nequal encouragement and equal treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill also I find, and I must say that I\r\n\r\nhave  to agree with the Member for Cairnhill  (Mr\r\n\r\nMarshall),  that a great deal of  power  has  been\r\n\r\ngiven to the Director of Education. This, I think,\r\n\r\nis  a  wrong  administrative act and I  hope  that\r\n\r\nGovernment will take into consideration  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  of  removing such discontent.  One  way,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  that  will best remove such suspicion,  as\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Education has said that there  is\r\n\r\nsuspicion  and  criticism of  this  Bill  by  many\r\n\r\npeople  outside this Assembly, would be to  commit\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  to Select Committee after  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading and I propose moving that after the Second\r\n\r\nReading.  If  it is agreed to, this Bill  may  yet\r\n\r\nturn  out  to be a good Bill after it has received\r\n\r\nthe  opinion of many people outside this  Assembly\r\n\r\nwho are more qualified to help us shape this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a great number of points in this Bill\r\n\r\nthat seem to be vague and seem to need revision. I\r\n\r\nwill  just  point out a few of these. At  page  2,\r\n\r\nclause  3,  you  will find that the  Minister  may\r\n\r\nexempt  from registration a school that is  purely\r\n\r\nreligious  in character. I will not grumble  about\r\n\r\nthat:  but  if the institution is one  for  higher\r\n\r\neducation,  we  would  like to  know  what  higher\r\n\r\neducation means. We need a definition on  that.  I\r\n\r\nthink  in the Federation they define that  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  also  define  what  higher  education   is\r\n\r\notherwise  it will be left to the opinion  of  the\r\n\r\nDirector or the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Education Finance Board will have four\r\n\r\npersons  to  be  appointed by  the  Minister.  The\r\n\r\nFinance Board is one of the most important  Boards\r\n\r\nin  this system. To leave it to the discretion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister alone and to allow him to appoint  a\r\n\r\nperson  or  to  sack him afterwards would  not  be\r\n\r\ndemocratic.  I  remember that we  also  have  such\r\n\r\nBoards  in  other  Bills.  I  refer  you  to   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Youth  Sports  Centre  Ordinance.   We\r\n\r\nappoint these people by statute and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1545</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallow     institutions    to    nominate     their\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.  Here,  members  of  the  Finance\r\n\r\nBoard  should  be  people who are  connected  with\r\n\r\neducation  or  know something about education.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be  absolutely useless to appoint a  person\r\n\r\nwho  is  not  at  all  connected  with  education;\r\n\r\nperhaps  when you are discussing the necessity  of\r\n\r\nintroducing special types of apparatus or  special\r\n\r\nlessons that need extra provisions, he will be out\r\n\r\nof  his depth. Sir, we have many institutions that\r\n\r\nare good enough to come within this definition and\r\n\r\nif  this Bill goes into Select Committee, we could\r\n\r\nthink of how to appoint such people to this Board,\r\n\r\nnot  by  the  whims and fancies  of  Ministers  or\r\n\r\nDirectors but by statute. Under this provision, as\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  now stands, anyone who is appointed  by\r\n\r\nthe Minister owes him allegiance and will probably\r\n\r\nhave  to  toe his line. It will be very  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  him  to be nonpolitical. If you look  at  his\r\n\r\nduty, you will find that it is even more important\r\n\r\nthat he should be independent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the Advisory Council under clause\r\n\r\n8  (6).  Here you find that some institutions  may\r\n\r\nappoint  their representatives but they  have  the\r\n\r\nright  to  revoke such nominations.  Added  to  it\r\n\r\nagain,  the  Minister can also dismiss the  person\r\n\r\nconcerned.  The arguments for that have  been  put\r\n\r\nforward  to  you, Sir, during the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nPolytechnic Bill and I think those stand for  this\r\n\r\nprovision too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appeals Board under clauses 15 and 16 is\r\n\r\ngiven  some sort of a power equivalent to that  of\r\n\r\nthe  Police  and  the Court but I  wonder  whether\r\n\r\ndecisions by the Appeals Board can be contested in\r\n\r\nthe  High Court because sometimes it may be a very\r\n\r\nimportant  thing, like  the  cancellation  of   a\r\n\r\nschool, and if we have our democratic system,  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court  should  be  the  highest  organ   for\r\n\r\narbitration.  Would  it mean  then  that  such  an\r\n\r\nappeal  cannot go to the High Court and that  this\r\n\r\nBill  will give police as well as judicial  powers\r\n\r\nto  the  Advisory Council whose members are merely\r\n\r\nnominated by the Minister?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For registration under clause 23 (1) (b), the\r\n\r\nDirector  can give conditions for the registration\r\n\r\nof schools. It is very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1546</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvague and should be made clearer. Under clause  23\r\n\r\n(2),  the  powers given would be very wide  indeed\r\n\r\nand  the  Director in every case can use  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal of discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 (a) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may refuse to register a school if\r\n\r\nit shall appear to him that-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) adequate educational facilities already\r\n\r\nexist in the area...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  would  like to point out to Government that  if\r\n\r\neducational facilities were adequate in any  area,\r\n\r\nthen  no  such  schools would  ever  come  up  for\r\n\r\nregistration   and   this  clause   is   therefore\r\n\r\nunnecessary. No one in his right mind will start a\r\n\r\nschool  in an area which probably will not attract\r\n\r\npupils:   it  will  be  like  carrying   coal   to\r\n\r\nNewcastle. Clause 24 (e) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"the area provided for the open air recreation\r\n\r\nof pupils is inadequate or unsatisfactory;\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>We  know that the area in Singapore left for  open\r\n\r\nfields is very limited and it would be too ideal a\r\n\r\ncondition. Many schools today have no open fields.\r\n\r\nWhat  are  we going to do about these schools? Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  if we have unlimited land, we  may  solve\r\n\r\nthis problem but I know that many schools will  be\r\n\r\naffected by this clause. Under paragraphs (g)  and\r\n\r\n(h)  of  clause  24,  I think they  are  aimed  at\r\n\r\nprivate  schools where they say that the fees  are\r\n\r\nexcessive and the qualifications and experience of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed teachers are not adequate.  I  again\r\n\r\nsay that if such conditions ever exist, then it is\r\n\r\nthe  fault  of  the Government for  not  providing\r\n\r\nsufficient  educational facilities for  the  young\r\n\r\npeople so that they have to pay excessive fees and\r\n\r\nthey   have   to   be  taught  by  teachers   with\r\n\r\ninsufficient qualifications or experience. I would\r\n\r\nlike   to  say  that  these  paragraphs  are   not\r\n\r\nnecessary  but  they could be removed  if  we  can\r\n\r\nprovide sufficient schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 26 (2) reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Except with the approval in writing of the\r\n\r\nDirector, no Committee of Management shall  exceed\r\n\r\nfive persons in number.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 gives the power to the Director to\r\n\r\ntake  over  the affairs of a school by  appointing\r\n\r\nadditional managers to such a school. Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  the  Assembly to understand that people  who\r\n\r\ncome in to help us start a school\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1547</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  not  be discouraged. Again you  will  find\r\n\r\nthat  there are many people who are interested  in\r\n\r\ngiving  our young people a better deal to  provide\r\n\r\nmore facilities for our young people but they  may\r\n\r\nor  may not know much about school affairs and  if\r\n\r\nwe  limit  the  Committee of  Management  to  five\r\n\r\npersons, it will be very difficult indeed  to  run\r\n\r\nany  public  school. Clause 27 (2) will definitely\r\n\r\ndiscourage  all  people  who  are  interested   in\r\n\r\ncontributing  to  schools and in  helping  in  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of schools because, after they have put\r\n\r\nin so much money, time and effort for the schools,\r\n\r\nthey  may  find  that  at  the  next  moment   the\r\n\r\nGovernment steps in and the schools are not theirs\r\n\r\nbut will be run by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 28, we find that to be a member of the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of Management or to be the  supervisor,\r\n\r\nyou  must  have  the approval of the  Director.  I\r\n\r\nwonder, Sir, if a person has shown a great deal of\r\n\r\ninterest, if a person knows about education or  if\r\n\r\na   person   helps  financially  and   wishes   to\r\n\r\ncontribute further towards education and to  serve\r\n\r\non  the  Committee, he has still to be  under  the\r\n\r\ninfluence of the Director and approved by him.  It\r\n\r\nreally  will  discourage all people  from  helping\r\n\r\nschools.  Probably,  they will  sit  back  and  do\r\n\r\nnothing about it and I think that the position  of\r\n\r\neducation in Singapore will not progress  as  fast\r\n\r\nas  it  should. After all, I think aided  schools,\r\n\r\nprivate  schools and schools that are not  run  by\r\n\r\nGovernment exceed the number of Government schools\r\n\r\nand  they  cater for a larger number  of  students\r\n\r\nthan Government schools. Yet, if these clauses are\r\n\r\nimposed on them now, we are going to put a stop to\r\n\r\nvoluntary  efforts.  It  is  not  going  to   help\r\n\r\neducation. It is going to impede education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again under clause 30, you have the Director's\r\n\r\napproval  again. I meet with this phrase  so  many\r\n\r\ntimes  that I put a marginal note on my  Bill.  It\r\n\r\nseems  that  the  Director's  approval  is  almost\r\n\r\ncovering the whole of this Bill and that  if  you\r\n\r\nwant  to  help in the schools, you must have  this\r\n\r\napproval;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1548</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nif  you want to be a supervisor you must have this\r\n\r\napproval  and  if you want to be a member  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee   of  Management  you  must  have   this\r\n\r\napproval.  In short, it means that if  I  want  to\r\n\r\nhelp  in the matter of education voluntarily, then\r\n\r\nI  must be a yes-man to the Director. I would  say\r\n\r\nthat  everybody wants education  to  go  on  in  a\r\n\r\ncertain  order and then finally arrive at a  fixed\r\n\r\npoint  where  they cultivate Malayan  loyalty,  or\r\n\r\nSingapore loyalty with a Singapore outlook, and so\r\n\r\non.  But  if we have this system whereby everybody\r\n\r\nis  under the control of one man, we will  have  a\r\n\r\nsystem  producing a uniform type of people. Hitler\r\n\r\ntried it out very successfully and he had all  the\r\n\r\nyouth  behind  him all regimented and  every  time\r\n\r\nthere  was a command, they reacted in exactly  the\r\n\r\nsame  way. We, however, are living in a democratic\r\n\r\ncountry,  and I think everybody should be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  develop in his own way without losing sight of\r\n\r\nthe final aim. We must not compel every school  to\r\n\r\nreact  in  the same way and I think that the  word\r\n\r\n\"approval\"  should be drawn so that we  have  more\r\n\r\nlatitude for all other schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 29, a supervisor who has to be\r\n\r\nappointed.  A  supervisor  has  not  only  to   be\r\n\r\napproved by the Director but he also has to  carry\r\n\r\nout  a  great deal of work from the Department  of\r\n\r\nEducation  and if he does not carry out  his  work\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily,  he  may  be  punished  under  the\r\n\r\npenalties of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 33 (g) says that a person may not be\r\n\r\nappointed  if he has attained the age  of  seventy\r\n\r\nyears.  This seems to me to be very funny  because\r\n\r\nif  a  person who reaches the age of seventy years\r\n\r\nor  over is still capable and is still willing  to\r\n\r\nserve, I see no reason why he should be precluded.\r\n\r\nI  know that there are many prominent people  over\r\n\r\nthe age of seventy years still doing very well and\r\n\r\nmaking great contributions to the nation. This  is\r\n\r\na  very small point but it does seem to me  to  be\r\n\r\nvery,  very funny to exclude people of this  type.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this Bill has been gone through with\r\n\r\nhaste  and without much thought. Even under clause\r\n\r\n38, you will find that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1549</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Director may refuse to register a person as\r\n\r\na teacher if it appears to him that the applicant-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) has previously been refused registration as\r\n\r\na  manager on grounds which would also  have\r\n\r\nprecluded...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Now,   if   he  had  been  precluded  from   being\r\n\r\nregistered as a teacher, conversely he cannot also\r\n\r\nbecome a member of the Committee of Management; it\r\n\r\ndoes  not seem to be logical. A person may not  be\r\n\r\ncapable  of  becoming a teacher but  he  is  quite\r\n\r\ncapable  of helping to run a school. A person  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  capable of becoming a manager of a school\r\n\r\nbut  he may be good enough to be registered  as  a\r\n\r\nteacher  and teach efficiently. I do not  see  how\r\n\r\nthese two could be connected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 29 (c), the duties of the\r\n\r\nSupervisor  shall  be to report  to  the  Director\r\n\r\nforthwith  by notice in writing, and from  another\r\n\r\nsection of the Bill it seems that he has to answer\r\n\r\nimmediately   every   query   of   the   Education\r\n\r\nDepartment. This is in clause 54, Sir. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(i) If it shall appear to the Director that any\r\n\r\nprovisions   of   this  Ordinance   or   of   the\r\n\r\nregulations   made  thereunder  have   not   been\r\n\r\ncomplied  with in any school or that  any  school\r\n\r\nis  not  being properly or efficiently conducted,\r\n\r\nhe  may,  without prejudice to any  other  powers\r\n\r\nvested in him, by notice in writing addressed  to\r\n\r\nthe  supervisor direct him to take within a  time\r\n\r\nto  be stated in the notice such measures as  are\r\n\r\nin the notice specified...\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be very unreasonable and I think the\r\n\r\nonly  way  out is to amend the clause so that  the\r\n\r\nsupervisor  need not take action within  \"a  time\"\r\n\r\nbut  within \"a reasonable time\". This will help  a\r\n\r\nperson who is trying to assist us in our education\r\n\r\nto serve on this Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 51, Sir, with which I have already\r\n\r\ndealt,  I  would say that it leaves out all  other\r\n\r\nschools except Government schools. Government  has\r\n\r\nall  this  while been trying to satisfy the  other\r\n\r\nsystems  of  schools. They are telling  them  that\r\n\r\nthey are now on a par and will not be stepsons any\r\n\r\nlonger. But if clause 51\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1550</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(a)  remains  in  its present  form,  it  will  be\r\n\r\nanother point where there will be a great deal  of\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  not only from  the  English-aided\r\n\r\nschools,  but  from  all  Chinese  and  vernacular\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 53, the Bill now gives great power\r\n\r\nto  the Director and his officers, and very little\r\n\r\nrespect  will  be  shown to  the  principal  of  a\r\n\r\nschool. I would ask Government whether this is the\r\n\r\npresent  procedure. It seems that heads of schools\r\n\r\nare  now  to  be given a position much lower  than\r\n\r\nwhat  they  used to have. Clause 53 (2) gives  the\r\n\r\nofficers  a  great deal of power, and  clause  56,\r\n\r\nSir,  states  that  any person wishing  to  appeal\r\n\r\nagainst  a  decision of the Director shall  within\r\n\r\nthe  period prescribed deliver to the Director two\r\n\r\ncopies  of  a  statement in the  English  language\r\n\r\ngiving notice of his appeal. We passed a motion in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly not so long ago agreeing to  multi-lingualism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> We again stated that all\r\n\r\nschools and all languages should be equal. It will\r\n\r\ntherefore  be  unreasonable to  ask  a  vernacular\r\n\r\nschool  to  reply or to appeal to the Director  or\r\n\r\nthe  Appeals Board in English when what they  know\r\n\r\nis  only  Chinese, Tamil or Malay.  To  make  this\r\n\r\nclause  more palatable and acceptable to everybody\r\n\r\nconcerned, I think that Chinese schools should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  appeal in Chinese, Tamil  schools  in\r\n\r\nTamil  and Malay schools in Malay; English schools\r\n\r\nwill, of course, use English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I find that this whole Bill, although it is\r\n\r\nan  effort  to  correlate every type of  education\r\n\r\ninto one (which is a good thing), is very bad when\r\n\r\nput  in  its  present form, it  is  bad  from  the\r\n\r\nadministrative  point of view.  It  will  cause  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal  of  heartburn.  Instead  of  allaying\r\n\r\nsuspicion, instead of getting the co-operation  of\r\n\r\na  great many more people and bringing them to our\r\n\r\nside,  we will probably find that if this Bill  is\r\n\r\nnot  further considered, it will create  just  the\r\n\r\nreverse  result. I hope that Government will  take\r\n\r\nthis  into  consideration and agree  to  the  Bill\r\n\r\nbeing considered by a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1551</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.21 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I was told that the future of Singapore  was\r\n\r\nbeing   decided  this  morning  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic Ordinance, and that I have  missed  an\r\n\r\ninteresting  discussion on this and other  aspects\r\n\r\nof  the  future development of Singapore. However,\r\n\r\nbeing  much more mundane in my approach, I  choose\r\n\r\nto  imagine that the future of Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\ndecided   more  by  the  educational   policy   of\r\n\r\nsuccessive Singapore Governments than by any other\r\n\r\nsingle matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education policy which the British\r\n\r\nAdministration pursued in the past is  the  reason\r\n\r\nfor    the    confusion,   the    conflicts    and\r\n\r\ncontradictions with which our multi-lingual, multi-cultural  society is confronted  today.  In  their\r\n\r\ndesire  to exploit the natural resources  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  they kept expenses and expenditure  down\r\n\r\nto  the  barest minimum. Large undigested cultural\r\n\r\nand  linguistic  groups  were  left  to  care  for\r\n\r\nthemselves. The Chinese community demonstrated  to\r\n\r\nthe  British  that they could care for themselves.\r\n\r\nNow  any  government which comes into  power  must\r\n\r\ntake  account  of the pride of all the  management\r\n\r\ncommittees,  and  of the Chinese population  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole, in having had the drive and the stamina  to\r\n\r\nkeep their cultural and linguistic world alive  in\r\n\r\nspite    of    government    indifference - colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment  indifference - towards  them.  But   any\r\n\r\ngovernment which wishes to mould a Malayan  nation\r\n\r\nmust  sooner  or  later come  to  grips  with  the\r\n\r\nproblem   of   moulding  the   minds   of   future\r\n\r\ngenerations of Singaporeans and Malayans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question is one of principle: Is the\r\n\r\nGovernment to decide the educational policy, or is\r\n\r\nit  not?  It is clear from the report of the  All-Party  Committee  on  Chinese education  that  the\r\n\r\nright   of   an  elected  government   to   decide\r\n\r\neducational   policy   cannot   be   fettered.   A\r\n\r\ngovernment  must have the right to  implement  its\r\n\r\neducational policy or perish. However,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree   with   the  technique  the  Labour   Front\r\n\r\nGovernment  has chosen to stockade  and  barricade\r\n\r\nitself  behind  the Education Finance  Board,  the\r\n\r\nEducational  Advisory  Council  and  the   Schools\r\n\r\nAppeals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1552</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard. A decision must either, be a quasi-judicial\r\n\r\ndecision  or an administrative decision. Democracy\r\n\r\nmeans  that a people have the right to vote for  a\r\n\r\ngovernment which will have the right to  implement\r\n\r\na programme which it has put before the electorate\r\n\r\nfrom  whom it has received a mandate. This is  the\r\n\r\nfirst  major premise. But the technique of fencing\r\n\r\na  government  behind three statutory  bodies,  in\r\n\r\nwhich the government has the power to nominate the\r\n\r\nmajority - the  overwhelming majority - is  not  one\r\n\r\nwhich   is   likely  to  endear  itself   to   the\r\n\r\nelectorate, The Education Finance Board, according\r\n\r\nto  clause  5 (2), is to consist of six people - two\r\n\r\nofficials  and  four  persons  nominated  by   the\r\n\r\nMinister.  All  six  are  therefore  to   be   the\r\n\r\ngovernment's   men.   The   Educational   Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil, under clause 8 (2), is to consist  of  22\r\n\r\nmembers. Of these, 14 will be government men,  and\r\n\r\neight  will  be non-government men  but  who  must\r\n\r\nnevertheless  have  received  the  approval,   the\r\n\r\nclearance, of the government. The Schools  Appeals\r\n\r\nBoards,  under  clause 12 (2), is  to  consist  of\r\n\r\nseven members. Of these, five are to be government\r\n\r\nmen, and two are to be non-government men but they\r\n\r\nalso are to be first approved by the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely the Minister for Education cannot expect\r\n\r\neducational  institutions in this  Colony  to  sit\r\n\r\nback  and  see  him stockade himself behind  these\r\n\r\nstatutory  tribunals so that  if  anything  should\r\n\r\nhappen, he can take an administrative act and then\r\n\r\nbolster  such action by the support of the alleged\r\n\r\nquasi-judicial decision of one of these  statutory\r\n\r\ntribunals. For these tribunals, being filled  with\r\n\r\ngovernment   men,  will  in  fact  be   government\r\n\r\ndecisions.   The  question  of   how   far   these\r\n\r\ncouncils - the Advisory, Finance and Schools Appeals\r\n\r\nBoards - are  to  act  as quasi-judicial  or  purely\r\n\r\nadvisory  tribunals, must be decided on principle.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that if the Minister wishes to have\r\n\r\nthe last word in every administrative act, then he\r\n\r\nshould  have  the  courage to let the  Educational\r\n\r\nAdvisory Council have a majority of unofficial  or\r\n\r\nnon-government members, so that if he  chooses  to\r\n\r\ngo  against  the advice of the Council  (which  he\r\n\r\nshould\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1553</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  entitled to do), he should be prepared to face\r\n\r\ncriticism from educational institutions and public\r\n\r\nopinion, because he cannot bulldoze an educational\r\n\r\npolicy which is being resisted by the majority  of\r\n\r\nour population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can gather, the criticisms against\r\n\r\nthis Bill are on the administrative provisions  in\r\n\r\nclauses  5,  8  and 12 relating to  the  Education\r\n\r\nFinance  Board,  the Educational Advisory  Council\r\n\r\nand the Schools Appeals Board; on the registration\r\n\r\nof  schools  and the cancellation of registrations\r\n\r\nin  clauses 24 and 25; and on the registration and\r\n\r\ncancellation  of  certificates  for  teachers   in\r\n\r\nclauses  38  and 39. Whilst the Government  should\r\n\r\nhave   an   unfettered  right  in   administrative\r\n\r\ndecisions,  questions as to  the  registration  of\r\n\r\nschools and the cancellation of registrations, and\r\n\r\nto  the registration and cancellation of teachers,\r\n\r\npeculiarly lend themselves to consideration  by  a\r\n\r\nquasi-judicial tribunal. The Minister will be well\r\n\r\nadvised   to  rid  himself  of  this  very   grave\r\n\r\nresponsibility of having to take away the right of\r\n\r\na  school  to exist, or the right of a teacher  to\r\n\r\ncontinue   to   teach.   He   should   give   this\r\n\r\nresponsibility to an independent tribunal, to make\r\n\r\nthe decision on certain given principles laid down\r\n\r\nbeforehand, whether a school is to continue to  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to exist, or a teacher should be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  continue  teaching or should  cease  to  be  a\r\n\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, therefore, I can sum up my Party's views\r\n\r\non  this  Bill  as follows: Questions  as  to  the\r\n\r\nregistration  and  cancellation  of  schools   and\r\n\r\nteachers   should  be  sent  to  a  quasi-judicial\r\n\r\ntribunal  so that the Minister will not  have  the\r\n\r\npower  to make or the odium of having made a party\r\n\r\npolitical  decision  against  either  schools   or\r\n\r\nteachers.  As to the Education Finance Board,  the\r\n\r\nEducational  Advisory  Council  and  the   Schools\r\n\r\nAppeals  Board,  decisions, except  those  on  the\r\n\r\nregistration  and  cancellation  of  schools   and\r\n\r\nteachers, must be executive ones because they  are\r\n\r\ndecisions  on  educational policy. Any  government\r\n\r\nwhich  has not got the courage to state its policy\r\n\r\nfor  the  education of the future generation,  but\r\n\r\ngoes  beating about the bush hoping to get support\r\n\r\nfrom all directions\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1554</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  finally  winding up with support  from  none,\r\n\r\nwill  not only perish, but will make the whole  of\r\n\r\nSingapore perish with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be seconding a motion\r\n\r\nby the Member for Serangoon to send this Bill to a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee. It is in the interests not  only\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  and of the  Parties  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly, but of the whole of Singapore, that this\r\n\r\nquestion of education should be fully debated  and\r\n\r\nsettled in a thorough manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  support the proposal of the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon  that this Bill be committed  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee for further discussion. We  just\r\n\r\nheard  the  hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  on  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of education. Allow me to add  further\r\n\r\ncomments.  We have made known to the  people  that\r\n\r\nour political struggle at this stage only aims  at\r\n\r\nself-government,  and that independence  is  still\r\n\r\nfar away. Why? This question has haunted me for  a\r\n\r\nlong  time.  At this stage, we are not  ready  for\r\n\r\nindependence, but what can we do to realise it? We\r\n\r\nhave  no guns and, even if we have, there  are  so\r\n\r\nfew   hands  to  hold  them.  However,  one   most\r\n\r\neffective  weapon we can hold is the pen.  If  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore are more capable of  holding\r\n\r\nthe  pen  than  the  gun,  the  prospects  of  our\r\n\r\nnational  struggle  will be brighter.  Our  people\r\n\r\nshould be equipped with effective pens, and it  is\r\n\r\nthe  duty of the Minister for Education to do  so,\r\n\r\nto   provide  us  with  an  effective  educational\r\n\r\npolicy.  When I came in just now, an  hon.  Member\r\n\r\nasked  for my opinion on this Bill. I said  I  was\r\n\r\nnot  very happy about it. Indeed, I have not  been\r\n\r\nhappy  since  last April when the Minister  rushed\r\n\r\nthrough  the White Paper. I have had no confidence\r\n\r\nin  the Government's educational policy since then\r\n\r\nbecause  the  White  Paper,  which  outlined   the\r\n\r\nbackground of our whole educational system, was so\r\n\r\nbadly done,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1555</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncreated so many suspicions and even tried  to  run\r\n\r\ndown  a certain educational system. I believe  the\r\n\r\npresent  Bill  has been drafted by the  author  of\r\n\r\nthat  White  Paper, or that he has at  least  been\r\n\r\nclosely connected with drawing up the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My opposition to the White Paper was that it did\r\n\r\nnot  take  into consideration the vital  political\r\n\r\nadvancement  and  changes in this country.  Multi-lingualism, for example, has been accepted by this\r\n\r\ncountry, yet our educational system, to judge from\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper and the present Bill, would raise\r\n\r\ndoubts  in  the  many educational bodies,  whether\r\n\r\nGovernment  is following the lines recommended  by\r\n\r\nthe All-Party Committee as it professes to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section (v) in the All-Party Committee's report\r\n\r\nsays  that  the  greatest  hope  for  multi-racial\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  be  to ensure  that  the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration  grow up under the best  conditions  of\r\n\r\nintermingling; and that everything should be  done\r\n\r\nto break down mutual exclusiveness between the two\r\n\r\nstreams   of  education,  that  is,  English   and\r\n\r\nvernacular. As a member of the All-Party Committee\r\n\r\nseeking  to  build  a true Malayan  nation  and  a\r\n\r\nunified education system, I wonder how much  proof\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  give to the people  that  it  has\r\n\r\nimplemented the recommendations of the  Committee,\r\n\r\nrecommendations made a year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps someone will say to me. \"You are a\r\n\r\nChinese  and  therefore you are bound  not  to  be\r\n\r\nimpartial  on  education;  you  are  bound  to  be\r\n\r\nfighting only for Chinese education.\" Sir, I  take\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to make it clear that this is not\r\n\r\ntrue. I fight for justice, for the true welfare of\r\n\r\nthe  people. If we accept the principle of  multi-lingualism  in  this country, how can  we  try  to\r\n\r\nrestrict  the  free growth of educational  systems\r\n\r\nother  than  the English? The Bill is supposed  to\r\n\r\nfurther the unification of educational systems  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  yet  it contains so many  restrictions\r\n\r\nand  regulations  against this objective,  as  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill has so clearly pointed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1556</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no doubt, at this stage, the Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  have  become  a  problem  child  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  A top-ranking officer told me  not  long\r\n\r\nago that he was not worried even about gangsterism\r\n\r\nbut  that  he  was concerned about Chinese  school\r\n\r\nstudents.  From such an attitude, we  can  perhaps\r\n\r\ngauge  the  true  spirit  which  has  guided   the\r\n\r\ndrafting  of  the  Bill. Sir, my support  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in the riots last October is  clear;  I\r\n\r\nam  also aware of certain subversive activities in\r\n\r\nschools.  But  Sir, still I cannot understand  why\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   trying   to   introduce    these\r\n\r\nregulations and restrictions on the free growth of\r\n\r\nother educational systems, especially the Chinese.\r\n\r\nLong  before  Government  considered  a  bilingual\r\n\r\nsystem,  it was already being followed in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  but never in English schools,  even  now,\r\n\r\ntwo  years  after an elected government came  into\r\n\r\npower. How many English school students are  there\r\n\r\nwho can read and write Chinese? But there are many\r\n\r\nChinese  school  students who can read  and  write\r\n\r\nEnglish  even  up to Cambridge School  Certificate\r\n\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government believes that our\r\n\r\nentrepot trade will always boom and bring us  rich\r\n\r\nrevenue,  and we are going to control and  provide\r\n\r\nsufficiently for all educational institutions  for\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore, then I have no objection\r\n\r\nat  all to this Bill. But if the Government should\r\n\r\none day find that its resources are dried up, when\r\n\r\nthe  price  of rubber drops to 50 cents per  pound\r\n\r\nand   our  trade  shrinks,  and  under  the  Bill,\r\n\r\nmanagement  committees  must  register  and  their\r\n\r\nexistence  be  at the discretion of Mr  McLellan,\r\n\r\nwho may say, \"No\"...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

This Bill will only end further voluntary\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  promoting  education,  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  will not easily forget it. Government  has\r\n\r\nproudly proclaimed that Malay education has always\r\n\r\nbeen looked after properly and is provided for  by\r\n\r\nGovernment, yet how many Malay schools  have  been\r\n\r\nprovided? And what have the Malay schools produced\r\n\r\nin raising Malay cultural standards today?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the suspicions of, I may say, the majority\r\n\r\nof the people, still exist. I do not like the word\r\n\r\n\"dictator\"  applied to those in power,  but  I  do\r\n\r\nthink that the discretionary, extraordinary powers\r\n\r\nprovided by the Bill for the Director of Education\r\n\r\nare  really unsound. I hope the Hon. the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Education can clear my doubts. There are many\r\n\r\nmore  like me outside this Assembly who would like\r\n\r\nto know the answers to my two questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Do you sincerely believe every word of the\r\n\r\nAll-Party Committee's Report on Education?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Can you convince the people-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

The  public  do  not  understand  the\r\n\r\nintricate  government machinery.

But administratively, the Director  of\r\n\r\nEducation receives his instructions from me or the\r\n\r\nPermanent  Secretary, and I can assure  the  House\r\n\r\nthat,  where  the Director of Education  is  given\r\n\r\ndiscretionary powers under this Bill, he will  not\r\n\r\nexercise those powers without the authority of the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretary (who is my chief adviser),  or\r\n\r\nmyself.  I  will see to it that, as soon  as  this\r\n\r\nBill  becomes law, administrative action  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken to provide this safeguard in my Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> The Member for Cairnhill has\r\n\r\nplaced  a  lot of emphasis on clause 24 (o), (p),\r\n\r\n(q),  clause 33 (i) and so forth, and he says that\r\n\r\nin  clause  22  there can be no  appeal  where  an\r\n\r\napplication for registration has been  refused.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to refer him to clause 56 where it  is\r\n\r\nstated  that any person wishing to appeal  against\r\n\r\nany decision - any decision - of the Director, can  do\r\n\r\nso;  and of course it prescribes the form in which\r\n\r\nthe  appeal  is to be made to either  the  Appeals\r\n\r\nBoard or to the Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 48, the provisions under which the\r\n\r\npublic or the aggrieved parties must appeal to the\r\n\r\nMinister involve questions of public security.

That is, of course, not true. It only\r\n\r\nmeans  notifying  in  the Gazette  the  names  of\r\n\r\nofficers  of  the  Department of  Education;  the\r\n\r\nappointment   or  enrolment  of   inspectors   is\r\n\r\nentirely   an  administrative  action.   If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  appoints teachers from other  schools\r\n\r\nto   be   officers   of  the   Department,   they\r\n\r\nautomatically become officers of that Department,\r\n\r\nand  they  are of course entitled to be appointed\r\n\r\nas inspectors of schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is a very important one and, as\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanjong Pagar rightly  said,  the\r\n\r\ncountry  must be given an educational policy  and\r\n\r\nthe   Government  must  be  unfettered   in   its\r\n\r\nimplementation. It is my intention to accept  the\r\n\r\nproposal  put  forward by the Opposition  Parties\r\n\r\nthat   this  Bill  be  committed  to   a   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon also says that the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of certain clauses  in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwill  be  subject  to the whims  and  fancies  of\r\n\r\nMinisters. Well, I think Ministers do  not  exist\r\n\r\non  whims  and fancies, and certainly no Minister\r\n\r\nwill ever exercise any discretion because he  has\r\n\r\ncertain whims and fancies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have replied to all the important\r\n\r\npoints  raised,  and as this  Bill  is  going  to\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee,  I propose  to  cut  short  my\r\n\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1560</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\">COMMITTAL TO SELECT COMMITTEE</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\nmove,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Bill be committed to a Select Committee\r\n\r\nwith Mr Speaker as Chairman and seven Members to\r\n\r\nbe nominated by the Committee of Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.
