Wages  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are currently under pressure because of  cyclical\r\n\r\nand structural reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cyclical front, the weakness of the global\r\n\r\neconomy  and SARS have led to the poor performance  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy  since 2001.  The second quarter of this  year  was\r\n\r\nparticularly  bad,  aggravated by the  uncertainty  of  the\r\n\r\nIraqi War.  However, with the war over and SARS behind  us,\r\n\r\nfor  the time being at least, our economy is likely  to  be\r\n\r\nbetter  in the second half. The US economy is also  showing\r\n\r\nsigns  of recovery with a better than expected 2.4%  growth\r\n\r\nin  the  second  quarter.  Many analysts  believe  that  US\r\n\r\ngrowth  in  the  second half could be even  stronger.   Our\r\n\r\nforecast  of  0 - 1% growth for this year implies  that  we\r\n\r\nexpect our economy to grow by 1.3 - 3.3% in the second half\r\n\r\nof the year, compared to a contraction of 1.3% in the first\r\n\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our economy may improve in the coming months, we\r\n\r\nface  serious longer-term structural challenges.  The entry\r\n\r\nof  China,  India,  Vietnam and other  countries  into  the\r\n\r\nglobal market place means that the wages of many workers in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will come under strong downward pressure.   This\r\n\r\npressure is across the board because of the large number of\r\n\r\nskilled  workers, technicians, engineers,  programmers  and\r\n\r\nothers from these countries who are prepared to do the same\r\n\r\nwork  for much less money. Outsourcing has resulted  in  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly globalised labour market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, skill for skill, job for job, our workers and\r\n\r\nprofessionals do command a significant premium  over  their\r\n\r\ncompetitors  in  other countries because of our  reputation\r\n\r\nfor   quality  and  reliability,  and  the  efficiency  and\r\n\r\nintegrity  of  the  system  that  we  have.  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nreputation  enhances the value of all Singaporeans  in  the\r\n\r\nglobal  marketplace. Hence, we continue  to  attract  large\r\n\r\ninvestments  in the manufacturing sectors like electronics,\r\n\r\nengineering,  petrochemicals and the  biomedical  sciences,\r\n\r\nand  in  the services sectors like the financial  industry,\r\n\r\ntourism and logistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this Singapore premium is finite. Beyond a point,\r\n\r\nwe  are  not  worth the premium and, if our wages  are  too\r\n\r\nhigh,  the  investments  will flow  elsewhere  instead,  as\r\n\r\nindeed  is  already  happening  in  some  sectors.  It   is\r\n\r\ntherefore very important for us to watch our costs,  labour\r\n\r\nbeing  a  key component of total cost. We have to make  our\r\n\r\nwage   structure  more  flexible.   It  has  to   be   more\r\n\r\nperformance-based   (less   seniority-based),   and    more\r\n\r\nresponsive  to changes in business conditions. The  way  to\r\n\r\nreduce   adjustment   pains  is  to  allow   for   frequent\r\n\r\nadjustments in our wage structure and, more importantly, in\r\n\r\nour  thinking.  This  is the way for  us  to  maintain  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  and  safeguard  our  jobs  in  a   rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging  global economy.  If we do not adjust our standard\r\n\r\nof  living to stay competitive, the market will force it on\r\n\r\nus  in a more painful way through the outflow of investment\r\n\r\nand retrenchment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the cost of living in Singapore, it has remained\r\n\r\nrelatively stable in recent years. Between 1997 - 2002, the\r\n\r\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) has risen by only 0.6% per year,\r\n\r\nand  in  fact fell 0.4% last year.  The Government monitors\r\n\r\nthis index closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Sir, with the wage\r\n\r\nreforms  that  are on-going, the basic pay of  our  workers\r\n\r\nwill be cut.

I have been given the privilege  to\r\n\r\ngive the initial response to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On economic restructuring, with rising competition and\r\n\r\ntechnological changes, we need to restructure  our  economy\r\n\r\nin  two  main ways. First, we need to shift towards a  more\r\n\r\nflexible   and  competitive  cost  structure.  This   means\r\n\r\nreforming  our  wage  structure to be  more  responsive  to\r\n\r\nchanges  in  business  conditions, and  re-tuning  our  CPF\r\n\r\nsystem  to  reduce statutory burden on employers.  We  must\r\n\r\nalso\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlower   direct  taxes,  and  price  our  land   and   other\r\n\r\ninfrastructure services competitively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we need to shift towards higher value-added,\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  activities.  This  means  moving  up   the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing value chain, growing exportable services, and\r\n\r\nupgrading  our domestic services sector. Of the  12,000  to\r\n\r\n15,000 new jobs that EDB will bring in this year, more than\r\n\r\n85% will require skilled workers. We must therefore upgrade\r\n\r\nthe  capabilities  of  our  work force,  and  re-skill  our\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will turn to assistance and training for\r\n\r\nunemployed  Singaporeans.   Under  its  Place   and   Train\r\n\r\nprogramme,  the  Manpower  Ministry   works  with  industry\r\n\r\npartners  to  first  place job seekers with  a  prospective\r\n\r\nemployer, before sending them for training. This is  better\r\n\r\nthan  the train-then-place approach as it minimises wastage\r\n\r\nin  training. MOM will work with EDB and employers to match\r\n\r\njob   seekers  with  new  jobs  created,  and  provide  the\r\n\r\nnecessary training to equip them with the right skills  and\r\n\r\nknowledge.  Payroll-support for training will  be  provided\r\n\r\nthrough the Skills Redevelopment Fund (SRF).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on employment and rehabilitation of ex-criminals, we do not track the proportion of unemployed who\r\n\r\nare  ex-prisoners  or  released  from  Drug  Rehabilitation\r\n\r\nCentres  (DRCs).   Every  year,  there  are  about   11,000\r\n\r\noffenders released from prisons and DRCs.  In the first six\r\n\r\nmonths  of  this  year,  more than  900  ex-offenders  have\r\n\r\napproached  the  Singapore  Corporation  of  Rehabilitative\r\n\r\nEnterprises  (SCORE) to seek assistance in  securing  jobs.\r\n\r\nOf   these,   39%  were  successfully  placed  in   gainful\r\n\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offenders are prepared for gainful employment while\r\n\r\nthey  are  still in prison and DRCs.  SCORE  provides  them\r\n\r\nwith  vocational training in various skills  such  as  food\r\n\r\npreparation,  metal  work and electronics.  Employers  also\r\n\r\nparticipate in training sponsorship and offering  jobs.  In\r\n\r\n2001, the Prisons Department embarked on a public education\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  counter prejudices in employing ex-offenders.\r\n\r\nEarlier this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear,  SCORE and a local company produced a movie `Twilight\r\n\r\nKitchen' which traces the struggle of an ex-offender trying\r\n\r\nto  gain  acceptance at his work place.  The movie will  be\r\n\r\nscreened  to  grassroots organisations  to  create  greater\r\n\r\nawareness  on  the  role  that the community  can  play  in\r\n\r\nreintegrating ex-offenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Sir, in view of our\r\n\r\neconomic  restructuring, how do we intend to actually  grow\r\n\r\nthose  sectors that will be our cash cows?

Would we be eliminating these sectors\r\n\r\nand,  if  so,  how  should we relocate employees  in  these\r\n\r\nsectors?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> There are three key\r\n\r\nthrusts in the strategy going ahead.  One is that we intend\r\n\r\nto  expand  our external ties and that is why we  have  the\r\n\r\nfree trade agreements and the informal people networks that\r\n\r\nwe have launched.  This is one of the key thrusts, which is\r\n\r\nbasically to have a globalised economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thrust is to create an entrepreneurial\r\n\r\neconomy  and  this is to create Singapore as  a  source  of\r\n\r\nenterprise  itself  -  a  market  for  talents,  ideas  and\r\n\r\ncapital.   Finally,  a  diversified economy  that,  besides\r\n\r\nmanufacturing, the other pillar of growth will be  services\r\n\r\nand  we  will expand these services not just to  strengthen\r\n\r\nour  traditional areas of strength like logistics,  finance\r\n\r\nor  tourism but in new areas, such as healthcare, education\r\n\r\nand the creative industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the broad strategy. How it actually shapes\r\n\r\nup,  I  think  we  will  have to  let  the  market  decide,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  movement  of labour  and  people  into  the\r\n\r\ndifferent industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Can I just ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether he thinks that Singapore can  effectively\r\n\r\ncompete in the manufacturing sector in the coming years  in\r\n\r\nthe  light of the competition that we face from India  and,\r\n\r\nparticularly, China, with their cheaper source of labour?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> I am quite confident that\r\n\r\nwe  will be able to compete.  What is important is that  we\r\n\r\nensure that the economy as a whole is cost-competitive  and\r\n\r\nwhat   is  important  in  terms  of  competition  for   the\r\n\r\ninvestment dollar is really the total package.  It  is  not\r\n\r\njust  a  question of absolute cost but, at the end  of  the\r\n\r\nday,  it  is  really  output  per  unit  of  cost  that  is\r\n\r\nimportant.   It  is  for  this reason  that  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nmanaged to continue to hold its own in the contest for  the\r\n\r\ninvestment  dollar.   Last year, we  brought  in  about  $9\r\n\r\nbillion  in  fixed  asset manufacturing  investment.   This\r\n\r\nyear,  as  the Prime Minister has announced in his National\r\n\r\nDay message, we are looking at about $7.5 billion.  We will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  get major investments into Singapore.   So  I\r\n\r\nthink it is the totality.

The\r\n\r\nGovernment's co-funding share for LETAS was raised from 50%\r\n\r\nto  70% for first-time applicants in October 1999, and  for\r\n\r\nthe   National  Cost  of  Quality  and  Financial   Advisor\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in  November 2001. The intent  was  to  promote\r\n\r\nawareness of SMEs on LETAS and these two programmes. As the\r\n\r\nobjective has since been met - for instance, the number  of\r\n\r\nfirst-time  applicants for LETAS doubled from 1,500  in  FY\r\n\r\n1999  to 3,000 in FY 2002 - the co-funding share for  these\r\n\r\ncategories has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreverted  to the normal 50% in July 2003. This  will  allow\r\n\r\nthe  pool of LETAS funds to support more SME upgrading  and\r\n\r\nnew programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than these modifications to LETAS, there are no\r\n\r\nchanges  to  either  the  Local Enterprise  Finance  Scheme\r\n\r\n(LEFS)  or the Micro Loan Programme.  In fact, during  this\r\n\r\neconomic  slowdown,  LEFS  has  been  enhanced  twice,   in\r\n\r\nNovember 2001 and June 2003, and both in terms of moving it\r\n\r\nup so that more medium enterprises, and down to the smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies,  would qualify for LEFS.   I wish to  assure  Dr\r\n\r\nNeo  that  the  Government is aware of  the  importance  of\r\n\r\nhelping  SMEs in these challenging times.  We are  in  fact\r\n\r\nlooking into expanding the Loan Insurance Scheme (LIS)  and\r\n\r\nthe  Bridging Loan Programme to benefit more SMEs.  Details\r\n\r\nwill be announced when ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> May I ask the Minister of\r\n\r\nState  whether reducing the quantum for LETAS in fact  runs\r\n\r\ncounter  to  the bigger picture of the need to  revive  our\r\n\r\neconomy and to increase entrepreneurship?  Should there not\r\n\r\nbe   priority  given  to  assist  local  businesses,   with\r\n\r\nconcerted  efforts  by  various  Ministries,  rather   than\r\n\r\ncutting back?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> LETAS was, right from the\r\n\r\nstart,  a  co-funding  scheme,  and  it  was  50%  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  50%  by the company itself.   This  is  to\r\n\r\nensure commitment.  As I have explained, the reason why  we\r\n\r\nwent  up to 70% was for a particular period of time,  which\r\n\r\nis  promotional.  The issue here is really to get  SMEs  to\r\n\r\nupgrade their capabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue that the hon. Member brought up is\r\n\r\nreally  a matter of how best to help SMEs when it comes  to\r\n\r\ncash-flow financing.  That is the difficulty we have in  an\r\n\r\neconomic  downturn  -  not  just a  question  of  upgrading\r\n\r\ncapabilities, but how do we help them so that  a  liquidity\r\n\r\nproblem does not turn into an insolvency problem.  And here\r\n\r\nthere is actually a whole range of schemes that has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlaunched by the Government and which is still in existence.\r\n\r\nAs I said, LEFS is one scheme where you can actually tap on\r\n\r\nit  for  working  capital.  The Micro Loan Scheme  actually\r\n\r\nhelps  very small companies to tide over difficult  periods\r\n\r\nwhere they are tight in their cash flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bridging Loan Programme, which was introduced\r\n\r\nduring  the  SARS outbreak and which is still in operation,\r\n\r\nseeks  again  to help companies who are particularly  badly\r\n\r\naffected  during the SARS outbreak in terms of their  cashflow requirements.  So there is a whole range of schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State whether\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry  has been stringent in approving applications\r\n\r\nunder  the  various schemes, such as LETAS, LEFS  and  MLP?\r\n\r\nWhat are the approval rates for such schemes?  Is there too\r\n\r\nmuch  red tape associated with these schemes?  Am I correct\r\n\r\nto  say  that LETAS application is cumbersome, requiring  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  information and difficult ones, such as the impact\r\n\r\nof  the  project  on  the company's future  operations  and\r\n\r\nbusiness?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Actually that is not a\r\n\r\ndifficult question.  If I were to give you money,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to know what are your company's plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Government too stringent in approving\r\n\r\napplications  under  LEFS, LETAS  and  MLP?   I  think  our\r\n\r\nphilosophy must be that at the end of the day to use market\r\n\r\nmechanism to decide, because funds are finite and  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  to find a way to allocate the funds to those who  are\r\n\r\nmost  deserving  of help.  The way we have gone  around  is\r\n\r\nbasically to use financial players who are already  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry,  rather  than  for the Government  to  substitute\r\n\r\nitself for the financial players.  So, in the case of LEFS,\r\n\r\nfor   instance,   we   have   17  participating   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does the Government help? The Government helps by\r\n\r\nproviding  the credit line.  The problem for  SMEs  is  the\r\n\r\nperception  by industry players that the risks are  higher.\r\n\r\nBy  providing the credit line, the Government  is  actually\r\n\r\nlowering  the  risks  for  the  financial  player  that  is\r\n\r\nactually\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nawarding  a particular loan.  So, the Government takes  80%\r\n\r\nof the risks and the financial industry player takes 20%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue here is in terms of expertise. Does\r\n\r\nthe  particular  financial institution understand  the  SME\r\n\r\nbusiness well enough in order to assess it and give out the\r\n\r\nloan?   Increasingly,  the market will  have  players  that\r\n\r\nspecialise in SMEs financing.  For instance, recently, OCBC\r\n\r\nBank  has announced that it is going into partnership  with\r\n\r\nHong Kong SME Loan, which specialises in cash-flow lending,\r\n\r\nwhich  is important for SMEs.  Hong Leong Finance  is  also\r\n\r\npositioning  itself as a SME bank to help them.   So,  that\r\n\r\nmust be the approach.  The Government should not substitute\r\n\r\nitself  for existing financial players, because that  would\r\n\r\nbe crowding them out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, I think the\r\n\r\nMinister  of State missed the point that Dr Neo was  trying\r\n\r\nto  get  at.  Is it not possible to simplify the procedures\r\n\r\nwhen  applying  for such grants?  One of  the  most  common\r\n\r\ncomplaints  among  the SMEs when applying  for  the  grants\r\n\r\nunder the schemes is the number of forms and questions that\r\n\r\nthey  have  to answer, bearing in mind that many  of  these\r\n\r\ncompanies do not have professional backup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I would like to pose is that in\r\n\r\nsubmitting their business plans, many of these SMEs have to\r\n\r\nengage  consultants.   I  understand  that  previously  the\r\n\r\nconsultancy fees were heavily subsidised.  Am  I  right  to\r\n\r\nsay that the consultancy fees are no longer subsidised,  or\r\n\r\nhas the subsidy been significantly reduced and, if so, why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> The short answer to the\r\n\r\nquestion  whether  or not there is too much  administrative\r\n\r\nhassle in applying for a loan is that if that is the  case,\r\n\r\ngive me the details and we will look into them.  Our aim is\r\n\r\nto  facilitate.  The fact of the matter is that there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  a  lot of loans that have been approved.  But if,  at\r\n\r\nthe margin, there are excessive rules that you think we can\r\n\r\ncut down, the answer is yes, we will look into them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of the consultancy fees, there is still\r\n\r\nsubsidy  for  the  consultancy  fees.

So, it  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  these  lessees  would  have  difficulty   in\r\n\r\nservicing their loans for the bigger flat types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I indicated in my answer, so long as buyers buy\r\n\r\nwithin their means, in other words, take into consideration\r\n\r\ntheir own incomes as well as the flat types and do not  buy\r\n\r\na  flat  which  is bigger than what they can  afford,  then\r\n\r\nthere  is no problem.  So, the commitment of the Government\r\n\r\nto provide basic housing - which is either a 3-room or a 4-room  flat - for the majority of Singaporeans is still very\r\n\r\nmuch  in  place.   But as to specific cases  of  individual\r\n\r\nlessees  wanting  to  defer,  HDB  always  takes   a   very\r\n\r\nsympathetic view.  So long as the difficulties are genuine,\r\n\r\nHDB would usually allow lessees to defer the collection  of\r\n\r\nkeys by a few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

Can this\r\n\r\nbe  done?   Would HDB allow this without any penalty  being\r\n\r\nimposed on the individuals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Usually, when a person purchases or\r\n\r\nbooks  a  flat,  he  or  she is advised  to  consider  very\r\n\r\ncarefully before he or she makes that purchase.   Buying  a\r\n\r\nflat is not like buying a TV set or even buying a car.   It\r\n\r\nis a very major commitment.  I would urge people who make a\r\n\r\ncommitment  or  wish  to buy a flat to consider  carefully.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, consider the affordability - whether they can\r\n\r\nafford  the flat.  Secondly, consider the timing, location,\r\n\r\netc.   I think it is not a frivolous commitment.  It  is  a\r\n\r\ncommitment  that has to be taken seriously.   If  we  allow\r\n\r\npeople to book a flat and suddenly opt out of the system at\r\n\r\nno  cost,  it  is going to incur a very heavy  penalty  and\r\n\r\ninconvenience  for  many  other  buyers.    This   is   the\r\n\r\nexperience we had when we had the queue.  When we  had  the\r\n\r\nqueue, people could just drop out of the queue without  any\r\n\r\npenalty and we ended up with a huge backlog of flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there must be responsibility on the part of\r\n\r\nevery  buyer, that when he buys a flat, that  is,  when  he\r\n\r\nmakes  a  downpayment, he makes a commitment, a  commitment\r\n\r\nwhich   allows   HDB   to  plan  the   building   programme\r\n\r\naccordingly.   He also helps to defray some  of  the  costs\r\n\r\nincurred by HDB in preparing the flat for sale.  HDB  would\r\n\r\nnot  normally  waive the cancellation cost associated  with\r\n\r\nsomebody who is cancelling the purchase of a flat.  But  as\r\n\r\nalways with HDB - and I have said this many times before  - anybody who has a genuine and strong case can always put it\r\n\r\nup to HDB.  They would always look at it as sympathetically\r\n\r\nas possible although the answer is not always \"yes\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, would the Minister give\r\n\r\nus  a  breakdown  of the number of 3-room  flats  that  are\r\n\r\navailable,  in terms of the demand and supply numbers,  and\r\n\r\nwhether  there is a greater demand for the 3-room flats  as\r\n\r\nit is now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I do not have the figure for the\r\n\r\ndemand,  but  I know that there are roughly about  200,000-250,000  3-room flats available in the market.

They want to downgrade to a smaller flat  but\r\n\r\nwhen  they  go to the banks for loans, they find that  they\r\n\r\ncannot  get  a  bank  loan. So they  ask  whether  HDB  can\r\n\r\nconsider  giving HDB loans, even though it is for a  resale\r\n\r\nflat, on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, HDB does consider such\r\n\r\napplications  on  a  case-by-case basis, particularly  when\r\n\r\nthere  are  demonstrable cases of difficulty  or  hardship,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  a person or a family member has lost his  job  or\r\n\r\nsuffered  a  salary  cut or because  of  illness  or  heavy\r\n\r\nfinancial   commitments  elsewhere,  etc.   So  there   are\r\n\r\ncircumstances whereby HDB would be sympathetic to  granting\r\n\r\nHDB  loans  even  for  downgraders,  although  the  general\r\n\r\nprinciple is that it would not do so.  I know that HDB  has\r\n\r\nfavourably considered such applications before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister whether HDB would consider lowering the price\r\n\r\nof  new  flats  if  the affordability of  Singaporeans  has\r\n\r\nindeed   become  lower  and  also  if  the  costs  of   the\r\n\r\nconstruction have indeed become lower, such as construction\r\n\r\ncost and land cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, on the first part of the\r\n\r\nquestion, first of all, the commitment to make either a  3- or  4-room flat affordable to Singaporeans must be premised\r\n\r\non, firstly, what is the wage level and, secondly, how much\r\n\r\nof that wage level should be used to buy a flat.  As a rule\r\n\r\nof  thumb,  based  on the guidelines which  banks  use  for\r\n\r\ncredit  assessments,  banks would  say  that  ideally,  you\r\n\r\nshould not be using more than 40% of your monthly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome  for  mortgage payments towards a flat.  Using  that\r\n\r\ncriterion,  ideally,  the  HDB  flat  would  be  considered\r\n\r\naffordable  if the mortgage payments do not exceed  40%  of\r\n\r\nthe person's income.  Based on that criterion and based  on\r\n\r\nthe  figures that we have for the last few years,  I  would\r\n\r\nsay  that HDB flats are more than affordable.  For example,\r\n\r\na  family earning $2,000 could comfortably afford a  3-room\r\n\r\nflat  because  the  repayments  for  a  3-room  flat  would\r\n\r\nconstitute maybe something like 20% of his monthly  income.\r\n\r\nOf   course,  if,  for  example,  wage  levels  deteriorate\r\n\r\ndrastically to the extent that for that same flat, he would\r\n\r\nnow  have  to pay more than 40%, then obviously,  we  would\r\n\r\nhave  to adjust HDB flat prices.  That is what I meant when\r\n\r\nI say we would make sure that HDB flats are affordable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether HDB flats can be re-priced because land\r\n\r\ncosts  or construction costs have gone down, I have  always\r\n\r\nexplained  in this House that the pricing of HDB  flats  is\r\n\r\nbased on the criterion of affordability which implies  that\r\n\r\na  certain  element of subsidy is built into  HDB  pricing.\r\n\r\nEvery new HDB flat sold in Singapore carries a subsidy  and\r\n\r\nthe  extent  of  that  subsidy varies from  time  to  time,\r\n\r\ndepending  on the market.  But the bottomline is that  that\r\n\r\nflat   is   affordable  to  that  particular   segment   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   So  90% of Singaporeans would  be  able  to\r\n\r\nafford a 3-room flat comfortably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Sir, there is really a\r\n\r\ndemand for 3-room flats on the ground.  As an indication of\r\n\r\nthe size of the demand for downgrading, how many lessees of\r\n\r\n4-room and bigger flats are owing HDB loan instalments now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am sorry I do not have the answer\r\n\r\nright  now.  Generally, the arrears rate for HDB  flats  in\r\n\r\ntotal  is  less  than 5%.  I do not have the breakdown  but\r\n\r\nthat  is a good indication that, by and large, most of  our\r\n\r\nHDB  flat  lessees  are able to cope  with  the  instalment\r\n\r\npayments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I would like to confirm with\r\n\r\nthe  Minister that, based on his statement, if  a  mortgage\r\n\r\npayment ranges from 20-40% of his income, he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  consider it as affordable. Secondly,  since  we  are\r\n\r\ncurrently  paying 20%, if the mortgage loan increases,  let\r\n\r\nus  say,  to 40%, is it still considered affordable  for  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean to own a HDB flat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Yes, that is correct. The reason why\r\n\r\nwe  use  40%  is  because  this is  the  standard  industry\r\n\r\npractice,  that  is, one would be considered  credit-worthy\r\n\r\nfor  a loan if he does not have to pay more than 40% of his\r\n\r\nhousehold income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nuncertain   economic   climate   and   the   increase    in\r\n\r\nretrenchments,  would  the  demand  for  rental  flats   be\r\n\r\nincreasing,  and  is there an increasing  supply  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to look into for people who want to rent  a  flat\r\n\r\ninstead  of  purchasing?  Another question  relates  to  an\r\n\r\narticle   that  appeared  recently  about  a  woman   whose\r\n\r\napplication  for  a  rental flat was rejected  because  her\r\n\r\nchild was born out of wedlock.  Why was her case for rental\r\n\r\nof a flat not approved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The first question was concerning the\r\n\r\nsupply  of rental flats. The rental flat scheme run by  the\r\n\r\nHDB is not contingent upon how many people want to rent the\r\n\r\nflats.   There are certain very strict eligibility criteria\r\n\r\nfor  those  who  wish  to rent from  HDB.   There  are  two\r\n\r\nreasons.   One  is  that  it is a very  heavily  subsidised\r\n\r\nscheme  and therefore we have to make sure that eligibility\r\n\r\nfor   such  flats  is  tightly  controlled.  Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has always said that we want to encourage  home\r\n\r\nownership.  We want to encourage home ownership because  it\r\n\r\ngives Singaporeans a stake. We also want to encourage  home\r\n\r\nownership  because, as opposed to rental,  people  do  take\r\n\r\nbetter  care of their flats and they have better commitment\r\n\r\nto the flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, the eligibility criteria under the\r\n\r\nrental scheme, or what we call the Public Scheme, are  kept\r\n\r\nvery tight.  When people want to rent a flat - if they  are\r\n\r\nretrenched,  etc  - and they approach HDB,  they  would  be\r\n\r\nasked   several  questions.   One,  what  is  their  income\r\n\r\nceiling;  two, whether they have a family unit; and  three,\r\n\r\nwhether they have actually enjoyed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHDB  subsidies before.  For example, if they have just sold\r\n\r\na  flat,  they have to wait for 30 months before  they  are\r\n\r\nallowed to rent.  So there are several criteria before they\r\n\r\ncan  be  eligible to rent a flat.  It is not  a  matter  of\r\n\r\ndemand  for  rental flats and HDB striving to satisfy  that\r\n\r\ndemand.  It is not on that basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is regarding this specific case.\r\n\r\nI  do  not  have the details of the case but I  can  answer\r\n\r\ngenerally  by  saying  that one of the  criteria,  which  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier  for renting of a  HDB  flat  under  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Scheme, is that the applicant must  form  a  family\r\n\r\nnucleus.  A family nucleus is defined as either one  parent\r\n\r\nand  one  child (at least two persons), husband  and  wife,\r\n\r\nparent  and  child,  etc.  For the  case  that  the  Member\r\n\r\nmentioned, which is regarding a parent and a child  who  is\r\n\r\nborn  out  of  wedlock, HDB does not recognise  that  as  a\r\n\r\nfamily unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR BUANGKOK STATION AREA</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  (a)  if he will give the number  of  completed\r\n\r\nresidential  blocks within a 600-metre radius  of  Buangkok\r\n\r\nStation and (b) what are the development plans for the area\r\n\r\nand when will these developments commence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, there are 58 completed HDB\r\n\r\nresidential blocks comprising 4,720 flats that are within a\r\n\r\nstraight-line distance of 600 metres from the Buangkok  MRT\r\n\r\nstation.

Members may wish to know that in the  recent\r\n\r\nbus  rationalisation exercise arising from the start of NEL\r\n\r\noperations,  PTC  did  intervene  to  modify  some  of  the\r\n\r\nproposals.  This was to reduce the negative impact on  some\r\n\r\nof  the  commuters  who  were  adversely  affected  by  the\r\n\r\nexercise.   This is because while the introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nNEL  has  brought substantial benefits to the vast majority\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans living along the north-east sector, it  is\r\n\r\nunavoidable that a small number of commuters would still be\r\n\r\naffected  in terms of longer travel times or higher  costs.\r\n\r\nI  can  understand the unhappiness of those who  have  been\r\n\r\nadversely impacted, and I have asked LTA and PTC to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  SBS  Transit is providing commuters on  the  affected\r\n\r\nroutes with good alternative services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Phua asked why feedback from residents and\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders was not obtained before the decision  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw the essential bus trunk services.  Sir, I am  sure\r\n\r\nthat TransitLink and the operator would like to do this, if\r\n\r\nit  was  indeed feasible.  However, the rationalisation  of\r\n\r\nbus  services  must  be evaluated on a  system-wide  level,\r\n\r\nrather  than  based on individual preferences or  feedback.\r\n\r\nThe practice is for the operator to discuss with grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  and Advisors, after the rationalisation  has  been\r\n\r\ndecided on, in order to fine-tune the changes at the  local\r\n\r\nlevel.   I  understand this was, in fact, done  last  week.\r\n\r\nBased on the feedback received, the bus operator is looking\r\n\r\ninto  fine-tuning the integration of bus services with  the\r\n\r\nNEL.   In  fact, I understand that it has already  improved\r\n\r\nthe  capacity on several routes and commuters are now quite\r\n\r\nhappy with the services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Phua asked why more time was not given to affected\r\n\r\ncommuters to find alternative transport.  I understand that\r\n\r\nSBS Transit waited about one month\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafter the start of the NEL service before carrying out  the\r\n\r\nbus  rationalisation.  It had also given more than a week's\r\n\r\nnotice  on the rationalisation of the affected bus  routes.\r\n\r\nFrom past experience, this has proven to be sufficient time\r\n\r\nfor  commuters to get used to the new system  and  the  new\r\n\r\nroutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by reiterating to Members that\r\n\r\nthe  bus  rationalisation  exercise  is  an  important  and\r\n\r\nintegral  part of the commissioning of any new train  line.\r\n\r\nIt  helps to reduce wasteful duplication, and helps to keep\r\n\r\nour  public  transport system affordable.   Many  commuters\r\n\r\nhave  benefited from the completion of the NEL  line.   The\r\n\r\ncommuting  experience  for  many  Singaporeans   has   been\r\n\r\ntransformed largely for the better.  However, I  appreciate\r\n\r\nthat  any  rationalisation exercise can never be  pain-free\r\n\r\nand  some commuters would invariably be adversely affected.\r\n\r\nThe transport operator has tried to minimise the number  of\r\n\r\ncommuters who are inconvenienced, and I can assure  Members\r\n\r\nthat  the PTC and LTA will work with SBS Transit to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the needs of this group are looked after as  best  as\r\n\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua:</b> Sir, four supplementary questions.\r\n\r\nCan the Minister share the study of the travel pattern with\r\n\r\nthe  ground?   And, just to clarify, the Advisors  actually\r\n\r\nasked  for  the  dialogue  before  the  dialogue  with  the\r\n\r\nresidents was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is: as MOT pushes for the\r\n\r\nintegration  of the bus and train services,  what  are  the\r\n\r\nprinciples and guidelines MOT adopted for this integration?\r\n\r\nWhy was the concession of the bus and MRT fare services for\r\n\r\nthe  school  children not integrated?  With the removal  of\r\n\r\nthe  many  bus trunk services, the children are  forced  to\r\n\r\ntake  buses  to the MRT station itself and they  would  now\r\n\r\nneed  to take both bus service and MRT to their school  and\r\n\r\nthey have to pay an additional $45 or $52 more depending on\r\n\r\nwhat  card they hold.  This is a 100% increase in the fare.\r\n\r\nWould  the  Minister  help these poor  children  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies by providing a cheaper integrated fare?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on the principles of integration, why is SBS\r\n\r\nTransit  allowed to retain the services of 502 from Orchard\r\n\r\nto  Jurong East, which is on the SMRT line, and removed the\r\n\r\nservice from Hougang to Orchard which is on the North  East\r\n\r\nLine?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last question: what is the relationship between\r\n\r\nLTA,  PTC  and TransitLink Private Limited and their  roles\r\n\r\nand  decision for the removal of the bus services  and  the\r\n\r\nrationalisation  of the MRT line and the bus  services?   I\r\n\r\nask this question because this company sent out letters  to\r\n\r\nthe  Advisors  for  a briefing but not  the  operator,  SBS\r\n\r\nTransit Limited, or the relevant authorities like MOT,  LTA\r\n\r\nor PTC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Mdm Phua wants the study to be\r\n\r\nshared.   Sir, I understand the study is based on the  fare\r\n\r\npayments  that are made by commuters along  the  route.   I\r\n\r\nwill ask SBS to see whether they can simplify the study and\r\n\r\nshare it with the Advisors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is the integration of the bus and\r\n\r\ntrain  services.  What are the principles related to  that?\r\n\r\nShe also asked about the concession tickets for the bus and\r\n\r\ntrain  services for our students.  Sir, the integration  of\r\n\r\nthe  bus  and train services is on the basis that since  we\r\n\r\nhave  the  train  line and the stations  defined,  the  bus\r\n\r\nservices  would  then integrate with the  train  system  by\r\n\r\nensuring  that  the  commuters  living  around  the   train\r\n\r\nstations  are  conveyed  to the  train  stations  that  are\r\n\r\nnearest  to them.  This has been the principle adopted  for\r\n\r\nthe  existing  MRT systems when they were  implemented  and\r\n\r\nthis same principle has been adopted for the integration of\r\n\r\nthe NEL line and the bus routes along the NEL line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked about the impact on the students who\r\n\r\nare now required to travel by both bus and train.  Sir, the\r\n\r\nneed  to  travel on both bus and train is already something\r\n\r\nwhich is being experienced even before the start of the NEL\r\n\r\nline  because  students living in other parts of  Singapore\r\n\r\nmay  have to travel on both feeder bus and the train system\r\n\r\nin  order to get to school.  However, I think the situation\r\n\r\nwith regard to the NEL line is that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  students  now may have to travel short  distances  on\r\n\r\nboth  the bus and train and therefore if they have  to  get\r\n\r\ntwo  concession tickets, one for the bus and  one  for  the\r\n\r\ntrain,  which  is the current system, they  end  up  paying\r\n\r\ndouble.   We have, in fact, asked TransitLink to work  with\r\n\r\nthe bus and train operators to see whether they can come up\r\n\r\nwith  an  integrated bus and train concession ticket  which\r\n\r\nshould then meet the needs of those people who only need to\r\n\r\ntravel a short distance on both the bus and the train.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question was how is it that SBS was allowed\r\n\r\nto  retain  Service  502 from Jurong East  to  Orchard.   I\r\n\r\nunderstand that whilst it serves the two stations, it  also\r\n\r\nserves  parts  that do not lie within the train  line  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  it was justified by SBS that that  section  was\r\n\r\nstill needed.  However, the part that ran from Orchard  all\r\n\r\nthe  way  to  the north eastern part pretty much duplicated\r\n\r\nthe  NEL  line  and  that is why SBS took  out  that  part.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I have asked LTA to work with PTC and the  bus\r\n\r\noperator to ensure that those people who have been affected\r\n\r\nby  the removal of the express bus services should be given\r\n\r\ngood  alternative feeder services so that they can link  up\r\n\r\nto  the  nearest  NEL  station in as convenient  a  way  as\r\n\r\npossible.  I understand that SBS has replied that they  are\r\n\r\nindeed  looking  into it and that, if need  be,  they  will\r\n\r\nincrease  the number of buses and frequencies to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat those commuters who are affected do indeed have a good\r\n\r\nalternative service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her last question was the relationship between\r\n\r\nTransitLink  and SBS Transit and why is it that TransitLink\r\n\r\nwas  involved in the communication process rather than SBS.\r\n\r\nSir, TransitLink is a company that is jointly owned by  the\r\n\r\noperators  and  it  is  in charge of coordinating  the  bus\r\n\r\nroutes and payment system for the rail and bus service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why they were involved in the dialogue session\r\n\r\nin  terms of explaining the bus rationalisation, I think it\r\n\r\nwas  worked out between SBS and TransitLink as to who would\r\n\r\ntake  responsibility  for which part of  the  communication\r\n\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to why the Ministry was not involved, we are involved in\r\n\r\nterms  of  keeping a watching brief on what has transpired,\r\n\r\nand to make sure that the communication process is actually\r\n\r\ntaking place.  We are not involved directly in the briefing\r\n\r\nto  the  grassroots or the public.  We have left it to  the\r\n\r\noperators because they are the ones most familiar with  the\r\n\r\nrationale for the changes and to explain their future plans\r\n\r\nto  the  dialogue  partners.  So we have left  it  to  both\r\n\r\nTransitLink and SBS to manage the dialogue session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mdm Phua that arising from the\r\n\r\nrecent dialogue, I have instructed the staff to ensure that\r\n\r\nit  is not just the mechanics of the dialogue, but to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  the preparations for the dialogue are  properly\r\n\r\ndone,  so  that the dialogue can be done in  a  timely  and\r\n\r\nproductive manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, first, with\r\n\r\nregard to the study on travel patterns, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to submit the study to the PTC.  Second,  who\r\n\r\ncommissioned  the  study and how does the  PTC  verify  the\r\n\r\nreport?   Third, after integration of services,  presumably\r\n\r\nbased  on the report, will there be any monitoring  of  the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of the integration, and for  how  long  will\r\n\r\nsuch  monitoring  take  place?   The  reason  I  ask  these\r\n\r\nquestions is because I have a staff who says that residents\r\n\r\nin  the Jalan Besar area are very badly affected due to the\r\n\r\nintegration  of services.  As a result of the  integration,\r\n\r\nonly two services are available from Jalan Besar to Shenton\r\n\r\nWay, and they are very packed in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, SBS and TransitLink do indeed\r\n\r\nengage  a consultant to do the study, because the study  of\r\n\r\nroute  planning is actually a very specialised area.   What\r\n\r\nthe  experts do is to mine the data available from the fare\r\n\r\npayment  system,  so  that  they  know  exactly  how   many\r\n\r\npassengers  got up in one area, how much they  paid,  which\r\n\r\nwill tell them roughly where they had gone through.  So all\r\n\r\nthis  data mining is done by the consultants, and from this\r\n\r\noutcome, they will then have a fair picture of what are the\r\n\r\nkey travel patterns.  And from there, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  then do their route planning as to how the new  routes\r\n\r\nshould be structured, and what sort of feeder services  are\r\n\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, this has worked out very well over the past\r\n\r\n15  years  or  so since we had the MRT system  and  had  to\r\n\r\nrationalise  the bus routes.  What we have  found  is  that\r\n\r\nwhat  is  needed  often is just fine-tuning  at  the  local\r\n\r\nlevel.   This is normally done along the entire stretch  of\r\n\r\nareas  affected by the bus rationalisation.   I can  assure\r\n\r\nDr  Amy  Khor  that if Jalan Besar is also affected,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure, in due course, they will also ensure that a review is\r\n\r\ndone  along  the  Jalan Besar area and, if necessary,  more\r\n\r\nbuses will be put there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  the NEL and the integration  of  the  bus\r\n\r\nservices  is  supposed  to either  reduce  cost  of  public\r\n\r\ntransport  or  to  perhaps make it  easier  for  people  to\r\n\r\ntravel.   I  would  like  to ask the  Minister  whether  he\r\n\r\nconsiders this as integration or disintegration of services\r\n\r\nbecause  they  have removed some of the bus  services  like\r\n\r\nService 501 which provides an express service from Sengkang\r\n\r\nTown  to Orchard Road where a single bus service would have\r\n\r\ntaken  a person there.  Now, with these changes, they  have\r\n\r\nto  take a bus to the MRT station, drop off at another  MRT\r\n\r\nstation, and then take another bus again.  So they  end  up\r\n\r\nnot  saving  but spending more time travelling.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nin  this  whole  exercise, I am not  sure  whether  it  has\r\n\r\nactually  caused integration or disintegration of services.\r\n\r\nCould  the Minister ask SBS to try to restore some of these\r\n\r\nservices?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I disagree with what the Minister said just now\r\n\r\nabout certain bus routes duplicating the SMRT line and they\r\n\r\npreserved certain routes because there were some additional\r\n\r\nbenefits.   If  he had the time to look at the  bus  routes\r\n\r\nmore  carefully, he would have noticed that  a  route  like\r\n\r\n501, which is an express service, the distance between  the\r\n\r\nNEL  and  the  bus route that is operating is much  further\r\n\r\nthan  what  this so-called Service 502 duplication  of  the\r\n\r\nSMRT line.  This is really not a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  convincing  argument.  I think  the  real  reason  is\r\n\r\nbecause  the NEL and SBS are operating the same  line,  and\r\n\r\nSMRT  and SBS are competitors and that is why they retained\r\n\r\nthe second half and omitted the first half.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Dr Michael Lim asked whether\r\n\r\nNEL was meant to reduce the cost of public transport.  If I\r\n\r\nrecall,  I was sitting here when Minister Mah Bow  Tan  was\r\n\r\ntalking  about NEL, and he stressed the fact that  the  NEL\r\n\r\nline  is  going to be an expensive line and that  commuters\r\n\r\nalong  the North East sector have to pay a premium for  the\r\n\r\nNEL  service.  So, we never promised that NEL is  going  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  cost  of transport down and that  it  would  be\r\n\r\ncheaper  than  the  existing form of  transport.   But  the\r\n\r\nadvantage   of   NEL  is  that  commuters  will   now   get\r\n\r\npredictability  of  travel time, and I think  this  is  the\r\n\r\nbiggest convenience offered by any train system.  Commuters\r\n\r\ndo  not  have traffic jams to worry about.  They know  that\r\n\r\nthe  train  is  going to arrive during peak periods,  maybe\r\n\r\nwithin 5 minutes maximum time interval, which means that if\r\n\r\nthey are unlucky and arrive at the platform just after  the\r\n\r\ntrain  pulls  out, they only have to wait a predictable  5- 5 1/2  minutes.  Whereas if they are waiting for a bus, they\r\n\r\nnever  know  when the bus is going to arrive.  The  headway\r\n\r\nmay  be  7 minutes but there could be a traffic jam  or  an\r\n\r\naccident,   and   the  bus  could  be  delayed.    So   the\r\n\r\npredictability of time travel is a very important fact  and\r\n\r\nI  think that has been the feedback we are getting from the\r\n\r\nhappy  commuters who have been taking the NEL.   At  least,\r\n\r\nnow  they know when they can leave their home and when they\r\n\r\nare  going to arrive in the office.  And quite often,  they\r\n\r\nend  the day with extra time because the overall travelling\r\n\r\ntime  has  been reduced.  Of course, as I said earlier  on,\r\n\r\nwhilst  the vast majority would have benefited, there  will\r\n\r\nbe   pockets  of  people  who  would  have  been  adversely\r\n\r\naffected.  I think this is unavoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the express bus services, they were put\r\n\r\nin  place  because there was no NEL in the  past.   So  the\r\n\r\nexpress bus services were really in lieu of the NEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow  that  the  NEL system is operational,  the  logic  for\r\n\r\nhaving  the  express  bus service in  the  area  no  longer\r\n\r\nexists, and that is why they were removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why express bus Service 502 was retained because\r\n\r\nit belonged to SBS while the train system there belonged to\r\n\r\nSMRT,  we  have left it to PTC to review.

We\r\n\r\nreceived 101 suggestions as to where the bus routes  should\r\n\r\nrun, depending on where they and their relatives worked and\r\n\r\nlived.

It  has  to  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  actual travel  patterns  of  groups  of\r\n\r\npeople, not in terms of asking individuals where they work,\r\n\r\nbecause  that would not tell you very much at  all,  unless\r\n\r\nyou  can  ask  everybody who is living  in  that  area.   A\r\n\r\ndialogue  session  does not really give outcomes  that  are\r\n\r\nvery  usable, but local refinements are useful and  needed,\r\n\r\nand  that is where the local dialogue is most useful.   And\r\n\r\nthis  has been the pattern that we have been adopting since\r\n\r\nday  one  in  terms of bus rationalisation, and  they  have\r\n\r\nworked quite well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, when can we expect\r\n\r\nthe  integration of bus fare and train fare concession  for\r\n\r\nstudents to be completed and materialised?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I do not have a deadline for\r\n\r\nthat.

Since Buangkok Station\r\n\r\nhas  not been opened, LTA has ensured that residents in the\r\n\r\narea  are adequately served by buses.  They can also access\r\n\r\nthe North East Line (NEL) by taking feeder buses to the two\r\n\r\nnearby stations of Sengkang and Hougang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operator for NEL was selected through a\r\n\r\ncompetitive tender.  SBS Transit won the competitive tender\r\n\r\nin  1999  based  on  the merits of its technical  proposal.\r\n\r\nThere  are advantages to having the same operator run  both\r\n\r\nbus and train services.  For one, it allows the operator to\r\n\r\nbetter  integrate both the bus and train services  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  commuters.  Feeder bus routes  can  be  better\r\n\r\nplanned, and the first and last bus and train schedules can\r\n\r\nbe  better  coordinated.  Re-routing  and  bringing  on  of\r\n\r\nadditional  bus  services in the event of  a  breakdown  in\r\n\r\ntrain services can also be better managed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though SBS Transit operates both the buses and\r\n\r\nthe train along the North East corridor, it does not have a\r\n\r\nfree hand in deciding on the bus rationalisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npackage.  It  had  to  submit its proposal  to  the  Public\r\n\r\nTransport  Council (PTC) for approval.  The PTC  considered\r\n\r\nthe   overall  operational  efficiency  of  the   transport\r\n\r\nnetwork, as well as the impact on commuters.  This  process\r\n\r\nis  the  same, whether or not the operator of the train  is\r\n\r\nalso the operator of the buses in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong asked about the cost of keeping Buangkok\r\n\r\nStation closed.  The annual depreciation charge on Buangkok\r\n\r\nStation  is  about $3 million.  This is incurred regardless\r\n\r\nof  whether it is open or not.  However, if the station  is\r\n\r\nopened,  the  operator  will incur an additional  operating\r\n\r\nloss of about $1 million annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chong also asked if a study has been done to\r\n\r\nascertain if SBS Transit can operate the NEL viably without\r\n\r\nraising  fares  and  closing down more  stations.   Let  me\r\n\r\nassure the Member that SBS Transit would not be allowed  to\r\n\r\nclose any other stations on the NEL.  Unlike Woodleigh  and\r\n\r\nBuangkok stations, all the other NEL stations are essential\r\n\r\nfor serving the developments around them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Government decided to proceed with the\r\n\r\nconstruction   of   NEL,   LTA  had   conducted   extensive\r\n\r\nfeasibility  studies to ascertain that the  line  would  be\r\n\r\nboth economically and financially viable over the medium to\r\n\r\nlong   term.   Although  the  NEL  is  incurring  operating\r\n\r\ndeficits in the initial years, the prospects over the  long\r\n\r\nterm are positive as more developments are completed in the\r\n\r\nnorth-eastern parts of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the Minister\r\n\r\ntell  us whether PTC was aware that Buangkok Station  would\r\n\r\nbe  closed  before  it approved the fare structure  by  the\r\n\r\noperator?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, unfortunately SBS failed to\r\n\r\ninform PTC of this fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Would PTC now review the fares in\r\n\r\nview of the knowledge that Buangkok Station is now closed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the fact that Buangkok\r\n\r\nStation is closed makes no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifference to the fares.  Because if PTC's job is to ensure\r\n\r\nthe viability of the operator, then it should be increasing\r\n\r\nthe fares.  So, as it is now, the NEL is incurring a fairly\r\n\r\nlarge  deficit.  By closing Buangkok Station, it  has  made\r\n\r\nthe  deficit a little bit smaller.  That is all.   It  does\r\n\r\nnot make the line any more viable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Can the Minister clarify\r\n\r\nthe  process so that we will be a bit more enlightened?   I\r\n\r\nwould  have  thought that when SBS was given the commercial\r\n\r\nright  to operate the NEL and they had gone before  PTC  to\r\n\r\nget  approval  for  the  set of  fares,  those  fares  were\r\n\r\napproved  on  the  basis that the NEL operator  would  only\r\n\r\nclose  the Woodleigh Station.  So, I am just wondering,  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  the principle, whether it is proper, having  had\r\n\r\nthe  set  of fares approved on the basis of the closure  of\r\n\r\none  station,  to close subsequent stations.   That  is  my\r\n\r\nfirst question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is this. The MPs had heard some\r\n\r\nrumours  about the closure of Buangkok Station and  we  had\r\n\r\nwritten  to SBS to seek confirmation in late March only  to\r\n\r\nget a reply that Buangkok Station would be opened.  And  to\r\n\r\nour  aghast  and  horror,  we were informed  that  Buangkok\r\n\r\nStation  was not going to be opened just a few days  before\r\n\r\nthe  opening.  Was there any reason why SBS could not  have\r\n\r\ninformed the MPs earlier that the station was not going  to\r\n\r\nbe  opened?  Obviously, if there were rumours on the ground\r\n\r\nthat  this  was not going to be so, they might  have  known\r\n\r\neven at the point of time when they called the MPs down for\r\n\r\na  briefing on the NEL stations.  So, why did they not  let\r\n\r\nus know at that point in time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the PTC approved the fares on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of what SBS had submitted to the PTC.  In actual\r\n\r\nfact,  SBS  had submitted a request for much  higher  fares\r\n\r\nwhich the PTC felt should be reduced, because PTC wanted to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the fare premium on the NEL  was  kept  to  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  limit  of not more than  25  cents.   Yes,  SBS\r\n\r\nshould  have  gone back to PTC to inform PTC  that  it  had\r\n\r\ndecided not to open Buangkok Station\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  that LTA, as a regulator, had approved its application\r\n\r\nto keep Buangkok Station closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should they now go back to PTC? I do not think it\r\n\r\nwould  serve much purpose at the present moment.   Because,\r\n\r\nas  I  said, the NEL is already not viable in terms of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  operating expenses and revenues.  They are  losing\r\n\r\nmoney  and  incurring a deficit.  I do not think  that  PTC\r\n\r\nwould  make  any changes to the fares because  of  that  $1\r\n\r\nmillion reduction in its losses.  So, it is a moot point as\r\n\r\nto  whether it makes any difference if SBS had gone back to\r\n\r\nPTC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about SBS having informed the\r\n\r\ngrassroots  leaders that Buangkok Station was going  to  be\r\n\r\nopened  and subsequently not informing them about a  change\r\n\r\nof  plans.   Sir, I agree with Dr Michael Lim  that  having\r\n\r\ninformed  the  Adviser  and  the grassroots  that  Buangkok\r\n\r\nStation  was going to be opened, SBS should have gone  back\r\n\r\nto  them early to inform them that there had been a  change\r\n\r\nof plans.  We had, in fact, told SBS that what they did was\r\n\r\nwrong  and  they should not do such a thing  again  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\ngetting a bit confused here.  I am trying to understand the\r\n\r\nprocess.  Can I check with the Minister?  Does it mean that\r\n\r\nan operator can seek approval from PTC and PTC, based on  a\r\n\r\ncertain  set of criteria, has approved the routes  or  what\r\n\r\nthey  are supposed to do, and then the operator can  decide\r\n\r\nnot  to follow what PTC has agreed upon?  Then, I am a  bit\r\n\r\nconfused  about the whole decision process.  Does  it  mean\r\n\r\nthat  the  operator can seek PTC's approval of  routes  and\r\n\r\nthen  after that disregard PTC's decision?  If that is  so,\r\n\r\nunder what circumstances can they do that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, for the bus system, PTC is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for both the routes and the  fares.   For  the\r\n\r\ntrain, it is a little bit more complicated.  For the train,\r\n\r\nthe  opening  of  stations  is under  the  control  of  the\r\n\r\nregulator  which,  in  this case,  is  LTA.   PTC  is  only\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the fares that are to be established  for\r\n\r\ntravel along the NEL system.  And that is why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  think  there was a bit of confusion there.  I understand\r\n\r\nthat   SBS   thought  that  since  LTA  had  approved   the\r\n\r\napplication not to open Buangkok Station, that was the  end\r\n\r\nof  it.  So there was some genuine confusion on the part of\r\n\r\nSBS  as  to whether or not they needed to go back  to  PTC,\r\n\r\nwhich is why, as it turned out, they proceeded on the basis\r\n\r\nof obtaining approval of LTA, and did not go back to PTC to\r\n\r\ninform  PTC  that  there  was a change  in  the  number  of\r\n\r\nstations that were to be opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one thing\r\n\r\nI  do  not  understand.  If the NEL is  not  viable  to  be\r\n\r\noperated  in spite of the high prices, why is SBS operating\r\n\r\nthe  line?  Why did they tender for the line?  And why  did\r\n\r\nthe  Government award this operation to SBS  in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with the benefit of hindsight now, would it\r\n\r\nnot  have  been better off if the NEL had been operated  by\r\n\r\nSMRT which would then be able to enjoy better economies  of\r\n\r\nscale  which it now has, and thereby resulting in a  better\r\n\r\npricing structure for all commuters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, as I mentioned in my initial\r\n\r\nanswer,  the  NEL is viable over the medium to  long  term.\r\n\r\nToday, it is running a deficit because the developments  in\r\n\r\nthe   north-eastern  part  have  been  a  lot  slower  than\r\n\r\noriginally projected when the decision was made to  proceed\r\n\r\nwith  NEL.   As explained by Minister Mah, because  of  the\r\n\r\nslowdown  in demand for flats, the building programmes  for\r\n\r\nSengkang  and  Punggol  have had to be  scaled  back  quite\r\n\r\nsignificantly.   In  fact  anyone who  visits  Punggol  and\r\n\r\nSengkang will see huge plots of land that have been cleared\r\n\r\nobviously for very quick startup of building but which  has\r\n\r\nhad to be held back because of the slowdown in demand.  So,\r\n\r\nif   the  demand  had  taken  place  or  had  developed  as\r\n\r\noriginally  anticipated in the early 1990s,  then  the  NEL\r\n\r\nwould have been viable fairly quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to why SBS took on the job of running NEL,\r\n\r\nobviously it took on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njob because it was looking more at the medium to long term.\r\n\r\nIn  the initial stages, it may have run a loss as with  any\r\n\r\nnew  system,  but  over the long term it  is  going  to  be\r\n\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hindsight, should we have allowed for only one\r\n\r\noperator instead of two?  Sir, when the policy was made  to\r\n\r\nintroduce a second operator, it was felt that it would give\r\n\r\nus  a chance to compare the two operators and from the  two\r\n\r\nseparate  operations, perhaps to be able to  get  ideas  on\r\n\r\nwhere  improvements  can be made to the  operations.   This\r\n\r\nway,  whilst they were not competing directly in  terms  of\r\n\r\nserving the same area, they could compete in terms  of  how\r\n\r\nto  better  manage  each  of  their  lines,  and  from  the\r\n\r\ncompetition  we  could  then  perhaps  share  the   lessons\r\n\r\nlearned.  I think that philosophy is still valid.  Now that\r\n\r\nwe  have  two  listed companies running the two  lines,  we\r\n\r\nleave  it  to the two companies to decide as to whether  it\r\n\r\nshould be operated by one or two companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, can the Minister\r\n\r\nconfirm  this?

With  that  in\r\n\r\nmind, should we not try to compel SBS to look at the longer\r\n\r\nterm  gain  that  they  are going to  get  and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nsubsidise all the bus routes, the Buangkok Station  and  so\r\n\r\non?   In  fact,  the  Government has  already  written  off\r\n\r\nbillions of dollars on this line.

From the statistics, about  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  150  buses had been saved.  Has  that  made  the\r\n\r\noverall  operation more economic?  I think, yes.  The  fact\r\n\r\nthat  they are able to save 150 buses means that they  have\r\n\r\nbeen able to keep the deficit within control.

It is here where we will find some of\r\n\r\nthe answers that account for our present predicament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030814/20030814-HA-0762449.htm\">Table   1   -   Employment Change, 1993-1997 and 1999-2002 (Cols. 2449-2450)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030814/20030814-HA-0762451.htm\">Table   2   -   Employment Change  by  Sector,  1993-1997 and 1998-2002  (Cols.  2451-2452)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 1 shows that in the earlier period from 1993 to\r\n\r\n1997,   almost  475,000  jobs  were  created.   Of   these,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  took  up about 185,000  and  foreigners,  the\r\n\r\nremaining  290,000.   Note that  in  this  period  of  high\r\n\r\neconomic growth and job creation, more jobs - 60% - went to\r\n\r\nforeigners  than  Singaporeans.  But very few  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncomplained  then because locals found jobs easily  and  the\r\n\r\nforeign workers helped us meet the labour demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the later period from 1998 to 2002, about 102,000\r\n\r\njobs were created.  93,000 of these jobs went to residents,\r\n\r\nand   only  9,000  to  foreigners.   So  the  ratio  of   9\r\n\r\nSingaporean  to  1  foreigner  is  statistically   correct.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  we  compare the number of  jobs  created  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in the two periods, only half as many new jobs\r\n\r\nwere  created in the later period for Singaporeans compared\r\n\r\nto  the  earlier  period - 185,000 versus  93,000.   I  can\r\n\r\ntherefore well understand, as many of the Members  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse   have   told   me,  the  sentiment   of   retrenched\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who find no comfort in the 9 to 1 ratio.  In\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfact,  many of them do not even bother what the  ratio  is.\r\n\r\nEvery Singaporean knows that the job market is tougher than\r\n\r\nbefore  and,  with  the recent spate of  retrenchments,  is\r\n\r\nrightly concerned about his job security.  He also wants to\r\n\r\nknow  why  we allow foreign workers here when our  resident\r\n\r\nunemployment rates have reached 5%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are their concerns and let me now address these\r\n\r\nmore  important  concerns.  Why is the job market  tougher?\r\n\r\nAs  Members should have realised from comparing  these  two\r\n\r\nperiods,  it  is  ultimately  job  creation  which  reduces\r\n\r\nunemployment.  We are feeling pain because not enough  jobs\r\n\r\nwere  created in the last five years.  The ratio of foreign\r\n\r\nto  local workers is unimportant when enough jobs have been\r\n\r\ncreated.    We  have  about  35,000  additional   residents\r\n\r\nentering  into our labour force every year.  From  1993  to\r\n\r\n1997,  there were about 100,000 jobs on average every year.\r\n\r\nSo  in  fact,  it was a grand `job buffet'  as  we  created\r\n\r\nnearly three jobs for every Singaporean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1993 to 1997, Singaporeans could pick and choose\r\n\r\nthe  type  of  job they liked.  As they could, indeed  they\r\n\r\ndid.   So as Table 2 indicates, they declined jobs  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction,  marine, domestic, cleaning, kitchen,  hotels\r\n\r\nand  even  manufacturing  sectors.  Singaporeans  basically\r\n\r\nsaid no to hot or difficult jobs, those that had 12 hour or\r\n\r\nnight  shifts, those that required you to commute too  far,\r\n\r\netc.   It  was a natural reaction and the luxury  we  could\r\n\r\nafford  in  a time of plenty.  Instead they chose  to  move\r\n\r\ninto  the  services industry where working conditions  were\r\n\r\nmore  manageable.  It was a logical choice for some.   Very\r\n\r\nfew complained when employers who needed the manpower hired\r\n\r\nforeign  workers to fill up those jobs that  they  did  not\r\n\r\nwant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you look at the number beginning in Table 1,\r\n\r\nfrom  1993 to 1997, the number of foreign workers  in  fact\r\n\r\nnearly doubled, but very few complained.  But 1998 to  2002\r\n\r\nwere difficult years.  Skilled workers from China and India\r\n\r\nentered the global market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Asian financial crisis, September 11 and the Bali bomb\r\n\r\nblast  took  their  toll.  In Singapore,  fewer  jobs  were\r\n\r\ncreated than the new entrants added into the workforce each\r\n\r\nyear.   So instead of 100,000 jobs created each year,  only\r\n\r\nabout  18,000 jobs were created.  Instead of the  luxurious\r\n\r\nspread,  fewer and less appealing dishes were  now  on  the\r\n\r\nbuffet table.  As a result, many foreign workers went home,\r\n\r\nespecially from the construction and manufacturing sectors.\r\n\r\nOnly in services did foreign worker numbers go up, and many\r\n\r\nof  these were domestic maids.  Hence, Table 1 shows a  net\r\n\r\nincrease  of  only 8,900 foreign workers  over  these  five\r\n\r\nyears  as compared to the preceding five years where  there\r\n\r\nwas  an  increase  in  291,000 foreign workers,  ie,  9,000\r\n\r\ncompared to 291,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But note that, despite fewer jobs being created during\r\n\r\n1998  to  2002,  Singaporeans  continued  to  move  out  of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing.   The  service industry was  still  creating\r\n\r\njobs  but  not enough to absorb everyone.  So the  resident\r\n\r\nunemployment rate rose.  Singaporeans had not shaken  their\r\n\r\nattitudes shaped by years of plentiful jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we solve the current problem of unemployment?\r\n\r\nFirst,  we  need  to  get the economy growing  again.   New\r\n\r\ninvestments  will create new jobs, and expand the  economic\r\n\r\npie for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we must emphasise training and skills\r\n\r\nupgrading,  to enable our workers to do the jobs  that  are\r\n\r\navailable and to hold their own against the competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we need to free up the labour market, by\r\n\r\nreforming the wage system and retuning the CPF system.  Our\r\n\r\nfixed,   seniority  based  wages  are  a   rigidity   which\r\n\r\ndiscourages employers from hiring older workers.   The  CPF\r\n\r\nsystem achieves important social objectives, but its burden\r\n\r\nmust  be kept as light as possible so that it does not make\r\n\r\nour workers uncompetitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we must get Singaporeans to take up the jobs\r\n\r\nwhich  foreigners  are doing, including in  the  industries\r\n\r\nwhich they previously avoided.  In other words,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen the buffet table has less appealing dishes, we have to\r\n\r\nencourage   them  to  eat  them  because  they  are   still\r\n\r\nnutritious even though they are less appealing.  Foreigners\r\n\r\nform  about  a quarter of our workforce.  There are  around\r\n\r\n200,000  jobs  held by foreign work permit holders  in  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and services sector, excluding  the  140,000\r\n\r\nforeign  maids  and  the 150,000 construction  workers.   I\r\n\r\nencourage Singaporeans to take up these jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate that some of these jobs are not\r\n\r\nattractive because of lower pay or working conditions.   We\r\n\r\nhave  been working with industries to redesign jobs to help\r\n\r\nthem  make the jobs more suitable for Singaporeans.  If  we\r\n\r\ncan  increase productivity through job redesign, wages  can\r\n\r\nalso  go up.  But we have to be realistic, and Singaporeans\r\n\r\nneed to adjust to market conditions too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the Government not simply tighten up the\r\n\r\nforeign   workers   policy  to  protect   more   jobs   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?  We have already restricted the proportion of\r\n\r\nforeign workers that a company can employ, to require  each\r\n\r\ncompany  to employ a certain minimum proportion of  locals.\r\n\r\nWe do this through the mechanism of the dependency ceiling.\r\n\r\nLet  me  explain that to you.  Beyond the ceiling, even  if\r\n\r\nthe  company  is  unable to recruit Singaporeans,  we  will\r\n\r\nstill  not allow that company to hire foreign workers.   So\r\n\r\nin the services sector, the dependency ceiling is 30% which\r\n\r\nmeans  that  we require the company to hire  at  least  70%\r\n\r\nlocals.   This causes problems to many companies trying  to\r\n\r\nreduce  their cost, especially the smaller local firms,  as\r\n\r\nmany  Members here will know from their MPS cases.  But  it\r\n\r\nis  a  way  to  get the firms to try harder  to  hire  more\r\n\r\nlocals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, foreign workers are subject to the\r\n\r\nforeign  worker levy. This levy reduces the differences  in\r\n\r\nwages   between  Singaporeans  and  foreign  workers,   and\r\n\r\nattempts   to   tilt  the  playing  field  in   favour   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we lower the dependency ceiling or raise the\r\n\r\nforeign worker levy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto reduce the number of foreign workers?  Will that help us\r\n\r\nsolve unemployment?  We have not done so because this  will\r\n\r\nbe  counter-productive.  We cannot force companies to  hire\r\n\r\nmore Singaporeans by depriving them of foreign workers.  If\r\n\r\nwe  make it harder for companies to hire workers whom  they\r\n\r\nneed,  we  will  make it more difficult  for  companies  to\r\n\r\noperate  in  Singapore.   This will  discourage  them  from\r\n\r\ngrowing  their  business here.  Because  beyond  a  certain\r\n\r\npoint,  companies will relocate in order to survive -  they\r\n\r\nhave  to compete along with you - or if they are unable  to\r\n\r\nrelocate  they  will simply close down.  Our  economy  will\r\n\r\nshrink, and Singaporeans will lose even more jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the SARS crisis hit the hotel industry, they had\r\n\r\nto  reduce  cost, and manpower cost was the  first  obvious\r\n\r\ntarget.  Hotel owners quickly asked for a reduction in  the\r\n\r\nlevy.  If we had not lowered the levy because we wanted  to\r\n\r\nprotect  or reduce, in fact, encourage the foreign  workers\r\n\r\nto  go  back, the hotels could not survive, and both locals\r\n\r\nand foreigners would have lost their jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many factories, the night shift is manned almost\r\n\r\ncompletely by foreigners.  They cannot find Singaporeans to\r\n\r\nwork the night shift, despite shift allowances and resident\r\n\r\nunemployment  at about 5%.  Without foreign workers  to  do\r\n\r\nthe  night  shift,  the factories could not  be  viable  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   They  would  relocate to  Malaysia  or  China,\r\n\r\ncausing  those Singaporeans who perform the day  shift,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the engineers and technicians, also to lose  their\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other areas, the staff shortages can have even more\r\n\r\nserious repercussions.  Take nursing as an example.  If not\r\n\r\nfor  the  foreign  nurses working side by side  with  local\r\n\r\nnurses,  our  hospitals  would not  be  able  to  function.\r\n\r\nMembers would remember that during the SARS crisis, no  one\r\n\r\nwould have blamed the foreign nurses if they had chosen  to\r\n\r\nreturn to their home country.  Instead, many foreign nurses\r\n\r\nstayed and risked their lives taking care of patients  with\r\n\r\nSARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor suggested that we introduce measures such\r\n\r\nas  those in the US, where an employer can hire a foreigner\r\n\r\nonly after he has failed in his attempt to employ a local.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our dependency ceiling that we already have\r\n\r\nis  even  more stringent than what she proposes.   So  that\r\n\r\neven   if  an  employer  can  show  that  he  cannot   find\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to hire, we will not allow him to  hire  more\r\n\r\nforeigners  above  the  dependency  ceiling.  Also,  if  we\r\n\r\nrequire  employers to show that he has  failed  to  find  a\r\n\r\nlocal,  there  will be endless disputes as to  whether  the\r\n\r\ncompany  is  offering  fair terms, whether  the  wages  are\r\n\r\nadequate,   whether  the  job  seekers  are  qualified   or\r\n\r\nsuitable.   Better  for us just to impose  a  levy  on  the\r\n\r\nforeign worker.  And if the employer volunteers to pay  the\r\n\r\nlevy  and  hire  a  foreign worker,  when  he  can  hire  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean without a levy, we conclude that he has a valid\r\n\r\nreason to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countries that have tried to protect their workers by\r\n\r\nimposing  rigid  labour market policies  have  not  reduced\r\n\r\ntheir  unemployment  - in fact the contrary  occurs.   Both\r\n\r\nFrance and Germany protect their workers well but both have\r\n\r\nunemployment rates above 9%.  The same can be said for many\r\n\r\nEuropean  countries within the OECD, with  an  unemployment\r\n\r\nrate  of  8.9%.   We  have been advised  to  follow  labour\r\n\r\npolicies of Canada.  Well, Canada has an unemployment  rate\r\n\r\nof  7.8%,  so more protection does not guarantee more  jobs\r\n\r\nfor your residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Members that from time to time, we will\r\n\r\nhave  to adjust our quota and levy system to get the  right\r\n\r\nmix  within  our labour force.  But the current problem  is\r\n\r\nthat  of  demand.  As an open economy, we are dependent  on\r\n\r\nthe state of the global economy.  Jobs will return when the\r\n\r\neconomy  picks up.  They will not come from keeping foreign\r\n\r\nworkers out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I well understand the sentiments of workers who lose\r\n\r\ntheir jobs, and are faced with the problem of providing for\r\n\r\ntheir\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfamilies.  But the way to help them is to create  more  new\r\n\r\njobs  and to prepare them for the new jobs through training\r\n\r\nand skills redevelopment programmes.  We also need to focus\r\n\r\non  wage restructuring to reduce retrenchments, and on  up-skilling for employability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government is a government of Singaporeans for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  and its responsibility is  to  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nAll  our policies, including the foreign worker policy, are\r\n\r\ndirected towards the interests of Singaporeans.  We will do\r\n\r\nour  utmost to help citizens find and keep their jobs.  But\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  succeed  by shutting out foreign  workers  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.   MOM  will  give  its  full  energy   to   help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  get  jobs.   One  major  initiative  is   the\r\n\r\nWorkforce  Development Agency, whose Bill I will be  moving\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have tried to explain the reality\r\n\r\nof  the job market, because I think that is where the  real\r\n\r\nfocus  of this discussion is.  But I would like to  end  by\r\n\r\naddressing  some  questions about the comprehensiveness  of\r\n\r\nthe  labour statistics we publish.  Can I request that  the\r\n\r\nattachment  be circulated? [Copies of attachment circulated\r\n\r\nto hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our labour statistics are reliable and accurate. They\r\n\r\nfollow  International  Labour  Organisation  guidelines  on\r\n\r\nconcepts  and  definition,  access,  integrity,  data   and\r\n\r\nquality.   Singapore also subscribes to  the  International\r\n\r\nMonetary  Fund's Special Data Dissemination  Standards  for\r\n\r\nkey  data  on  unemployment and employment figures.   These\r\n\r\nstandards   cover   four  dimensions,   namely,   coverage,\r\n\r\nperiodicity  and  timeliness of the  data,  access  by  the\r\n\r\npublic, and integrity and quality of the disseminated data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody has ever cast any doubts on the veracity of our\r\n\r\nfigures.   We are ahead of many countries in the  range  of\r\n\r\nlabour  statistics  we provide regularly.   The  Government\r\n\r\nprovides  precise and accurate numbers regularly on  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  statistics  for residents.   The  quarterly  Labour\r\n\r\nMarket  Report issued by MOM gives detailed information  on\r\n\r\nthe profile\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  resident  unemployed workers and  on  retrenched  local\r\n\r\nworkers and their re-employment rates.  These are the  more\r\n\r\nimportant indices to gauge unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also published detailed information about the\r\n\r\nforeign workforce.  Indeed we do.  I refer Members to  this\r\n\r\ncirculated  addendum which is the 2000 Census Advance  Data\r\n\r\nRelease.   This release on the economic characteristics  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore resident population is publicly available and\r\n\r\ncomprehensive.   Paragraph 7 and  Table  2  of  the  Report\r\n\r\nprovide the breakdown of the labour force by residents  and\r\n\r\nforeign  workers,  and the growth of each  group  over  the\r\n\r\nperiod 1990 and 2002.  This is the correct data set for any\r\n\r\nacademic  to  obtain  the  change  in  local  and   foreign\r\n\r\nemployment  during  these years  in  each  of  the  sectors\r\n\r\nlisted, because further down there is a sectoral breakdown.\r\n\r\nSo,  you  could  derive  the numbers for  foreign  workers.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  guesswork that is required  from  this  open\r\n\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members of this House and others have called  on\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  publish still more  comprehensive  and\r\n\r\nfrequent statistics on local and foreign workers.  MOM will\r\n\r\nstudy  these  requests.  However, Members will  recall  how\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to time the issue of foreign workers can  cause\r\n\r\nfriction between us and their countries of origin,  despite\r\n\r\nthe  most  sensitive and cautious handling.  We  should  be\r\n\r\nmindful  of  this  regional context and  not  inadvertently\r\n\r\nworsen these problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the end of this controversy, if Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncan  understand  better  the  challenges  of  the  new  job\r\n\r\nenvironment,  the  new  market reality  and  the  necessary\r\n\r\nchanges  we  must  make to improve our  unemployment,  then\r\n\r\nsomething good would have resulted from this episode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Is it not more\r\n\r\naccurate  to reflect the actual number of new jobs  created\r\n\r\nand  not  the  net new jobs added for our purposes,  as  to\r\n\r\nwhich are the areas where locals could actually look at  in\r\n\r\nterms of employment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, if I may refer to the Tables\r\n\r\nwhich I have circulated.

It is the proportion  of  local  and\r\n\r\nforeign workers that we have kept it sensitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to providing information in terms of jobs\r\n\r\nand  employment  change and employment  trends,  these  are\r\n\r\ninternationally accepted criteria, so that  there  is  some\r\n\r\nstandardisation when we are comparing country  to  country.\r\n\r\nWhat  you  do with the information, of course, you  are  at\r\n\r\nliberty  to do so.  And here, I need to make a  point.   If\r\n\r\nsomeone takes the information and says that yes, there  are\r\n\r\njobs  within these sectors but he does not want these  jobs\r\n\r\nin  these  particular sectors - in construction,  domestic,\r\n\r\nmanufacturing - that is his prerogative.  But the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment must still give the figures as they are, so that\r\n\r\nthere  is some level of comparison.  This is what we  would\r\n\r\ncontinue  to do so.  But I have said that I am  mindful  of\r\n\r\nthe  problems  on the ground, that Singaporeans  need  some\r\n\r\ntime  to adjust to jobs which they did not previously like,\r\n\r\nand  that is where we have placed our efforts in trying  to\r\n\r\nget  them  into these previous areas so that we can  reduce\r\n\r\nthe unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, the Minister has not\r\n\r\naddressed  the questions that I have put up.

So  the proportion  in  which  they\r\n\r\noccupy for resident unemployment would be less, about 5-6%.\r\n\r\nAnd  at the top level, 10%, if all of them are economically\r\n\r\nactive.

But let me address his\r\n\r\nquestions  pointedly.   What I did  say  was  that  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers' wages do reduce our overall cost and that  is  how\r\n\r\nwe make our businesses competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to national objectives, I have said that in terms\r\n\r\nof  releasing data, from time to time, there are situations\r\n\r\nwith the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry  of  origin from which these foreign workers  came,\r\n\r\ndespite the most sensitive and cautious handling.   And  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  be  mindful  of this before we  release  all  our\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nMinister  has said that 9 out of 10 jobs went to  residents\r\n\r\nof Singapore. Could he give a breakdown of how many of them\r\n\r\nare  Singaporeans and how many of them are PRs, and whether\r\n\r\nthere is any other category in these figures?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which I would like to raise is that he\r\n\r\nhas mentioned that many Singaporeans do not wish to take up\r\n\r\ncertain  jobs.  There  seems to  be  a  perception  problem\r\n\r\nbecause,  on  the ground, the reaction is different.   Many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans feel that they have not been taken in for jobs\r\n\r\nfor   various  reasons.   Even  when  retrenchments  occur,\r\n\r\nparticularly in our factory or workplace, Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\ngiven  the pink notice while foreigners are still  working.\r\n\r\nSo there could be varied reasons.  But this kind of feeling\r\n\r\ncreates  a lot of unhappiness among Singaporeans.  I  think\r\n\r\nit  is  important to periodically advise employers to  also\r\n\r\nexplain  how  the  retrenchment exercise has  taken  place.\r\n\r\nBesides  that, there are a lot of jobs which  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned.   Can he explain to us how  best  he  could\r\n\r\nredesign  jobs  or  is there any greater emphasis  that  is\r\n\r\nplaced on redesigning jobs so that more Singaporeans  could\r\n\r\ntake up such jobs currently being taken by foreigners?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Nithiah Nandan has asked for\r\n\r\nclarification on the ratio of 9 to 1.  I have  given  these\r\n\r\nstatistics.  It is correct that from 1998 to 2002,  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  102,000 jobs, there was a net creation of 93,000 jobs.\r\n\r\nBut  if  that  ratio does not reflect the  reality  on  the\r\n\r\nground,  it  is so.  That is not the figure  in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace to look at.  What we should be looking at is the  net\r\n\r\nnumber of jobs created and the resident unemployment  rate.\r\n\r\nIf  I could replace our fixation with some numbers, then  I\r\n\r\nwould  say,  let us look at the total number of  jobs  that\r\n\r\nhave  been  created. And the lesson must  surely  be  this:\r\n\r\nthat we have to create enough jobs at least for additional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentrants into our labour force every year.

We are working with\r\n\r\nvarious agencies to try to encourage Singaporeans back into\r\n\r\nthese  jobs.   In  terms of retrenchment exercises,  we  do\r\n\r\nhandle  it  together  with a number of agencies,  including\r\n\r\nNTUC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of redesign, I would ask the Member's\r\n\r\nindulgence to leave that to be further elaborated under the\r\n\r\nWorkforce Development Agency Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister two questions.  Firstly, he made mention of what I\r\n\r\nproposed, that is, try and hire local workers before  going\r\n\r\non to foreigners.  He says that that is more stringent than\r\n\r\nthe  dependency ratio.  I would like to ask how is that so,\r\n\r\nbecause  for the dependency ratio, the employer just  needs\r\n\r\nto employ according to the quota.  He can go ahead and just\r\n\r\nemploy up to the quota available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is, looking at Table 2, the common\r\n\r\nperception  is  that locals shun jobs in the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nand  construction sectors.  Obviously, there  is  truth  to\r\n\r\nthis.  But if you look at the numbers, could it not also be\r\n\r\nthat,  because there is a quota available to  employers  to\r\n\r\nhire foreigners, when jobs are reduced in the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector,  he  just goes ahead to employ up  to  the  maximum\r\n\r\nnumber of foreigners and actually some of these jobs  could\r\n\r\nbe  released to the locals if job redesign or some flexible\r\n\r\nsystem is actually implemented?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, the question to ask is whether\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion proposed by the Member will result in  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   getting  jobs  compared   to   our   current\r\n\r\ndependency  ceiling because there are many instances  where\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have tried to hire locals, and  they  cannot.\r\n\r\nSo  if we implemented that, there may be a net loss of jobs\r\n\r\nfor Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also alluded to the figures on manufacturing and\r\n\r\nwhether our foreign\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworker   policy  has  actually  facilitated  the  exit   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  It would be a fallacy to consider  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of jobs - it is a finite number - and every  number\r\n\r\nthat  you push the foreign worker out, a Singaporean gains.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  so.   As I have said, beyond a tipping  point,\r\n\r\nbeyond  a  certain point, with rigidity within  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket  policies, the economic response would be either  \"I\r\n\r\nrelocate\"  or  \"I  shut  down\".  So  if  we  make  it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  employers to get the type of manpower  they\r\n\r\nneed, they would have to do their calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I am all in favour of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans moving back to manufacturing.  Indeed, we have\r\n\r\nbeen  working with a number of agencies, including MTI  and\r\n\r\nEDB,  to have a manufacturing drive.  The Mayors would tell\r\n\r\nyou  if you ask them.  We have been asking workers why they\r\n\r\nwere afraid of the manufacturing environment and sometimes,\r\n\r\nyou  get  interesting answers.  They thought that when  you\r\n\r\ndon these bunny suits, there must be something contaminated\r\n\r\nabout   the  atmosphere  and,  therefore,  there  must   be\r\n\r\nsomething wrong with the atmosphere.  So we have to correct\r\n\r\nmisperceptions like this.  We would continue  to  work  and\r\n\r\ntry   to  increase  the  numbers  because  there  are  jobs\r\n\r\navailable in the manufacturing sector and there is a steady\r\n\r\npipeline.  We would increase our efforts there as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> Sir, from the statistics that were\r\n\r\ngiven, there is no clarity in the grades of jobs, in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  executives, professionals and the  blue-collar\r\n\r\nrank-and-file jobs.  We see that in recent years, more  and\r\n\r\nmore   of  the  executives  and  professionals  have   been\r\n\r\nretrenched  or have been displaced, and they belong  mainly\r\n\r\nto  the  services  sector.  I am pleased to  see  that  the\r\n\r\nactual  number  of  foreign content has dropped  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears.  But may I ask the Minister what are the chances  of\r\n\r\nthis  group of executives and professionals being  able  to\r\n\r\nget  into the workforce again because this is really a very\r\n\r\nvisible and conspicuous group of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, Mr Loh is quite correct in that\r\n\r\nobservation.

The  figure  was\r\n\r\nabout  40%  of  those retrenched, and that  is  a  sizeable\r\n\r\ndifference  compared to previous years.  But, in  aggregate\r\n\r\nnumbers,  the unemployment rate for those who were  diploma\r\n\r\nand degree holders is still around the national average  of\r\n\r\n4-5%.   It  is  higher than usual, but it is not  different\r\n\r\nfrom the overall figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they face challenges in terms of re-employment?\r\n\r\nDefinitely.   We read articles continuously,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nwhite collar jobs being under threat.  For those of you who\r\n\r\nhave  time,  I would advise you to read the Straits  Times'\r\n\r\narticle  by Chua Mui Hoong on page 12 where she graphically\r\n\r\ndepicts  the problems.  Let me also quote to you  from  the\r\n\r\nAsian Wall Street Journal of Wednesday, 13th August.   This\r\n\r\nwas by Matt Murray.  It reads, \"Sluggish US Recovery Forces\r\n\r\nMany Workers To Lower Their Sights\".  I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In five years at Nortel Networks Corp., Jimmy Richter\r\n\r\nwon  a  series of promotions and saw his salary  more  than\r\n\r\ndouble,  to  $94,000 a year.  He figured the  upward  trend\r\n\r\nwould continue.  But the opposite happened.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was laid off in March 2002, and expected to find a\r\n\r\nnew  job  quickly.  But Mr Ritcher, 30 years  old,  got  no\r\n\r\noffers  in  the  telecommunications  industry,  which   was\r\n\r\nshedding  thousands of jobs of workers.  After six  months,\r\n\r\nhe  ended  up  taking a supervisory job at a cable  company\r\n\r\neven  though it paid little more than half as much  as  his\r\n\r\nold job.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I used to identify myself pretty heavily through\r\n\r\nwork\", says Mr Ritcher. \"Now I'm just Jimmy.

We are under threat.  What is our response?  We will\r\n\r\nhave  to  restructure  and  retrain.

The  Minister has  gone  to  some  length  to\r\n\r\nexplain and lay out the facts clearly to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the outcome of this whole episode is that it\r\n\r\nhas  created a perception in the minds of many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat  the Government data in the public domain may  not  be\r\n\r\ngiving  the  full picture, or the picture is not  complete,\r\n\r\nand  I  agree  with the Minister that this is an  unhelpful\r\n\r\nperception, especially at a time when we should be focusing\r\n\r\non  the  jobs  and  the economy and not  on  data  and  its\r\n\r\ninterpretation  as  such.   So I  would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister in that spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the data as presented in these tables\r\n\r\nare  very  compelling, but the Minister has said that  only\r\n\r\nthe  top  line is available in the public domain.   So  the\r\n\r\nquestion   is,  going  forward,  will  the  Ministry   make\r\n\r\navailable  the additional lines which appear  to  make  the\r\n\r\ncase  moot?  That is the first question I have.  The second\r\n\r\nis, in the job creation data that is in Table 2, broken  up\r\n\r\nby  sectors,  it  is  clear  that  the  services  industry,\r\n\r\nparticularly,  has  been  a  very  strong  engine  of   job\r\n\r\ncreation.  The services industry is a very diverse industry\r\n\r\nand  I  would  like  some clarity or granularity  on  these\r\n\r\nstatistics here.  Would the Minister be able to tell us  at\r\n\r\nwhich  part  of the services industry is the  greatest  job\r\n\r\ncreation  because  that might give us a  sense  as  to  how\r\n\r\neasily  Singaporeans who are displaced from,  for  example,\r\n\r\nthe  manufacturing sector, can retrain and adapt themselves\r\n\r\nto the new opportunities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Iswaran for his views.\r\n\r\nHe  is  quite  right that a single ratio cannot encapsulate\r\n\r\nthe  economic reality of our job market.  We would have  to\r\n\r\nhave a number of figures before we can do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of more data, the point is that the\r\n\r\ninformation  that I have given today may  be  new  to  some\r\n\r\nMembers, but for those Members who had sat with me  in  the\r\n\r\nJob  Task Force and the Economic Review Committee, we  have\r\n\r\ngone  through  these figures many times.  I  have  actually\r\n\r\nmentioned  many  of  these  figures  in  the  House,  maybe\r\n\r\npackaged  differently, but perhaps it was  less  compelling\r\n\r\nbecause  there  was not a backdrop of controversy.   So  if\r\n\r\nthere is any good, at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleast the controversy got us to focus on a few numbers, and\r\n\r\nwe  want to know the numbers very much more.  The truth  is\r\n\r\nthat  from day to day we are inundated with numbers.  So  I\r\n\r\nsuspect  that  even  though if I stood up  and  said  these\r\n\r\nfigures  many months ago, many of you would have  not  even\r\n\r\ntaken notice.  But I take his point that we will try to  do\r\n\r\nour public communications better and compel you to look  at\r\n\r\nour  figures.   And  the  figures  have  been  there.   The\r\n\r\nresident unemployment rate, we said, has gone up.  We  have\r\n\r\nmade  no bones about the fact that foreign workers  form  a\r\n\r\nquarter  of  our population.  Many Ministers have  gone  in\r\n\r\npublic to say that there are 200,000 jobs excluding foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,  construction workers, and  Singaporeans  need  to\r\n\r\ntake back these jobs or take those jobs.  These are not new\r\n\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to breakdown of services, he can get the\r\n\r\ninformation publicly in terms of overall numbers.  That  is\r\n\r\nalso  available.  But if Mr Iswaran would tell me  what  he\r\n\r\nwants, we will try to break it down for him so that  it  is\r\n\r\nsimpler  to understand and easier to encapsulate.  But  the\r\n\r\ninformation is there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, on the issue of the\r\n\r\ncontroversy, I would like to ask the Acting Minister, based\r\n\r\non   the  data  that  is  publicly  available,  would   any\r\n\r\nresearcher have made the same conclusion as the researchers\r\n\r\nfrom  NTU made?  Because I think the impact has been  quite\r\n\r\ntremendous.  People are now doubting both sets of numbers - the  one  that the researchers have given and the one  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister is giving us right now.  My point is, based on\r\n\r\nthe  limited data that any researcher would have, would the\r\n\r\nconclusion had been the same?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I have taken pains to show what\r\n\r\ndata there is.

The Advance Data Release document,  census\r\n\r\ndata,  which  I circulated for year 2000, if  you  look  at\r\n\r\nthat,  it  gives very clearly in absolute numbers what  the\r\n\r\nresident  population  is, what the non-resident  population\r\n\r\nis, from 1990 to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2000.

But  if  you\r\n\r\nwanted  a sectoral breakdown, here I am telling you  a  few\r\n\r\nstatistical tricks, but if you wanted specific  numbers  of\r\n\r\nnon-residents  in goods and services producing  industries,\r\n\r\nmanufacturing, construction, etc, you can  derive  it.   If\r\n\r\nyou  are an academic, you should be able to derive it.   So\r\n\r\nin terms of 1990 to year 2000, we do.  From time to time we\r\n\r\nalso  publish  in  terms  of statements  what  the  general\r\n\r\nnumbers  are.   But all the overall numbers that  you  see,\r\n\r\nboth  in Table 1 and Table 2, are publicly available.   The\r\n\r\nmistake  was  choosing the wrong data set.   We  have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough that and there is no need to elaborate on that.  So\r\n\r\nmy short answer to Mr Inderjit Singh's question is that, at\r\n\r\nleast  for the overall numbers, you would be able to derive\r\n\r\nthe same numbers that I am giving here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> To begin with, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank  the Minister for giving a very comprehensive  answer\r\n\r\nand giving us an opportunity to ask further question on his\r\n\r\nMinisterial  Statement.  I really do not want to  make  his\r\n\r\njob more difficult by exploring more the data, but since he\r\n\r\nhas  given  the data in Table 2, I would like to draw  his,\r\n\r\nand also fellow Members' attention to manufacturing.  I  am\r\n\r\nparticularly  perturbed by the figures.  For  instance,  in\r\n\r\nyear  1998, while there was a shrinkage, you see the locals\r\n\r\nshrunk  by  19,000, foreigners shrunk by 7,000.   In  1999,\r\n\r\nthere  was a growth and locals increased by 400, foreigners\r\n\r\nincreased by 4,000.  As you go down that column,  you  will\r\n\r\nnotice  a  very distinct pattern and the conclusion  I  can\r\n\r\ndraw will be very similar to what my fellow colleagues from\r\n\r\nthe  labour unions have pointed out, ie, Singaporeans  seem\r\n\r\nto be the first to go, last to hire, in manufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at manufacturing specifically, Sir, over\r\n\r\nthe   5-year  period,  while  there  is  a  shrinkage   for\r\n\r\nSingaporean  locals of 28,000-29,000, there is  actually  a\r\n\r\ngrowth  in the foreign workers by 11,900.  So, contrary  to\r\n\r\nour  guidelines in foreign labour and quotas, it seems like\r\n\r\nin  manufacturing the employers seem to have preference for\r\n\r\nforeigners.  Could the Ministry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManpower look at this further and see whether there  should\r\n\r\nbe some adjustments in our employment guidelines?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Dr Wang is quite right. We have\r\n\r\nlooked at that information.  I need to point out to Members\r\n\r\nthat manufacturing also includes the marine industry.   And\r\n\r\nwherever  it is, in manufacturing, we have been  trying  to\r\n\r\nget  Singaporeans back to where there are jobs.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  where there are fewer jobs created, let us  try  to\r\n\r\nput  them where the jobs are.  I do not think that we  want\r\n\r\nto put ourselves in the position of apportioning blame.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, is it because of employer preference,  is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  Singaporeans do not want it, or is it  because  of\r\n\r\nour foreign policy.  To me, I am trying to get workers into\r\n\r\njobs.  And when you finally deal with the problem, there is\r\n\r\na sense of equanimity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the previous exercise, we find that a\r\n\r\nparticular wafer-fab electronics factory went on a roadshow\r\n\r\nand,  out of a few hundreds, finally they could manage just\r\n\r\ntens  of  Singaporeans who entered their  workforce.   What\r\n\r\nwere the reasons?  We will look into them.  We will see how\r\n\r\nwe  can  change mindsets.  There are a number  of  reasons.\r\n\r\nSometimes  it is transport related, sometimes it  is  shift\r\n\r\nrelated.  But, whatever the problems, we will have to solve\r\n\r\nthem  if we are going to bring down our unemployment.   But\r\n\r\nthis  would be a targeted effort and I am glad that Members\r\n\r\ntoo  now  are  aware of it.  So if you have residents,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  who live in particular parts of the island  where\r\n\r\nthere  are  factories,  encourage them  to  go  into  these\r\n\r\nfactories.  We will facilitate.  They can come to MOM, NTUC\r\n\r\nor  Distributed Careerlink Network where we can train them.\r\n\r\nIf  they  are  willing  to go into  these  industries,  for\r\n\r\nexample,    either   precision   engineering,    production\r\n\r\nindustries,  we  will  place them, we  will  sponsor  their\r\n\r\ntraining and we will get them jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am following up on my\r\n\r\nprevious question to the Minister.  On data disclosure,  my\r\n\r\npoint really is, why not take the guesswork out\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  this?   Because the Minister's point was that  data  is\r\n\r\navailable in different forms and different contexts and  if\r\n\r\nyou had induced or done extrapolation on the information to\r\n\r\nget  the  numbers, my point is, given the level  of  public\r\n\r\ninterest in this matter and the Government's clear position\r\n\r\nthat,  in  fact,  the  foreign  worker  policy  is  a  very\r\n\r\ndefensible one, why not come out with the data and  publish\r\n\r\nit openly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point on services industry, just to\r\n\r\nclarify,  the  services sector is a  very  diverse  sector.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to understand better was since there is so much\r\n\r\njob  creation,  is  it  in  the  higher-end  in  terms   of\r\n\r\nprofessional  services, which would make it  difficult  for\r\n\r\nthose displaced from the manufacturing sector, for example,\r\n\r\nto  retrain themselves, or is there greater job creation at\r\n\r\nthe  middle  to  lower-end,  where  perhaps  this  kind  of\r\n\r\ntransition is more easily accomplished?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, my reply to Mr Iswaran is that we\r\n\r\ndo  provide the information, as I have said.  We conform to\r\n\r\ncertain  standards,  but  it would  be  very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nprovide  information for a specific academic research.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, we conform to a benchmark and on  an  overall\r\n\r\nstandard we are ahead of the benchmark in terms of,  as  we\r\n\r\nsaid,  access,  periodicity and  the  comprehensiveness  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  our  information.  We have said that  the  exact\r\n\r\nforeign  worker  numbers are sensitive and we  continue  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  that.  I think it is to our interest to  keep  it\r\n\r\nthat  way.   But, whether we will put out more  timely  and\r\n\r\nmore figures, I think we will consider it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of jobs in the services industry, let me give\r\n\r\nyou a smattering of jobs that are available now.  There are\r\n\r\n7,300 jobs available in the following areas and I will give\r\n\r\nyou  the numbers so that you will have a sense of where the\r\n\r\njobs  are.   Out of the 7,300 jobs, 1,400 in wholesale  and\r\n\r\nretail;  1,200 in community, social and personal  services;\r\n\r\n1,100  in  business  and real estates; 1,600  in  financial\r\n\r\nservices;  1,500  in transport, storage and communications;\r\n\r\nand 700 in hotels and restaurants.  And, yes, there are 800\r\n\r\njobs also in construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  his very detailed and patient reply  to  our\r\n\r\nquestions.   But just to clear any doubts that  the  public\r\n\r\nand,  including  myself,  may have  regarding  this  recent\r\n\r\ncontroversy about ratios, I would like to clarify with  the\r\n\r\nMinister  if  I  am  right to say now  that  what  the  NTU\r\n\r\nprofessors  and  the  Ministry said about  data  not  being\r\n\r\navailable for them to make conclusions about the local  and\r\n\r\nforeign ratio is incorrect because this information, as you\r\n\r\nhave said, is publicly available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> I had wanted not to focus on it, but\r\n\r\nlet  me elaborate just a little bit.  What you can get from\r\n\r\npublic information is the overall number and the shifts  in\r\n\r\npattern within a sector.  Overall numbers are quite  easily\r\n\r\nclear.  What you cannot get is the breakdown in foreign and\r\n\r\nlocal  numbers.  And the reason is that if you  can  get  a\r\n\r\nbreakdown in local numbers then you can by deduction get it\r\n\r\nin  foreign  numbers, except for the document that  I  have\r\n\r\ndistributed,   in  the  year  2000,  where   we   give   it\r\n\r\nspecifically.   So, in other words, we will  not  give  you\r\n\r\nannual  data, we may give every five years, every 10 years.\r\n\r\nSo  that  is the position.  The first mistake was  actually\r\n\r\nthe  overall  numbers.  Because they had used  a  different\r\n\r\ndata  set  and  the  data  set  does  not  allow  you   the\r\n\r\nsensitivity to even arrive at the overall numbers.  So that\r\n\r\nis one of choice, that is not one of our omission.  That is\r\n\r\nreally  their  commission where they chose the  wrong  data\r\n\r\nset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mistake was to actually try to derive the\r\n\r\nnumbers  when someone tells you that you cannot derive  the\r\n\r\nnumbers.  We had made it so and, in fact, my officers  were\r\n\r\njust following policies.  Our statisticians are quite smart\r\n\r\nat  it.  But if you are calculating flow, if you are off by\r\n\r\n10,000-20,000, it makes a big difference into ratios.   But\r\n\r\nthe point is this.  If you want to answer the question, why\r\n\r\nare  we having unemployment problems, ratios would not give\r\n\r\nyou  the  answers.  It cannot be.  What difference does  it\r\n\r\nmake?   In 1993 to 1997, more jobs went to foreigners  than\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  But what of it?  We created 100,000  jobs  a\r\n\r\nyear,  3  jobs  to  every  Singaporeans  that  entered  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  Singaporeans  did  not care and  in  fact  were  happy.\r\n\r\nWithout the foreign workers, our wages would have gone  up,\r\n\r\nour  business  would have stifled, our economy  would  have\r\n\r\ngrown less than what we did.  So, in the first place, it is\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  point  to stare at, the wrong point  to  begin.\r\n\r\nHaving started there and if you want to continue this road,\r\n\r\ncarry  on.  But for me, the emphasis is very clear  -   get\r\n\r\nto  the fundamentals, restructure, get back the jobs.  That\r\n\r\nis where the answer lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I disagree with the Minister\r\n\r\nthat ratio is the wrong point to begin with.  I think it is\r\n\r\nthe  correct  point to begin with at this  point  in  time.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why  the  Minister has  to  answer  questions  in\r\n\r\nParliament today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have to admit that there are too many figures\r\n\r\nfor  me  today.  But for this exercise to be  effective,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it is important that people ought to understand  how\r\n\r\nthese figures were derived.  I am sure he has looked at the\r\n\r\nTable   presented  by  the  NTU  economists   which   shows\r\n\r\ncompletely  different  figures  from  what  he   has   just\r\n\r\npresented to this House.  For example, for the period 1992-1997,  overall  employment, the NTU economists'  figure  is\r\n\r\n254,000 but the Minister's figure is 474,800.  Increase  in\r\n\r\nresident employment, the NTU economists' figure is  205,000\r\n\r\nbut  the  Minister's figure is 183,000.  Overall, for  non-residents, it is contrastingly different, 49,000,  as  what\r\n\r\nthe  NTU economists have asserted, and 291,000 as what  the\r\n\r\nMinister said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure is for the period from 1998 to 2002, but\r\n\r\nthe  NTU economists' figure is from 1997 to 2002.  I do not\r\n\r\nknow  whether there is a difference between the years  1997\r\n\r\nand  1998.  I presume it may not make much difference.  For\r\n\r\nthe  years  between 1997 and 2002, increase in  employment,\r\n\r\nthe overall figures are 102,000 and 187,000 as presented by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  and  NTU economists.   But  the  figure  for\r\n\r\nresident employment is 46,750 as against 93,100 between NTU\r\n\r\neconomists and the Minister's figures.  For foreign  worker\r\n\r\nemployment, the NTU economists' figure is 140,000  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister's figure is 8,900.  The question is how were these\r\n\r\nfigures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nderived.   As  has been explained, the NTU economists  used\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  set of data.  But in the minds of  the  public,\r\n\r\nthey  want to know what went wrong, and how do we know that\r\n\r\nthe figures presented by the Minister are correct.  This is\r\n\r\nfor Table 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at Table 2, it only gives very broad\r\n\r\ncategories of industries.  I think it is meaningful for the\r\n\r\nMinister to answer point by point and say how these figures\r\n\r\nwere derived compared to the figures of the NTU economists,\r\n\r\nwhy  his figures are correct whereas the figures of the NTU\r\n\r\neconomists are not correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I think it would be useful for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to know the figures. I am sure  it  will  not\r\n\r\ncompromise  our  national interests if detailed  employment\r\n\r\ninformation is released to the public.  For instance,  give\r\n\r\nus  more  details for the various sectors,  the  number  of\r\n\r\nforeigners  and  locals who are employed  in  a  particular\r\n\r\nsector, so that Singaporeans will have a better idea of the\r\n\r\ntrue facts.  Of course, when we have full employment and  a\r\n\r\ntight  labour  market, people do not care how many  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers are there.  They have jobs.  But now people do  not\r\n\r\nhave  jobs.   So, to convince Singaporeans, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that the Minister releases those figures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, when Mr Low Thia Khiang says that\r\n\r\nthere  is  not much difference between 187,000 and 102,000,\r\n\r\nthat  is  a  sure  sign  that we have been  inundated  with\r\n\r\nnumbers.  I have said that they started at the wrong point.\r\n\r\nI  am  not  sure  how giving more figures  will  solve  our\r\n\r\nunemployment  problems.  It is as though if I  gave  him  a\r\n\r\nsectoral breakdown, tomorrow the unemployment rate will  go\r\n\r\ndown.   But  I take his point.  So, if Members want  me  to\r\n\r\nspend  time  telling them how we derived these figures,  we\r\n\r\ncould do that.  I could get my statisticians to explain  to\r\n\r\nMembers  how  these numbers are derived, what  our  figures\r\n\r\nare,  and we will invite Mr Low and whoever wants  to  come\r\n\r\nalong and we will tell them what the numbers are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do Singaporeans know that the figures are true?\r\n\r\nThat is a difficult one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow  do  I know that there are X number of births?  I  have\r\n\r\nnot  seen  them.   But the point is that we  stand  by  our\r\n\r\nveracity.  We are trying to solve the problems and  we  are\r\n\r\ninternally  consistent.   We can check  across  information\r\n\r\nthat  we  give from time to time.  Our job is  to  try  and\r\n\r\nsolve  the  unemployment problem.  And when  these  figures\r\n\r\ncome  up,  it is unnecessary distraction, but  we  have  to\r\n\r\nsolve the real problem.  If it satisfies the Member to know\r\n\r\nhow  we  derived  the  numbers, we can easily  arrange  for\r\n\r\nsessions where the statisticians can show him our data  set\r\n\r\nand  within  the  confines possible that  I  have  produced\r\n\r\ntoday, we will show him how these numbers are derived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low has asked for clarifications on how the NTU\r\n\r\nreport  went wrong.  Let me go into the details.   The  NTU\r\n\r\nprofessors started by using the wrong data set.  This was a\r\n\r\nLabour  Force Survey Report.  If Members have time,  please\r\n\r\nlog  on  to  the  MOM website and there is a  Labour  Force\r\n\r\nSurvey  Report.  This Report is not the first  publication.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known report that started in 1976.  The latest\r\n\r\npublication  is  the 24th publication.  So the  limitations\r\n\r\nare   well  known.   In  the  second  page,  in  terms   of\r\n\r\nmethodology, all the classes that are omitted are based  on\r\n\r\nhouseholds  and therefore it does not include construction,\r\n\r\nthose  who stay on offshore islands, seamen, etc.  So there\r\n\r\nare  limitations to the data set and it is  clearly  stated\r\n\r\nthat the numbers are of a certain level of sensitivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the layman to arrive at certain conclusions and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Well,  this is what your report says.  You  gave  me\r\n\r\nthat information.\"  I take it, but I do not expect the same\r\n\r\nkind  of  naivety from academic dons.  In other  words,  if\r\n\r\nthey  wanted the overall numbers, they should not have gone\r\n\r\nto  the  Labour Force Survey Report.  They could have  used\r\n\r\nthe  employment data, another data set which actually gives\r\n\r\nthe numbers and they can calculate that from those numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second mistake was to try to derive the local and\r\n\r\nforeign  share.   What they did was from the  Labour  Force\r\n\r\nSurvey Report, they calculated the employment change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby using decimals. Let us say we have 1 million workers and\r\n\r\nwe  print  the unemployment change figure as  1.2%,  it  is\r\n\r\n12,000.  But we round up the figure because we do not  want\r\n\r\nthe sensitivity.  So it could have been 1.15% or 1.24%.  If\r\n\r\nwe  are  calculating stock, it does not make a  difference.\r\n\r\nBut  the  NTU dons were calculating flow shifts   -   small\r\n\r\nnumbers, even for 10,000, if there was a shift of a flow of\r\n\r\n30,000, it is a 30% difference.  Again, if some Members  of\r\n\r\nthis House make that mistake, I think it is forgivable, but\r\n\r\nless  so  when  you are an academic don.   I  am  not  sure\r\n\r\nwhether that satisfies the Member and whether he wants more\r\n\r\nclarification,  but  I  am quite  open  to  give  him  more\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> They were wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> And, of course, as DPM reminds me, they\r\n\r\nhave  admitted that they were wrong.  They have  said  that\r\n\r\nthey used inappropriate data, that they misjudged the error\r\n\r\nof  sensitivities which brought them to wrong  conclusions.\r\n\r\nSo  I  am not sure why the Member wants to play up or  show\r\n\r\ntheir  mistakes upfront.

The  Director  of  Manpower  is   the\r\n\r\ndesignated Proper Authority for this purpose.   He  has  to\r\n\r\nissue  a  letter of discharge to the serviceman even  after\r\n\r\nthe  military  court has sentenced him.

One  such\r\n\r\nincident occurred here in Singapore in 1991 when SIA flight\r\n\r\nSQ  117  was hijacked while on a shuttle flight from  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The September 11th incident in the United States\r\n\r\nmarked  a  radical change in the terrorist threat to  civil\r\n\r\naviation.   The hijacked airplanes were turned into  flying\r\n\r\nbombs  to  devastating effect with more than  3,000  people\r\n\r\ndead.   Recently, Singapore was also the target of  a  plan\r\n\r\nfor  a similar styled attack.  In early 2002, the Singapore\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah (JI) leader, Mas Selamat Kastari, clearly\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by  the September 11th attack, had  plotted  to\r\n\r\nhijack  an  airplane from Bangkok and crash it into  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport.  To circumvent stringent checks at airports,  they\r\n\r\ndid  not  plan  to carry weapons on board but  to  use  two\r\n\r\nphysically  stronger members in their group to force  their\r\n\r\nway  into the cockpit.  Although the plan was aborted  when\r\n\r\nMas Selamat's name appeared in the media as being wanted in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  JI  activities, the  group  continues  to\r\n\r\nharbour  hopes  of  carrying out this plan  one  day.   Mas\r\n\r\nSelamat has since been arrested but his four associates are\r\n\r\nstill at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The September 11th incident and the Mas Selamat plan's\r\n\r\nare  representative of the new operating environment facing\r\n\r\nus today where terrorists have no qualms about causing mass\r\n\r\ncasualties  and  are fuelled by vague motivations  such  as\r\n\r\nreligious extremism.  These terrorists are also prepared to\r\n\r\nsacrifice  their  own lives in suicide missions.   We  will\r\n\r\nhave to take these threats seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Singapore JI cell has been crippled by\r\n\r\nthe  Internal Security Department's arrests to  the  extent\r\n\r\nthat  it  no longer poses a serious threat to our security,\r\n\r\nthe  terrorist threat to Singapore has not ebbed.   The  Al\r\n\r\nQaeda and regional militant groups like the JI continue  to\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nactive.  The recent bomb attack on the JW Marriott Hotel in\r\n\r\nJakarta on 5th August 2003 is a grim reminder that  the  JI\r\n\r\nis  still  a formidable threat despite the arrests  of  key\r\n\r\nmembers.   The  incident resulted in the first  Singaporean\r\n\r\ncasualties to terrorism possibly since the Laju incident of\r\n\r\n1974.   As  regional governments continue to exert pressure\r\n\r\non  the  militant groups through arrests and  prosecutions,\r\n\r\nthese   groups   will  continue  to  try   and   intimidate\r\n\r\ngovernments.   Singapore  is  no  exception.   Our  actions\r\n\r\nagainst the local JI cell had triggered the unravelling  of\r\n\r\nthe  JI  network in the region.  This can lead to  reprisal\r\n\r\nattacks against Singapore assets here and overseas.  So, we\r\n\r\nare a prime target.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorist threat to us is real and serious.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have to learn to live with this  threat.   It\r\n\r\nwill  be  with us for the long haul.  We have  to  face  it\r\n\r\nsquarely  and take steps to protect ourselves.   Since  the\r\n\r\nSeptember  11th attacks, the Government has done  what  are\r\n\r\npractically possible to prevent terrorism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to counter a September 11th-style attack,\r\n\r\nsecurity  measures  for civil aviation have  to  be  tight.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  key  to  mitigating  any  threat  to   civil\r\n\r\naviation,  including hijacking, is a combination  of  early\r\n\r\nintelligence and robust ground security measures, September\r\n\r\n11th  has  reminded  us  that we must  not  overlook  other\r\n\r\nmeasures   that   can  effectively  prevent   an   aircraft\r\n\r\nhijacking.    Mas  Selamat's  plan  of  commandeering   the\r\n\r\naircraft  without  the  use  of  weapons  shows  that   the\r\n\r\nscreening   for  weapons  at  the  airports  may   not   be\r\n\r\nsufficient.   Comprehensive  security  measures   at   each\r\n\r\npossible  stage  of  air travel are needed.   Some  of  the\r\n\r\naviation  security measures already in place  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ninclude  100%  screening of check-in baggage, strengthening\r\n\r\nof  cockpit  doors and installing close circuit cameras  at\r\n\r\nthe  cockpit  door and enhancing physical  patrols  of  the\r\n\r\nairport compounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our aviation security measures at Changi\r\n\r\nAirport   are  robust,  the  possibility  of  a   hijacking\r\n\r\noccurring on our air carriers arriving from other airports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot  be  discounted.  SIA and SilkAir are considered  at\r\n\r\nrisk because they are icons associated with Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has, therefore, decided to deploy air  marshals\r\n\r\non  board  our national air carriers to secure our aircraft\r\n\r\nduring  flight against any hijacking attempt.  Air marshals\r\n\r\nare  armed  and specially trained officers who will  travel\r\n\r\nincognito,   on  board  flights.   Their  task   will   be,\r\n\r\nprincipally,  to thwart any hijacking attempts.   Recently,\r\n\r\nin November 2002, an attempted hijacking of an El Al flight\r\n\r\nfrom  Tel  Aviv  to  Istanbul was  foiled  by  Israeli  air\r\n\r\nmarshals on board the flight.  Having air marshals on board\r\n\r\nserve  as a deterrent to would-be hijackers.  Here, I  must\r\n\r\nemphasise  that  the  deployment of  air  marshals  on  our\r\n\r\nnational  carriers  is  not  in response  to  any  specific\r\n\r\ncurrent  threat  to  SIA or SilkAir, but  as  part  of  our\r\n\r\noverall  strategy and package of measures  to  enhance  our\r\n\r\naviation security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not alone in wanting to deploy air\r\n\r\nmarshals.  A number of countries have deployed air marshals\r\n\r\non board their national air carriers, as an additional line\r\n\r\nof   defence  should  terrorists  manage  to  slip  through\r\n\r\nintelligence  and ground defences.  The United  States  and\r\n\r\nIsrael  are  some  of  the  forerunners  in  deploying  air\r\n\r\nmarshals  on  their flights.  Since September  11th,  other\r\n\r\ncountries  have similarly begun exploring  or  are  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess of setting up air marshal units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Air Marshal Unit (AMU) will be formed within the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Police Force.  The air marshals  are  handpicked\r\n\r\nofficers and will undergo specialised training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now briefly highlight some of\r\n\r\nthe main issues that are addressed by the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Appointment and Training</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 48B stipulates that the Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  Police may appoint any police officer as an air marshal\r\n\r\nand  ensures  that the air marshals are provided  with  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  training.   It is vital  that  the  officers  be\r\n\r\nadequately trained to deal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  the  range of complex situations that  can  occur  on\r\n\r\nboard an aircraft.  I would like to stress again that every\r\n\r\nair  marshal will undergo extensive training to enable  him\r\n\r\nto   operate  effectively  and  professionally  within  the\r\n\r\nconfines of an aircraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Airline Compliance</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 48C makes it mandatory for national\r\n\r\nair  carriers to accept the deployment of air  marshals  on\r\n\r\nboard  their  flights, with penalties  for  non-compliance.\r\n\r\nNational   air   carriers  are  Singapore  registered   air\r\n\r\ncarriers.   This  clause is to avoid situations  where  the\r\n\r\nairlines  or their crew refuse to accept the deployment  of\r\n\r\nair  marshals,  which  may compromise  security  especially\r\n\r\nwhere  there is intelligence of a terrorist threat  to  the\r\n\r\nflight and cause disruptions to airline operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Powers</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the air marshals are drawn from the Singapore\r\n\r\nPolice  Force, the officers will have the necessary  police\r\n\r\npowers  to  act  on  board an aircraft when  it  is  within\r\n\r\nSingapore's territory.  To remove any ambiguity that  these\r\n\r\npowers  will not extend extra-territorially, the Government\r\n\r\nhas   decided  that  it  would  be  prudent  to   introduce\r\n\r\nlegislation  to specify the powers of the air  marshals  on\r\n\r\nboard  our carriers outside Singapore's airspace.   Section\r\n\r\n48D  will make it clear that police powers will be extended\r\n\r\nto the air marshals when they are on board our air carriers\r\n\r\noutside Singapore territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by amending this Act, we would be\r\n\r\ntaking  concrete steps to identify air marshals  as  police\r\n\r\nofficers  with  the  powers pursuant  to  those  of  police\r\n\r\nofficers.   Furthermore,  the  Bill  would  guarantee   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  right  to  deploy  air  marshals   on   board\r\n\r\nSingapore's national air carriers.  The introduction of air\r\n\r\nmarshals,  in  turn, will contribute to enhancing  aviation\r\n\r\nsecurity  by  making it more difficult  for  terrorists  to\r\n\r\ncarry   out   their   acts  on  board  Singapore-registered\r\n\r\naircraft.   Furthermore, it can help to prevent unnecessary\r\n\r\nloss  of lives when people on the ground inevitably  become\r\n\r\n\"collateral damage\" when the plane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrashes.   The  deployment of air marshals is  therefore  a\r\n\r\nnecessary measure to complement other security measures  to\r\n\r\ncounter  a  September  11th  threat  against  our  national\r\n\r\ncarriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport this Bill really as a very necessary measure in the\r\n\r\nsteps   taken  to  enhance  security,  especially  aviation\r\n\r\nsecurity,  in  the post-911 era.  However,  there  may  be,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  public confidence in this air marshal  scheme,\r\n\r\noccasions  where the public may be alarmed  simply  because\r\n\r\nhitherto  our  attention  has been  to  focus  on  security\r\n\r\nmeasures on the ground to prevent guns and explosives  from\r\n\r\ngetting  on  board aircraft.  However, with this deployment\r\n\r\nof  air marshals, it means that the air marshals themselves\r\n\r\nwould be bringing guns aboard, and the prospect of a shoot-out in a very confined space, of course, would give rise to\r\n\r\nalarm.   So  I  think  it is necessary  in  this  House  to\r\n\r\nreassure  the people that this is actually a very important\r\n\r\nscheme in the context of security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, I would like the Minister just to clarify\r\n\r\na couple of points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I want to ask whether, with this scheme\r\n\r\nin  place, the first priority of security in aviation is to\r\n\r\nprevent  potential  terrorists and offensive  weapons  from\r\n\r\ncoming  on board or being brought on board aircraft.   And,\r\n\r\nsecondly, the Minister has mentioned that the air  marshals\r\n\r\nwould  be  drawn  from the Police and  would  be  specially\r\n\r\ntrained.   Of course, there is a whole world of  difference\r\n\r\nbetween training police officers for law enforcement on the\r\n\r\nground and training them for enforcement in the air.  So  I\r\n\r\nwould like to know whether air marshals would be trained in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  way  as  to ensure that the performance  of  their\r\n\r\nduties  under  such situations would be expertly  done  and\r\n\r\nwith  the safety of passengers, crew and aircraft in  mind.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the proposed Bill says that air marshals  will  be\r\n\r\ndeployed when there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  high security risks involved.  So I want to know  what\r\n\r\nactually does that mean.  Does it mean that we will,  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  routine, put air marshals on  board  Singapore-registered  planes?   Or does it mean  that  only  in  very\r\n\r\nspecific  instances  would you  have  to  deploy  such  air\r\n\r\nmarshals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the air marshals legislation is important\r\n\r\nbecause, as the Minister has mentioned, many countries have\r\n\r\nalready put these air marshals into service.  If I may  put\r\n\r\na  scenario  in  this way.  If in a whole  row  of  houses,\r\n\r\nalmost  all  of  them,  except one, had  installed  burglar\r\n\r\nalarms,  then  it is quite obvious that the burglars  would\r\n\r\nchoose  the one without the burglar alarm.   So I think  it\r\n\r\nis  obvious that we have to have such legislation.   But  I\r\n\r\nhope that the Minister would be able to reassure the people\r\n\r\nthat, even with the deployment of such air marshals, safety\r\n\r\nand  security  in  the planes would not be  compromised  by\r\n\r\ntheir deployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Thank you, Sir, for giving me the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  speak.   Those  of  us  who  watched  over\r\n\r\ntelevision the events of September 11 when terrorists  used\r\n\r\ncommercial  aeroplanes to attack the  Twin  Towers  in  New\r\n\r\nYork, resulting in about 300,000 deaths, will agree ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> 3,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> About 3,000 deaths. They will\r\n\r\nagree  that there is a need for security measures on  board\r\n\r\ncommercial  flights.   The Police  Force  (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nwhere provisions are made for the Commissioner of Police in\r\n\r\nSingapore to allow him to deploy air marshals on board  any\r\n\r\nSingapore  aircraft  is  timely.   I  understand  that,  in\r\n\r\nAmerica,  it was only after the pulling out of air marshals\r\n\r\nfrom  commercial  flights that the terrorist  attacks  took\r\n\r\nplace  on September 11.  But of course, it cannot be  said,\r\n\r\nwith  certainty,  that the posting of  security  guards  on\r\n\r\nboard  an  aircraft shall prevent terrorist  activities  on\r\n\r\nboard  that aircraft.  But I think most will agree that  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  some form of policing on board an  aircraft,  it\r\n\r\nwill to a certain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeasure deter or even counter terrorists assaults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope in time Singapore can emulate the Israelis.\r\n\r\nThe Israeli Airline, El Al's policy is never to give in  to\r\n\r\nterrorists.  As a result, despite the Israeli war with  the\r\n\r\nArabs,  the  El Al Airline has a good record of not  having\r\n\r\nany  recent  hijacking.  This kind of  policy  entails  the\r\n\r\nnecessity to build a commando force on standby, ready to go\r\n\r\ninto  action  whenever  it is called  upon  to  do  so,  to\r\n\r\nexterminate and flush out terrorists from an aeroplane that\r\n\r\nis hijacked by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of this Bill is only a part in the\r\n\r\nbuilding of a complex process of fighting terrorism.  For a\r\n\r\nstart, air marshals must be specially selected and trained.\r\n\r\nI would say that air marshals most likely shall be selected\r\n\r\nfrom  members of the Special Operations Unit or the  Police\r\n\r\nSpecial Force.  Those selected to be trained must not  only\r\n\r\nbe  physically fit but also mentally strong and  they  even\r\n\r\nhave  to undergo psychological tests to make sure that they\r\n\r\nare  suitable.   They  must  be people  with  well-adjusted\r\n\r\npersonality and they do not succumb to stress.   They  have\r\n\r\nto  be  highly trained with weapons and martial arts.   One\r\n\r\ncan  easily  see that air marshals should be quite  special\r\n\r\npeople  and they therefore shall not come cheap.   In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, I hope that the airlines shall not use the  excuse\r\n\r\nof  the necessity to deploy air marshals to increase  their\r\n\r\nfares to exorbitant levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the airlines, they should also play\r\n\r\ntheir  part  to  provide security.   I  hear  that  certain\r\n\r\nairlines  are already providing bullet-proof doors  to  the\r\n\r\npilots'  cabin and those doors are constructed  to  prevent\r\n\r\nthem  from  being broken down by intruders.   The  airlines\r\n\r\nmust  also  ensure that the aeroplane windows are  provided\r\n\r\nwith  glass that will not shatter when they are  hit  by  a\r\n\r\nbullet.   I  do  hope that the Singapore  Police  can  also\r\n\r\nprovide  our air marshals with special guns, or stun  guns,\r\n\r\nwhose  bullets will not pierce the skin of the  aeroplane's\r\n\r\nfuselage or shatter the glass of its windows.  This type of\r\n\r\nspecial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nguns,  when  used  by  the  air  marshals,  can  immobilise\r\n\r\nterrorists, but they do not damage the aeroplane.  I  hope,\r\n\r\nwith the passing of this Bill, Singapore Airlines' motto of\r\n\r\n\"A safe way to fly\" shall add another dimension to it, that\r\n\r\nis, \"A safe way to fly from the security point of view\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think one day, air marshals should be as common\r\n\r\nas  the  seat belts in the aeroplanes.  Sir, when that  day\r\n\r\ncomes, I wonder whether there will be law suits against the\r\n\r\nairlines if a passenger should suffer damage as a result of\r\n\r\nsome airlines, for reasons of their own, not deploying  air\r\n\r\nmarshals on board that plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to bring up with the\r\n\r\nMinister   is   that  this  amendment  Bill  gives   extra-territorial powers to our Police Force.  Would  it  not  be\r\n\r\nbetter if our Government enters into agreements with  those\r\n\r\ncountries that the aeroplanes are flying to, to get  powers\r\n\r\nto enforce certain laws in those countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I presume you support the Bill, Mr Chiam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. I do certainly support the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Both Mr Chiam and Prof. Chin are\r\n\r\nconcerned about the training and the selection of  our  air\r\n\r\nmarshals.   Let  me assure Members, as well as  the  people\r\n\r\noutside,  that  the officers in the Air  Marshal  Unit  are\r\n\r\nexperienced  police officers, and they  are  selected  from\r\n\r\nspecialised units and under stringent criteria.  So whether\r\n\r\nthey  are from the Special Operation Force or whether  they\r\n\r\nare  from the Special Unit, etc, I am sure we have  scoured\r\n\r\nthe  whole  Police Force to look for the right people  with\r\n\r\nthe  correct temperament to undergo the training.  We  will\r\n\r\nparticularly  train  them  on how  to  operate  within  the\r\n\r\nconfines of an aircraft.  It is quite different training  a\r\n\r\npolice  officer to deal with ground situations, whether  it\r\n\r\nis  on  the  streets,  in the markets, or  whatever  public\r\n\r\nplace.   An  aircraft is a confined space, limited  by  its\r\n\r\nsize, and there are many people in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the officers have to be trained on aviation\r\n\r\nsecurity as well and how to cope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  such a situation when they are in the plane with many\r\n\r\npassengers.  They  have  to think  calmly  under  stressful\r\n\r\nsituations and there may be little time to react.  But they\r\n\r\nwill  not  just shoot on the count of one and  just  shoot.\r\n\r\nThey  will  look and assess the situation carefully  before\r\n\r\nthey  take  appropriate  measures  to  try  to  disarm  the\r\n\r\nhijackers.   They  will employ unarmed and  close-encounter\r\n\r\ncombat skills first before they decide to use weapons as  a\r\n\r\nlast resort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The selection of weapons of course is another\r\n\r\nconsideration.  The Police will make sure that  it  is  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  weapon where it will not cause a disaster  in  the\r\n\r\nplane while it is in flight.  Air marshals are very skilful\r\n\r\npeople  and  they  are marksmen.  We want  people  who  can\r\n\r\nreally  shoot straight, if they have to.  But we hope  that\r\n\r\nin  a  situation where they have to deal with  a  hijacking\r\n\r\nsituation,  that would be the last thing they  need  to  do\r\n\r\nwithout  endangering  the safety  of  the  passengers.   So\r\n\r\nuppermost in their minds, when they exercise their  powers,\r\n\r\nwill  be  the  safety  of the passengers  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nairplanes and an assessment would be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked under what prevailing threat\r\n\r\nsituations  do we deploy air marshals in an  aircraft.   We\r\n\r\nwill  deploy  air  marshals depending  on  the  global  and\r\n\r\nregional  security threat situation.  Before  we  make  any\r\n\r\ndecision  to  deploy, we will, in close collaboration  with\r\n\r\nmany  other agencies, determine the threat level.  And once\r\n\r\nwe  feel that there is a need to deploy air marshals in the\r\n\r\naircraft, we would do so.  I cannot describe exactly  under\r\n\r\nwhat  circumstances will an air marshal be deployed because\r\n\r\nto do so would simply compromise our deployment plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked about the jurisdiction of the air\r\n\r\nmarshals.   If  they  are  on board a  Singapore-registered\r\n\r\naircraft,  Singapore  would have jurisdiction.   When  they\r\n\r\narrive at the destination, then of course we will hand over\r\n\r\nthat  jurisdiction  to the destination  country.   But  all\r\n\r\nthese   are   matters  which  are  under  negotiation   and\r\n\r\ndiscussion  with  the  countries concerned.   And,  indeed,\r\n\r\nbefore  we  fly  an  aircraft  with  air  marshals   to   a\r\n\r\ndestination country, we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill have agreements with the countries concerned that they\r\n\r\nwill  accept the deployment of air marshals.  I can  assure\r\n\r\nthe  House  that  discussion is already taking  place  with\r\n\r\nseveral  countries.  Once we have firmed  up  and  got  the\r\n\r\nagreement, we will start deploying.  I cannot tell  exactly\r\n\r\nwhen  that will take place.  But I can say that it will  be\r\n\r\nvery  soon because we already have officers who are trained\r\n\r\nas  air marshals and we have put them through training, not\r\n\r\njust  with  people  who  know the  business,  but  we  have\r\n\r\nconsultants  who come and help us to train.  We  have  also\r\n\r\nsent  our officers overseas to learn from other air marshal\r\n\r\nunits  the  kind of skills, training and people  that  they\r\n\r\nneed to have before they can be deployed as air marshals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the Israeli example, that is one of the\r\n\r\ncountries that we have learned from, and there are  several\r\n\r\nothers.   I quoted two countries - Israel and the US.   But\r\n\r\nthe  Germans, Swiss and Australians also have air marshals.\r\n\r\nWe  have  been  in close touch with all these  agencies  to\r\n\r\nlearn from them.  We will learn and try to adapt it to  our\r\n\r\nown situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this answers the questions by the two Members.\r\n\r\nBut I also want to stress here that it is not just carrying\r\n\r\narms  on  board  that will cause a potential  threat.   The\r\n\r\nexample  I  cited is Mas Selamat and his associates.   They\r\n\r\ndid  not  want to carry weapons on board.  They are looking\r\n\r\nfor  some  heavy-built individuals  who  can  go  into  the\r\n\r\ncockpit to overcome the pilots.  But SIA has, over the last\r\n\r\nyear  or  two  since September 11, started  to  harden  its\r\n\r\naircraft  as  well as its cockpit area.  They have  put  in\r\n\r\nCCTVs and they have hardened the cockpit doors which cannot\r\n\r\nbe easily broken into.  So the airline operators themselves\r\n\r\nhave  also  taken  measures  to strengthen  security.   But\r\n\r\nbefore  anyone can carry weapons on board, the first  thing\r\n\r\nwe  should do is to detect him at the check-in gate  before\r\n\r\nwe  allow him to fly.  That is the process that we need  to\r\n\r\ndo   very  stringently.   As  far  as  Changi  Airport   is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we  have  been  applying  these  measures  very\r\n\r\nstringently.  We are working with other foreign governments\r\n\r\nto also tighten up security measures where our national air\r\n\r\ncarriers fly to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind Members that we still have one more\r\n\r\nBill,  the  Singapore  Workforce Development  Agency  Bill,\r\n\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PUBLIC INFORMATION PROCESSES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.02 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me this opportunity to speak on the subject of\r\n\r\npublic information processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am raising this matter about information in the\r\n\r\npublic  domain  as  I do not want to go  into  this  recent\r\n\r\nincident  involving  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  and   the\r\n\r\nuniversity dons.  Mine is of wider scope and, as a citizen,\r\n\r\nI  feel  quite  strongly that what falls  into  the  public\r\n\r\ndomain  is  something that perhaps we ought to relook.   On\r\n\r\nthat  premise, these are the three primary issues  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to raise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask for greater clarity on what\r\n\r\nconstitutes  public  information,  who  decides  that  such\r\n\r\ninformation be labelled as \"sensitive\" or \"in the  national\r\n\r\ninterests\".   I understand that nationally there  are  four\r\n\r\ncategories     for     classifying     information,     ie,\r\n\r\nConfidential/Restricted, Secret, Top Secret and Top  Secret\r\n\r\nand  Cicero.   Understandably, as one moves up the  secrecy\r\n\r\nladder,  fewer and fewer people have access to the  various\r\n\r\ngrades  of  information.  But what will be  useful  to  the\r\n\r\ncommon person is to share with the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic  how  such  information  is  classified,  how  these\r\n\r\nclassifications  of information are implemented,  and  what\r\n\r\nreally are the parameters around such information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a lack of clarity has given rise to some of the\r\n\r\nfollowing instances cited by various people I spoke  to  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  from  my  own  experiences as  an  ex-journalist:\r\n\r\nprofiling  of teachers by gender and age becomes  sensitive\r\n\r\ninformation  not  open to the public domain;  breakdown  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  by  nationalities is  secret;  emigration\r\n\r\nfigures are sensitive; number of prisoners on death row  is\r\n\r\nsensitive; the criteria used to categorise employment  pass\r\n\r\nholders as Category 1 or 2 are classified information;  the\r\n\r\nnumber of people who are in debt over mortgage payments  is\r\n\r\na  difficult  no-no;  the number of ITE  students  entering\r\n\r\npolytechnic or the number of polytechnic students  entering\r\n\r\nuniversity - for these instances, the feedback one gets  at\r\n\r\nthe first entry point is that the information is sensitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then are the classification codes for the above\r\n\r\nexamples,  and who decides?  Has any such information  been\r\n\r\nupgraded  to  a  higher level among the four categories  or\r\n\r\ndowngraded  and  released into the public domain?   If  so,\r\n\r\nwhen  does  this happen?  What is the criterion surrounding\r\n\r\nthat?  These answers can help the common person to at least\r\n\r\nunderstand how information is disseminated and communicated\r\n\r\nto the general public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern that I have is the process by which\r\n\r\ninformation is gathered and collated across the  Ministries\r\n\r\nin  terms of consistency.  For example, if the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational Development collates its figures on its tenants in\r\n\r\n1-room and 2-room flats and if that data is used to reflect\r\n\r\nor  categorise residents as either the \"Still Poor\" lot  or\r\n\r\nthe  \"New  Poor\" - this same kind of database is  stretched\r\n\r\nacross  to be used by other Ministries to identify who  are\r\n\r\nthe  poor among us and what kind of schemes should be  used\r\n\r\nto  help  them.   My  question  is  if  such  collation  of\r\n\r\ninformation is consistent and in keeping with the  changing\r\n\r\ntimes of our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to highlight that the\r\n\r\ncriteria  used to collate information needs reviewing.   If\r\n\r\nwe  are  really  to  know how a society is  evolving,  then\r\n\r\nequally  important is the process of information gathering.\r\n\r\nOften,  there is an over-generalisation or over-summarising\r\n\r\nof categories.  We heard an instance just now when the hon.\r\n\r\nMember,  Mr Iswaran, brought up the example of the  service\r\n\r\nindustry.   If an over-summarised figure is in  the  public\r\n\r\ndomain,   it  is  sometimes  hard  to  know  what   exactly\r\n\r\nconstitutes the service industry and how it is impacted.  I\r\n\r\nsit  in AWARE's Sub-Committee on Women and Ageing.  We have\r\n\r\ncome across quite good data on women-headed households  but\r\n\r\nare  stuck  when it comes to secondary data.  It  is  quite\r\n\r\nelusive.  Who constitutes a woman-headed household?  Is  it\r\n\r\na  divorcee, a single-again person or a single person?  Why\r\n\r\ncan  this  kind  of information not also  be  made  readily\r\n\r\navailable in the public domain?  That is as an example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third concern is that sometimes in policy-making\r\n\r\nissues, we tend to place a greater emphasis on quantitative\r\n\r\ninformation at the expense of qualitative data.    To  cite\r\n\r\nan example that appeared in the recent edition of Life!, Dr\r\n\r\nNirmala Purushotam, an ex-academic don, struck a chord when\r\n\r\nshe was commenting on the quantitative data on inter-racial\r\n\r\nmarriages.  The quantitative data will show that we are  in\r\n\r\na healthy situation, there is greater integration among the\r\n\r\ndifferent  races.   But  her quote  begs  another  question\r\n\r\nwhether a qualitative analysis might show that perhaps some\r\n\r\nindividuals are not marrying their own kind in an  inverted\r\n\r\nstereotyping of one's own race.  That, I think, has its own\r\n\r\nimplications.   And  we  again  heard  just  now  from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Manpower, when we were  talking  about  this\r\n\r\nissue,  that there are jobs, it is not a question of  race,\r\n\r\nbut   there  are  jobs  for  Singaporeans  and  there   are\r\n\r\nemployers.   If the two are not matching, then we  have  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  it  is  not  happening.   That  becomes  a\r\n\r\nqualitative  analysis that will steer policy-making  and/or\r\n\r\ncommunication issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to say that managing\r\n\r\ninformation is a communication process.  It could  be  less\r\n\r\ntop-down,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore engaging of public stakeholders, less critical of  the\r\n\r\nrole played by academics, journalists, civil society groups\r\n\r\nand private citizens, who believe that they have a stake in\r\n\r\nthis  country.   A  maturing society cannot  be  told  that\r\n\r\ninformation  is  sensitive  and then  expected  to  retreat\r\n\r\nwithout  good  valid explanations.  The  fewer  closed-door\r\n\r\nfeedback  sessions we have with the public,  the  more  all\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  including  private enterprises,  open  their\r\n\r\ndoors  to sharing information with the public, then we  are\r\n\r\nreally on the road to becoming a more mature society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, the cue is taken from the top. We have now\r\n\r\nseen  some  institutions with annual reports  that  display\r\n\r\nover-summarised  financial statement pages,  and  heads  of\r\n\r\ndepartments  who do not share information  with  their  own\r\n\r\nstaff  because it is considered privileged.   If  there  is\r\n\r\ngreater openness from the top down, people below too can be\r\n\r\nsharing  information that, more often than not, is actually\r\n\r\nnot sensitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to suggest to the Government that\r\n\r\nperhaps  it is time to consider a Declassification  Act  so\r\n\r\nthat  in another 30 years or so a citizen can exercise  the\r\n\r\nright  to  ask  for files to read and look for  himself  or\r\n\r\nherself  a  part  of  Singapore's  history  and  to   fully\r\n\r\nunderstand  and comprehend our evolution as a  nation.   If\r\n\r\nthat  can  be  done,  it  would be wonderful.  For  now,  I\r\n\r\npersonally think that getting to information is  still  not\r\n\r\nan easy road and there are many road blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last word on this matter is a challenge: how ready\r\n\r\nare  we  to  share  retrenchment  figures  by  ethnic-based\r\n\r\ngroups?  The usual stuff that comes up with that is that it\r\n\r\nhas to do with our national interests, our neighbours, etc.\r\n\r\nIt  is understandable.  But this is our country and this is\r\n\r\nour  home.   If  retrenchment figures  are  skewed  in  any\r\n\r\nparticular way against any ethnic group, then it is good to\r\n\r\nsee  what  is the qualitative data that supports that,  and\r\n\r\nthen  put in the skills programmes to equip each and  every\r\n\r\nperson  and, if it is a language-speaking capability,  then\r\n\r\nto  look at whether it is a backroom operation or a  frontend operation that has brought\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout the retrenchment.  And if it is really something that\r\n\r\nspeaks  of certain prejudices, then this society  needs  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  itself  and come up with a better  model  through\r\n\r\nbetter  communication, and we will all have  to  play  that\r\n\r\nrole in eradicating any form of prejudice, if it does exist\r\n\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Ms Braema has raised several\r\n\r\ninteresting issues.  I would just like to say, as a general\r\n\r\nrule, our approach is to publish whatever information  that\r\n\r\nis  useful  to  the  public, information  that  is  timely,\r\n\r\nregular and accurate.  So, there is no holding back in  the\r\n\r\npublication  of  information.  Only a very  small  category\r\n\r\nwhich is considered security in nature would be controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general rule, we do not believe in hiding bad\r\n\r\nnews,  we do not believe in hiding data, we do not  believe\r\n\r\nin   projecting  a  misleading  impression  by  suppressing\r\n\r\nawkward  facts.   Our approach is to bring  out  the  facts\r\n\r\nopenly  and  discuss them.  But we do recognise that  there\r\n\r\ncould   be  some  sensitivities  involved  and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nsometimes, before we present the facts, we really  have  to\r\n\r\nprepare  the  ground, because we do not want the  facts  to\r\n\r\ncome out too cold and the ground is not readily prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, for some of the issues that the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  has raised, by all means file a Question  here  and\r\n\r\nthe  data will be made available.  Such information can  be\r\n\r\navailable through different channels.  As I have mentioned,\r\n\r\none of the common channels is for Members to file Questions\r\n\r\nto  obtain  specific answers to the areas of interest  that\r\n\r\nthey  have.  Members of the public can also write in, email\r\n\r\nin  or phone in for information.  As an ex-journalist,  the\r\n\r\nMember  should  know  that journalists  do  pose  questions\r\n\r\nregularly  to  the  Ministries  and  the  Ministries   will\r\n\r\nrespond.  Journalists also have interviews with politicians\r\n\r\nto  gather  insights into issues of public  interest.   So,\r\n\r\nthere  is a multitude of avenues for which information  can\r\n\r\nbe  sought.  If I may just go through the specific examples\r\n\r\nraised by the Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, profiling of teachers by gender and age. RAdm\r\n\r\nTeo just brought the document, and this is an open document\r\n\r\nand the tables are in there.  So, the information is in the\r\n\r\npublic domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification of information into Confidential,\r\n\r\nSecret, Top Secret, Top Secret and Cicero, these are  fixed\r\n\r\nregulations,  and everybody in the Ministry  knows  how  to\r\n\r\nclassify  them,  depending on the impact on  security.   In\r\n\r\nmost Ministries, such classifications are not germane.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health,  for  example,  does  not   go   into\r\n\r\nclassification  of  Cicero or Top Secret.   Most  data  are\r\n\r\nopen.   So, you will find that, for most of the Ministries,\r\n\r\nwhether   it  is  on  real  estate,  health  or   community\r\n\r\ndevelopment, we follow the classification and the standards\r\n\r\nand  parameters  set  down  by the international  agencies,\r\n\r\nwhether   it  is  ILO  or  WHO  or  WTO.   Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nclassifications  that  the Member raised  just  now  -  the\r\n\r\ncriteria,  the classification, the parameters -  we  follow\r\n\r\ninternational norms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other example which she has raised about\r\n\r\nclassification  of poor people in 1- and  2-room  flats,  I\r\n\r\nthink the most sensible way to classify whether a person is\r\n\r\npoor or not is by the income, either by household or by per\r\n\r\ncapita  and  that  is  a  standard classification.   We  do\r\n\r\nsometimes  use  a proxy, say, for example, utility  rebates\r\n\r\nbecause to gather household income and to get the household\r\n\r\nper  capita  income  is  a  very  laborious  process.   So,\r\n\r\nsometimes,  we do use household types as proxies.   But  if\r\n\r\nyou  have been moving around the HDB estates, you will find\r\n\r\nthat many of the people who live in 1- and 2-room flats are\r\n\r\nby no means poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that our classification goes by\r\n\r\ninternational  definitions.  The question that  the  Member\r\n\r\nraised  about  secondary  classification,  again,  I  would\r\n\r\nencourage her, where she has special interests, like  AWARE\r\n\r\nand  she  wants to go into households headed by  women  and\r\n\r\nwant  a  breakdown  on  whether it is single,  divorced  or\r\n\r\nwidowed,   do  raise  these  questions  with  the  relevant\r\n\r\nMinistries.  I am sure that they would try and  gather  the\r\n\r\ndata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times when we were given these Questions in\r\n\r\nParliament, in the limited time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  we have, our staff would scramble around and  try  to\r\n\r\nget  the  information.   But unless  we  have  a  recurring\r\n\r\ninterest in this area, it is not cost-effective to set up a\r\n\r\nwhole  data  set  just to collect a set of data  because  a\r\n\r\nMember finds it interesting.  I would like to urge Members,\r\n\r\nwhen they file a Question, to remember that there is a cost\r\n\r\nto  all the information collection.  During this period  of\r\n\r\nfiscal restraint, I would like all Members to consider that\r\n\r\nfactor carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On qualitative and quantitative data, that is an\r\n\r\ninteresting point that she has raised.  We always  want  to\r\n\r\nraise the quality of our data.  The Chief Statistician  and\r\n\r\nthe  people in this business would always be very happy  to\r\n\r\nget feedback from all of you on how to raise the quality of\r\n\r\nthe data which they publish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point that she made was about managing\r\n\r\ninformation and that we should be more engaging,  ie,  less\r\n\r\ntop-down,  fewer  closed-door  feedback  sessions,  greater\r\n\r\nopenness.    We   all   subscribe  to   these   sentiments.\r\n\r\nSometimes,   we  do  have  closed-door  feedback   sessions\r\n\r\nprimarily  to  encourage more frankness  in  the  dialogues\r\n\r\nrather  than people playing to the gallery or people giving\r\n\r\nfeedback  but not in a very frank manner.  So it is  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  organising agency whether they have it closed-door  or\r\n\r\nopen-door.  There  is  no  rule from  the  Government  that\r\n\r\nfeedback sessions should be closed-door.  It depends on the\r\n\r\njudgement whether we get better and more frank feedback  in\r\n\r\nclosed-door sessions rather than open to the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's point about Declassification Act or\r\n\r\nFreedom  of  Information Act is an interesting  suggestion.\r\n\r\nIt  is also something that the Remaking Singapore Committee\r\n\r\nhas  put up and I am sure that the relevant Ministry  would\r\n\r\nbe studying it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this answers the Member's questions.\r\n\r\nBasically,  I  just  want to summarise  and  say  that  our\r\n\r\napproach  is  to  be  as open as possible  and  to  provide\r\n\r\ninformation  which is useful.  The only  time  we  restrict\r\n\r\ninformation  is when the information impacts  our  national\r\n\r\ninterests.   By national interests, let me define  this  by\r\n\r\ngiving some examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that certain information, if released, can\r\n\r\nundermine  our  security  or  economic  interests  or   may\r\n\r\njeopardise the political and social stability that we  have\r\n\r\nenjoyed.  So there are clear limits as to how much we  will\r\n\r\nspeak  about  our defence and intelligence  capability.   I\r\n\r\nthink  those  classifications that she has talked  about  - Confidential, Secret, Top Secret, Top Secret and  Cicero  - are   extremely  relevant  in  the  arena  of  defence  and\r\n\r\nintelligence capability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is financial reserves. We will not\r\n\r\npublish our total financial reserves or how we invest  them\r\n\r\nbecause  this would give opportunity to those who  mean  us\r\n\r\nill  to use this information to speculate and threaten  our\r\n\r\nfinancial stability.  If you look at the data we produce  - the  fiscal  data, the economic statistics,  the  financial\r\n\r\nstatistics - these are all very comprehensive and they meet\r\n\r\ninternational standards and IMF requirements.  But we  stop\r\n\r\nshort  of giving details of total reserves and the  mix  of\r\n\r\ntotal  reserves because that is in our national  interests.\r\n\r\nBeyond  that, if you go through the statistics, whether  it\r\n\r\nis  national  accounts  statistics or economic  statistics,\r\n\r\nthese  are all very comprehensive and they meet everybody's\r\n\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must always be mindful of our small size - our vulnerability to external forces and our context in\r\n\r\nthis  region.    We  should  not see  ourselves  as  a  big\r\n\r\ncontinent  like the United States.  So be mindful  of  this\r\n\r\npeculiarity  of  Singapore.  Other than these  criteria,  I\r\n\r\nthink   the   Government  stands  by  its   position   that\r\n\r\ninformation would be open and information that  is  useful,\r\n\r\nwe will release it.  We encourage Members to file Questions\r\n\r\nto get information in specific areas of their interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Nineteen Minutes past Five o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BRIDGE AT THE CAUSEWAY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Transport\r\n\r\nin  view  of Malaysia's announcement to build a  bridge  to\r\n\r\nreplace  the  Causeway (i) what will be the extent  of  the\r\n\r\nimpact on our own seaport and  (ii) what are the plans  and\r\n\r\nstrategies  to cushion such an impact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia has announced plans to replace half the\r\n\r\nCauseway  with a bridge.
